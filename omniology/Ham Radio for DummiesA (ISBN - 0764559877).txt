About the Author
Ward Silver NØAX has been a licensed ham since 1972 at the age of 17. Ward’s
experiences in ham radio contributed greatly to a 20-year career in broadcast-
ing and as an electrical engineer and programmer, developing instrumentation
and medical electronics. In 2000, he turned to teaching and writing as a second
career. He is currently adjunct faculty with Seattle University’s Electrical and
Computer Engineering department, concentrating on laboratory instruction.
You can find his monthly columns and articles in QST magazine and in the
biweekly e-mail newsletter, “The Contester’s Rate Sheet.” He is the author of
the ARRL’s online course, “Antenna Design and Construction.” His ham radio
interests include multi-operator and low-power (QRP) contesting, DX-ing, 
and antenna design. He is the author of “NØAX’s Radio Puzzler” (a collection 
of quizzes and puzzles), and co-author (with K7LXC) of “HF Tribander
Performance - Test Methods & Results” and “HF Vertical Performance - Test
Methods & Results.” He is the winner of the 2003 Bill Orr Technical Writing
Award.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my all-ham family — my wife Nancy W7FIR and sons
Webster KD7FYX and Lowell KD7DQO — who frequently see little of Dad except
the back of his head as he hammers away at the keyboard creating another arti-
cle or chapter. And dedicated as well to my own ham radio Elmers: Bill KJ7PC,
Randy WB9FSL, Jerry WAØACF, and Danny K7SS who helped me turn “Can I?”
into “I did!”  Thanks, one and all!
Author’s Acknowledgments

Ham Radio For Dummies

Introduction
A
mateur or ham radio has been around for nearly a century. In that time,
it’s grown, branched, morphed, and amplified itself into a worldwide
community of licensed hams tickling the airwaves with every conceivable
means of communications technology. Its practitioners range in age from
preschoolers to septuagenarians. Ham radio’s siren call attracts those who
have never held a microphone as well as deep technical experts who grew up
with a soldering iron and computer.
You may have come across ham radio in any number of ways: in movies such
as Frequency or Contact, in books (the comic book hero TinTin is a ham), from
seeing them in action performing emergency communications services, or
maybe from a friend or relative who enjoys the hobby. Interestingly enough,
ham radio has room for all of these activities. Yes, even a mad scientist or two
are in the ham ranks. Most, however, are just like you.
The storied vision finds the ham bent over a glowing radio, surrounded by all
manner of electronic gadgets and flicking meters, tapping out messages on a
telegraph key or speaking into a large, round, silvery microphone. Today’s
ham has many more options than that to try! While the traditional shortwave
bands are still crowded with ham signals hopping around the planet, hams
now transmit data and pictures through the airwaves, use the Internet, lasers,
and microwave transmitters, and travel to unusual places high and low to
make contact.
Simply stated, ham radio provides the broadest and most powerful wireless
communications capability available to any private citizen anywhere in the
world. Because the world’s citizens are craving ever-closer contact, ham radio
is attracting attention from people like you. The hobby has never had more
to offer and shows no sign of slowing its expansion into new wireless tech-
nologies. Did I say wireless? Think Extreme Wireless!
About This Book
I wrote Ham Radio For Dummies for beginning hams. If you just became inter-
ested in ham radio, you find plenty of information here to explain what the
hobby is all about and how to go about joining the fun by discovering the
basics and getting a license.

If you already received your license, congratulations! This book helps you
change from a listener to a doer. Any new hobby, particularly a technical one,
can be intimidating to newcomers. By keeping Ham Radio For Dummies handy
in your radio shack, getting your radio on the air and making contacts is easy.
I cover the basics of getting a station put together properly and the funda-
mentals of on-the-air behavior. Use this book as your personal radio buddy
and soon you’ll sound like a pro!
Conventions Used in This Book
To make the reading experience as clear and uncluttered as possible, I use a
consistent presentation style. Here are the conventions:
 Italics note a new or important term.
 Web site URLs (addresses) are indicated with a monospace font.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book I made some assumptions about you. You don’t have to
know a single thing about ham radio or its technology to enjoy Ham Radio
For Dummies. And you definitely don’t need to be an electrical engineer to
enjoy this book.
But I ask two things of you: You have an interest in ham radio and that you
know how to use a computer well enough to surf the Web. Due to the compli-
cated and extensive nature of ham radio, I couldn’t include everything in this
book (otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to lift it). However, I steer you in the
direction of additional resources to check out, including Web sites.
How This Book Is Organized
Ham Radio For Dummies has two major sections. Parts I and II are for readers
getting interested in ham radio and preparing to get a license. Parts III and 
IV explain how to set up a station, get on the air, and make contact with 
other hams.

The Ham Radio For Dummies Web site, at www.dummies.com/go/hamradio,
offers a list of Web resources and more information on the technical aspects
of this wonderful hobby.
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About?
If you don’t know much about ham radio, start reading this part. You get the
ham radio big picture. Then I send you on a tour of the various radio tech-
nologies necessary to get you on the air. I round out this first part with an
overview of the ham community: clubs and organizations.
Part II: Wading through 
the Licensing Process
The four chapters in Part II take you every step of the way through the process
of getting a ham radio license. I explain the overall licensing system, including
the types of licenses and the volunteers that administer the exams. Then I
move on to studying, including Morse code, for your exam. Finally, I discuss the
actual exam process so you know what to expect when the time comes. Part II
concludes with what to do after you pass your test.
Part III: Hamming It Up
The sky is the limit, but first you have to learn to fly. Part III is where you delve
into the fundamentals of ham radio operating. Then you get down to the brass
tacks of basic operation, including how to make that elusive first contact! I
cover the different kinds of casual operating and then get into some of the
popular specialties of the hobby, including public service and emergency
communications.
Part IV: Building and Operating 
a Station That Works
Part IV takes you through the basics of setting up and using a suitable sta-
tion. I cover the different kinds of ham radio equipment and how to acquire
what you need to get your station up and running. Ham radios take a little
maintenance and troubleshooting, and I devote a chapter to these topics.

What Is Ham Radio
All About?

In this part . . .
G
et ready to dive into the details of a terrific hobby
and service. In this part, you take a quick peek at
Ham Radio Land, formally known as the Amateur Radio
Service. I start by describing what ham radio is like 
today — you will be surprised at its breadth and technical
sophistication. You get a peek at the many ways in which
hams actually communicate and why. Then I show you
what most hams have in an actual radio shack.
Ham radio puts a technical face on many of its facets,
so you get a quick refresher or introduction to the tech-
nology of radio. Then I explain the basic gadgets of ham
radio, explain radio waves, and touch on how radio
depends on the natural environment.
You certainly don’t have to know everything about ham
radio by yourself because a lot of other hams are out
there to lend a hand. In fact, helping others is one of the
long-standing traditions of ham radio, so I show you how
to find a local club and join a ham radio organization: you
can find a large or small club, or one that caters to your
general interest and special purpose. They’re just what
you need to get in-depth knowledge about your own inter-
ests. You also get an introduction to hamfests and the
many ham radio gatherings. You are not alone!

H
am radio invokes a wide range of visions. Maybe you have a mental
image of a ham radio operator (or ham) from a movie or newspaper
article. But hams are a varied lot — from go-getter emergency communica-
tors to casual chatters to workshop tinkerers. Everyone has a place, and you
do, too.
Hams use all sorts of radios and antennas on a wide variety of frequencies to
communicate with other hams across town and around the world. They use
ham radio for personal enjoyment, for keeping in touch with friends and
family, for emergency communications, and for experimenting with radios
and radio equipment. They communicate using microphones, telegraph or
Morse keys, computers, cameras, lasers, and even their own satellites.
Hams meet on the air and in person. Ham radio clubs and organizations are
devoted to every conceivable purpose. They have special ham radio flea mar-
kets and host conventions, large and small. Hams as young as six years old
and centenarians have been hams since before ham radio licenses. Some
have a technical background, but most do not. One thing all these diverse
individuals do have, however, is an interest in radio that can express itself in
many different ways.

Tuning In Ham Radio Today
Hams enjoy three different aspects of ham radio — the technology, operating,
and social points of view. Your interest in the hobby may be technical; you may
want to use ham radio for a specific purpose; or you may just want to join the
fun. All are perfectly valid reasons for getting a ham radio license.
Using electronics and technology
Ham radio is full of electronics and technology (see Chapter 2). To start with,
transmitting and receiving radio signals is a very electronics-intensive endeavor.
After you open the hood on ham radio, you’re exposed to everything from
basic direct-current electronics to cutting-edge radio-frequency techniques.
Everything from analog electronics to the very latest in digital signal process-
ing and computing is available in ham radio. I’ve been in the hobby for more
than 30 years and I’ve never met anyone who is an expert on it all.
You may choose to design and build your own equipment or assemble a sta-
tion from factory-built components, just like an audiophile might do. All that
you need for either path is widely available in stores and on the Web. Hams
delight in a do-it-yourself ethic known as homebrewing and help each other
out to build and maintain their stations.
10
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 
Ham: Not just for sandwiches anymore
Everyone wants to know the meaning of the
word “ham,” but as with many slang words, the
origin is murky. Theories abound, of course,
ranging from the initials of an early radio club’s
operators to the use of a meat tin as a natural
sound amplifier. Out of the many possibilities,
this theory condensed from the American Radio
Relay League’s (ARRL) Web site seems the most
believable:
“Ham: a poor operator” was used in telegraphy
even before radio. The first wireless operators
were landline telegraphers who brought with
them their language and much of the tradition
of their older profession. Government stations,
ships, coastal stations, and the increasingly
numerous amateur operators all competed for
signal supremacy in each other’s receivers.
Many of the amateur stations were very pow-
erful and could effectively jam all the other
operators in the area. When this logjam hap-
pened, frustrated commercial operators would
send the message “THOSE HAMS ARE JAM-
MING YOU.” Amateurs, possibly unfamiliar with
the real meaning of the term, picked it up and
wore it with pride. As the years advanced, the
original meaning has completely disappeared.

Hams also develop their own software and use the Internet along with radios
to create novel hybrid systems. Hams developed packet radio by adapting
data transmission protocols used over computer networks to amateur radio
links. Packet radio is now widely used in many commercial applications. By
combining GPS radiolocation technology with the Web and amateur mobile
radios, the Automatic Position Reporting System (APRS) was developed and
is now widely used. More information about these neat systems is contained
in Parts III and IV.
Voice and Morse code communications are still the most popular technolo-
gies by which hams talk to each other, but computer-based digital operation
is gaining fast. The most common home station configuration today is a hybrid
of the computer and radio. Some of the newer radios are exploring software-
defined radio (SDR) technology that allows reconfiguration of the circuitry
that processes radio signals under software control.
Along with the equipment and computers, hams are students of antennas and
propagation, which is the means by which radio signals bounce around from
place to place. Hams take an interest in solar cycles, sunspots, and how they
affect the Earth’s ionosphere. For hams, weather takes on a whole new impor-
tance, generating static or fronts along which radio signals can sometimes
travel long distances. Antennas, with which signals are launched to take
advantage of all this propagation, provide a fertile universe for the station
builder and experimenter.
Antenna experimentation is a hotbed of activity for hams. New designs are
created every day and hams have contributed many advances and refinements
to the antenna designer’s art. Antenna systems range from small patches of
printed circuit board material to multiple towers festooned with large rotating
arrays. All you need is some wire, a feedline, and a soldering iron.
Hams also use radio technology in support of hobbies such as radio control
(R/C), model rocketry, and meteorology. Hams have special frequencies for
R/C operation in the 6-meter band, away from the crowded unlicensed R/C
frequencies. Miniature ham radio video transmitters are frequently flown in
model aircraft, rockets, and balloons, beaming back pictures from heights of
hundreds and thousands of feet. Ham radio data links are also used in support
of astronomy, aviation, auto racing and rallies, and many other pastimes.
Whatever part of electronic and computing technology you most enjoy, it’s all
used in ham radio somewhere . . . and sometimes all at once!

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Ham Radio

Operating a ham radio: Making contacts
If you were to tune a radio across the ham bands, what would you hear hams
doing? Contacts run the range from simple conversation to on-the-air meet-
ings to contesting (recording the highest number of contacts).
Ragchews
By far the most common type of activity for hams is just engaging in conver-
sation, which is called chewing the rag; such contacts are called ragchews.
Ragchews take place between continents or across town. You don’t have to
know another ham to have a great ragchew — ham radio is a very friendly
hobby with little class snobbery or distinctions. Just make contact and start
talking! Find out more about ragchews in Chapter 9.
Nets
Nets (an abbreviation for networks) are organized on-the-air meetings sched-
uled for hams with a similar interest or purpose. Some of the nets you can
find are
 Traffic nets: These are part of the North American system that moves
text messages or traffic via ham radio. Operators meet to exchange or
relay messages, sometimes handling dozens in a day. Messages range
from the mundane to emergency health-and-welfare.
 Emergency service nets: Most of the time, these nets just meet for train-
ing and practice. When disasters or other emergencies strike, hams orga-
nize around these nets and provide crucial communications into and out
of the stricken areas until normal links are restored.
 Technical Service: These nets are like radio call-in programs in which
stations call with specific questions or problems. The net control station
may help, but more frequently, one of the listening stations contributes
the answer. Many are designed specifically to assist new hams.
 ALE Mailboxes and Bulletin Boards: If you could listen to Internet sys-
tems make contact and exchange data, this is what they’d sound like.
Instead of transmitting 1s and 0s as voltages on wires, hams use tones.
ALE stands for Automatic Link Establishment and means that a computer
system is monitoring a frequency all the time so that others can connect
to it and send or retrieve messages. Sailors and other travelers use ham
radio where the Internet isn’t available.
 Swap Nets: In between the in-person hamfests and flea markets, in many
areas a weekly swap net allows hams to list items for sale or things they
need. A net control station moderates the process and business is gener-
ally conducted over the phone once the parties have been put in contact
with each other.
12
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

DX-ing, contests, and awards
DX stands for distance and the lure of making contacts ever-farther from home
has always been a part of ham radio. Hams compete to contact faraway sta-
tions and to log contacts with every country. They enjoy contacting islands
and making personal friends in a foreign country. When conditions are right
and the band is full of foreign accents, succumbing to the lure of DX is easy!
Ham radio’s version of rugby, contests are events in which the point is to make
as many contacts as possible, sometimes thousands, during the contest time
period, by sending and receiving short messages. These exchanges are related
to the purpose of the contest — to contact a specific area, use a certain band,
find a special station, or just contact everybody.
Along with contests, thousands of special-event stations and awards are
available for various operating accomplishments, such as contacting different
countries or states. For example, in December 2003, the station W4B was set
up at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and operated during the centennial of the
Wright Brothers’ first flight.
DX-ing, contests, and awards are closely related, and if you enjoy the thrill of
the chase, go to Chapter 11 to find out more about all of these activities.
Joining the ham radio community 
Because of their numbers and reliance on uncomplicated infrastructure,
hams are able to bounce back quickly when a natural disaster or other emer-
gency makes communications over normal channels impossible. Hams orga-
nize themselves into local and regional teams that practice responding to a
variety of emergency needs, working to support public safety agencies such
as police and fire departments.

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Ham Radio
It’s better than “masticating the towel”
Unlike “ham,” the origins of “ragchew” are
fairly clear. The phrase “chewing the rag” is well
known back to the late Middle Ages. “Chew”
was slang for “talk,” and “rag” is derived from
“fat,” or is a reference to the tongue. “Chew-
ing the rag” thus became a phrase referring to
conversation, frequently while sitting around a
meal. Hams picked up that usage from telegra-
phers, and because most of ham radio is, in fact,
conversations, it has been a part of radio from
its earliest days.

Is it hurricane season? Every fall in North America, ham emergency teams gear
up for these potentially devastating storms. Hams staff an amateur station at
the National Hurricane Center in Florida (www.fiu.edu/orgs/w4ehw/) and
keep the Hurricane Watch Net busy on 14.325 MHz (www.hwn.org/). After the
storm, hams are the first voices heard from the affected areas with many more
standing by to relay their messages and information.
After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, hams manned an emergency
operations center around the clock for weeks. Government agencies had to
focus on coordinating recovery and rescue efforts. The hams were able to
handle “health-and-welfare” messages to support the emergency workers in
their efforts.
Every June, on the last full weekend, hams across the United States engage in
an emergency operations exercise called Field Day. It’s an opportunity for hams
to operate under emergency conditions. An amateur emergency team or sta-
tion probably is operating in your town or county.
Hams provide assistance for more than emergencies. Wherever there is a
parade, festival, marathon, or other opportunity to provide communications
services, you may find ham radio operators helping out. In fact, this is great
training for emergencies!
A particularly beneficial relationship exists between ham radio and philately,
or stamp collecting. Hams routinely exchange postcards called QSLs with
their call signs, information about their stations, and often colorful graphics
or photos. Stamp collecting hams combine the exchange of QSLs with collect-
ing by sending the cards around the world with local colorful stamps or spe-
cial postmarks. Foreign hams return the favor with a stamp of their own. The
cheerful greeting of those red-and-blue airmail envelopes from an exotic loca-
tion is a special treat!
Hams like to meet in person as well as on the radio. Membership in at least
one radio club is a part of nearly every ham’s life. In fact, in some countries,
you’re required to be a member of a club before you can even get a license.
Chapter 3 shows you how to find and join clubs — they’re great sources of
information and assistance for new hams.
The two other popular ham gatherings are hamfests and conventions. A ham-
fest is a ham radio flea market where hams bring their electronic treasures
for sale or trade. Some are small, parking-lot-size get-togethers on a Saturday
morning while others attract thousands of hams from all over the world and
last for days. These are more like the conventions hams hold with a variety of
themes from public service to DX and low-power operating. Hams travel all
over the world to attend conventions and meet friends known only as a voice
and a call sign over the crackling radio waves.

Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

Roaming the World of Ham Radio
Although the United States has a large population of hams, it by no means rep-
resents the majority. The amateur population in Europe is growing by leaps
and bounds, and Japan has an even larger amateur population. With more
than 3 million hams worldwide, very few countries are without an amateur.
Hams are required to have a license, no matter where they operate. The inter-
national agency that manages radio activity is the International Telecommuni-
cation Union, or ITU (www.itu.int/home/). Each member country is required
to have its own government agency that controls licensing inside its borders. In
the United States, hams are part of the Amateur Radio Service, which is regu-
lated and licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Outside
the United States, Amateur Radio is governed by similar rules and regulations. 
Amateur Radio licenses in America are granted by the FCC, but the tests are
administered by other hams acting as volunteer examiners, or VEs. I discuss
VEs in detail in Chapter 4. Classes and testing programs are often available
through local clubs.
Since the adoption of international licensing regulations, hams operate from
many different countries with a minimum of paperwork. For example, a ham
from a country that is a party to the international license recognition agree-
ment known as CEPT can use his or her home license to operate from within
any other CEPT country. The ARRL has gathered a lot of useful material about
international operating on its Web site at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/
regulations/io.

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Ham Radio
Hams across the world
Where are the hams and how many are around
this big world? Over 3 million populate the ama-
teur bands, although not all are equally active.
As of 2000, the International Amateur Radio
Union (IARU) counted 195 different countries
with a national radio society. The growing coun-
tries of the Pacific Rim have substantial ama-
teur populations. Europe, Africa, and Russia
total 442,193. The Americas total nearly 1 million
with 830,492. Asia and the Pacific countries
have the most at 1,714,087. Amateur numbers
are showing moderate growth in North America
and strong growth in Asia and Europe. Tune the
bands on a busy weekend and you’ll see what I
mean!

Because radio signals know no boundaries, hams have always been in touch
across the political borders. Even during the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet hams
made regular contact, fostering long personal friendships and international
goodwill. While the Internet makes global communications easy, chatting by
voice or Morse code over the airwaves to someone in another country is
exciting.
Communicating with Ham Radio
Though you make contacts for different purposes — chatting, emergencies, a
net, or to win a contest — most contacts follow the same structure.
After you get a response from your call or respond to someone else calling,
you exchange names, information about who you are, and the quality of your
signal to gauge conditions. If you’re chatting, you can talk about how you
constructed your station, what you do for a living, your family, and your job.
Except for the fact that you take turns transmitting and information is con-
verted to radio waves that bounce off the upper atmosphere, contacts are just
like talking to someone that you meet at a party or convention. You can hold
the same conversation by voice, using Morse code, or typing from keyboard
to keyboard using computers as intermediaries to the radios. You won’t find
great purpose behind the average contact except a desire to meet another
ham and see where your radio signal can be heard.
A frequent question asked about ham radio is, “How do know where to tune for
a certain station?” and the answer is usually, “You don’t!” Ham radio operators
don’t have specific frequency assignments or use channel numbers. The good
news is that ham radio has an unparalleled flexibility to make and maintain
communications under continually changing circumstances. The bad news is
that making contact with one specific station is hard because you may not
know on what frequency to call them. However, hams have found many ways
around the latter problem with the result being an extraordinarily powerful and
adaptive communications service.
Building a Ham Radio Shack
The term radio shack, for me, conjures visions more worthy of a mad scien-
tist’s lab than a modern ham station. But your radio shack is simply the place
you keep your radio and ham equipment. The days of bulbous vacuum tubes,
jumping meters, and two-handed control knobs are in the distant past.
16
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

For some hams, the entire shack consists of a hand-held radio or two. Other
hams operate on the go in a vehicle. Cars make perfectly good shacks, but
most hams have a spot somewhere at home they claim for a ham radio.
Here’s what you can find in a ham shack:
 The rig: The offspring of the separate receiver and transmitter of yore, the
modern radio or rig combines both in a single, compact package about the
size of a large DVD player. Like its ancestors, a large tuning knob controls
the frequency. Unlike them, state-of-the-art digital displays replace the
dials and meters.
 Computer: A majority of hams today have at least one computer in the
shack. Computers now control many radio functions (including keeping
records). Using digital data communications simply wouldn’t be possi-
ble without one. Some hams use more than one computer at a time.
 Mobile/base rig: For operating on the local repeater stations, hams may
use a hand-held radio, but in the shack a more capable radio is used.
These units are about the size of a good-sized hardcover book and you
can use them as either a mobile or base rig.
 Microphones, keys, and headphones: Depending on the shack owner’s
preferences, you see a couple (or more!) of these important gadgets, the
radio’s true user interface. Mikes and keys range from imposing and
chrome-plated to miniaturized and hidden. The old Bakelite headphones
or cans are also a distant memory (good — they hurt my ears!), replaced
with lightweight and comfortable, hi-fi quality designs.
 Antennas: In the shack, you find switches and controllers for antennas
that live outside the shack. Outside, a ham shack tends to sprout anten-
nas ranging from vertical whips the size of a pencil to wire antennas
stretched through the trees and on up to super-sized directional beams
held high in the air on steel towers. See Chapter 12 for more info on
antennas.

Chapter 1: Getting Acquainted with Ham Radio
Shacks that aren’t Lakers
Where did the phrase, radio shack, come from?
Back in the early days of radio, the equipment
was highly experimental and all home-built,
requiring a nearby workshop. In addition, the
first transmitters used a noisy spark to generate
radio waves. The voltages were high and the
equipment somewhat of a mess, so the radio
hobbyists often found themselves banished from
the house proper. Thus, many early stations
were built in a garage or tool shed. The term
“shack” was only natural and carries through
today as a description of the state of order and
cleanliness found in many a ham’s lair.

 Cables and feedlines: Look behind, around, or under any piece of shack
equipment and you find wires. Lots of them. The radio signals pipe
through fat, black round cables called coaxial (coax). You’re probably
familiar with audio cables from stereo equipment. Power is supplied by
colored wires not terribly different in size from house wiring. I cover
cables and feedlines in more detail in Chapter 12.
Although you perform many of the same functions as the hams from the nine-
teenth century, the modern shack is as far removed from the home-brewed
breadboards in the backyard shed as a late model sedan is from a Model T. You
can see examples of several different shacks, including mine, in Chapter 13.

Getting a Handle on Ham 
Radio Technology
In This Chapter
 Calculating radio waves
 Stocking your shack with gadgets
 Understanding the effects of nature on ham radio
H
am radio covers a lot of technological territory. And to be successful in
ham radio, you need to have a general understanding of the technology
that makes up ham radio. In this chapter, I cover the most common terms
and ideas that form the foundation of ham radio.
Fundamentals of Radio Waves
Understanding ham radio (or any radio) is impossible without also having a
general understanding of the purpose of radio — to send and receive infor-
mation by using radio waves.
Radio waves are just another form of light and travel at the same speed: 186,000
miles per second. Radio waves can get to the moon and back in 21⁄2 seconds or
circle the Earth in 1⁄7 of a second.
An electric field and a magnetic field carry the energy of a radio wave. These
fields affect charged particles, such as the electrons in a wire, and make them
move. Electrons move in specific ways: They move parallel to electric fields
and in circular motions in response to magnetic fields. These moving electrons
(that is, current) also create moving electric and magnetic fields (in other words,
radio waves) and vice versa.

Transmitters cause electrons to move so that they, in turn, create the moving
fields of radio waves. Antennas are just structures for electrons to move in to
create radio waves. The electrons in an antenna also move in response to
radio waves launched by other antennas. Receivers then detect the electron
motion caused by the incoming radio waves. The energy is just transferred
from electrons to radio waves and back to electrons at the other station.
Frequency and wavelength
The radio wave-electron relationship has a wrinkle. The fields of the radio
wave aren’t just one strength all the time — they vary between a positive and
a negative value, or oscillate, like a vibrating string moves above and below
its stationary position. The time a field’s strength takes to go through one
complete set of values is called a cycle. The number of cycles in one second
is the frequency of the wave, measured in hertz (abbreviated Hz).
One other wrinkle — the wave is also moving at the speed of light, which is
constant. If you could watch the wave oscillate as it moved, you would see
that the wave always moves the same distance (one wavelength) in one cycle.
The higher the wave’s frequency, the quicker a cycle completes, and the less
time it has to move during one cycle. High frequency waves have short wave-
lengths and low frequency waves have long wavelengths.
If you know a radio wave’s frequency, you can figure out the wavelength
because the speed of light is always the same. Here’s how:
Wavelength = Speed of light / Frequency of the wave 
Wavelength in meters = 300,000,000 / Frequency in hertz
Similarly, if you know how far the wave moves in one cycle (the wavelength),
you also know how fast it oscillates because the speed of light is fixed.
Frequency in hertz = 300,000,000 / Wavelength in meters
Frequency is abbreviated as f, the speed of light as c, and wavelength as the
Greek letter lambda, λ, leading to the following simple equations:
f = c / λ and λ = c / f
Radio waves oscillate at frequencies between a few hundred kilohertz, or kHz
(kilo is the metric abbreviation meaning 1,000), up to 1,000 gigahertz, or GHz
(giga is the metric abbreviation meaning 1 billion). They have corresponding
wavelengths from hundreds of meters at the low frequencies to a fraction of a
millimeter (mm) at the high frequencies.
20
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

The most convenient two units to use in thinking of radio wave frequency
(RF) and wavelength are megahertz (MHz; mega means 1 million) and meters
(m). The equation describing the relationship is much simpler when you use
MHz and m:
f = 300 / λ in m and λ = 300 / f in MHz
If you are not comfortable with memorizing equations, an easy way to convert
frequency and wavelength is to memorize just one combination: for example,
300 MHz and 1 meter or 10 meters and 30 MHz. Then use factors of ten to move
in either direction, making frequency larger and wavelength smaller as you go.
The radio spectrum
The range, or spectrum, of radio waves covers a lot. Tuning a radio receiver 
to different frequencies, you hear radio waves carrying all kinds of different
information. These frequencies are called signals and are grouped by the type
of information they carry into different ranges of frequencies, called bands.
For example, AM broadcast band stations are at frequencies between 550 and
1700 kHz (550,000 and 1,700,000 hertz or 0.55 and 1.7 MHz). Bands help you
find the signals, without having to hunt over a wide range.
The different users of the radio spectrum are called services, such as the broad-
casting service or Amateur Radio Service. Each service gets a certain amount
of spectrum to use, called a frequency allocation. Amateur Radio, or ham radio,
has quite a number of allocations sprinkled throughout the radio spectrum. I
get into the exact locations for the ham radio bands in Chapter 8.
Radio waves at different frequencies act differently in the way they travel and
require different techniques to transmit and receive. Because waves of simi-
lar frequencies tend to have similar properties, the radio spectrum is divided
into four segments:
 Shortwave or High-Frequency (HF): Frequencies below 30 MHz.
Includes AM broadcasting, ten different ham radio bands, ship-to-shore
and ship-to-ship, military, and Citizens Band.
 Very High Frequency (VHF): Frequencies from 30 to 300 MHz. Includes
TV channels 2 through 13, FM broadcasting, three ham bands, public
safety and commercial mobile radio, and military.
 Ultra High Frequency (UHF): Frequencies from 300 MHz to 1 GHz.
Includes TV channels 14 and higher, two ham bands, cellular phones,
public safety and commercial mobile radio, and military.
 Microwave: Frequencies above 1 GHz. Includes GPS, digital wireless tele-
phones, WiFi wireless networking, microwave ovens, eight ham bands,
satellite TV, and numerous public, private, and military users.
21
Chapter 2: Getting a Handle on Ham Radio Technology

Because a radio wave has a specific frequency and wavelength, hams use the
terms somewhat interchangeably. For instance, the 40-meter and 7 MHz ham
bands are the same thing. Check out Chapter 8 for the specifics on the ham
bands. I will use both in this book so that you become used to interchanging
them as hams are expected to do.
Basic Ham Radio Gadgetry
Although the occasional vacuum tube radio may still be found glowing in an
antiques-loving ham’s station, today’s ham radios are sleek, microprocessor-
controlled communications centers. The basic radio is composed of a receiver
combined with a transmitter to make a transceiver, called a rig by hams. Mobile
and handheld radios are called rigs, too. If the rig doesn’t use AC line power,
use a power supply to provide the DC voltage and current. Figure 2-1 shows a
typical basic station’s components and gadgets.
The radio is connected with a feedline to one or more antennas. Two of the most
popular are shown in Figure 2-1: A dipole is an antenna made from wire and con-
nected to its feedline in the middle. A beam antenna sends and receives radio
waves better in one direction than others and is often mounted on a tall pole or
tower with a rotator that can point it in different directions. Antenna switches
allow the operator to select one of several antennas. An antenna tuner is used
between the antenna/feedline combination and the transmitter, like a vehicle’s
transmission, in order for the transmitter to operate at peak efficiency.
You use headphones and a microphone to communicate using the various
methods of transmitting speech. If Morse code (or CW) is preferred, you can
use the traditional straight key (an old-fashioned Morse code transmission
device), but more commonly you use a paddle and keyer. A paddle and keyer
are much faster than straight keys and require less effort to use. The paddle
looks like a pair of straight keys mounted back to back on their sides. The
keyer converts the closing and opening of each paddle lever into strings of
dots and dashes.
If you use digital data for contacts, a computer or other device is required to
interpret and generate the on-the-air signal. In this case, disconnect the micro-
phone (and probably headphones) and replace them with connections to the
external equipment, as shown in Figure 2-2. A data interface passes signals
between the radio and computer. For some types of data, a computer can’t do
necessary processing, so a multi-protocol controller is used. The computer talks
to the controller using its serial RS-232 (COM) port.
22
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

Many radios also have an RS-232 interface that allows a computer to control
the radio directly. You can find a lot of programs that allow you to change fre-
quency and many other radio settings from the keyboard. Computers can
also send and receive Morse code, marrying the hottest twenty-first-century
technology with the oldest form of electronic communications!

Feedline measurements
Most radios and antenna tuners have the ability to evaluate the electrical
conditions inside the feedline, measured as the standing wave ratio (SWR).
SWR is a ratio of voltages and tells you how much of the power supplied by
the transmitter is getting radiated by the antenna. Most radios have a built-in
meter that shows feedline SWR. Having a stand-alone SWR sensor, called an
SWR meter or an SWR bridge, to measure SWR is very handy when working on
antennas or operating in a portable situation. You can also measure feedline
conditions by using a power meter, which measures the actual power flowing
back and forth. SWR meters are inexpensive, while power meters are more
accurate. These devices are typically used right at the transmitter output.
Filters
Filters are designed to pass or reject ranges of frequencies. Some filters are
designed to pass or reject only specific frequencies. Filters can be made of
inductors and capacitors, called discrete components, or even from sections
of feedline, called stubs. Filters come in the following varieties:
Transceiver
Audio to
and from
radio
Audio to and
from sound card
Multi-Protocol
Controller (MPC)

Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

 Feedline: Use feedline filters to prevent unwanted signals from getting to
the radio from the antenna or vice versa. On transmitted signals, you can
use them to ensure that unwanted signals from the transmitter are not
radiated, causing interference to others. They also prevent undesired sig-
nals from getting to the receiver where they may compromise receiver
performance.
 Receiving: Receiving filters are installed inside the radio and are usu-
ally made from quartz crystals or from small tuning-fork-like structures.
Receiving filters remove all but a single desired signal in a receiver. Filters
improve a receiver’s selectivity, which refers to its ability to receive the
single signal in the presence of many signals.
 Audio: Use audio filters on the receiver output to provide additional fil-
tering capability, rejecting nearby signals or unwanted noise.
 Notch: A notch filter works to remove a very narrow range of frequen-
cies, such as a single interfering tone.
Feedlines
Two common types of electrical feedlines connect the antennas to the station
and carry RF energy between pieces of equipment. The most common is coax-
ial cable, or just coax, so named because it is constructed of a hollow tube sur-
rounding a central wire concentrically. The outer conductor is called the shield
and also braid, if made from fine woven wire. The wire in the middle is called
the center conductor and is surrounded by insulation that holds it right in the
center of the cable. The outer conductor is covered by a plastic coating called
the jacket. The other kind of feedline is open-wire, also called twin-lead or ladder
line, which is made from two parallel wires. The wires may be exposed, only
held together with insulating spacers, or plastic insulation may cover them.
Ham Radio on the Air
Aside from the equipment, ham radio technology also extends to making con-
tacts and exchanging information. You use the following technologies when
using your ham radio:
 Modulation/Demodulation: Modulation is the process of adding informa-
tion to a radio signal to transmit over the air. Demodulation is the process
of recovering information from a received signal. Ham radios use two
kinds of modulation: amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modula-
tion (FM).
 Modes: Modes are specific types of modulation. You can choose from
several modes when transmitting, some of which include voice, data,
video, or Morse code.
25
Chapter 2: Getting a Handle on Ham Radio Technology

 Repeaters: Repeaters are relay stations that listen on one frequency and
retransmit what they hear on a different frequency. Because they are
often located on tall buildings, towers, or hilltops, they enable hams to
use low-power radios to converse over many miles. They can be linked
together either by radio or the Internet to extend communication around
the world. Repeaters can listen and transmit at the same time, which is
called duplex operation.
 Satellites: Yes, just like the military and commercial services, hams use
satellites. Some amateur satellites act as “repeaters in the sky,” while
others are used as orbiting digital bulletin boards and e-mail servers.
 Computer software: Computers have become a big part of ham radio.
Initially, they were limited to doing paperwork and making calculations
in the shack. Today, they also act as part of the radio, generating and
decoding digital data signals, sending Morse code, and controlling the
radio’s functions. Hams also have constructed radio-linked computer
networks and a worldwide system of e-mail servers accessed by radio.
Hams have always been interested in pushing the envelope in applying and
developing radio technology — which is one of the fundamental reasons that
ham radio exists as a licensed service. Today, that includes creating novel
hybrids of radio and other technologies, such as the Internet and GPS radio
location. For example, the ARRL High Speed Multimedia Working Group is
working to adapt wireless LAN technology to ham radio. The Tucson Amateur
Packet Radio (TAPR) organization has many members around the world devel-
oping new methods of digital communication. You also find ham radio to 
be a hotbed of innovation in antenna design and construction. Ham radio is
“techie heaven!”
Dealing with Mother Nature
Because radio waves travel through the natural environment on their way to
space or to another terrestrial station, its phenomena affect them. Thus hams
take a keen interest in propagation.
For local contacts, the radio wave journey along the surface of the Earth is
called ground wave propagation. Ground wave propagation can support com-
munication up to 100 miles, but varies greatly with the frequency being used.
To make longer range contacts, the radio waves must travel through the atmos-
phere. At HF and sometimes at VHF, the upper layers of the atmosphere, called
the ionosphere, reflect the waves back to Earth. The reflection of radio waves is
26
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

called sky wave propagation. Depending on the angle at which the signal is
reflected, a sky wave path can be as long as 2,000 miles. HF signals often
bounce between the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere several times so that
contacts are made worldwide. At VHF, multiple hops are rare but use other
reflecting mechanisms.
Apart from the ionosphere, the atmosphere itself can direct radio waves.
Tropospheric propagation, or just tropo, occurs along weather fronts, tempera-
ture inversions, and other large-scale phenomena in the atmosphere. Tropo is
common at VHF and UHF frequencies, often supporting contacts over 1,000
miles or more.
27
Chapter 2: Getting a Handle on Ham Radio Technology
Ham radios, CB radios, and cellular phones
Radios abound — enough to boggle your mind.
Here are the differences between your ham
radio and those other radios:
 Citizens Band (CB): CB radio uses 40 chan-
nels near the 28 MHz ham band. CB radios
are low-power and useful for local commu-
nications only, although the radio waves
sometimes travel long distances. You don’t
need a license to operate a CB radio. This
lightly-regulated service is plagued by ille-
gal operation that diminishes its usefulness.
 Family Radio Service (FRS) and General
Mobile Radio Service (GMRS): These popu-
lar radios, such as the Motorola Walkabout
models, are designed for short-range com-
munications between family members.
Usually hand-held, both types operate with
low-power on UHF frequencies. FRS opera-
tion is unlicensed, but the higher-power,
more capable GMRS radios do require a
license.
 Broadcasting: Although hams are often
said to be “broadcasting,” this term is
incorrect. Hams are barred from doing any
one-way broadcasting of programs the way
AM, FM, and TV stations do. Broadcasting
without the appropriate license attracts a
lot of attention from a certain government
agency whose initials are FCC.
 Public safety and commercial mobile radio:
The hand-held and mobile radios used by
police, firemen, construction workers, and
delivery companies are similar in many ways
to VHF and UHF ham radios. In fact, the fre-
quency allocations are so similar that hams
often convert surplus equipment. Commer-
cial and public safety radios require a
license to operate. 
 Cellular and digital wireless telephones:
Obviously, you don’t need a license to use a
wireless phone, but you can only communi-
cate through a licensed service provider on
one of the wireless phone allocations. The
older, analog phones operate between 800
and 900 MHz, while the newer digital phones
operate near 2 GHz. While the phones are
actually little UHF and microwave radios,
except for a few models, they can’t commu-
nicate directly with each other and are com-
pletely dependent on the wireless phone
network to operate.

Two other VHF- and UHF-reflecting features exist in our atmosphere: the aurora
and meteor trails. When the aurora is strong, it absorbs HF signals, but reflects
VHF and UHF signals adding a characteristic rasp or buzz. Hams active on
those bands know to point their antennas north to see if the aurora can sup-
port an unusual contact. Meteor trails are very hot from the friction of the
meteor’s passage through the atmosphere. So hot, that the gasses become
electrically conductive and reflect signals until they cool. For a few seconds,
a radio mirror floats high above the Earth’s surface. Meteor showers are a
popular time to try the meteor scatter mode.

Finding Other Hams: 
Your Support Group
In This Chapter
 Joining a club
 Becoming a member of the ARRL
 Finding a specialty organization
 Checking out online communities
 Going to hamfests and conventions
A
n Elmer, or mentor (see Chapter 5), is very useful in helping you over the
rough spots every newcomer encounters. As your interests widen, though,
you’ll need additional help. Luckily, hundreds and hundreds of potential Elmers
are in the myriad ham radio clubs and organizations around the world.
One of the oldest traditions of ham radio is helping the newcomer, and hams
are great at providing a little guidance or assistance. You can make your first
forays into ham radio operating much easier and more successful by taking
advantage of those helping hands. This chapter shows you how to find them.
Radio Clubs
The easiest way to get in touch with other hams is through the local radio club.
Radio clubs have been around as long as radio. The first clubs were just groups
of like-minded experimenters who collaborated to build radios when the tech-
nology was raw and success by no means assured. Over time, the club grew in
size and importance. Today, clubs range from small, focused groups to large
clubs, with wide-ranging interests.

The following points hold true for most hams:
 Most hams belong to at least one club, sometimes several: Belonging to
a general interest club as well as one or two specialty groups is popular.
 Most local or regional clubs have in-person meetings: Membership is
drawn largely from a single area.
 Specialty clubs are focused on activities: Activities such as contesting,
low-power operating, or amateur television, may have a much wider
(even international) membership. See the “Specialty Organizations and
Clubs” section, later in this chapter, to discover different specialty clubs.
 Individual chapters may have no in-person meetings: They may con-
duct meetings only over the air.
Clubs are great resources for assistance and mentorship. As you get started
in ham radio, you’ll find that you need a lot of basic questions answered. I
recommend that you start by joining a general interest club (see the upcom-
ing section). If you can find one that emphasizes assistance to the new ham,
so much the better. You’ll find the road to enjoying ham radio a lot smoother
in the company of others.
Finding and choosing a club
To find ham radio clubs in your area, start at www.qrz.com/clubs.html and
select your state to find a list of the state’s radio club Web sites. The American
Radio Relay League (ARRL) also has a directory of affiliated clubs on its Web
site at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/club/clubsearch.phtml. Enter your
state, city, or zip code to locate nearby clubs.
Focus on the general interest clubs and look for the clubs that offer help to new
hams. For example, I found this listing for one of the largest Seattle, Washing-
ton, clubs through the ARRL Web site:
Name: MIKE & KEY AMATEUR RADIO CLUB
Specialties: General Interest
Call sign: K7LED
Services: Help for newcomers, entry-level classes, higher-level classes,
other
This club is well suited for a new ham. You find yourself in the company of
others recently licensed, so you won’t feel self-conscious when asking ques-
tions. You have programs and activities to learn from and opportunities for
you to contribute.
30
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

If you have more than one club available in your area, how do you make a
choice? Consider these points when making a decision:
 Which club has meetings that are more convenient for you?
Check out the meeting times and places for each club.
 Which club includes activities or programs that include your interests?
If a club has a Web site or newsletter, review the past few month’s activi-
ties and programs to see if they sound interesting.
 Which club feels more comfortable to you?
Don’t be afraid to attend a meeting or two to find out what the club is like.
You’ll quickly find out that the problem is not finding clubs, but in choosing
among the hundreds of them! Unless the club has a strong personal participa-
tion aspect, such as a public service club, you can join as many as you want
just to find out about that part of ham radio. Most clubs have a newsletter
and a Web site that give you a valuable window into one of ham radio’s many
specialties.
Participating in a club
After you pick a general interest club, show up for meetings, and make a few
friends right away, how do you really start participating? Do ham radio clubs
have a secret protocol? What if you goof up?
Obviously, you won’t start your ham club career by running for president at
your second meeting, but ham clubs are pretty much like every other hobby
group. As such, you can become an insider with easy first steps. You’re the
new guy or gal, which means you have to show you want to belong. Here are
some tips to help you assimilate:
 Show up early and help set up, make the coffee, hang the club banner, help
figure out the projector, and so forth. Stay late and help clean up, too.
 Be sure to sign in, sign on, or sign up if you have an opportunity to do
so, especially if it’s your first meeting.
 Wear a name tag or other identification that announces your name and
call sign in easy-to-read letters.
 Introduce yourself to whomever you sit next to.
 Introduce yourself to a club officer as a visitor or new member. If a “stand
up and identify yourself” routine occurs at the beginning of the meeting,
be sure to identify yourself as a new member or visitor. If other people
also identify themselves as new, go introduce yourself to them later.
31
Chapter 3: Finding Other Hams: Your Support Group

 After you’ve been to two or three meetings, you will probably recognize
some of the club’s committees or activities. If one of them sounds inter-
esting, introduce yourself to whoever spoke about it and offer to help.
 Show up at club activities or work parties!
 Comb your hair. Brush your teeth. Sit up straight. Wear matching socks.
Yes, Mom.
These magic tips are not just for ham radio clubs, but also for just about any
club. And just like those other clubs, ham clubs have their own personality.
They vary from wildly welcoming to tightly knit, seemingly impenetrable
groups. Though after you break the ice, hams seem to bond for life. And
when you’re a club elder, remember to extend a hand to new members the
way you appreciated when you were a new face yourself!
Getting involved
Okay, you’re a regular! How can you get involved? In just about every ham
club, you’ll find the following jobs need doing. Find out who is currently in
that position and offer your help. You’ll discover a new aspect of ham radio,
gain a friend, and make a contribution.
 Field days: Planners and organizers can always use a hand in getting
ready for this June operating event. Offer to help with generators, tents,
and food, and find out about the rest of it as you go. Helping out with
field days is a great way to meet the most active members of the club.
 Conventions or hamfests: If the club hosts a regular event, almost any
kind of help is always needed. If you have any kind of organizational or
management expertise, so much the better.
 Awards and club insignia: Managing sales of club insignia is a great job
for new members — keeping records, taking orders, and making sales at
club meetings. If you have an artistic or crafts bent, don’t be afraid to
make suggestions.
 Libraries and equipment: Many clubs maintain a library of reference
books or have equipment that is loaned to members. All you have to do
is keep track of it and make it available to other members.
 Club stations: If your club is fortunate enough to have its own radio shack
or repeater station, some maintenance work — such as working on
antennas, changing batteries, tuning and testing radios, or just cleaning —
always needs to be done. Buddy up with the station manager; you can
become familiar with the equipment very quickly. You need not be techni-
cal, just willing.
32
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

If you can write or design Web sites, don’t hesitate to volunteer your services
to the club newsletter editor or Webmaster. Chances are that they have sev-
eral projects backlogged and would be delighted to have your help.
Along with the ongoing club committees and business, you usually can find a
number of club-sponsored activities. Some clubs are organized around one
major activity while others seem to have one or two going on every month.
Here are a few common club activities:
 Public service: This activity usually entails providing local communica-
tion during a sporting or civic event, such as a parade or festival. These
events are great ways for you to hone your exchanging messages and
operating skills.
 Contests and challenges: Operating events are great fun and many clubs
enter on-the-air contests as a team or club. Sometimes, clubs challenge
each other to see which can generate the most points. You can either get
on the air yourself or join a multi-operator station.
 Work parties: What’s a club for if not to help out its own members? Rais-
ing a tower or doing antenna work with other members is a great way to
meet active hams and discover this important aspect of station building.
 Construction projects: Building your own equipment and antennas is a lot
of fun, so clubs may occasionally sponsor group construction projects.
Building your own equipment saves money and lets everyone work
together to solve problems. If you like building things or have technical
skills, here’s a great way to help out.
Supporting your club by participating in activities and committees is impor-
tant. For one thing, you can acknowledge the help you get from the other
members. You also start to become a mentor (or Elmer) yourself to other new
members. (See Chapter 5 for more on Elmers.) By being active within the
club, you strengthen the organization, your friendships with others, and the
hobby in general.
The ARRL
The American Radio Relay League (ARRL) is the oldest continuously function-
ing amateur radio organization in the world. Founded before World War I, the
ARRL provides services to hams around the world and plays a key part in rep-
resenting the ham radio cause to the public and governments. That ham radio
could survive for nearly 100 years without a strong leadership organization is
hard to imagine and the ARRL has filled that role.
33
Chapter 3: Finding Other Hams: Your Support Group

I am devoting a separate section of this chapter to the ARRL simply because
it is such a large presence within the hobby to U.S. hams (and with its sister
organization, Radio Amateurs of Canada or RAC, to Canadian hams) and
because of the many valuable services it provides, particularly to new hams.
ARRL’s benefits to you
The most visible benefit of ARRL membership is that you receive QST maga-
zine every month. QST, the largest and oldest ham radio magazine (shown in
Figure 3-1), includes feature articles on both technical and operating topics;
reports on regulatory information affecting the hobby; the results of ARRL-
sponsored competitions; and numerous columns covering a wide variety of
topics. All the largest ham radio equipment manufacturers advertise in QST
as well. Other excellent ham radio magazines exist, but QST is the most widely
read and important.
Along with the print magazine, the ARRL also maintains an active and sub-
stantial Web site at www.arrl.org. You can find the following features on the
Web site:
 News and general interest stories posted every day
 The Technical Information Service, an extensive reference service, includ-
ing technical document searches with numerous articles available online
 An active ham-radio swap and shop, open 24 hours a day
 A number of free e-mail bulletins and newsletters

The ARRL Field Organization coordinates the activities of hundreds of volun-
teers. While the League has a paid staff at its headquarters in Newington,
Connecticut, the ARRL is by and large a volunteer organization. These volun-
teers are organized into 80 different sections in 15 divisions.
The Field Organization also includes the world’s most extensive non-
governmental radio network, the National Traffic System (NTS). The NTS is
key in rapidly responding to all sorts of emergencies and is active on a daily
basis, passing radio messages, or traffic, all over the world.
Along with administrative and organizational functions, the ARRL is also the
largest single sponsor of operating activities for hams. The ARRL sponsors
numerous competitive events, called contests, award programs, and technical
and emergency exercises.
ARRL’s benefits to the hobby
By far the most visible aspect of the ARRL on the ham bands is the ARRL head-
quarters station, W1AW. Carrying the original call sign of ARRL founder Hiram
Percy Maxim, the powerful station (shown in Figure 3-2) is a worldwide beacon,
beaming bulletins and Morse code practice sessions to hams around the planet
every day. Visiting hams can also operate the W1AW station themselves (don’t
forget your license!). Most hams think being at the controls of one of the most
famous and storied ham stations in all the world is the thrill of a lifetime!

Chapter 3: Finding Other Hams: Your Support Group

The ARRL also provides the Volunteer Examiner Coordinator (VEC) service
(you may have taken your licensing test during an ARRL-VEC session). With
the largest number of volunteer examiners, the ARRL-VEC assists thousands
of new and active hams take their licensing exams, obtain vanity and spe-
cial call signs, renew their licenses, and update their license information of
record. When the FCC could no longer maintain the staff to administer licens-
ing programs, the ARRL and other ham organizations stepped forward to
create the largely self-regulated VEC programs instrumental to today’s healthy
ham radio.
The least visible of its functions is the representation of the Amateur Radio
service to governments and regulatory bodies — arguably one of the most
important functions of the ARRL. Radio spectrum is prime territory in the
telecommunications-driven world and many other services would like to get
access to amateur frequencies, regardless of the long-term impact. The ARRL
also serves as a trusted voice to the FCC and Congress, helping regulators
and legislators understand the special nature and needs of the Amateur
Service.
ARRL’s benefits to the public
Although naturally focused on its membership, the ARRL takes seriously its mis-
sion to support Amateur Radio. The ARRL Web site is largely open to the public
as are all bulletins broadcast by W1AW. The ARRL performs these services:
 Facilitates the development of emergency communications: In conjunc-
tion with the Field Organization, the Amateur Radio Emergency Service
(ARES) teams around the country provide thousands upon thousands of
hours of public service every year. While individual amateurs render
valuable aid in times of emergency, the organization of these efforts mul-
tiplies its usefulness.
 Publishes the ARRL Handbook: Now in its 81st edition, the handbook is
an acknowledged telecommunications industry reference, used by profes-
sionals as well as amateurs. The League publishes numerous technical
references and guides, including conference proceedings and standards,
furthering the state of the radio art.
 Promotes not only ham radio, but also technical awareness, with strong
support programs for elementary through secondary schools: The
League is also involved with the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts Radio merit
badge and Jamboree On-The-Air programs. For hams, the ARRL spon-
sors a growing series of Web-based continuing education courses.

Specialty Organizations and Clubs
Ham radio is big, wide, and deep. The hobby has many individual communities
that fill the airwaves with diverse activities. A specialty club or organization
focuses on one aspect of ham radio that emphasizes certain technologies or
types of operation. Quite a number of specialty organizations have a worldwide
membership, as well.
To find specialty clubs, search the Internet by entering your area of interest
and the word club. For example, entering 10 meter club at www.google.com
turns up nearly a dozen ham clubs or forums.
Some clubs focus on particular operating interests, such as qualifying for
awards or operating on a single band. An example of the latter is the 10-10
International Club (www.ten-ten.org/), which is for operators that prefer
the 10 meter band, a favorite of low-power and mobile stations. The 10-10
Club sponsors several contests every year and offers a set of awards for con-
tacting its members. The Six Meter International Radio Klub (SMIRK) promotes
activity on the 6 meter band with its special and unusual methods of signal
propagation. The club’s contests and awards are listed at www.smirk.org/.
Another type of specialty club is the contest club. Members enjoy participating
in competitive on-the-air events known as radiosports, or simply contests (the
topic of Chapter 11). The clubs challenge each other, sponsor awards and
plaques, and generally encourage members to build up stations and techniques
to become top contest operators. Contest clubs tend to be local or regional
due to the rules of club competition. One of the oldest U.S. clubs, the Yankee
Clipper Contest Club, maintains a list of U.S. contest clubs at www.yccc.org/
Links/Contest_clubs.htm. You can view an extensive list of clubs that
compete in ARRL contests at www.arrl.org/contests/club-list.html,
although many general interest clubs are included. For contest clubs around
the world, try the list at www.ac6v.com/clubs.htm#DX.
No less competitive than contest operators are the long-distance communica-
tions specialists, or DXers, who specialize in long-distance contacts with places
well off the beaten track. The quest to work ’em all (contact every country on

Joining the ARRL
The ARRL is a volunteer-based, membership-
oriented organization. Just like your local club,
if the ARRL is to provide you with useful services
and effectively represent your interests, you
need to be a member. Better yet, the League
needs you to be a volunteer! Rest assured, even
as a new ham, you can make a meaningful con-
tribution as a volunteer. To find out how to join,

every ham band) lasts a lifetime and leads you to learn obscure geography
when a ham begins transmitting from a tiny island somewhere far away. DXers
form clubs to share operating experiences and host traveling hams, fostering
international communications and goodwill along the way. I belong to the
Western Washington DX Club (www.wwdxc.org) with members worldwide,
although most of them are near Seattle, Washington.
Because of an international nature, DX clubs tend to have members sprinkled
around the globe. If one is in your area, you can find it at www.dailydx.com/
clubs.htm.
Handi-Hams
Ham radio provides excellent communication opportunities to people who
otherwise find themselves constrained by physical limitations. Handi-Hams,
founded in 1967, is a specialty organization dedicated to providing tools that
make ham radio accessible to hams with disabilities of all sorts. Handi-Hams
helps those people turn disabilities into assets through ham radio.
Handi-Hams not only helps hams with disabilities reach out to the rest of the
world, but also helps its members link up with other members and to various
helpful services. Even if you’re not disabled, Handi-Hams may be a welcome
referral to someone you know or you may want to volunteer your services to
Handi-Hams. The Handi-Hams Web portal provides links to an extensive set of
resources at www.handihams.org.
AMSAT
AMSAT (short for Amateur Radio) is the international organization that helps
coordinate satellite launches and oversees the construction of its own satel-
lites. Radio operation through a satellite is a lot easier than you may think, as
you can find out in Part IV.
Yes, Virginia, there really are Amateur Radio satellites up there whizzing through
the heavens! The first one, launched in 1962, sent a Morse code beacon consist-
ing of the letters “HI” (in Morse code speak, “di-di-di-dit, di-dit”), known as the
telegrapher’s laugh. Nowadays, more than 20 satellites are in orbit. The first,
OSCAR-1 (Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio), was about the size of a
large coffee can. Modern satellites, such as the AO-40 shown in Figure 3-3, are
full-sized and full-featured. The satellite pictured provides communications on
several amateur UHF and microwave bands.
You can find the AMSAT Web site at www.amsat.org. The list of links at the
bottom of the page is where you find information on the organization and
membership.

TAPR
Another acronym, TAPR stands for Tucson Amateur Packet Radio (www.tapr.
org), which has been a force in digital communications development for
more than 20 years. TAPR has been instrumental in bringing modern digital
communications technology to ham radio. In return, TAPR members created
several innovative communication technologies that are now commonplace
beyond ham radio, such as the communications system known as packet radio,
which is widely used in industry and public safety. More recently, TAPR mem-
bers have been instrumental in implementing modern digital communications,
such as networking and spread-spectrum technology, as shown in Figure 3-4. If
you have a strong computer background, TAPR is likely to have activities that
pique your interest.
Young Ladies’ Radio League — the YLRL
The YLRL (Young Ladies’ Radio League) was founded in 1939 and is dedicated
to promoting ham radio to women, encouraging YL (young lady) activity on the
air, promoting women’s interests within the hobby, and providing an organiza-
tion for female hams.

Chapter 3: Finding Other Hams: Your Support Group

YLRL is an international organization with chapters in many countries, hosting
conventions and creating opportunities for travel. The YLRL’s home page at
www.ylrl.org provides a list of activities and member services. The YLRL has
a vigorous award program and also sponsors on-the-air nets for members. It
also sponsors on-the-air competitions for YLs and OMs (Old Men, or, in other
words, male operators of any age).
QRP clubs: ARCI, AmQRP, and G-QRP
QRP is ham radio shorthand for low power operating, using just a few watts of
power to span the oceans. Like bicyclists among the motorists, QRP enthusi-
asts emphasize skill and technique, preferring to communicate with a minimum
amount of power. The largest U.S. QRP clubs are the QRP Amateur Radio Club
International, known as QRP ARCI (www.qrparci.org/), and the American
QRP Club, or AmQRP (www.a-qrp.org/). Both have excellent magazines,
such as the QRP Quarterly seen in Figure 3-5, full of construction projects and
operating tips.

Many QRP clubs are worldwide, and one of my favorites is the British club, 
G-QRP (G is the prefix of call signs in England). You find the G-QRP home page
at www.gqrp.com/. If you like building your own gear and operating with a
minimum of power, check out these clubs and other groups of QRPers.
Online Communities
Just like every other human activity, ham radio has online communities in
which members discuss the various aspects of the hobby. They provide
resources and support, available 24 hours a day. Will these communities
replace ham radio? Not likely; the magic of radio is just too strong. By their
presence, though, they make ham radio stronger by cementing relationships
and adding structure.

Reflectors
The first online communities for hams were e-mail lists, known as reflectors.
Reflectors are mailing lists that take e-mail from one mailbox and re-broadcast
it to all members. With some list memberships numbering in the thousands,
reflectors get information spread around pretty rapidly. Every ham radio
interest has a reflector.
Table 3-1 presents a number of the larger Web sites that act as hosts for
reflectors. You can browse the directories and decide which list suits your
interests. Be careful you don’t wind up spending all your time on the reflec-
tors and none on the air!

The new ham may want to join one of the Elmer e-mail lists that are set up
specifically to answer questions and offer help. To find general and topical
Elmer lists, enter ham radio elmer reflector into a Web search engine and
you can turn up several candidates.
Because my main interests are QRP operating on the HF bands, contesting,
and making long-distance or DX contacts, I subscribe to the QRP reflector, the
CQ-Contest reflector, a couple of the DX reflectors, and the Top Band reflec-
tor about 160-meter operating techniques and antennas. To make things a
little easier on my e-mail box, I subscribe in digest form, which means I get
one or two bundles of e-mail every day instead of many messages. Most
reflectors are lightly moderated and usually close the list to any posts not
from subscribed members, or in other words, spam.
42
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

The reflectors at Yahoo! Groups (groups.yahoo.com/) offer a little more than
just e-mail distribution. They also offer file storage, a photo display function,
chat rooms, polls, and excellent member management. To take advantage of
these services, you must create a personal Yahoo! profile first. More than 500
ham radio groups on Yahoo!Groups are in the Hobbies section. Some are open
to the public and others require you to subscribe to the list. Log onto Yahoo!
Groups and enter ham radio in the search engine to find them.
As soon as you settle into an on-the-air routine, subscribe to one or two
reflectors. Reflectors are also a great way to find out about new equipment
and techniques before you take the plunge and try them yourself.
Newsgroups
The USENET newsgroups encompass a stunning breadth of human interests,
including ham radio. After you subscribe to a newsgroup, you can make any
kind of post; the topics of discussions are wide-ranging.
You have the ability to subscribe to these newsgroups through most e-mail pro-
grams. Some services also manage newsgroup information, such as Google
Groups (groups.google.com/). You can find ham radio topics in both the alt
(eight topics) and rec (two topics) lists and have hundreds of messages every
day. One popular example is the rec.ham-radio.swap group, which is a ham
radio flea market that runs 24/7.
Newsgroups are generally unmoderated and open, so they tend to have a higher
amount of spam and off-topic discussions than the moderated reflectors.
Nevertheless, you can find a lot of excellent information in the newsgroups.
Portals
More than a reflector or meeting site, portals provide a comprehensive set of
services and function as a ham radio home page. They feature news, informa-
tive articles, radio buy-and-sell pages, links to databases, reflectors, and many
other useful services to hams. The best-known portals are eHam.net (www.
eham.net) and QRZ.com (www.qrz.com).
QRZ (the ham radio abbreviation for “Who is calling me?”) evolved from a call
sign lookup service — what used to be a printed book known as a callbook —
to the comprehensive site that you see today. The callbook features are incredi-
bly useful and a number of call sign management functions are on the site. Ham
radio news is the main forum on the home page, but Q&A forums and equip-
ment exchanges are also on the portal.
43
Chapter 3: Finding Other Hams: Your Support Group

The eHam.net site evolved from a specialty Web site known as Contesting.
com, which focused on ham radio competitions (now encompassed within
the eHam.net site). The eHam home page is organized around community
functions, operating functions, and resources. You can find real-time links to
a DX-station spotting system (frequencies of distant stations currently on the
air) and the latest solar and ionospheric data that affect radio propagation.
I recommend that you bookmark both of these sites because they have a
lively collection of news and articles along with useful forums and features.
Both are gateways to e-mail reflectors that make subscription easy.
Hamfests and Conventions
Depending on how much you like collecting and bargaining, I may have saved
the best for last. Ah, the hamfest! Hamfests are one of the most interesting
events in ham radio. Imagine an Oriental bazaar crammed with technological
artifacts spanning nearly a century, old with new, small with massive, tubes,
transistors, computers, antennas, batteries . . . I’m worn out just thinking about
it! I love a good hamfest; can you tell?
Hamfests are ham radio flea markets. The primary sellers are individuals
vending treasures from a folding table or a tailgate. You may even find some
commercial vendors. Some hamfests are very small and last only a few hours,
while a few attract thousands over several days. Hamfests may be held indoors
or outdoors.
A ham radio convention has a much broader slate of activities than a hamfest;
it may include seminars, speakers, licensing test sessions, and commercial
vendors. Conventions often include a swap meet along with the rest of the
functions. Conventions often have a theme, such as emergency operations,
QRP or low-power operating, or digital radio transmissions, to name a few.
Finding hamfests
In the United States, the best place you can find hamfests at is the ARRL Web
site (www.arrl.org). At the top of the home page is a Hamfests link, which
takes you to the Hamfest and Conventions page. Search for events by state,
ARRL section, or ARRL division. Over 100 hamfests are usually listed at all
times. Another good source of information is your ARRL Section News (look
for the ARRL Sections link at the top right of the ARRL home page) or club
newsletter. Most populated areas have several good-sized hamfests every
year, even in the dead of winter.
44
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

After you have a hamfest in your sights, set your alarm for early Saturday
morning (most are Saturday-only events) and get ready to be there at the
opening bell. Be sure to bring the following things:
 An admission ticket: You need a ticket, sold at the gate or by advance
order through a Web site or e-mail.
 Money: Take cash, because most vendors do not take checks or credit
cards.
 Something to carry your purchases in: Take along a sturdy cloth sack,
backpack, or other bag that can tolerate somewhat grimy, dusty elec-
tronic devices.
 A hand-held or mobile rig: Most hamfests have a talk-in frequency,
which is almost always a VHF or UHF repeater. If you’re unfamiliar with
the area, you can get directions while en route.
If you go with a friend and both of you take hand-held radios, you can
share tips about the stuff you find while walking the aisles.
 Water and food: Don’t count on food being available, but the larger ham-
fests almost always have a hamburger stand. Rarely is gourmet food on
hand, but expect the same level of quality as that of the concession stands
at a ballgame. Taking along a full water bottle is a good idea.
Buying at hamfests
After parking, waiting, and shuffling along in line, you finally make it inside
the gates. You’re ready to bargain! All hamfests are different, but here are
some guidelines to live by, particularly as a novice hamfest customer:
 If you’re new to ham radio, buddy up with a more experienced ham to
steer you around hamfest pitfalls.
 Most prices are negotiable; more so after lunch, but a good deal goes
quickly. Most vendors are not interested in trades, but you do no harm
by offering.
 Hamfests are good places to buy accessories for your radio, often selling
for a fraction of the manufacturer’s price if separate from the radio.
Commercial vendors of new batteries often have good deals on spare
battery packs.
 Many hamfests now have electricity available so that vendors can demon-
strate equipment. If a vendor refuses to demonstrate a supposedly func-
tional piece of gear, or won’t open up a piece of equipment for inspection,
you may want to move along.
45
Chapter 3: Finding Other Hams: Your Support Group

 Unless you really know what you are doing, avoid antique radios. They
often have quirks that can make using them a pain or require impossible-
to-get repair parts.
 Be familiar with the smell of burnt or overheated electronics, especially
transformers and sealed components. Direct replacements may be diffi-
cult to obtain.
 Don’t be afraid to ask what something is. Most of the time, the ham behind
the table enjoys telling you and, even if you don’t buy it, the discussion
may attract a buyer.
 If you know exactly what you are looking for, check the auction Web sites
and radio swap sites, such as www.eham.net, www.qrz.com, and www.
arrl.org/RadiosOnline/, before you attend the hamfest. You can get
an idea of the going price and average condition, so you’re less likely to
get gouged.
Other activities at hamfests
Along with buying and selling, many hamfests also have programs and speak-
ers and even license exam sessions, like small conventions. Look for a flyer
or check the hamfest Web site for information about special services that
may be available.
Finding conventions
You can find out about upcoming conventions in the same places as hamfests.
Conventions tend to be more extravagant affairs than hamfests and may be
advertised in ham radio magazines as well as online. At a convention, the main
focus is on programs, speakers, and socializing. Conventions are usually held
in a hotel.
The two largest ham radio conventions of all are the Hamvention, held in
Dayton, Ohio, in mid-May, and the International Amateurfunk-Ausstellung,
held in Friedrichshafen, Germany, in late June. Dayton regularly draws 25,000
or more and Friedrichshafen nearly that many. Both have mammoth flea mar-
kets, an astounding array of programs, internationally-known speakers, and
you can’t possibly see all of it. If at all possible, you should go to one of them
at least once in your life!
The ARRL National and Division Conventions (listed on the ARRL Web site) are
held in every region of the United States. The Radio Amateurs of Canada also
host a national convention every year. These conventions typically attract a
few hundred to a few thousand and are designed to be family friendly. They
46
Part I: What Is Ham Radio All About? 

also provide a venue for specialty groups to host conferences within the over-
all event. These smaller conferences are where you find extensive programs
on direction finding, QRP, county hunting, wireless networking on ham bands,
and so on.
Some conventions and conferences emphasize one of ham radio’s many facets,
such as DX-ing, VHF and UHF operating, or digital technology. If you are a fan of
a certain mode or activity, treating yourself to a weekend convention is a great
way to meet some of the other hams that share your tastes and discover more
about your interests. Table 3-2 lists a few of the specialty conventions held
around the United States each year.

In this part . . .
G
etting a license from (drum roll, please) the Federal
Government (trumpet flourish) sounds daunting, but
getting a license has never been easier. In fact, you don’t
even have to deal with a government agency until your
license shows up in the mail! Ham volunteers do all the
licensing work — teaching, testing, and filing paperwork.
If you can fill out the application for a driver’s license, you
can get a ham radio license.
In this part, you find out all about how hams get their
licenses. Odds are you’ll need an Elmer to guide you along
the way, of course, and I introduce you to Elmer here.
I explain just how the test is conducted, how to study for
it, and how to sign up for a test session. After you pass
(naturally!) I spill the beans about how to find out what
your new call sign is. You can even pick out your own call
sign if you want!

U
nlike some of the other types of radios available to the public, ham
radios can only be used with a license. But how do you get a license?
How much does it cost? Can you obtain different kinds of licenses? Like most
people, you’re probably familiar with the process of getting a license to drive
your car, to fish, or to get married. Ham radio licensing is a little different, but
easy to deal with once you know how it works.
Amateur Radio is one of many different types of radio services that use the
radio waves to communicate. Other services include Broadcast (AM, FM,
TV), Public Safety (police and fire departments), Aviation, and even Radar.
To maintain order on the airwaves, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) requires that each station be licensed. Stations in all the different ser-
vices must abide by the regulations created by the FCC in order to obtain and
keep their licenses, which give them permission to transmit according to the
rules for that service. That’s what a ham license is — authority for you to
transmit on the frequencies that licensees of the Amateur Radio Service are
permitted to use. This chapter explains the FCC’s licensing system for
Amateur Radio in the United States.
The Amateur Service: An Overview
By international treaty, the Amateur Service in every country is a licensed
service. That is, a government agency has to approve the application of

every ham to transmit. Although regulation seems a little quaint given all of
the communications gadgets for sale these days, licensing is necessary for
a couple of reasons:
 It allows amateurs to communicate internationally and directly, without
using any kind of intermediate system that regulates their activities.
 Because of the power and scope of Amateur Radio, hams need a mini-
mum amount of technical and regulatory background so they can co-
exist with other radio services, such as broadcasting.
By maintaining the quality of licensees, licensing helps ensure that the
Amateur Service makes the best use of its unique citizen access to the air-
waves. Amateur Service sets ham radio apart from the unlicensed services
and is recognized in the FCC rules as the Basis and Purpose of the Amateur
Radio Service, rule 97.1:
 Recognition of ham radio’s exceptional capability to provide emergency
communications (rule 97.1(a))
 Promote the amateur’s proven ability to advance the state of the radio
art (rule 97.1(b))
 Encourage amateurs to improve their technical and communications
skills (rule 97.1(c))
 Expand the number of trained operators, technicians, and electronics
experts (rule 97.1(d))
 Promote the amateur’s unique ability to enhance international goodwill
(rule 97.1(e))
Pretty heady stuff, eh? Ham radio does all these good things in exchange for
radio space among the commercial and government users. You can find all
the rules for Amateur Radio at wireless.fcc.gov/rules.html (click the
Part 97 link for the Amateur Radio rules). Plain English discussion of the rules
is available on the ARRL Web site at www.remote.arrl.org/FandES/field/
regulations/rules-regs.html or in the ARRL’s FCC Rule Book.
Frequency allocations
To keep order in the growing radio communications field, countries got
together in 1932 and formed the International Telecommunication Union
(www.itu.int/home/), based in Geneva, Switzerland. The ITU is not part of
any government, but is a forum for deciding and recording the rules of radio
spectrum usage. The ITU divided the spectrum into small ranges in which
52
Part II: Wading through the Licensing Process 

specific types of uses occur (see Figure 4-1). These ranges are called
frequency allocations.
The world is divided into three regions, as follows:
 Region 1: Europe, Russia, and Africa
 Region 2: North and South America
 Region 3: Asia, Australia, and most of the Pacific
Within each region, each type of radio service — amateur, military, commer-
cial, and government — is allocated a share of the available frequencies.
Luckily for amateurs, most of their allocations are the same in all three
regions. Figure 4-2 shows the HF range frequencies (from 3 to 30 MHz). This
allocation is very important, particularly on the long-distance bands where
radio signals might propagate all the way around Earth. Talking to someone
in a foreign country is pretty difficult if you don’t use the same frequency! 
To get an idea of the complexity of the allocations, browse to the Region 2
allocation chart at www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/allochrt.html. (If you
have Adobe Acrobat you can download the entire color chart.) The individual
colors represent different types of radio services. Each service has a small
slice of the spectrum, including amateurs. Can you find the Amateur Service
on the chart? Hint: It’s green.

Chapter 4: Figuring Out the Licensing System

Amateurs have small allocations at numerous places in the radio spectrum and
access to those frequencies depends on the type of license class you possess.
The higher class license that you have, the more frequencies you can use!
Becoming Licensed: Individual
License Classes
By taking progressively more challenging exams, more frequencies and oper-
ating privileges become available to the ham, as shown in Table 4-1. After you
pass a specific test level, called an element, you have permanent credit for it.
This system allows you to progress at your own pace. Your license is good
for a ten-year period and you can renew it without taking an exam.
The ARRL and other organizations publish study guides and manuals. Some
may be available through your local library. (Be sure they are the latest ver-
sion, because the test questions change from time to time.) Online tests are
available with the actual questions that are on the test. By taking advantage
of these materials, you’ll have confidence that you’re ready to pass the exam
on test day.

Amateur Extra.

The Amateur Radio service is undergoing some restructuring as I’m writing

change. Be sure that you have the current version of study materials that
reflect the correct rules and regulations.
Technician class
Nearly every ham starts with a Technician-class license, also known as a Tech
license. The Technician licensee is allowed access to all 17 ham bands with
frequencies of 50 MHz or higher. These privileges include operation at the
maximum legal limit and all types of communications. Tech licensees, on the
other hand, may not transmit on the bands below 30 MHz.
The test for this license consists of 35 multiple-choice questions on regula-
tions and technical radio topics. You have to get 26 or more correct to pass.
If you pass a 5-word-per-minute (wpm) Morse code exam, you also receive
some transmitting privileges in segments of four of the traditional shortwave
HF bands, as shown in Table 4-2. You can take the Morse code exam at the
same test session as the written exam or at a later date if you like.

Chapter 4: Figuring Out the Licensing System

Morse code is required for amateur operation below 30 MHz because of an
international treaty adopted many years ago. At that time, a great deal of
commercial and military radio traffic — news, telegrams, ship-to-ship, and
ship-to-shore messages — was conducted using the code. Back then, using
Morse code was considered a standard radio skill. This part of the treaty
was recently dropped, and Morse code may yet lose its place in amateur
licensing. Nevertheless, Morse code still makes up a great deal of amateur
operations — from casual ragchewing, to passing messages, contests, and
emergency operations. Its efficient use of transmitted power and spectrum
space, as well as its innate musicality and rhythm, make it very popular
with hams.
General class
By passing the 5-wpm Morse code exam and another 35-question written exam,
the doors of Amateur Radio are flung wide open. General class licensees have
full privileges on nearly all amateur frequencies with only small portions of
some HF bands off limits. The General class exam covers many of the same
topics as the Technician exam, but in more detail. Some new topics a more
experienced ham is expected to understand are on the General class exam.
After starting with the entry-level Technician license, most hams today
upgrade to the General class. When you obtain a General class license, you’ve
reached a great milestone. All of the important frequencies on the HF bands
are available to General class licensees.
Amateur Extra class
General class licensees still can’t access everything; the lower segments of
several HF bands are for Extra class licensees only. These segments are
where the expert operators hang out. These segments are prime operating
territory. If you become interested in contesting, contacting rare foreign sta-
tions (DX-ing), or just having access to these choice frequencies, you want
to get your Amateur Extra license, the top level of all license classes.
The Amateur Extra exam consists of 50 multiple-choice questions, 37 of which
you must answer correctly to pass. The exam covers additional rules and reg-
ulations associated with sophisticated operating and several advanced techni-
cal topics. Hams that pass the Amateur Extra exam consider it a real feather in
their caps. Do you think you can climb to the top rung of the licensing ladder?

Part II: Wading through the Licensing Process 

Grandfathered classes
The Amateur Radio Service licensing rules have changed in the past 15 years
to reduce the number of license classes. Hams that hold those licenses in
deleted classes may renew those licenses indefinitely, but no new licenses for
those classes are being issued. Three “grandfathered” license classes exist:
 Novice: The Novice license was introduced in 1951 with a simple 20-
question test and 5-wpm code exam. A General class (or higher ham)
administered the exam. Originally, the license was good only for a single
year, at which point the Novice upgraded or left the air. These days, the
Novice license, like other licenses today, has a ten-year term and is
renewable. Novices are restricted to segments of the 3.5, 7, 21, and 28
MHz amateur bands.
 Technician-Plus: These licensees are just the same as the current
Technician licenses that passed the 5-wpm code test. The only differ-
ence is that a separate formal license class no longer exists.
 Advanced Class: Advanced Class licensees passed an exam midway in
difficulty between those for the General and Amateur Extra classes and
received frequency privileges beyond those for a General, but not as
extensive as an Amateur Extra.

Chapter 4: Figuring Out the Licensing System

Understanding Call Signs
Along with your license comes a very special thing — your call sign (or call
to hams), which becomes your on-the-air identity. Each license granted by
the FCC receives a unique call sign. Most hams change call signs once or
twice before settling on one. Sometimes, your call sign starts taking over your
off-the-air identity, too, as you become “Ward, NØAX” with your call sign in
place of a last name. I have ham friends for whom I really have to think hard
to remember their last name! Each letter and number in a call sign is pro-
nounced individually and not as a word, for example “N Zero A X,” not 
“No-axe.”
Hams use the Ø symbol to represent the number zero, a tradition from com-
mercial operating practices.
Ham radio call signs around the world are constructed from two parts: the
prefix and the suffix. The suffix of a call sign, when added to the prefix, posi-
tively identifies you. Each call sign is unique. A lot of call signs consist of
NØ and AX, but only one call sign is NØAX.
The prefix is composed of one or two letters and one numeral. For instance,
the prefix in my call sign is NØ. It also identifies the country that issues your
license and may also specify where you live within that country. For U.S. call
signs, the numeral indicates the call district of your license when it was issued.
Mine was issued in St. Louis, Missouri, which is part of the tenth or zero dis-
trict. Suffixes consist of one to three letters. (No punctuation characters are
allowed, just A to Z and Ø to 9.) The suffix in my call sign is AX.
The ITU assigns each country a block of prefix character groups that allows
the government to assign licenses in all of its radio services. U.S. licensees
(not just hams) all have call signs that begin with the letters A, K, N, or W.
Even broadcast stations have call signs such as KGO or WLS. Most Canadian
call signs begin with VE. English call signs may begin with G or M. Germans
use D (for Deutschland), call signs that begin with J are Japanese, and so on.
You can find the complete list of ham radio prefix assignments at www.ac6v.
com/prefixes.htm#PRI.
Whatever class license you have is reflected in your call sign. When you get
your first license, the FCC assigns you the next call sign in the heap for your
license class — in much the same way you’re assigned a license plate at the
DMV. But, also like license plates, you can request special vanity call signs,
within the call sign rules, of course. The higher your license class, the shorter
and more distinctive your chosen call sign can be! Turn to Chapter 7 for more
information on how to find out your call sign.
58
Part II: Wading through the Licensing Process 

Your call sign is both a certification that you have personally passed the
licensing exam and permission to construct and operate a station — a very
special privilege.
The Volunteer Licensing System
While the processing of commercial and military license applications is han-
dled directly by the FCC, it no longer administers Amateur Radio licensing
examinations. In the United States, ham radio license exams are given by vol-
unteer examiners who are certified by a coordinating organization: the VEC.
This system is typical of the ham tradition of self-policing and self-organizing.
The quality of the examination process is quite high. The flexibility provided
by an all-volunteer system makes taking the test easy for the test-taker as
well as the test-giver. The volunteers handle all of the paperwork and even
file the results with the FCC. The actual license is still granted by the FCC,
however.
In the Olde Days, tests were taken at the “local” FCC office, which could be
hundreds of miles away. I vividly remember making long drives to the govern-
ment office building to take my exams with dozens of other hams. Nowadays,
the tests are usually available a short drive away at a club, school, or even in
private homes. As a volunteer examiner, I’ve given over 30 exams around my
kitchen table for hams as young as 10 years old!
Volunteer Examiner Coordinator (VEC)
The Volunteer Examiner Coordinator (VEC) is the organization that takes
responsibility for coordinating the volunteer examiners who run the exam
sessions and it also processes all of the FCC-required paperwork. The VEC
with the most volunteer examiners is the nationwide group run by the
American Radio Relay League (ARRL-VEC), but 13 other VECs are located
around the United States. You can find a VEC near you at wireless.fcc.
gov/services/amateur/licensing/vecs.html. Some VECs, such as the
ARRL-VEC and W5YI-VEC, operate nationwide, while others work in only
a single region.
The VEC is responsible for preparing and administering the license exams
and other materials. It collects the test results, resolves all discrepancies,
and then files all of the data with the FCC electronically. This process gets
you your license and call sign much faster than if handled by the FCC. New
licensees know their call signs within seven to ten business days from the
time they take the test!
59
Chapter 4: Figuring Out the Licensing System

The VECs maintain a list of volunteer examiners (VEs), upcoming test ses-
sions, and other resources for the ham test-taker. The VECs also deal with
more than just exams — they can help you renew your license and change
your address or name.
Volunteer Examiners (VEs)
The volunteer examiners make the system run. Each exam requires that three
VEs are present and all three sign off on the test paperwork. VEs are respon-
sible for all aspects of the testing process, including the meeting space and
announcing the test sessions.
Any licensed amateur can become a VE by contacting one of the VEC organi-
zations and completing whatever qualification process the VEC requires. In
the case of the ARRL-VEC, a booklet on the volunteer licensing system is pro-
vided and the VE applicant must pass a short exam.
VEs are authorized to administer or proctor license exams at the same or
lower class of license they hold themselves. For example, a General class
VE can administer Technician and General exams, but not Amateur Extra.
How much does the exam cost? Under the ARRL-VEC, the current cost of
attending a test session and taking an exam for any of the licensing elements
is $12. If the volunteers incur any expenses, such as for supplies or renting
the facility for testing, they’re allowed to keep up to $6 per person (some
choose to keep none of the fee). The remainder goes to the VEC to cover its
expenses.
VEs are amateurs just like you (or just like you will be) and do a real service
to the amateur community by making the licensing system run smoothly and
efficiently. Don’t forget to say, “Thanks!” at the conclusion of your test ses-
sion, pass or fail. Better yet, become a VE yourself!

Studying for Your License
In This Chapter
 Breaking down the test
 Finding study resources
 Getting help from a tutor
 Dealing with Morse code
You’ve decided to take the plunge and get your ham radio license! Con-
gratulations! While you can’t just run down to the store, buy your gear,
and fire it up, becoming licensed is not a terribly difficult process. You can
use a lot of resources as you prepare yourself for the ham radio exam. This
chapter gives you some pointers on how best to make those preparations so
that you enjoy studying and do well at test time.
If you buddy up with a study partner, studying is much easier. Having a part-
ner helps you both stick with it! You each find different things to be easy and
difficult, so you can work together to get through the sticky spots. Best of all,
you can celebrate passing the test together!
Demystifying the Test
In order to do the best job of studying, you need to understand just what the
test consists of and how it’s designed. The tests for all license classes are multi-
ple choice. You won’t find any essay or pictorial questions. No oral questions
of any kind are on the test either — no one asks you to recite the standard pho-
netic alphabet or sing a song about Ohm’s Law.
The test for each license class (except Morse code) is called an element. The
5-words-per-minute Morse code exam, Element 1, tests your ability to receive
Morse code. The written exam for the Technician license is Element 2. The
written exams for General and Amateur Extra licenses are Elements 3 and 4,
respectively.

During your studies, you’ll encounter questions from the question pool, which
is a large set of actual questions used on the test, all available to the public.
The exam that you take is made up of a random selection of questions from
that pool.
Well, the selection isn’t quite random. The test covers four basic areas:
 Rules & Regulations: Important rules of the road that you have to know
to operate legally
 Operating: Basic procedures and conventions hams follow on the air
 Basic Electronics: Elementary concepts about radio waves and electron-
ics with some very basic math involved
 RF Safety: Questions about how to operate and install transmitters and
antennas safely
The exam has a certain number of questions from each area; these questions
are randomly selected from these areas. The Technician and General tests
have 35 questions, while the Amateur Extra test has 50. If you answer three-
quarters of the questions correctly, you pass!
Because the exam questions are public, you’ll experience a strong temptation
to just memorize the questions. Don’t! Take the time to understand as much of
the material as you can. When you do get your license, you’ll find that studying
pays off.
To be sure, memorization is required for a couple of areas, such as the lists of
permitted frequencies for each license class. You have to know the exact limits
of your license privileges before you can start operating.
Finding Resources for Study
If you’re ready to start studying, what do you study? Are there books to study?
Videos? Help! Lucky for you, the aspiring ham, numerous study references fit
every taste and capability. Study aids commonly include classes, books, soft-
ware, video, and online help.
Before purchasing any study materials, be aware that the test questions and
regulations change infrequently, but they do change. The latest change was to
the Technician class questions on July 1, 2003. Be sure that any study materials
you purchase include the latest updates. The ARRL Web site shows the dates of
the current question pools at www.remote.arrl.org/arrlvec/pools.html.
62
Part II: Wading through the Licensing Process 

Finding licensing classes
If you learn better with a group of other students, you’ll find classes benefi-
cial. You can find classes by:
 Asking at your radio club. You can take classes sponsored by the club.
If you don’t see the class you want, contact the club by e-mail and ask
about classes. If you need to find a club in your area, turn to Chapter 3.
 Looking for upcoming exams to be held in your area. The ARRL Web
site has a search engine devoted to upcoming exams at www.arrl.org/
arrlvec/examsearch.phtml, as does the W5YI test coordinator Web
site (www.w5yi.org).
Get in touch with the exam’s contact liaison and ask about licensing tests.
Because tests are often given at the end of class sessions, these contacts
are frequently class instructors themselves!
 Asking at a ham radio or electronics store. If a ham radio store is in
your vicinity (look in the Yellow Pages under “Electronic Equipment &
Supplies” or “Radio Communication Equipment & Systems”), usually an
associated bulletin board or Web site lists upcoming classes.
Businesses that sell electronic supplies to individuals, such as Radio-
Shack, may also know of classes. In a pinch, you can do a Web search for
ham radio class or radio licensing class (or close variations) plus your
town or region.
Other options for finding classes include local disaster-preparedness organiza-
tions, schools and colleges, which often provide space for classes, and public
safety agencies such as the police and fire departments. By asking around you
can usually turn up a reference to someone involved with ham radio licensing.
Occasionally you see classes advertised that take you from interested party
to successful exam taker in a single weekend! The Technician exam is simple
enough that a focused, concerted effort over a couple of days can cram
enough material into your brain for you to pass the test.
The good part about these sessions is that by committing a single weekend,
you can walk out the door on Sunday night having passed your exam and find
your new call sign in the FCC’s database the following week. For busy folks or
those in a hurry, this time savings is a tremendous incentive.
Remember when you crammed for a final exam overnight and the minute after
you took the exam you forgot everything that was on it? The same phenome-
non applies to the licensing test as well. A lot of information you memorize in
such a short amount of time can fade quickly over time. In two days, you can’t
really absorb the material well enough to permanently understand it. Unlike
63
Chapter 5: Studying for Your License

high school geometry, you use everything on the test later in real life. That
means you have to really learn it, if not now, then again later. If you have the
time to take a weekly course, that’s the better choice.
Books, software, and videos
Of the available licensing study guide books, the best known guide is the ARRL’s
Now You’re Talking! Aimed at the person studying for a Technician exam, it goes
well beyond presenting just the questions from the question pool; Now You’re
Talking! attempts to really teach the why and how of the material. The ARRL
books are available via www.arrl.org and from numerous retail outlets.
Gordon West WB6NOA has also written a series of licensing guides for all three
license classes. These focus tightly on the pool in a question-and-answer
format and are geared to the student who wants to pass the test quickly, so a
lot of the background present in the ARRL’s book is omitted. Gordon’s books
are sold through various retail outlets such as RadioShack.
In video format, the most detailed packages are the ARRL’s Technician Class
and General Class series of tapes. Each package is professionally prepared and
has three tapes with a study guide. The companion video to the license study
guide by Gordon West is the “No Code Video Seminar.” CQ Magazine (www.cq-
amateur-radio.com) offers an inexpensive series of Getting Started In videos
that cover various aspects of ham radio. Basic Technology for the Amateur
Radio Enthusiast by Alpha Delta Communications is another introductory video
seminar that helps explain some of the technology involved with radio.
In software, one of the better series is the Ham University CDs, which includes
a Technician licensing course and a Morse code disc. Several of the avail-
able courses have been converted from books to software packages by the
same name.
Figure 5-1 shows some of these resources.
Online
Online resources are numerous, although generally not as thorough as the
book and video courses. Nevertheless, the online practice exams can be partic-
ularly useful. When tutoring students, I urge them to practice the online exams
repeatedly. Because the online exams use the actual questions, it’s almost like
the real thing. Practicing with them reduces your nervousness and gets you
used to the actual format.
64
Part II: Wading through the Licensing Process 

The sites score your exams and let you know which of the study areas need
more work. When you can pass the online exams by a comfortable margin
every time, you’ll do well in the actual session. You can find online exams at
 www.aa9pw.com/radio/
 www.qrz.com
 www.eham.net
While you’re using the online tests, avoid the temptation to just take them
over and over until you memorize them. Use the online tests as a way to test
your understanding and to become familiar with the test format.
Finding a Mentor
Studying for your license may take you on a journey into unfamiliar territory.
You can easily get stuck at some point — either on a technical concept or
maybe a confusing regulation.

Chapter 5: Studying for Your License

As in many similar situations, the best way to solve a problem is to call on a
more experienced person who can help you over the rough spots. In ham
radio, these friendly mentors are called Elmers.
Rick Lindquist N1RL traces the history of the term Elmer — meaning someone
who provides personal guidance and assistance to would-be hams — to QST
magazine in a March 1971 “How’s DX” column by Rod Newkirk W9BRD. Elmer
didn’t refer to anyone specific; just the friendly, more experienced ham who
was around to help someone get their license and then get on the air. Nearly
every ham has an Elmer at some point.
You won’t get far by putting out a personal ad, but a lot of potential Elmers
are out in Ham Radio Land. You can find Elmers in the following places:
 A ham radio licensing class: Often sponsored by a local ham radio club,
a class is well worth whatever nominal fee, if any, charged just for the
personal instruction you get and the ability to ask questions.
 Radio clubs: Radio clubs can help you find classes or may even host
them. Clubs welcome visitors and often have an introduction session
during the meeting. This session gives visitors an opportunity to say,
“Hi, my name is so-and-so. I don’t have a license yet, but I’m studying
and might need some help.” Chances are, you’ll get several offers of
assistance and referrals to local experts or classes. (Find out more about
clubs in Chapter 3.)
 Online: You can ask questions and help others in their studies on
numerous online sites. Teen Hams at www.youthtech.com/hamradio/
is popular. You can also find a good general-focus chat room at www.
qsl.net/n5sdd/.

Part II: Wading through the Licensing Process 
My Elmer experience
When I started in ham radio, my Elmer was Bill
WNØDYV (now KJ7PC), a fellow high-school
student who had been licensed for a year or so.
I wasn’t having any trouble with the electronics,
but I sure needed a hand with the Morse code
and frequency listings. I spent every Thursday
over at Bill’s house practicing Morse code
(pounding brass) and learning to recognize my
personal nemesis characters: D, U, G, and W.
Without Bill’s help, my path to getting licensed
would have been considerably longer. Thanks,
Bill! Since getting my license, I’ve required the
assistance of several other Elmers as I entered
new aspects of ham radio. If you can count on
the help of an Elmer, the road to a license is
much smoother.

 In your community: Many of today’s hams find their Elmers by looking
around their own neighborhoods. Maybe a ham with a tower and
antenna lives near you, or you see a car with a ham radio license plate at
work. If you get the opportunity, introduce yourself and explain that
you’re studying for a license. Chances are that the person you’re talking
to needed an Elmer himself, way back when, and can give you a hand or
help you find one.
After you get your license, you’re in an excellent position to help other new-
comers because you know just exactly how they felt at the start of the jour-
ney. Even if you’re just one step ahead of the person asking the questions,
you can be an Elmer. Some hams enjoy Elmer-ing so much that they devote
much of their ham radio time to the job. You won’t find a higher compliment
in ham radio than “My Elmer.”
Mastering Morse Code
Mastering Morse code is a very personal thing, such as playing an instrument
or achieving a new athletic maneuver. Many people liken it to studying another
language, with the same sudden breakthroughs separated by periods of repeti-
tion. Becoming a skilled Morse code operator results in a great sense of accom-
plishment, and you’ll never regret it.
If you decide to study Morse code, some methods are much better than others.
Avoid any method that encourages you to think of a table of character pat-
terns. Managing the required 5 words per minute while looking up each char-
acter in your mind is difficult. After you can receive code as fast as these
methods permit, you’ll find moving to the higher speeds that make Morse
code fun hard.
The style that most hams are successful with is the Farnsworth Method. The
dits and dahs of each character are sent at the code speed (words per minute)
you want to achieve, but the individual characters are spaced far enough apart
in time (character spacing) so that the overall word speed is low enough for
you to process the character’s sound pattern. For the beginner, a common
sending speed for individual characters is 7 words per minute (wpm), while the
character spacing results in a much lower overall speed for the words.
By sending the characters at the higher speed, you keep from falling into the
look-it-up-in-the-table trap. Thinking of the code as a table of letters in one
column and a dot-dash pattern in another is a natural tendency. When you
67
Chapter 5: Studying for Your License

hear a sequence of code elements (the dots and dashes), such as short-long-
long, you then look it up in your head to find the character “W.” This method
works, but only up to speeds of a few words per minute and it’s a very hard
habit to break.
The Farnsworth method gets you thinking “didahdah” instead of “dot dash
dash.” The former is closer to the actual sound of the character. You then mem-
orize the character as the entire pattern of sounds and not as disconnected ele-
ments. This method keeps you from having to unlearn the table method and
makes progressing to higher speeds easy. Make sure whatever study aid you
choose uses the Farnsworth Method or something similar, such as ARRL and
Gordon West Morse code study tapes and books or the Ham University and
Morse Academy software. (Go to www.ac6v.com/morseprograms.htm for an
encyclopedic listing of Morse code training aids.)
The graph in Figure 5-2 shows the normal progression in code speed. Between
each step, or plateau, you achieve a new skill. While on the plateau, you refine
or solidify the skill. Over time, you can progress from copying letter-by-letter
to hearing whole groups of characters and then words.
A great way to gauge your Morse code proficiency is with live code practice,
which helps freshen up your taped or computer-generated material. The
most widely received code practice sessions are transmitted by the ARRL’s
station W1AW from Newington, Connecticut, on several frequencies at differ-
ent times throughout the day. W1AW transmits bulletins and code practice
daily and through the weekends. You can find a complete W1AW operating

schedule at www.arrl.org/w1aw.html#w1awsked. Code practice may be
available on a VHF or UHF repeater in your area, too. Check with your local
radio clubs to find out.
The most important part of mastering Morse code is to just keep at it. You’ll
have days where conquering new letters and higher speeds just seem to come
effortlessly. Then days come when progress just seems elusive. Those plateaus
are the most important time to keep going because that’s when your brain is
completing its new wiring!
As you discover more code, work it into everyday life. For example, while dri-
ving to work, whistle or hum the code for license plates, billboards, and signs.
Just as you substitute foreign language equivalents for items you use or see as
practice, use the code over and over again to make it familiar.
Soon, you’ll notice yourself effortlessly copying bits and pieces that seemed
impossible only days before. Characters that seemed hopelessly opaque
become as natural as speech. Trust me — the 5 wpm you need to pass the
test is within your grasp if you’re willing to give it a try.

Finding a Test Session
Lucky for you, finding a schedule of test sessions in your area is pretty easy.
You can find the FCC Web site’s list of organizations that serve as Volunteer
Examiner Coordinators (VECs) in the different regions of the United States at
wireless.fcc.gov/services/amateur/licensing/vecs.html#vecs.
If a VEC in the list is close to you, start by contacting the organization. Many
of the VECs have a Web site and every one has an e-mail contact. Visit the
Web site or send an e-mail that says, “Hello, my name is . . . and I want to take
the Technician (or General or Amateur Extra) class license exam. Please send
me a list of examination sites and dates. I live in. . . . ”

If you don’t see a nearby VEC or if no exams are scheduled at times or 
places suitable to you, you can find an exam with one of these VEC national
organizations:
 ARRL VEC exams: The ARRL VEC operates nationwide and you can
search for exams based on your zip code at www.arrl.org/arrlvec/
examsearch.phtml, shown in Figure 6-1.
 W5YI VEC exams: Like the ARRL, the W5YI VEC (founded by Fred Maia
W5YI) operates nationwide. You can find a list of certified examiners to
contact at www.w5yi.org/vol-exam.htm.
 W4VEC VEC exams: The W4VEC (the call sign of the Volunteer Examiners
Club of America) covers the Midwest and southern states and provides a
list of dates and locations at www.w4vec.com/ar.html.
If you still can’t find a convenient exam for you, your final option is to write or
e-mail the VEC organizations at the addresses on the FCC Web site (wireless.
fcc.gov/services/amateur/licensing/vecs.html#vecs) and ask for

Signing Up for a Test
After you find a test session, you need to contact the test session hosts or spon-
sors to let them know that you are attending the session and what test elements
you want to take. Checking in ahead of time is not only good manners, but can
alert you to time or location changes. Some sessions do not allow unannounced
attendees, or walk-ins, so be sure to contact the test sponsor first.
Public exams
Most exam sessions are open to the public and are held at schools, churches,
or other public meeting places. Nearly all test sessions are open to walk-ins —
that is, you can just show up unannounced, pay your test fee, and take the
test — but some require an appointment or reservation. Checking first,
before you show up, is always a good idea.
Call or e-mail the session’s contact person to confirm the date, get directions,
and let him or her know what tests you need to take.
Exams at events
Test sessions held at public events are very popular ways to take a test. Finding
exam sessions being held at hamfests and conventions is very common. (See
Chapter 3 for information on these events.) These sessions can attract dozens
of examinees and often fill up quickly. Some exams are often given more than
once throughout the day, so you can take more than one test or can spend time
enjoying the event. As a test-taker, the FCC says you should not be required
to pay for attendance at the event just to take license exams, but you may
encounter a special entry fee. Don’t be afraid to call ahead and ask!
If you attend an event-sponsored exam, getting to the site early and register-
ing is a good idea. There may likely be multiple sessions and the tests for dif-
ferent elements may only be given at specific times.
Private exams
While the lion’s share of tests are given at public exam sessions, smaller ses-
sions may be held in a private residence, especially for a rural and small-town
testing facility. For example, since 1990, most of the new hams in my commu-
nity have passed their exams while sitting at my kitchen table!
73
Chapter 6: Taking the Test

When taking a test at a session in a private residence, please call ahead to
ensure room for you at the session and the examiners can prepare to admin-
ister the exam you want to take. You are a guest in someone’s home, so act
accordingly.
The Big Day
In the so-called Good Old Days, the higher-class license exam sessions were
conducted in federal office buildings by FCC employees. I vividly recall stand-
ing in line with dozens of other hams waiting for my shot at a new license.
Some of us drove for hours to reach the FCC office or test location, nervously
reviewing the material or listening to code tapes between swallows of coffee.
Inside, a steely-eyed examiner watched over us as our pencils scratched out
the answers.
These days, the exams are certainly more conveniently offered and the exam-
iners friendlier, but that doesn’t lessen your nervous anticipation as the day
arrives. The best way to do well, of course, is to be prepared. That means in
all aspects of the exams, not just the questions. The more you know, the less
you have to worry about.
What to bring with you
In each test session, the three basic steps are
1. Register for your exam.
2. Take the test.
3. Complete your paperwork (which I talk about in Chapter 7).
The examiners guide you through each step.
When coming to a test session, be sure to bring the following, whether you’re
licensed or not:
 Two forms of identification, including at least one photo ID, such as a
drivers license or employer’s identity card
 Your Social Security number (SSN)
74
Part II: Wading through the Licensing Process 

If you have a license and are taking an exam to upgrade to a higher class, you
also need to bring
 Your current original license and a photocopy
 Any original CSCE you have and a photocopy
CSCE is an acronym for Certificate of Successful Completion of Examina-
tion. This certificate is your record of having passed one or more exami-
nations. If you have just passed the Technician exam (Element 2), to get
on the air you have to wait for the FCC to grant you a call sign. For any
other license changes, the CSCE allows you to operate immediately with
your new privileges.
 If you have one, you can substitute your FCC Licensee Number (CORES
or FRN) for your Social Security number. (See Chapter 7.)
Along with your identification and any documents, also bring a couple of 
pencils and a calculator. You aren’t permitted to use any kind of online device
or a computer during the written exam unless you have a disability. (And you
need to first coordinate the use of supporting devices with the test adminis-
trators.) If you bring scratch paper, it needs to be completely blank. For copy-
ing code, if you plan to use a typewriter, keyboard, or computer, let the test
session administrators know in advance.
When you arrive at the test session, you sign in with your name, address, and
call sign, if you have one. The test administrators review any identification
and documents you have. You pay the test fee (currently $12 at exams
through the larger VECs) and then you are ready to take the exam!
Taking the written exam
The time for the test is finally here. You’ve shown up and you’ve signed in.
Now what? When do you start? Well, that depends on how many people are
signed up ahead of you and how many different types of tests are given. In a
small session, you may start the test immediately. In a larger session, you
may have to wait a while until your turn comes. Each written test takes from
15 to 45 minutes; code tests are shorter. The session may be organized so
that everyone starts and stops together or the testing may be continuous.
The examiner explains the process for your session.
As I discuss in Chapter 5, the written tests are multiple-choice tests. You
receive a pamphlet containing the test questions and an answer sheet for
recording your choices.
75
Chapter 6: Taking the Test

Follow these sure-fire tips to help you turn that tiger of a test into a pussycat
by keeping your thinker in top shape:
 Don’t: Take the test when you’re hungry, sleepy, or thirsty.
 Do: Wear a couple layers of clothing to make yourself comfortable what-
ever the room temperature, and visit the restroom before the session
starts.
 Don’t: Drink extra coffee or tea, but do take a vitamin or drink fruit juice.
 Do: Follow the directions for completing the identification part of your
answer sheet, even though you may want to start the test right away.
 Do: Study a question that seems really difficult, and then move on to the
next one. When you come back to the question later, it may seem crystal
clear.
 Don’t: Guess, unless it’s your only option. Generally, your first choice is
always your best choice. Unless you are quite sure, don’t change your
answers.
 Do: Completely erase the wrong answer or indicate clearly that you made
a change if you change any answers.
 Do: Remember to breathe and take a minute to stretch, roll your head,
or flex your arms and legs.
 Do: Double-check your answers before handing in your test to make sure
you marked the answer you wanted.
When you’re done with your exam, follow the administrator’s instructions for
turning in your paper, sit back, and try to exhale! Depending on the size of the
session, you may have to wait several minutes for the administrator to grade
your paper. At lease three Volunteer Examiners (VEs) verify the grades on all
exams. Written exams require a score of 75 percent or better to pass. You pass
code exams by either copying 25 characters in a row (numbers and punctua-
tion count as two characters) or by correctly answering eight of ten questions
about the text that is sent.
In all probability, because you studied hard and seriously, you get a big smile
and a thumbs-up from the test graders! Way to go! You can finally, truly relax
and move on to the next stage.
If you didn’t make it, don’t be disheartened. Many sessions allow you to take
a different version of the test as a second chance, if you want, both for code
and for written exams. Even if you don’t take the exam again right away, you
now know the ropes of a test session and you’ll be more relaxed next time.
Don’t let a failure stop you! Many hams make more than one attempt to pass
a test and they are on the air today.

Passing the Morse code test
The Morse code test is very basic: You listen to five minutes of code from a
tape or computer and write down (copy) what characters you hear. The test
goes something like this:
1. The VE starts the tape or computer and you get one minute of practice
code before the real test begins.
Be sure that you can hear the code generator clearly and let the test
administrator know if you can’t. Sometimes strong echoes interfere with
the code, so don’t be afraid to have the equipment adjusted or move
around until you can hear clearly. Take advantage of this time to relax
and get comfortable. Don’t worry if you don’t copy the practice minute
well, use the practice to get rid of your jitters.
2. Verbal instructions are given for the actual test code by the VE or
from the test tape.
Follow the instructions carefully despite the adrenaline coursing through
your veins.
3. Six V characters (meaning Test) are sent.
4. The actual test begins and continues for at least five minutes.
The code contains mostly text, including punctuation and numbers. The
text used for the ARRL-VEC exam is a sample contact with call signs and
typical information, such as signal report, location, operator’s name, and
type and power of equipment and antennas. In short, it’s very represen-
tative of the type of code you hear on the air.
For other code exams, the text may be anything from plain English to
random groups of characters, so you may want to check with the exam-
iners first to avoid surprises.
5. The volunteer examiners (VEs) evaluate your test paper.
You can pass the test in one of two ways:
You capture one minute of solid copy — 25 characters in a row
(numbers and punctuation count for two characters), excluding
spaces. Most of the students that I examine pass the test this way.
Answer eight out of ten questions about the contact you overheard.
Like written exams, you can take some easy steps to make your Morse test
easier.
77
Chapter 6: Taking the Test

 Don’t: Practice at very high or very low speeds, stay just a little faster
than the test speed.
 Do: Have at least one spare pen or pencil ready to pick up and use.
 Don’t: Scribble out or erase any miscopied characters, just make a
single line through them like THIS.
 Do: Leave an underscore when you miss a character, like __ this,
because you may recognize the word as you copy more letters. Making
the underscore for each missed character keeps you in the rhythm until
you get back on track.
 Don’t: Panic when you miss a character. Take a deep breath and focus
on an upcoming character.

Obtaining Your License
and Call Sign
In This Chapter
 Filling out your paperwork
 Watching for your call sign
 Choosing your own call sign
 Keeping your license valid
A
fter you pass your exam, only a small matter of paperwork separates
you from your new license. Your exam session volunteers help you com-
plete everything correctly and even send your paperwork in to the FCC for
you. You still need to understand what you’re filling out, though; that’s what
I cover in this chapter. Fill your paperwork out correctly and you won’t delay
the process of getting your call sign.
Completing Your Licensing Paperwork
After you successfully complete the exam, you need to fill out two forms:
 The first form you fill out is the CSCE (Certificate of Successful
Completion of Examination).
Figure 7-1 shows the ARRL VEC CSCE. The VEC and FCC use the CSCE as
a check against the test session records. Your copy of the completed
form is documentation of your test credit and is used to show credit for
the exam you passed at any other test session before you receive your
license or upgrade from the FCC. Keep your copy of the CSCE until the
FCC sends you a new license or records the change in its database. You
probably want to hang on to it as a record of your achievement.

 The second form you fill out is the NCVEC Form 605.
NCVEC Form 605 allows the FCC to process your new license. Whenever
you get a new license, upgrade to a higher class, renew your license,
change your name or address, or pick a new call sign, you use this form.
You can also submit name, address, or call sign changes directly to the
FCC by mail or online.
The volunteer examiners running the session send in your CSCE and NCVEC
Form 605 to the certifying VEC organization. Asking your examiners about the
average wait before the FCC updates your information in its database is a
good idea, but on average, you wait about seven to ten business days.
If you’re upgrading an existing license, you can go home and use those new
privileges right away. You have to add suffixes to your call sign to note that
you qualified for your new privileges. When your new license comes in the
mail or your new license class is recorded in the FCC database, you can drop
the temporary suffix. These new suffixes are the following:
 A General license adds /AG to your call sign on Morse code, and slash
AG or temporary AG on voice.
 An Amateur Extras license adds /AE to your call sign on Morse code, and
slash AE or temporary AE on voice.
Figure 7-1:
The ARRL
VEC CSCE.

Part II: Wading through the Licensing Process 

Don’t forget that you’re required to maintain your current mailing address on
file with the FCC. If you move residences or if your address changes, keep the
FCC database up to date. Mail sent to the address in the FCC database should
get to you in ten days or less. Your license is good only for ten years, so you
eventually have to fill out another Form 605 to renew it.
Finding Your New Call Sign
After you complete the test session and your paperwork is sent to the VEC,
you can begin watching the FCC database for your new call sign to appear.
After your call sign appears with your name beside it, you can get on the air
even if you don’t have the paper license.
The FCC has an online licensee information system called ULS (Universal
Licensing System), shown in Figure 7-2. Each licensee has a Federal
Registration Number, or FRN, that serves as identification within the FCC. I
outline the process of registering for your own FRN in the section
“Registering with the FCC Online.”
Figure 7-2:

Chapter 7: Obtaining Your License and Call Sign

The database that really counts is the one maintained by the FCC. Follow
these steps to find your call sign online:
1. Log on to wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/
searchLicense.jsp.
The FCC’s Universal Licensing System (ULS) Web page loads (see
Figure 7-3).
2. Click the Amateur link in the Service-Specific column in the middle
of the page.
The Search form appears.
3. Enter your last name in the Name box and zip code in the Zip Code
box in the Licensee section of the form, and then click the Submit
button.
You may wait a few seconds for the information to come up while
your request is processed. Figure 7-4 shows the results for Silver and
98070 — my whole family is licensed!

Chapter 7: Obtaining Your License and Call Sign
What if I don’t see my call sign?
Patience is difficult while you’re waiting, but be
sure to wait for at least one full calendar week
before getting worried. If two weeks pass, then
you can take some action.
 Contact the leader of the exam session and
ask if the VEC accepted your paperwork
and sent it to the FCC. Due to some problem,
a delay may have happened in getting the
session results accepted. This is rare; don’t
worry.
 If the paperwork went through okay and
it’s been more than ten business days (or
longer than the usual wait for the VEC that
coordinated your session), ask the session
leader to inquire about your paperwork. The
VEC can trace all applications to the FCC.
In more than ten years of being a session
leader, I have never experienced any lost or
delayed paperwork.

Most of the information you submit with your license application is a part of
the FCC database and is available to the public along with your FRN, if you
have one. When you submit your application, you agree to identify yourself
as a licensed ham and state where your fixed station (a station that doesn’t
move) is located. The FCC does not make your Social Security number, phone
number, or e-mail address available to the public.
In addition to the FCC Web site, you can also search other Web sites that
search the FCC database:
 QRZ.com (www.qrz.com): The best-known ham radio Web site; just type
the call sign into the Get Callsign search box at the top left-hand corner
of the page. If you don’t know the call sign, or prefer to search for a
name, click the Name Search link in the Get Help area on the left. When
the Name Search page loads, type your name, city, or zip code into the
Search box. The information you get from this search comes directly
from the FCC database. You can also search for non-U.S. hams if the data
from their country is available online.
 ARRL (www.arrl.org/fcc/fcclook.php3): Type your last name and
zip code and click the Submit Query button for results.
Registering with the FCC Online
The FCC has done a lot of work to make ordinary license transactions easier
to accomplish by creating the online Universal Licensing System (ULS). The
functions you can perform here include renewals, address changes, and other
simple services. To use this system, though, you need to register in CORES,
the Commission Registration System, whether or not the FCC has granted
your license.
To register, you supply a TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number), which is your
Social Security number, and you receive an FRN (Federal Registration
Number) that is your personal identification with the FCC for any license you
obtain. Each call sign is linked to a Licensee ID (the identification of the indi-
vidual or organization that applied for the license). After you have your FRN,
you can link your FRN with any call signs you hold.
Follow these steps to register with ULS/CORES as an individual Amateur
licensee:
1. Browse to wireless.fcc.gov/uls/.
The Universal License System Web page appears.
84
Part II: Wading through the Licensing Process 

2. Click the CORES/Call Sign button.
3. Select one of the following options and click the Continue button:
• Register Now: Select this option if this is your first time in the
Universal Licensing System.
• Update Registration Information: If you need to change any info
from the last time you were in the system, select this option.
• Update Call Sign/ASR Information: Choose this option if you need
to add or remove any of your call signs from the list that you asso-
ciated with your FRN. (Hams rarely use this option.)
4. Select the An Individual option and the location of your contact
address, and then click the Continue button.
5. Enter your name and address. Telephone and fax numbers and e-mail
addresses are optional.
Any field marked with an asterisk is a required field.
Everything you enter but your Social Security Number is available for
public inspection. The FCC also keeps all telephone numbers and e-mail
addresses private.
6. If you are registering for the first time, enter your Social Security
number.
You’re required to provide this information (or give a reason why you
can’t). You must enter your SSN without any spaces, hyphens, or peri-
ods. Ignore any prompts or windows asking for an SGIN. (SGIN stands for
a Sub-Group Identification Number and is used by managers of large
communications services with many call signs. You don’t need a SGIN.)
7. At the bottom of the window, enter a password of 6 to 15 characters
(or have the system pick one for you). Then re-enter it in the Re-enter
Password box.
When selecting passwords, using your call sign in any way is not a good
idea because an unauthorized person would try it as your password
immediately. The same principle applies to your spouse’s name, birth
date, or any other personal information.
8. Enter something that personally identifies you as being you in the
Hint box.
If you ever forget your password and want the FCC to tell you what it is,
this hint verifies you are who you are and not someone else. The per-
sonal identifier information could be your mother’s maiden name or you
can pick any word or words that fit in the window.
9. Click the Submit button.
85
Chapter 7: Obtaining Your License and Call Sign

10. Correct any errors.
At this point, the ULS lists any errors you made, such as omitting a
required item or adding the wrong type of information for a particular
field. If any errors are listed, go back and correct them, and then click
the Submit button again.
The window now displays a form with your licensee information, as well
as your Licensee ID Number, personal identifier, and password. Print this
information and keep a copy in case you forget your password.
You are now a registered person with the FCC. Follow these steps to associ-
ate your call sign with your FRN:
1. Click the FCC Universal Licensing System link at the bottom of the
page that confirmed your information.
2. Click the Call Sign/ASR Registration link.
A window with your FRN already entered loads.
3. Enter your password in the Password box and click the Continue
button.
4. Click the Enter Call Signs link.
The Enter Call Signs window loads.
5. Enter your call sign in the first space provided and click the Submit
button.
Congratulations! You and your call sign are now registered with the FCC.
Numerous services are available to you for free!
Picking Your Own Call Sign
You can pick your very own call sign, within certain limits, of course.
But if you’re the sort of person who likes having a license plate that says
“IMABOZO” or “UTURKEY,” you’ll enjoy picking a call sign from the
available list.
Occasionally, you hear a call sign consisting of one letter, one numeral, and
one number. These 1-by-1 call signs are granted on a temporary basis to U.S.
hams for expeditions, conventions, public events, and all sorts of noteworthy
activities. The special call sign program is administered by several of the
VEC organizations for the FCC. More information is available at www.remote.

Ham radio license plates
You can also acquire a license plate with your
call sign. The process is easy and many states
even have a special type of vanity plate just
for hams. Contact your local Department of
Motor Vehicles and ask! For additional informa-
tion see www.arrl.org/FandES/field/

One wrinkle for hams with call signs that con-

request the slashed zero specially. Talk to the
clerk that handles your form and show him or
her your license. The slashed zero should be
available for ham license plates.

initials. Whatever your preference, you’ll likely find a vanity call sign that
works for you.
You can find available call signs by using the FCC’s ULS call sign search func-
tions, but that can be quite cumbersome because it’s designed to return
information on only one call sign at a time. The following Web sites offer
better and more flexible call sign search capabilities:
 N4MC’s Vanity HQ (www.vanityhq.com/): By using N4MC’s Web site,
you can quickly determine whether call signs are available for
assignment.
 WM7D Callsign.net Callsign Database (www.wm7d.net/fcc/callsign.
html): This site includes a good search function that allows wildcard
characters, which speeds up your search for that perfect call sign.
 Vanity Call Sign Search (www.amateur-radio.org/vanity.htm): This
basic site has a good selection of search-and-sort features and links to
other vanity call sign Web sites.
After you select a vanity call sign, you can then follow the vanity call applica-
tion process described at www.arrl.org/arrlvec/vanity.html. You need
to provide a list of one or more call signs that you like. All the call signs must
be unassigned and available — that’s what you use the vanity call Web sites
for. Then you fill out the necessary application online and either pay the
$16.30 fee via credit card or by check.
Maintaining Your License
The FCC’s ULS has a specific section for the Amateur Radio Service that you
can find at wireless.fcc.gov/services/amateur/licensing/filing.
html. The ULS is the place to go if you want to do any of the following:
 Renew your license
 Change any of the address information associated with the license,
such as name or address
 Replace your physical license
 Check on an application
 Apply for a vanity call sign
Checking out this page when you first earn your license is a good idea so that
you are familiar with it when you need to take care of any licensing business.

Hamming It Up

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you find out about the real ham radio:
making contacts. I start by showing you how (and
where and when) to make contacts and what they usually
consist of. I show you how to use those cool handheld
radios that everybody seems to have as well as how to
pound brass — ham speak for Morse code. 
Ham radio also comes through when the chips are down
in emergencies, natural disasters, and just providing
public service. Definitely read these sections just to famil-
iarize yourself with the emergency-related possibilities —
even better, join in.
Many amazing activities take place on the ham bands
every day, including round-the-world DX-ing, making
contacts through amateur satellites, using your computer
to send and receive data using a radio, taking place in 
on-the-air competitions, even having your own amateur
TV station!

hen you have your ham radio (rig) set up and a license from the FCC
(ticket) clearing you for takeoff, you’re ready to make your first con-
nection. If this thought makes your palms a little sweaty, don’t worry; all
hams start out feeling just that way and survive. You will, too.
In this chapter I show you how to make a contact and I cover the basics of on-
the-air manners and the simple methods that make contacts flow smoothly.
With a little preparation, you’ll feel comfortable and confident, ready to get on
the air and join the fun.
Listen, Listen, Listen!
The most important part of successfully putting a contact, also known as a
QSO, in your logbook is listening. In fact, your ears are the most powerful
part of your station! The ham bands are a 24-hour-a-day party with people
coming and going all the time. And just like when you walk in to a big party,
you need to size up the room by tuning the band (listening at different fre-
quencies to assess activity) or monitoring (listening to an ongoing contact or
conversation) for a while before jumping in. By listening, you discover who’s
out there and what they’re doing, what the radio conditions are like, and the
best way for you to make contact.

Listening on the different bands
Operating on the shortwave or HF bands has a different flavor from the VHF
bands. On the HF bands, you can find stations on any frequency that offers
them a clear spot for a contact. Up on the VHF bands, most contacts take place
using repeaters on specific frequencies or channels spaced regularly by a few
kHz. How are you supposed to figure out where the other hams hang out?
HF, or High Frequency, bands cover 3 to 30 MHz and are usually thought of as
the shortwave bands. VHF, or Very High Frequency, bands cover from 30 to
300 MHz. UHF, or Ultra High Frequency, bands cover 300 MHz to 3 GHz.
Repeaters are radios that listen on one frequency and retransmit what they
hear on another frequency. Repeaters are usually in high spots such as hill-
tops or on tall towers so they can hear weak signals well and they have power-
ful transmitters so that they can be heard for a long distance. Repeaters allow
weak portable and mobile stations to communicate with each other over a
wide area. Repeaters are most useful on VHF and higher frequency bands.
On both HF and VHF, hams engage in specific activities and tend to congregate
on or near specific frequencies. For example, low-power (or QRP) aficionados
are often on the 20-meter band near 14.060 MHz. No rule says they must oper-
ate on that frequency, but they gather there routinely anyway. Having that kind
of consistency provides a convenient way to meet others with similar interests.
To continue my party metaphor, it’s the same as learning from another party-
goer, “A group is talking about jazz at that table in the corner.” Whenever
groups tend to congregate at particular frequencies, those frequencies are
known as calling frequencies.
Understanding sub-bands and band plans
In the United States, specific regulations exist about where each type of signal
transmits in a given band. These signals are called sub-bands. Figure 8-1 shows
the sub-bands for the 80-meter band. The American Radio Relay League (ARRL)
offers a handy chart showing the sub-bands on its Web site at www.arrl.org/
FandES/field/regulations/bands.html.
Outside the United States, regulations are much less restrictive. For example,
you’ll probably hear Canadian and overseas hams having voice contacts in a
part of the band where American hams don’t have phone transmitting privi-
leges. (Phone is an abbreviation for radiotelephone, which includes all voice
modes of transmission.) How unfair! Because of the number of American
hams, the FCC long ago decided that to maintain order, segregating the wide-
bandwidth phone signals from narrow-bandwidth code and data signals is
necessary. That’s just the way it is. So close and yet so far!

Beyond this segregation of the amateur bands, amateurs have collectively orga-
nized themselves in order to organize the different operating styles on each
band. Not all amateur users can co-exist on the same frequency, so having
agreements about where the different types of operations occur is necessary.
Band plans are based on the FCC regulations, but go beyond them to recognize
popular calling frequencies and the segments where you can usually find cer-
tain operating styles or modes. A complete list of all band plans is beyond the
scope of this book, but a good source of up-to-date U.S. band plans is on the
ARRL Web site at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/regulations/bandplan.
html#17m. Be aware that different band plans are outside the United States.
Europe and Japan, for example, both have substantial differences on certain
bands.
Tuning In a Signal
Tuning in a signal consists of using the main tuning knob on the radio to change
the radio’s operating frequency. The knob changes the frequency of a Variable
Frequency Oscillator, or VFO, that controls the radio’s frequency. The radio’s
operating frequency is displayed on a dial or display. A received signal’s fre-
quency is the radio’s displayed frequency when the signal is tuned in properly.

Chapter 8: Making Contact

The correct method of tuning in a signal depends on the type of signal it is.
On signals that you receive or copy manually — such as Morse code, SSB, or
FM — you use your ears. For signals sent using special equipment — such as
RTTY, packet, or PSK31 — you have to use the displays from the equipment
to get your receiver set just right. Whether you tune in a signal from above or
below its frequency doesn’t matter, although you may develop a preference
for one or the other.
To start, set your radio to the type of signal you want to receive — CW, USB,
LSB, or FM, for example. If your radio has a squelch control that mutes the
audio unless a signal is present, you should set it to its off position to let all
signals pass. That allows you to hear even a very weak signal as you tune by.
For help with the technical aspects of your equipment, try the Ham Radio For
Dummies Web site (as described in the Introduction to this book). The next few
sections outline a quick guide to tuning in the most common types of signals.
Morse code (CW)
Morse code signals are often referred to as CW, which stands for Continuous
Wave. Early radio signals would die out quickly because they were generated
by sparks. Soon hams discovered how to make steady signals, or continuous
waves, that they can turn on and off with a telegraph key. Morse code and
Continuous Wave (or CW) thus became synonymous.
To tune in to a Morse code signal, follow these steps:
1. Set the rig to receive Morse code by selecting the CW mode.
2. Set the rig to use a wide filter if your rig has more than one filter
available.
A wide filter allows you to find and tune in stations, while the narrower
ones block out nearby signals. Selecting filters is done with a Wide/
Narrow control or with switches labeled with the filter’s width. (Check the
operating manual for precise instructions.)
3. Adjust the main tuning dial until you hear a Morse code signal.
The pitch changes as you change the receiver’s frequency. Tune until the
pitch is comfortable to your ear. A low tone (300–600 Hz) is most restful to
the ear, but a higher tone (500–1200 Hz) often sounds crisper. Most radios
are designed so that when you tune in a signal with a tone or pitch around
500 Hz, the transmitted signal is heard by the other station at a similar
94
Part III: Hamming It Up 

pitch. If you prefer to listen to a note more than 100 Hz higher or lower,
check your rig’s operating manual to find out how you can adjust the
radio to accommodate your preferred pitch.
4. When you tune in the signal at your preferred pitch, select the nar-
rower filter (if available) to reduce noise and interference.
If the frequency is not crowded or noisy, you can stay with the wider filter.
Single-sideband (SSB)
Single-sideband (SSB) is the most popular mode of voice transmission on the
HF bands. (FM is mainly used above 50 MHz.) The mode got its name because
of a key difference from the older mode, AM, which is used by AM broadcast
stations and was the original voice mode hams used. Whereas an AM transmit-
ter outputs two identical copies of the voice information, called sidebands, 
a SSB signal only outputs one. This signal is much more efficient and saves
precious radio spectrum space.
Most voice signals on HF are SSB, so you have to choose between USB (Upper
Sideband) and LSB (Lower Sideband). The actual SSB signals extend in a narrow
band above (USB) or below (LSB) the carrier frequency displayed on the radio
(see Figure 8-2). How do you choose? By long tradition stemming from the
design of the early sideband rigs, on the HF bands above 9 MHz, voice opera-
tion is always on USB. Below 9 MHz, you find everyone on LSB.

Chapter 8: Making Contact

Because hams must keep all signals within the allocated bands, you need 
to remember where your signal is actually transmitted. Most voice signals
occupy about 3 kHz of bandwidth. If the radio is set to USB, that means your
signal appears on the air from the displayed frequency up to 3 kHz higher.
Similarly on LSB, the signal appears up to 3 kHz below the displayed frequency.
When operating close to the band edges, make sure your signal stays in the
allocated band. For example, on 20-meters, the highest frequency allowed for
hams is 14.350 MHz. You can tune a radio operating on USB no higher than
14.350 MHz -3 kHz = 14.347 MHz to stay legal.
If you tune across an old-style AM signal that has both upper and lower side-
bands, you can tune in the signal using either USB or LSB. The whistling noise
that gets lower and lower in frequency as you tune in the voice is the AM car-
rier frequency, centered precisely between the two voice sidebands. When
the carrier tone goes so low that you can’t hear it any more, you can listen to
either sideband.
To tune into an SSB signal, follow these steps:
1. Set your rig to receive SSB signals.
You may also have to choose Lower Sideband (LSB) or Upper Sideband
(USB).
2. Select the widest SSB filter.
3. Adjust the tuning dial until you hear the SSB frequency.
As you approach an SSB signal’s frequency, you hear either high-pitched
crackling (like duck quacking) or low-pitched rumbling. You can tell it’s a
voice from the rhythm, but it’s unintelligible. These are the high or low
frequency parts of the operator’s voice.
4. Continue to tune until the voice sounds natural.
If it sounds bass-y, your transmitted signal sounds too treble-y to the
receiving operator and vice versa.
FM
Frequency modulation (FM) is the most popular mode of transmission on the
VHF and UHF bands. FM signals encode the voice signal as frequency varia-
tions. Because hams adapted surplus FM radios used by businesses and public
safety agencies to the ham bands, operation was organized as channels on spe-
cific frequencies. This convention is also used today, so tuning on most FM rigs
consists of selecting different channels or moving between specific frequen-
cies, instead of a continuous frequency adjustment.
96
Part III: Hamming It Up 

To tune into an FM signal, follow these steps:
1. Set your rig to operate on FM.
Most VHF/UHF radios only use FM, so your radio may have a control for
selecting the mode.
2. Set the squelch control so that noise is heard.
This process is called opening the squelch.
3. Reset the squelch to stop the noise.
This process is to allow you to hear weak signals without having to listen
to continuous noise. For very weak signals, you may have to re-open the
squelch to receive it.
4. Using a band plan or repeater directory as a guide, select a frequency.
If you are using an FM-only rig such as a hand-held or mobile unit, you
can enter the frequency via a keypad, rotate a tuning dial that changes
frequency as on HF, or select between different memory channels. If hams
are active on that channel, you hear the operator’s voice. Depending on
the change in frequency with each step, you may have to tune back and
forth to find the frequency where the voices sound best. If you are mis-
tuned or off frequency, the voices are muffled or distorted.
If you are using a multi-band radio that uses a main tuning dial, you can
tune in the signal either by using your ear (tuning for the most natural-
sounding voice with the least distortion) or, if available, by watching a
tuning indicator called a discriminator, sometimes labeled DISC. The dis-
criminator shows whether you are above or below the FM signal’s center
frequency. When the signal is centered, you’re tuned just right.
Radioteletype (RTTY) and data signals
RTTY signals (sometimes pronounced ritty) consist of characters transmitted
as a sequence of two different tones, called mark and space. Each character
consists of a specific pattern of tones, alternating several times per second.
RTTY signals sound like a warbling bird that only knows two notes. You cannot
decode or generate RTTY signals manually, but you can with special equip-
ment external to the radio that has a serial data connection to a computer, or
by a computer sound card with special software. The radio treats the tones
of a RTTY signal as a voice signal, either receiving or transmitting.
You can tune in data signals, such as PSK or MFSK, using very similar tech-
niques and equipment. They are also constructed from audio tones and may
sound like warbling or bursts of tones. In the following tuning steps, treat DATA
as the equivalent to RTTY.
97
Chapter 8: Making Contact

To tune into a RTTY signal, follow these steps:
1. Set your radio to receive data signals, usually by a RTTY or DATA mode
control.
If your radio doesn’t have a DATA mode, use USB or LSB, following the
USB/LSB convention for the band you’re using. (The tones used for RTTY
are near 2 kHz; selecting RTTY sometimes makes the audio noise from
the receiver sound tinny as the receiver adjusts itself for higher-pitched
tones.)
2. Configure the external data encoder/decoder to provide a tuning indi-
cator; if you have a sound card, open a tuning window.
You need to consult the operating manuals to determine how to do that.
Tuning indicator styles vary, but most display a representation of the
received tones with overlaid guide lines or figures that allow you to align
the signal with the guide lines by tuning the receiver and adjusting the
volume or AF Gain control.
3. Tune in the data signal as you tune an SSB signal, but instead of listen-
ing for natural speech, watch the tuning indicator or window until the
signal’s tones properly align.
The received data window of the terminal or sound card software begins
to show characters coming in. If the characters are garbled, be sure you
are on the correct sideband (USB or LSB) or adjust the tuning slightly.
Your software or decoder probably has a troubleshooting section to
help you tune in the signal.
Listening on HF
Most of the traditional shortwave bands between 1.8 and 30 MHz are broadly
organized into two segments. Digital transmissions such as CW (Continuous
Wave, meaning, Morse code), radioteletype (or RTTY), and data occupy the
lower segment. Voice signals occupy the higher segment. Within each of these
segments, the lower frequencies are where you tend to find the long-distance
(or DX) contacts, special-event stations, and contest operating. Casual conver-
sations, known as ragchews, and scheduled on-the-air meetings (nets) gener-
ally take place on the higher frequencies within each band.
Table 8-1 provides some general guidelines where you can find the different
types of activity. Depending on which activity holds your interest, start at one
edge of the listed frequency ranges and start tuning. While tuning, use the
widest filters your radio has for the mode (CW, SSB, or FM) that you select.
You won’t miss a station if you tune quickly, and finding the right frequency
98
Part III: Hamming It Up 

when you discover a contact is easier. After you tune in a contact, then you
can tighten up your filters to narrower bandwidths, limiting what you hear to
just the one contact.

If every voice you hear seems scrambled, your rig is probably set to receive
the wrong sideband. Change sidebands and try tuning again.
Because the ionosphere strongly affects the signals on the HF bands as they
go from point A to point B, the time of day makes a big difference. On the lower
bands, the lower layers of the ionosphere absorb signals through the day, but
disappear at night, allowing signals to reflect off the higher layers and reflect
over long distances. Conversely, the higher bands require the sun’s illumina-
tion for the layers to reflect HF signals back to Earth, supporting long-distance
hops or skips. Table 8-2 shows the general guidelines for what you hear on the

different HF bands at different times of day. With the exception of sporadic
effects, the ionosphere is much less a factor on the VHF and UHF bands at 50
MHz and above.

Listening on VHF and UHF
Most contacts on the VHF and UHF bands are made using repeaters. Repeaters
are most useful for local and regional communication, allowing individual hams
to use low-power hand-held or mobile radios to make contacts over that same
wide area. For this scheme to work, the repeater input and output frequencies
are fixed and well-known, so the bands are organized into sets of channels.
(Repeaters are not used on the HF bands because of the need to both receive
and transmit simultaneously — difficult within single HF bands.)
Most VHF and UHF voice contacts use the FM or frequency modulation mode
of voice transmission because of its excellent noise suppression, making for
easy listening. The drawback is that FM doesn’t have the range of CW or SSB
transmissions. Contacts made directly between hams using FM are referred
to as simplex, and using a repeater, as duplex.
Repeater and simplex FM channels are generally separated by 20 kHz. You can
view a complete band plan for the 2-meter and 70-cm bands at www.arrl.org/
FandES/field/regulations/bands.html. I cover repeater operation in more
detail in Chapter 9.
100
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Repeaters enable you to use low-power and mobile radios to communicate
over a large distance. Many hams use repeaters as a kind of intercom to keep in
touch with friends and family members as they go about their daily business.
These contacts are generally much less formal than on HF and you likely hear
contacts between the same groups of hams every day. Repeaters are where
you find local hams and find out about local events.
To make contact via a repeater, you may have to enable tone-access on your
radio. Tone access adds one of several standard low-frequency tones to your
speech audio to let the repeater know that your signal is intended for it and is
not interference. If you do not transmit the required tone, the repeater does
not re-transmit your signal and you can not be heard. (The radio’s operating
manual can tell you how to select and activate the tones.)
Not all repeater channels have an active repeater. In order to find repeaters in
your area or while traveling, repeater directories are available from several
sources. Some of these directories are nationwide; local clubs or repeater
organizations publish others and focus on a specific region (see Figure 8-3).
101
Chapter 8: Making Contact
Dealing with beacons
After you tune the bands, you may still not know
for sure whether the band is open (meaning that
signals can travel beyond line-of-sight), and in
what direction. Propagation software is avail-
able to offer predictions to help make those
decisions, but those predictions are, well, only
predictions. To help determine whether a band
is open, beacon transmitters are set up around
the world. A beacon is a transmitter that sends
a message continuously on a known frequency.
Amateurs receiving that beacon’s signal know
that the band is open to the beacon’s location.
The biggest network of beacons in the world is
run by the Northern California DX Foundation
(NCDXF). The network consists of 18 beacons
around the world, as shown in the following 
figure. These beacons transmit on the 20-
through 10-meter bands in a round-robin
sequence. They also vary their transmitting
power from 100 to 1 watt so that hams receiving
the beacon signal can judge the quality of prop-
agation. A complete description of this useful
network is available at www.ncdxf.org/
beacons.
Other amateurs have set up their own beacons,
too. You can find listings of frequencies for these
amateur beacons on various Web sites. A good
reference for all beacons on HF and 6-meters is
the excellent list at www.keele.ac.uk/
depts/por/28.htm. Amateur VHF beacons
are listed on several Web sites; just enter ama-
teur VHF beacon into a Web search engine to
locate several beacon listings.

The directories and Web sites list frequencies and locations of repeaters so
you can tell which may be available in your area. Repeater directories also
list the required access tones and other operating information and features
for individual repeaters.
To listen to repeater contacts, follow these steps:
1. Use a repeater directory or Web search to find a repeater in your area.
2. Determine the repeater’s input and output frequencies.
3. Set up your radio to listen on the repeater’s output frequency.
You can also listen to stations transmitting to the repeater, called listen-
ing on the input.
4. Tune your radio as you do for FM signals.
If you need help tuning your radio, turn to the section “Tuning In a
Signal,” earlier in this chapter.
For direct ham-to-ham contacts on VHF and UHF over distances where FM
results in noisy, unpleasant contacts, use the more efficient CW and SSB modes,
which are called weak signal communication on VHF and UHF because you can
make contacts with much lower signal levels than by using FM. The very lowest
segments of the VHF and UHF bands are set aside for weak-signal operation.
Weak-signal operations are conducted in much the same way as SSB and CW
on HF with contacts taking place on semi-random frequencies centered around
calling frequencies. To tune in contacts on the weak-signal segments of VHF and
UHF bands, see the section “Tuning In a Signal,” earlier in this chapter.

Part III: Hamming It Up 

Deciphering a QSO
As you tune across the bands, dozens of contacts may be going on. That sounds
like a bewildering variety, but you’ll find that most contacts (or QSOs) are
one of three types:
 Casual conversation (ragchews)
 Nets
 Contesting (DX-ing)
Chewing the rag
Chewing the rag is probably the oldest type of activity in ham radio. I have no
idea where the expression came from, except possibly from “chewing the fat,”
but if you like to chat, you’re a ragchewer and are following in the footsteps of
the mythical master ragchewer The Old Sock, himself! Ragchewing is an excel-
lent way to build your operating skills, perhaps leading to an award such as the
A-1 Operator Club Award shown in Figure 8-4.

103
Chapter 8: Making Contact

Keep these things in mind while you’re chewing the rag:
 Start with your basic information: your call sign, signal report, operator
name, and the location of your station. Ragchews may be conducted
between hams in the same town or across the world from each other.
 After you exchange basic information, you may wander off in any direc-
tion. Hams talk about family, other hobbies, work, propagation, techni-
cal topics, operating, you name it, just about anything is discussed.
In general, hams avoid talking about politics or religious topics and
don’t use profanity. That leaves a lot to talk about, and hams seem to
cover most of it.
 Wrap up the contact when you run out of things to talk about, condi-
tions change, or maintaining contact is difficult. Exchange call signs
once more, and tune away.
Round tables are where a group of hams on one frequency share a contact
informally. Each ham talks in turn and all get a chance in sequence. A moder-
ator may also regulate round tables.
Meeting on nets
Nets, an abbreviation of networks, meet at a regular time and on a consistent
frequency. They have a theme — message handling (or traffic), emergency
communication training, nets for mariners or mobile stations, or topics such
as antique radios or technical Q&A.
Follow these tips when accessing a net:
 Check in with the net control station, or NCS, and list your business.
The NCS orchestrates all exchanges of information and formally termi-
nates the net when business is concluded.
The net may meet until all business is taken care of or just for a fixed
amount of time.
 If you’re a visitor, find out the specific time you can check in. Nets
often have a specific time when visitor stations can check in.
You can find nets on a specific topic or frequency online. For example, the
ARRL Net Directory is at www.remote.arrl.org/FandES/field/nets.
I discuss nets and net operation in more detail in Chapter 10.
104
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Contesting and chasing DX
Radio contests are competitions in which you exchange call signs and a short
message as quickly as possible. Chasing DX, or DX-ing, is the pursuit of con-
tacts with distant (for which DX stands) stations.
While contesting or DX-ing, follow these rules:
 Keep contest contacts short. In a contest, the object is generally to
make the largest number of contacts, so dilly-dallying around is not
desirable.
 Pass along just the minimum amount of information, called the
exchange. Then sign off in search of more contacts.
While DX-ing, keep contacts with rare stations short — just your call sign
and a signal report — if many are calling. Keeping contacts short allows
other hams to make a desirable contact, too. Ragchews with DX stations
are encouraged, if conditions support good signals in both directions. Try
to judge conditions and tailor your contact appropriately.
DX contacts are short because the distances are great and maintaining
contact is difficult.
 If you encounter stations making contest QSOs, listen until you figure
out what information is being exchanged before participating. By far,
the most common information is a signal report and your location (often
expressed as a numbered zone or section defined by the contest spon-
sor) or serial number (assign a serial number for each contact you make
in the contest). If it’s your fifth QSO in that contest, your serial number
is 5, for example. The contesters are happy to explain what information
they need. You can usually find the complete rules for contests in maga-
zines or on the sponsor’s Web site.
 Remember that not everyone speaks English. Most hams often know
enough words in English to communicate a name, location, and signal
report. Otherwise, an international set of Q-signals allows you to exchange
a lot of useful information with someone with whom you don’t share a
common language.
See the next section, “Q-Signals,” for more on Q-signals. DX-ing is a great
way to exercise that rusty high-school Spanish or German, too!
I cover contests and DX-ing in more detail in Chapter 12.
105
Chapter 8: Making Contact

Q-Signals
Q-signals began in the early days of radio as a set of standard abbreviations to
save time and allow radio operators who did not share a common language
to communicate effectively. Today, amateurs use Q-signals as shorthand to
speed up communication. The definitions have drifted a little over the near-
century of radio, but you find their use ubiquitous. (Table 8-3 lists many
common Q-signals.)
During contacts, Q-signals often take the form of a question. For example,
QTH? means “What is your location?” The reply, QTH New York, means “My
location is New York.”

Making a Call
Your big moment approaches! In this example, I use the dummy call sign of
KD7FYX. Replace this call sign with your own. Follow these steps when tuning
one of the HF bands:
1. Find someone to talk to.
When you come across a fellow ham making a general “come in, anybody”
call, you have found someone calling CQ. This situation is the easiest way
for you to make a contact. You hear something like this: “CQ CQ CQ this is
November Zero Alpha X-ray standing by. . . .”
November, Alpha, and X-ray are phonetics that represent the letters of my
call sign, NØAX. Phonetics are used because many letters sound the same
(think B, E, T, P) and the words help get the exact call sign across. Table
8-4 lists the standard phonetics hams use. You may encounter alterna-
tives, such as Germany instead of Golf, for instance. When in doubt, I
respond or call with the phonetics used by the station I want to contact.

Chapter 8: Making Contact

2. Carefully note their call sign and respond.
Press the microphone button, and say: “November Zero Alpha X-ray this
is Kilo Delta Seven Foxtrot Yankee X-ray (repeat twice more), over.”
Give the calling station’s call sign once (you don’t have to repeat this —
they already know it!) and then give yours three times (a 1-by-3 call). If the
calling station is very strong, you may just give your call twice. You don’t
need to repeat their call sign or shout, just speak in a normal, clear voice.
3. Listen for the response if the station hears you.
You may hear something like: “KD7FYX (possibly in phonetics) from
NØAX, thanks for the call. Your signal report is. . . .”
And you have a QSO in your logbook!
Making this kind of contact works a little differently on a repeater. Hams mostly
use repeaters as a kind of regional intercom, so they are less likely to make a
general call for a random QSO. For example, you never hear CQ CQ CQ . . . on a
repeater. Hams turn the radio on in the car or in the shack to listen for friends
or just monitor the frequencies. Your cue that someone is available for a con-
tact is that they announce their presence by saying, “This is NØAX, monitoring,”
or some other kind of general “I’m here” announcement. Just give them a 1-by-1
call, “NØAX this is KD7FYX,” and see if they come back to you. You also get
good results by calling a station immediately after they complete a contact.
Repeater usage tends to be more utility-oriented than on HF and you may find
the contacts a little briefer. To respond on a repeater where signals are proba-
bly quite clear, just give a 1-by-1 call: “NØAX this is KD7FYX.”
On CW or the digital modes, the process is much the same and looks like this:
1. Copy the calling station’s call sign.
You hear something like: “CQ CQ CQ DE NØAX NØAX NØAX K.”
DE is the telegrapher’s shorthand for “From.” K means “End of Trans-
mission, Go Ahead.” (Note: No upper- or lowercase characters are in
Morse code — “de” is equivalent to “DE.”)
2. Respond with a 1-by-2 or 1-by-3 call.
Say something like: “NØAX DE KD7FYX KD7FYX KD7FYX K.”
3. Listen for a response.
You probably hear something like: “KD7FYX DE NØAX TKS FOR THE
CALL—UR RST. . . .”
TKS is shorthand for “Thanks,” and UR is shorthand for “Your.”

Failing to make contact
But what if you try to make a contact and your call doesn’t get answered with
a response? Your signal may be too weak to hear or the station may have
strong noise or interference that you can’t hear. In this case, you find another
station to call. Assuming that your signal is strong enough for other stations
to hear it however, several other things may have happened:
 Other hams are calling at the same time. You can either wait around
until the station you intended to contact is free and try again, or you can
tune around for another contact opportunity. The most important thing
is not to get discouraged!
109
Chapter 8: Making Contact

 The calling station can hear you, but can’t make out your call. The
ham may either ask you to call again or respond to you, but won’t have
your call sign correct. The station may say: “station calling, please come
again.” Or “QRZed?” or “Who is the station calling?”
QRZed? is the international Q-signal for “Who is calling me?” Hams often
use the British pronunciation, Zed, for the letter Z. At this point, just
repeat your call two or three times, using standard phonetics and say,
Over when you finish.
The station gets your call wrong by a letter or two. First stand by a
few seconds to be sure another station with that call sign isn’t on the
same frequency. For example, I’m often on the air at the same time as
NØAXL and NØXA and we are always getting confused. If a couple sec-
onds go by and you don’t hear another station responding, then
respond with: “NØAX this is KD7FYX (repeat twice more), do you have
my call correct? Over.”
If repeated attempts at making contacts aren’t producing results, check out
your equipment. The easiest way is to locate a licensed friend and have him
or her make a contact with you. That way, you know your transmitter is (or
isn’t) working and your signal is understandable. If you don’t have a licensed
friend, run through the following checklist to be sure you’re transmitting
what, when, and where you think you should be:
 Are you sure you’re transmitting on the right frequency? Press the
microphone switch or press the Morse key, and watch the radio’s dis-
play very carefully. The indicators for frequency and sideband should
stay exactly the same. You may be transmitting on a different sideband
or frequency than you think you are!
 Are you sure that your transmitter is producing power? Watch the rig’s
power output meter to be sure the output power varies along with your
voice or keying.
 Is the antenna connected properly? You should be receiving signals that
are moderate to strong, indicating 4 to 9 S-units on the radio’s meter. If
the signals are very weak, you may have an antenna or cable problem.
This problem also shows up as an SWR reading of more than 5:1 on your
rig’s SWR meter.
After your call is received correctly by the other station, proceed with the
rest of the contact. Failed contacts and errors are handled very similarly on
CW and the digital modes. Don’t be bashful about correcting your call sign.
After all, it’s your radio name.
110
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Breaking in is not hard to do
Sometimes you can’t wait for the end of a contact to call a station. Interrupting
another contact is called breaking in, or breaking, because the proper proce-
dure is to wait for a pause in the contact and quickly say, “Break” (or send BK
with Morse code).
Why do you want to do this? Perhaps you have an emergency and need to
make contact right away. More frequently, you tune into a contact and the
participants are talking about a topic or person that you know about. If you
wait for the contact to end, you may not be able to contribute or help.
To break in a contact, follow these steps:
1. Listen for a good opportunity to make your presence known.
When the stations switch transmitting and receiving roles is usually a
good time to break in. You hear something like: “So Lowell, back to you.
KD7DQO from NØAX.”
2. Quickly make a short transmission.
Don’t be shy and wait or the other station begins transmitting. Say:
“Break.”
3. Wait to see if either station heard your transmission.
One station hears you and says: “This is KD7DQO, who’s the breaker?”
If no one hears your transmission, start over with Step 1.
4. Respond as if you’re answering a CQ.
Say: “KD7DQO this is KD7FYX (repeated), over.” Depending on the circum-
stances, you can then tell them your name and location before proceeding
to explain why you broke in. At that point, the stations probably engage
you in further conversation and you’re in a three-way QSO! Sometimes,
they won’t want to have a third party in the contact, in which case you
just courteously sign off and go on to the next contact.
Having a QSO
Because you listen to contacts (QSOs) on the air, you understand the gen-
eral flow of the contacts. What do hams talk about, anyway? Like most
casual contacts with a person you don’t know, warming up to a contact
takes a little time.
111
Chapter 8: Making Contact

During the initial phase of the contact, you exchange information about the
quality of the signals, your name, and your location. This phase is a friendly
way of judging whether conditions permit you to have an extended contact.
Then follow with information about your station and probably the local
weather conditions. This information gives the other station an idea of your
capabilities and whether static or noise is likely to be a problem.
Here are the common items you exchange when making a contact:
 Signal Report: This report is an indication of your signal’s strength and
clarity at the receiving station.
• SSB: A two-digit system communicates readability and strength,
although sometimes you can just use a single Q-number as a qual-
ity indicator.
• CW and RTTY: The same two-digit system is used for readability
and strength, but a third digit is added to indicate purity of the
transmitter’s note — rarely anything but 9 nowadays because
transmitting equipment is quite good. If a poor signal is encoun-
tered, don’t hesitate to give an appropriate report.
• FM: The signal report is the degree to which the noise is covered
up or quieting.
• Digital modes: Use the same method as CW or RTTY, or don’t
bother with a signal report at all.
See Table 8-5 for how to report your signal quality.
 QTH (Location): On HF, where signals take place over long distances, you
generally give your town and state or province. You can give an actual
address if requested, but it is usually not needed (if you aren’t comfort-
able doing so). On VHF/UHF, you report the actual physical location, par-
ticularly if you’re using a mobile radio.
 Rig: You can just report the power output shown on your transmitter’s
power meter (25 watts) or give the full model number and let your con-
tact assume the transmitter is running at full output power.
 Antenna: Typically, you just report the style and number of elements,
such as a two-element quad or 5⁄8-wave whip. Sometimes you can report
a specific model number.
 Weather: Remember that stations outside the United States report the
temperature in degrees Celsius! Standard weather abbreviations you can
use on CW and digital modes include SNY, CLDY, OVRCST, RNY, and SNW.
A Russian ham in Siberia once gave me a weather report of “VY SNW”
(very snow).

variations in strength as a vehicle is
moving. Just Making It means only
strong enough to actuate the repeater,
but not good enough for a contact.
After you go through the first stages of the QSO and the other station sounds
like the ham wants to continue, you can try discussing some other personal
information — your age, other hobbies, what you do for a living, your family
members, and of course ham radio topics such as propagation conditions,
any special interests, or particularly good contacts you made recently.
The FCC forbids obscene speech (which is pretty rare on the air). The three
topics that seem to lead to elevated blood pressures are politics, religion,
and sex — hardly surprising. So hams tend to find other things to talk about.
Oh sure, you find some arguments on the air from time to time, just like in
any group of people. Don’t be drawn in to doing it yourself — no one benefits.
Just spin the big knob and tune on by.
113
Chapter 8: Making Contact

The trick is to keep your transmissions short enough so that the other station
has a chance to respond or so that someone else can break in. That way, you
both can have a QSO just as long and detailed as you want. If propagation is
changing or the band is crowded or noisy, short transmissions allow you to ask
for missed information. At the conclusion of the contact, you may also encour-
age the other station to call in again. Lifelong friendships are sometimes forged!
Calling CQ
After you make a few contacts, the lure of fame and fortune becomes too
strong to resist — it’s time to call CQ yourself! How do you go about it so that
you sound right? If by now you have listened to dozens of CQs, which of them
sounded the best to you? What makes them sound good?
A CQ consists of two basic parts repeated in a cycle. The first part is the CQ
itself. For a general-purpose, “Hello, World!” just say “CQ”. If you’re looking
for a specific area or type of caller, you must add that information as in, “CQ
DX” or “CQ New England.”
The second part of the CQ is your call sign. You must speak or send clearly
and correctly. Many stations mumble or rush through their call signs or send
it differently each time, running the letters together. You probably tuned past
CQs like that.
A few CQs followed by “from,” or “DE,” and a couple of call signs makes up
the CQ cycle. If you say “CQ” three times followed by your call sign twice,
that’s a 3-by-2 call. If you repeat that pattern four times, it’s a 3-by-2-by-4. At
the end of the cycle, you add “Standing by for a call,” or “K,” to let everybody
listening know that it’s time to call.
An example of a 3-by-3-by-3 on CW is “CQ CQ CQ DE NØAX NØAX NØAX CQ
CQ CQ DE NØAX NØAX NØAX CQ CQ CQ DE NØAX NØAX NØAX K.”
Depending on conditions, repeat the cycle (CQ and your call sign) two to five
times, keeping it consistent throughout. If the band is busy, keep it short. If
you’re calling on a quiet band or for a specific target area, four or five cycles
may be required. When you’re done, listen for at least a few seconds before
starting a new cycle again to give anyone time to start transmitting.
Here’s a short list of CQ Do’s and Don’ts:
 Do: Keep your two-part cycle short to keep the caller’s interest.
 Do: Use standard phonetics for your call sign on voice modes at least
once per cycle.
114
Part III: Hamming It Up 

 Do: Send CW at a speed you feel comfortable receiving.
 Do: Strive to sound friendly and enthusiastic.
 Do: Wait long enough between CQs for callers to answer.
 Don’t: Mumble, rush, or slur your words.
 Don’t: Send erratically or run letters together.
 Don’t: Drag the CQ out. A 3-by-3-by-3 call is good for most conditions.
 Don’t: Shout or turn up the microphone audio level too far. Clean audio
sounds best.
Treat each CQ like a short advertisement for you and your station. It should
make the listener think, “Yeah, I’d like to give this station a call!”
The long goodbye
If hams do one thing well, it’s saying goodbye. Hams use abbreviations, friendly
names and phrases, and colloquialisms that pad the contact before actually
signing off. Hearing anyone say, “Well, I don’t have anything more to say, W1XYZ
signing off,” is rare.
Towards the end of the contact, let the other station know that you’re out of
gas. Some good endings are the following:
 I AM QRU: In Morse code speak, QRO means “out of things to talk about.” 
 See you down the log: Encourage another contact at a later time.
 BCNU: Morse code for “be seein’ you.”
 CUL: Morse code for “see you later.”
 88 or Old Man: Throw love and kisses to any female operator, regardless
of whether you know her well or not. Or tack on an affectionate “Old
Man” (if appropriate).
 73: Don’t forget your best regards! That’s required!
 Pulling the big switch or GOING QRT: If you’re leaving the airwaves,
then be sure to say so after your call sign on the last transmission. On
voice, say “NØAX closing down” or on a Morse code contact, “NØAX SK
CL.” Anyone listening knows you’re vacating the frequency.
Sometimes, the signing off takes as long as the signing on.

A
fter you tune around the amateur bands for a while, you’ll agree that the
lion’s share of the ham’s life is making relaxed, casual contacts. Some
contacts are just random “Hello, anybody out there?” calls. You’ll also hear
contacts between hams that are obviously old friends or family members that
meet on the air on a regular basis.
Lots of people also use ham radio to maintain contact, so to speak, while
they’re traveling. (I realize that this may be a shock, but in some places on
Earth, a mobile phone’s service indicator won’t light up!) In remote places,
ham radio is available to fill the breach. It’s fun and people enjoy contacting
travelers wherever they are.
I cover the technical aspects of station configuration and operation in Part IV.
(For more technical stuff, see the Ham Radio For Dummies Web site.) In this
chapter, you find out about the different ways to conduct these relaxing con-
tacts. Like most things in life, with making casual contacts, “there’s kindy a
knack to it,” as my dear Aunt Lexie used to say.
Before I start on this operating business, though, allow me to suggest that
you get a copy of the FCC rules. You can download them from the FCC Web
site or bookmark the URL (for reference), but the rules you find there, as writ-
ten, are not altogether easy to figure out. For a clearer alternative, you can
get The FCC Rule Book from the ARRL (www.arrl.org) for only a few dollars.

This rule book conveniently includes not only the rules themselves, but also
a clear discussion on do’s and don’ts, and information on technical standards
and the FCC Universal Licensing System. New hams should really have a copy
in their shack.
Operating on FM and Repeaters
Most new hams start out as Technician class licensees, which gives you
access to the entire amateur VHF and UHF bands. By far the most common
means of communicating on those bands is through the use of an FM
repeater (see Chapter 8).
Finding a repeater
Figure 9-1 explains the general idea behind a repeater. A repeater retransmits
(or repeats) FM signals that it hears on one frequency and simultaneously
retransmits them on another frequency. The received signals are not stored
and played back; they’re re-broadcast on a different frequency at the same
time they’re received, which is called duplex operation.
Repeaters use FM instead of SSB because of the relative simplicity of the trans-
mitters and receivers — an important consideration for equipment that is
operating all the time and needs to be reliable. FM is also relatively immune
from static if signal strength is good and so makes for a more pleasant contact.
Except for a small segment of the 10-meter band, FM is rarely found on HF due
to restrictions on signal bandwidth and FM’s relatively poor quality on weak
signals compared to SSB and CW. Above 30 MHz however, FM’s qualities are
ideal for local and regional coverage.
If the repeater is located on a high building, tower, or hill, its sensitive receiver
picks up signals clearly from even tiny, handheld radios. It then uses a power-
ful transmitter to relay that input signal over a wide area. Stations can be sep-
arated by tens of miles, yet communicate with each other using just a watt or
two of power by using a repeater.
Ham radio repeaters are constructed and maintained by either a radio club
or private individual as a service to the ham community. If one exists in your
area, consider joining or supporting a repeater user’s group or club in order
to help defray the cost of keeping the repeater on the air.
118
Part III: Hamming It Up 

To make repeater communications work, you have to know the frequency
on which a repeater listens and where it is transmitting. The listening fre-
quency (the one that listens for your signal) is called the repeater’s input
frequency and the frequency that you listen to is called the repeater’s output
frequency. The difference between the two frequencies is called the repeater’s
separation or offset. The combination of a repeater’s input and output frequen-
cies is called a repeater pair.
As Figure 9-2 shows, the repeater pairs are organized in groups with their
inputs in one part of the band and their outputs in another, all of them having
a common separation. Each pair leapfrogs its neighbor, with each input or
output channel separated by the same frequency, the channel spacing. The
input may be a lower frequency than the output or vice versa.

Chapter 9: Casual Operating

Figure 9-3 shows where the repeater segments of the five primary VHF/UHF
bands are located. The 6-meter band has three groups of repeaters: 51.12 to
51.98 MHz, 52 to 53 MHz, and 53 to 54 MHz. The 2-meter band also has three
groups: 144.6 to 145.5 MHz, 146 to 147 MHz, and 147 to 148 MHz. You can find
a single group on the 222, 440, and 1296 MHz bands. Repeaters are allowed on
the 902 MHz and 2304 MHz bands, but are not common. If you have a license
with HF privileges, you may want to give the 10-meter FM repeaters a try with
output frequencies between 29.610 and 29.700 MHz and an offset of –100 kHz.
Not all channels are occupied in every area and some variations are around
the country as to channel spacing and, in rare cases, offset. In order to find
out where the repeater inputs and outputs are for a specific area, you need a
repeater directory (see Chapter 8 for more on repeater directories). The
online directory at www.artscipub.com/repeaters/welcome.html is a
good resource to locate nearby repeaters.
If you don’t have a repeater directory and are just tuning across the band, try
using the following table. Table 9-1 lists the most common output frequencies
and repeater offsets to try. Tune to different output frequencies and listen for
activity. Remember: You have to set your radio’s offset appropriately for
each band.

Using tone access and DCS
In order to minimize interference from other repeaters and strong nearby sig-
nals, most repeaters now use tone-access. The tones are also known as sub-
audible, PL, or CTCSS (Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System). You may
have used tone-access on the popular Family Radio Service (FRS) and General
Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) radios as privacy codes. Tone-access keeps a
repeater or radio output quiet or squelched for all signals except ones carrying
the proper tone.
Regardless of the name, tone-access works like this: When you transmit to a
repeater, you must add a low frequency tone between 69 and 255 Hz to your
voice. (You can find a list of these tones in your radio’s operating manual.)
When the repeater receives your transmission, it checks your voice for the
correct tone. If it detects the correct tone, the repeater forwards your voice
to the repeater output. This system prevents interfering signals from activat-
ing the repeater transmitter — these signals won’t carry the correct tone
signal and thus are excluded from transmission. For a more detailed discus-
sion of tone-access, see the ARRL Handbook or the December 1996 QST arti-
cle, “Decoding the Secrets of CTCSS,” by Ken Collier KO6UX.
Many recent radio models have a tone decoder function that detects which
repeater is using a given tone. However, if your radio doesn’t have this func-
tion, and you don’t know the correct tone, you can’t use the repeater. How
can you find out what the proper tone is? Check with a repeater directory,
which lists the tone and other vital statistics about the repeater. When you
determine the correct tone — either via the tone decoder function or the
repeater directory, you can then program your radio to send the correct tone
and activate the repeater.
122
Part III: Hamming It Up 

DCS (Digital Coded Squelch) is, like tone-access, another method for reducing
interference. It allows you to hear audio from only selected individuals. DCS
consists of a continuous sequence of low-frequency tones that accompanies
the transmitted voice. If your receiver is set to the same code sequence, it
passes the audio to the radio’s speaker. If the transmission uses a different
code, your radio remains silent. Most people use DCS to keep from having to
listen to all of the chatter on a repeater, only hearing the audio of others
using the same DCS code.
Be aware that not all repeaters pass the tone-access or DCS tones through to
the transmitter and may filter them out.
Using simplex
When one station calls another without the aid of a repeater, both stations
listen and talk on the same frequency, just as contacts are made on the HF
bands, which is called simplex operation. Hams use simplex when they’re just
making a local contact over a few miles and don’t need to use a repeater.
Interspersed with the repeater frequency bands in Figure 9-1 are small sets of
channels designated for simplex operation.
Having a common simplex channel is a good way for a local group of hams to
keep in touch. Simplex frequencies are usually less busy than repeater fre-
quencies and have a smaller coverage area, which makes them useful as local
or town intercoms. Clubs and informal groups often decide to keep their
radios tuned to a certain simplex frequency just for this purpose. If they’re
not having a meeting or conducting some other business, feel free to make a
short call (“NØAX this is W7FMI”) and make a friend.
On bands with a lot of space, such as the VHF and UHF bands, making con-
tacts outside of the repeater channels is easier if you know approximately
where the other hams are. That’s the purpose of calling frequencies — to get
contacts started. You hear hams call CQ (the general “come in, anybody”
call) on a calling frequency and, after establishing a contact, move to a
nearby frequency to complete it. For example, if I call CQ on 52.525 MHz and
N6TR answers me, I say, “N6TR from NØAX, hi Larry, let’s move to five-four,
OK?” This transaction means I receive N6TR and am tuning to 52.54 MHz, a
secondary simplex frequency.
Making a couple of complete contacts on calling frequencies is okay if the
band isn’t busy, but otherwise move to a nearby frequency.
123
Chapter 9: Casual Operating

A national FM simplex calling frequency is set aside on each band just for
general “Anybody want to chat?” calls. These frequencies are 52.525, 146.52,
223.50, 446.00, and 1294.5 MHz. When driving long distances, I often check
these channels to meet up with other travelers on the highways. Visitors to
your area often tune to these frequencies, so monitoring them is a good way
to make travelers feel welcome or give directions.
If you are traveling and want to make a contact on the simplex calling fre-
quencies, the best way to do so is to make a transmission similar to this one:
“This is NØAX November Zero Alpha X-ray mobile on Interstate 90.
Anybody around?”
Repeat this transmission a couple of times, spaced a few seconds apart. If
you are moving, try making a call once every five minutes or so. Be sure to
tell listeners you’re traveling and your approximate direction. If you are oper-
ating away from your home area, add “portable” or “portable (call district
number)” to your call as an additional bit of information.
Because simplex communications don’t take advantage of a repeater’s lofty
position and powerful signal, you may have to listen harder than usual on
these frequencies. Keep your squelch setting just above the noise level.
When you’re making a call, you may want to open the squelch completely,
so you can hear a weak station responding.
Solid simplex communications usually require more power and better
antennas than a typical hand-held radio, at least on one end of the contact.
To get better results on simplex with just a few watts, try using a mobile
antenna, a full-size ground plane, or a small beam. I discuss these antennas
in Chapter 12.
Setting up your radio
After you figure out offsets, tones, and repeater frequencies, take a few min-
utes and check out your radio’s operating manual. To make repeater (or sim-
plex) contacts, you need to know how to do each of the following:
 Set the radio’s receive frequency and transmit offset. Know how to
switch to simplex (no offset) or to listen on the repeater’s input
frequency.
 Turn sub-audible tones on or off and change the tone. If your radio
has the capability, know how to determine what tone frequency is
being used.
124
Part III: Hamming It Up 

 Turn the Digital Squelch System on or off and change the codes.
 Store the radio settings in a memory channel and access different
memory channels.
Contacts, FM style
Operating and making contacts on FM is sufficiently different from the style of
SSB or CW that it can confuse new licensees. Because VHF and UHF FM voice
contacts are usually local or regional, they tend to be for personal utility,
rather than to make random acquaintances. Most hams have a few favorite
repeaters or simplex frequencies that they use as a sort of regional intercom.
They turn on a radio in the shack at home or in the car and monitor a chan-
nel or two to keep an ear out for family or friends. Even though a number of
people may be monitoring a repeater, they mostly just listen unless someone
calls them specifically or they hear a request for information or help.
This style can be a little off-putting to hams new to FM and can even seem
unfriendly at times. Rest assured that the hams are not being unfriendly,
they’re just not in “meet and greet” mode on the repeater or a favorite sim-
plex channel. Imagine the difference between meeting someone at a party
versus at a grocery store. At the party, everyone makes new acquaintances
and has conversations. At the store, people aren’t there as a social exercise
and may even seem a little brusque. Keeping this idea in mind, the following
sections cover some suggestions to help get some experience with the
FM style.
Joining the group
The best way to become acquainted with a group is to participate in its activ-
ities. Nets are a very common group use of FM repeaters.
The most common nets on FM are for emergency services groups, weather
and traffic (the automobile kind), and equipment swap meets. Technical
assistance nets exist as well as nets that handle radiograms into and out of
your area. (I discuss traffic handling in Chapter 10.) Use the ARRL net search
Web page at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/nets/client/netsearch.html
to find local nets on the VHF and UHF bands. Your Elmer may be able to help
you out with times and frequencies, as well.
Almost all nets call for visitors, generally at the end of the net session, and
that’s your chance. When you check in (all you have to do is give your call
sign and maybe your name), ask for an after-net contact with the net control
station or a station that had something of interest to you. After-net contacts
125
Chapter 9: Casual Operating

are initiated on the net frequency after the net is completed. Sometimes they
are held on the net frequency and other times the stations establish contact
there and move to a different frequency.
During the after-net QSO, you can introduce yourself and ask for help in find-
ing other nets in the area. If you have specific interests, ask if the station
knows of other nets on similar topics. Hopefully, you get a referral and maybe
even a couple of call signs to contact for information.
By checking into a few nets, your call sign starts to become familiar and you
have a new set of friends. If you can contribute to a weather or traffic net, or
accept a radiogram destined for your town or neighborhood, by all means do
so. Contributing your time and talents helps you become part of the on-the-
air community in no time.
Seizing the opportunity
As you monitor the different channels, which repeaters encourage conversa-
tions and which don’t becomes apparent. If you can identify a repeater that is
ragchew-friendly, you have a fairly easy time making a few casual contacts.
Listen for a station accessing the repeater, which sounds something like:
“NØAX monitoring” or “NØAX for a contact.” When you hear that, respond
with a quick one-by-two call using phonetics, such as “NØAX this is KD7DQO,
Kilo Delta Seven Delta Queen Ocean, over.” By convention, calling CQ is
reserved for SSB and CW operations where you’re not sure who is out there
and signals are generally weaker. To fit in with FM’s intercom style, just make
short transmissions.
Continue your contact as you do other contacts (see Chapter 8), but keeping
your transmissions short is important. Repeaters have a time-out function
that disables the transmitter if the input is busy for more than just a few
(typically three to five) minutes. This time-out function prevents overheating
the transmitter and also keeps a long-winded speaker from locking out other
users. When you’re transmitting, if you let up on the mike switch and no
repeater signal comes back, you may have timed-out the repeater. Just let
the repeater rest for 10 or 15 seconds and the receiver re-enables and the
timer resets. No need to be embarrassed (unless you keep doing it) because
all hams have done it more than once.
Open and closed
If you purchase a repeater directory, you may see some repeaters are marked
as closed, and are not open to the ham radio public. Some repeaters are closed
because they are dedicated to a specific purpose, such as emergency com-
munications. Some repeaters are intended to be used by only a supporting
126
Part III: Hamming It Up 

group. Rest assured that you can use a closed repeater in case of emergency,
but respect the wishes of its ownership and don’t use it for casual operation.
If you aren’t sure whether the repeater is closed or not, transmit to it and ask,
“This is NØAX, is a control operator on frequency?” If you get a response, that’s
the person to ask.
Repeater features
You can find an amazing set of features out there in repeater land. Many
repeaters have voice synthesizers that identify the repeater and announce
the time and temperature. Hams using the repeater can activate and deacti-
vate some functions, such as autopatch and automated announcements of
time or temperature, by using Touch-Tone tones from the keypads commonly
found on microphones. Repeaters are linked together to provide wide cover-
age even across bands.
In the next few sections, I only touch on the basics of repeater operation and
features. Repeaters are widely used all over the world and a wealth of other
information is available for you to consult as you grow more experienced and
curious about repeater and FM operations. Check the following Web sites for
more information:

prehensive links on many different ham radio topics.

This site offers a lot of links to repeater groups in the United States.
Autopatch
The best known feature of repeaters is called autopatch. This feature allows
a repeater user to make a telephone call through the repeater! By accessing
a repeater’s autopatch function, a dial tone appears on the air. When you
use the numeric keypad commonly found on your radio or microphone, the
tones feed through the telephone system, which dials the number and con-
nects you.
All autopatch calls occur over the air — they’re not private.
127
Chapter 9: Casual Operating

Although you can do a lot of important things with autopatch — most hams
use it to call 911 to report accidents, for example — you should use this func-
tion wisely. You must use special access codes to activate the feature. To
get these codes, you may be required to join the club or group that maintains
the repeater. Some limits are in place on what you are allowed to do via
autopatch. For example, conducting business is forbidden as on any amateur
frequency. (You can perform a limited amount of personal business, such as
calling a store or — my favorite — ordering a pizza.) And most repeater sys-
tems place strict limits on the area codes that you can dial to prevent incur-
ring long-distance charges.
With mobile phone service nearly ubiquitous today, autopatch is not the
unique capability it once was. Even so, in certain conditions, like if your cell-
phone can’t find a suitable service provider or if the mobile phone systems
are overloaded or unreachable, autopatch may be able to get through.
If your radio has the autopatch feature and you obtain the tone sequences,
follow these steps to make a phone call (the exact steps may vary from
repeater to repeater):
1. In an emergency, break in to an ongoing contact and ask the stations
to stand by for an emergency autopatch.
If it is not an emergency, wait until the channel is clear.
2. Tell the repeater you’re switching to autopatch and without releasing
the microphone button on the microphone, press the activation
sequence of tones. Release the mike button.
For example, if your call sign is NØAX, you say, “NØAX accessing
autopatch,” and press *82 or #11.
3. The repeater acknowledges your sequence with some kind of tone,
synthesized voice, or maybe just the telephone system dial tone.
If you don’t hear an acknowledging transmission, go back to Step 2. You
may have trouble if your signal is fluttery or noisy.
You can also ask for another repeater user to activate the autopatch
function for you.
4. When you hear the dial tone, press the tone keys for the number you
want to dial.
You may have to precede the telephone number with a dialing code,
depending on the repeater’s specific operating requirements.
5. When someone answers your call, tell him or her you’re using a radio.
For example, you can say, “This is (your name) and I am using an ama-
teur radio autopatch system.” This transmission lets him or her know
128
Part III: Hamming It Up 

that a radio link is involved so you both can’t talk at once. Emergency
services dispatch operators are generally familiar with autopatch, but
pizza delivery operators may not be.
6. Transmit your message.
Keep it short and appropriate for a public conversation.
7. When you finish, key in the hang-up tones (if needed) while keeping
the mike button pressed and tell the repeater you’re disabling
autopatch.
For example, say “This is NØAX releasing autopatch.”
8. The repeater acknowledges the release with an announcement similar
to that at activation.
9. (Optional) You may let the other repeater users know that you are fin-
ished and can resume normal operation.
Repeater networks
Some repeaters can be linked together in networks that provide coverage
over wide areas. For example, the system of repeaters known as the Cactus
Inter-tie allows users to communicate using their local repeater in an area
that covers Los Angeles to the east and north as far as Texas and Utah,
respectively. In my area, the Evergreen Inter-tie links repeaters throughout
the Pacific Northwest and Canada. The Target Repeater System hooks up
hams from Ohio through Virginia. Many more of these networks exist, as evi-
denced by the list at www.qsl.net/w9sar/repeaters.html. Repeaters may
be linked at all times or only under the control of authorized operators.
To use these systems, you need to find out which local repeaters are “on the
inter-tie,” usually by browsing the Web site for the repeater system. If you
decide to become a member of the group that maintains the network, you get
access to the control tone sequences that activate the network connections.
You can usually find the necessary information about joining a group on its
Web site; or you can listen for a group member controlling the repeater and
give him or her a call. Membership requirements and expectations vary, so
be sure you can meet them before signing up. Setting up a repeater link
across several states from a hand-held radio is pretty neat!
Linking repeaters with the Internet
The latest advance in repeater linking is a novel hybrid system that marries
the VHF/UHF repeater to the Internet. Several systems allow repeater users in
one spot to tunnel through the Internet and pop up somewhere very far away,
indeed! IRLP, iLINK, and Wires II are all examples of such systems. I use IRLP
to illustrate the concept.
129
Chapter 9: Casual Operating

IRLP uses Voice-Over-IP (VOIP) technology to connect repeaters all over the
world. This technology allows hams with hand-held portables to chat with
more than 20 other countries around the world in more than 30 countries as
of late 2003. You can even find IRLP on Ross Island in Antarctica! Figure 9-4
shows the basic IRLP system.
A node is a regular FM repeater with an Internet link for relaying digitized
voice. A user or control operator can direct an IRLP node to connect to
any other IRLP node. When the node-to-node connection is made, the audio
on the two repeaters is exchanged, just as if both users were talking on the
same repeater. Having contacts between Europe and New Zealand with
hams on both ends using hand-held radios putting out just a watt or two
is common!
You can also connect several nodes together using an IRLP reflector. The
reflector exchanges digitized audio data from any node in real time with sev-
eral other nodes. Even a user without a radio can join in by logging on to an
IRLP reflector or node. All users that cause radio transmissions to be made
have to be licensed though.

Using the IRLP system is very much like using an autopatch system. You
don’t need anything more than your radio, the IRLP system control tone
sequences for your repeater, and a list of the four-digit node on-codes that
form the IRLP address of active IRLP repeaters. To connect to another 
IRLP-enabled repeater, follow these steps:
1. Enter an IRLP access code.
The access code sets up the repeater to accept an IRLP on-code. This
process is just like activating autopatch.
2. When the repeater indicates that the IRLP system is ready, enter the
tones that send the on-code of the repeater that you wish to connect to.
Enter the tone is just like entering a telephone number into an autopatch
system. You can find a list of the available IRLP nodes and their on-codes
at status.irlp.net.
3. After a short delay, the node you connected to identifies itself in plain
voice with a call sign and location and you are connected!
Any transmissions you make transmit on the remote node and you hear
all the audio from the other node. If the other node is busy with another
IRLP connection, you hear a message to that effect. Try another node or
come back later.
4. When you finish, use the IRLP control codes to disconnect, as with an
autopatch.
You can get more complete information on the IRLP system through several
Web resources. An introductory article at www.eham.net/newham/irlp gives
a good overview of the system. If you’re really interested in the complete
technical details and maybe even putting together your own IRLP node, the
IRLP home site at www.irlp.net has complete details.

Chewing the Rag
I first mentioned ragchewing in Chapter 8 as a likely way that you make your
first contacts. In this section, I go into a little deeper detail about the ham eti-
quette of the ragchew.
131
Chapter 9: Casual Operating

Knowing where to chew
You know enough about ham radio that you can’t just spin the dial and start
bellowing into a microphone. Although ragchewing isn’t listed on any band
plan, you can find ragchewers on certain parts of every band.
On the HF frequencies below 30 MHz, the bands all have a very similar struc-
ture: CW (Morse code) and data modes occupy roughly the lower third and
voice modes occupy the upper two-thirds. This structure is true even on the
WARC bands of 17 and 12 meters where no formal division between the modes
is made.
Figure 9-5 shows how the general operating styles are organized on a typical
HF band. You find the ragchewers mixed in with the DX contacts on the lower
end of the band. Sometimes, if a super-rare station comes on the air, the
sheer numbers of DXers calling crowd a sustained contact (a pileup), so the
ragchewers move up the band. The ragchewers space themselves out around
the nets, round tables, calling frequencies, and data signals, taking advantage
of ham radio’s unique frequency agility to find an empty spot on the band.

Part III: Hamming It Up 
What’s a WARC?
WARC refers to the international World
Administrative Radio Conference of 1979. At that
conference, amateurs worldwide were granted
access to three new bands: 30, 17, and 12
meters. These new bands were immediately
nicknamed the WARC bands to distinguish them
from the older ham bands at 160, 80, 40, 20, 15,
and 10 meters.

DX-ing takes place at the lower end of the band for two primary reasons:
 Long-distance contacts are generally more difficult to make than
regional or local contacts. The signals are weaker and DX enthusiasts
find each other easier if they tend to operate in one area of the band.
 After the bands were divided into different sub-bands for the differ-
ent license classes, fewer higher-class operators were in the lowest
segments of the bands. The rarer DX stations took advantage of the
lesser population of U.S. hams in those lower band segments to reduce
the crowd pursuing them on the air.
Because DX-ing tends to attract a crowd, this concept is somewhat incompat-
ible with the more ordered operating style of nets. Therefore, those types of
operations would gather at the “other end” of the bands. With this structure,
groups can engage in their preferred style of operating without interference.
Data and Morse code styles tend to be incompatible and so the data signals,
such as radioteletype (RTTY) or PSK, also stay towards the higher portion of
the band. Not many nets use Morse code and data, so data signals don’t inter-
fere too much.
You may think that ragchewers are buffeted from all sides, but that’s not
really the case. A lot of ragchew contacts take place all the time and so they
tend to occupy just about any spare bit of band. To be sure, in the case of
emergencies (when a lot of nets are active), major expeditions to rare places,
or on weekends when big contests are running, the bands may seem too full
to get a word in edgewise.
The FCC can declare a communications emergency and designate certain
frequencies for emergency traffic and other communications. Keeping those
frequencies clear is every amateur’s responsibility. The ARRL broadcasts
special bulletins over the air on W1AW, by e-mail, and on its Web site if the
FCC does make such a declaration. The restrictions are in place until the FCC
lifts them.
On the VHF and UHF bands, you can usually find ragchewing in the repeater
sections of the bands, although wide open spaces for a conversation are
available in the so-called “weak signal” portions of the bands. Table 9-2 lists
the calling frequencies and portions of the VHF/UHF bands. The operating
style in this portion of the bands is similar to HF as far as calling CQ and
making random contacts, but the bands are less crowded.

The lower portion of the VHF/UHF bands is referred to as a weak signal
although that’s really a misnomer. The reason for the name is that contacts
using CW and SSB can be made with considerably weaker signals than on FM.
Most of the CW and SSB signals you hear are quite sufficiently strong for
excellent contacts, thank you!
Knowing when to chew
Whether you’re on HF or VHF/UHF, you find ragchewing has its good times
and poor times. When calling CQ (signifying that you want to talk to any
station), you can let it be known that you’re looking for an extended contact
in a number of ways. You also hear numerous clues that a ragchew may not
be what another station has in mind.
134
Part III: Hamming It Up 

I keep coming back to this point, but listening is the best way to learn operat-
ing procedures in ham radio. The most important part of any amateur’s sta-
tion is between the ears! If you want to call CQ successfully, then spend some
time listening to more experienced hams do it.
The good times
Assuming that you’re tuning an open band (signals are coming in from vari-
ous points), when is a good time to ragchew? First, consider the social
aspects of your contact timing. Weekdays are generally pretty good days to
ragchew, especially the daylight hours when hams that have day jobs are at
work. Remember: It may be a different time of day at the other end of the
contact, particularly if the other station is DX.
You may want to revisit Chapter 8 when considering what band is best to use.
If you like to talk regionally, you can always use a repeater or one of the lower
HF bands. To talk coast-to-coast, one of the higher bands is your best bet.
The better your antenna system, the more options you have.
Lots of hams do their operating on weekends, but that’s also when special
events and contests are held. Be prepared for a full band on Saturday and
Sunday every weekend of the year. The silver lining to the cloud is that plenty
of hams are on the air for you to contact! If you know that one mode or band
is host to some major event, you can almost always find a quiet spot on the
other mode or other bands. The WARC bands never have contests and are
usually wide open for ragchews and casual operating.
Not-so-good times
Because a good ragchew lasts for a long time, pick a time and band that offer
stable conditions. Propagation changes rapidly around sunrise and sunset.
Local noon can be difficult on the higher bands. Don’t be afraid to try any old
time; you may surprise yourself and you’ll learn about propagation from the
best teacher — experience!
Because weekends are busy times, you should check the contest and special-
event calendars (see Chapter 10). A little advance warning helps keep you
from being surprised when you get on the air and allows you to be flexible in
your operating.
135
Chapter 9: Casual Operating

136
Part III: Hamming It Up 
When the bands seem frustratingly full, here are some helpful strategies that
keep you doing your thing:
 The majority of nets and all contests are run on the traditional bands.
The WARC bands almost always have sufficient space for a QSO.
 Only a few contests sponsor activity on both phone and CW. No con-
tests have activity on phone, CW, and data. You can change modes and
enjoy a nice ragchew.
 Be sure you know how to operate your receiver. Cut back on the RF
sensitivity, use your narrower filter settings, know how to use controls
such as the IF Shift or Passband Tuning controls, and generally be a
sharp operator. You can remove much interference and noise just by
using all the adjustments your receiver provides.
 Always have a backup plan! There’s no guarantee that any particular
frequency is clear on any given day. Hams have “frequency freedom”
second to none, so use that big knob on the front of your radio!
Identifying a ragchewer
If you’re in the mood for a ragchew and you’re tuning the bands, how can you
tell if a station wants to ragchew? The easiest way is finding an ongoing
ragchew and joining it. You can break in (see Chapter 8) or wait until one sta-
tion is signing off and then call the remaining station.
Otherwise, the key is in the CQ. Cues that the other station is looking to
ragchew include a relaxed tone of voice and an easy tempo of speaking. Look
for a station that has a solid signal — not necessarily a needle-pinning strong
station, but one that is easy to copy and has a steady signal strength. The
best ragchews are contacts that last long enough for you to get past the
opening pleasantries, so find a signal that you think can hold up.
One cue that the station is not looking for a ragchew is a targeted call. For
example, you may hear, “CQ New York, CQ New York from W7VMI.” W7VMI
likely has some kind of errand or message and is interested in getting the job
done. Perhaps the station is calling, “CQ DX” or “CQ Mobiles,” in which case,
if you’re not one of the target populations, keep on tuning.
Another not-a-ragchew cue is a hurried call or a call that has lots of stations
responding. This station may be in a rare spot, in a contest, or at a special
event. Keep on tuning if you’re really looking for a ragchew.
Evaluate on-the-air technique as you tune across the bands. Consider what
you like and dislike about the various styles. Take what you like and try to
make it better — that’s the amateur way.

Sharing a ragchew
Hams come from all walks of life and have all kinds of personalities, of
course, so you come across the garrulous, for whom a ragchew that doesn’t
last an hour is too short, and the mike-shy ham that considers more than a
signal report to be a ragchew. Relax and enjoy the different people you meet!
Round tables are also great ways to have a ragchew. These are contacts
between three or more hams on a single frequency. Imagine getting together
with your friends for lunch. If only one of you could talk at a time, that’s a
round table! These aren’t formal, like nets, and generally just go “around the
circle” with each station talking in turn. Stations can sign off and join in at
any time.
Pounding Brass — Morse Code
CW is a lot easier to learn and copy if you are equipped to listen to it properly.
For starters, using headphones (cans) really helps because they block out dis-
tracting noise. When you are copying code, your brain evaluates every little
bit of sound your ears receive, so make its job easier by limiting the non-code
sounds. Warning: Settling on one preferred pitch for the tones is natural, but
over long periods of time, you can “wear out” your ear at this pitch. Keep the
volume down and try different pitches so you don’t fatigue your hearing.
When you have a comfortable audio environment, be sure your radio is set
up properly, too. Most radios come with a receiving filter intended for use
with voice signals. Typically, a voice filter is 2.4 kHz wide (meaning that it
passes a portion of radio spectrum or audio that spans 2.4 kHz) to pass the
human voice clearly. CW doesn’t need all that bandwidth. A filter 500 Hz wide
is a better choice and you can purchase one as an accessory whether your
radio is new or used. The narrower filter removes nearby signals and noise
that interfere with the desired signal. In fact, four or five code signals can
happily coexist in the bandwidth occupied by a single voice signal!
Narrower is not necessarily better below 400–500 Hz. A very narrow filter,
such as 250 Hz models, may allow you to slice your radio’s view of the spec-
trum very thin, but the tradeoff is an un-natural ringy sound to the signal. You
are less able to hear what’s going on around your frequency. These extra-
narrow filters are useful when interference or noise is severe, but use a wider
filter for regular use.
Be sure to read through your radio’s operating manual sections on CW
operation. Find out how to use all of the filter adjustment controls, such as
the IF Shift and Passband Tuning controls. Most CW operators like to set the
137
Chapter 9: Casual Operating

AGC control to the FAST setting, so that the radio receiver recovers rapidly.
Being able to get the most out of your receiver is just as important on CW as
when using voice.
If your radio has the ability to switch rapidly between transmit and receive,
then the full-breakin mode (or QSK) is something you’ll want to try. In this
mode, you can hear what’s happening on the band between the dits and
dahs. You have to turn off VOX operation that holds the radio in transmit.
Copying the code
To get really comfortable with CW, you need to copy in your head. Watching
a good operator having a conversation without writing down a word is an
eye-opener. How do they do that? The answer is practice.
As your code speed increases during the learning process, you gradually
achieve the ability to process whole groups of characters as one group of
sound. Copying in your head just takes that to another level. To get there,
spend some time just listening to code on the air without writing anything
down. Without the need to respond to the sender, you can relax and not get
all tensed up trying not to miss a character. Soon, you can hold more and
more of the contact in your head without diminishing your copying ability.
When you try it for real, use a piece of paper; not to write down all the char-
acters, but to jot down topics and information for your part of the next trans-
mission. Resist the temptation to write each letter on the paper. Soon you’re
ready for the next step, copying behind.
Read some more mail on the bands, trying to relax as much as possible with-
out staying right up with each character. Don’t force the meaning and let your
brain give it to you when it’s ready. Gradually the meaning pops into your
head farther and farther behind the characters as they’re actually received.
What’s happening is that your brain is doing its own form of error correcting,
making sure that what you copy makes sense and taking cues from previous
words and characters to fill in any blanks.
Good copying ability sneaks up on you over time. When you really hit a
groove, you’re barely conscious of the copying process at all and, voila!,
CW is your second language.
Sending Morse
You may think that sending ability automatically follows receiving ability. To
some extent, that’s true, but after listening to other operators on the air,
138
Part III: Hamming It Up 

you’ll find a wide range of sending ability. Having a good, smooth sending
style, or fist, is not hard.
First decide what type of device you want to use to send code. The basic tele-
graph key or straight key seen in Figure 9-6 is heard on the bands every day,
but sending good code at high speed with one is challenging. The straight key
tops out somewhere between 20 and 30 words per minute (wpm). At these
speeds, sending becomes a full-body experience and you really have to be
skilled to make it sound good. The straight key has a few variants — the side-
swiper, for example, in which a keying lever is moved back and forth. Still,
manual keying on a sideswiper tops out around 30 wpm.
You can find several better options. Before the advent of inexpensive elec-
tronics, fast code was sent with an automatic key, now known as a bug, and
shown in the middle of Figure 9-6. They’re called bugs because the largest
manufacturer, Vibroplex (www.vibroplex.com), uses the lightning bug as its
symbol. A cautionary note: Bugs are rarely heard today, which makes their
rhythm unusual and hard to copy, especially in the fist of an unskilled opera-
tor. You still make the dashes manually by pressing the keying paddle to the
left, but dots are now made by a vibrating lever attached to a pair of contacts.
A weight sliding along the lever determines the speed of the dots. These
vibrating-lever contraptions have a distinctive sound all their own, a synco-
pation known as swing.
As vacuum tubes miniaturized and transistors came on the scene in the 
mid-1960s, electronic keyers were created. These devices generate dots and
dashes electronically, when a dot contact or dash contact is closed for as
long as the contact stays closed. The simplest electronic keyers only make
strings of dits and dahs and the operator puts them together with the right
timing. More sophisticated keyers make sure that the spacing between dits
and dahs is correct and can even send alternating dits and dahs if both con-
tacts are closed at the same time. These keyers are called iambic keyers
because of the didahdidahdidah pattern they make. Because of the way
Morse characters are constructed, a skilled keyer makes fewer hand move-
ments using an iambic keyer. The devices used to send code with keyers are
called paddles (shown in Figure 9-6) after the flat ovals touched by the opera-
tor. A good operator can send well over 60 wpm with an electronic keyer
and comfortable paddle!
Collectors of Morse code equipment extend far beyond the ham radio com-
munity. Railroad and telegraph aficionados have terrific collections of old
keys, bugs, and paddles. For an entry into the world of antique code, start at
the Sparks Telegraph Key Review (www.zianet.com/sparks). Morse Express
Books (www.mtechnologies.com/books) publishes excellent books about
keys and related equipment.
139
Chapter 9: Casual Operating

Straight Key Night is a fun event that brings out old and new code equipment
(and operators) around the world . Every year on New Year’s Eve, hams break
out their straight keys and bugs and return to the airwaves for a few old-time
QSOs before heading off to the evening’s frivolities. Auld lang syne and all
that, you know! An award is given for Best Fist, too. Give it a try this year!
Code by computer
A number of programs use a computer’s sound card to extract characters
from the code. Some of them can even copy more than one code stream at a
time! (Computers can go fast, but in the presence of noise or interference, a
human is still much better at copying.) Keying is done by a transistor inter-
face to the computer’s serial or parallel port. Personally, I prefer to send and
copy the code myself, but can’t begin to approach the speed at which com-
puters can handle Samuel’s invention. Review the list of Morse programs at
www.ac6v.com/morseprograms.htm to find a program to try out.

Making and responding
to Morse code calls
On the HF bands, you can always find code on the lower frequencies of the
band, even on bands not divided between code and non-code modes. The
faster operators tend to be at the very bottom of the bands, with average
code speed slowly dropping as you tune higher.
As you start, find an operator sending code at a speed you feel comfortable
receiving. Even though no new Novice licenses are being granted, a number
of slow-speed code operators are in the Novice sub-bands 3.675 to 3.725,
7.100 to 7.150, 21.100 to 21.200, and 28.100 to 28.300 MHz. Medium-speed
QSOs are the norm elsewhere; even mixed in with high-speed operators down
low in the band.
When sending a Morse code CQ (a general way to solicit a contact), don’t
send faster than you can receive. Having to ask the responding station to QRS
(slow down) because you hustled through your CQ is embarrassing.
The best CQ is one that’s long enough to attract the attention of a station
tuning by, but not so long that that station loses interest and tunes away
again. I have good luck with 3-by-2-by-3 CQs (CQ CQ CQ de NØAX NØAX,
repeated three times) on average. If the band is very quiet, you may want to
send longer and a busy band may only require a 2-by-2-by-2 CQ. You just have
to try different styles until you get a feel for what works.
If your radio has the ability to listen between the dits and dahs (your operat-
ing manual calls this the Break-in, or QSK, feature), use it to listen for a sta-
tion sending “dits” on your frequency. That means, “I hear you, so stop CQing
and let me call!” You can then finish up with “DE [your call] K” and the other
station can call right away.
Making Morse code contacts (CW)
Making code contacts, or CW, is a lot like making voice contacts in terms of
structure. Hams are hams, after all. What’s different about the Morse code
contact is the heavy use of abbreviations, shorthand, and prosigns (two-letter
combinations used to control the flow of a contact) to cut down the number
of characters you send. Find a complete list of CW abbreviations and
prosigns at ac6v.com/morseaids.htm.
141
Chapter 9: Casual Operating

After you begin a contact and exchange call signs, including your call sign
every time you turn the transmission over to the other station is not neces-
sary, but you must include it once every ten minutes as required by FCC
rules. Send your information and end with the BK prosign to signal the other
station that he or she can go ahead. This method is much more efficient than
sending call signs every time.
At the conclusion of a Morse code contact, after all the 73s (Best Regards)
and CULs (See You Later), be sure to close with the appropriate prosign: SK
for end of contact or CL if you’re going off the air. You may also hear the
other station send “shave and haircut” (dit-dididit-dit) and you are expected
to respond with “two bits” (dit dit). These rhythms are deeply ingrained in
ham radio and are even heard in spoken conversations between hams. I wrap
up many a chat with “diddly bump-de-bump,” the rhythm of SK, or just a
“dit dit” meaning, “See ya!” Yeah, it’s a little goofy, but have fun!
Morse code (CW) clubs
After you master Morse code, it stays with you forever and you may find it
the most pleasurable way of making contacts. A number of groups for Morse
code buffs are around the world. FISTS (www.fists.org), the International
Morse Preservation Society, has chapters around the world and is the largest
organization dedicated to Morse code. The British club First Class CW
Operator’s Club (www.firstclasscw.org.uk), or FOC, is quite exclusive
with only 500 active members at any given time, but is quite active. Enter
CW Club into an Internet search engine to find other smaller CW clubs.
Receiving Messages Afloat and Remote
Once upon a time, any kind of messaging capability was tied to specific
phone numbers, bulletin boards, and servers. If you weren’t in range of your
home bulletin board or service provider, then you were pretty much discon-
nected. Ham radio has left those days behind, just like wireless networks
have freed up the computer user.
Hams can use a computer and a radio to connect directly to gateway stations
around the world by terrestrial links on the HF bands, or by VHF and UHF to
the amateur satellites. The gateway stations transfer e-mail messages between
ham radio and the Internet. The satellites transfer messages to and from the
142
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Internet via a ground control station. Either way, a ham far from home can
use ham radio to send and receive e-mail.
The best-known HF message system is Winlink 2000 (www.winlink.org),
which enables anyone with a Windows-based computer to send and receive
e-mail over ham radio links using the PACTOR or PACTOR II digital modes
(I cover digital modes in Chapter 11). A worldwide network of stations,
shown in Figure 9-7, operates on the 80, 40, 30, and 20 meter bands as well
as VHF packet. To find the frequencies for these stations, click the Winlink
Stations link on the Winlink home page. This extensive and growing network
covers much of Earth for most propagation conditions. These stations are
linked via the Internet, creating a global home for Winlink users.
To use the Winlink 2000 system, you first must register as a user on the
Winlink network so that the system recognizes you when you connect. As a
recognized user, your messages are available from anywhere on Earth, via
whichever Winlink station you use to connect. You must also download and
install a Winlink-compatible e-mail program, such as AirMail, which is avail-
able via the Winlink Web site.
Along with a computer that runs the e-mail software, you also need a sound
card and software to send and receive PACTOR data or an external commu-
nications processor that can run PACTOR or PACTOR II. Your HF or VHF radio
connects to the Winlink station.

stations.
143
Chapter 9: Casual Operating

If you are using AirMail, the connection process is straightforward. Follow
these steps to connect:
1. Open the AirMail program.
2. Click the Terminal icon.
A menu of WinLink stations and frequencies pops up.
3. Select a station and frequency appropriate for your location, time of
day, and equipment.
The computer and radio attempts to connect to the WinLink server and
notifies you of success or failure. This process is very much like a modem
connecting to a remote server for a dialup connection.
After you connect to the Winlink 2000 system, your messages are available
anywhere. The data rate is limited due to the radio link, so don’t try to send
big files, but text messages go through just fine.
The usual regulations for ham radio messages apply, of course; you cannot
encrypt messages, send business traffic and obscene content, or use radio
links on behalf of third parties in countries where such use is prohibited. Also
keep in mind that while the Winlink stations are connected via the Internet,
your station is connected by a relatively slow digital data radio link. Avoid
large files and messages. Nevertheless, Winlink 2000 is a tremendous service
and a boon to those who travel off the beaten track.

A
s your experience with ham radio grows, you’ll find more and more
practical uses for your communications skills. Your ham radio skills can
also benefit others, which is where the service part of Amateur Radio Service
comes in.
In return for the privileges that go with the license — access to a broad range
of frequencies, protection from many forms of interference, maintenance of
technical standards, and enforcement of operating rules — the Amateur
Service gives back by providing emergency communications systems and
trained operators. In between emergencies, hams also provide communica-
tions support at public functions and sporting events, keep an eye on the
weather, and perform training exercises. And hams have an extensive mes-
sage handling network that runs every day of the year for both emergency
and ordinary messages.
These services are important to you for two reasons: You can use them and
you can provide them. In this chapter, you find out what those services are and
how to get started with the groups that provide them. This chapter is written
primarily for American and Canadian hams and describes the U.S. emergency
communications organizations. Elsewhere around the world, you can find simi-
lar organizations to varying degrees. Contact your national amateur radio soci-
ety for information about them.

Joining an Emergency Organization
As I discuss at the beginning of Part II, the very first item in the list that
describes the basis and purpose of the Amateur Service is emergency com-
munications. As I write this (October 2003), other hams are putting their
skills to work helping fight the Southern California wildfires. Over the course
of this year, hams have been called to action as a consequence of severe
weather, fires, earthquakes, and even to assist with debris collection from the
breakup of the Space Shuttle, Columbia. You never know when an emergency
will arise, so start preparing yourself as soon as you’re licensed.
Known in the radio biz as emcomm, emergency communications is loosely
defined as any communication with the purpose of reducing an immediate
threat of injury or property damage. This definition covers everything from
reporting car accidents to supporting large-scale disaster relief. In this sec-
tion, I introduce you to the elements of emcomm and show you where to find
the necessary information to get started.
Regardless of whether your interest in emcomm is to support you and your
family or to participate in organized emcomm, you need to know how ama-
teurs are organized. Otherwise, how do you know where to tune or how to
interact with them? That’s where the ARRL’s Field Organization comes in.
While other local and regional amateur emcomm organizations are certainly
active, the Field Organization’s Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) is
the largest nationwide ham radio emcomm organization. Like the rest of the
ARRL membership, ARES is organized by individual ARRL sections that may
be an entire state or as small as a few counties, depending on population. For
complete information about the ARES, find the Public Service Communications
Manual online at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/pscm.
The ARES and Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES), organized
and managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), are
national emergency communications organizations that provide communica-
tions assistance to public and private agencies during a civil emergency or
disaster. They’re open to any amateur and welcome your participation.
If you want to help administer and manage emcomm activities in your ARRL
section after you have some ham radio experience, consider applying for an
ARRL Field Organization appointment. Volunteers fulfill the following positions:
 Assistant Section Manager (ASM): Section managers are appointed, but
you can always assist him or her. Tasks vary according to the activities
of the section, but collecting and analyzing volunteer reports or working
with and checking into local and regional nets are typical duties. Should
a special task arise, you may be asked to take it on behalf of the Section
Manager.
146
Part III: Hamming It Up 

 Official Emergency Stations (OES): Perform specific actions as required
by your local Emergency Coordinators. OES appointments are for stations
committed to emcomm work and provide the opportunity to tackle
detailed projects in operations, administration, or logistics.
 Public Information Officer (PIO): You can establish relationships with
local and regional media in order to publicize ham radio, particularly 
the public service and emcomm performed on behalf of the public. PIOs
also help establish good relationships with community leaders and 
organizations.
 Official Observer (OO): OOs help other hams avoid receiving an FCC
notice of rule violation because of operating or technical irregularities.
They also keep an ear out for unlicensed intruders or spurious transmis-
sions from other services.
 Technical Specialist (TS): If you have expertise in a specific area or if
you are generally skilled in some aspect of radio operations, you can be
a Technical Specialist. The TS serves as a consultant to local and regional
hams, as well as to the ARRL.
Check out the other interesting appointments at both the section and divi-
sion level at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/org.
ARES and RACES
Why have two different organizations? Aren’t they doing the same thing? Yes
and no. The different levels of emergencies and disasters, with varying degrees
of resource requirements, require different responses by government agencies.
As a result, a single, one-size-fits-all amateur emergency organization is not
enough to handle all emergencies.
The Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) is managed by the ARRL Field
Organization and works primarily with local public safety and non-governmental
agencies, such as the Red Cross. Local ARES leadership determines how best
to organize the volunteers and interact with the agencies they serve. Training
is arranged by the ARES teams and local organizations.
You can register as an ARES volunteer by simply filling out an ARRL form (www.
arrl.org/FandES/field/forms/fsd98.pdf) and mailing it to the ARRL.
However, you also need to join a local ARES team to actually participate in
training and exercises. The easiest way to find out about the ARES organization
in your area is to contact your ARRL Division’s Section Manager (SM) listed 
at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/org/smlist.html. You can also search
the ARRL Net Web site at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/nets/client/
netsearch.html and find ARES nets in your area. Check in to the net as a
visitor and ask for information about ARES in your area.
147
Chapter 10: Operating with Intent

The Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES), founded as a Civil Defense
support organization, is sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and is governed by special FCC rules. RACES is organized 
and managed by a local, county, or state civil defense agency responsible for
disaster services and activated during civil emergencies by state or federal
officials. RACES members are also required to be members of the local civil-
preparedness group and receive training to support that group. More infor-
mation on RACES is available at www.races.net.
To join RACES or find out more about RACES in your area, search your state
government’s Web site for Auxiliary Communications Service, also known as
ACS. The local ACS coordinator is the person you need to contact about
RACES membership. If you can’t locate this information on your state’s Web
site, a different government agency may manage it. Enter your state’s name
along with Auxiliary Communications Service into a Web search engine and
look for links that lead to emergency management sites.
I recommend that you start by participating in ARES. If you like being an ARES
member, then dual membership in both ARES and RACES may be for you.

Part III: Hamming It Up 
Military Affiliate Radio Services (MARS)
A third organization that maintains an extensive
emergency communications network of ham
volunteers is Military Affiliate Radio Services
(MARS), which provides an interface between
the worldwide military communications sys-
tems and ham radio. MARS is sponsored by the
Department of Defense, but each branch of the
military has its own MARS program.
MARS members receive special licenses and
call signs that allow them to operate on certain
MARS frequencies just outside the ham bands.
MARS provides technical and operations train-
ing, as well as preparation for emergency com-
munications. MARS volunteers handle many
personal messages from military personnel and
provide phone patches, or connections between
radios and the phone system, to their families
while they are deployed away from home.
To be a MARS volunteer, you must be at least 18
years old, be a U.S. citizen, and hold a valid
amateur license. For more information on each
of the MARS programs, including information
about how to apply for membership, see the fol-
lowing Web sites:

Preparing for an Emergency
Getting acquainted with emergency organizations is fine, but it’s only a start.
You need to take the necessary steps to prepare yourself so that when the
time comes, you are ready to contribute. There are four parts to being pre-
pared. You must know who, where, what, and how.
Knowing who
I discuss in the previous section the organizations that perform emergency
communications. After you become familiar with the leadership in your ARRL
section, you also need to get acquainted with the local team leaders and mem-
bers. The call signs of the local clubs and stations operating from governmen-
tal Emergency Operations Centers (EOC) are valuable to have at your fingertips
in times of emergencies.
The best way to make these call signs familiar to you (and yours to them) is to
become a regular participant in nets and exercises. Checking into weekly nets
takes little time and reinforces your awareness of who else in your area is par-
ticipating. If you have the time, attending meetings and other functions such
as EOC open houses or work parties also helps put a face with the call signs.
Building personal relationships pays off when a real emergency comes along.
Knowing where
When an emergency occurs, you don’t want to be left tuning around the bands
trying to find out where emcomm is going on! Keep a detailed reference that
lists the emergency net frequencies along with the names of the leaders in your
area (I provide a chart for you to fill in on the Cheat Sheet). You may even wish
to reduce this list with a photocopier and laminate it for a long-lasting reference
the size of a credit card that you can carry in your wallet or purse.
Knowing what
You don’t want to be running around trying to get your gear together in an
emergency. If an emergency occurs and your equipment is not ready, you can
be under tremendous pressure. In your haste, you either omit some crucial
item or can’t find it on the spur of the moment. I recommend a Go Kit (similar
to a first aid kit) as an antidote to this adrenaline-induced confusion.
149
Chapter 10: Operating with Intent

Before making up your Go Kit, consider what mission or missions you may 
be attempting. A personal checklist is a good starting point for your plans. A
good generic checklist is available in the ARES Field Resources Manual, which
you can download at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/aresman.pdf. Figure 10-1
shows an example of a portable Go Kit.
A Go Kit is a group of items necessary to you in an emergency that you col-
lect in advance of any such emergency and place in a handy carrying case. If
an emergency situation actually arises, the Go Kit allows you to spend your
time actually responding to the emergency instead of wracking your brain
trying to get your things together on the spur of the moment. By preparing
the kit in advance, you are less likely to forget important elements.
What should you put in your Go Kit? Well, of course, answers vary from ham
to ham, but your Go Kit should at least contain the following essentials:
 Food, particularly the kind not requiring refrigeration: You never know
when your next meal will arrive in an emergency. Remove the uncertainty
and bring along your own.
 Clothing appropriate to the emergency you’re responding to: If you get
too cold, you want a jacket nearby; too hot and you can exchange your
current clothing for something lighter. Preparation allows flexibility.
Figure 10-1:
A Go Kit.
150
Part III: Hamming It Up 

 Radios and equipment: Don’t forget to bring everything you may need:
radios, antennas, and power supplies. Make sure they’re lightweight,
flexible, and easy to set up.
 References: You need lists of operating frequencies as well as phone
lists — a personal phone list and a list of emergency-related telephone
numbers.
If you operate from home, no Go Kit is required, but you still need to prepare
for emergencies — such as if the lights go out for an extended period or your
main antenna goes down.
Your primary concern at home is emergency power. Most modern radios are
not very battery friendly, drawing more than an amp even when just receiv-
ing. You need a generator to power them for any period of time. If you have a
home generator, make sure it can be connected to power the AC circuits in
your radio shack.
If you don’t have a generator, you may be able to use another backup power
source: Most radios with a DC power supply can run from an automobile.
However, getting power from your car to your radio is not always easy. Decide
which radios you want to operate from your car and investigate how you can
power and connect an antenna to each of them.
Overall, the most important step is to simply consider and attempt to imple-
ment the answer to the question: “How would I get on the air if I’m unable to
use my regular shack?” Just by thinking things through and making plans,
you’re on the road to being prepared in an emergency.
Knowing how
Knowing the procedures to take is the most important part of personal pre-
paredness. No matter what your experience and background, the specifics of
working with your emergency organizations must be personally learned. If
they are not, you won’t be prepared to contribute when you show up on the
air from home or at a disaster site.
Do everyone a favor, including yourself, by spending a little time getting
trained in the necessary procedure and techniques. Your local emcomm
organization has plenty of training opportunities. You can check into the
local NTS and emcomm nets for practice. Participating in public service
activities, such as acting as a race course checkpoint in a fun run or as a
parade coordinator, is awfully good practice and exercises your radio
equipment, as well. By the way, you make good friends at these exercises
who can teach you a lot!
151
Chapter 10: Operating with Intent

The ARRL has also created a series of Emergency Communications training
courses that you can take online. The courses require a tuition fee, but as of
October 2003, because of government and private grants, students who com-
plete the course successfully are also reimbursed for their tuition 100 percent.
Check out the courses at www.arrl.org/cce.
After you start in emergency communications training, you will find that
training is available for many other useful skills you can learn: CPR, first aid,
orienteering, and search and rescue are just a few activities with active ama-
teur involvement.
Operating in an Emergency
You hope it never happens, but what if worse comes to worst? All emergen-
cies are different, of course, so a step-by-step procedure is not going to be
very useful. Here are some solid principles to follow instead, based on the
ARES Field Resources Manual.
When disaster strikes, do the following:
1. Check that you and your family and your property are safe and
secure before you respond as an emcomm volunteer.
2. Monitor your primary emergency frequencies.
3. Follow the instructions you receive from the net control or other
emergency official on the frequency.
Check in if and when check-ins are requested.
4. Contact your local emergency communications leader or designee for
further instructions.
Everyone is likely to be fairly excited and tense. Keep your head on straight
and follow your training so that you can help rather than hinder in an emer-
gency situation.
Reporting an accident or other incident
Reporting an accident is more common than you may think. Anybody who
spends time driving can attest to the frequency of accidents. I personally 
use ham radio to report accidents, stalled cars, and fires. Don’t assume that
people with cellphones are doing it. Know how to report an incident quickly
and clearly.
152
Part III: Hamming It Up 

When you have an emergency situation to report, follow these steps if your
radio has an autopatch:
1. Turn up your radio’s power to the limit and clearly say, “Break” or
“Break Emergency” at the first opportunity.
If one station is weak, a stronger signal can get the attention of listening
stations. Don’t shy away from interrupting an ongoing conversation.
2. After you have control of the repeater or the frequency is clear, state
that you have an emergency to report.
3. State clearly that you are making an emergency autopatch and then
activate the autopatch system.
If you can not activate the repeater’s autopatch, you may ask another
repeater user to activate it for you. Or, on HF or VHF, you can ask for some-
one to make an emergency relay to 911. In this case, report all the neces-
sary material and then stand by on frequency until the relaying station
reports to you that the information is relayed and the call is complete.
See Chapter 9 to find out how to activate your radio’s autopatch feature.
4. Dial 911 and when the operator responds, state your name and that
you are reporting an emergency via amateur radio.
5. Follow the directions of the operator from there.
If the operator asks you to stay on the line, do so and ask the other
repeater users to please stand by.
6. When the operator finishes, release the autopatch and announce that
you released the autopatch.
Whether you use a repeater’s autopatch feature or relay the report by another
repeater user, you need to be able to generate clear, concise information. To
report an automobile accident, for example, you should know:
 The highway number or street
 The address or approximate mile marker of the highway
 The direction or lanes the accident occurred
 Whether the accident is blocking traffic
 If injuries are apparent
 If the vehicles are on fire, are smoking, or have spilled fuel
Similarly for fires and other hazards, the dispatcher wants to know where it is
and how serious it appears. Don’t guess if you don’t know for sure! Report
what you know, but don’t embellish the facts.

Chapter 10: Operating with Intent

Making and responding to distress calls
Before an emergency occurs, be sure you know how to make a distress call
on a frequency where hams are likely to be listening, such as a marine ser-
vice net or a wide-coverage repeater frequency. Store at least one of these fre-
quencies in your radio’s memories, if possible. Anyone, licensed or not, can
use your radio equipment in an emergency to call for help on any frequency.
You won’t have time to be looking at net directories in an emergency. Do the
following things when you make a distress call.
 If you need immediate emergency assistance, the appropriate voice
signal is MAYDAY and the appropriate Morse code signal is SOS (yes,
just like in the movies).
Maydays sound something like: “MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY, this is
NØAX,” followed by:
• Your location (latitude/longitude) or address of the emergency
• The nature of the emergency
• What type of assistance you need — such as medical or trans-
portation aid
 Repeat your distress signal and your call sign for several minutes or
until you get an answer. Even if you don’t hear an answer, others may
hear you.
 Try different frequencies if you do not get an answer. If you do decide
to change frequencies, announce to what frequency you are moving so
that anyone hearing you can follow.
If you hear a distress signal on the air:
 Immediately find something to record information. Note the time and
frequency of the call. To help the authorities render assistance as quickly
as possible, note the following information:
• The location (latitude/longitude) or address of the emergency
• The nature of the problem
• What type of assistance he or she needs — such as medical or
transportation aid
• Any other information that is helpful
 Respond to the call. Say “[Give the station’s call sign], this is [your call
sign]. I hear your distress call. What is your situation?”
154
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Using Morse code, you send “[station’s call sign] DE [your call] RRR WAT
UR INFO?” or something similar. Let the station in distress know who
you are and that you hear them.
 After you acquire the information, ask the station in distress to remain
on frequency.
 Call the appropriate public agency or public emergency number, such
as 911. Explain that you are an amateur radio operator and that you
received a distress call.
The dispatcher either begins a process of asking you for information or
transfers you to a more appropriate agency.
Follow the dispatcher’s instructions to the letter. The dispatcher may
ask you to act as a relay to the station in distress.
 As soon as possible, report back to the station in distress. Tell them
who you contacted and any information you have been asked to relay.
 Stay on frequency as long as the station in distress or the authorities
need your assistance.
Supporting emergency communications
outside your area
What do you do in case of a disaster or emergency situation outside of your
immediate vicinity? How can you be of assistance? The best thing you can do
is make yourself available to the on-site communications workers, but only if
called upon to do so. Because most of the important information from a dis-
aster flows out, not in, you don’t want to get in the way.
For example, if a hurricane is bearing down on Miami, getting on the air and
calling, “CQ Miami!” is foolish. The chance you have of actually rendering assis-
tance are minimal and you stand a chance of diverting some actual emergency
need from the proper authorities. Instead, support the communications net-
works that the Miami hams depend on. Check in to your NTS local nets to see if
any messages need relayed to your location. Monitor the Hurricane Watch Net
on 14.325 MHz and any Florida emergency net frequencies. Tune to the bands
that support propagation to Florida, in case someone is calling for help.
Here’s another example — say a search-and-rescue (SAR) operation in the
nearby foothills is taking place with nets on 2-meter repeaters and several sim-
plex frequencies coordinating the activities. Do you check into the SAR nets?
No! But you can monitor (listening without transmitting) their operation to
see if an opportunity arises for you to provide assistance, especially if you
155
Chapter 10: Operating with Intent

have beam antennas that you can aim directly at the area. (See Chapter 13 for
more on antennas.) If you can set your radios to listen to the repeater input
frequencies as well as the outputs, you may hear a weak station unable to
activate the repeater. If you monitor the simplex frequencies, you may act as
a relay station. Two stations in hilly areas may be unable to communicate
directly but you can hear both and can relay communications. If such a situa-
tion occurs, you can break in and say, “This is [your call sign] and I can copy
both stations. Do you want me to relay?”
You need to help information flow out from the disaster site, not force more
in. Listen, listen, listen. That’s good advice most of the time.
Providing Public Service
In between emergencies, hams perform other valuable public service in many
ways. After you become associated with a local emergency communications
group, you can use your ham radio skills in many opportunities for the public’s
benefit.
Weather monitoring
One of the most widespread public service functions is that of the amateur
weather watcher. In many areas, particularly with frequent severe weather
conditions, nets devoted to reporting local weather conditions meet regu-
larly. Some nets meet once or twice every day and others only when there is
a threat of severe weather.
Many weather nets are associated with the NOAA SKYWARN program (www.
skywarn.org). Groups reporting weather conditions under the SKYWARN
program feed information to the National Weather Service (NWS), which uses
the reports in forecasting and severe weather management. In some areas, a
net control station may operate a station from the NWS itself. For information
on whether a SKYWARN net is active in your area, follow the Local Skywarn
Groups link on the SKYWARN home page or enter SKYWARN net into an
Internet search engine.
Other weather nets may operate on VHF/UHF repeaters or on 75-meter voice
nets. For example, the New England Weather Net meets on 3905 kHz every day
at 1030Z. Informal weather nets on local repeaters are common. Ask around
to see if one operates in your area. They are usually active at commuting
drive times.
156
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Parades and sporting events
Amateurs participate in parades and sporting events to provide the event man-
agers with timely information and coordination. In return, amateurs get good
training in communications procedures and operations that simulate real-life
emergencies. For example, you can think of a parade as similar to a slow-speed
evacuation. A lost-child booth at a parade is similar to a small search-and-
rescue operation. Helping keep track of race entrants in a marathon is good
practice for handling health-and-welfare messages.
A lead representative of the amateur group usually coordinates plans with
the event management. The group then deploys whatever the plan requires.
Depending on the size of the event, all communications may take place on
one simplex frequency or several may be required. Information may be
restricted to simple status or actual logistics information may be relayed.
Communications support includes a wide variety of needs.
Event managers typically work with a single club or emergency services group
that manages the ham radio side of things. If you want to participate in these
events, start by contacting your Section Manager. The SM directs you to one or
more individuals active in public service who can let you know about upcom-
ing events.
When you support an event, be sure to get the appropriate identification. Dress
similarly to the rest of the group and obtain any required insignia. Have a copy
of your amateur license and some photo ID. Make sure you take water and
some food with you in case you are stationed somewhere without support.
Don’t assume you’ll be out of the weather and protect yourself against the
elements. Have your identification permanently engraved or attached to your
radio equipment to protect against theft.
Operating on Nets
Nets are one of the oldest ham radio activities. The first net was probably
formed as soon as two hams were on the air! Nets are just regularly scheduled
on-the-air meetings of hams with common interests. Sometimes the interests
are strictly for pleasure, such as collecting things, playing radio chess, or pur-
suing the Worked All States awards. Other nets are more utilitarian, such as
those for traffic handling, emergency services, weather reporting, and so forth.
Nearly all nets have a similar basic structure. A Net Control Station (NCS) ini-
tiates the net operations, maintains order, directs the net activities, and then
terminates net operations in an orderly way. Stations wishing to participate
157
Chapter 10: Operating with Intent

in the net check in at the direction of the NCS. A net manager defines net policy
and focus, and works with the NCS stations to keep the net meeting on a reg-
ular basis.
Information, such as a formal radiogram or just a verbal message, is exchanged
during a net either on frequency or off frequency. Nets primarily for discussion
of a common interest or for selling and trading equipment tend to keep all the
transmissions on one frequency so that everyone can hear them. This system
is quite inefficient for a traffic handling or emergency net, so the NCS sends
stations off frequency to exchange the information and then return to the net
frequency.
Here’s an example of an NCS directing an off-frequency message exchange
during an NTS traffic-handling net:
W2—-: I have one piece of traffic (a single message) for Baltimore. (W2—-
either received the message on another net or can be the originating 
station.)
NCS: W2—- standby. K3—- can you take that traffic for Baltimore? (K3—-
registered earlier (checked in) with the NCS and reported his location as
somewhere near Baltimore.)
K3—-: I can take the Baltimore traffic. (K3—- accepts and delivers the mes-
sage to the addressee.)
NCS: W2—- and K3—- move 5 down and pass the traffic.
This transmission means W2—- and K3—- are to tune 5 kHz below the net fre-
quency, re-establish contact, and W2—- then transmits the message to K3—-.
When they are done, both return to the net frequency and report to the NCS.
K3—- may stay on frequency until the net finishes or may immediately leave
to deliver the message.
If you want to check in to a net, you register your call sign and location or
status with the NCS. Be sure you can hear the NCS clearly and that you can
understand his or her instructions. If you’re not a regular net member, wait
until the NCS calls for visitors. When you check in, give your call sign once,
phonetically if on phone. If the NCS doesn’t copy your call sign the first time,
repeat your call sign or the NCS requests a relay from one of the listening sta-
tions that may hear you.
You can check in with business (such as an announcement) or traffic (mes-
sages) for the net in a couple of ways — listen to the net to find out which is
the appropriate method. The most common method is to state when check-
ing in, “NØAX with one item for the net.” The NCS acknowledges your item and
158
Part III: Hamming It Up 

you then wait for further instructions. Or you can just check in with your call
sign and when the NCS acknowledges you and asks if you have any business
for the net, reply, “One item.” Listen to other net members checking in and
when in Rome, check in as the Romans do.
If you want to contact one of the other stations checking in, you can either
declare this intention when checking in as if it were net business or you can
wait until the check-in process is complete and the NCS calls for net business.
Either way, the NCS asks the other station to acknowledge you and puts the
two of you together following net procedures.
Nets are run using many different methods. Some methods are very formal
and others are more like an extended round-table QSO. The key is to listen,
identify the NCS, and follow the directions. The behavior of other net mem-
bers is your guide.
Handling Traffic
The National Traffic System (NTS), managed by the ARRL Field Organization,
is the backbone of all amateur message handling in North America. The NTS
runs every day, during emergencies and normal times alike. Traffic handling,
while less popular an activity than in years past, builds skilled and accurate
operating techniques, making you ready for any emergency.
159
Chapter 10: Operating with Intent
Is traffic handling still needed?
Does traffic handling sound sort of antique? 
It should, being one of the oldest activities in ham
radio. Why, in this age of wireless LANs and
coast-to-coast links, does traffic handling 
still exist? The main reason is that when all else
fails — and sophisticated communications sys-
tems such as cell phones and the Internet fail
quickly in a disaster or emergency — ham radio
traffic handlers fill the gap in an accurate and
accountable way until those faster systems are
brought back online. Under such circumstances,
large numbers of simple text messages must be
sent quickly and reliably. For example, health and
welfare messages stream in and out of the
afflicted areas until more sophisticated systems
are brought in or restored. Even when digital
means of transmission are available, the same
type of message structure is often employed
to make the process accountable and traceable
as good emergency management requires.
Remember: Traffic handling is supposed to work
in an emergency, when the chips are down and
only the barest minimum of resources may exist.

Traffic consists primarily of text messages in the form of radiograms that are
very similar to old-style telegrams. Each message is relayed from ham to ham
using time-tested procedures until the message reaches its destination where
it’s delivered by an appropriate method. For detailed information on traffic
handling, the ARRL Operating Manual has an extensive chapter on handling
traffic procedures and jargon.
Figure 10-2 shows how messages entering the NTS start with nets at the local
level and are then passed up to section, regional, and area nets. Wide-area nets
connect the various regions as the messages move closer to their destinations.
Moving back down the tree, the messages are delivered to section nets and
finally, local nets. These NTS nets are managed by a Section Traffic Manager
(STM) who is part of the ARRL Field Organization.
Handling traffic is an excellent way for young hams to gain experience and
take on responsibility. You don’t have to be a certain age, only have a desire
to perform well and pay attention to detail and procedure. You can partici-
pate no matter where you live and whether you have just an hour or two a
week or can check in twice a day. The more volunteers available, the better
the chances of being able to support emergency operations.
Visual or physical handicaps are no obstacle either. When I was active in
Missouri nets, blind ham Ruth KØONK was the top traffic handler in the state
month after month with hundreds of messages to her credit.
If you develop a taste for traffic handling, you can request that your Section
Manager appoint you as an Official Relay Station (ORS). The ORS appoint-
ment signifies that you’re developing your skills in traffic handling and can

use them to support your community in an emergency. You may choose to
specialize in traffic handling on one mode, become a net manager, or act as a
liaison between regions.
Getting started
If you decide to give traffic handling a try, your best bet is to find an NTS
local net in your area. Go to the ARRL Net Search Web page (www.arrl.org/
FandES/field/nets/client/netsearch.html), select the Local Nets radio
button, your state from the U.S. State drop-down list, and the National Traffic
Forwarding Nets Only option from the National Traffic Affiliated drop-down list.
You get a list of local nets in your state that handle traffic. Click the net name to
find out more about the net.
On this Web site, you can also find a number of training nets using both voice
and Morse code. Follow the same search process, but select the State Nets
radio button, select your state from the list, and enter Training in the Net
Name box. If you do not see any training nets for your state, search again with
the Net Name box blank and review the resulting list. If you are unsure of which
nets are suitable, click the link for the state emergency net and contact the net
manager listed there for advice. You can also contact your Section Manager —
follow the link for your section at www.arrl.org/sections/?sect=.
When you select a net, listen in for a session or two. Determine when they ask
for visitors and how member stations check in. After you understand the net
procedures, check in as a visitor and ask for an after-net contact with the NCS.
During that contact, you can ask for information about the net and whether
any net guidelines are available. Then start checking in on a regular basis.
Handling a piece of traffic
The magic day arrives and the NCS hooks you up with another station with a
radiogram for your town. Don’t be afraid to say, “This is my first message, please
take it slow.” An experienced traffic handler takes all the time you need to get
the job done right. To prepare for this day, download and review the radiogram
guidelines FSD-218 at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/forms (you need to
scroll down the page before you come across it).
If you have a pad of radiogram forms (shown in Figure 10-3), so much the
better, but they’re not required. The radiogram guidelines describe each bit
of information just as it comes in from the traffic system. All you have to do is
write down the information and follow the instructions.
161
Chapter 10: Operating with Intent

A radiogram consists of these parts:
 Preamble: The first batch of information you receive, the preamble is
information about the message — not the message itself. It describes the
nature and origin of the message so that you can handle it and reply, in
case you need to do so. The preamble improves the message accuracy.
 Addressee: Along with the name, the addressee information usually has
a street address and a telephone number. Some messages only have a
name, town, and telephone number. You deliver the message by telephone
or whatever means are available.
 Text message: Radiograms are intended to be 25 words or less, so you
don’t have to deal with a lot of text. Be sure you have the spelling correct
on any unusual words. The only punctuation you’re likely to encounter is
an X in place of a period and a ? at the end of a question. Don’t be con-
fused by the check of the message, which is just a count of word groups,
number groups, and mixed groups (letter-number combinations, such as
a serial number) in the text portion only. The check is to allow you to
count through the text and verify that you received the right amount of
information. Don’t be afraid to ask the transmitting station if you’re not
sure about counting the text’s elements.
The text may include something like ARL FORTY SIX. This text refers 
to ARRL Numbered Radiograms, which are special condensations of
common groups of words. ARL FORTY SIX (they’re always spelled out)
Figure 10-3:
An ARRL
radiogram
form with a
sample
message.
162
Part III: Hamming It Up 

means “Greetings on your birthday and best wishes for many more to
come.” These are quite a time saver! A complete list (FSD-3) is available
from the ARRL Field Organization Forms page (www.arrl.org/FandES/
field/forms).
 Signature: The name or identification of the message’s originator.
Take your time and carefully check the entire message to be sure you copied
it correctly. Check with the transmitting station if you have any questions.
When you’re sure, you can say, “QSL!” (meaning “received completely” with
pride and report back to the NCS.
Delivering the message
Delivering a message is a pretty easy part of traffic handling. All you have to
do is call the addressee and say, “Hello, my name is —-, I’m an amateur radio
operator and I have a message for you from —-.” You need to let them know
you’re not a telemarketer and that you have a message from someone they
are likely to know.
After your addressee is ready to receive the message, carefully read it back to
him or her (just the text, not the preamble or addressee). Convert any num-
bered radiogram to its equivalent text — even if you’re delivering the message
to another ham. When you’re done, be sure everything is okay and ask if he
or she has a reply.
If so, be sure to get the complete addressee information (be sure of the spelling)
and try to limit the response to 25 words or less. You can use the numbered
radiograms to save space, too. Note the local time and date when you accept
the message. Assign it a precedence, add any handling instructions (which
are optional), and count up the words.
After you write the message, take it back to the next net session and when
you check in, say “[your call] with one message!”
Sending a message
When you get back to the net and the NCS assigns you to a station that accepts
your traffic, ask for help in determining the message’s check, or word count (if
you need help). Tell the station the check you came up with and ask him or her
to help you confirm it. Before the message goes on its way, the check needs to
be correct or subsequent relaying stations will think an error is in the message
and it may come back to you.
163
Chapter 10: Operating with Intent

With the complete message ready to go, slowly read each portion of informa-
tion to the relaying station using the following steps:
1. Start with the preamble and then say, “Break for addressee.”
The relaying station either says “Go ahead” or asks for clarification
about some item in the preamble.
2. Read the addressee information and say, “Break for text.”
3. Read the text and signature and say, “End of Message.”
If the relaying station didn’t get the message all correct, he or she lets
you know and asks for a fill or repeat. For example, they may say, “All
after feldspar,” which means “Repeat everything after the word feldspar.”
Soon, the relaying station reports “QSL!” and you’ve done it!

fter you get rolling with casual operating, you can begin to explore a
whole world of interesting specialties within ham radio. Specialties, to
many, are the real attraction of the hobby.
In this chapter, I give you an overview of the most popular activities, cover
some of the basic techniques and resources, and demystify a little bit of the
specialized jargon ham radio seems to attract. I don’t hit all of the possible
activities by any means, but start with the activities I discuss in this chapter
and you’ll discover many others along the way, especially if you read the
magazines and browse the popular Web sites.
DX-ing
Right after traffic handling (Chapter 10), pushing your station to make con-
tacts over greater and greater distances (DX means distant stations) is the
second oldest activity in all of ham radio. Somewhere out in the ether, a sta-
tion is always just tantalizingly out of reach and the challenge of contacting
that station is the purpose of DX-ing.

Thousands of hams across the continents and around the world like nothing
better than to make contacts (QSOs) with someone far away. These hams
seem to ignore all nearby stations. Their logs are filled with exotic locations.
Ask them about some odd bit of geography and you are likely to find that
they not only know where it is, but some of its political history and the call
sign of at least one ham operator there. These hams are DXers.
The history of ham radio is tightly coupled to DX-ing. As transmitters became
more powerful and receivers more sensitive, the distances a station could
make contact were a direct measure of quality. Hams quickly explored the dif-
ferent bands and follow the fluctuations of the ionosphere. DX-ing drives
improvements in many types of equipment.
Today, intercontinental contacts on the HF frequencies traditionally consid-
ered to be the shortwave bands are common but still thrilling. Cross-conti-
nental contacts on VHF and UHF once thought impossible are made in
increasing numbers. Because the sun and the seasons are always changing,
each day you spend DX-ing is a little (and sometimes a lot) different. Sure,
you can log on to an Internet chat room or send e-mail around the world, but,
like fishing, logging a QSO in the log, mastering the vagaries of the ionos-
phere, and getting through to a distant station is a real accomplishment non-
hams can never know.
DX-ing on the shortwave bands
The following sections show you how to use the shortwave or HF bands to
“work DX.” These are the bands with frequencies below 30 MHz on which sig-
nals routinely travel all over the Earth, bouncing between the ionosphere and
the Earth’s surface as they go. The ease with which signals can be exchanged
between continents on the shortwave bands attracts many thousands of
adherents. Because the signals propagate so widely, HF DX-ing is often a
worldwide event with stations calling from several continents. VHF and UHF
DX-ing is no less exciting, but requires a different approach, which is covered
later. Propagation is much more selective, so fewer signals are heard at one
time and are usually from stations concentrated in a few areas. These differ-
ences make what is fundamentally the same pursuit — making contact as far
away as you can — quite different on the shortwave bands versus VHF
and UHF.
For more information on propagation I recommend checking out the technical
information available on the Ham Radio For Dummies Web site to find out how
the ionosphere affects long-haul contacts for HF, VHF, and UHF signals. In-depth
reading about shortwave DX-ing techniques can be found in The Complete DXer
by Bob Locher W9KNI (published by Idiom Press). Now in its third edition,
Bob’s book has Elmered legions of beginning DXers.

Part III: Hamming It Up 

Tuning for DX
Before starting out, you need to know that even if you have a very modest
home or mobile HF station, you can work DX. Skill and knowledge compensate
for a great deal of disparity in equipment. Nowhere is this concept more true
than in hunting the elusive DX. The first skill to learn is not how to transmit,
but how to listen.
When working DX, in all cases, start at the bottom of the band or as close as
your license privileges permit. As I discuss in Chapter 9, the best DX tends to
collect there. Stop at each signal along the way, even those that sound like
casual contacts, to determine who is on the air. Listen for obvious accents
and signals with a curious, hollow, or fluttery sound.
Signals coming from far away have to make several hops off the ionosphere —
sometimes as many as five or six! — to get to your antenna. These hops divide
the signal into multiple paths that have slightly different travel times. The
paths interfere with each other as they arrive at your antenna, smearing the
signal out in time and making its strength change rapidly. Learn to recognize
that sound because, for sure, it means DX is at hand!
Check the frequencies frequented by DX-peditions — trips lasting a few days
to exotic and desirable locations made specifically to activate (make contacts
from) them for DXers around the world. You can usually find these adventur-
ers on frequencies in the lower 25 kHz of the CW bands (the Extra Class seg-
ments) and at the high end of the Extra Class segments on phone. Common
frequencies include 3.795, 14.195, 21.295, and 28.495 MHz.
Program the popular DX frequencies into your rig’s memory for easy access.
Keep tuning and listening, noting what you hear and at what times. When DX-
ing, experience with the characteristics of a band’s propagation is the best
teacher. Try to detect a pattern when signals from the different population
centers appear and how the seasons affect propagation on the different bands.
Soon you recognize the signals of regulars on the band, too. As usual, the key
is to listen, listen, listen.
If you plan on doing a lot of DX-ing, purchase a copy of the ARRL DXCC List
(www.arrl.org/awards/dxcc) and a ham radio prefix map of the world for ref-
erence. These tools help you figure out what country corresponds to the call
signs you hear. You sometimes hear special or unusual call signs. With an ITU
prefix list, you can figure out those call signs’ countries of origin. A very detailed
prefix-country list is available online at www.ac6v.com/prefixes.htm#PRI.
While you’re collecting resources, here’s another suggestion: Centered on your
location, an azimuthal-equidistant or az-eq map, such as the one in Figure 11-1,
167
Chapter 11: Specialties

tells you what direction a signal’s coming from. Because signals travel along
the “Great Circle” paths between stations (imagine a string stretched tightly
over a globe between the stations), the path for any signal that you hear is
along the radial line from the middle of the map (your location) directly to the
other station. If the path goes the “long way around,” it goes off the edge of the
map (which is halfway around the world from your station) and reappears on
the other side. This is the “long path.” Most signal paths stay entirely on the
map because they take the “short path.” Some az-eq maps are available in the
ARRL Operating Manual and you can also generate one online from several
sources, including www.wm7d.net/azproj.shtml.
Daytime DX-ing
You must account for the fluctuations in the ionosphere when you’re DX-ing.
Depending on the hour, the ionosphere either absorbs a signal or reflects it over
the horizon. In the daytime, the 20, 17, 15, 12, and 10-meter bands, called the
High Bands, tend to be “open” (support propagation) to DX stations. Before day-
light, signals begin to appear from the east, beginning with 20-meters and pro-
gressing to the higher bands over a few hours. After sunset, the signals linger
from the south and west for several hours with the highest frequency bands
closing first in reverse order. Daytime DXers tend to follow the Maximum Use-
able Frequency (MUF), the highest signal the ionosphere reflects. These reflec-
tions are at a very low angle and so can travel the longest distance for a single
reflection (one reflection is called a hop) and have the highest signal strengths.

Nighttime DX-ing
From 30-meters down in frequency are the nighttime bands of 30, 40, 60, 80,
and 160-meters, known as the Low Bands. These bands are throttled during the
daytime hours by absorption in the lower layers of the ionosphere. After the
sun begins to set, these bands start to come alive. First, 30, 40, and 60-meters
may open in late afternoon and stay open somewhat after sunrise. 80 and 160-
meters, however, make fairly rapid transitions around dawn and dusk. Signals
between stations operating on 80 and 160-meters often exhibit a short (15 to 30
minute) peak in signal strength when the easternmost stations are close to sun-
rise. This is known as the dawn enhancement. This time is good for stations
with modest equipment to be on the air and take advantage of the stronger sig-
nals on these more difficult DX bands.
160-meters is known as Top Band because it has the longest wavelength of
any current amateur band. This long wavelength requires larger antennas.
Add in more atmospheric noise than at higher frequencies and you have a
challenging situation. That’s why some of the most experienced DXers love
Top Band DX-ing. Imagine trying to receive a 1 kilowatt broadcast station
halfway around the world. That’s what the Top Band DXer is after! As difficult
as this task sounds, many of the top DXers have managed it.
Contacting a DX station
Making a call to a DX station requires a little more attention to the clarity of
your speech and sending than making a call to a nearby ham. Remember:
Your signal likely has the same qualities as the DX station — hollow or flut-
tery and weak — so speak and send extra carefully. Give the DX station’s call
sign using the same phonetics they are using and then repeat yours at least
twice, using standard phonetics. On Morse code contacts, send the DX sta-
tion’s call sign once and your call sign two or three times at a speed matching
that of the DX station.
DX contacts, except when signals are quite strong, tend to be shorter than
contacts with nearby stations. When signals are very weak or a station very
rare, a contact may consist of nothing more than a confirmation that you
each have the call signs correct and a signal report as described in Chapter 8.
To confirm the contact, both you and the DX station must get each other’s
call signs correct. To do that, use standard phonetics (on voice transmissions),
speak clearly, and enunciate each word. New hams often don’t realize that
multiple hops and skips around the world have a pretty dramatic effect on
speech intelligibility, none of it for the better. Speak relatively slowly, don’t
slur your words or mumble, and keep your transmissions short.
When it’s time to conclude the contact, you need to let the other station know
if you will be sending a QSL card (these cards are commonly known as QSLs)
to confirm that the contact occurred. Collecting these cards, like those in
Figure 11-2, is a wonderful part of the hobby. See Chapter 14 for more info on
QSL cards.

Tracking the sun
Because the sun is so important in determining
what bands are open and in what direction, you
need to know what portions of the Earth are in
daylight and darkness. You can use a number of
tools to keep track of the sun. The very handy DX
Edge, once made by Xantek and currently only
available at hamfests and on the various used-
equipment-for-sale Web sites, is a pocket-sized
world map with sliding overlays that show the
light and dark areas of the Earth in different sea-
sons. Many DXers keep one at their elbow when
chasing DX. You can substitute the online gray
line map instead (found at dx.qsl.net/
propagation/greyline.html and shown
in the figure below). A useful standalone soft-
ware package that has many types and styles of
real-time world and regional maps is Geoclock
(home.att.net/~geoclock).

YOU DON’T NEED TO SHOUT INTO THE MICROPHONE! Shouting doesn’t
make you any louder at the other end! By adjusting your microphone gain
and speech processor, you can create a very understandable signal at normal
voice levels! Your contacts and family will thank you for doing so. Save the
shouting for celebrating your latest DX contact!
If you call and call and can’t get through or if the stations you contact ask for
a lot of repeats and fills (in other words, if they often ask you to repeat your-
self), you probably have poor audio quality. Have a nearby friend, such as a
club member, meet you on the air when the bands are quiet and do some
audio testing. Check to see if you have hum or noise on your audio. Noise is
often the result of a broken microphone cable connection, either in the
microphone itself or at the radio connector. You may not be able to tell you
have a problem from the radio’s power meter output, so an on-the-air check
is necessary to find it. Inexpensive, old, and non-communications micro-
phones (such as computer microphones) often have poor fidelity. If your on-
the-air friend says you sound like a bus station PA system, upgrade to a
better microphone!
Pileups
Aptly named, a pileup is just that: a pile of many signals trying to get through
to a single — often quite rare — station. Pileups can sound like a real mess, but
if you listen carefully, you’ll notice that some stations get right through. How
do they do this? They listen to the rare station’s operating procedure, find what
kind of signals the operator is listening for, and carefully time their call. If they
don’t get through the first time, they stop calling and listen until they have it
figured out. These smooth operators use their ears instead of their lungs or
amplifiers to get through. You can, too, by listening first and transmitting
second. Here are some common tricks to listen for and try yourself:
 Time your call a little bit differently than everybody else. Wait for a
second or two before beginning or wait for the short lull when most
have given their call once and are listening.
 Make your signal sound a little bit differently, higher or lower by offset-
ting the transmit frequency 200 or 300 hertz.
 Just give your call once or twice before listening for the DX station.
Some folks never seem to stop calling — how would they know if the DX
station did answer them?
 Use phonetics similar to others that have gotten through.
Try to figure out what the DX station hears well and try to do that.
171
Chapter 11: Specialties

Splits
The term split is used when a station is transmitting on one frequency, but lis-
tening on another. This procedure is common when many stations are trying
to get through to a single station, such as a rare DX station. You can tell that a
station is working split when you hear the station contacting other stations
but you can’t hear those stations’ responses. It can also work the other way
around: Sometimes you tune in a pileup of stations trying to contact a DX sta-
tion — but you aren’t able to hear the DX station’s responses. Typically, the
DX station’s split listening frequency is a few kHz above the transmitting fre-
quency. The station being called gives instructions such as “listening up two”
or “QRZed 14205 to 14210.” The former means he’s listening for stations 2 kHz
above his transmit frequency. The latter means he’s listening in the range
between the two frequencies, in this case probably 14.205 to 14.210 kHz.
To “work split,” set one of your radio’s main tuning controls (called VFOs,
which is an abbreviation of variable frequency oscillator) to the transmit fre-
quency and the other to the receive frequency. These are usually referred to
as “VFO A” and “VFO B.” Set up the radio to listen where one VFO is set and
transmit on the other. Read your rig’s manual carefully so that you can do
this properly. If you accidentally transmit on the wrong VFO, you interfere
with the DX station. This method is the easiest way of working split, but it’s
not the only one: You can also establish the transmit and receive frequencies
as memory selections on your radio, and then jump between memories.
Don’t bother trying to dial back and forth — you won’t be quick enough. With
either method, practice for a while first, before trying it out on the air.
Using (and abusing) DX spotting systems
DXers share the frequencies and call signs of DX stations they discover on the
air through an extensive, worldwide system of VHF packet radio networks and
Web pages. This system is called spotting, and the message that describes
where you can find the DX station is called a spot. The following is an example
from the popular Web site www.dxsummit.com:
W5VX 7003.7 A61AJ 0142 05 Nov
This spot means that W5VX is hearing A61AJ from the United Arab Emirates
(A6 is the prefix of call signs for amateurs in the UAE) on a frequency of
7003.7 kHz at 0142Z (01:42 AM in London) on November 5th.
If you live in any populated area of North America or Europe, you probably can
access one of the VHF packet radio DX spotting systems. If you have Internet
access, you can also log on to the DX spotting system Web sites using a
browser or by using TELNET (a text-only Internet communications program
included with most computer operating systems) to log on to local “packet
clusters,” which are linked to the VHF packet systems. (See the section
“Packet,” later in this chapter, for more on packet systems.) Numerous DX
Web sites and clusters are listed at http://www.ac6v.com/dxlinks.htm.
172
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Although jumping from spot to spot can be a lot of fun, maintaining your
tuning and listening skills is important. Be sure that you have the station’s
call sign correct before you put it in your log — contacting what you think is
a rare station, only to find out that due to a busted spot, your fabulous DX
contact wasn’t so fabulous after all, is a disappointment. Because spotted sta-
tions attract quite a crowd, working DX sometimes by not chasing the spot-
ted stations and tuning for them yourself may be easier. Don’t become
dependent on the spotting networks.
Getting awards
Many DX-ing award programs, and the most popular are listed in Table 11-1,
are suited to widely varying levels of interest. If you are just getting started,
the Worked All Continents (WAC) award is for you. What you need is a con-
tact with each of the six populated continents: Europe, Africa, Asia, North
and South America, and Oceania (islands in the South Pacific and Australia).
No matter where you live around the world, one continent remains aloof, tan-
talizing you until you break through and make the contact. The Worked All
States (WAS) program is popular both in and out of the Unites States and is a
great way to get used to hunting elusive contacts. My last state was Vermont.

Chapter 11: Specialties

The other awards in Table 11-1 are more challenging. For example, DXCC —
the undisputed leader of DX award programs — is awarded when the appli-
cant has confirmed contacts with 100 entities (countries, colonies, islands)
around the world. Because the awards are challenging, their achievement
does signify a worthwhile accomplishment. As a result, making contacts in
pursuit of the awards is a very popular segment of ham radio.
Most DX awards programs reward achievement in the same manner: First,
you must qualify for the basic award (100 entities, 100 islands, 300 prefixes,
and so on). You receive a certificate and your first endorsement (a sticker or
other adornment that signifies a specific level of achievement). From that
point, you can receive additional endorsements for higher levels of achieve-
ment: more contacts on one band, more contacts in one geographic region,
and so on. Because these levels of success are so open-ended, you can
achieve them all. (For more on awards, see the section “Chasing Awards,”
later in this chapter.)
DX-ing on the VHF/UHF bands
Although DX-ing on the traditional shortwave bands is very popular, an
active and growing community enjoys DX-ing on the bands above 30 MHz.
The excitement of extending your station’s capability to these bands is being
shared by more hams than ever before. The explosion in popularity of
VHF/UHF DX-ing is similar to the explosion of HF DX enthusiasm in the 1960s
when top-quality equipment became available to the average ham. These
days, the recent generation of all-band HF/VHF/UHF radio equipment puts
top-notch DX-ing on the shack desktop.
With the exception of the 6-meters band — known as the Magic Band
because of its sudden and dramatic openings where distant stations sud-
denly “appear” — these higher frequencies usually do not support the kind of 
long-distance, transoceanic contact common on HF because the ionosphere
cannot reflect those signals. VHF/UHF DXers look for contacts using different
methods of propagation.
VHF/UHF bands have unfairly gotten a reputation as being limited to line-of-
sight contacts. This reputation is due to the limitations of previous genera-
tions of relatively-insensitive equipment and the prevalence of FM, which
takes considerably more signal strength to provide a signal quality equivalent
to SSB and Morse code transmissions. By taking advantage of well-known
modes of radio propagation, you can extend your VHF/UHF range dramati-
cally beyond the horizon.
174
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Finding and working VHF/UHF DX
As on the HF bands, the DX is found at the very lowest frequencies on the band
in the so-called weak signal segments. For example, on the 6-meters band, 50.0
to 50.3 MHz — a 300 kHz segment as large as most HF bands — is where the
Morse code and single sideband calling frequencies are located. Similar seg-
ments exist on all VHF/UHF bands through the lower microwave frequencies.
When you’re DX-ing on VHF/UHF, stay close to these calling frequencies or set
your radio to scan across the lower end of the band and leave the radio on.
Propagation between widely separated points is often short-lived. If you wait
for somebody to call you or e-mail you with news about a DX station, you’re
probably going to miss the boat. Set your squelch control (squelch mutes the
receiver unless a signal exceeds a preset level) so that the radio is just barely
quieted. If anything shows up on frequency, the radio springs to life. This way,
you (and whoever else is in earshot) do not have to listen to receiver hiss and
random noise.
For this type of DX-ing, I recommend a small beam antenna. (Beam antennas
are discussed in Chapter 12.) These antennas are easy to build, being relatively
small compared to HF antennas, and are terrific home-brewing projects. Mount
the antenna for horizontal polarization with the antenna elements parallel to
the ground. You should be able to point the antennas in any horizontal direc-
tion, because signals may appear from nearly any direction at any time.
Sporadic-E
The term sporadic-E refers to an interesting property of one of the lower
ionospheric layers — the E-layer. Somewhere around 65 to 70 miles above the
Earth, illumination of the E-layer by the sun produces small highly-ionized
regions that are highly reflective to radio waves. So reflective, in fact, that
they can reflect 6-meter, 2-meter, 1.25-meter, and (rarely) 70-cm band signals
back to Earth. These regions don’t last more than an hour or two and drift
around over the Earth’s surface. While they’re there, though, hams can use
them as big radio reflectors. Their temporary nature has led to the name
sporadic-E for the propagation paths that use them.
Sporadic-E, or Es, propagation occurs all through the year, but is most common
in the early summer months and winter months. When Es are present, signals
appear to rise out of the noise over a few seconds as the ionized patch moves
into position between stations. The path may last for seconds or for an hour,
with signals typically very strong in both directions. Working Es with only a few
watts and very simple antennas is possible. Most VHF/UHF DXers get their
start working Es openings on 6-meters, and certainly more people are actively
DX-ing in that way than in any other.
175
Chapter 11: Specialties

Aurora
Along with sporadic-E clouds, you can find another large ionized structure in
the ionosphere — the aurora! The aurora is oriented vertically, instead of hori-
zontally like sporadic-E, but still reflects signals very well. When strong aurora
is present, VHF and UHF signals are reflected over a very wide area.
One of the neatest things about auroral propagation is the ability to add its
own audible signature to the signals it reflects! If you’ve ever seen the aurora,
you understand how dynamic it is, twisting and shimmering from moment to
moment. This movement is even more pronounced to radio waves. The result
is that signals reflected by an aurora have a characteristic rasp or buzz
impressed on the Morse tone or the spoken voice. Very strong aurora can
turn Morse transmissions into bursts of white noise and render voices unin-
telligible. Like seeing the aurora, after you hear the auroral signature, you’ll
never forget it!
Tropospheric
Also known as tropo, tropospheric propagation occurs in the atmospheric
layers closest to Earth’s surface, in an area known as the troposphere. Any kind
of large-scale abrupt change in the troposphere, such as temperature inver-
sions or weather fronts, can act as a conduit for VHF, UHF, and even microwave
signals over long distances. If your region has regular cold or warm fronts, you
can take advantage of them to reflect or convey your signals.
Tropospheric propagation supports surprisingly regular communications on
2- and 1.25-meters and between stations in California and stations on the
slopes of Hawaiian volcanoes. A stable temperature inversion layer forms
over the eastern Pacific most afternoons, so a properly located station on the
slope of a volcano at the right altitude can launch signals along the inversion.
As the inversion breaks up near land, the signals disperse and are received
by the mainland amateurs. When conditions are right, the mainlanders can
then send signals back along the same path, more than 2,500 miles!
Meteor scatter
The most fleeting reflectors of all result from the tens of thousands of mete-
ors that enter the Earth’s atmosphere each day. Traveling at thousands of
miles per hour, the friction as the meteors burn up ionizes the gas molecules
for several seconds. These ionized molecules also reflect radio signals, so
two lucky stations with the meteor trail between them can communicate for a
few seconds. The ionized trails reflect radio waves for shorter and shorter
durations as frequency increases. This makes the lowest frequency VHF
band, 6-meters (50 MHz), the “easiest” band for beginners to make contacts
using meteor scatter.
176
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Stations that attempt to make contact in this way are called ping jockeys,
because the radio waves bouncing of the trail have a characteristic ping
sound. As you may imagine, ping jockeys go into high gear around the times
of meteor showers, large and small. Because of meteor scatter, hams can
enjoy meteor showers even during daylight hours!
In order to make contact during these few seconds, hams communicate very
quickly. Voice operators make very short transmissions of their call signs and
locations. Morse code operators send short bursts of high-speed code. Taking
advantage of the capabilities of a computer and sound card, an ultra high-
speed Morse code program, HSMS (for High-Speed Meteor Scatter), automates
some of the more difficult aspects of this interesting mode.
For more information on meteor scatter, you can find several useful links, as
well as a bulletin board for meteor scatter propagation, at dxworld.com/
hsms.html.
Mountaintopping
What happens when all of the popular DX-ing methods fail to provide you
with an over-the-horizon path? Well, then, move your horizon! Because
VHF/UHF radios are light and antennas small, you can drive, pack, or carry
your gear to the tops of buildings, hills, ridges, fire lookouts, and yes, even
mountaintops.
The higher the elevation of your station, the farther your signal travels with-
out any assistance from the ionosphere, weather, or interplanetary travelers.
Camping, hiking, and driving expeditions can take on a ham radio aspect,
even if you’re just taking a hand-held radio. From the tops of many hills, you
can see for many tens of miles and a radio can see even better than you!
These expeditions are particularly popular in VHF contests, discussed in the
section “Taking Part in Radio Contests,” later in this chapter. All you have to
do is pick up a book of topographic maps of your state, load up the car with
your radio gear, and head out!
VHF propagation resources
To use the types of propagation modes I describe in this chapter effectively,
you can benefit greatly from the experiences of others. Many clubs specialize
in VHF and UHF operation and can be of great assistance to you. Use the
resources I discuss in Chapter 3 to find these clubs.
When the bands open up or an unusual propagation event occurs, getting the
word out as widely and as quickly as possible is to everyone’s benefit. Sounds
like a job for the Internet, doesn’t it? A strong community of VHF/UHF DXers is
in nearly constant communication worldwide, thanks to the Internet. My per-
sonal favorite is the set of propagation bulletin boards at dxworld.com. You
177
Chapter 11: Specialties

can find message posting pages for all of the VHF and UHF bands, specialty
pages for meteor scatter and other activities, plus links on each page to useful
resources for that topic.
VHF DX awards
Because VHF DX contacts are generally not as distant or worldwide as their
shortwave cousins, the VHF DX awards deal with geographic divisions on a
smaller scale — grid squares. Grid squares are the basis for the Maidenhead
Locator System, in which one grid square measures 1° latitude by 2° longi-
tude. Each grid square is labeled by two letters (called the field) and two
numbers (called the square). For example, my location near Seattle is in the
CN87 grid square. Grid squares are divided even further into subsquares,
which are denoted by two additional letters. My six-character grid square is
CN87sk. (The subsquare is generally noted with lowercase letters.)
In North America, where the countries tend to be very large (except in the
Caribbean), the primary VHF/UHF award program is the ARRL’s VHF/UHF
Century Club (VUCC). (Check the program out at www.arrl.org/awards/
vucc.) The number of grid squares you need to contact to qualify for VUCC
varies with the band, due to the degree of difficulty. As an example, on the
lowest two bands (6-meters and 2-meters) and for contacts made using satel-
lites, contacts on 100-grid squares are required. Along with VUCC, the ARRL’s
Worked All States (WAS) program has a vigorous VHF/UHF audience, as well.
(For more on WAS, see the section “Getting awards,” earlier in this chapter.)
In Europe, where more countries are within range of conventional VHF/UHF
propagation, many of the shortwave DX awards have a VHF/UHF counterpart.
Many VHF/UHF awards are based on contacting different countries, too.
What would DX-ing be without a distance record, too? On shortwave bands,
with signals bouncing all the way around the world, the maximum terrestrial
distance records were met long ago. In VHF/UHF, though, a lot of frontiers are
still left. Al Ward, W5LUA, has put together a complete VHF/UHF/Microwave
record list, which is posted at www.arrl.org/qst/worldabove/dxrecords.
html. Check out the amazing list of propagation modes and distances. New
records are added all the time. Maybe your call sign will be there one day. (For
more on awards, see the section “Chasing Awards,” later in this chapter.)
Taking Part in Radio Contests
How can you have a contest on the radio? What kind of rules are there? Are
there referees? Awards? If you’ve never encountered a radio contest before,
the concept can seem pretty puzzling.
178
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Radio contests, or radiosport, are competitions between stations to make as
many contacts as possible with as many different stations as possible within
the time period of the contest. Time periods range from a couple of hours to
a weekend. Restrictions say who can contact who and on what bands. With
each contact, you must exchange specific information. Often, themes dictate
which stations you are to contact, such as stations in different countries,
grids, or states.
After the contest is over, participants send their logs to the contest sponsor by
mail or, more commonly, by e-mail. The sponsor then performs the necessary
amount of cross-checking between logs to confirm that the claimed contacts
actually took place. The final score is computed and the results published in a
magazine or Web page with the winners receiving certificates, plaques, or
other non-monetary prizes.
What’s the point of such contests? Well, for one thing, they can be a lot of fun
as many stations are all on the air at once, trying for rapid-fire short contacts.
In the big international contests, such as CQ World-Wide, literally thousands of
stations are on the air at once on the bands from 160 through 10 meters from
locations spread out all over the world! In a few hours, you can find yourself
logging a WAC (Worked All Continents) and being well on your way to some of
the DX awards I cover in the previous sections. Contests are a great way to
make contacts for awards programs.
Contests are also a great way to exercise your station and operating ability to
the limits. Are you able to crack the contest pileups? Can you copy that weak
signal through the noise? Is your receiver up to the task of handling those
strong signals? If you want to increase your Morse code speed, spend some
time in a contest on the CW sub-bands. Just as with physical fitness, competi-
tive activities are fun and make staying in shape a lot more fun than solitary
calisthenics!
Types of contests
Contest styles run the gamut. Some contests are low-key, take-your-time
events taking place on a few frequencies here and there. Other contests fill a
band with hectic activity from all directions. I list some popular contests in
Table 11-2. Don’t worry if you don’t see a contest for your favorite band,
mode, or specialty — a contest exists for every taste. Use the contest calen-
dars to find your favorites. (For more on contest calendars, see the upcoming
section, “The beginning contester.”)
179
Chapter 11: Specialties

Most contests run annually and occur on the same weekend every year. The
full-weekend contests generally start at 0000Z (Friday night in the United
States) and end 48 hours later on Sunday at 2359Z. You don’t have to stay up
for two days, but some amazing operators do! Most contests have a time limit
or much shorter hours.

Operating in contests
Don’t be intimidated by the rapid-fire action that occurs during contests.
Contesting is nearly unique as a sport in that the participants score by coop-
erating with each other. Even arch-rivals need to put each other in the log for
points. The Big Guns need and want your contact. All of the participants want
to talk to you.
180
Part III: Hamming It Up 

You needn’t have a huge and powerful station to enjoy contesting — most
contesters have a simple setup. Besides, the most important part is the oper-
ator. By listening, knowing the rules, and having your station ready to go,
you’re all set.
Here’s an example of a typical contest contact — in this case my own state’s
contest, the Washington State Salmon Run. (State contests are often referred to
as QSO Parties to emphasize their easy-going style.) In this scenario, I’m NØAX
in King County, calling CQ to solicit contacts, and you’re W1AW in Connecticut,
tuning around the band to find Washington stations. The information we
exchange is a signal report (see Chapter 8) and my county and your state,
because you’re not in Washington.
NØAX: “CQ Salmon Run CQ Salmon Run from Norway Zero Alpha X-ray”
You: “Whiskey One Alpha Whiskey” (Note that you just send or say your
call sign once, using standard phonetics on voice transmissions.)
NØAX: “W1AW you’re five-nine in King County”
You: “QSL, NØAX you’re five-nine in Connecticut”
NØAX: “Thanks, QRZed Salmon Run Norway Zero Alpha X-ray”
The whole thing takes about ten seconds. Each station identifies and
exchanges the required information. The “five-nine” is the required signal
report signifying “loud and clear.” That’s an efficient contest contact and
most are not much different from that. After the contact is completed, keep
tuning for another station calling, “CQ Contest.” This method of finding sta-
tions to call is known as Search-and-Pounce operation, or S&P.
What if you miss something? Maybe you just tuned in the station and the band
is noisy or the signal is weak. My response to your call sounds like this:
NØAX: “W1AW you’re five-nine in “
You: “Sorry, please repeat your county”
NØAX: “Kilo India Norway Golf, King County”
You: “QSL, NØAX you’re five-nine in Connecticut” and so forth
You’re probably thinking, “But I missed the county, how can the signal report
be five-nine?” By convention, most contesters just use “five-nine” (or send 5NN
on Morse code — the “N” represents an abbreviated “9” — a very common
substitution for all contacts) because the type of report doesn’t affect the
score unless it’s miscopied.
Contesting is no more complicated than getting your sandwich order taken at
a busy deli counter during lunch hour. Contesting has a million variations,
but you’ll quickly recognize the basic format.

Chapter 11: Specialties

Your score consists of QSO points and multipliers. Each contact counts for one
or more QSO points, sometimes depending on the mode, band, or other spe-
cial consideration. Multipliers — so named because they multiply QSO points
for the final score — are what make each contest an exciting treasure hunt.
Depending on the theme, you may be hunting for states, grids, counties, light-
houses, islands, who knows? Read the rules carefully for how the multipliers
are counted: only once, once per band, once per mode, and so on. Special
bonus points may be awarded for working certain stations or multipliers.
The beginning contester
Start by finding out what contests are running. Many places list when contests
are held or identify a contest you find on the air. Table 11-3 shows several
sources, or you can enter contest calendar into a Web search engine. Most
Web sites include the contest rules or a link to the contest sponsor’s Web site.

After you know the rules, listen to a participating station. The most impor-
tant part of each contact is the information passed between stations, known
as the exchange. For most contests, the exchange is short — a signal report
and some identification such as a serial number (the count of contacts you
made), name, location, or club membership number. By reading the rules or
simply listening, you know what is required and in what order to send the
information.
Logging contacts on a computer (using a special program just for contests)
makes contesting easier. However, don’t worry about computer logging right
away. Pencil and paper is much easier to deal with as a beginner. Often, the
contest sponsors have a log sheet that you can print out from a Web site con-
taining all the required information.
182
Part III: Hamming It Up 

If you’re unsure of yourself, try “singing along” without actually transmitting.
Make a “cue card” that has all of the information you need to say or send. If
you think you may get flustered when the other station answers your call,
listen to a few contacts and copy the information ahead of time. Serial num-
bers advance one at a time, so you can have all of the information before
your contact.
When you’re ready, give it a try. Remember: You don’t have to be a speed
demon; just be steady. Good contest operators are smooth and efficient, so
just send your full call sign once. If the station answers with your call sign,
log the exchange and send your information only once, even if you are using
a small station. The other operator asks you to repeat yourself if some of the
information is missed.
The regular contester
So, you’ve gotten into a few contests, but when you browse through the scores,
the top scores are just out of sight! How do these guys do it? They will tell you,
“There’s no magic!” Winning contests just comes down to perseverance and
patient practice. The tricks of the trade come with time.
Computer logging makes contesting a lot easier if you are even a modest
typist. The software keeps score, maintains a dupe sheet (a page listing sta-
tions you already worked), shows needed multipliers, connects to DX spotting
networks, and creates properly formatted logs to submit to the sponsors.
I list some of the most popular software programs in Table 11-4, but just
entering contest logger into a Web search engine turns up many different
and useful programs.

Chapter 11: Specialties

If you’re search-and-pouncing, use your radio’s memories or alternate between
the main tuning frequencies. By saving the frequencies of two or three CQ-ing
stations, you can bounce back and forth between several pileups and dramati-
cally improve your rate. Keep a list of stations by frequency (called a band
map) to save time finding them and avoid working them a second time.
Many stations use DX spotting systems to find rare or needed stations in a
contest. You can, too, but be aware that the use of any such assistance you
receive usually puts you in a “multiple-operator” category. Know the rules of
the contest regarding spotting assistance and be sure to submit your score
and log in the proper category.
Calling CQ
To make a lot of contacts, you have to call CQ. In any contest, more stations are
tuning than calling. You can turn those numbers to your advantage. Find a clear
frequency (see the section “Being polite,” later in this chapter) and when
you’re sure it’s not in use, fire away. The following list offers a few examples of
the appropriate transmission when calling CQ in a contest. (In this example,
again assume your call sign is W1AW, and the contest is the Washington State
Salmon Run. Replace these terms with those appropriate to your situation.)
 Voice transmissions: “CQ Salmon Run CQ Salmon Run from Whiskey One
Alpha Whiskey, Whiskey One Alpha Whiskey, Salmon Run”
 Morse code or digital transmissions: “CQ CQ TEST DE W1AW W1AW
TEST”
 VHF/UHF transmissions: “CQ Salmon Run from W1AW grid FN31”
Keep transmissions short and call at a speed at which you feel comfortable
receiving a reply. Pause for two or three seconds between CQs before calling
again. Other stations are tuning the band and can miss your call if you leave
too much time between CQs.
When you get a stream of callers going, keep things moving steadily. Try to
send the exchange the same way every time. Eliminate saying “uh” and “um.”
Take a breath before the exchange and say it all in one smooth sentence. As
you make more contacts, your confidence steadily builds. That efficient
rhythm increases your rate — the number of contacts per minute.
Contesting being what it is, you’ll eventually encounter interference or a sta-
tion that begins calling CQ on your frequency. You have two options — stick it
out or move. Sometimes a simple, “The frequency is in use, CQ contest . . .” or
184
Part III: Hamming It Up 

“PSE QSY”(which means “please change your frequency” in Morse code-ese)
on CW does the trick. Otherwise, unless you’re confident that you have a
strong signal and good technique, just finding a new frequency may be more
effective for you. The higher end of the bands is often less crowded and you
may be able to hold a frequency longer.
Submitting a log
When you finish operating, if you want to see your score in the results, follow
the instructions in the rules to submit your log. Most sponsors now accept
logs via e-mail — usually as a text file. Many of the larger contests require or
encourage the use of the Cabrillo format for logs, which is just a type of form
letter that your logging software can generate. Check with the software author
or contest sponsors if you’re unsure. Even if you’re not interested in having
your score in the results, submitting your log just for the sponsor to use for
checking other logs (called submitting a check log) is appreciated by the
sponsors to improve the quality of the final scoring.
If you decide to mail in a paper log or disk, be sure all of the required infor-
mation is included. Use a disk or CD mailer for protection. Many sponsors
post a Logs Received Web page so that you can be sure yours was received.
Don’t miss the deadline for submitting logs!
Being polite
Large contests can fill up most or all of a shortwave band, particularly during
voice-transmission contests, and often causes friction with non-contest oper-
ators. As in most conflicts, each side needs to engage in some give-and-take
to keep the peace. If you’re participating in a contest, be courteous and make
reasonable accommodations for non-contesters. If you’re not contesting, rec-
ognize that large competitive events are a legitimate activity and you need to
be flexible in your operating expectations.
That said, how can you get along with everyone? First, be sure your signal is
clean, not distorted or generating key clicks. (You might hear about such
problems from stations operating near you.) A distorted signal’s intelligibility
is greatly reduced. A clean signal gets more callers every time and occupies
less bandwidth. Keep your noise blanker and preamp off (read about these
devices in the technical supplement on the Ham Radio For Dummies Web site
or in your radio’s operating manual) and use every receiver adjustment on
the front panel, including the front-end attenuator.
185
Chapter 11: Specialties

Second, listen before you leap. Non-contest contacts are more relaxed with
longer pauses, so a couple of seconds of dead air doesn’t mean the frequency
is clear. Asking “Is the frequency in use?” (or “QRL?” in Morse code) before call-
ing CQ is the right thing to do whether you’re in a contest or not. If a Morse
code contact is ongoing, the response to your query may be just a “dit” (mean-
ing “Yes, it’s busy”) if the other operator is in the middle of trying to copy an
exchange from a different station. When in a contest, keep a minimum of 1.5
kHz between you and adjacent contest contacts on phone and 400 Hz on CW.
Don’t expect a perfectly clear channel. Contesters should tune higher in the
band to find less-congested frequencies and give non-contest QSOs a little-
wider margin.
Avoid major net frequencies, such as the Maritime Service Net on 14.300
MHz. Be aware of any emergency communications declarations or where
regional emergency nets may meet and give those frequencies a wide berth.
Calling frequencies are often busy with non-contest activity.
Learning about contesting
I’ve only been able to touch lightly on many important topics. After you start,
many resources are available to the novice and master contester alike that
can help them learn and improve. Many cost little or nothing — only the time
to find and read about them.
QST and CQ magazines both feature contest results and articles on technique.
The ARRL also publishes the National Contest Journal (www.ncjweb.com),
which sponsors several HF contests every year and features interviews with
contesters, plus articles and columns on contesting. ARRL members can
receive the biweekly e-mail newsletter The Contester’s Rate Sheet (www.arrl.
org/contests/rate-sheet) without charge. The CQ-Contest e-mail mailing
list is a source of many good ideas. Subscribe to it at www.contesting.com.
The best way to learn is to work with an experienced contester. Probably one
or two multiple-operator stations in your region are active in the big contests.
Look through the results of previous contests for their call signs. Contact the
station owner and volunteer to help out — most are eager to have you on
board or can help you find another team. As a rookie, expect to listen, log, or
spot new multipliers — all valuable learning opportunities. When you know the
ropes, you can fill in on the air more and more.
Along with the multi-operator stations, many contest clubs are around the
country. Look at the club scores in the writeups and contact them. All con-
testers started just like you.

Chasing Awards
If the awards I mention in the section on DX-ing piqued your interest, the fol-
lowing sections discuss awards in greater detail. Seeking awards is one of the
most fulfilling activities in the hobby of ham radio. Certificates are the usual
reward and are often referred to as wallpaper. Indeed, some radio shacks that
I’ve visited are often literally papered (ceilings, too) with certificates and
awards. They come in all shapes, sizes, and colors. Some wallpapers are plain
and other wallpapers are as colorful and as detailed as paintings or photo-
graphs. If awards sound interesting, you may be a member of the species of
ham known as the paper chaser or wallpaper hanger! Believe me, a lot of them
are out there!
Finding awards and special events
CQ magazine runs a column featuring novel awards every month. The K1BV
Awards Directory lists more than 3,000 DX awards from nearly every country!
Want to try for the “Tasmanian Devil” award? Contact VK7 (Tasmania’s prefix)
amateurs. How about the South African Relay League’s “All Africa” award for
contacting the six South African call areas and 25 other African countries?
Most awards have no time limit, but some span a given period, often a year.
For example, the ARRL’s Millenium DXCC Award was for contacts during the
year 2000. Whatever your tastes and capabilities, you can find awards that
suit you. You can find the awards directory and an extensive list of Web links,
along with the K1BV directory at www.dxawards.com/book.html.
Along with ongoing awards programs, you can find many special event sta-
tions and operations. These often feature special call signs with unusual pre-
fixes, of great interest to hams chasing the WPX award, and colorful, unusual
QSL cards. Ham stations are often part of large sporting events or public fes-
tivals, such as international expositions and the Olympics. Some events are
as small as a county fair, such as the Calaveras County Frog Jumping Jubilee
whose station generated the novel certificate shown in Figure 11-3. The larger
special event stations are well publicized and are listed on Web pages such as
www.arrl.org/contests/spev.html or on the ham Internet portals I dis-
cuss in Chapter 3. Other special event stations just show up unannounced on
the air, which makes finding them exciting.
187
Chapter 11: Specialties

Getting the contacts
Before embarking on a big adventure to achieve an obscure award, find out if
it is still active by checking with the sponsors. Beware of outdated Web sites,
too. Before proceeding, get a positive “go ahead” if you have the slightest
question if an award program is active.
Determine whether the award requires you to submit QSL cards. Overseas
sponsors may allow you to submit a simple list of contacts complying with
their General Certification Rules (GCR) in place of having to submit actual
cards.
When you make an eligible contact, be sure to log any information that the
award may require. For example, if you’re working Japanese cities, some
awards may require that you get a city number or other ID. This information
may or may not be printed on the other station’s QSL card you receive for the
contact, so you need to ask for the information during the contact itself. Grid
square information is not always on QSLs, either. Be sure to ask during the
contact or with a written note on the QSL you send!

188
Part III: Hamming It Up 

If you make a contact for an award favoring a certain geographic area, ask the
station if he or she would let others know you’re chasing the award. That may
even generate a couple more contacts right on the spot! Certainly, the request
lets his or her associates know to listen for you on the band or perhaps arrange
a schedule. This technique helps a lot with difficult awards or remote areas.
Applying for awards
When applying for an award, be sure to use the proper forms, addresses, and
forms of payments. Make sure you follow the instructions to the letter for sub-
mitting your application. If you aren’t certain, ask the sponsor. Don’t send your
hard-earned QSLs or money before you’re convinced you know what to do.
You often see IRCs accepted in place of cash. An IRC is a postal system Inter-
national Reply Coupon. These are sold by post offices around the world and
are good for one unit of surface postage in the receiving country. Because
foreign currency may not be accepted (or even legal!) in some countries, the
IRC is a form of “ham dollars” that you can exchange for postage or awards.
You can read all about IRCs at www.upu.int/irc/en/index.html#zone_
reserve.
When you do apply for the awards, you may want to send the application by
registered or certified mail, particularly if precious QSLs, cash, or IRCs are
inside. Outside the developed countries, postal workers are notorious for
opening any mail that may contain valuables. Make your mail look as boring
and ordinary as possible. Keep envelopes thin, flat, and opaque.
QRP: Low-Power Operating
Whole books have been written about using QRP, or low-power operating
(sometimes called flea power), and many low-power devotees are on the air.
Why would you want to use low power and a weak signal instead of high
power and a strong signal? For the same reason there are fly fishermen and
free-climbers: skill. Putting as little as possible between yourself and the sta-
tion at the other end and still making the contact takes skill. Build up a little
experience and then give QRP a try.
QRP is up to 5 watts of transmitter output power on Morse code transmis-
sions and 10 watts of peak power on voice, usually SSB. The quality of your
antenna or location is not considered; just transmitter power. If you choose
to turn the power down below a watt, that’s called milliwatting.
189
Chapter 11: Specialties

QRP is primarily an HF activity and the majority of QRP contacts are in Morse
code due to its efficiency. QRPers often hang out around their calling frequen-
cies, shown in Table 11-5. To start QRP-ing, just tune to a clear frequency
nearby and call CQ — no need to call CQ QRP unless you specifically want to
contact other QRPers. Here’s how it works.

If you’re just getting started, tune in a strong signal and give them a call with
your transmitter output power turned down to QRP levels (check the radio
operating manual for instructions). Make sure your transmissions are clear,
which allows the other station to copy your call sign easily. Some low-power
stations send their call with “/QRP” tacked on to the end to indicate they’re
190
Part III: Hamming It Up 

running low power. This procedure isn’t really necessary during the initial
call and can be confusing if your signal is weak. After all, that’s four more
characters for the other station to copy, isn’t it?
QRPers delight in building their own equipment, and the smaller and lighter
the better. You can find a lot of kits, such as the popular (and tiny) RockMite
transceiver shown in Figure 11-4, and home-brew designs for the ham with
good construction skills. QRPers probably build more equipment than those
in any other segment of the hobby, so if you want to learn about radio elec-
tronics, you may consider joining a QRP club and one of the QRP e-mail mail-
ing lists.
QRP-only contests and QRP categories are in nearly all of the major contests.
Many awards have a special endorsement for one-way and two-way QRP. The
QRP clubs themselves have a whole set of awards, of which my all-time favorite
is the 1,000 Miles Per Watt award (www.qrparci.org/arciawds.html). Some
stations make contact with so little power that their figures are in the millions
of miles per watt!

The major QRP gatherings that occur every year are:
 Dayton Hamvention: This gathering is called “Four Days in May.”
QRPers come from all around the world to attend and enough of them fill
a hotel and have their own mini-convention.
 Pacificon: West Coast QRP enthusiasts put on this convention in
October in the San Francisco area.
 Frederichshafen: European QRPers get together at this giant hamfest.
Look for smaller QRP forums or mini-conventions held as part of regional ham
conventions or hamfests.
Getting Digital
Operating on the digital modes (transmitting signals encoded as a stream of
data, instead of speech or Morse code) is the fastest growing segment of ama-
teur radio today. Hams are using fast computers to create some novel means of
communications. Not only are hams adapting commercial technologies such as
the Internet standard TCP/IP protocols, but also creating entirely new ones,
such as PSK and Throb.
On HF bands, digital data transmission protocols must overcome the hostile treat-
ment given to delicate bits and bytes by the ionosphere and atmospheric noise.
The protocols (such as PSK31, PACTOR, Throb, and so on) tend to use short
transmissions, with robust error detection and correction mechanisms. Limits on
transmission bandwidth also contribute to low data transmission rates, but these
restrictions have also stimulated hams into the creation of interesting protocols.
On VHF bands, digital data modes have fewer restrictions on bandwidth. For
example, on 440 MHz and up, you can use 56k baud technology. The bands
are quieter, with less fading and interference, so data speeds begin to approx-
imate those of dial-up landline services.
Radioteletype (RTTY)
CW, or Morse code, is really the first digital mode, but the first fully automated
data transmission protocol was radioteletype. Commercialized in the 1930s,
RTTY, or ritty to hams, uses a 5-bit code known as Baudot — the origin of the
word “baud” used in digital transmission today. The Baudot code sends plain
text characters as 5-bit codes that use alternating patterns of two different
audio frequencies known as mark and space, creating a type of modulation
called Frequency Shift Keying or FSK.
193
Chapter 11: Specialties

The tones, 2125 Hz (mark) and 2295 Hz (space), fit within a normal voice’s
bandwidth and thus the RTTY signal can be transmitted with a regular SSB
transceiver in place of a voice signal. The rate at which characters can be
sent is from 60 to 100 wpm. On the receiving end, an SSB transceiver receives
the transmission as an audio signal.
The text characters are turned into and recovered from the pair of mark and
space tones by either a computer/sound card combination or by a standalone
modulator/demodulator. Fans of the antique teleprinters that used rotating
mechanical contacts and briefcase-sized tone encoding equipment keep them
running and use them on the bands even today. If you get a chance to watch
one at work, you’ll be amazed at their mechanical complexity!
If you are using a computer to convert the RTTY signal to readable text, the
decoding software will present a visual display that allows you to adjust your
receiver so that the audio tones are received as the proper frequencies (2125
and 2295 Hz) for the software to decode into characters. RTTY operators some-
times send “RYRYRYRYRY . . .” which results in a repeating tone sequence of
mark followed by space that allows a listening operator to tune in their signal.
Although RTTY is being supplanted by the more modern modes developed in
the past decade, it is still a strong presence on the bands. Tune through the
digital signals above the CW stations and you hear lots of two-tone signals
“diddling” to each other. A sizeable community of RTTY DXers and several
major award programs have RTTY endorsements. DX-peditions often include
RTTY in their operating plan, as well. Table 11-7 lists several online resources
for beginning RTTY operators.

TOR modes — AMTOR, PACTOR
TOR is an acronym for Teleprinting Over Radio, which means that TOR sys-
tems send text characters. A user of RTTY quickly discovers that the fading
and distortion common on HF can do serious damage to characters sent
using the Baudot code. The TOR systems include data organization and error-
correction mechanisms to overcome these limitations.
AMTOR was the first TOR system for amateurs, adapted from a commercial
technology called SITOR in the early 1980s. Like RTTY, AMTOR uses frequency-
shift keying to generate the on-the-air audio. Characters are 7 bits long
(Baudot uses 5) and sent in short blocks with pauses between them to allow
other stations to respond. This system makes AMTOR transmissions sound
like regularly-spaced chirps on the air. Two stations in contact using AMTOR
chirp alternately at each other as they exchange the blocks of characters.
AMTOR has two modes, depending on whether a station is calling CQ or in
contact with another station. When calling, because no receiver reports
errors, blocks of five characters are sent twice. After two stations establish
contact, the transmitting station transmits groups of three characters, paus-
ing for a “received OK” chirp from the receiving station. AMTOR has proven
to be reliable, but is fairly slow and cannot send regular data.
PACTOR addresses some of AMTOR’s flaws with an improved data structure
and better error management mechanics. Less overhead is associated with
transmissions using PACTOR and the protocol adjusts its speed based on
conditions. PACTOR II is an improved version that is backwards-compatible
with PACTOR, but has the ability to use a more advanced modulation tech-
nique called Phase Shift Keying (PSK) to increase the data rate. The manage-
ment of the transmission and reception process is also much improved over
PACTOR. PACTOR III is the most recent release of this technology. All ver-
sions of PACTOR are proprietary designs and only available in equipment
available from the manufacturer, Special Communications Systems.
Other similar data modes include the proprietary CLOVER, CLOVER II, and
CLOVER 2000 protocols developed by HAL Communications. These modes
use increasingly intelligent management of the way the data transmission and
reception protocols react to band conditions. The transmitted waveform
shapes and frequencies are carefully managed to keep the signal within a 500
Hz bandwidth and decrease errors caused by HF propagation.
You can find a discussion of the TOR modes mixed in with a discussion of all
of the other digital modes, so the best resources for AMTOR and PACTOR are
on Web pages that cover many different modes. The ARRL digital data Web
page at www.arrl.org/tis/info/digital.html has links to numerous
useful sites.

Packet
Packet is short for packet radio, a radio-based networking system based on
the commercial X.25 data transfer protocol. Developed by the Tucson Amateur
Packet Radio group, or TAPR, packet’s ability to send error-corrected data
over VHF links enabled a number of novel new data systems to be created for
hams. Table 11-8 lists three excellent online resources for packet radio users.

With packet, ordinary VHF/UHF FM transceivers transfer the data as audio
tones. An external modem, called a Terminal Node Controller (TNC),
Multimode Communications Processor (MCP), or sometimes a Multiple
Protocol Converter (MPC), provides the interface between the radio and a
computer or terminal. Data is sent at either 1200 or 9600 baud as packets of
variable length, up to about 1,000 bytes. The protocol that controls packet
construction, transmission control, and error correction is called AX.25, for
Amateur X.25. Packet systems can also use the TCP/IP protocol and a number
of packet systems use it.
Like wired networks, packet systems are connected together in many different
ways. Packet networks extend across most of the United States and Europe,
with gateways to the Internet in several places. A packet controller is called a
node. The connection between nodes is a link. Connecting to a remote node
by using an intermediate node to relay packets is called digipeating. A node
that does nothing but relay packets is a digipeater. A node that makes a con-
nection between two different packet networks or between a packet network
and the Internet is called a gateway.
Packet radio, using its 1200- or 9600-baud protocol, does not attempt to com-
pete with the higher speeds of WLAN technology. A number of groups are
now beginning to use WLAN hardware on the amateur bands (see the section,
196
Part III: Hamming It Up 

“Amateur WLAN and high-speed data”). Packet remains in use around the
United States for now — particularly as an effective mode of emergency
communications — but look for it to gradually be replaced by more modern
technology.
Bulletin boards
The most common use of packet is to support a packet bulletin board system
(PBBS). A PBBS typically has users from a local area that can contact the
PBBS via a VHF band either directly or by digipeating. The PBBS is operated
just the same as a regular telephone dial-up BBS. In fact, some BBSs support
both types of access.
The PBBS offers file transfer and storage, bulletins, network relay, mailboxes,
and other useful functions. Although the Internet has reduced the impor-
tance of the PBBS in favor of the Web, packet systems are still quite common
and are frequently deployed to support emergency communications.
Packet Cluster
The DX spotting networks now so prevalent on the Internet started as local
groups of DXers using packet radio to relay information about DX stations.
Packet Cluster is a special form of bulletin board software designed by Dick
Newell AK1A to act as an information service for DXers to distribute spots of
DX stations. These bulletin boards are referred to as clusters because the
group was configured as one central information server station surrounded
by client stations that connected to the server by a VHF radio link using the
packet radio AX.25 protocol. Along with DX spots, clusters now handle text
messages, data files, weather, and solar activity data. Packet Cluster has been
adapted for commercial and public safety use worldwide.
The clusters were originally limited to local groups, but quickly grew to
regional networks that now may have hundreds of users connected at any
given time. The radio cluster networks are also connected to the Internet
spotting networks through gateways, so information is collected locally on
VHF, passed through the packet network, exchanged with a network on a dif-
ferent continent via the Internet, and then re-sent via VHF.
HF packet
Although it is poorly suited for the conditions encountered on HF, you can
make packet work below 30 MHz. The main difficulty is that AX.25 packets
are too long for the rapidly changing and noisy HF channels and so an exces-
sive number of packets are rejected due to errors. Retransmission is very
inefficient and so HF packet’s throughput is not very high, leading to it being
rarely used on the HF bands.

Chapter 11: Specialties

PSK modes
The most exciting new digital mode for use in the HF spectrum is PSK31.
Peter Martinex G3PLX invented the new mode and developed a complete
package of Windows-based software to support it. He generously placed his
creation in the ham radio public domain and hams are adopting it like wild-
fire. If you want to find out more about using PSK31, Table 11-9 contains sev-
eral good reference Web links.
PSK stands for Phase Shift Keying and the 31 represents the miniscule 31.25 Hz
occupied by a PSK31 signal. It also uses a new coding system for characters,
called Varicode, that has a different number of bits for different characters —
not unlike Morse code. Instead of turning a carrier on and off to transmit the
code, a continuous tone is transmitted that signifies the bits of the code by
shifting its timing relationship (known as phase) with a reference signal. A
receiver syncs up with the transmitter and decodes even very noisy signals,
because the receiver knows when to look for the phase changes.
When you tune across a PSK31 signal, the signal doesn’t chirp, but rather
warbles in a very characteristic way. Because the human ear has difficulty
distinguishing between pitches so close together, tuning by ear alone is diffi-
cult. This difficulty brought about a new visual tuning technique, not too dif-
ferent than that used for RTTY.
PSK31 is very tolerant of the noise and other disturbances on HF bands. In fact,
you can obtain nearly solid copy with signals barely stronger than the noise
itself. Figure 11-5 shows the DigiPan software display of several signals, some
quite weak. The lighter streaks represent signals and each horizontal line rep-
resents a new sampling of the receiver’s output. New signals appear at the
top and slowly drift downwards, thus earning the display the “waterfall” name.

Part III: Hamming It Up 

Because the bandwidth of PSK31 is so narrow, finding other PSK31 stations
on the air requires a pretty good idea of where they are. The most common
frequencies are 3580.150, 7080.15, 10142.150, 14070.150, 18100.150, and
21080.150 MHz.
Since PSK31’s introduction, a number of enhancements have been made to
the original protocol, including a variant called PSK63 that adds some fea-
tures and quality improvements at the expense of wider bandwidth. PSK31
contests are held everywhere, and a growing community of PSK31/63 users
can be found around the world.
Amateur WLAN and high-speed data
The widespread adoption of wireless LAN technology (WiFi, 802.11b, and
802.11g) by computer users has brought the same technology within reach of
amateurs, as well. Hams share the 2.4 GHz band with unlicensed LAN devices,
but without the power restrictions of consumer equipment.
Ham experimenters are in the process of adapting commercial WLAN proto-
cols to Amateur Radio, with higher transmitter power and larger antennas
than commercial technology to support a set of developmental protocols

known as High Speed Multimedia Radio (HSMM). The network they envision
is called the Hinternet (for Ham Internet). With the higher power levels per-
mitted for amateurs, their intent is to create long-distance data links that run
at equivalent data rates to the short-range commercial technology available
today. This technology will eventually replace the much slower packet radio
networks in place today.
Some experimental work is being done using spread spectrum modems on
the UHF and microwave ham bands. At present, this is a relatively small com-
munity of experimenters that is attempting to extend the range of commer-
cial technology on amateur frequencies. Momentum is beginning to build for
these modes and the coming years are likely to see an upsurge in amateur
use of these technologies. An amateur satellite (dubbed PANSAT) that would
use spread spectrum modes is in the design stages. TAPR hosts the largest
community of spread spectrum enthusiasts.
If you’d like to know more about HSMM, TAPR, Hinternet, RLAN (Radio LAN),
or amateur use of spread spectrum techniques, here are links to active
groups:

 Green Bay Professional Packet Radio: www.gbppr.org
Amateur radio is also beginning to see the first digital voice links: Icom, one
of the largest radio manufacturers, has introduced its D-Star system of radios,
repeaters, and data link equipment. D-Star is an open standard and amateurs
and other groups are being encouraged to develop interfaces to this equip-
ment. The system uses a high-speed data link that can also be used to trans-
fer data. You can find out more about D-Star at www.icomamerica.com/
amateur/dstar. If history is any guide, other high-speed data technologies
will soon follow. This is an exciting time for digital innovation in ham radio.
APRS
The Automatic Position Reporting System (APRS) is an amateur invention
that marries GPS positioning and packet radio, and was developed by Bob
Bruninga WB4APR. Stations using APRS connect the location data from GPS
receivers to a 2-meter radio and transmit “I am here” data packets. The pack-
ets are either received directly by other hams or by a packet radio digipeater.
200
Part III: Hamming It Up 

If they are received by the digipeater, they may also be received by a gateway
station that relays the call sign and position information to an APRS server
accessed through the Internet.
After the information is received by a server, it’s accessed by using a Web
browser or an APRS viewing program. Figure 11-6 shows a map with the loca-
tion of WA1LOU-8. (“WA1LOU” is a call sign. The -8 is a Secondary Station ID or
SSID so that the call sign is used for several different purposes with different
SSIDs.) You can see that WA1LOU is in mid-Connecticut, 7.9 miles northeast of
Waterbury.You can also zoom in on WA1LOU’s location. If he changes his
position, this change is updated on the maps at the rate he decides to have
his APRS system broadcast the information.
If you have a GPS receiver with an NMEA 0183 data output port (NMEA is the
National Marine Electronics Association) and a 2-meter rig and packet radio
TNC (see the discussion on Packet earlier in this chapter), you’re ready to par-
ticipate! (Kenwood even makes APRS-ready 2-meter radios, the TH-D7A and
TH-D700, that are connected directly to a GPS receiver.) The most common
frequency for APRS is 144.39 MHz, although you can use 145.01 and 145.79
MHz. You can find a group of HF APRS users using LSB transmission on 10.151
MHz. (The actual tones are below the carrier frequency of 10.151 MHz and so
fall inside the 30-meter band.)
You can do a lot more with APRS than just report location. Popular mapping
software offers interfaces so that you can have street-level maps linked to
your position in real time by ham radio! Race organizers use APRS to keep
track of far-flung competitors. You can also add weather conditions to APRS
data to contribute to a real-time automated weather tracking network. To find
out more, including detailed instructions about configuring equipment, the
resources listed in Table 11-10 are good starting points.

Operating on the digital modes
You can gain access to the digital modes at very low cost by building or
buying a simple interface between an HF or VHF radio and a computer with a
sound card. This setup allows you to connect your radio and computer
together (the topic of Chapter 15). To use the proprietary PACTOR II or
CLOVER protocols, you need an external MCP (Multimode Communications
Processor) that acts as a modulator/demodulator for several different data
transmission protocols. A long list of suitable software for both sound cards
and MCPs is at home.wanadoo.nl/nl9222/digisoft.htm. To pick up digital
modes quickly, the ARRL has an excellent online course, HF Digital
Communications EC-005 (www.arrl.org/cce/courses.html#ec005).
You find digital data at the upper end of the CW (Morse code) segments of
the HF bands. The signals are mixed in with CW stations and the different
modes generally get along pretty well. RTTY calling frequencies are on sev-
eral bands: 3.590, 7.040, 14.080, 21.080, 28.080, and 50.7 MHz. You can find the
burgeoning PSK community in the vicinity of 3.580, 7.080, and 14.070 MHz.

The overall band plans at www.arrl.org/FandES/field/regulations/

Operating via Satellites
Non-hams are usually pretty surprised when you tell them about ham radio
satellites. The first amateur satellite, OSCAR-1 (which stood for Orbiting
Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio), was built by American hams and went into
orbit in 1961, just a couple of years after the Russians launched the Sputnik
satellite, igniting the space race. Today, hams have quite a number of satellites
with missions ranging from digital mailboxes to repeaters to scientific experi-
ments. The latest to go up was built by a group of Saudi Arabian students and
hams; SO-50 or Saudisat 1C. It carries several experiments and a 2-meter FM
repeater.
Satellite basics
Most amateur satellites are located in near-circular Low Earth Orbit, or LEO,
circling the earth a number of times each day. A few have non-circular
“Molniya” orbits that take them high above the earth where they are visible
for hours at a time. (Molniya is “lightning” in Russian and is the name given
to their fleet of communications satellites that travel in elliptical orbits.)
For practical and regulatory reasons, satellite transmissions are restricted to
the bands on 10-meters; on the 2-meter, 70-cm; and microwave bands at 1296
MHz and higher. The ionosphere usually does not pass signals at lower fre-
quencies and satellite antennas need to be small, requiring shorter wavelength.
The input frequencies are called the uplink and the output frequencies are
called the downlink. The numbers that describe a satellite’s orbit (and allow
software to determine where it is) are called the orbital or Keplerian elements.
These pieces of information allow you to operate using a satellite!
You find three common types of satellites.
 Transponder: These satellites listen on a range of frequencies on one
band, translate those signals to a different band, and then retransmit
them in real time.
 Repeater: These satellites act just like terrestrial repeaters, listening and
receiving on a specific pair of channels. Satellite repeaters are crossband,
meaning their input and output frequencies are on different bands.
203
Chapter 11: Specialties

 Digital: Digital satellites can act as bulletin boards (BBS) or as store-and-
forward systems. You can access both types of digital satellites using
regular packet radio protocols and equipment. The International Space
Station (ISS) and Space Shuttle (STS) both have digital BBS systems avail-
able to hams on the ground. The ISS also has an APRS digipeater onboard!
Store-and-forward satellites act as message gateways, accepting messages
and downloading them to a few control stations around the world. The
control stations also pass messages back up to the satellites that are
downloaded by ground-based users. Digital satellites are very useful to
hams at sea or in remote locations.
Accessing the satellites
The best place to go to find out which satellites are active and in what mode
is the AMSAT home page (www.amsat.org). Click the Satellite Frequencies
and Status link to get the complete set of information on what each satellite
does and its current operational status.
To access satellites, you also need a satellite tracking program. Several free
or shareware trackers are available, such as STSPLUS, which is available for a
$15 donation from www.dransom.com/stsplus.html. AMSAT also provides
several tracking and satellite operation programs. After you have the tracking
software, obtain the Keplerian elements for the satellite you’re seeking from
the AMSAT site at www.amsat.org/amsat/keps/menu.html. Enter them into
your software, and make sure that your computer’s time and date are correct.
A complete set of instructions on using the satellites is beyond the scope of
Ham Radio For Dummies, but here is a short example of how to connect to
the packet station aboard the ISS and receive a nice certificate!
You need a 2-meter FM radio with 10 to 25 watts of output. An omnidirec-
tional antenna works and a small beam is even better. You also need a packet
radio TNC, such as a Kantronics KPC-3 or the equivalent. You need a com-
puter running a terminal program, such as Hyperterm or Procomm, logging
information both to and from the TNC.
1. Configure the TNC parameters as follows:
AUTOCR

LFADD

TIME STAMP

2. Set your transceiver to receive on 145.800 MHz and transmit on
145.990 MHz.
3. Find the right time.
Use the tracking software to determine when the ISS has a long high-
angle pass near your location with an elevation of 40 degrees or more to
give you a clear path and a long view. When the time comes, start listen-
ing to the receiver audio.
4. Get the signal.
When you hear a signal, your TNC decodes the packet messages. If the
ISS is already connected to another station, you probably see Index
packets, such as
“RS0ISS-1>N0AX <<I2>>:To : N0AX”
if I (NØAX) am logged onto the ISS system.
Only one station can be logged on at a time, so you need to be sure you
aren’t hearing packets from anyone else before you begin transmitting.
If you do hear packets, watch your screen and wait for this message:
RS0ISS-1>CQ/V [12/30/02 04:20:59]: <<UI>>: - Logged off
“NOW YOU MAY BEGIN CALLING ISS, C RS0ISS”
5. Respond to the ISS.
Tell your TNC to connect to the ISS by typing C RS0ISS-1. If you are suc-
cessful, you receive a message that looks like this:
30-Jun-02 09:03:43 CONNECTED to RS0ISS-1
Logged on to RS0ISS’s Personal Message System on
board the International Space Station
If you are unsuccessful or the ISS system is busy, another pass should
occur shortly — the ISS is up there 24 hours a day. Keep trying. Sooner
or later you’ll get through!
6. Success! Begin celebrating!
After you calm down, politely log off by typing BYE or by using Command
mode of the TNC to disconnect.

before calling the ISS.
Seeing Things — Image Transmissions
So far, all of the ham transmissions I covered have either been voice, data,
or codes. Don’t hams care about pictures and graphics? They do! With the
increasing availability of excellent cameras and computer software, getting on
one of the amateur image modes, such as slow-scan or fast-scan television and
facsimile, is never easier. The next few sections discuss these image modes.
Figure 11-7 shows examples of images sent on each mode.
Figure 11-7:

206
Part III: Hamming It Up 

Slow-scan television (SSTV) 
and Facsimile (Fax)
Pioneered back in the 1960s, slow-scan has re-emerged in the last ten years as
a popular image mode. You can find slow-scan primarily on HF where SSB
voice transmission is the norm. The name comes from the fact that transmit-
ting the picture over a narrow channel made for voice transmissions takes
several seconds.
You can send slow-scan pictures using a commercial scan-converter that con-
verts the regular camera video to slow-scan formats and an HF transceiver.
SSTV enthusiasts are rapidly eliminating the standalone converters in favor
of a computer with a video camera interface and a sound card. Software is
used both to convert the camera video to data files and to encode and
decode the data files as audio that can be transmitted and received with a
voice SSB transceiver.
You can usually hear slow-scan signals in the vicinity of 14.230 and 21.340
MHz using USB transmissions. Depending on the picture format you use, the
signals make a “loopy loopy loopy” sound with the video and color informa-
tion being encoded as different audio tones. Other tones mark the edges of
the picture frame. Each “loop” is one line of picture. Data file transmissions
may sound more like multiple tones mixed together.
Facsimile-over-radio was at one time a very widely used method of obtaining
weather information from land-based and satellite stations. Transmissions of
Group I and Group II facsimile standard signals could be successfully made
via ham radio transceivers, as well. The use of standalone fax machines and
modems, never very widespread, is rapidly disappearing in favor of transmit-
ting the images as data files, just as with SSTV. Regular fax images can still be
received from orbiting weather satellites, however.
The software packages that transmit data files as SSTV images often make no
distinction between data captured from video and data received from a fax
service. You will find many good links to detailed information about slow-
scan TV and facsimile transmission at these Web addresses:

 www.arrl.org/tis/info/sstv.html
 www.arrl.org/tis/info/wefax.html
207
Chapter 11: Specialties

Fast-scan television
You can also send full-motion video, just like regular broadcasters, with fast-
scan video transmissions. Fast-scan uses the same video standards as broad-
cast and consumer video, so you don’t need to buy special conversion
equipment. This mode is usually referred to as ATV or Amateur Television. It
is most popular in metropolitan and suburban areas where transmission dis-
tances are relatively short. ATV even has its own repeaters!
ATV transmissions are restricted to the 70-cm band and higher frequencies
because of their wide bandwidth — up to 6 MHz. You won’t be able to use
your regular 70-cm transmitter to handle that bandwidth, so you must con-
struct or purchase a transmitter designed specifically for ATV. The transmit-
ters are designed to accept a regular video camera signal, so little extra
equipment, except a good antenna, is required to use ATV.
Because ATV transmissions use the same video transmission format as TV
broadcasters, regular television receivers are used as receivers, with a fre-
quency converter to transfer the ham band ATV signals to one of the higher
UHF TV channels where they are received just like any other TV signal.

Building and
Operating a
Station That
Works 

In this part . . .
T
o take part in all the ham radio fun stuff, you have
to assemble your own ham radio station. A station
can be pretty simple, but the more you know, the easier
setting yours up is. You start by figuring out what you
want to accomplish with your ham radio and what your
resources are. Then you can choose your radios, anten-
nas, and accessories. 
After you get your station together, you discover how to
operate the station and keep simple records. You develop
the savvy to get on the air with a good signal and a deft
hand at the controls. (I wish this book had been around
when I was just getting started!)

Chapter 12
Getting on the Air
In This Chapter
 Making decisions about your station
 Choosing radio equipment
 Picking an antenna
 Computers in the shack
 Buying new or used equipment
O
ne of the most common questions an Elmer (mentor) hears (aside from
“What’s the answer to number 22?”) is “What kind of radio should I
buy?” An honest Elmer always replies, “That depends!” Which antenna to buy
depends on a whole lot of things, too!
Even a casual stroll through the ads in CQ or QST turns up page after page of
colorful photos, with digits winking, lights blinking, and meter needles jump-
ing. Antennas are even more numerous, with elements sticking out every
which way, doodads dripping off of them, and all manner of claims made
about performance. Then you have to sort through nearly an infinite number
of accessories and software packages. The decision can be overwhelming!
How do you choose between them?
Setting Goals for Your Station
Don’t tell anybody, but you’re about to embark on a journey called “system
design.” You may think making decisions is impossible, but all you have to do
is a little thinking up front.
Goals and personal resources
You can find a lot of different activities in ham radio — casual, competitive,
technical, public service — which I cover in Part III. While participating in

212
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 
many of them using the same equipment is possible, before you begin acquir-
ing additional equipment is the time to consider these questions:
 What attracted you to ham radio the very first time?
 After reading about the different operating activities and modes avail-
able, can you pick two or three that really pique your interest?
 If you know and admire a ham, does he or she do something that you
want to do?
 Are you most attracted to the shortwaves or to the VHF and UHF bands?
 What sounds most intriguing — the new digital modes, chatting by
voice, or mastering Morse code?
 Will you operate from home, while mobile, or portable? (Or all three?)
 Do you intend to participate mainly for enjoyment or for a specific pur-
pose, such as emergency or travel communications?
All these considerations color your choice of equipment. Knowing your ham
radio resources is also important:
 What’s your budget for getting on the air?
 How much space do you have available for your shack?
 How much space do you have for antennas?
Now comes the fun part — shopping and choosing!
To get an idea of what products are available, the advertisements in recent
copies of QST, CQ, and WorldRadio magazines show models that are recently
introduced. If you have a license, no doubt you receive a copy of a catalog
from Ham Radio Outlet (HRO) or Amateur Electronic Supply (AES), two of the
large, nationwide equipment distributors. Perhaps MFJ Enterprises sent you
a catalog with its extensive line of accessories. If you have a local radio store,
make a visit and browse through the catalogs and product brochures. Inquire
about upcoming sales or promotions. The goal is to gather a wide variety of
information.
Operating from home
A home station is a semi-permanent installation. Along with the radio equip-
ment, you need a little furniture and space to put it in. Operating using voice
modes means speaking out loud and probably listening on a speaker. Choosing
an appropriate location for your station can minimize impact on other family
members. For example, a basement shack should not be right under a bed-
room. Garage and attic shacks have wide temperature swings. All in all, a spare
bedroom or dry basement area is about the best place. Try to set up the radio
shack somewhere that is not disruptive and put a good pair of headphones on
your shopping list.

Because most hams operate with external antennas, plan appropriate ways
of getting feedlines to them. What’s going to hold the antennas up? Larger
structures, such as rotatable beams on masts or towers, may need permits
or approvals.
A big part of the amateur service is being available in emergencies. Because
you may lose power when it’s needed most, consider how you might operate
your station with the AC power off. A radio that runs off of 12 volts can run
from a car battery for a while. All your computing gear and accessories also
need power. If you have a generator, consider how you can power your sta-
tion, if necessary.
Mobile operation
The small all-band, multi-mode radios available today can put HF, VHF, and
UHF bands at your fingertips, so you need to consider those possibilities.
Having an efficient HF mobile antenna is harder, so skew your budget for
mobile antennas towards the HF antenna.
Driving your station creates its own set of unique considerations. Because
vehicles come in so many styles, you need to make a custom installation.
Leave some budget for automotive fixtures and wiring. You may find spend-
ing a few dollars to have a professional shop make recommendations about
power wiring and safety, in particular, prudent.
You can get lots of good ideas by reviewing articles and Web sites featuring
mobile operation. I like K2BJ’s Web site (www.k2bj.com), and a number of
links to other good sites is at www.arrl.org/tis/info/HF-Mobile.html.
Portable operation
With many levels of portable — from minimalist backpacking to parking the
RV — you need to consider being able to carry or pack your entire radio sta-
tion, including your power source. Start by assigning yourself a total weight
budget. Get creative on selecting antennas and accessories to maximize your
options for the radio and power.
Some amazingly small radios are available. These radios aren’t always the
easiest to operate, however. If you’re just starting out, you may want to pass
up the smaller radio in favor of a rig that’s easier to operate and has more
features in order to learn more about operating. With more experience, you’ll
know what features you can do without.
If your station or operating time is limited, concentrate on a single band as
you get started. On HF, 14, 17, and 21 MHz are favorites with the low-power
and portable operators. These frequencies are open for a large portion of the
day and the antennas are small enough to make carrying easy. If you like night-
time operating, 7 and 10 MHz are best. On VHF, 50 and 144 MHz are preferred.
Plenty of operators are on those bands which feature interesting propagation.

Operating a hand-held radio
Regardless of what other pursuits you choose in ham radio, you probably
want to have a handheld VHF/UHF radio. They’re just so darn handy! The
hand-held radio can keep you in touch with local family and friends. They’re
very useful on club and personal outings. Many hand-held radios also feature
an extended receive range that may include commercial broadcast stations
or police and fire department bands.
If you’re buying your first hand-held radio, get a simple, single-band model.
You can make a much more informed decision later if you decide to upgrade
to a multi-band model with all the bells and whistles. Simple radios are also
easy to operate. No new radio you can buy will be missing any significant
feature.
If you buy an older used VHF/UHF radio — either hand-held or mobile — be
sure that it has sub-audible tone features built-in. These radios often required
accessory boards or modifications to include the tones. These days, sub-
audible tone is required, and finding the parts to modify an older rig is hard.
Accessories can extend the life and usefulness of a portable radio, such as
the following:
 The flexible rubber duck antenna supplied with hand-held radios is well
suited for portable use, but isn’t as efficient as a full-sized metal antenna.
An external antenna greatly extends the range of a hand-held radio while
at home.
 Use a high-quality, low-loss feedline for cables of more than a couple of
dozen feet. (See the section titled “Feedline and connectors,” later in
this chapter, for more information on feedlines.)
 A speaker-mike combination allows you to control the radio without
having to hold it up to your face.
 A case or jacket protects the radio against the rough-and-tumble nature
of portable use.
 Spare batteries are a must! If you have a rechargeable battery, be sure to
have a spare and keep it charged. A drop-in charger recharges batteries
faster than the supplied wall-transformer model. If the manufacturer
offers one, a battery pack that accepts ordinary AA-cells is good to have,
especially in emergencies when you may not be able to use a charger.
Regardless of what kind of radio you have, be sure to keep a record of model
and serial numbers. Engrave your name and driver’s license number on the
case in an out-of-the-way location. Mobile and portable radios can be lost or
stolen (fate forefend!). Even larger radios sometimes get pressed into service
214
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

on portable expeditions. Protect your investment against theft and loss!
Check your homeowner’s and auto insurance for coverage of radio equipment.
Allocating resources
When you start assembling a station, you have a range of items to obtain. Not
only do you have the radio itself, but antennas, accessories, cables, and
power sources. Table 12-1 shows some estimates of relative costs based on
the type of station you’re setting up. If you pick a radio first, the remaining
four columns give you a rough idea of how much you should plan on spend-
ing to complete the station. These figures are approximate, but can get you
started. I assume all the gear is purchased new.

Choosing a Radio
As you can see in Table 12-1, regardless of what kind of station you plan on
assembling, a new radio consumes at least half of your budget, which is only
appropriate because the radio is the fundamental piece of equipment in ham
radio. You interact with the radio more than any other equipment and a poor
performer is hard to compensate for.
215
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

HF or shortwave radios
HF radios for the home station fall into three basic categories: Basic,
Journeyman, and High-Performance. Modern radios all have perfectly useable
receive and transmit performance. The differences are found as improved
performance in several key areas: ability to receive in the presence of strong-
signals, receive signal filtering and filter control capabilities, coverage of one
or more VHF/UHF bands, operating amenities such as sub-receivers, number
of memories, and built-in antenna tuners to name a few.
 Basic: This radio includes a simplified set of controls with basic receiver
filter and signal adjustments. Controls may be fixed-value with on and off
settings. It also has limited displays and metering, connects to a single
antenna, and has little support for external accessories. A basic radio is
good for a beginning ham and makes a great second or portable radio
later. A computer interface may be available.
 Journeyman: This radio includes all the necessary receive and transmit
adjustments; most with front panel controls. It has an expanded set of
memory, display, and metering functions. You can find models that have
additional bands and support for digital data operations. Internal antenna
tuners are common as are connections for external equipment, such as
transverters and band-switching equipment. A computer interface is avail-
able for control by a computer.
 High-Performance: Extensive set of receive and transmit controls are
available on the front panel or are configurable under a menu system.
A state-of-the-art receiver and sub-receiver are included along with com-
plete interfaces for digital data and computer control. Internal antenna
tuners are standard and some antenna switching is usually provided.
Complete displays and metering, computer-style displays are popular.
Table 12-2 lists some of the more popular candidates in each class. Just
the base models are listed. You may find various suffixes tacked on to indi-
cate enhancements. For example, the IC-746PRO is an enhanced version of
the IC-746, the Elecraft K2 comes in 5-watt and 100-watt output versions,
and the FT-1000 family includes several different variations.

Choosing a filter
In order to keep nearby signals from interfering with the desired signal, a
receiver uses filters. These filters must pass the desired signal while attenuat-
ing (reducing the strength of) unwanted signals just a few hundred Hz away.
For many years, the only filter components able to accomplish this feat were
quartz crystals, so this type of filter is referred to as a crystal filter. A mechani-
cal filter, similar to crystals, uses vibrating discs. Receiving filters are applied
to the radio signal before it is converted to audio. These filters have a fixed
bandwidth (the range of frequencies they can pass, measured in Hz) and
cannot be adjusted. Find more information on filters on the Ham Radio For
Dummies Web site.
Fixed-width filters are available with several bandwidths. A radio is always
shipped with at least one SSB (single sideband) filter installed (HF radios) or
an FM filter (VHF hand-helds and mobiles). The standard filter bandwidth for
HF SSB operation is 2.4 kHz. Filters with widths of 1.5 to 2.0 kHz are available
for operating under crowded conditions with some loss of fidelity. For Morse
code and digital data, the standard filter is 500 Hz wide and is a good option
to select. Narrower filters down to 250 Hz are available. The most common
filter option to buy is the 500 Hz CW filter, followed by a narrow SSB filter.
Some Journeyman and High Performance-class receivers allow filters to cas-
cade (in other words, the filters are used one following the other) at more
than one intermediate stage. If you can afford the extra expense, purchasing
the extra filters can often make a significant difference in receiving ability,
particularly on a crowded band. To see how cascading works, check out the
Ham Radio For Dummies Web site.
217
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

Digital Signal Processing (DSP, the P can also stand for processor) refers to a
microprocessor in the radio running special software that operates on, or
processes, incoming signals, usually on the audio signal before it’s amplified
for output to the speaker or headphones. More advanced DSP can act on the
signals at radio frequencies. DSP can perform filtering functions to remove
off-frequency signals, reduce or eliminate several different kinds of noise, or
automatically detect and remove an interfering tone. Such abilities make DSP
filtering much more flexible than the filtering accomplished by a crystal filter,
but DSP performance is just becoming equivalent to that of a good fixed-width
crystal filter. In general, the higher the number of bits specified for DSP and
the higher the frequency at which the DSP functions are performed, the better
the DSP processing performs. (Look in your radio’s operating manual or prod-
uct specification sheet for more information.)
Mobile and portable HF radios
Since the introduction of the Kenwood TS-50, a gold rush of radios has been
designed for the portable and mobile operator. Each year sees more bands
and better features crammed into these small radios. These radios are quite
capable as base stations if space is limited at home or a dual home/portable
station is desired. Many include coverage of VHF and UHF bands.
Be aware that because they are so small, these rigs have to make some com-
promises compared to the high-performance designs. The operator interface
is, by necessity, menu-driven. This menu-driven interface makes some adjust-
ments less convenient, although the most-used controls remain on the front
panel. The smaller rigs don’t include internal antenna tuners at the 100-watt
output level as the larger rigs do.
Where can you fit a radio in your vehicle or boat? If you have an RV or a
yacht, you may not have a problem, but in a compact car or an 18-foot run-
about, the space issue is quite a challenge. Luckily, many radios designed for
mobile use, such as the radio in Figure 12-1, have detachable front panels,
sometimes called control heads. A detachable panel allows you to put the
body of the radio under the dash or a seat or on a bulkhead. If you share the
car or boat, get agreement on where to place the radio before drilling any
holes.
Table 12-3 includes examples of several popular mobile/portable rigs and
some of their features. Like their larger base station cousins, you have to con-
sider many features and different sets of accessories. Because these radios
are small and not all features have a dedicated front panel control, I recom-
mend that you try one before you buy either at a dealers or with a friend who
owns one.

Digital data on HF
More and more HF radios are providing a connector or two with a digital data
interface to make connecting a personal computer and operating on the digi-
tal modes, such as PSK31 or RTTY, easier. A few even have a built-in data
modem or a terminal node controller (TNC), which is a type of data modem
used for packet radio (see Chapter 11). The key features to look for are acces-
sory sockets on the radio carrying some of the following signals:
 FSK (Frequency Shift Keying): A digital signal at this connector pin
causes the transmitter to output the two tones for frequency-shift
keying, a method of transmitting using two frequencies, usually used
for radioteletype (RTTY).
220
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

 Data In/Out: If a radio has an internal data modem, you can connect
these digital data inputs and outputs to a computer. You may need an
RS-232 (a type of serial communication) converter.
 Line In/Out: Audio inputs and outputs compatible with the signal levels
of a computer’s sound card, this input is used for digital data when a
computer sound card is used as the data modem.
 PTT: The same as the push-to-talk feature on a microphone, this input
allows a computer or other external equipment to key the transmitter.
 Discriminator (sometimes labeled DISC): This input is the unfiltered
output of the FM demodulator. External equipment can use this signal
both as a tuning indicator and to receive data.
To find out how to configure a radio to support digital data, look on the man-
ufacturer’s Web site or ask the dealer for the radio manual. Proper connections
for RTTY (radioteletype) operation, packet radio, and other types of digital
data should be included, and you can determine if your favorite mode is sup-
ported. If the manual doesn’t provide an answer, contact the manufacturer to
see if someone can tell you how to hook up the radio. Digital data Web sites
may also have files on how to interface specific radios to your computer.
Making a decision on amplification
I recommend that you refrain from obtaining an amplifier for HF operations
until you have some experience on the air. You need the extra savvy that
experience provides to add an amplifier and then deal with the incumbent
issues of power, feedlines, RF safety, and interference. The stronger signal
you put out when using an amplifier also affects more hams if misadjusted or
used inappropriately. Like learning to drive, perfecting the basic techniques
is best accomplished before taking hot laps in a stock car.
Most HF radios output 100 watts or more, which is sufficient to do a lot of
operating in any part of the hobby. When do you need a full gallon of 1500
watts output or even 500 to 800 watts? Many circumstances occur in which
the extra punch of an amplified signal gets the job done. DXers use them to
make contact over long paths on difficult bands. A traffic handler’s amplifier
gets switched on when a band is crowded or noisy so that the message gets
through clearly. Digital operators use them to reduce the number of errors in
received data. In emergencies, an amplifier may get the signal through to a
station with a poor or damaged antenna.
HF amplifiers come in two varieties: vacuum tube and solid-state. Tubes are
well suited to the high power levels involved. Solid-state amplifiers, on the
other hand, tend to be more complex, but require no tuning or warm-up; just
221
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

turn them on and go. Tube amplifiers are less expensive per watt of output
power than solid-state amps, but they are larger and tubes are more fragile.
Don’t attempt to use CB “footlocker”-type amplifiers. Not only are these amps
illegal, but they often have serious design deficiencies that result in poor
signal quality.
VHF and UHF radios
Many HF radios also include 50, 144, and 440 MHz operations. The Kenwood
TS-2000 goes all the way to 1200 MHz! This power makes purchasing a second
radio just for VHF/UHF operating less of a necessity for the casual operator.
Many ham radio shacks have an all-band HF/VHF/UHF radio backed up with a
VHF/UHF FM rig for using the local repeaters and packet radio.
VHF/UHF radios that operate in single-sideband (SSB), carrier wave (CW), and
FM modes are known as all-mode or multi-mode to distinguish them from FM-
only radios. If you get serious about operating on those bands and modes,
then you may want to purchase a dedicated radio. VHF/UHF-only multi-mode
rigs are less common than they used to be because many all-band radios now
offer VHF/UHF coverage.
Many of the VHF/UHF all-mode radios have special features, such as full
duplex operation and automatic compensation for transponder offsets, that
make using the amateur satellites easier. (I introduce amateur satellite opera-
tion in Chapter 11.) Satellite operations require special considerations
because of cross-band operation and the fact that they are moving, which
results in a Doppler shift on the received signal.
An all-mode radio can also form the basis for operating on the amateur
microwave bands. Commercial radios are not available for these bands
(900 MHz; 2.3, 3.4, 5.6, 10, and 24 GHz; and up), so you can use a transverter
instead. The transverter converts a received signal on the microwave bands
to 28, 144, or 440 MHz bands where the radio treats it just like any other
signal. Similarly, the transverter converts a low-power (100 milliwatts or so)
output from the radio on back up to the higher band. Bringing the output
signal up to 10 watts or more requires an external amplifier.
FM-only radios
FM on the VHF and UHF bands is used by nearly every ham regardless of
their favorite operating style or mode. A newly minted Technician licensee
can likely use an FM mobile or hand-held radio as his or her first radio. FM
222
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

is available on the all-mode rigs, but because of the mode’s popularity and
utility, FM-only rigs are very popular. FM radios come in two basic styles:
hand-held and mobile. You can use mobile rigs as base stations at home, too.
Hand-held radios
Hand-held radios come in single-band, dual-band, and multi-band models.
With the multi-band radios covering 50–1296 MHz, why choose a lesser model?
Expense, for one thing. The single-band models, particularly for 2-meters, cost
less than half the price of a multi-band model. You do the lion’s share of operat-
ing on the 2-meter (VHF 144–148 MHz) and 70-cm (UHF 430–440 MHz) bands, so
the extra bands may not get much use.
You can expect the radio to include as standard features encoding and decod-
ing of CTCSS sub-audible tones (tones used to restrict access to repeaters),
variable repeater offsets, at least a dozen memory channels, and a DTMF
keypad for entering control tones (similar to the tones available on a touch-
tone telephone). A rechargeable battery and simple charger come with the
radio. (I discuss repeater operation in Chapter 9.)
Extended-coverage receiving is a useful feature. I find being able to listen to
broadcast FM and the low-VHF land mobile (public safety agencies, paging,
and businesses use) bands around 2-meters is very useful. In addition, TV
channels 2 through 13 can also receive between 54 and 216 MHz. That’s a
nice emergency feature, as well as entertaining.
What are your power output needs? The tiny credit-card size radios are con-
venient, but don’t pack much of a punch. Unless you live in an area with
excellent repeater coverage, insufficient power leaves you out of touch, per-
haps when you really need it. Get a radio with at least 1 watt of output and
pick up a spare battery, too.
Base and mobile radios
Mobile radios have a similar set of features as hand-held radios regarding
memories, scanning, and controls. The more powerful transmitters used with
an external antenna extend your range dramatically. Receivers in mobile
radios often have better performance than those in hand-held radios — able
to reject the strong signals from land mobile dispatch and paging transmitters
on adjacent frequency bands. Information about how receivers perform in
such conditions is available in product reviews in magazines such as CQ and
QST, on the ARRL Web site (www.arrl.org), and on Web sites such as www.
eham.net and www.qrz.com. Your own club members may have valuable
experience to share, because they operate in the same places as you!
223
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

You can often use mobile radios for digital data operation on the VHF/UHF
bands, particularly packet. When limited to 1200 baud data, as modem tech-
nology has advanced, hams have moved to use 9600 baud data. If you plan on
using your mobile rig for digital data, make sure it is data-ready and rated for
9600 baud without modification.
Some rigs claim to be APRS or GPS compatible — what does that mean? First,
check out the descriptions of the Automatic Position Reporting System (APRS)
in Chapter 11. Location information from a GPS receiver is transmitted by
packet to a network of APRS computers over VHF radio. A radio compatible
with APRS has a serial port for the GPS receiver and an internal packet TNC
that can send and receive APRS packets without any other external devices.
VHF/UHF amplifiers
Increasing the transmitted power from an all-mode, hand-held, or even small
mobile radio is common. Amplifiers can turn a few watts of input into more
than 100 watts of output. Solid-state commercial units are known as bricks
because they are about the size of large bricks with heat sinking fins on the
top. A small amp and external antenna can greatly improve the performance
of a hand-held radio so that you don’t need a separate mobile rig.
Amplifiers are either FM-only or SSB/FM models. Amplifiers just for FM use
cause severe distortion of a single-sideband signal. An amplifier designed for
SSB use is called a linear amplifier and SSB/FM models have a switch to
change between the modes. You can amplify Morse code signals in either
mode, with more gain available in the FM mode.
RF safety issues are much more pronounced above 30 MHz because the body
absorbs energy more readily at those frequencies. An amplifier outputs
enough power to pose a hazard, particularly if you use a beam antenna. Don’t
use an amplifier at 50 MHz or above if the antenna is close to people. Revisit
your RF safety evaluation (see the Ham Radio For Dummies Web site) if you
plan on adding a VHF/UHF amplifier to your mobile or home station.
Making a selection
Dozens of hand-held and mobile radios are for sale, so use a checklist of fea-
tures to help you decide on a model. Note the capabilities you want as well
as the ones that fall into the nice-to-have category. A checklist and compari-
son table is available on the Ham Radio For Dummies Web site to help you
sort through the blizzard of features. The blank spaces are for you to add
capabilities.
224
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Choosing an Antenna
I can’t say which is more important: the radio or the antenna. Making up for
deficiencies in one by improving the other is difficult. A good antenna can
make a weak radio sound better than the other way around. You need to give
your antenna selection at least as much consideration as the radio.
This section touches on a number of types of useful and popular antennas. If
you want to know more about antennas and want to try building a few your-
self, you need more information. I can think of no better source for that infor-
mation than The ARRL Antenna Book, now in its 20th edition. Not only a good
ham resource, many professional antenna designers have a copy, too. Highly
recommended! I include a list of useful antenna design books and Web sites in
Appendix B.
HF antennas
At HF, antennas can be fairly large. An effective antenna is usually at least 
1⁄4-wavelength in some dimension. On 40-meters, for example, a 1⁄4-wavelength
vertical antenna is a metal tube or wire 33 feet high. At the higher HF frequen-
cies, antenna sizes drop to 8–16 feet, but are still larger than even a big TV
antenna. Your physical circumstances have a great effect on what antenna
you can put up. Rest assured that a large variety of designs are available to
get you on the air.
Wires, verticals, and beams are the three basic HF antennas used by hams all
over the world. You can build all these antennas with common tools or pur-
chase them from the many ham radio equipment vendors.
Wire antennas
The simplest wire antenna is a dipole, which is a piece of wire cut in the
middle and attached to a feedline, as shown in Figure 12-2. The dipole gives
much better performance than you may expect from such a simple antenna.
To construct a dipole, use 10- to 18-gauge copper wire. It can be stranded or
solid, bare or insulated. When completed, its length should be:
Length in feet = 468 / frequency of use in MHz
This formula accounts for a slight shortening effect that makes a 
1⁄2-wavelength of wire slightly shorter than a 1⁄2-wavelength in air. For example,
a dipole for 21.1 MHz is 468 / 21.1 = 22.2 feet long. Allow an extra 18 inches on
each end for attaching to the end insulators and tuning and another foot
(6 inches × 2) for attaching to the center insulator. The total length of wire
you need is 22.2' + 18" + 18" + 12" = 26.2'.
225
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

To assemble a dipole, follow these steps:
1. Cut the wire exactly in the middle and attach one piece to each end
insulator, just twisting it back on itself for the initial check.
2. Attach the other end to the center insulator in the same way.
3. Attach the feedline at the center insulator and solder each connection.
4. Attach some ropes and hoist it up in the air.
5. Check the dipole.
Make some short, low power transmissions to measure the SWR
(standing wave ratio) as explained in your radio’s operating manual.
The SWR should be somewhere less than 1.5 to 1 on the frequencies
you wish to use.

6. If the SWR is low enough at too high a frequency or is lowest at the
high end of the band, loosen the connections at the end insulators and
lengthen the antenna by a few inches on each end.
If the frequency of lower SWR is too low, shorten the antenna by the
same amount.
7. When you adjust the antenna length so that the SWR is satisfactory,
make a secure wrap of the wire at the end insulators and trim the
excess.
You made a dipole! You can follow the same steps, except vary the lengths,
for most simple wire antennas.
You can connect the dipole directly to the transmitter using coaxial cable
and use the dipole on the band at which it is 1⁄4-wavelength long or any odd
number of 1⁄2 wavelengths. For example, the 66-foot long 7 MHz dipole works
well on the 21 MHz band, too.
Other common and simple wire antenna designs include:
 Inverted-V: A dipole supported at its midpoint with the ends angling
down at up to 45 degrees. This antenna only requires one support and
gives good results in nearly all directions.
 Full-wavelength loop: Attach a feedline at the middle of the loop’s
bottom and erect the loop so that it is vertical. The feedline then works
best broadside to the plane of the loop. These antennas are larger than
the dipoles, but radiate a little more signal in their favored directions.
 Multi-band dipoles: Wires fed at the center with open-wire or ladder-line
feedline and used with an antenna tuner to cover several bands. These
are usually not 1⁄2-wavelength long on any band and so are called doublets
to distinguish them from the 1⁄2-wavelength long dipoles.
 Trap dipole: Uses some appropriately placed components to isolate por-
tions of the antenna at different frequencies so that the dipole acts like a
simple 1⁄2-wavelength dipole on two or more bands.
 The random-length wire: Attach some open-wire feedline 15 to 35 feet
from one end and extend the wire as far and high as you can. A couple of
bends won’t hurt. You have to convert the feedline to coaxial cable using
a balun or antenna tuner. (I describe these on the Ham Radio For Dummies
Web site.) The random wire’s performance is hard to predict, but is an
excellent back-up or temporary antenna.
For more information on these and many other antennas you can build, check
out some of the antenna references listed in Appendix B. If you don’t have the
perfect backyard to construct the antenna of your dreams, don’t be afraid to

experiment. Get an antenna tuner (or use the one in your radio) and put up
whatever you can. You can even bend wires or arrange them at strange angles.
Antennas want to work!
Vertical antennas
Vertical antennas are nearly as popular as wire antennas. The 1⁄4-wavelength
and the 1⁄2-wavelength antennas are two common designs. Verticals don’t
require tall supports, keep a low visual profile, and are easy to move or carry.
Verticals radiate fairly equally in all horizontal directions, so they are consid-
ered omnidirectional antennas.
The 1⁄4-wavelength design is a lot like a 1⁄2-wavelength dipole cut in half and
turned on end. The missing part of the dipole is supplied by an electrical
mirror of sorts called a ground screen or ground-plane. A ground screen is
made up of a dozen or more wires stretched out radially from the base of the
antenna and laid on top of the ground. The feedline connects to the vertical
tube (it can also be a wire) and to the radials, which are all connected
together. The 1⁄4-wavelength verticals are fairly easy to construct and, like
dipoles, work on odd multiples of their lowest design frequency.
The 1⁄2-wavelength verticals are about twice as long as their 1⁄4--wavelength
counterparts, but do not require a ground screen. The lack of a ground
screen means that you can mount them on masts or structures away from the
ground and are ground-independent. The feedline is connected to the end of
the vertical, but requires a special impedance matching circuit to work with
low-impedance coaxial feedlines. Several commercial manufacturers offer
ground-independent verticals and many hams with limited space or opportu-
nities for traditional antennas make good use of them.
Both 1⁄4-wavelength and 1⁄2-wavelength verticals can work on several bands
through the use of the similar techniques used in wire antennas. Commercial
multi-band verticals are available that you can use on up to nine of the
HF bands.
Beam antennas
Any antenna that uses more than one element to focus or steer its listening
and transmitting capabilities toward one direction is called a beam, which is
short for beamforming. Beams can be as simple as two wires or as compli-
cated as more than a dozen pieces of tubing.
The most popular type of beam antenna is called a Yagi, after Japanese scien-
tists, Doctors Yagi and Uda, who invented the antenna back in the 1920s. The
Yagi consists of two or more conducting elements (tubing or wires) parallel
to each other and approximately 0.1 wavelength apart. The element that the
feedline connects to is known as the driven element. Other elements called
228
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

reflectors and directors are cut to specific lengths and spaced to reflect or
direct the energy in a particular direction. Reflectors and directors, because
they direct the energy without being directly connected to the feedline, are
known as parasitic elements, and Yagi antennas are sometimes referred to as
parasitic arrays. The most common ham Yagi today is a three-element design
(a reflector, a driven element, and a director) that works on three popular
ham bands (20, 15, and 10-meters) and so is called a tri-bander. Yagis are also
made from wires at lower frequencies. Figure 12-3 shows a three-element Yagi
beam on a 55-foot mast whose lowest operating frequency is 14 MHz.
Other beams are made from square or triangular loops. They work on the
same principle as the Yagi, but with loops of wire instead of straight elements
made from rod or tubing. Square-loop beams are called quads and the trian-
gles are called delta loops.
You may encounter another type of beam that looks like an oversized TV
antenna with many angled elements. These beams are log-periodics, or logs,
and the large number of antenna elements enables the antenna to function
over all bands in a certain range, just as TV antennas can receive many chan-
nels. Hams use logs to cover a range of bands (typically 20, 17, 15, 12, and 10-
meters) with a single antenna.

Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

Whereas wire antennas have a fixed orientation and verticals radiate equally
in all horizontal directions, a beam antenna made from aluminum tubing can
be rotated. The ability to rotate the antenna allows the ham using a beam
antenna to concentrate a signal or reject an interfering signal in a certain
direction. You can place small HF beams on inexpensive masts or roof-top
tripods, although they overload most structures designed for TV antennas.
You also need a rotator that mounts on the fixed support and turns the beam.
You can control the rotator from inside the shack and have a meter to indicate
direction. (See the section, “Supporting Your Antenna,” later in this chapter.)
Most hams start out with a wire or vertical antenna. After you operate for a
while, the signals you hear on the air give you a good idea of what antennas
are effective. After you have some on-the-air experience, you can make a deci-
sion as to whether you need a beam antenna.
VHF/UHF antennas
Most antennas used above 50 MHz at fixed stations are either verticals or
beams. Verticals are used almost exclusively for FM operation, while beams
are used for VHF/UHF DX-ing (contacting a distant station) on SSB and CW.
FM operating is done with vertically polarized antennas because of the mode’s
beginnings in the mobile radio industry. Antennas on vehicles are much sim-
pler to mount vertically. In order to avoid cross-polarization losses (see the
sidebar “Antenna polarization”), the base antennas were also verticals. This
convention is nearly universal. Even if a beam antenna accesses a distant
repeater, its elements are mounted vertically.
SSB and CW operators, on the other hand, use horizontal polarization. Many
of the VHF and UHF propagation mechanisms respond best to horizontally
polarized waves. If you have an all-mode radio and want to use it for both FM
and SSB/CW, you need both vertically and horizontally polarized antennas
available.
A popular and inexpensive vertical antenna is the simple quarter-wave whip,
or ground-plane, antenna, which works the same as its larger HF cousin. Many
hams build a 19-inch long 2-meter ground-plane as a first antenna project.
You can extend the vertical to 5⁄8-wavelength versions, which offer a slightly
stronger signal.
A 5⁄8-wavelength 2-meter vertical makes a dandy 1⁄4-wavelength 6-meter verti-
cal without any modifications!
230
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Because of the reduced antenna size at higher frequencies, the Yagi antennas
used by VHF/UHF DXers can have many more elements than at HF. Five to 7
element beams are common on 50 MHz and more than 20 elements are often
seen at higher frequencies. These very high-gain antennas also have a narrow
beamwidth, which is too narrow for most casual operating. If you choose to
use a beam on these bands, 3 to 5 elements is a good choice on 6-meters and
5 to 12 elements at higher frequencies. These antennas are small enough to
mount and turn using heavy-duty TV antenna hardware.
Mobile and portable antennas
For VHF, antennas for FM use are almost always vertical. The wavelength at
these frequencies is such that a full-sized antenna is the norm. Mobile HF
antennas, however, are generally reduced-size versions of verticals used at
231
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air
Antenna polarization
Antennas radiate and receive electromagnetic
fields composed of an electric and a magnetic
field. Electrons in the conducting surfaces of an
antenna move back and forth (creating a cur-
rent) in the same direction as the oscillations of
the electric field. This action causes currents to
flow in the antenna, which either radiates a
signal if the field is applied from a transmitter via
a feedline or receives a signal if the field is
caused by a distant transmitter.
The alignment of a radio wave’s electric field
with respect to the Earth’s surface is called its
polarization. Because the electric field and
electron movement are parallel, an antenna’s
polarization is the same as the direction in
which its conducting surfaces are arranged.
Vertical antennas are vertically polarized, for
example. Most Yagi antennas are horizontally
polarized.
For the most efficient communications, you
must orient the receive and transmit antennas
so that the electromagnetic fields from each
antenna are aligned. If the antennas aren’t
aligned, then the electric field from the trans-
mitter does not make the receiving antenna’s
electrons move to make a current flow into the
feedline. Such antennas are cross-polarized
and the resulting loss of signal can be substan-
tial. Polaroid sunglasses take advantage of the
fact that most reflected light considered to be
glare is horizontally polarized. By using verti-
cally polarized plastic in the lenses, you can
eliminate glare by cross-polarization.
Polarization is most important at VHF and UHF
where signals usually arrive with their polar-
ization largely intact. On the HF bands, the
ionosphere scrambles the polarization so
that relative polarization is much less impor-
tant. Polarization does affect received signal
strength, however, and deep signal fades
caused by cross-polarization are common at HF.

fixed stations. Horizontally polarized mobile HF antennas are rare due to
their size and mechanical considerations. The challenge for mobile HFers is
to get the most efficiency out of a short antenna.
You can mount mobile antennas as removable or permanent fixtures. The
most easily removed antennas are the mag-mount models that use a magnetic
base to hold themselves to a metal surface. Mag-mount antennas are avail-
able from HF through UHF. The drawback is that the installation isn’t as clean
as a permanently mounted antenna. Trunk-mount antennas for VHF and UHF
are semi-permanent and look better. Drilling a hole in your car for a perma-
nent mount looks best of all. All three options are fairly close in performance.
Whichever method you choose, be sure you can remove the antenna from
the mount to deter theft and for clearance, such as in a car wash. You can
generally route antenna cables under trim, carpet, and seats.
For HF, many mobile stations use the “Hamstick”-type antennas attached to a
mag-mount, as seen in Figure 12-4. These antennas are wire coiled on fiber-
glass tubes about 4 feet long, with a stainless-steel whip attached at the top.
The antennas work on a single band and are sufficiently inexpensive that you
can carry a whole set in the car. They require that you change the antenna
when changing bands. Another design uses resonators attached to a perma-
nent base to operate on different bands. You can attach several resonators at
once so that several bands are used without changing the antenna. The res-
onators and fiberglass whip antennas use a standard 3⁄8-24 threaded mount.
An adjustable design has become popular in recent years with a moving top
section that allows the antenna to tune over nearly any HF frequency. These
antennas are known as screwdriver antennas because they use DC motors sim-
ilar to those in battery-powered electric screwdrivers. In order of expense,
the Hamstick-type antennas are the most inexpensive and the screwdriver
antennas the most expensive. Performance varies dramatically depending on
mounting and installation, so guaranteeing good results for any of the styles is
difficult.
At VHF and UHF, portable antennas are very small, light, and easy to pack. At
HF, however, the larger antennas are more difficult to deal with. You can try
a lightweight wire antenna if you can find a way to support it above ground.
Vertical antennas need a sturdy base and usually a ground system. Telescoping
antennas may be an option, and you can use the mobile Hamstick-type whips
with a few radial wires.
An antenna that does not present a low SWR (signal wave ratio, a measure of
RF energy reflected back to the transmitter by the antenna) requires a tuner
for the transmitter to output full power, adding weight and expense. The
smaller coaxial feedlines, such as RG-58 types, also have higher losses. Try
out the performance of your antenna and feedline before taking off on a
major adventure. Avoid unpleasant surprises on the back roads!
232
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Feedline and connectors
Gee, how tough can picking a feedline be? It’s just coax, right? Not really, and
you may be surprised at how much feedline can affect your signal, both on
transmit and receive. When I started out, I used 100 feet of RG-58 with a 66-
foot dipole that I tuned on all bands. I didn’t know that on the higher bands I
was losing almost half of my transmitter output and received signals in the
coax! The 50-foot piece I was using on my 2-meter antenna lost an even higher
fraction of the signals.
While losing 50 percent or 3dB (decibels) is only about one-half of an S-unit
(S-units are a measure of signal strength, roughly equivalent to 6dB each), I
lost a few contacts when signals were weak or the band was noisy. To make
up that loss with an amplifier costs around $300. Changing antennas to a
beam with 3dB of gain costs at least that much, not counting the mast and
rotator. That makes the extra $20 to $25 cost of using RG-213 cable look like a
pretty good bargain!

Table 12-4 compares several popular feedlines in terms of their relative cost
(based on RG-58C/U) and the loss for a 100-foot section at 30 MHz and 150
MHz. The loss is shown in dB and in S-units on a typical receiver, assuming
that one S-unit is equivalent to 6dB.

Answering the decibel
Time for a refresher on decibels? Decibels,
abbreviated dB, are used to measure a ratio of
two quantities in terms of factors of 10. A
change of a factor of 10 (from 10 to 100 or from
1 to 0.1) is a change of 10dB. Increases are pos-
itive and decreases are negative. You can use
the following formula to calculate dB for
changes in power and voltage:
dB = 10 log (power ratio)
dB = 20 log (voltage ratio)
Decibels add if ratios are multiplied together.
For example, two doublings of power (x 2 x 2)
is 3 dB + 3 dB = 6 dB. A gain of 20 can also be
thought of as x 10 x 2 = 10 dB + 3 dB = 13 dB.
If you memorize these dB-ratio pairs, you can
save yourself a lot of calculating, because a
precise dB calculation isn’t needed very often.
Powerx2=3dB
Powerx1/2=-3dB
Powerx4=6dB
Powerx1/4=-6dB
Powerx5=7dB
Powerx1/5=-7dB
Powerx8=9dB
Powerx1/8=-9dB
Powerx10=10dB
Powerx1/10=-10dB
Powerx20=13dB
Powerx1/20=-13dB
Powerx50=17dB
Powerx1/50=-17dB
Powerx100=20dB
Powerx1/100=-20dB
A change of one receiver S-unit represents
approximately 6dB.

The moral of the story is to use the feedline with the lowest loss you can
afford. Open-wire feedline is a special case because you add an impedance
transformer or tuner to present a 50-ohm load to the transmitter, incurring
extra expense and adding some loss.
To save a lot of money on feedline, buy it in 500-foot spools from a distribu-
tor. If you can’t afford to buy the entire spool, share the spool with a friend or
two. Splitting the expense is an excellent club buy and can save more than 50
percent over buying cable 50 or 100 feet at a time. Do the same for coaxial
connectors.
Beware of used cable unless the seller is completely trustworthy. Old cable is
not always bad, but can be lossy if water has gotten in at the end or from
cracks or splits in the cable jacket. If the cable is sharply bent for a long
period, the center conductor can migrate through the insulation to develop a
short or change the cable properties. (Migration is a particular problem with
foam-insulation cables.)
Before buying used cable, examine the cable closely. The jacket should be
smooth and shiny, with no obvious nicks, dents, scrapes, cracks, or deposits
of adhesive or tar (from being on a roof or outside a building). Slit the jacket
at each end for about 1 foot and inspect the braid, which should be shiny and
show no signs of corrosion or discoloration whatsoever. Slip the braid back.
The center insulator should be clean and clear (if solid) or white if foam or
Teflon synthetic. If the cable has a connector on the end, checking the cable
condition may be difficult. Unless the connector is newly installed, you
should replace it, so ask if you can cut the connector off to check the cable.
If you can’t cut it off, you probably shouldn’t take a chance on the cable.
The standard RF connectors used by hams are BNC, UHF, and N-type connec-
tors. BNC connectors are used for low power (up to 100 watts) at frequencies
through 440 MHz. UHF connectors are used up to 2-meters and can handle
full legal power. N connectors are used up through 1200 MHz, can handle full
legal power, and are waterproof when properly installed. (Photos or drawings
of connectors are shown in vendor catalogs, such as The RF Connection cata-
log at www.therfc.com.)
Good-quality connectors are available at low prices, so don’t scrimp on this
important component. A cheap connector works loose, lets water seep in,
physically breaks, or corrodes, eating up your valuable signals. By far, the
most common connector you’ll work with is the PL-259, the plug that goes on
the end of coaxial cables. By buying in quantity, you can get silver-plated,
Teflon-insulated connectors for just over $1 each, a bargain compared to the
price if you buy them individually. Avoid the shiny nickel-plated connectors
as they are difficult to solder.
To crimp or not to crimp? You can install a crimp-on connector quickly and
get reliable service if you use it indoors in low-humidity, mild temperature
235
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

environments. Crimping tools, or crimpers, are available for less than $50. If
you have a lot of connections to make, a crimp-on connector may be a good
choice. However, a properly soldered, silver-plated connector outperforms a
crimped connector and can be used outside, too.
Supporting Your Antenna
Antennas come in all shapes and sizes — from the size of a finger to behe-
moths that weigh hundreds of pounds. The one thing that all antennas have
in common is that they need to be clear of obstacles and kept away from
ground level, which is where most obstacles are.
Before you start mounting your antenna, take a minute to review some ele-
mentary safety information for working with antennas and their supports.
The short article at www.arrl.org/tis/info/pdf/0106091.pdf points out
a few of the common pitfalls in raising masts and towers. For working with
trees, aside from common sense about climbing, you may want to consult
with an arborist.
Antennas and trees
Although Marconi used a kite for his early experiments, a handy tree is prob-
ably the oldest antenna support. A tree often holds up wire antennas, which
tend to be horizontal or use horizontal support ropes. The larger rotatable
antennas and masts are rarely installed on a tree, even on a tall, straight
conifer, because of the mechanical complexity, likelihood of damage to the
tree, and mechanical interference between the antenna and tree.
Nevertheless, for the right kind of antennas, a tree is sturdy, nice to look at,
and free! The goal is to get a pulley or halyard into the tree at the maximum
height. If you are a climber (or can find someone to climb for you), you can
place the pulley by hand. Otherwise, you have to figure out some way of get-
ting a line through the tree so you can haul up a pulley. You may be able to
just throw the antenna support line over a branch. Bear in mind that when a
line is pressing against the bark of a tree, the tree can rub and chafe against
the line until the line breaks. (This catastrophe always happens at night, in a
storm, or right before an important contact.) If the line stays intact, the tree
tries to grow around the line, creating a wound, which makes raising or low-
ering the antenna impossible.
If you intend for the tree to support an antenna permanently, bringing in
an arborist or a tree service professional to do the job right, using sturdy,
adequately rated materials, is worth the expense. The Radioworks company
has a good introduction to antennas in trees at www.radioworks.com.html.
236
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Masts and tripods
A wooden or metal mast is an inexpensive way to support an antenna up to
30 feet above ground. If you are handy with tools, making a home-brew mast
is a good project and numerous articles about their construction are in the
ham magazines. Masts are good candidates to hold up wire HF antennas and
VHF/UHF antennas, such as verticals and small beams. If you are just sup-
porting a VHF or UHF vertical, you won’t need a heavy support and can prob-
ably make a self-supporting mast that doesn’t need guy wires. However, if you
have high winds or the mast is subjected to a side load (such as for a wire
antenna), then it needs to be guyed.
One commercially available option is the telescoping push-up mast designed to
hold small TV antennas and often installed on rooftops. Push-ups come in sizes
up to 40 feet with guying points attached. You can also construct masts by
stacking short sections of metal TV antenna mast, but you have to add your
own guying points. You can’t climb either telescoping or sectional masts, so
mounting the antenna and then erecting the whole assembly is up to you. You
can also mount a section or two of stacking mast on a chimney in order to sup-
port a small vertical. Push-up and TV masts are available along with all the nec-
essary mounting and guying materials from RadioShack, hardware, and home
improvement stores.
One step beyond the mast is the roof-mount tripod. The lighter tripods are
used for TV antennas and can hold small amateur antennas. Larger tripods
can handle mid-sized HF beams. Tripods are good solutions in urban areas
and in subdivisions that may not allow a ground-mounted tower. Tripods are
available from several tower and antenna manufacturers.
Towers
By far the sturdiest antenna support is the tower. Towers are available as self-
supporting (unguyed), multisection crank-up, tilt-over, and guyed structures
with heights of 30 feet and up. They are capable of handling the largest anten-
nas at the highest heights, but they are also substantial construction projects,
usually requiring a permit to erect. Table 12-5 lists several manufacturers of
towers.
The most common ham tower is a welded lattice tower. It is built from 10-foot
sections of steel tubing and welded braces and you must guy or tie it to a sup-
porting structure, such as a house, at heights of 30 feet or more. A modest
concrete base of several cubic feet is required to provide a footing. Lattice
towers for amateur use are between 12 and 24 inches on a side and can be
used to construct towers well over 100 feet high. Lattice towers are suffi-
ciently strong to hold several large HF beam antennas, if properly guyed. 
237
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

Tilt-over towers are lattice towers hinged in the middle so that the top sec-
tions can pivot towards the ground using a winch. Because of mechanical
considerations, tilt-overs are limited to less than 100 feet in height.
Crank-up towers are constructed from telescoping tubing or lattice sections. A
hand-operated or motorized winch raises and lowers the tower with a cable
and pulley arrangement. A fully nested crank-up is usually 20 to 25 feet high,
reducing visual impact to the neighborhood, and you can climb it to work on
the antennas. Crank-ups also usually have a tilting base that aids in transport-
ing and erecting the tower. Crank-ups are unguyed and so depend on a mas-
sive concrete foundation of several cubic yards to keep their center-of-gravity
below ground level to prevent tipping over when fully extended. You can
install crank-ups in small areas where guying is not possible; they are avail-
able in heights of up to 90 feet.
Self-supporting towers are triangular in cross section, are constructed of truss-
like sections like lattice towers, and rely on a large concrete base for center-
of-gravity control. They are simpler and less-expensive than crank-ups.
Available at up to 100 feet, they have similar carrying capacity to lattice
towers. Mounting antennas along the length of a self-supporting tower is
more difficult than for a lattice tower with vertical supporting legs.

Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Be extremely careful when buying a used tower or mast. Unless it has been in
storage, exposure to the elements can cause corrosion, weakening welds and
supporting members. If disassembled improperly, the tower can be damaged
in subtle ways difficult to detect in separate tower sections. A tower or mast
that has fallen is often warped, cracked, or otherwise unsafe. Have an expert
accompany you to evaluate the material before you buy.
You can construct self-supporting towers from unorthodox materials such as
telephone poles, light standards, well casing, and so on. If it can hold up an
antenna, rest assured that a ham has used it to do so at some time. The chal-
lenge is to transport and erect the mast, then climb it safely and create a
sturdy antenna mounting structure at the top.
Regardless of what you decide to use to hold up your antennas, hams have a
wealth of experience to share in forums such as the TowerTalk e-mail list. You
can sign up for TowerTalk at www.contesting.com. The topics discussed
range from mounting verticals on a rooftop, to which rope is best, to giant HF
beams, and how to locate True North. The list’s membership includes
experts who can handle some of the most difficult questions.
Is it a rotor or rotator?
A rotor is a part of a helicopter and has nothing whatever to do with ham
radio. A rotator, on the other hand, is a motorized gadget that sits on a tower
or mast and points antennas in different directions. Rotators are rated in
terms of wind load, which is measured in square feet of antenna surface. If
you decide on a rotatable antenna, you need to figure out its wind load in
order to determine the size rotator it requires. Wind load ratings for antennas
are available from the antenna manufacturer. The most popular rotators are
made by Hy-Gain (www.hy-gain.com) and Yaesu (www.yaesu.com).
You need to be sure that you can mount the rotator on your tower or mast;
some structures may need an adapter. Antennas mount on a pipe mast that
then sits in a mast clamp on top of the rotator. If you mount the rotator on a
mast, as on the left in Figure 12-5, you must mount the antenna at the top of
the rotator to minimize side loading. In a tower, the rotator is attached to a
rotator plate (a shelf inside the tower for the rotator to sit on) and the mast
extends through a sleeve or thrust bearing (a tube or collar that hold the mast
centered above the rotator), as at the center and right of Figure 12-5. Because
using a bearing in this way prevents any side loading of the rotator, you can
mount antennas well above the tower top if the mast is sufficiently strong.
An indicator assembly called a control box, which you install in the shack, con-
trols the rotator. The connection to the rotator is made with a multi-conductor
cable. Install the feedlines to the antennas in such a way so that they can
accommodate the rotation of the antennas and mast.
239
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

Used rotators can be risky purchases. They are always installed in exposed
locations and wear out in ways not visible externally. Even if the rotator turns
properly on the bench, it may jam, stall, or slip when under a heavy load.
Either buy a new rotator or get a used one from a trusted source for your first
installation.
Radio accessories
You can buy or build hundreds of different gadgets to enhance whatever style
or specialty you choose. Here’s some information on the most common
accessories that you need to get the most out of your station.
Mikes, keys, and keyers
Most radios come with a hand microphone, although if you buy a used radio,
the hand mike may be long gone or somewhat worn. The manufacturer-
supplied hand mikes are pretty good and are all you need to get started.
After you operate for a while, you may decide to upgrade.

If you’re a ragchewer, some microphones are designed for audio fidelity with
a wide frequency response. Net operators and contesters like the hands-free
convenience of a headset with an attached boom mike held in front of your
mouth. Hand-held radios are more convenient to use with a combined
speaker-microphone combination accessory that plugs into your radio and
clips to a shirt pocket or collar. Your radio manufacturer may also offer a pre-
mium microphone as an option or accessory for your radio. Heil Sound
(www.heilsound.com) manufacturers a wide range of top-quality micro-
phones and headsets.
The frequency response of a microphone can make a big difference on the
air. If you operate under crowded conditions, the audio from a microphone
whose response emphasizes the mid-range and higher frequencies is more
likely to cut through the noise. Some microphones have selectable frequency
responses so that you can have a natural-sounding voice during a casual con-
tact, then switch to the brighter response for some DX-ing. If you’re not sure
which is best, ask the folks you contact or do an over-the-air check with a
friend who knows your voice.
Morse code enthusiasts have thousands of keys to choose from, spanning
over a century of history (see Chapter 10 for more info). Beginners often
start with a straight key and then graduate to an electronic keyer and a
paddle. If you think you’ll use CW a lot, I recommend going the keyer/paddle
route right away. Many rigs now include a keyer as a standard option. You
can plug the paddle into the radio and you’re on your way! CW operators
tend to find paddle choice very personal, so definitely try one out before you
buy. A hamfest often has one or more key-bug-paddle collectors and you can
try many different styles. The ham behind the table is likely to be full of good
information, as well.
If you decide on an external keyer, you can choose from kits and finished
models. Programmable memories are very handy for storing commonly sent
information, such as your call sign or a CQ message. Sometimes I put my
keyer in beacon mode to send a stored CQ message repeatedly to see if
anyone is listening on a dead band. (If everybody listens and nobody trans-
mits, the band sounds dead, but may be open to somewhere exciting.)
A number of computer programs send code from the keyboard. Browse to
www.ac6v.com/morseprograms.htm for an extensive listing of software.
What is a voice keyer? That sounds like an oxymoron! A voice keyer is a
device that can store short voice messages and play them back into your
radio as if you were speaking. Some are standalone units and some use a
sound card. Voice keyers are handy for contesting, DX-ing, calling CQ, and
so forth. Models also store both CW and voice messages, such as the MJF
Contest Keyer (www.mfjenterprises.com) and the Super Combo Keyer
(www.arraysolutions.com).

Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

Antenna tuners
While your new radio may be equipped with an antenna tuner, a number of
situations can occur in which you need an external unit. Internal tuners have
a somewhat limited range that fits many antennas. Antennas being used far
from their design or optimized frequency often present an impedance that
the rig’s tuner can’t handle. If balanced feedlines are used, you may need a
tuner that can handle the change from coaxial cable to open-wire feedlines.
Tuners are available in sizes from tiny, QRP-sized units to humongous, full-
power boxes larger than many radios. Table 12-6 lists a few of the manufac-
turers offering an assortment of tuners. If you decide to purchase a tuner,
choose one that’s rated comfortably in excess of the maximum power you
expect to use. I highly recommend getting one with the option to use bal-
anced feedlines. The ability to switch between different feedlines and an SWR
meter (which measures reflected RF power) are nice-to-have features.
They’re called “antenna tuners” but they don’t really “tune” an antenna at all!
A more accurate name for these gadgets is an impedance matcher. The imped-
ance matcher acts like an electrical gearbox to transform whatever imped-
ance exists at the end of the feedline to the 50 ohms radios like to see. Your
antenna doesn’t even know it’s there. This subject is discussed in detail in
both The ARRL Antenna Book and The ARRL Handbook. In addition, the online
article, “Do You Need an Antenna Tuner?” from QST, is online at www.arrl.
org/tis/info/tuner.html.

Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Along with the tuner, you need a dummy load. The dummy load is a large
resistor that can dissipate the full power of your transmitter. The MFJ 260C
can dissipate 300 watts, which is adequate for HF transceivers. High-power
loads, such as the venerable Heathkit Cantenna or MFJ 250, immerse the
resistor in a cooling oil. The dummy load helps minimize your transmitter
causing interference during tune-up. HF dummy loads may not be suitable
for use at VHF or UHF, so check the frequency coverage specification before
you buy.
Computers in the Shack
As with just about every other activity, a computer can be involved. Ham
radio is no different and has embraced computers more intimately than in
most hobbies. Originally just used as a replacement for the paper logbook,
the computer has evolved nearly to the point of becoming a second op: con-
trolling radios, sending and receiving CW, and linking your shack to thou-
sands of others through the Internet.
PC or Mac or . . . ?
Most ham shack computers are Windows-based machinery. The vast majority
of software available for ham applications runs on the Win9x/2000/XP operat-
ing systems, with a healthy number of MS-DOS applications that run in MS-
DOS windows on Win9x/2000.
243
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air
Why is a rotator’s wind load rated in square feet?
A rotator’s job is to turn antennas and hold them
in place against the pressure of the wind. The
wind’s pressure tries to turn the antenna against
the rotator’s braking mechanism. The rotator
has to maintain control of the antenna when the
brake is off and the antenna is turning against
the wind. Both holding and turning the antenna
require the rotator to exert torque on the mast
that holds the antennas. As long as the rotator
can exert more torque than the wind on the
antenna, all is well. Torque caused by the wind
on the antenna is difficult to specify exactly, but
if a maximum wind speed is assumed, then
torque is directly related to antenna area, which
is easy to specify. Thus, rotators are rated in
square feet of wind load. If multiple antennas
are mounted on a single rotator, you must add
their individual wind loads together. Rotators for
amateur service are available with ratings start-
ing at 3 square feet.

Linux has an increasing number of adherents, particularly among the digital
mode enthusiasts. Here are a few Web sites that focus on Linux software:

 AC6V.com: www.ac6v.com/software.htm#LIN

The Macintosh computing community is making additional inroads to ham
radio software and programs are available for all of the common ham radio
uses available. The Ham-Mac mailing list is full of information for Mac fans
(mailman.qth.net/mailman/listinfo/ham-mac). You can find Macintosh
ham radio software at dogparksoftware.com and www.blackcatsystems.
com. A useful Web site that is devoted to bringing together Macintosh com-
puters and ham radio is www.machamradio.com.
Regardless of what platform and operating system you prefer, software tools
and programs are available to help you enjoy any type of operating you like.
While some software is supplied by commercial businesses, the amateur
community has developed an amazing amount of shareware and freeware.
Hams freely contribute their expertise in any number of ways, and develop-
ing software is a very popular activity.
Digital modes
Operation on most of the digital modes is rapidly converging on the sound
card as the standard device to send and receive data. With a simple audio
and transmit control interface, your computer and radio form a very power-
ful data terminal. Proprietary protocols, such as PACTOR II and Clover,
require special hardware and software available from the protocol developer.
I list specific software packages for the popular digital modes in Chapter 11.
MFJ Enterprises (www.mfjenterprises.com) and West Mountain Radio
(www.westmountainradio.com) both manufacture popular data interfaces.
If you choose to use an external multi-mode controller for the digital modes,
such as the Timewave PK232 or DSP599 (www.timewave.com), Kantronics KAM
(www.kantronics.com), or MFJ 1278B, you only need a terminal program,
such as Hyperterm, which is built into Windows, or Symantec’s Procomm-Plus
(www.symantec.com). Numerous other terminal programs are optimized for
ham radio digital data (which I list in Chapter 11).
244
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Radio control
Radios are now provided with an RS-232 control interface through which you
can monitor and control nearly every radio function. That flexibility has led
to a number of radio control programs that put the front panel on a com-
puter. Some radio manufacturers have a radio control package that you can
purchase or download with the radio. A number of third-party programs inte-
grate with logging software. If control interfaces are interesting to you, join a
user’s group for your radio on Usenet or via one of the ham radio portals (see
Chapter 3).
Hardware considerations
Outside of computation-intensive applications, such as antenna modeling or
high-performance data modems, you don’t need to own the latest and great-
est speed-demon computer. If you’re thinking about upgrading a home com-
puter, a computer that’s a couple of years old does just fine in the ham shack.
Furthermore, the flood of cheap, surplus computers available for a song
means that you can dedicate a computer to its own specific task, such as run-
ning a packet node or monitoring an APRS Web site, so as not to tie up your
main computer. Even a clunky old 486 DOS does just fine monitoring 1200-
baud packet data, for example.
If you decide to purchase a new computer for the shack, be aware that the
standard interface in ham radio for data and control is the RS-232 serial port.
These ports are being phased out on new computers in favor of USB 2.0.
(Serial ports are now referred to as legacy ports.) Integrating a USB-only PC
into the ham shack means that you either have to purchase a serial port
expansion card or use USB-to-RS-232 converters. The serial port expansion
cards likely have fewer compatibility and driver issues, but the USB convert-
ers are easier to install.
Computer RF interference can also be an issue in the ham shack. The two
main sources of interference are the monitor and data cables. If you have a
noisy monitor — one that emits a lot of RF energy — the interference can be
very tough to get rid of because shielding in monitors is almost non-existent.
Ferrite cores are available from RadioShack (part numbers 273-104 and
273-105) that you can place on cables to choke off the interfering signals.
Place the cores as close as possible to the connector on the device generat-
ing the interference. One core may be required at each end of the cable.
Ground the metal case of any computing equipment, as well. 
245
Chapter 12: Getting on the Air

Buying New or Used Equipment
New equipment is always safest for a neophyte and it has that great new
radio smell, too! If the equipment doesn’t work, you have a service warranty
or the customer service representatives can help you out. Sales personnel
can help you with information about how to set up a radio or any accessories
and may even have technical bulletins or application guides for popular
activities. To find out where to buy new gear, get a copy of QST, CQ, or
WorldRadio. The major dealers all run ads every month and some are virtual
catalogs. For the smaller and local stores, check out the ARRL Technical
Information Service’s Web page at www.arrl.org/tis/tisfind.html.
While buying new equipment is safe, used gear is often an excellent bargain.
Hams always love a bargain. You can find nearly any imaginable piece of gear
with a little searching on a number of online swap sites, including eBay. (Look
for these sites through the portals and reflectors listed in Chapter 3.) I like to
buy and sell through the ham radio Web sites — my favorite is the Classified
pages on the eHam.net portal (www.eham.net/classifieds). The ARRL and
QRZ.com both have for-sale ads and quite a few other sites are springing up
all the time. Enter ham trade or ham swap into an Internet search engine. As
with shopping at hamfests, get help from an experienced friend before
buying.
What about buying through mail order? Internet and toll-free telephone num-
bers make shopping for rock-bottom prices easy, but shopping by mail order
has some drawbacks. The first is that you have to pay for shipping, which
could add tens of dollars to your purchase. You may also have to pay for
shipping to return equipment for service. Second, the local radio store is a
valuable resource for you. RadioShack probably doesn’t carry replacement
parts for your WhizBang2000 nor does it probably have a new battery pack
for that 10-Band PocketMaster. When you are stuck in the middle of an
antenna or construction project, you don’t want to have to stop and wait for
UPS to deliver materials. My advice: Buy some things through the mail and
some locally, balancing the need to save money against the need to support a
local store.
Upgrading Your Station
Soon enough, usually about five minutes after your first QSO, you start think-
ing about upgrading your station to hear better or be stronger. Keep in mind
the following tips when the urge to upgrade overcomes you. Remember the
old adage, “You can’t work ’em if you can’t hear ’em!”
246
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

 The least expensive way to improve your transmit and receive capabili-
ties is with better antennas. Dollar for dollar, you get the most improve-
ment from an antenna upgrade. Raise them before making them larger.
 Only consider more power after you improve your antennas. Improve
your hearing before extending the range at which people can hear you!
An amplifier doesn’t help you hear better at all.
 Buying additional receiving filters for your radio is a whole lot cheaper
than a new radio.
 The easiest piece of equipment to upgrade in the station is the multi-
mode processor between your ears. Before deciding that you need a
new radio, be sure you know how to operate your old one to the best of
your abilities. Improving your knowledge is often the cheapest and most
effective improvement you can make.
By taking the improvement process one step at a time and by making sure
that you improve your own capabilities and understanding, you can achieve
your operating goals quicker and get much more enjoyment out of every ham
radio dollar.

Chapter 13
Organizing Your Shack
In This Chapter
 Devising your ham shack layout
 Staying safe with RF and electrical currents
 Grounding your equipment
A
well-organized shack provides a number of benefits for the occasional
and serious ham enthusiast alike. You spend many hours in the shack, 
so why not make the effort to make your experience as enjoyable as possible?
This chapter explains how to take care of the two most important inhabitants
of the shack — the gear and you. The order of priority is up to you.
Designing Your Ham Shack
One thing that you can count on is that your first station layout will prove to
be unsatisfactory. It’s guaranteed! Don’t bolt everything down right away.
Plan to change the layout several times as you change your operating style
and preferences.
You’ll spend a lot of time in your shack, no matter where it’s located, so
making the operating comfortable and efficient is important. By thinking
ahead, you can avoid some common pitfalls and save money, too!
Keeping a shack notebook
Before you unpack a single box or put up one shelf in your shack, you should
start a shack notebook to record how you put your station together and to
help you keep your station operating. The notebook can be a simple, spiral-
bound book of notepaper or a three-ring binder. A bound book has the advan-
tage that its pages can’t get blown out of the binder due to an unexpected
gust of wind.

Sketch out your designs before you begin building, make lists of equipment
and accessories, and record the details as you go along. For example, if you
hook up two pieces of gear with multi-conductor cable, write down the color
of each wire and what it’s attached to. You won’t remember it later and the
written list saves you tons of time and frustration.
After you have the station working, keep track of the gear you add and how
you connect it. Record how your antennas work at different frequencies.
Write down the wiring diagram for the little gadgets and adapters. Don’t rely
on memory! Taking a few minutes to record information saves the time ten-
fold later.
Building in ergonomics
Spending hours in front of a radio or workbench is common, so you need to
have the very same concerns about ergonomics in your radio shack that you
do at work. You want to avoid awkward positions, too-low or too-high furni-
ture, and harsh lighting, to name just a few. By thinking about these things in
advance, you can avoid any number of personal irritations entirely!
The focal point
Remember your main goals for the station. Building a station for HF ragchewing
on phone, monitoring VHF FM repeaters, or using the digital modes requires a
different approach for each. Whatever you plan on doing, you probably use one
piece of equipment more than half the time. That equipment ought to be the
focal point of how you arrange your station. The focal point can be the radio, a
computer keyboard and monitor, or even a microphone or Morse code paddle.
Paying attention to how you use that specific item pays dividends in operating
comfort.
The computer
You may be building a radio station, but in many instances, you use your
computer more than the radio! Certainly, the monitor is the largest piece of
equipment at your operating position. Follow the guidelines for comfortable
computer users. Position the desktop at the right height for extended periods
of typing or, if possible, use a keyboard tray. Buy a high-quality monitor and
place it at a height and distance for relaxed viewing. Figure 13-1 shows a few
ways of integrating a monitor with radio gear.
Monitors mounted too far above the desk give you a sore neck. If you place
the monitor too far away, your eyes hurt. Placed too far to the left or right,
your back hurts. Now is the time to apply computer ergonomics and be sure
that you don’t build in aches and pains as the reward for the long hours you
spend at the radio.
250
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

The radio
Radios (and operators) come in all different shapes and sizes, which makes
giving hard and fast rules difficult. For example, HF operators tend to do a lot
of tuning, so placement of the radio is very important. VHF-FM operators do
less tuning, so the radio doesn’t have to be as close to the operator. Placing
your most-used radio off to one side of the keyboard or monitor probably is
the most comfortable. If you are right-handed, have your main radio on your
left and your mouse or trackball to the right. If left-handed, vice versa.
The larger radios usually have adjustable feet or a folding wire support called a bail.
The bail folds flat against the underside of the rig for transport. Adjust the bail or feet
to raise the front of the radio to a comfortable viewing angle. You should be able to
see all of the control labels without having to move your head up or down.
The operating chair
A key piece of support equipment, so to speak, is the operator’s chair. I am
always astounded to visit state-of-the-art radio stations and find a cheap,
wobbly, garage-sale office chair at the operating positions. Even though thou-
sands of dollars were spent on electronics, the operator doesn’t get the most
out of the radios because of the chair.

Chapter 13: Organizing Your Shack

A good shack chair is a roll-around office style chair with good lower-back
support and plenty of padding in the seat. An adjustable model is best,
preferably one that you can adjust with levers while sitting down. You may
find that chairs with arms make sitting close to the operating desk difficult
without leaning on your arms or stressing your lower back. If possible,
remove the arms if you like sitting close to the operating table or desk.
The best shack chairs are the top-of-the-line secretarial models made for long
days of easy swiveling and rolling. You won’t regret spending a little extra on
the chair. Your body is in contact with your chair longer than any other piece
of equipment. You can find good bargains on used chairs at used office furni-
ture stores, listed in the Yellow Pages.
The desk and shelves
The top surface of your operating desk is the second-most contacted piece of
equipment. As is the case with chairs, many choices are available for desks
suitable for a ham shack. Consider height and depth when looking at desks.
Before choosing a desk, you need to decide if the radio sits on the desk or on
a shelf above it. Figure 13-2 illustrates the basic concerns. Do you like having
your keyboard on the desk? You need to be comfortable sitting at your desk
with your forearms resting comfortably on it. If you tune a radio a lot, such as
for most HF stations, avoid arrangements that cause your arm to rest on the
elbow or on the desk’s edge for prolonged periods. Nothing is more painful!
Make sure you have enough room for wrist support if using the keyboard is
your main activity.

Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

The most common height for desks is between 28 and 30 inches from the
floor. A depth of 30 inches is about the minimum if a typical transceiver that
requires frequent tuning or adjustment is sitting directly on it. You need at
least 12 inches between the front edge of the desk and the tuning knob. With
your hand on the most frequently used radio control, your entire forearm
needs to be on the desktop. If the radio is sitting on a shelf above the desk,
be sure that it’s close enough to you that tuning is comfortable and doesn’t
require a long reach. Be sure you can also see the controls clearly.
For small spaces, computer workstations may be a good solution. You proba-
bly have to add some shelves, but the main structure has all the right pieces
and may be adjustable, to boot. One drawback is that they don’t have much
depth for arm support, if your operating style requires it.
Ham shack examples
Because every station location and use is going to be different, I can’t provide
hard and fast rules with which everyone must comply. The most helpful guid-
ance I can provide is by way of example. Then you can decide what works for
you. The goal of this section is to get you thinking about what works for you,
not to suggest that you duplicate these stations exactly.
Paul Beringer NG7Z lives in a condominium where space is at a premium. He
likes low-power HF contesting and DX-ing. His simple station, shown in Figure
13-3, resides in a self-assembly computer workstation with a fold-down front
desk.
 The radio and accessories are stacked where Paul can easily see and
operate them.
 The fold-down surface provides enough desk surface for wrist support
when using a CW paddle.
 A slide-away drawer holds the computer keyboard and mouse below the
desk at a comfortable height.
 The monitor is close enough to be easy on the eyes and within a com-
fortable viewing angle of the radio.
 Lighting is from behind the operating position to avoid glare.
Many hams like a soft light in the shack because it is less distracting and
makes reading the indicators and displays on the radios and accessories
easier.
Jack W1WEF has a larger area available for his station, adding a second trans-
ceiver and an amplifier to the mix. Jack spends a lot of time on the bands as
you can tell from Figure 13-4. He often has two radios on at the same time.

 The computer monitor is right in the middle at a height that minimizes
head and eye movement between the radios and software.
 Shelves above the monitor hold accessories and equipment that require
few adjustments.
 Placing the amplifier on one side, antenna switches and rotators in the
middle, and the power supply and speaker on the right minimize confu-
sion and group similar controls together.
 Everything that requires frequent adjustment is within easy reach. No
side-to-side movement is required.
Put paper labels on the front panel tuning controls of an amplifier to make
changing frequencies easy without putting a powerful tune-up signal on the
air. Easily changing frequencies minimizes stress on the amplifier and inter-
ference to other stations.
I use a computer cart as the foundation for my station, shown in Figure 13-5.
I purchased a basic cart. Then I added plywood to extend the surface of the
shelves to either side. A vertical piece of plywood on the left-hand side pro-
vides a mounting surface for switches to change antennas. I added another
shelf at the cart’s base for the computer and power supplies. Because I do
almost all my work from the keyboard, it is at the most comfortable height
for me with the main radio right behind it for easy reach.

Chapter 13: Organizing Your Shack

I placed the equipment that I don’t adjust as much, including antenna rota-
tors and VHF packet equipment, on a rolling cabinet to the left of the main
station. The advantage of the rolling platforms is that I can move them easily
to get access to the cables, something difficult to do with a fixed desk close
to the wall.
Mobile and portable station examples
Getting a good ham station installed in a car has never been easier! In the past
few years, manufacturers have taken the “all-band” radio design to new heights.
Take the Icom IC-706mkIIG (or IC-706) for example. A radio only 6.6" x 2.3" x 7.9"
and weighing only 5.5 pounds is capable of developing 100 watts output on all
amateur bands between 1.8 and 50 MHz, 50 watts on 144 MHz, and 20 watts on
432 MHz. This radio and similar offerings from other manufacturers have
changed mobile and portable operation forever.
The compact size of modern radios allows for very sleek installations in vehi-
cles. You can even place radios with detachable front panels in the trunk or
under a seat!
Dwayne Trego N8KDY took advantage of the space his unused ashtray was
occupying in his car’s dashboard. Removing the ashtray left plenty of room
for his VHF/UHF mobile rig as you can see in Figure 13-6. Better yet, he even
uses the ashtray cover to hide the rig when he’s not in the car! Unless you’re
a ham, you probably wouldn’t even notice the radio.
If you plan to operate from your RV, take a few pointers from the clean layout
in Figure 13-7 by Pete Wilson K4CAV. When Pete stops at a campground, he
sets up a station right at the driver’s position. Pete not only has his HF trans-
ceiver mounted right on the dashboard, but it’s sitting on top of a mobile
amplifier for an extra-powerful signal. When in motion, all of this gear is
safely stowed.
Poorly secured radio gear can be lethal in an accident. Please don’t go 
mobile without making sure your radios are securely mounted. Take care to
keep cables and microphones away from air-bag deployment areas, as well.
Anything in motion inside the vehicle is a hazard to you and your passengers.
Maybe you’d like something less tied to an automobile or RV. Well, how about
a bicycle mobile station?
The bicycle mobile station, shown in Figure 13-8, is from Ben Schupack
NW7DX, who constructed it during his senior year of high school. Ben uses
a recumbent bike with an SGC-2020 HF QRP rig mounted on the handlebars.
A whip antenna and batteries are mounted behind the rider.

Building in RF and Electrical Safety
Whatever type of station you choose to assemble, you must keep in mind
basic safety principles. Extensive literature is available for hams (see the side-
bar “Sources of RF and electrical safety information,” later in this chapter).
Don’t think that you can ignore safety in the ham shack. Sooner or later you
get bit and equipment is damaged or someone gets hurt. Take a little time to
review the safety fundamentals.
Basic safety
Safety is not particularly complicated. Mainly, being safe consists of consis-
tently observing just a few simple rules. These tips can keep you out of more
trouble than almost any others:
 Know the fundamental wiring rules for AC power. The National
Electrical Code (NEC) contains the rules and tables that help you do a
safe wiring job. The NEC, as well as numerous how-to and training refer-
ences, is available in your local library or at home improvement centers.
If you are unsure of your skills, hire an electrician.
 Deal with DC power, especially in a car, carefully to avoid short-
circuits and poor connections. Either situation can cause expensive
fires, and poor connections result in erratic operation of your radio. 
As with AC power, read the safety literature or hire a professional
installer to do the job right.

Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

 Think of your own personal and family safety when constructing your
station. Don’t leave any kind of electrical circuit exposed where some-
one can touch it accidentally. Use a safety lockout (devices that prevent 
a circuit breaker from being closed, energizing a circuit) on circuit break-
ers when you’re working on wiring or equipment. Have fire extinguishers
handy and in good working order. Show your family how to remove
power safely from the ham shack.
Lightning
The power of lightning and its destructive potential is awesome. If you live in
an area where lightning strikes are a possibility, take the necessary steps to
protect your station and home. These steps can be as simple as disconnecting
your antenna feedlines when not in use or you may decide to use professional-
level bonding and grounding. Whatever you choose, do the job diligently and
correctly.
RF exposure
Along with the possibilities of direct shocks due to contact with live electri-
cal circuits, the signals your transmitter generates are also hazardous. The
human body absorbs RF energy, turning it to heat. RF energy varies with fre-
quency, being most hazardous in the VHF and UHF regions. A microwave
oven operates at the high end of the UHF frequencies, for example.

Sources of RF and electrical safety information
Be responsible. Before you expose yourself
to danger, check out these inexpensive safety
references.
 The American Radio Relay League (ARRL)
promotes safety for all manner of Amateur
Radio activities. You can find excellent dis-
cussions of ham shack hazards and how to
deal with them in the ARRL Handbook and
the ARRL Antenna Book. A downloadable
article is available in PDF format at www.
arrl.org/tis/info/pdf/AntBk.pdf.
 For electrical safety issues relating to power
circuits, the Electrical Safety Forum at
electrical-contractor.net/ESF/
Electrical_Safety_Forum.htm is a
good source of information.
 Brush up on lightning and grounding issues
in a series of Engineering Notes on the
Polyphaser Web site (www.polyphaser.
com). Click the Tech Info tab.
 The ARRL publication RF Exposure and You,
the ARRL Handbook, and the ARRL Antenna
Book all discuss RF exposure safety issues.
The ARRL provides a series of articles and
guidelines covering all these safety issues at
www.arrl.org/tis/tismenu.html.

Amateur signals are usually well below the threshold of any harmful effects,
but can be harmful when antennas focus the signal in such a way that you’re
exposed for a long period of time. High-power VHF and UHF amplifiers can
definitely be hazardous if you don’t handle them with caution.
A comprehensive set of RF Safety guidelines is available. As you construct
your own station, do a station evaluation to be sure you’re not causing any
hazards due to your transmissions. The Ham Radio For Dummies Web site
has a downloadable form and procedure for you to use in evaluating your
station’s RF safety.
First aid
Just like engaging in any other hobby that involves the potential for injury,
having some elementary skills in first aid is important. Have a first-aid kit in
your home or shack and be sure other family members know where it is and
how to use it. Training in first aid and CPR is always a good idea for you and
your family, regardless of your hobby.
Grounding Power and RF
Providing good grounding — for both AC and DC power as well as for the
radio signals — is very important for a trouble-free ham shack. Although
proper power grounding is fairly straightforward for AC and DC power,
grounding for the radio signals in a ham station is a different problem alto-
gether. You have to deal with both.
Grounding for AC and DC power
Most people hear the word ground and think, “connected to the Earth.” What
the term really means, though, is the lowest common voltage for all equipment.
For example, the Earth is at zero voltage for power systems. Grounding is really
the process of making sure different pieces of equipment have the same volt-
age reference.
In AC and DC power wiring, grounding provides safety by connecting exposed
conductors, such as equipment cases, either directly to the Earth or to a zero-
voltage point, such as a building frame. Guiding any current away from you in
the event of a short circuit between the power source and the exposed conduc-
tors provides safety. By keeping all equipment at the same low voltage, no cur-
rent flows between pieces of equipment if they touch each other either directly
or if you touch both pieces simultaneously.
260
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Power safety grounding uses a dedicated conductor — the so-called “third
wire.” In the home, three-wire AC outlets connect the ground pin to the
home’s ground at the master circuit-breaker box. Because the frequency of
AC power is very low, the length of the ground wire doesn’t matter. It must
only be heavy enough to handle any possible fault currents.
In DC systems, because of the generally low voltages involved (less than 30
volts), power safety is less concerned with preventing shock than with mini-
mizing excessive current and poor connections. Both create a lot of heat and
are significant fire hazards. You must pay careful attention to conductor size
and keeping connections tight and clean. As with AC power grounds, the
length of the conductor is not an issue; only its current-carrying capacity.
Grounding for RF signals
The techniques that work for AC and DC power safety often do not work well
for the high frequencies that hams use. For RF, a wire doesn’t have to be very
long before it starts acting like an antenna or transmission line. For example,
at 28 MHz, an 8-foot piece of wire is about 1⁄4-wavelength long. It can have high
voltage on one end and very little voltage on the other!
Because constructing a wiring system that has one common low-voltage point
at RF for all the equipment is difficult, station builders use the more general def-
inition of grounding, keeping all equipment at the same voltage. You can create
an RF ground by using a single heavy wire or strap under or behind the equip-
ment and tying each piece of gear to it with a short piece of strap or copper
braid, as shown in Figure 13-9. Ham gear usually has a ground terminal just for
this purpose.
Copper strap is sold at hardware and roofing stores as flashing. Avoid paying
top dollar by finding a surplus metals dealer and poking around. A copper
strip or sheet is often available in a wide variety of gauges and sizes. I was
fortunate to find a heavy bar, predrilled with evenly spaced holes that made 
a dandy ground bus (see Figure 13-10). Use your imagination — all you need
is material that is wide and is easy to make good electrical contacts with.
You don’t have to buy expensive braid if you have some lengths of old coax-
ial cable around. As long as the coax is not waterlogged or corroded, the
braid makes a fine ground strap. Lightly score the cable’s outer plastic jacket
and peel it off the cable. Push the ends of the braid sleeve together so that 
it loosens slightly. By pushing the braid off the center insulation, you can
remove, flatten, and use it for grounding. The remaining wire is good high-
voltage wire or you can use it for power supply applications.

Housekeeping (Logs and QSLs)
In This Chapter
 Maintaining a log
 Picking out a QSL card
 Mailing QSL cards
B
efore you make any contacts with your new station, plan ahead for the
housekeeping chores that go with a new shack. For the ham, keeping a
log of station operations and sending QSLs for contacts are the paperwork
that finishes the job. In this chapter, I show you what to put in your log and
how to put together a QSL card.
Keeping a Log
Keeping a detailed log is no longer a requirement, but a lot of good reasons
exist to keep track of what you do on the ham bands. The main log is a nice
complement to the shack notebook (see Chapter 13), and you’ll find it valu-
able in troubleshooting efforts and equipment evaluation.
Updating your little black radio book
Your station log can literally be a notebook or binder with handwritten
entries for every contact. (Figure 14-1 shows a typical format for paper log-
books.) Be sure to record the basics:
 Time: Hams keep time in UTC (or World Time) for everything but local
contacts and radiogram identification (see Chapter 10).
 Frequency: Just recording the band in either MHz or wavelength is suffi-
cient (for example, 20-meters or 14 MHz).
 Call sign: Record each station you contact.

Those three pieces of information are enough to establish the who, when, and
where of ham radio. Beyond the basics, you probably want to keep track of the
mode you used, the signal report you gave and received, and any personal
information about the other operator.
Don’t limit yourself to just exchanging the information recorded in your log-
book or logging program. Another person is on the other end of the QSO with
lots of interesting things to say!
Keeping your log on a computer
If you’re an active ham, I highly recommend keeping your log on a computer.
The logging program makes looking up previous contacts with a station or
operator easy. You can also use your logging program like a Web blog as a day-
to-day radio diary to keep track of local weather, solar and ionospheric condi-
tions, equipment performance, and behavior. The programs can also export
data in standard file formats such as ADIF (Automated Data Interchange
Format). For mobile or portable operation, portable logging programs, such 
as GOLog (home.earthlink.net/%7Egolog/), run on a 
Palm-OS PDA.

Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Selecting a QSL Card
QSL cards are the size of a standard postcard featuring an attractive graphic
or photo with the station’s call sign. Information about a contact is written on
one side. The QSL is then mailed directly to the other station or through an
intermediary as described below. One of my favorite activities, exchanging
QSL cards allows you to claim credit for contacts in order to receive awards,
but most hams just do it for fun.
You can find many varieties of QSLs, but three very basic rules can help make
the exchange as quick and error-free as possible. Figure 14-2 illustrates the
following:
 Have your call sign and QSO information on one side so that the receiver
doesn’t have to look for it.
 Print your call sign and all contact information in a clear and easy-to-
read typeface.
 Beyond your mailing address, make sure the physical location of the
station is shown, including county (for U.S. stations) and four-digit grid
square.
Figure 14-2:
My club’s
QSL card.
265
Chapter 14: Housekeeping (Logs and QSLs)

You can find advertisements for QSL printers in the classified section of ham
magazines or you can roll your own card with a laser or inkjet printer.
Follow these suggestions for sure-fire accuracy:
 Double check the date and time of your contact. Date and time are
frequent sources of error. Start by making sure your own clock is set
properly. Use UTC or World Time for every QSL except those for local
contacts.
 Use an unambiguous format for date. Is 5/7/99 May 7th or July 5th?
The date is crystal clear if you show the month with a Roman numeral,
as in 7/V/99, or spell the month out as in 5 Jul 99.
 Use heavy black or blue ink pen that won’t fade over time like colored
inks. Never use pencil.
Sending and Receiving QSLs
After you fill out your QSLs, then what? Depending on where the cards are
going, you have several options that trade postage expense against turn-
around time. By following the appropriate rules for each method, you can
get a high return rate for your cards.
QSL-ing direct 
The quickest (and most expensive) option for sending QSLs is to send the
cards direct, meaning directly to other hams at their published addresses.
This method ensures your card gets to the recipient faster than any other
method and usually results in the shortest turnaround time. Include the
return postage and maybe even a SASE (self-addressed, stamped envelope).
This method costs more for you, but makes things as easy as possible for the
other ham to get a return card on its way.
Postal larceny is generally not a problem in the wealthier industrialized coun-
tries, but it is an enormous problem elsewhere. An active station can make
hundreds of contacts per week, attracting unwelcome attention when many
envelopes start showing up with those funny number-letter call sign things.
Don’t put any station call signs on the envelope if you have any question
about the reliability of the postal service. Make your envelope as ordinary
and as thin as possible.
266
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Sending via managers
To avoid poor postal systems and cut postage expenses, many DX stations
and nearly all DX-peditions use a QSL manager. The manager is typically in a
country with good postal service and the return rate is nearly 100 percent.
QSL-ing via a manager is just like QSL-ing direct. If you don’t include return
postage and an envelope to a manager for a DX station, you’ll likely get your
card back via the QSL bureau (see the next section), which takes a while.
Managers can be located by a QSL manager Web site such as www.qslinfo.
de or www.eham.net. The DX newsletters listed in Appendix B are also good
sources of information.
If you send your QSL overseas, be sure to do the following:
 Use the correct Global Air Mail Letter Post rate from the U.S. Post Office
Web site (www.usps.com/common/category/postage.htm).
 Ensure air mail service with an Air Mail sticker (free at the post office),
an air mail envelope, or an Air Mail/Par Avion ink stamp on the envelope.
 Include return postage from sources such as William Plum DX Supplies
(e-mail Bill at plumdx@msn.com) or the K3FN Air Mail Postage Service
(users.net1plus.com/ryoung/index.htm).
An International Reply Coupon or IRC is redeemable for one unit of
unregistered air mail postage. You can purchase IRCs at the post office
or redeem one from overseas. If the clerk is not familiar with IRCs, sec-
tion 372.1 of the USPS manual explains how to handle IRCs.
You’ll hear “send 1 (or 2) greenstamps” for return postage. A greenstamp is a
$1 bill. Take care that currency is not visible through the envelope. In some
countries, non-domestic currency is illegal, so check before sending it
through the mail.
Bureaus and QSL services
All that postage can mount up pretty quickly. A much cheaper (but slower)
option exists: the QSL bureau system. You should use this method when the
DX station says, “QSL via the bureau” or on CW, “QSL VIA BURO.” The QSL
bureau system operates as a sort of ham radio post office, which allows hams
to exchange QSLs at a fraction of the cost of direct mail.
Bundle up all of your DX QSLs (you still have to send domestic cards directly)
and send them to the Outgoing QSL Bureau. There the QSLs are sorted and
267
Chapter 14: Housekeeping (Logs and QSLs)

sent in bulk to the Incoming QSL Bureaus around the world. The cards are then
sorted and distributed to individual stations. The recipients then reciprocate
and send reply cards back in the other direction. Go to www.arrl.org/qsl/
for more details. To get your cards, you must keep postage and envelopes in
stock at the Incoming QSL Bureau. Then, when you least expect it, a fat pack-
age of cards comes in the mail. What fun!
An intermediate route is the WF5E QSL Service (www.qsl.net/wf5e/), which
forwards QSLs to foreign and U.S. managers at the cost of a dollar for a few
cards. You send outbound cards directly to WF5E and your return cards come
through the bureau system. Compared to direct mail, the WF5E QSL Service is
still a good bargain.
QSL-ing electronically
Hey, this is the twenty-first century, isn’t it? Why aren’t hams sending QSLs
electronically? Well, some hams are, although it’s relatively new. Hams
exchange cards on two different sites: eQSL and the ARRL’s Logbook of the
World (LOTW).
eQSL (www.eqsl.net/qslcard/) was the first electronic QSL system and is
extremely easy to use. Its site has a tutorial slideshow that explains just how
the eQSL works and how to use it.
The ARRL’s LOTW (www.arrl.org/lotw/) is a little more complicated to use.
You’re required to provide proof of license and your identity in order to receive
a digital signature certificate. (For information about how digital signatures work,
look up references on Public Key Infrastructure technology.) The digital sig-
nature authenticates your contact information. LOTW does not generate or
handle physical QSL cards; it only provides verification of QSOs for award
purposes.

H
am radio is a lot more fun if you know how your radio works. You don’t
have to be an electrical engineer or a whiz-bang programmer, but to
keep things running smoothly and deal with the inevitable hiccups, you need
a variety of simple skills. As you tackle them, you’ll find that you’re having
fewer problems, getting on the air more, and having better luck making con-
tacts. Trying new modes or bands will also be much easier for you.
To help you get comfortable with the hands-on part of ham radio, this chap-
ter provides some guidance in the three parts of keeping a ham radio station
on the air: making sure your radio doesn’t break, figuring out what is broken
when it does, and fixing the broken part.
Before delving into the insides of your equipment, please take a minute and
visit Chapter 13. Ham radio is a hobby, but electricity doesn’t know that. I’d
like to keep all of my readers for a long, long time, so follow one of ham
radio’s oldest rules, “Safety First!”
Acquiring Tools and Components
In order to take care of your radio station, you’ll need to have some basic
tools. It doesn’t take a chest of exotic tools and racks of parts. In fact, you
probably have most of the tools already. How many you need is really a
question of how deeply you plan on delving into the electronics of the hobby.

You have the opportunity to do two levels of work: maintenance and repair
or building.
Maintenance tools
Maintenance involves taking care of all your equipment, as well as being able
to fabricate any necessary cables or fixtures to put it all together. Figure 15-1
shows a good set of maintenance tools. Having them on hand allows you to
do almost any electronics maintenance task.
 Wire cutters: Use a heavy-duty pair to handle big wire and cable, and a
very sharp pair of diagonal cutters, or dikes, with pointed ends to handle
the small jobs.
 Soldering iron and gun: You need a model with adjustable temperature
and interchangeable tips. Delicate connectors and printed-circuit boards
need a low-temperature, fine-point tip. Heavier wiring jobs take more
heat and a bigger tip. The soldering gun should have at least 100 watts
of power for antenna and cable soldering. Don’t try to use a soldering
gun on small jobs.
 Terminal crimpers: Regular pliers on crimp terminals don’t do the job;
the connection pulls out or works loose and you spend hours chasing
down the loose connections. Learn how to install crimp terminals and
do it right the first time with the right tools.
 Head-mounted magnifier: Electronic components are getting smaller 
by the hour, so do your eyes a favor. Magnifiers are often available at
craft stores. You can also find clamp-mounted swing-arm magnifier-light
combinations.
 Volt-ohmmeter (VOM): If you can afford it, get one with diode and transis-
tor checking, a continuity tester, and maybe a capacitor and inductance
checker. Some models also include a frequency counter, which can come
in handy.
You also need to have spare parts on hand. Start by having a spare for all
your equipment’s connectors. Look over each piece of gear and note what
type of connector is required. When you’re done, head down to the local elec-
tronics emporium and pick up one or two of each type. To make up coaxial
cables, you need to have a few RF connectors on hand of the common types:
UHF, BNC, and N.
You often need adapters when you don’t have just the right cable or a new
accessory has a different type of connector. Table 15-1 shows the most
common adapter types. You don’t have to get them all at once, but this list 
is good to have at a hamfest or to use when you need an extra part to make
up a minimum order.

that’s mounted on equipment. A male connector is one in which the signal
contacts are exposed pins (disregard the outer shroud or shell). A female
connector has recessed sockets that accept male connector pins.

Chapter 15: Hands-On Radio

Along with adapters and spare parts, you should have on hand some
common consumable parts:
 Fuses: Have spares for all of the fuse sizes and styles your equipment
uses. Never replace a fuse with a higher value fuse.
 Electrical tape: Use high-quality tape such as Scotch 33+ for important
jobs, such as outdoor connector sealing, and get the cheap stuff for tem-
porary or throwaway jobs.
 Fasteners: Purchase a parts-cabinet assortment with #4 through #10
screws, nuts, and lockwashers. Some equipment may require the smaller
metric-sized fasteners. You need 1⁄4-inch and 5⁄16-inch hardware for anten-
nas and masts.
 Interference suppressors: Having a couple of filters and ferrite cores
around allows you to address interference problems quickly.
Cleaning equipment is an important part of maintenance and you need the
following items:
 Soft bristle brushes: Old paint brushes (small ones) and toothbrushes
are great cleaning tools. I also keep a round brush for getting inside
tubes and holes.
 Metal bristle brushes: Light duty steel and brass brushes clean up oxide
and corrosion. Brass brushes do not scratch metal connectors, but do
damage plastic knobs or displays. Don’t forget to clean a brush of corro-
sion or grease after the job.
 Solvents and sprays: I have a bottle or can of lighter fluid, isopropyl
alcohol, contact cleaner, and compressed air. Lighter fluid cleans panels
and cabinets gently and quickly, as well as removes old adhesive and
tape. Always test a solvent on a hidden part of a plastic piece before
applying a larger quantity.
Repairing and building tools
Figure 15-2 shows additional hand tools that you need when you begin doing
your own repair work or building equipment. (I don’t show the larger tools,
such as drills and bench vises.)
Repairing and building go beyond maintenance in that you work with metal
and plastic materials. You also need some additional specialty tools and
instruments for making adjustments and measurements:
 Wattmeter or SWR meter: When troubleshooting a transmitter, you
need an independent power measurement device. Many inexpensive
models work fairly well (stay away from those in the CB shops; they
272
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

often are not calibrated properly when used away from CB frequencies),
but the Bird Model 43 is the gold standard in ham radio. Different ele-
ments, or slugs, are used at different power levels and frequencies. You
can find both used meters and elements.
 RF and audio generators and oscilloscope: While you can do a lot with
DC tests and a voltmeter, radio is mostly about AC signals. To work with
AC signals, you need a means to generate and view them. If you’re seri-
ous about getting started in electronics, go to the ARRL Web site (www.
arrl.org/tis/info/HTML/Hands-On-Radio/) to find out how to pur-
chase ’scopes and generators.
 Nibbling tool and chassis punch: Starting with a round hole, the nibbler
is a hand-operated punch that bites out a small rectangle of sheet metal
or plastic. Use a nibbler to make a large rectangular or irregular opening
and then file the hole to shape. The chassis punch makes a clean hole in
up to 1⁄8-inch aluminum or 20-gauge steel. These are not cheap, but if you
plan on building regularly, the time savings and quality improvements
are enormous.
 T-handled reamer and countersink: The reamer allows you to enlarge a
small hole to a precise fit. A countersink quickly smoothes a drilled
hole’s edges and removes burrs.

Chapter 15: Hands-On Radio

Drilling a hole in a panel or chassis that already has wiring or electronics
mounted on or near it takes special measures. You must prevent metal chips
from falling into the equipment and keep the drill from penetrating too far. To
control chips, put a few layers of masking tape on the side of the panel where
you are drilling with the outer layers kept loose to act as a safety net. To keep
a drill bit from punching down into the wiring, use a small piece of hollow
tubing that exposes just enough bit to penetrate all the way through.
Components for repairs and building
I find myself using the same components in the following list for most building
and repair projects. Stock up on these and you’ll always have what you need:
 Resistors: Various values of 5-percent metal- or carbon-film, 1⁄4- and 
1⁄2-watt fixed-value resistors; 100, 500, 1k, 5k, 10k, and 100k ohm variable
resistors and controls
 Capacitors: 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 µF ceramic; 1, 10, and 100 µF tantalum or
electrolytic; 1000 and 10000 µF electrolytic; miscellaneous values
between 220 and 10000 pF film or ceramic

Although having a completely stocked shop is nice, you’ll find that building
up the kinds of components you need takes time. Rather than give you a huge
shopping list, here are some guidelines to follow:
 When you buy or order components for a project, order extras. The
smaller components, such as resistors, capacitors, transistors, and
diodes, are often cheaper if you buy in quantities of ten or more. After a
few projects, you have a nice collection.
 Hamfests are excellent sources of parts and component bargains.
Switches and other complex parts are particularly good deals. Parts draw-
ers and cabinets often come with parts in them and you can use both!
 Broken appliances and entertainment devices around the home are
worth stripping before throwing out. Power cords and transformers,
headphone and speaker jacks, switches, and lots and lots of interesting
hardware otherwise end up in the dump. Plus, seeing how they’re made
is interesting.

Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

 Build up a hardware junk box by tossing in any loose screws, nuts,
spacers, springs, and so on. Use an old paint tray or a flat, open tray to
make rooting through the heap easy in search of a certain part. The junk
box can be a real timesaver.
Maintaining Your Station
The best thing you can do for your station is to spend a little time doing regu-
lar maintenance. It works for cars, checkbooks, and relationships, so why not
ham radio?
Be sure to keep a station notebook (see Chapter 13). The station notebook is
a cheap and effective substitute for the frailties of human memory. Open the
notebook whenever you add a piece of equipment, wire a gadget, note a prob-
lem, or fix a problem. Over time, the notebook helps you avoid or solve prob-
lems, but only if you keep it up to date.
You also need to set aside a little time on a regular basis to inspect, test, and
check the individual components that make up the station. Along with the
equipment, this includes the cables, power supplies, wires, ropes, masts, and
everything else between the operator and the ionosphere. Check them when
you plan to be off the air so that you don’t have to do a panic fix when you
want to be on the air. All the equipment and antennas in the world are of no
use if they’re not working.
You can make routine maintenance easy with a checklist. Start with the fol-
lowing list and customize it for your station:
 Check all RF cables, connectors, switches, and grounds: Make sure all
connectors are tight because thermal cycling can work them loose.
Rotate switches or cycle relays to keep contacts clean and turn up prob-
lems. Look for kinks in or damage to feedlines. Be sure that ground con-
nections are snug.
 Test transmitters and amplifiers for full power output on all bands:
Also double-check your antennas and RF cabling. Use full power output
to check all bands for RF feedback or pickup on microphones, keying
lines, or control signals.
 Check received noise level (too high or too low) on all bands: The
noise level is a good indication of whether feedlines are in good shape, if
preamps are working, or if you have a new noise source to worry about.
 Check SWR on all antennas: Be especially vigilant for changes in the fre-
quency of minimum SWR, which can indicate connection problems or
water getting into the antenna. Sudden changes in SWR (up or down)
275
Chapter 15: Hands-On Radio

mean tuning or feedline problems. SWR is discussed in Chapter 12 and
in the technical content on the Ham Radio For Dummies Web site.
 Inspect all antennas and outside feedlines: Use a pair of binoculars or
climb up and check. You’re looking for loose connections; unraveling
tape, ties, or twists; damage to cable jackets; and that sort of thing.
 Inspect ropes and guys: Get in the habit of checking for tightness and
wear whenever you walk by. A branch rubbing on a rope can eventually
cause a break. Knots can come loose.
 Inspect masts, towers, and antenna mounts: The time to find problems
is well before the weather turns bad. Use a wrench to check tower and
clamp bolts and nuts. Fight rust with a cold galvanizing paint. After the
winter, check again for weather damage.
 Vacuum and clean the operating table and equipment; clear away
loose papers and magazines. Sneak those coffee cups back to the
kitchen and recycle the old soft drink cans. Make sure all fans and venti-
lation holes are clean and not blocked.
I realize that you may not want to haul the vacuum cleaner into the radio
shack, but it may be the most valuable piece of maintenance gear you have.
Heat is the mortal enemy of electronic components and leads to more failures
than any other cause. The dust and crud that settles on radio equipment
restricts air flow and acts as an insulator against heat dissipation. High voltage
circuits, such as in an amplifier or computer monitor, attract dust like crazy.
Vacuuming removes the dust, wire bits, paper scraps, and other junk so they
can’t cause expensive trouble.
As you complete your maintenance, note whether anything needs fixing or
replacing and why, if you know. You will probably get some ideas about
improvements or additions to the station, so note those, too.
Over time you will notice that some things regularly need work. In my station,
because I have moveable desks, the ground connections need constant atten-
tion. After I noted regular trouble with a solid strap, I replaced it with a piece
of braid and haven’t had any more trouble. Regular maintenance uncovered
the problem and I fixed it before I had an interference or feedback problem.
If you do routine maintenance three or four times a year, you can dramati-
cally reduce the number of unpleasant surprises you receive.
Overall Troubleshooting Tips
No matter how well you do maintenance, something eventually breaks or
fails. Finding the problem quickly is the hallmark of a master, but you can
become a good troubleshooter by remembering a few simple rules:
276
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

 Try not to jump to conclusions. Work through the problem in an orderly
fashion. Write your thoughts down to help focus.
 Start at the big picture and work your way down to the equipment
level.
 Avoid making assumptions. Check out everything possible for yourself.
 Read the equipment manual. The manufacturer knows the equipment
best.
 Consult your station notebook. Look for recent changes or prior
instances of related behavior.
 Write down any changes or adjustments while troubleshooting so you
can reverse them later. You may not remember everything that you did.
Troubleshooting Your Station
Your station is a collection of equipment (including antennas) connected
together. To operate properly, each piece of equipment expects certain condi-
tions to be met at each of its connectors and controls. You can trace many
station problems to violations of those conditions, often without using any
test equipment more sophisticated than a voltmeter. The problem usually is
either the equipment or the connection.
Most station problems fall into two categories: RF and operational. RF prob-
lems are things such as high SWR, no signals, and reports of poor signal
quality. Operational problems include not turning on (or off) properly, not
keying (or keying inappropriately), or no communications between pieces of
equipment.
Start by assigning the problem to one of these categories. (You may be wrong,
but you have to start somewhere.)
RF problems
Some RF problems occur when RF is not going to where it’s supposed to go.
These problems are generally a bad or missing cable, connector, or switching
device (a switch or relay) that needs to be replaced. Try fixing these problems
with the following suggestions:
 Replace cables and adapters if you have spares you know work.
 Note which combinations of switching devices and antennas seem to
work and which don’t. See if the problem is common to a set or piece of
equipment or specific cables.
277
Chapter 15: Hands-On Radio

 Temporarily jumper around or bypass switches, relays, or filters. If the
jumper is not obvious, leave a note so you don’t forget about it.
 Check through antenna feedlines. Take into account whether the
antenna feedpoint has a DC connection across it, such as a tuning network
or impedance matching transformer. Gamma-matched Yagi beams show
an open circuit while beta-matched Yagis and quad loops have a few ohms
of resistance across the feedpoint. (Note: Recording the normal value of
such resistances in the station notebook for comparison when trouble-
shooting is a good idea.)
 Troubleshoot test equipment using the receiver’s noise. Disconnecting
and reconnecting antenna cables causes changes in the noise level.
Other problems you may come across include hot microphones and equip-
ment enclosures, or interference to computers or accessories. (You haven’t
fully lived until you get a little RF burn on your lip from a metal microphone
case!) Usually you can fix these problems with a little grounding. Try these
suggestions:
 Double-check to ensure the equipment is grounded to the station RF
ground bus. The equipment may be grounded, but double-checking
never hurts.
 Check the shield connections on audio or control cables. These cables
are often fragile and might break when flexed or yanked. (You never yank
cables, do you?)
 Try different grounding connections or coil up an excessively long
cable.
 Add ferrite RF suppression cores or beads to the cables to equipment
you can’t ground. For more on this, skip ahead to the “Ferrites as RFI
suppressors” sidebar.
On the higher HF bands, particularly 21, 24, and 28 MHz, connections begin to
look like antennas as their lengths exceed 1⁄8 of a wavelength. For example, a
6-foot serial cable is about 3⁄16 wavelengths long on 28 MHz and has a sizeable
RF voltage at the midpoint, even though both ends are grounded! If you have
RF pickup problems on just one band, try attaching a 1⁄4 wavelength counter-
poise wire to move the RF hot spot away from the equipment in question. A
quarter-wave conductor open-circuited at one end can look short-circuited at
the other. Like balancing a tire with weights, attaching the counterpoise to
the enclosure of the affected equipment may lower the RF voltage enough to
reduce or eliminate the interference. Keep the wire insulated and away from
people and equipment at the open end.
278
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

Operational problems
Operational problems fall into three categories: power, data, and control.
After you determine which type of problem you have, you often come very
close to the cause of the problem.
Power problems
Power problems can be obvious (no power), spectacular (high voltage power
supply failure), or subtle (AC ripple, slightly low or high voltage, or poor con-
nections). The key is to never take power for granted. Just because the power
supply light is on doesn’t mean the output is at the right voltage. I have wasted
a lot of time due to not checking power and now I always check the power
supply voltages first. Try these solutions to fix your power problems:
 Check to see if the problem is caused by the equipment, not the power
supply. You can easily isolate obvious and spectacular failures, but don’t
just swap in another supply until you’re sure that the problem is in fact
the power supply. Connecting a power supply to a shorted cable or input
can quickly destroy the supply’s output circuits. If a circuit-breaker or
fuse keeps opening, don’t jumper it. Find the reason it’s doing so.
 Check for low output voltage. Low voltage can cause all sorts of strange
behavior by radios. The microprocessor may not function correctly, lead-
ing to bizarre displays, loss of external control, and incorrect response to
controls. Low voltage can also result in low power output or poor RF sta-
bility (chirpy, drifting, or raspy signals).
 Check the supply with both AC and DC meter ranges. Hum on your
signal can mean a failing power supply or battery. A DC voltmeter check
may be just fine, but less than 100 mV of AC needs to be on the power
supply output.
 If you suspect a poor connection, measure voltage at the load (for
example, the radio) and work your way back to the supply. Poor con-
nections in a cable or connector cause the voltage to drop under load.
They can be difficult to isolate because they’re only a problem with high
current, such as when transmitting. Voltage may be fine when you
receive. Excessive indicator light dimming is a sure indicator of poor
connections or a failing power supply.
Working on AC line-powered and 50-volt or higher supplies can be dangerous.
Follow safety rules and get help if you need it.

Chapter 15: Hands-On Radio

Data problems
Data problems are more and more common around modern radio shacks.
Interfaces between computers, radios, and data controllers are usually made
with RS-232 connections. If you installed new equipment and can’t get it to
play with your other equipment, three common culprits are to blame:
 Baud rate: An improper baud rate (or the data framing parameters of
start bits, stop bits, and parity) renders links inoperative, even if the
wiring is correct. Baud rate specifies how fast data is sent. The framing
parameters specify the format for each byte of data. These may be set as
part of a software interface or by switches in an accessory.
 Protocol errors: Protocol errors are generally a mismatch in equipment
type or version. A PC using the Kenwood radio control protocol can’t
control a Yaesu or Ten-Tec radio, for example. Be sure all the equipment
involved can actually use the same protocol or is specified for use with
the exact models you have.
 Improper wiring configuration: Read the operating manuals for both
pieces of equipment and be sure that you connect any required control
signals properly. The cables may require jumpering pins at either or
both ends. A common cable configuration, called a null modem, con-
nects all RS-232 output signals to their companion input. You can make
or buy null-modem cables or use a straight-through cable (pin 1 con-
nected to pin 1, pin 2 to pin 2, and so on) and use a null-modem adapter
at one end of the link.
RS-232 connections come in three common configurations. Three-wire config-
urations have Receive Data (RxD), Transmit Data (TxD), and ground — the
software takes care of controlling the data flow. Five-wire configurations
require RxD, TxD, ground, and Request to Send (RTS) and Clear to Send (CTS)
control lines. The control lines implement hardware handshaking to control
the data flow. If its control lines aren’t configured properly, an output port
won’t send data. Seven-wire configurations add Data Terminal Ready (DTR)
and Data Set Ready (DSR). You may also encounter Carrier Detect (CD) in
packet data systems, indicating whether the channel is busy.
If you suddenly experience a failure in equipment that was communicating
properly before, you may have a loose cable or the configuration of the soft-
ware on one end of the link may have changed. Double-check the communica-
tions settings and swap cables.
You have a lot of options in wiring up an RS-232 link. Luckily, radio and acces-
sory manufacturers generally don’t get too fancy with the cabling, but you do
need to read the manuals. If you’d like to know more about RS-232 interfaces,
the tutorial at www.data-com-experts.com/RS232_Data_Interface_
tutorial.html has a lot of useful information and connector wiring diagrams.
280
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

A breakout box, shown in Figure 15-3, is an invaluable tool for troubleshooting
serial data connections. It allows you to monitor the status of all data and
control lines. You can disconnect lines and jumper pins, as well. With a break-
out box, determining if you have transmit and receive lines swapped or a con-
trol signal misrouted is easy. Less capable, but handy, are RS-232 status
testers that show the state of each of several commonly used lines. Both are
available from Jameco Electronics (www.jameco.com) and similar vendors.
New computers, as of early 2004, often have only USB or FireWire serial data
ports. But the serial data interface standard in the radio shack is RS-232. You
have two solutions: Install a multi-port RS-232 interface board in the com-
puter or use USB-to-RS-232 adapters. Both require you to install drivers in
your operating system. The interface boards tend to be the most compatible
with radio gear. USB adapters convert the data twice (once between RS-232
and USB and then once between USB and the computer host), which leads to
more opportunity for incompatibility. If you go the USB route, I suggest
checking with the radio or accessory vendor for recommended adapters.

Chapter 15: Hands-On Radio

Control problems
Control problems are caused by either the infamous pilot error (in other
words, you) or actual control input errors.
Pilot error is the easiest, but most embarrassing, to fix. With all the buttons
and switches in the shack, I’m amazed I don’t have more problems. Follow
these steps to fix your error:
1. Check that all of the operating controls are set properly.
Bumping or mistakenly moving a control is easy. Refer to the operator’s
manual for a list of settings for the various modes. Try doing a control-
by-control setup and don’t forget controls on the back panel or under an
access panel.
Speaking from hard personal experience, before you decide that a radio
needs to go to the shop, check every control on the front panel, especially
squelch (which can mute the audio unexpectedly), MOX (which turns 
the transmitter on all the time), and Receive Antenna (which makes the
receiver sound dead if no receive antenna is attached). If you are really
desperate, most radios have the capability of performing a hard reset,
which restores all factory default settings but also wipes out the memory
settings.
2. Disconnect every cable from the radio one at a time, except for power
and the antenna.
Start with the cable that contains signals related to the problem. If the
behavior changes for any of the cables, dig into the manual to find out
what that cable does. Could any of the signals in that cable cause the
problem? Check the cable with an ohmmeter, especially for intermittent
shorts or connections, by wiggling the connector while watching
the meter.
3. If the equipment is not responding to a control input, such as keying
or PTT, then you need to simulate the control signal.
Most control signals are switch or contact closures between a connector
pin and either ground or 12V. You can easily simulate a switch closure
with . . . a switch! Replace the control cable with a spare, but unwired
connector and use a test lead (wires with small clips on each end) to
jumper the pin to the proper voltage. You may want to solder a small
switch to the connector with short wires if the pins are close together.
Manually make the connection and see if the equipment responds prop-
erly. If so, something is wrong in the cable or device generating the
signal. If not, the problem is in the equipment you are testing.
At this point, you’ll probably have isolated the problem to a specific piece
of equipment, where your electronic skills can take over. You now have a deci-
sion to make. If you are experienced in electronics and have the necessary
282
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 

information about the equipment (schematic and operating manual), then by
all means go ahead with your repairs. Otherwise, proceed with caution!
Troubleshooting Your Home
and Neighborhood
If you have problems outside of your shack, they usually consist of the dreaded
RF Interference (RFI), as in “I can hear you on my telephone!” or “My garage
door is going up and down!” Lesser known, but just as irritating, is the man-
bites-dog situation — your station receives interference from some other elec-
tric or electronic device. Solving these problems can lead you through some
real Sherlock Holmes-ian detective work.
Start by browsing the ARRL RFI Information page located at www2.arrl.org/
tis/info/rfigen.html. For in-depth information, including diagrams and
how-to instructions, read a copy of The ARRL RFI Book, which covers every
common interference problem. Your club library may have a copy. Consult
your club experts for assistance. Occasional interference problems are a fact
of life in this modern era and you’re not the only one to experience them.
Use the experience and resources of others to help you out!
Dealing with interference 
to other equipment 
Start by making your own home interference free. Unless you are a low-power
VHF/UHF operator, you likely own at least one appliance that reacts to your
transmissions by buzzing, humming, clicking, or doing its best duck imitation
along with your speech. It’s acting like a very unselective AM receiver and
your strong signal is being converted to audio, just like the old crystal radio
sets did. It’s not the ham radio’s fault — the appliance is failing to reject your
signal — but it’s still annoying.
Your goal is to keep your signal out of the appliance so that it doesn’t receive
the signal. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Start by removing all accessory cords
and wires to see if the problem goes away. If it does, put the cords and wires
back one at a time to see which one is acting as the antenna. Power cords
and speaker leads are very good antennas and often conduct the RF into the
appliance. Wind candidate cables onto a ferrite interference suppression core
(RadioShack 273-104 and 273-105) close to the appliance and see if that cures
the problem. You may have to core all the leads, although generally just one or
two are sensitive. RadioShack also sells AC power cord filters (part number
15-1111) that may help.
283
Chapter 15: Hands-On Radio

If the device is battery-powered and doesn’t have any leads, you probably
can’t fix the problem, I’m sorry to say. You have to either replace the device
or get along with the interference. The manufacturer’s Web site may have
some interference cures, or you may find some guidance from the ham radio
Web sites or club members. Try entering the model number of the appliance
and interference into a search engine to see what turns up.
The following common devices are often victims of interference:
 Cordless telephones: Those that use 47 MHz frequencies are often dev-
astatingly sensitive to strong out-of-band signals. Luckily, these phones
are being replaced with models that use 900 MHz and 2.4 GHz radio links.
These newer models are much less sensitive to your RF. If you come up
against one of the 47 MHz units, just replace it with a newer one.
 Touch lamps: These accursed devices respond to nearly any strong
signal on any frequency. You can try ferrite cores on the power cord, but
results are definitely mixed. Internal modifications are described on the
ARRL RFI Web site. Replacing the lamp may be the easiest option.
 TVs and VCRs: The usual point of entry for unwanted RF is through the
VHF/UHF cable input. The sensitive tuners are easily overloaded. If the
interference is from an HF signal, a high-pass filter often does the job.
RadioShack 15-579 is an inexpensive filter that I use successfully. Cable
installations may have loose connections that allow ham signals to leak
in. The usual symptom is interference with cable channel 18 when trans-
mitting on the 2-meter band. Have the cable company check and tighten
the connections.
284
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 
Part 15 devices
Unlicensed devices that use RF signals to oper-
ate or communicate are subject to the FCC’s
Part 15 rules. These rules include cordless
phones, wireless modems or headsets, garage
door openers, and other such devices. Devices
that may radiate RF signals unintentionally, such
as computers and video games, are also sub-
ject to Part 15 rules. The rules make a tradeoff:
The device owners don’t need a license to oper-
ate the cordless phone, but are required not to
interfere with and to accept any interference
from a properly operating licensed service,
such as Amateur Radio. This agreement gener-
ally works pretty well, except in the strong-
transmitter/sensitive-receiver environment of a
ham radio station. See the extensive discussion
of Part 15 rules on the ARRL RFI Web site
(www2.arrl.org/tis/info/rfigen.html)
for more details.

 Alarm systems: The many feet of wire strung around the house to the
various sensors and switches make a dandy antenna. Unfortunately, the
system controller sometimes confuses the RF they pick up for a sensor
trip. System installers have factory-recommended interference suppres-
sion kits that take care of most problems.
By practicing on your own home electronics, you gain valuable experience in
diagnosing and fixing interference problems. Also, if a neighbor has problems,
you’re prepared to deal with the issue. See the sidebar “Part 15 devices,” in
this chapter.
Dealing with interference 
to your equipment
You find two types of likely interference to you: electric and electronic.
Electric noise is caused primarily by arcing in power lines or equipment,
such as motors, heaters, and electric fences. Electronic noise is caused
by leaking RF signals from consumer appliances and computers operating
nearby or from nearby transmitters. Each has a distinctive signature or char-
acteristic sound. The following list describes the signatures of common
sources of electric noise:
 Power line: Steady or intermittent buzzing at 60 or 120 Hz; weather may
affect interference.
Power line noise is caused by arcing or corona discharge. Arcing can
occur around or even inside cracked or dirty insulators. It can also
occur when two wires rub together, such as a neutral and ground wire.
Corona discharge occurs at high-voltage points on sharp objects where
the air molecules become ionized and electricity leaks into the atmos-
phere. The interference is a buzzing noise because the arc or discharge
occurs at the peaks of the 60 Hz waveform, which occur at 120 Hz.
Do not attempt to fix problems with power lines. Always call your power
company.
You can assist the power company by locating the faulty equipment. You
can track down the noise source with a battery-powered AM radio or
VHF/UHF hand-held radio with an AM mode (aircraft band works well). If
you have a rotatable antenna at home, use it to pinpoint the direction of
the noise. (The null off the side of a beam antenna is sharper than the
peak of the pattern.) Walk or drive along the power lines in that direc-
tion to see if you can find a location where the noise peaks. I have found
several power poles with bad hardware by driving around with the car’s
285
Chapter 15: Hands-On Radio

AM radio tuned between stations. If you do find a suspect pole, write
down any identifying numbers on the pole. Several numbers for the dif-
ferent companies that use the pole may be on it; write them all down.
Contact your utility and ask to report interference. You can find a great
deal more information about this process on the ARRL RFI Web page.
 Industrial equipment: Sounds like power line noise, but with a more reg-
ular pattern, such as the case with motors or heaters that operate on a
cycle. Examples in the home include vacuum cleaners, furnace fans, and
sewing machines.
 Defective contacts: Failing thermostats or switches carrying heavy loads
emit highly erratic buzzing and rasping noise. These problems are signifi-
cant fire hazards in the home and you need to fix them immediately.
 Dimmers and speed controls: Low-level noise like power lines that comes
and goes as you use lights or motors.
 Automotive ignition noise: Buzzing that varies with engine speed, which
is caused by arcing in the ignition system.
 Electric fences: Regular pop-pop-pop noises at about one second inter-
vals. A defective charger can cause these problems, but the noise is usu-
ally due to broken or missing insulators or arcing from the fence wires to
weeds, brush, or ground.
286
Part IV: Building and Operating a Station That Works 
Ferrites as RFI suppressors
Ferrite is a magnetic ceramic material that is
used as a core in RF inductors and transform-
ers. It’s formed into rods, toroid cores (circular
and rectangular rings), and beads (small toroids
made to slip over wires). Ferrite has good mag-
netic characteristics at RF and is made in dif-
ferent formulations, called mixes, that optimize
it for different frequency ranges. For example,
Amidon ferrites made of Type 73 material work
best at HF and Type 43 ferrites work best at VHF.
Preventing RFI (RF interference) often means
preventing unwanted RF current flow. Inductors
have an increasing reactance (resistance to AC
current) with frequency, so placing an inductor
at the right spot can do the job. Forming the wire
or cable into a coil does make an inductor, but
getting enough inductance can mean making
a sizeable coil, particularly below 10 MHz.
Winding the wire on a ferrite core or using a fer-
rite bead can create sufficient inductance in a
very small volume.
Because of their small size, you can place fer-
rite cores and beads very close to the point at
which an undesired signal is getting into or out
of a piece of equipment. Beads are designed to
slip over wires and cables. To create more
inductance, use more beads. You can secure
them on the cable with a plastic cable-tie, tape,
or heat-shrink tubing. Cores are wound with
several turns of the wire or cable. This tech-
nique works particularly well with telephone
and power cords. Split cores come with a plas-
tic cover that holds the core together, which
makes placing the core on a cable or winding
turns easy if the cable already has a large con-
nector installed.

Finding an in-home source of electric noise depends on whether the device
is in your home or a neighbor’s. Tracking down in-home sources can be as
simple as recognizing the pattern when the noise is present and correlating it
to an appliance. You can also turn off your home’s circuit breakers one at a
time to find the circuit powering the device. Then check each device on that
circuit.
If the noise is coming from outside your home, you have to identify the direc-
tion and then start walking or driving with a portable receiver. Review the
ARRL RFI Web site or reference texts for information about how to proceed
when the interfering device is on someone else’s property.
What about electronic noise? No problem! The following list describes the
signatures of common sources of electronic noise:
 Computers or microprocessor-controlled games, entertainment sys-
tems, and appliances: These produce steady or warbling tones on a
single frequency, strongest on HF, but you can also hear them through
VHF and UHF.
 Cable and power-line modems: You hear steady or warbling tones or
hissing/rasping on the HF bands.
 Cable TV leakage: Heard at VHF and UHF, buzzing (video signal) or
audio FM signal with program content. That TV may also experience
interference from you on that cable channel.
 Broadcast interference: A steady AM signal with programming or bursts
of speech or data interference is caused by overload of your receiver or
by spurious signals generated from strong signals mixing together, and
occasionally a spurious output from the broadcast transmitter itself.
Each type of electronic interference has its own set of techniques for finding
the source and stopping the unwanted transmission. You are most likely to
receive interference from devices in your own home or close by, because the
signals are weak. If you are sure that the source is not on your property, you
need a portable receiver that can hear the interfering signal.
The ARRL RFI Web site has some helpful hints on each type of interference as
well as guidance on how to diplomatically approach the problem (because
it’s not your device). The ARRL RFI Web site’s Overview page contains excel-
lent material on helping you deal with and manage interference complaints
(both by you and from others). ARRL members have the resources of the
League’s Technical Coordinators and technical information services, as well.
You can completely eliminate or reduce most types of interference to insignif-
icant levels with careful investigative work and application of the proper
interference suppression techniques. The important thing is to keep frustra-
tion in check and work the problem through.

Building Equipment from a Kit
Building your own gear — even just a simple speaker switch — is a great ham
tradition. By putting equipment together yourself, you become familiar with
the operation, repair, and maintenance of your existing equipment.
If you’re just getting started in electronics, I recommend that you start your
building adventures with kits. When I got started, you could find Heathkit in
every ham shack. Today, kits are available from many sources, such as
Ramsey, Ten-Tec, Vectronics, RadioShack, and others. You can find numerous
kit vendors on the ARRL Technical Information Service Web page (www.arrl.
org/tis/) by clicking the TISfind link and entering Kit in the Search box.
Choose the simpler kits until you are confident of your technique. Kits are a
great budget-saving way to add test instruments to your workbench and vari-
ous gadgets to your radio station. Not only that, but you don’t have to do the
metal work and the finished result looks great, too! After you build a few kits,
you’ll be ready to move on up to building a complete radio. Although the
Elecraft K2 (www.elecraft.com) is the top-of-the-line radio kit available
today, numerous smaller QRP radio kits are available from other vendors.
You can build most kits using just the maintenance tool kit. Concentrate on
advancing your soldering skills. Strive to make the completed kit look like a
master built it and take pride in the quality of your work. Read the manual
and use the schematic to understand how the kit works. Observe how the kit
is put together mechanically, particularly the front panel displays and
controls.
Building Equipment from Scratch
Building something by starting with a blank piece of paper or a magazine arti-
cle and then putting it to use in your own station is a real thrill. Building from
scratch is not too different from building a kit . . . except that you have to
make your own kit. Your first project should be a copy of a circuit in a maga-
zine or handbook — one that is known to work and gives directions on how
to assemble and test it. If a blank printed circuit board (or PCB) is available,
I recommend ordering one.
Imagine that you have to make a kit for someone else based on the instruc-
tions, schematic, and list of components. Photocopy the article and highlight
all of the instructions. If an assembly drawing is included, enlarge it for guid-
ance. Make extra copies so you can mark them up as you go. Read the article
carefully to identify any critical steps. When you get your components
together, sort them by type and value and place them in jars or an old muffin
288

pan. Keep a notebook handy so that you can take notes for later use. As you
build and test the unit and finally put it to use, everything is completely
documented.
If you choose to design a circuit from scratch, I salute you! Documenting your
work in a notebook is even more important to a project that starts with design.
Take care to make your schematics complete and well-labeled. Record what-
ever calculations you must make so that if you have to revisit some part of the
design later, you have a record of how you arrived at the original values. With
digital cameras in abundance, take a few photos along the way at important
milestones of construction. After you finish, record any tests that you make 
to verify that the equipment works.
Don’t let failure get you down! The first cut at designs hardly ever work out
exactly right and sometimes you even wind up letting all of the smoke out of
a component or two! If a design doesn’t work, figure out why and then move
on to the next version. Don’t be afraid to ask for help or try a different angle.
Ham radio isn’t a job, so keep things fun . . . after all, it’s amateur radio!

 Tips for improvement
 Ways for newbies to expand their proficiencies and build confidence
I
n this chapter, I present ten fundamental truths that can help even the
rankest beginner keep the wheels turning during those first forays into
ham radio. Keep these tips in mind and you’ll be on your way to veteran
status in no time.
Listening, Listening, Listening
Listening is the most powerful and important way to learn. Listen to the suc-
cessful stations to learn their techniques. Listening to on-the-air contacts is
called reading the mail. All ham communications are open and public — they
can’t be encrypted or obscured. Just turn on the radio and get a real-time
seminar in any facet of ham radio communication techniques you care to try.
Buddying Up
Find a friend who is learning the ropes like you are. Is there someone from
your licensing class or club also getting started? Meet on the air and get used
to using your equipment together. The best part is sharing in each other’s
successes!
Knowing Your Equipment
Hams joke about never reading the owner’s manual, but don’t believe it. Hams
need to know their equipment. If a demo or tutorial is available to you, go

through it. Practice adjusting the main controls or settings to observe the
effects. Acquire at least a passing familiarity with even the most obscure con-
trols. Keep the manual handy for quick reference, too.
Following the Manufacturer’s
Recommendations
The manufacturers want you to get the best performance and satisfaction out
of their equipment, don’t they? That’s why they have recommended settings
and procedures. Follow them until you are comfortable enough to optimize
performance on your own.
Trying Different Things
Don’t feel like you have to stay with one mode or band or magazine or radio.
Changing your mind and striking out in a different direction is okay. As you
become more comfortable with ham radio, feel free to dabble in anything that
catches your fancy. Sooner or later, you’ll discover something that makes you
want to dive in deeply.
Nobody Knows Everything
Surround yourself with handbooks and how-to articles, magazines, Web sites,
manuals, and catalogs. Use any reference available. If you’re confused or not
getting the results you expect, ask someone at a club meeting, on the air, or
in an Internet forum for help. The oldest tradition in ham radio is hams giving
other hams a hand. We’re amateurs! We like to do it! Someone helped us, and
we’ll help you.
Practicing Courtesy
Behind every receiver is a person just like you. Polite terms like “Please,”
“Thanks,” “Excuse me,” and “Sorry” work just as well on the air as they do in
person. Listen before transmitting and be flexible. If you encounter a rude
operator, just go somewhere else or find something else to do — don’t let
tempers escalate on the air.
294
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Joining In
By definition, ham radio isn’t a solitary activity. Ham radio is a lot more fun if
you have some regular acquaintances. Being welcomed on the air into a round-
table QSO or a local weather net is great. Ham radio welcomes kings and pau-
pers equally and we’re all on a first-name basis. The ham bands are your home.
Getting Right Back in the Saddle
So what if you called CQ and nobody responded? So what if you put up a new
antenna and it didn’t work? Get right back in the saddle and try again. I don’t
know of any ham who has instant success right off the bat, so don’t get dis-
couraged and give up. You worked too hard to get that license!
Relax, It’s a Hobby!
I know the scary feeling of thinking every ham is listening whenever you get
on the air. Hey, relax and don’t worry about a mistake putting you on a hobby-
wide blacklist. If you try something new and it doesn’t work out, that’s okay.
Everybody fumbles now and then. Keep ham radio fun for yourself and do
things you enjoy.

Ten Secrets of the Masters
In This Chapter
 Time-tested tips for newbies and masters alike
 Methods of honing your expertise
S
urely, the grizzled veterans have stores of secret knowledge that take
years and years to learn and make them the masters of all they survey?
Certainly they have their experiences and expertise, but down deep, you can
find they rely on simple principles that work in many different situations. You
can use them, too!
Listening, Listening, Listening
The masters get more out of listening than anyone because they have learned
how to listen. Every minute you spend listening is a minute learning and a
minute closer to being a master.
Learning What’s Under the Hood
Operating a radio and building an efficient and effective station are so much
easier if you know how the equipment works. Even if you’re not terribly tech-
savvy, take the time to learn the basics of electronics and how your equipment
functions. A master understands the effects of controls and adjustments.
Reading History
An appreciation of the rich history of ham radio helps you understand how
the hobby has shaped itself. Ham radio is full of conventions and methods
developed over time, many of which can seem at first confusing and obscure.
Master these conventions by understanding how they came about.

Having a Sharp Axe
When asked what he would do if given eight hours to cut down a tree, Abe
Lincoln replied that he would spend the first six hours sharpening his axe.
Masters keep their equipment and skills sharp. When they’re needed on the
air, they’re ready.
Practicing Makes Perfect
Even a sharp axe gets dull over time. A master is on the air regularly, keeping
in tune with conditions. A master knows who is active, from where, and when.
Make operating your radio station a natural and comfortable activity by keep-
ing yourself in shape with regular radio exercise.
Paying Attention to Detail
Masters know that the little things are what make the difference between 100-
percent and 90-percent performance or even between being on and off the air.
Waterproofing that connector completely or having your CQ sound just right
really pays off in the long run. And masters are on the radio for the long run.
The Problem Ain’t What You Don’t Know
It’s what you do know that ain’t so! (Will Rogers) If you guess wrong, don’t be
too proud to admit it. Learn the right way or correct fact. The worst mistakes
are made by ignoring the truth. A master isn’t afraid to say those three dreaded
words, “I don’t know!”
Antennas Make the Difference
If you look at the top stations in any facet of ham radio, you’ll find that their
owners spend the most time and effort on the antenna systems. You’ll find no
better return on investment in ham radio than in improving your antennas.
Masters are often antenna and feedline gurus.
298
Part V: The Part of Tens 

A Decibel Is a Decibel Is a Decibel
Masters know that any improvement in the path between operators is not to be
discounted. Anything that makes your signal easier to understand — one deci-
bel less noise received, one decibel better audio quality, one decibel stronger
transmitted signal — makes holding the contact easier.
Ham Radio Is a Lifetime of Learning
Take advantage of every learning opportunity, including learning from your
mistakes . . . you’ll have plenty! A master knows that each problem or goof is
also a lesson. Masters get to be masters by starting as raw recruits just like
you and then making one improvement at a time, day in and day out.

Ten First Station Tips
In This Chapter
 Avoiding mistakes in the creation of your first station
 Saving money on equipment
W
hen you’re putting your first station together — whether at home,
mobile, portable, or even just a hand-held radio — getting sidetracked
and creating problems later is easy. Avoid common pitfalls by applying the
simple tips I give in this chapter. That way, you won’t scratch your head later,
thinking, “Why did I do that?”
Being Flexible
Don’t assume that you’ll be doing the same activities on the air forever. Avoid
over-specialized gear except where required for a specific type of operating.
Make use of the flexibility of a computer and software to implement functions
that are likely to change, such as a digital signal. Don’t nail everything down:
Allow equipment to be moved around for comfort and layout convenience.
The built-in look is attractive, but very hard to change later.
Looking and Learning
Browse the Web and read articles that show how other stations are put
together. Make note of any particularly good ideas. Don’t hesitate to write or
e-mail the station owners to ask questions — they welcome your attention
and interest. Take advantage of opportunities to visit local stations, too.

Don’t Put All Your Eggs in One Basket
Spending a lot of money on a radio right away is tempting, but you’ll find your-
self needing other gear, such as antennas and cables, that you perhaps hadn’t
counted on. Those extras can add up to at least as much as your main radio, so
leave yourself some budget for them, too.
Used-Equipment Bargains
If you have a knowledgeable friend who can help you separate the wheat from
the chaff, used equipment is a great way to get started. By saving money, you
have more cash for exploring new modes and bands later on. It’s caveat emptor,
though: You can easily encounter junk equipment. If in doubt, or if the deal
seems too good to be true, pass it up.
Building Something!
Using equipment you build yourself is a thrill. Your skills benefit from small
construction projects such as audio switches, filters, or keyers. Buying every-
thing new is generally less trouble, but the equipment is expensive, too. Build-
ing some things yourself can save you some money. Don’t be afraid to get out
the drill and soldering iron. You can find lots of kits, magazines, and handbook
articles to get you started.
Being Well-Grounded
Don’t neglect grounding. Put in a ground system (see Chapter 13) as the first
step — adding grounding after the equipment and wires are already in place is
much harder. Good grounding helps you avoid RF feedback and ground loops
later, both frustrating and aggravating problems.
302
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Saving Money by Building 
Your Own Cables
You need lots of cables and connectors in your station. At a cost of roughly
$5 or more for each pre-made cable, you can quickly spend as much on con-
necting your equipment as you can on a major accessory. Learn how to install
connectors well and you save many, many dollars over the course of your
ham career.
Building Step-by-Step
After you have the basics of your shack in place, you can upgrade your equip-
ment in steps so that you can always hear a little farther than you can transmit.
Don’t be an alligator (all mouth, no ears)! Plan ahead with a goal in mind so that
your ham radio dollars and hours all work to further that goal.
Finding the Weakest Link
Every station has a weakest link. Always be on the lookout for a probable
point of failure or of loss of quality. On the airwaves, you’ll encounter stations
with muffled or distorted audio that have a multi-kilobuck radio but a cheap,
garage-sale microphone. Use quality gear and keep heavily-used equipment
well-maintained.
Being Comfortable
You’re going to spend a lot of hours in front of your radio so take care of the
operator, too. Start with a comfortable chair — excellent chairs are often avail-
able in used office furniture stores at far below new cost. Make sure you have
adequate lighting and that the operating desk is at a comfortable height. Those
dollars will pay dividends every time you sit down!

Ten Easy Ways to Have 
Fun on the Radio
In This Chapter
 Tips to help you break out of your routine
 Contests and events
S
o you’re sitting there saying, “There’s nothing to do!” Don’t worry!
Everybody gets in a bit of a rut now and then. In this chapter, I give you
ten great ideas to shake off the radio blues and spice up your operating.
Listening for People Having 
Fun and Joining In
Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Just turn on the radio and start tuning the bands.
Join a ragchew, check into a net, monitor a slow-scan transmission, listen for
someone calling “CQ Contest,” or find a pileup and dive in. On any given day,
literally hundreds of different activities are taking place and all you need to
do to participate is to just spin the tuning dial and pay attention.
Special Events and Contests 
Are Looking for You!
Every weekend, you can find little pockets of activity sprinkled around the HF
and VHF bands as contests and special event stations take to the airwaves.
Nearly every contest is open to the casual passer-by. The operators involved

welcome your call and help you exchange the necessary information. You can
contact special event stations and often have beautiful, interesting certificates
for contacts.
Making Up Your Own Contest
Get together with your friends or club and dream up a silly competition just
for fun. Buy an old bowling trophy and make up a challenge to go with it. See
who can contact the most states in a weekend. Play radio bingo. Tune up and
down the band with a friend and see who can make contacts with the lowest
power. Go nuts, it’s a hobby!
Sending a Radiogram, Ma’am
Who is on your “I should write” list? Maybe a relative or friend would enjoy get-
ting a short radiogram for a birthday or just to say hello. Look up the NTS local
nets in your neighborhood, fill out the radiogram form, and jump in. Warning:
It’s addictive!
Joining the Parade
Every town has public events such as parades, festivals, sports, and concerts
that make use of hams to assist them with communications and other elec-
tronics chores. You’ll feel great after giving these folks a hand and they will
have an appreciation of ham radio, too. Contact your ARRL Section Manager
for information about how to get in touch with organizers or ham public ser-
vice groups.
Going Somewhere Cool
For a real treat, try mobile or portable operation from some unusual place. On
HF, try operating from a rural county or county line on the County Hunters Net.
On VHF and UHF, with a short drive, you can be in a sought-after grid square.
The nearest hilltop or scenic overlook can generate hours of fun. Take a photo
and make up a neat QSL card to go with the contacts!
306
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Squirting a Bird
Making contacts through a satellite (squirting a bird) is a lot easier than you
think. Try the FM repeater or packet satellites for starters. Monitor the Inter-
national Space Station and Space Shuttle downlink frequencies. You’ll receive
an interesting certificate just for reporting that you heard either one. Watching
their reflections move across the sky at dusk or dawn will never be the same
after you make contact with them.
Learning a New Lingo
Brush up those high-school foreign language skills and make contact with a 
DX station. If you’re equipped for HF, you can talk to them directly. Chapter 9
explains how to make VHF/UHF contacts via repeaters using IrLP or one of the
other linking systems. Ham radio makes learning a new language easy. Just
learn a few new words at a time, and soon you have a whole new vocabulary
and a DX friend or two, to boot.
Shortwave Listening (SWL-ing)
What’s on the frequencies between the HF ham bands? Most radios now have
general-coverage receivers that tune all frequencies, so why not tune in the
German national broadcaster Deutsche Welle or HCJB from Quito, Ecuador?
Check the Web sites or get a copy of a shortwave listener’s guide to find
English language programs. And, of course, music is always available and
requires no translation to enjoy.
Visiting a New Group
Drop in on a new club or net any time. They’ll be pleased you are visiting and
you may stumble into a whole new outlook on the hobby. I particularly enjoy
finding a club program on a subject I’m not acquainted with and making a
friend or two. Be sure to invite them to your meetings, as well!

Ten Ways to Give Back 
to Ham Radio
In This Chapter
 Tips for contributing to the ham radio community
 Preparing for emergencies
 Becoming an Elmer
H
am radio provides you with so many wonderful things to do and learn,
yet it is a service. The expectation is that beyond using ham radio just
for personal enjoyment, you contribute a little back to the public for use of
the airwaves. I show you ten ways to make a contribution in this chapter.
Preparing Yourself for Emergencies
The best thing you can do for emergency preparedness is to be sure you and
your family are ready. In an emergency, take care of home and family first. Only
then should you think of ham radio. If you’re not ready at home, you can’t pro-
vide assistance to others.
Preparing Your Community 
for Emergencies
Find out what emergency groups are active in your community. The ARRL
Section Manager or District Emergency Coordinator is a good place to start
asking. If a group is active, join it. If no group exists, maybe you should con-
sider starting one.

Volunteering in Your Club
All clubs need individuals willing to put their shoulders to the wheel. Whether
you are limited to minor services or can volunteer for a leadership position,
your time and effort is welcomed. If you are a new member, you’ll find no
better way to become part of the family than to help out with a chore, no
matter how small.
Performing Public Service Assistance
Public service assistance is an easy and rewarding way to make a contribu-
tion. Start by asking the ARRL Section Manager if you can pitch in at a fun
run, parade, or sporting event. By lending a hand, you help everything run
more smoothly and learn a lot about emergency communications.
Experimenting
The Amateur Service is also intended to foster technical innovation in radio
technology and techniques. You don’t have to be a Nobel laureate to try out a
new antenna design, write a simple program, or experiment with propagation.
Also, telling others about your results is easier than you may think. Newsletters
and magazines love to help you spread the word.
Participating in On-the-Air Monitoring
The amateur bands are often hosts to unwanted intruders who take advan-
tage of the bands to avoid licensing fees or tests. The ARRL’s Intruder Watch
program needs your ears to help keep these freeloaders out. If you’d like to
assist ham radio’s self-policing nature, consider becoming an Official Observer.
NOAA’s SKYWARN program and numerous local weather nets depend on the
contributions of hams, as well.
310
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Acting as a Product Tester 
or QSL Manager
Hardware manufacturers and software authors often need testing assistance
from hams, the potential users of their products. Keep a watch for requests
for testers on Web sites and in Internet forums. Also, DX stations often need
help with replying to the many QSL requests they receive. Offering your ser-
vices as a manager furthers the sport of DX-ing and international goodwill.
Representing Amateur Radio
Write your government representatives on issues affecting ham radio. Don’t
limit yourself to state and federal issues. Many things happen on the local level,
such as zoning, planning, covenants, and permitting that could use your input.
Conversely, discovering planned actions that have an adverse affect on the ser-
vice can save us all a lot of trouble, if modified in time.
Being an Elmer
You’re a full-fledged ham now, so you can put on the Elmer hat and give a
hand to others just starting out. Being new to the hobby yourself, you are in 
a great position to understand what a newcomer needs to know and what
seems confusing.
Making Lifelong Friendships
I would be omitting one of the most important aspects of building and main-
taining a vital and dynamic service if I did not mention the friendships that
hams form. They knit the hobby together and make it an enjoyable activity to
return to over the course of a lifetime. By enjoying each other’s company and
sharing in successes and failures, we build a community that grows stronger
with every new voice.

Appendix A
Glossary
T
his glossary is reprinted with the permission of the ARRL.
Amateur operator: A person holding a written authorization to be the control
operator of an amateur station.
Amateur service: A radio communication service for the purpose of self-
training, intercommunication, and technical investigations carried out by
amateurs, that is, duly authorized persons interested in radio technique
solely with a personal aim and without pecuniary interest.
Amateur station: A station licensed in the amateur service, including neces-
sary equipment, used for amateur communication.
Ammeter: A test instrument that measures current.
Ampere (A): The basic unit of electrical current. Current is a measure of the
electron flow through a circuit. If you count electrons, 6.24 × 1018 electrons
moving past a point in one second equal a current of one ampere. Abbreviated
as amps. (Numbers written as a multiple of some power are expressed in
exponential notation, as shown here.)
Amplitude modulation (AM): A method of combining an information signal
and an RF (radio-frequency) carrier. In voice AM transmission, the voice infor-
mation can vary (modulate) the amplitude of an RF carrier. Shortwave broad-
cast stations use this type of AM, as do stations in the Standard Broadcast
Band (535 to 1710 kHz). A variation of AM, known as single sideband, is very
popular.
Antenna: A device that picks up or sends out radio frequency energy.
Antenna switch: A switch that connects one transmitter, receiver, or trans-
ceiver to several different antennas.
Antenna tuner: A device that matches the antenna system input impedance
to the transmitter, receiver, or transceiver output impedance. Also called an
antenna-matching network, impedance-matching network, or Transmatch.

Autopatch: A device that allows repeater users to make telephone calls through
a repeater.
Balun: Contraction for balanced to unbalanced. A device to couple a balanced
load to an unbalanced source, or vice versa.
Band spread: A receiver quality that describes how far apart stations on dif-
ferent nearby frequencies seem to be. Usually expressed as the number of
kilohertz that the frequency changes per tuning-knob rotation. The amount of
band spread determines how easily signals can be tuned.
Band-pass filter: A circuit that allows signals to go through it only if the sig-
nals are within a certain range of frequencies. It attenuates signals above and
below this range.
Bandwidth: The width of a frequency band outside of which the mean power is
attenuated at least 26dB below the mean power of the total emission, including
allowances for transmitter drift or Doppler shift. Bandwidth describes the
range of frequencies that a radio transmission occupies.
Battery: A device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy.
Beacon station: An amateur station transmitting communications for the 
purposes of observation of propagation and reception or other related exper-
imental activities.
Beam antenna: A directional antenna. A beam antenna must be rotated to
provide its strongest coverage in different directions.
Beat-frequency oscillator (BFO): A receiver circuit that provides a signal to
the detector. The BFO signal mixes with the incoming signal to produce an
audio tone for CW reception. A BFO is needed to copy CW and SSB signals.
Broadcasting: Transmissions intended to be received by the general public,
either direct or relayed.
Capacitor: An electrical component usually formed by separating two con-
ductive plates with an insulating material. A capacitor stores energy in an
electric field.
Chirp: A slight shift in transmitter frequency each time you key the transmitter.
Closed repeater: A repeater that restricts access to those who know a special
code.
Coaxial cable (Coax): Pronounced kó-aks. A type of feedline with one conduc-
tor inside the other.
316
Part VI: Appendixes 

Continuous wave (CW): Morse code telegraphy.
Control operator: An amateur operator designated by the licensee of a station
to be responsible for the transmissions of an amateur station.
Control point: The locations at which the control operator functions are 
performed.
Courtesy tone: A tone or beep transmitted by a repeater to indicate that the
next station can begin transmitting. The courtesy tone is designed to allow a
pause between transmissions on a repeater, so other stations can call. It also
indicates that the time-out timer has been reset.
CQ: The general call when requesting a conversation with anyone — “Calling
any station.”
Crystal oscillator: A device that uses a quartz crystal to keep the frequency
of a transmitter constant.
Crystal-controlled transmitter: A simple type of transmitter that consists of a
crystal oscillator followed by driver and power amplifier stages.
CTCSS (Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System): A sub-audible tone system
used on some repeaters. When added to a carrier, a CTCSS tone allows a
receiver to accept a signal. Also called PL.
Cubical quad antenna: An antenna built with its elements in the shape of four-
sided loops.
Current: A flow of electrons in an electrical circuit.
CW (Morse code): A communications mode transmitted by on/off keying of a
radio-frequency signal. Another name for international Morse code.
D region: The lowest region of the ionosphere. The D region contributes very
little to shortwave radio propagation. It acts mainly to absorb energy from radio
waves as they pass through it. This absorption has a significant effect on sig-
nals below about 7.5 MHz during daylight.
Data: Computer-based communications modes, such as packet radio, which
can be used to transmit and receive computer files, or digital information.
DE: The Morse code abbreviation for “from” or “this is.”
Delta loop antenna: A variation of the cubical quad with triangular elements.
Digipeater: A packet-radio station used to retransmit signals that are specifi-
cally addressed to be retransmitted by that station.
317
Appendix A: Glossary

Digital communications: Computer-based communications modes. These
modes can include data modes, such as packet radio, and text-only modes
like radioteletype (RTTY).
Dipole antenna: See 1⁄2-wave dipole. A dipole not 1⁄2 wavelength long is called
a “doublet.”
Director: An element in front of the driven element in a Yagi antenna and some
other directional antennas.
Driven element: The part of an antenna that connects directly to the feedline.
Dual-band antenna: An antenna designed for use on two different Amateur
Radio bands.
Dummy antenna: A station accessory that allows you to test or adjust trans-
mitting equipment without sending a signal out over the air. Also called dummy
load.
Dummy load: See Dummy antenna.
Duplexer: A device that allows a dual-band radio to use a single dual-band
antenna.
Duty cycle: A measure of the amount of time a transmitter is operating at full
output power during a single transmission. A lower duty cycle means less RF

and the Experimenter, by Dave Ingram K4TWJ
Here you find good starter projects in this book for useful gadgets in the ham
shack and workbench.
Antennas
Hams are more likely to build antennas than any other piece of ham radio
equipment. Thus, there is no shortage of ideas. These references contain
many classic and innovative designs.
336
Part VI: Appendixes 

The ARRL Antenna Book
Published by the ARRL, this book is another ham radio classic, now in its 20th

Antenna Zoning for the Radio Amateur, by Fred Hopengarten K1VR
Here’s a detailed guide to the process of working with local zoning regulations
to obtain permits for amateur antennas and towers.
VHF/UHF/microwave
Operation above 50 MHz is one of the fastest-growing areas of ham radio with
more and more excellent equipment and components becoming available
every month. The following references help you assemble a working station
and use it effectively.
VHF/UHF Handbook, edited by Dick Biddulph G8DPS
Published by the RSGB, the VHF/UHF Handbook is a comprehensive guide to
setting up a station to go beyond the FM repeaters.

Propagation
The science of propagation is truly fascinating and affects every ham. The
more you know about it, the more interesting it becomes and the more suc-
cess you’ll have on the air. These references were selected to introduce the
basics of radio propagation to the new ham.
The New Shortwave Propagation Handbook, by Jacobs, Cohen, and Rose
This handbook covers HF propagation from introductory levels to advanced
topics. George Jacobs W3ASK wrote the CQ Magazine Propagation column for
many years.
