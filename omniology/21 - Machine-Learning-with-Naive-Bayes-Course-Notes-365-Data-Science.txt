Abstract 
 
Naïve Bayes algorithms are supervised machine learning algorithms that are 
most often used in classification tasks. Python’s sklearn library offers a variety of 
Naïve Bayes algorithms depending on the input data – whether it is numerical or 
categorical, balanced or imbalanced, dense or sparse. Their implementation is 
based on the famous Bayes’ theorem, named after the English statistician Thomas 
Bayes, who has contributed significantly to the topic of probability theory.  
Naïve Bayes algorithms are known to be fast learners, solve with ease 
problems in real-time, as well as handle sparse data. That is why they are preferred 
when faced with tasks involving text analysis, such as spam filtering, categorizing 
articles, sentiment analysis, etc.  
These course notes give, in a very compact and comprehensive manner, the 
essentials for understanding Bayes’ theorem and the Naïve Bayes algorithm. They 
serve as a complement to the video lectures by describing in further detail the 
theoretical concepts introduced there. The course notes could also be used as a 
quick reference to formulae, definitions, and key points.

2. Bayes’ Thought Experiment 
In 1763, two years after the passing of the British statistician Thomas Bayes, 
his friend Richard Price sends a letter1 to the British physicist John Canton 
containing Bayes’ lecture notes on probability theory. In this letter, Price discusses 
the importance of his friend’s work. In Section II of the famous lecture notes, Bayes 
describes a thought experiment that we will recreate below in a simpler fashion. 
 
Consider a square table divided into smaller squares in a 9-by-9 grid (Figure 
1). The rules are as follows. Each cell in the grid can be occupied by a single ball. 
The balls cannot occupy two or more cells simultaneously, that is, once they fall onto 
the table, they should fully occupy one of the 81 cells.

Figure 1: A square table divided into 81 squares. Imagine a red ball is tossed 
and lands somewhere on that table. Based on the rules and the conditions for 
the blue ball given in the text, where would you put the red ball? 

365 DATA SCIENCE

The orientation of the table is shown in Figure 2. 
 
 
 
 
Imagine a red ball is tossed and it lands somewhere on the table. The goal of 
this exercise is to guess the position of that ball based on the position of another, 
blue ball, with respect to the red one. 
Example: 
Consider the positions of the red and the blue ball in Figure 1 (not known a 
priori). The information you would be given, based on this arrangement, is: 
“A blue ball is tossed, and it lands 2 squares north and 3 squares west of the red 
ball.” 
We are now prepared for the thought experiment. Five blue balls are tossed in a 
row and land in a cell on the table. The position of each one with respect to the 
red ball is recorded. Below, you will find those records. 
1. A blue ball is tossed, and it lands 2 squares north and 1 square west of the 
red ball. 
2. A second blue ball is tossed, and it lands 1 square north and 3 squares east 
of the red ball.

3. A third blue ball is tossed, and it lands 4 squares north and 3 squares west 
of the red ball. 
4. A fourth blue ball is tossed, and it lands 5 squares north and 2 squares east 
of the red ball. 
5. A fifth blue ball is tossed, and it lands 3 squares south and 5 squares east of 
the red ball. 
Which cell do you think the red ball has landed in? You can find a discussion of 
this problem in the Appendix section. 
 
3. Bayes’ Theorem 
3.1. The frequentist versus the Bayesian approaches 
There are two ways to approach the topic of probability. The first one is the 
so-called frequentist approach. It is based on the idea of repeating an experiment 
a certain number of times and, as a result, estimating the probability of obtaining a 
particular outcome. 
Example 1:  
A novice darts player attempts to hit a target (Figure 3) consisting of three 
layers, with the outermost giving the least number of points and the innermost giving 
the maximum number of points.  
 
 
 
Figure 3: The target in a game 
of darts. 

365 DATA SCIENCE

The darts player wonders what her chances of hitting the bull’s eye are. She 
can resolve this problem by throwing the darts at the target 10 times. Assume that 
the dart ends up hitting the center twice. The player, therefore, concludes that 2 
out of 10 times, or once every 5 throws, she will be awarded the maximum number 
of points. The larger the number of throws, the more data would be obtained, 
therefore the better the predictions would be. This example assumes, of course, 
that practice does not make the player better at throwing darts. 
Through the Bayesian approach, on the other hand, we estimate the 
probability a certain hypothesis is true given past data (evidence). The difference 
with the frequentist approach is that the event whose outcome we are trying to 
predict will occur just once. 
Example 2: 
Consider the scenario from Example 1. This time, however, the already 
experienced darts player is competing in a World Championship. The audience is 
wondering what her chances of winning the game are. Unfortunately, this is not an 
experiment that can be conducted repeatedly – such championships are held only 
once every couple of years, so sufficient data would be hard to gather. Moreover, 
the outcome depends not only on the practice and experience she has gained but 
also on the practice and experience of the rest of the competitors. 
The Bayesian approach is used to quantify the belief in an outcome that 
would occur only once. Relevant questions for Bayesian statistics could be:

• Will it rain tomorrow? 
• Have I been diagnosed correctly? 
• Who will win the presidential elections? 
 
3.2. Marginal, joint, and conditional probabilities 
Before we derive Bayes’ theorem, we must introduce the relevant 
terminology. Consider two sets of events, 𝐴𝐴, and 𝐵𝐵. 
 
 
 
 
We define the following probabilities. 
• Marginal probability – the probability of an event from either set 
occurring. It is denoted as follows 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴) 
Example:  
Set 𝐴𝐴 represents the event of drawing a Queen from a deck of cards. 
The event of drawing the Queen of Spades, or the Queen of Clubs, or any 
other Queen from the deck, belongs to set A. Set 𝐵𝐵 represents the event of 
drawing a Spade. The event of drawing the Queen of Spades, or the King of 
Spades, or any other Spade from the deck, belongs to set 𝐵𝐵.

Since there are 4 Queens and 13 Spades in a deck of 52 cards, we can write 
down the marginal probabilities 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴) = 4
52 
𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵) = 13
52 
• Joint probability – the probability of an event from set 𝐴𝐴 and an event from 
set 𝐵𝐵 occurring simultaneously. It is represented by the intersection of the 
two sets and is denoted as follows 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵) 
Note that 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵) = 𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵∩𝐴𝐴) 
Example:  
The intersection of events 𝐴𝐴 and 𝐵𝐵 would be the event of drawing the 
Queen of Spades from a deck of cards. 
 
 
 
 
Since there is 1 Queen of Spades in a deck of 52 cards, we can write down 
the joint probability 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵) = 1
52

• Conditional probability – the probability of an event occurring given that 
another event has taken place. It is denoted as follows 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴|𝐵𝐵) 
The vertical bar in the parentheses is read as “given”. 
Note that 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴|𝐵𝐵) ≠𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵|𝐴𝐴) 
 
for dependent events. 
Example:  
“𝐴𝐴 given 𝐵𝐵” would be the event of drawing a Queen given that the set 
of cards to choose from are all Spades. There is only one Queen in a set of 13 
Spades. Therefore 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴|𝐵𝐵) = 1
13 
 “𝐵𝐵 given 𝐴𝐴” would be the event of drawing a Spade given that the set 
of cards to choose from are all Queens. There is only one Spade in a set of 4 
Queens. Therefore 
𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵|𝐴𝐴) = 1
4 
 
3.3. The product rule 
To derive the product rule, let’s first make the following comment. Marginal 
probabilities are estimated by taking the ratio between the favorable outcomes and 
all outcomes: 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴) = favorable outcomes
all outcomes
 

365 DATA SCIENCE 
 
12
 
In a very similar fashion, we can define conditional probabilities. In such a 
case, the favorable outcomes are those entering the intersection between the two 
sets 𝐴𝐴 and 𝐵𝐵. The probability of obtaining a favorable outcome is 𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵). All 
outcomes, on the other hand, are those for which event B takes place, no matter 
whether event 𝐴𝐴 occurred or not. This probability is 𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵). Therefore, 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴|𝐵𝐵) = 𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵)
𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵)
 
Analogously,  
𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵|𝐴𝐴) = 𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵)
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴)
 
Rearranging these equations, we obtain the product rule 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵) = 𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴|𝐵𝐵)𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵) 
and analogously 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴∩𝐵𝐵) = 𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵|𝐴𝐴)𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴) 
This result lies at the heart of proving Bayes’ theorem. 
 
3.4. Proof of Bayes’ theorem 
The result from the previous subsection showed that the intersection of two 
events can be expressed in two ways 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴|𝐵𝐵)𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵) = 𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵|𝐴𝐴)𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴) 
Upon dividing both sides by 𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵), we obtain the celebrated Bayes theorem. 
 
𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴|𝐵𝐵) = 𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵|𝐴𝐴)𝑃𝑃(𝐴𝐴)
𝑃𝑃(𝐵𝐵)
 

365 DATA SCIENCE 
 
13
 
The result is spectacular in the sense that it connects the conditional probabilities 
of two events – knowing one of them can give us the other. 
 
In the context of Bayesian statistics, event 𝐴𝐴 is referred to as a hypothesis, 
denoted by 𝐻𝐻, whereas event 𝐵𝐵 is referred to as evidence, denoted by 𝐸𝐸. The 
above result can then be rewritten as 
𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻|𝐸𝐸) = 𝑃𝑃(𝐸𝐸|𝐻𝐻)𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻)
𝑃𝑃(𝐸𝐸)
 
Therefore, to obtain the probability of a hypothesis being true, given some 
piece of evidence, we would need to estimate the probability of the evidence 
being true, given that our hypothesis holds. We would additionally need to 
provide the marginal probabilities of the hypothesis and the evidence being true 
individually. 
 
3.5. Prior, posterior and likelihood 
In the context of Bayesian statistics, each term in Bayes’ theorem bears a 
specific name. 
𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻|𝐸𝐸) = 𝑃𝑃(𝐸𝐸|𝐻𝐻)𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻)
𝑃𝑃(𝐸𝐸)
 
• Prior probability – the probability of the hypothesis being true before 
seeing the evidence. In Bayes’ theorem, it is denoted by 𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻). 
• Posterior probability – the probability of the hypothesis being true after 
seeing the evidence. In Bayes’ theorem, it is denoted by 𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻|𝐸𝐸). 

365 DATA SCIENCE 
 
14
 
• Likelihood function – the probability of the evidence being true given the 
hypothesis holds. In Bayes’ theorem, it is denoted by 𝑃𝑃(𝐸𝐸|𝐻𝐻). 
• The normalization constant – this term makes sure that, once all 
hypotheses have been considered and their conditional probabilities 
calculated, the sum of all posterior probabilities will be 1 (or 100%). 
Mathematically, this is expressed as follows 
෍𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖|𝐸𝐸)
𝑖𝑖=𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=1
= 1 
where 𝑛𝑛 is the number of possible hypotheses. In Bayes’ theorem, the 
normalization constant is denoted by 𝑃𝑃(𝐸𝐸). It is calculated as follows 
𝑃𝑃(𝐸𝐸) = ෍𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖|𝐸𝐸)𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻𝑖𝑖)
𝑖𝑖=𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖=1
 
 
When applying the Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithm, one is typically 
interested in the hypothesis with the largest conditional probability rather than the 
exact value of the conditional probabilities of each hypothesis. Therefore, Bayes’ 
theorem is usually applied in the following form 
𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻|𝐸𝐸) ∝𝑃𝑃(𝐸𝐸|𝐻𝐻)𝑃𝑃(𝐻𝐻) 
This avoids calculating the normalization constant 𝑃𝑃(𝐸𝐸).

4. The Ham or Spam Example 
The setting in which the Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithm is used the 
most is text analysis. The example below is a continuation of the example from 
“The ham-or-spam example” video lecture, as well as the discussion from “The 
YouTube Dataset: Classification” video lecture. 
Example: 
Consider a training dataset consisting of 20 ham and 20 spam messages. 
The marginal (prior) probabilities of an email being ham or spam are therefore 
𝑃𝑃(ham) = 𝑃𝑃(spam) = 1
2 
Let’s further consider the following vocabulary dictionary summarized in Table 2. 
Table 2: Vocabulary dictionary before applying the Laplace smoothing parameter.

According to the table, the word “student” has not appeared in any of the 20 
spam messages. Therefore, even if an incoming message that contains the word 
“student” is spam, it will not be considered as such by the model, as the conditional 
probability of the message being spam would always be 0. The remedy is to 
introduce the so-called smoothing parameter, 𝛼𝛼. Let’s set its value equal to 1 
(Laplace smoothing). The purpose of this parameter is to increase the count of each 
word so that the new counts become the ones in Table 3.

Let’s now apply Bayes’ theorem in the known way. 
P(ham|dear, deadline, student) ∝P(dear, deadline, student|ham)P(ham) 
P(spam|dear, deadline, student) ∝P(dear, deadline, student|spam)P(spam) 
 
 

365 DATA SCIENCE

Therefore 
𝑃𝑃(ham|dear, deadline, student) ∝6
51 ⋅4
51 ⋅16

2 ≈1.4 × 10−3 
𝑃𝑃(spam|dear, deadline, student) ∝4
36 ⋅2
36 ⋅1
36 ⋅1
2 ≈8.6 × 10−5 
To substitute the proportionality sign with an equal sign, we need to further divide 
by 𝑃𝑃(dear, deadline, student). The way we calculate this quantity is as follows 
𝑃𝑃(dear, deadline, student)
= 𝑃𝑃(dear, deadline, student|ham)𝑃𝑃(ham)
+ 𝑃𝑃(dear, deadline, student|spam)𝑃𝑃(spam) 
Therefore, we need to add the two results we have just obtained: 
𝑃𝑃(dear, deadline, student) ≈1.4 × 10−3 + 8.6 × 10−5 = 1.486 × 10−3 
The conditional probabilities for the message to belong to the ham or spam classes 
is the following 
𝑃𝑃(ham|dear, deadline, student) ≈
1.4 × 10−3
1.486 × 10−3 ≈94% 
𝑃𝑃(spam|dear, deadline, student) ≈
8.6 × 10−5
1.486 × 10−3 ≈5.7% 
If the two results are now rounded, their sum would indeed equal 100%. In 
this way, not only did we learn which class the message belongs to, but we also 
managed to calculate the probabilities of the message belonging to either class.

5. Important Steps to Creating a Model 
In this section, we outline the most important steps that need to be executed 
when creating a machine learning model. It is important that these steps are 
executed in the order given below. 
1. Create the DataFrame 
First and foremost, we need to create a pandas DataFrame where all inputs 
and targets are organized. Of course, a pandas DataFrame is not the only way to 
store a database, but it proves to be very useful. You are welcome to experiment 
with other means, but keep in mind that the train_test_split() method accepts the 
inputs and targets in the form of lists, NumPy arrays, SciPy-sparse matrices, as 
well as pandas DataFrames. 
2. Data cleansing – check for null values 
This step is part of the data pre-processing procedure. Before moving 
forward to the next step, do check for any null values in the data. There are various 
techniques to deal with this issue. One would be to remove the samples 
containing missing values altogether. This, however, can be done only if the 
number of such samples is much smaller than the number of all samples in the 
dataset. As a rule of thumb, if the number of samples containing null values is no 
more than 5% of the total number of samples, then removing them from the 
database should be safe. If that is not the case, statistical methods for filling up the 
missing values can be used instead. 

365 DATA SCIENCE 
 
19
 
3. Data cleansing – identify outliers 
This step is part of the data pre-processing procedure. One should identify 
and remove any outliers in the data. The presence of samples with obscure values 
could cause misclassification of samples that would otherwise be classified 
correctly. 
4. Split the data 
Next, split the data into training and testing sets using, for example, 
sklearn’s train_test_split() method. An 80:20 split is very common. It would 
dedicate 80% of the data to the training set and 20% to the test set. Other splits 
such as 90:10, or 70:30 could, of course, be used as well. Use the training data to 
fit the model and the test data to evaluate its performance.  
This step of splitting the data is one of the most common ways to avoid 
overfitting. Overfitting is a phenomenon where a model learns the data so well, 
that it also captures random noise in the data which affects its predictions. This is 
undesirable as random noise would inevitably be present in completely new 
datasets as well. An overtrained model would therefore perform poorly by 
misclassifying many of the points.  
5. Data wrangling 
This step is part of the data pre-processing procedure. In this step, we 
prepare the data for the classifier. Some classifiers, such as K-nearest neighbors, 
are based on distances between the samples. Such algorithms require 
standardized inputs, which usually imply transforming the data. Others, such as the 
Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier, which is mainly used for text analysis, require 

365 DATA SCIENCE 
 
20
 
vocabulary dictionaries in the form of sparse matrices. This would require 
transforming the inputs accordingly.  
Such transformations carry information about the data. In the case of 
standardization, for example, the knowledge on the mean and standard deviation 
is gained. It is, therefore, dangerous to perform such transformations on the whole 
dataset, that is, before train-test splitting. Doing so could lead to data leakage.  
6. Perform the classification 
In this step, the appropriate classifier for the task is chosen, it is fit to the 
training data, and hyperparameters are tuned to achieve maximum performance. 
7. Evaluate the performance of the model 
Once the model is created and finetuned, it is time to test it on a new dataset. 
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are studied in the next 
section. 
6. Relevant Metrics 
In this section, we introduce some of the relevant metrics that could be used 
to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model dealing with a 
classification task. 
 
6.1. The confusion matrix 
 
A confusion matrix is a square 2 × 2, or larger, matrix showing the number of 
(in)correctly predicted samples from each class. 
A confusion matrix, 𝐶𝐶, is constructed such that each entry, 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, equals the 
number of observations known to be in group 𝑖𝑖 and predicted to be in group 𝑗𝑗. 

365 DATA SCIENCE 
 
21
 
Consider a classification problem where each sample in a dataset belongs to 
only one of two classes. We denote these two classes by 0 and 1 and, for the time 
being, define 1 to be the positive class. This would result in the confusion matrix 
from  
Figure 4.

Figure 4: A 2 × 2 confusion matrix denoting the cells representing the true and false positives and negatives. 
Here, class 1 is defined as the positive one. 
 
The matrix consists of the following cells: 
• Top-left cell – true negatives (TN). This is the number of samples whose 
true class is 0 and the model has correctly classified them as such. 
• Top-right cell – false positives (FP). This is the number of samples whose 
true class is 0 but have been incorrectly classified as 1s. 
• Bottom-left cell – false negatives (FN). This is the number of samples whose 
true class is 1 but have been incorrectly classified as 0s. 
• Bottom-right cell – true positives (TP). This is the number of samples whose 
true class is 1 and the model has correctly classified them as such. 

365 DATA SCIENCE

Example: 
 
Figure 5: The figure shows a 2 × 2 confusion matrix in the form of a heatmap. A brighter color designates a 
higher number in the cell. We see that there are 167 true negative samples, 23 false positives, 5 false 
negatives, and 196 true positives. 
 
Consider now a classification problem where each sample in a dataset 
belongs to one of three classes, 0, 1, or 2, with class 1 again defined as the 
positive class. This makes classes 0 and 2 negative. The confusion matrix would 
then look the one in

Example: 
 
Figure 7: The figure shows a confusion matrix in the form of a heatmap. A brighter color designates a higher 
number in the cell. 
Making use of these confusion matrices, we will introduce 4 useful metrics 
for evaluating the performance of a classifier. In Section 6.6, we construct a table 
summarizing all findings. 
 
6.2. Accuracy 
 
Accuracy =
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹+ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹+ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 
Example 1: 
Using the confusion matrix from Figure 5, let’s calculate the accuracy of the 
model. 
Accuracy =
167 + 196
167 + 23 + 5 + 196 ≈0.93 
The ratio between the number of all correctly 
predicted samples and the number of all samples.

Example 2: 
Using the confusion matrix from Figure 7, let’s calculate the accuracy of the 
model. 
Accuracy =
195 + 186 + 163
195 + 5 + 0 + 5 + 186 + 9 + 3 + 34 + 163 ≈0.91 
 
6.3. Precision 
 
Precision =
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 
Example 1: 
Using the confusion matrix from Figure 5, let’s calculate the precision of the 
model for both classes. To calculate the precision for class 0, we define that class as 
positive, while class 1 becomes negative. Applying the formula above, we obtain 
Precision0 =
167
167 + 5 ≈0.97 
Analogously, to calculate the precision for class 1, we define that class as positive, 
while class 0 becomes negative. Applying the definition, we obtain 
Precision1 =
196
196 + 23 ≈0.89 
Example 2: 
 Using the confusion matrix from Figure 7, let’s calculate the precision of the 
model for all three classes. To calculate the precision for class 0, we define that class 
The ratio between the number of true positives and

as positive, while classes 1 and 2 become negative. Applying the definition, we 
obtain 
Precision0 =
195
195 + 5 + 3 ≈0.96 
Analogously, the precisions for classes 1 and 2 are: 
Precision1 =

186 + 5 + 34 ≈0.83 
Precision2 =

6.4. Recall 
 
 
Recall =
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+ 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 
Example 1: 
Using the confusion matrix from Figure 5, let’s calculate the recall of the 
model for both classes. To calculate the recall for class 0, we define that class as 
positive, while class 1 becomes negative. Applying the formula above, we obtain 
Recall0 =
167
167 + 23 ≈0.88 
Analogously, to calculate the recall for class 1, we define that class as positive, 
while class 0 becomes negative. Applying the definition, we obtain 
Recall1 =
196
196 + 5 ≈0.98

number of all samples whose true class is the positive one.

Example 2: 
 Using the confusion matrix from Figure 7, let’s calculate the recall of the 
model for all three classes. To calculate the precision for class 0, we define that 
class as positive, while classes 1 and 2 become negative. Applying the definition, 
we obtain 
Recall0 =
195
195 + 5 + 0 ≈0.98 
Analogously, the precisions for classes 1 and 2 are: 
Recall1 =
186
186 + 5 + 9 ≈0.93 
Recall2 =
163
163 + 3 + 34 ≈0.82 
 
6.5. F1 score 
 
 
F1 =
2
1
precision +
1
recall
 
The F1 score can be thought of as putting precision and recall into a single 
metric. Contrary to taking the simple arithmetic mean of precision and recall, the 
F1 score penalizes low values more heavily. That is to say, if either precision or 
recall is very low, while the other is high, the F1 score would be significantly lower 
compared to the ordinary arithmetic mean.  
In the examples below, we calculate the F1 score for class 0 for both the 2 × 2 
and the 3 × 3 confusion matrices. Calculating the F1 score for the rest of the classes

is left as an exercise to the reader. The answers are provided in Section 6.6 with a 
table summarizing the results from all metrics.  
Example 1: 
Using the confusion matrix from Figure 5, we calculated the precision and 
recall values for class 0 to be 0.97 and 0.88, respectively. Applying the definition, the 
F1 score is  
F1 =
2
1
0.97 +
1
0.88
≈0.923 
In contrast, the arithmetic mean is 
Arithmetic mean = 0.97 + 0.88
2
= 0.925 
We see that the arithmetic mean is slightly larger than the F1 score. The difference 
here is not big as both precision and recall are quite high in value. The discrepancy 
between the F1 score and the arithmetic mean would be much more apparent if the 
difference between precision and recall is much larger.   
Example 2: 
Using the confusion matrix from Figure 7, we calculated the precision and 
recall values for class 0 to be 0.96 and 0.98, respectively. Applying the definition, the 
F1 score is  
F1 =
2
1
0.96 +
1
0.98
≈0.970 
In contrast, the arithmetic mean is 
Arithmetic mean = 0.96 + 0.98
2
= 0.97

When precision is almost equal to recall, the F1 score and the arithmetic mean bear 
almost the same value.

In Table 4 and Table 5, we summarize the results of both confusion 
matrices. This is known as a classification report.

Appendix 
Bayes’ Thought Experiment 
In this simplified version of the problem, we aim at showing that, as new 
knowledge is gained, the predictions become more and more accurate. 
With each toss of the blue ball, the number of possible spots for the red ball 
becomes smaller and smaller. In Figure 10 to Figure 12 below, you can see the 
possible choices going from 81 down to 4. In Figure 13, the original setup of the 
problem is revealed.
