INTRODUCTION 
 
There is a Need 
 
Does school prepare children for the real world? "Study hard and get good 
grades and you will find a high-paying job with great benefits," my parents used 
to say. Their goal in life was to provide a college education for my older 
sister and me, so that we would have the greatest chance for success in life. 
When T finally earned my diploma in 1976-graduating with honors, and near the 
top of my class, in accounting from Florida State University-my parents had 
realized their goal. It was the crowning achievement of their lives. In 
accordance with the "Master Plan," I was hired by a "Big 8" accounting firm, and 
I looked forward to a long career and retirement at an early age. 
My husband, Michael, followed a similar path. We both came from hard-
working families, of modest means but with strong work ethics. Michael also 
graduated with honors, but he did it twice: first as an engineer and then from 
law school. He was quickly recruited by a prestigious Washington, D.C., law firm 
that specialized in patent law, and his future seemed bright, career path well-
defined and early retirement guaranteed. 
Although we have been successful in our careers, they have not turned out 
quite as we expected. We both have changed positions several times-for all the 
right reasons-but there are no pension plans vesting on our behalf. Our 
retirement funds are growing only through our individual contributions. 
Michael and I have a wonderful marriage with three great children. As I 
write this, two are in college and one is just beginning high school. We have

spent a fortune making sure our children have received the best education 
available. 
One day in 1996, one of my children came home disillusioned with school. 
He was bored and tired of studying. "Why should I put time into studying 
subjects I will never use in real life?" he protested. 
Without thinking, I responded, "Because if you don't get good grades, you 
won't get into college." 
"Regardless of whether I go to college," he replied, "I'm going to be 
rich." 
"If you don't graduate from college, you won't get a good job," I 
responded with a tinge of panic and motherly concern. "And if you don't have a 
good job, how do you plan to get rich?" 
My son smirked and slowly shook his head with mild boredom. We have had 
this talk many times before. He lowered his head and rolled his eyes. My words 
of motherly wisdom were falling on deaf ears once again. 
Though smart and strong-willed, he has always been a polite and respectful 
young man. 
"Mom," he began. It was my turn to be lectured. "Get with the times! Look 
around; the richest people didn't get rich because of their educations. Look at 
Michael Jordan and Madonna. Even Bill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard, founded 
Microsoft; he is now the richest man in America, and he's still in his 30s. 
There is a baseball pitcher who makes more than $4 million a year even though he 
has been labeled `mentally challenged.' " 
There was a long silence between us. It was dawning on me that I was 
giving my son the same advice my parents had given me. The world around us has 
changed, but the advice hasn't. 
Getting a good education and making good grades no longer ensures success, 
and nobody seems to have noticed, except our children. 
"Mom," he continued, "I don't want to work as hard as you and dad do. You 
make a lot of money, and we live in a huge house with lots of toys. If I follow 
your advice, I'll wind up like you, working harder and harder only to pay more 
taxes and wind up in debt. There is no job security anymore; I know all about 
downsizing and rightsizing. I also know that college graduates today earn less 
than you did when you graduated. Look at doctors. They don't make nearly as much 
money as they used to. I know I can't rely on Social Security or company 
pensions for retirement. I need new answers." 
He was right. He needed new answers, and so did I. My parents' advice may 
have worked for people born before 1945, but it may be disastrous for those of 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
us born into a rapidly changing world. No longer can I simply say to my children, 
"Go to school, get good grades, and look for a safe, secure job." 
I knew I had to look for new ways to guide my children's education. 
As a mother as well as an accountant, I have been concerned by the lack of 
financial education our children receive in school. Many of today's youth have 
credit cards before they leave high school, yet they have never had a course in 
money or how to invest it, let alone understand how compound interest works on 
credit cards. Simply put, without financial literacy and the knowledge of how 
money works, they are not prepared to face the world that awaits them, a world 
in which spending is emphasized over savings. 
When my oldest son became hopelessly in debt with his credit cards as a 
freshman in college, I not only helped him destroy the credit cards, but I also 
went in search of a program that would help me educate my children on financial 
matters. 
One day last year, my husband called me from his office. "I have someone I 
think you should meet," he said. "His name is Robert Kiyosaki. He's a 
businessman and investor, and he is here applying for a patent on an educational 
product. I think it's what you have been looking for." 
 
Just What I Was Looking For 
 
My husband, Mike, was so impressed with CASHFLOW, the new educational 
product that Robert Kiyosaki was developing, that he arranged for both of us to 
participate in a test of the prototype. Because it was an educational game, I 
also asked my 19-year-old daughter, who was a freshman at a local university, if 
she would like to take part, and she agreed. 
About fifteen people, broken into three groups, participated in the test. 
Mike was right. It was the educational product I had been looking for. But 
it had a twist: It looked like a colorful Monopoly board with a giant well-
dressed rat in the middle. Unlike Monopoly, however, there were two tracks: one 
inside and one outside. The object of the game was to get out of the inside 
track-what Robert called the "Rat Race" and reach the outer track, or the "Fast 
Track." As Robert put it, the Fast Track simulates how rich people play in real 
life. 
Robert then defined the "Rat Race" for us. 
"If you look at the life of the average-educated, hard-working person, 
there is a similar path. The child is born and goes to school. The proud parents 
are excited because the child excels, gets fair to good grades, and is accepted 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
into a college. The child graduates, maybe goes on to graduate school and then 
does exactly as programmed: looks for a safe, secure job or career. The child 
finds that job, maybe as a doctor or a lawyer, or joins the Army or works for 
the government. Generally, the child begins to make money, credit cards start to 
arrive in mass, and the shopping begins, if it already hasn't. 
"Having money to burn, the child goes to places where other young people 
just like them hang out, and they meet people, they date, and sometimes they get 
married. Life is wonderful now, because today, both men and women work. Two 
incomes are bliss. They feel successful, their future is bright, and they decide 
to buy a house, a car, a television, take vacations and have children. The happy 
bundle arrives. The demand for cash is enormous. The happy couple decides that 
their careers are vitally important and begin to work harder, seeking promotions 
and raises. The raises come, and so does another child and the need for a bigger 
house. They work harder, become better employees, even more dedicated. They go 
back to school to get more specialized skills so they can earn more money. Maybe 
they take a second job. Their incomes go up, but so does the tax bracket they're 
in and the real estate taxes on their new large home, and their Social Security 
taxes, and all the other taxes. They get their large paycheck and wonder where 
all the money went. They buy some mutual funds and buy groceries with their 
credit card. The children reach 5 or 6 years of age, and the need to save for 
college increases as well as the need to save for their retirement. . 
"That happy couple, born 35 years ago, is now trapped in the Rat Race for 
the rest of their working days. They work for the owners of their company, for 
the government paying taxes, and for the bank paying off a mortgage and credit 
cards. 
"Then, they advise their own children to `study hard, get good grades, and 
find a safe job or career.' They learn nothing about money, except from those 
who profit from their naïveté, and work hard all their lives. The process 
repeats into another hard-working generation. This is the `Rat Race'." 
The only way to get out of the "Rat Race" is to prove your proficiency at 
both accounting and investing, arguably two of the most difficult subjects to 
master. As a trained CPA who once worked for a Big 8 accounting firm, I was 
surprised that Robert had made the learning of these two subjects both fun and 
exciting. The process was so well disguised that while we were diligently 
working to get out of the "Rat Race," we quickly forgot we were learning. 
Soon a product test turned into a fun afternoon with my daughter, talking 
about things we had never discussed before. As an accountant, playing a game 
that required an Income Statement and Balance Sheet was easy. So I had the time 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
to help my daughter and the other players at my table with concepts they did not 
understand. I was the first person-and the only person in the entire test group-
to get out of the "Rat Race" that day. I was out within 50 minutes, although the 
game went on for nearly three hours. 
At my table was a banker, a business owner and a computer programmer. What 
greatly disturbed me was how little these people knew about either accounting or 
investing, subjects so important in their lives. I wondered how they managed 
their own financial affairs in real life. I could understand why my 19-year-old 
daughter would not understand, but these were grown adults, at least twice her 
age. 
After I was out of the "Rat Race," for the next two hours I watched my 
daughter and these educated, affluent adults roll the dice and move their 
markers. Although I was glad they were all learning so much, I was disturbed by 
how much the adults did not know about the basics of simple accounting and 
investing. They had difficulty grasping the relationship between their Income 
Statement and their Balance Sheet. As they bought and sold assets, they had 
trouble remembering that each transaction could impact their monthly cash flow. 
I thought, how many millions of people are out there in the real world 
struggling financially, only because they have never been taught these subjects? 
Thank goodness they're having fun and are distracted by the desire to win 
the game, I said to myself. After Robert ended the contest, he allowed us 
fifteen minutes to discuss and critique CASHFLOW among ourselves. 
The business owner at my table was not happy. He did not like the game. "I 
don't need to know this," he said out loud. "I hire accountants, bankers and 
attorneys to tell me about this stuff." 
To which Robert replied, "Have you ever noticed that there are a lot of 
accountants who aren't rich? And bankers, and attorneys, and stockbrokers and 
real estate brokers. They know a lot, and for the most part are smart people, 
but most of them are not rich. Since our schools do not teach people what the 
rich know, we take advice from these people. But one day, you're driving down 
the highway, stuck in traffic, struggling to get to work, and you look over to 
your right and you see your accountant stuck in the same traffic jam. You look 
to your left and you see your banker. That should tell you something." 
The computer programmer was also unimpressed by the game: "I can buy 
software to teach me this." 
The banker, however, was moved. "I studied this in school-the accounting 
part, that is-but I never knew how to apply it to real life. Now I know. I need 
to get myself out of the `Rat Race.' " 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
But it was my daughter's comments that most touched me. "I had fun 
learning," she said. "I learned a lot about how money really works and how to 
invest." 
Then she added: "Now I know I can choose a profession for the work I want 
to perform and not because of job security, benefits or howmuch I get paid. If I 
learn what this game teaches, I'm free to do and study what my heart wants to 
study. . .rather than study something because businesses are looking for certain 
job skills. If I learn this, I won't have to worry about job security and Social 
Security the way most of my classmates already do." 
I was not able to stay and talk with Robert after we had played the game, 
but we agreed to meet later to further discuss his project. I knew he wanted to 
use the game to help others become more financially savvy, and I was eager to 
hear more about his plans. 
My husband and I set up a dinner meeting with Robert and his wife within 
the next week. Although it was our first social get-together, we felt as if we 
had known each other for years. 
We found out we had a lot in common. We covered the gamut, from sports and 
plays to restaurants and socio-economic issues. We talked about the changing 
world. We spent a lot of time discussing how most Americans have little or 
nothing saved for retirement, as well as the almost bankrupt state of Social 
Security and Medicare. Would my children be required to pay for the retirement 
of 75 million baby boomers? We wondered if people realize how risky it is to 
depend on a 
pension plan. 
Robert's primary concern was the growing gap between the haves and have 
nots, in America and around the world. A self-taught, self-made entrepreneur who 
traveled the world putting investments together, Robert was able to retire at 
the age of 47. He came out of retirement because he shares the same concern I 
have for my own children. He knows that the world has changed, but education has 
not changed with it. According to Robert, children spend years in an antiquated 
educational system, studying subjects they will never use, preparing for a world 
that no longer exists. 
"Today, the most dangerous advice you can give a child is `Go to school, 
get good grades and look for a safe secure job,' " he likes to say. "That is old 
advice, and it's bad advice. If you could see what is happening in Asia, Europe, 
South America, you would be as concerned as I am." 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
It's bad advice, he believes, "because if you want your child to have a 
financially secure future, they can't play by the old set of rules. It's just 
too risky." 
I asked him what he meant by "old rules?" . 
"People like me play by a different set of rules from what you play by," 
he said. "What happens when a corporation announces a downsizing?" 
"People get laid off," I said. "Families are hurt. Unemployment goes 
up." 
"Yes, but what happens to the company, in particular a public company on 
the stock exchange?" 
"The price of the stock usually goes up when the downsizing is announced," 
I said. "The market likes it when a company reduces its labor costs, either 
through automation or just consolidating the labor force in general." 
"That's right," he said. "And when stock prices go up, people like me, the 
shareholders, get richer. That is what I mean by a different set of rules. 
Employees lose; owners and investors win." 
Robert was describing not only the difference between an employee and 
employer, but also the difference between controlling your own destiny and 
giving up that control to someone else. 
"But it's hard for most people to understand why that happens," I said. 
"They just think it's not fair." 
"That's why it is foolish to simply say to a child, `Get a good 
education,' " he said. "It is foolish to assume that the education the school 
system provides will prepare your children for the world they will face upon 
graduation. Each child needs more education. Different education. And they need 
to know the rules. The different sets of rules." 
"There are rules of money that the rich play by, and there are the rules 
that the other 95 percent of the population plays by," he said. "And the 95 
percent learns those rules at home and in school. That is why it's risky today 
to simply say to a child, `Study hard and look for a job.' A child today needs a 
more sophisticated education, and the current system is not delivering the goods. 
I don't care how many computers they put in the classroom or how much money 
schools spend. How can the education system teach a subject that it does not 
know?" 
So how does a parent teach their children, what the school does not? How 
do you teach accounting to a child? Won't they get bored? And how do you teach 
investing when as a parent you yourself are risk averse? Instead of teaching my 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
children to simply play it safe, I decided it was best to teach them to play it 
smart. 
"So how would you teach a child about money and all the things we've 
talked about?" I asked Robert. "How can we make it easy for parents especially 
when they don't understand it themselves?" 
"I wrote a book on the subject, " he said. 
"Where is it?" 
"In my computer. It's been there for years in random pieces. I add to it 
occasionally but I've never gotten around to put it all together. I began 
writing it after my other book became a best seller, but I never finished the 
new one. It's in pieces." 
And in pieces it was. After reading the scattered sections, I decided the 
book had merit and needed to be shared, especially in these changing times. We 
agreed to co-author Robert's book. 
I asked him how much financial information he thought a child needed. He 
said it would depend on the child. He knew at a young age that he wanted to be 
rich and was fortunate enough to have a father figure who was rich and willing 
to guide him. Education is the foundation of success, Robert said. Just as 
scholastic skills are vitally important, so are financial skills and 
communication skills. 
What follows is the story of Robert's two dads, a rich one and a poor 
one, that expounds on the skills he's developed over a lifetime. The 
contrast between two dads provides an important perspective. The book is 
supported, edited and assembled by me. For any accountants who read this book, 
suspend your academic book knowledge and open your mind to the theories Robert 
presents. Although many of them challenge the very fundamentals of generally 
accepted accounting principles, they provide a valuable insight into the way 
true investors analyze their investment decisions. 
When we as parents advise our children to "go to school, study hard and 
get a good job," we often do that out of cultural habit. It has always been the 
right thing to do. When I met Robert, his ideas initially startled me. Having 
been raised by two fathers, he had been taught to strive for two different goals. 
His educated dad advised him to work for a corporation. His rich dad advised him 
to own the corporation. Both life paths required education, but the subjects of 
study were completely different. His educated dad encouraged Robert to be a 
smart person. His rich dad encouraged Robert to know how to hire smart people. 
Having two dads caused many problems. Robert's real dad was the 
superintendent of education for the state of Hawaii. By the time Robert was 16, 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
the threat of "If you don't get good grades, you won't get a good job" had 
little effect. He already knew his career path was to own corporations, not to 
work for them. In fact, if it had not been for a wise and persistent high school 
guidance counselor, Robert might not have gone on to college. He admits that. He 
was eager to start building his assets, but finally agreed that the college 
education would also be a benefit to him. 
Truthfully, the ideas in this book are probably too far fetched and 
radical for most parents today. Some parents are having a hard enough time 
simply keeping their children in school. But in light of our changing times, as 
parents we need to be open to new and bold ideas. To encourage children to be 
employees is to advise your children to pay more than their fair share of taxes 
over a lifetime, with little or no promise of a pension. And it is true that 
taxes are a person's greatest expense. In fact, most families work from January 
to mid-May for the government just to cover their taxes. New ideas are needed 
and this book provides them. 
Robert claims that the rich teach their children differently. They teach 
their children at home, around the dinner table. These ideas may notbe the ideas 
you choose to discuss with your children, but thank you for looking at them. And 
I advise you to keep searching. In my opinion, as a mom and a CPA, the concept 
of simply getting good grades and finding a good job is an old idea. We need to 
advise our children with a greater degree of sophistication. We need new ideas 
and different education. Maybe telling our children to strive to be good 
employees while also striving to own their own investment corporation is not 
such a bad idea. 
It is my hope as a mother that this book helps other parents. It is 
Robert's hope to inform people that anyone can achieve prosperity if they so 
choose. If today you are a gardener or a janitor or even unemployed, you have 
the ability to educate yourself and teach those you love to take care of 
themselves financially. Remember that financial intelligence is the mental 
process via which we solve our financial problems. 
Today we are facing global and technological changes as great or even 
greater than those ever faced before. No one has a crystal ball, but one thing 
is for certain: Changes lie ahead that are beyond our reality. Who knows what 
the future brings? But whatever happens, we have two fundamental choices: play 
it safe or play it smart by preparing, getting educated and awakening your own 
and your children's financial genius. - Sbaron Lecbter

1. CHAPTER ONE 
Rich Dad, Poor Dad 
As narrated by Robert Kiyosaki 
 
I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated and 
intelligent; he had a Ph.D. and completed four years of undergraduate work in 
less than two years. He then went on to Stanford University, the University of 
Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his advanced studies, all on full 
financial scholarships. The other father never finished the eighth grade. 
Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives. 
Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one struggled financially all his life. The 
other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of 
millions of dollars to his family, charities and his church. The other left 
bills to be paid. 
Both men were strong, charismatic and influential. Both men offered me 
advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in 
education but did not recommend the same course of study. 
If I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice. 
Having two dads advising me offered me the choice of contrasting points of view; 
one of a rich man and one of a poor man. 
Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself 
thinking more, comparing and then choosing for myself. 
The problem was, the rich man was not rich yet and the poor man not yet 
poor. Both were just starting out on their careers, and both were struggling 
with money and families. But they had very different points of view about the 
subject of money. 
For example, one dad would say, "The love of money is the root of all 
evil." The other, "The lack of money is the root of all evil." 
As a young boy, having two strong fathers both influencing me was 
difficult. I wanted to be a good son and listen, but the two fathers did not say 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
the same things. The contrast in their points of view, particularly where money 
was concerned, was so extreme that I grew curious and intrigued. I began to 
start thinking for long periods of time about what each was saying. 
Much of my private time was spent reflecting, asking myself questions such 
as, "Why does he say that?" and then asking the same question of the other dad's 
statement. It would have been much easier to simply say, "Yeah, he's right. I 
agree with that." Or to simply reject the point of view by saying, "The old man 
doesn't know what he's talking about." Instead, having two dads whom I loved 
forced me to think and ultimately choose a way of thinking for myself. As a 
process, choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in the long run, 
rather than simply accepting or rejecting a single point of view. 
One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the 
middle class struggles in debt is because the subject of money is taught at home, 
not in school. Most of us learn about money from our parents. So what can a poor 
parent tell their child about money? They simply say "Stay in school and study 
hard." The child may graduate with excellent grades but with a poor person's 
financial programming and mind-set. It was learned while the child was young. 
Money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and 
professional skills, but not on financial skills. This explains how smart 
bankers, doctors and accountants who earned excellent grades in school may still 
struggle financially all of their lives. Our staggering national debt is due in 
large part to highly educated politicians and government officials making 
financial decisions with little or no training on the subject of money. 
I often look ahead to the new millennium and wonder what will happen when 
we have millions of people who will need financial and medical assistance. They 
will be dependent on their families or the government for financial support. 
What will happen when Medicare and Social Security run out of money? How will a 
nation survive if teaching children about money continues to be left to parents-
most of whom will be, or already are, poor? 
Because I had two influential fathers, I learned from both of them. I had 
to think about each dad's advice, and in doing so, I gained valuable 
insight into the power and effect of one's thoughts on one's life. For 
example, one dad had a habit of saying, "I can't afford it." The other dad 
forbade those words to be used. He insisted I say, "How can I afford it?" One is 
a statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the 
other forces you to think. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by 
automatically saying the words "I can't afford it," your brain stops working. By 
asking the question "How can I afford it?" your brain is put to work. He did not 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
mean buy everything you wanted. He was fanatical about exercising your mind, the 
most powerful computer in the world. "My brain gets stronger every day because I 
exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make." He believed that 
automatically saying "I can't afford it" was a sign of mental laziness. 
Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that one dad had a habit of 
putting his brain to sleep when it came to money matters, and the other had a 
habit of exercising his brain. The long-term result was that one dad grew 
stronger financially and the other grew weaker. It is not much different from a 
person who goes to the gym to exercise on a regular basis versus someone who 
sits on the couch watching television. Proper physical exercise increases your 
chances for health, and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth. 
Laziness decreases both health and wealth. 
My two dads had opposing attitudes in thought. One dad thought that the 
rich should pay more in taxes to take care of those less fortunate. The other 
said, "Taxes punish those who produce and reward those who don't produce." 
One dad recommended, "Study hard so you can find a good company to work 
for." The other recommended, "Study hard so you can find a good company to buy." 
One dad said, "The reason I'm not rich is because I have you kids." The 
other said, "The reason I must be rich is because I have you kids." 
One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner ,table. The 
other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal. 
One said, "When it comes to money, play it safe, don't take risks." The 
other said, "Learn to manage risk." 
One believed, "Our home is our largest investment and our greatest asset." 
The other believed, "My house is a liability, and if your house is your largest 
investment, you're in trouble." 
Both dads paid their bills on time, yet one paid his bills first while the 
other paid his bills last. 
One dad believed in a company or the government taking care of you and 
your needs. He was always concerned about pay raises, retirement plans, medical 
benefits, sick leave, vacation days and other perks. He was impressed with two 
of his uncles who joined the military and earned a retirement and entitlement 
package for life after twenty years of active service. He loved the idea of 
medical benefits and PX privileges the military provided its retirees. He also 
loved the tenure system available through the university. The idea of job 
protection for life and job benefits seemed more important, at times, than the 
job. He would often say, "I've worked hard for the government, and I'm entitled 
to these benefits." 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
The other believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against 
the "entitlement" mentality and how it was creating weak and financially needy 
people. He was emphatic about being financially competent. 
One dad struggled to save a few dollars. The other simply created 
investments. 
One dad taught me how to write an impressive resume so I could find a good 
job. The other taught me how to write strong business and financial plans so I 
could create jobs. 
Being a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of observing the 
effects different thoughts have on one's life. I noticed that people really do 
shape their life through their thoughts. 
For example, my poor dad always said, "I'll never be rich." And that 
prophesy became reality. My rich dad, on the other hand, always referred to 
himself as rich. He would say things like, "I'm a rich man, and rich people 
don't do this." Even when he was flat broke after a major financial setback, he 
continued to refer to himself as a rich man. He would cover himself by saying, 
"There is a difference between being poor and being broke. - Broke is temporary, 
and poor is eternal." 
My poor dad would also say, "I'm not interested in money," or "Money 
doesn't matter." My rich dad always said, "Money is power." 
The power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, but it 
became obvious to me as a young boy to be aware of my thoughts and how I 
expressed myself. I noticed that my poor dad was poor not because of the amount 
of money he earned, which was significant, but 
because of his thoughts and actions. As a young boy, having two fathers, I 
became acutely aware of being careful which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own. 
Whom should I listen to-my rich dad or my poor dad? 
Although both men had tremendous respect for education and learning, they 
disagreed in what they thought was important to learn. One wanted me to study 
hard, earn a degree and get a good job to work for money. He wanted me to study 
to become a professional, an attorney or an accountant or to go to business 
school for my MBA. The other encouraged me to study to be rich, to understand 
how money works and to learn how to have it work for me. "I don't work for 
money!" were words he would repeat over and over, "Money works for me!" 
At the age of 9, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich dad about 
money. In doing so, I chose not to listen to my poor dad, even though he was the 
one with all the college degrees.

A Lesson From Robert Frost 
 
Robert Frost is my favourite poet. Although I love many of his poems, my 
favorite is The Road Not Taken. I use its lesson almost daily: 
 
The Road Not Taken 
 
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And 
be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it 
bent in the undergrowth; 
Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, 
Because it was grassy and wanted wear Though as for that the passing there Had 
worn them really about the same, 
And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, 
I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads onto way, I doubted 
if I should ever come back. 
I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence; Two 
roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, And that has made 
all the difference. 
Robert Frost(1916) 
 
And that made all the difference. 
Over the years, I have often reflected upon Robert Frost's poem. Choosing 
not to listen to my highly educated dad's advice and attitude about money was a 
painful decision, but it was a decision that shaped the rest of my life. 
Once I made up my mind whom to listen to, my education about money began. 
My rich dad taught me over a period of 30 years, until I was age 39. He stopped 
once he realized that I knew and fully understood what he had been trying to 
drum into my often thick skull. 
Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial 
education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money 
works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth. The reason positive 
thinking alone does not work is because most people went to school and never 
learned how money works, so they spend their lives working for money. 
Because I was only 9 years old when I started, the lessons my rich dad 
taught me were simple. And when it was all said and done, there were only six 
main lessons, repeated over 30 years. This book is about those six lessons, put 
as simply as possible as my rich dad put forth those lessons to me. The lessons 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
are not meant to be answers but guideposts. Guideposts that will assist you and 
your children to grow wealthier no matter what happens in a world of increasing 
change and uncertainty.

2. CHAPTER TWO  
Lesson One: The Rich Don't Work For Money 
 
"Dad, Can You Tell Me How to Get Rich?" 
My dad put down the evening paper. "Why do you want to get rich, son?" 
"Because today Jimmy's mom drove up in their new Cadillac, and they were 
going to their beach house for the weekend. He took three of his friends, but 
Mike and I weren't invited. They told us we weren't invited because we were 
`poor kids'." 
"They did?" my dad asked incredulously. 
"Yeah, they did." I replied in a hurt tone. 
My dad silently shook his head, pushed his glasses up the bridge of his 
nose and went back to reading the paper. I stood waiting for an answer. 
The year was 1956. I was 9 years old. By some twist of fate, I attended 
the same public school where the rich people sent their kids. We were primarily 
a sugar plantation town. The managers of the plantation and the other affluent 
people of the town, such as doctors, business owners, and bankers, sent their 
children to this school, grades 1 to 6. After grade 6, their children were 
generally sent off to private schools. Because my family lived on one side of 
the street, I went to this school. Had I lived on the other side of the street, 
I would have gone to a different school, with kids from families more like mine. 
After grade 6,these kids and I would go on to the public intermediate and high 
school. There was no private school for them or for me. 
My dad finally put down the paper. I could tell he was thinking. 
"Well, son," he began slowly. "If you want to be rich, you have to learn 
to make money." 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"How do I make money?" I asked. 
"Well, use your head, son," he said, smiling. Which really meant, "That's 
all I'm going to tell you," or "I don't know the answer, so don't embarrass me." 
 
A Partnership Is Formed 
 
The next morning, I told my best friend, Mike, what my dad had said. As 
best I could tell, Mike and I were the only poor kids in this school. Mike was 
like me in that he was in this school by a twist of fate. Someone had drawn a 
jog in the line for the school district, and we wound up in school with the rich 
kids. We weren't really poor, but we felt as if we were because all the other 
boys had new baseball gloves, ,,,y 
new bicycles, new everything. 
Mom and dad provided us with the basics, like food, shelter, clothes. :, 
But that was about it. My dad used to say, "If you want something, work for it." 
We wanted things, but there was not much work available for 9- , year-old boys. 
"So what do we do to make money?" Mike asked. 
"I don't know," I said. "But do you want to be my partner?" 
He agreed and so on that Saturday morning, Mike became my first business 
partner. We spent all morning coming up with ideas on how to 1'make money. 
Occasionally we talked about all the "cool guys" at Jimmy's beach house having 
fun. It hurt a little, but that hurt was good, for it inspired us to keep 
thinking of a way to make money. Finally, that afternoon, a bolt of lightning 
came through our heads. It was an idea Mike had gotten from a science book he 
had read. Excitedly, we shook hands, and the partnership now had a business. 
For the next several weeks, Mike and I ran around our neighborhood, 
knocking on doors and asking our neighbors if they would save their toothpaste 
tubes for us. With puzzled looks, most adults consented with a smile. Some asked 
us what we were doing. To which we replied, "We can't tell you. It's a business 
secret." 
My mom grew distressed as the weeks wore on. We had selected a 
site next to her washing machine as the place we would stockpile our raw 
materials. In a brown cardboard box that one time held catsup bottles, our 
little pile of used toothpaste tubes began to grow. 
Finally my mom put her foot down. The sight of her neighbors' , messy, 
crumpled used toothpaste tubes had gotten to her. "What are you boys doing?" she 
asked. "And I don't want to hear again that it's a business secret. Do something 
with this mess or I'm going to throw it out." 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Mike and I pleaded and begged, explaining that we would soon have enough 
and then we would begin production. We informed her that we were waiting on a 
couple of neighbors to finish using up their toothpaste so we could have their 
tubes. Mom granted us a one-week extension. 
The date to begin production was moved up. The pressure was on. My first 
partnership was already being threatened with an eviction notice from our 
warehouse space by my own mom. It became Mike's job to tell the neighbors to 
quickly use up their toothpaste, saying their dentist wanted them to brush more 
often anyway. I began to put together the production line. 
One day my dad drove up with a friend to see two 9-year-old boys . in the 
driveway with a production line operating at full speed. There was fine white 
powder everywhere. On a long table were small milk cartons from school, and our 
family's hibachi grill was glowing with red hot coals at maximum heat. 
Dad walked up cautiously, having to park the car at the base of the 
driveway, since the production line blocked the carport. As he and his friend 
got closer, they saw a steel pot sitting on top of the coals, with the 
toothpaste tubes being melted down. In those days, toothpaste did not come in 
plastic tubes. The tubes were made of lead. So once the paint was burned off, 
the tubes were dropped in the small steel pot, melted until they became liquid, 
and with my mom's pot holders we were pouring the lead through a small hole in 
the top of the milk cartons. 
The milk cartons were filled with plaster-of-Paris. The white powder 
everywhere was the plaster before we mixed it with water. In my haste, I had 
knocked the bag over, and the entire area look like it had been hit by a 
snowstorm. The milk cartons were the outer containers for plaster-of-Paris molds. 
My dad and his friend watched as we carefully poured the molten lead 
through a small hole in the top of the plaster-of-Paris cube. 
"Careful," my dad said. 
I nodded without looking up. 
Finally, once the pouring was through, I put the steel pot down and smiled 
at my dad. 
"What are you boys doing?" he asked with a cautious smile. 
"We're doing what you told me to do. We're going to be rich," I said. 
"Yup," said Mike, grinning and nodding his head. "We're partners." 
"And what is in those plaster molds?" dad asked. 
"Watch," I said. "This should be a good batch." 
With a small hammer, I tapped at the seal that divided the cube in 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
half. Cautiously, I pulled up the top half of the plaster mold and a lead 
nickel fell out." 
"Oh, my God!" my dad said. "You're casting nickels out of lead." 
"That's right," Mike said. "We doing as you told us to do. We're making 
money." 
My dad's friend turned and burst into laughter. My dad smiled and shook 
his head. Along with a fire and a box of spent toothpaste tubes, in front of him 
were two little boys covered with white dust and smiling from ear to ear. 
He asked us to put everything down and sit with him on the front step of 
our house. With a smile, he gently explained what the word "counterfeiting" 
meant. 
Our dreams were dashed. "You mean this is illegal?" asked Mike in a 
quivering voice. 
"Let them go," my dad's friend said. "They might be developing a natural 
talent." 
My dad glared at him. 
"Yes, it is illegal," my dad said gently. "But you boys have shown great 
creativity and original thought. Keep going. I'm really proud of you!" 
Disappointed, Mike and I sat in silence for about twenty minutes before we 
began cleaning up our mess. The business was over on opening day. Sweeping the 
powder up, I looked at Mike and said, "I guess Jimmy and his friends are right. 
We are poor." 
My father was just leaving as I said that. "Boys," he said. "You're only 
poor if you give up. The most important thing is that you did something. Most 
people only talk and dream of getting rich. You've done something. I'm very 
proud of the two of you. I will say it again. 
Keep going. Don't quit." 
Mike and I stood there in silence. They were nice words, but we still did 
not know what to do. 
"So how come you're not rich, dad?" I asked. 
"Because I chose to be a schoolteacher. Schoolteachers really don't think 
about being rich. We just like to teach. I wish I could help you, but I really 
don't know how to make money." 
Mike and I turned and continued our clean up. 
"I know," said my dad. "If you boys want to learn how to be rich, don't 
ask me. Talk to your dad, Mike." 
"My dad?" asked Mike with a scrunched up face. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"Yeah, your dad," repeated my dad with a smile. "Your dad and I have the 
same banker, and he raves about your father. He's told me several times that 
your father is brilliant when it comes to making money." 
"My dad?" Mike asked again in disbelief. "Then how come we don't have a 
nice car and a nice house like the rich kids at school?" 
"A nice car and a nice house does not necessarily mean you're rich or you 
know how to make money," my dad replied. "Jimmy's dad works for the sugar 
plantation. He's not much different from me. He works for a company, and I work 
for the government. The company buys the car for him. The sugar company is in 
financial trouble, and Jimmy's dad may soon have nothing. Your dad is different 
Mike. He seems to be building an empire, and I suspect in a few years he will be 
a very rich man." 
With that, Mike and I got excited again. With new vigor, we began cleaning 
up the mess caused by our now defunct first business. As we were cleaning, we 
made plans on how and when to talk to Mike's dad. The problem was that Mike's 
dad worked long hours and often did not come home until late. His father owned 
warehouses, a construction company, a chain of stores, and three restaurants. It 
was the restaurants that kept him out late. 
Mike caught the bus home after we had finished cleaning up. He was going 
to talk to his dad when he got home that night and ask him if he would teach us 
how to become rich. Mike promised to call as soon as he had talked to his dad, 
even if it was late. 
The phone rang at 8:30 p.m. 
"OK," I said. "Next Saturday." And put the phone down. Mike's dad had 
agreed to meet with Mike and me. 
At 7:30 Saturday morning, I caught the bus to the poor side of town. 
The Lessons Begin: 
 
"I'll pay you 10 cents an hour. " 
Even by 1956 pay standards, 10 cents an hour was low. 
Michael and I met with his dad that morning at 8 o'clock. He was already 
busy and had been at work for more than an hour. His construction supervisor was 
just leaving in his pickup truck as I walked up to his simple, small and tidy 
home. Mike met me at the door. 
"Dad's on the phone, and he said to wait on the back porch," Mike said as 
he opened the door. 
The old wooden floor creaked as I steppedacross the threshold of this 
aging house. There was a cheap mat just inside the door. The mat was there to 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
hide the years of wear from countless footsteps that the floor had supported. 
Although clean, it needed to be replaced. 
I felt claustrophobic as I entered the narrow living room, which was 
filled with old musty overstuffed furniture that today would be collector's 
items. Sitting on the couch were two women, a little older than my mom. Across 
from the women sat a man in workman's clothes. He wore khaki slacks and a khaki 
shirt, neatly pressed but without starch, and polished work books. He was about 
10 years older than my dad; I'd say about 45 years old. They smiled as Mike and 
I walked past them, heading for the kitchen, which lead to the porch that 
overlooked the back yard. I smiled back shyly. 
"Who are those people?" I asked. 
"Oh, they work for my dad. The older man runs his warehouses, and the 
women are the managers of the restaurants. And you saw the construction 
supervisor, who is working on a road project about 50 miles from here. His other 
supervisor, who is building a track of houses, had already left before you got 
here." 
"Does this go on all the time?" I asked. 
"Not always, but quite often," said Mike, smiling as he pulled up a chair 
to sit down next to me. 
"I asked him if he would teach us to make money," Mike said. 
"Oh, and what did he say to that?" I asked with cautious curiosity. 
"Well, he had a funny look on his face at first, and then he said he would 
make us an offer." 
"Oh," I said, rocking my chair back against the wall; I sat there 
perched on two rear legs of the chair. 
Mike did the same thing. 
"Do you know what the offer is?" I asked. 
"No, but we'll soon find out." 
Suddenly, Mike's dad burst through the rickety screen door and onto the 
porch. Mike and I jumped to our feet, not out of respect but because we were 
startled. 
"Ready boys?" Mike's dad asked as he pulled up a chair to sit down 
with us. 
We nodded our heads as we pulled our chairs away from the wall to sit in 
front of him. 
He was a big man, about 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. My dad was taller, 
about the same weight, and five years older than Mike's dad. They sort of looked 
alike, though not of the same ethnic makeup. Maybe their energy was similar. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"Mike says you want to learn to make money? Is that correct, Robert?" 
I nodded my head quickly, but with a little intimidation. He had a lot of 
power behind his words and smile. 
"OK, here's my offer. I'll teach you, but I won't do it classroom-style. 
You work for me, I'll teach you. You don't work for me, I won't teach you. I can 
teach you faster if you work, and I'm wasting my time if you just want to sit 
and listen, like you do in school. That's my offer. Take it or leave it." 
"Ah... may I ask a question first?" I asked. 
"No. Take it or leave it. I've got too much work to do to waste my time. 
If you can't make up you mind decisively, then you'll never learn to make money 
anyway. Opportunities come and go. Being able to know when to make quick 
decisions is an important skill. You have an opportunity that you asked for. 
School is beginning or it's over in ten seconds," Mike's dad said with a teasing 
smile. 
"Take it," I said.  ` 
"Take it," said Mike. 
"Good," said Mike's dad. "Mrs. Martin will be by in ten minutes. After I'm 
through with her, you ride with her to my superette and you can begin working. 
I'll pay you 10 cents an hour and you will work for three hours every Saturday." 
"But I have a softball game today," I said. 
Mike's dad lowered his voice to a stern tone. "Take it or leave it," he 
"I'll take it," I replied, choosing to work and learn instead of playing 
softball. 
 
30 Cents Later 
 
By 9 a.m. on a beautiful Saturday morning, Mike and I were working for Mrs. 
Martin. She was a kind and patient woman. She always said that Mike and I 
reminded her of her two sons who were grown and gone. Although kind, she 
believed in hard work and she kept us working. She was a task master. We spent 
three hours taking canned goods off the shelves and, with a feather duster, 
brushing each can to get the dust off, and then re-stacking them neatly. It was 
excruciatingly boring work. 
Mike's dad, whom I call my rich dad, owned nine of these little superettes 
with large parking lots. They were the early version of the 7-11 convenience 
stores. Little neighborhood grocery stores where people bought items such as 
milk, bread, butter and cigarettes. The problem was, this was Hawaii before air 
conditioning, and the stores could not close its doors because of the heat. On 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
two sides of the store, the doors had to be wide open to the road and parking 
lot. Every time a car drove by or pulled into the parking lot, dust would swirl 
and settle in the store. 
Hence, we had a job for as long as there was no air conditioning. 
For three weeks, Mike and I reported to Mrs. Martin and worked our three 
hours. By noon, our work was over, and she dropped three little dimes in each of 
our hands. Now, even at the age of 9 in the mid-1950s, 30 cents was not too 
exciting. Comic books cost 10 cents back then, so I usually spent my money on 
comic books and went home. 
By Wednesday of the fourth week, I was ready to quit. I had agreed to work 
only because I wanted to learn to make money from Mike's dad, and now I was a 
slave for 10 cents an hour. On top of that, I had not seen Mike's dad since that 
first Saturday. 
"I'm quitting," I told Mike at lunchtime. The school lunch was miserable. 
School was boring, and now I did not even have my Saturdays to look forward to. 
But it was the 30 cents that really got to me. 
This time Mike smiled. 
"What are you laughing at?" I asked with anger and frustration. 
"Dad said this would happen. He said to meet with him when you were ready 
to quit." 
"What?" I said indignantly. "He's been waiting for me to get fed up?" 
"Sort of," Mike said. "Dad's kind of different. He teaches differently 
from your dad. Your mom and dad lecture a lot. My dad is quiet and a man of few 
words. You just wait till this Saturday. I'll tell him .you're ready." 
"You mean I've been set up?" 
"No, not really, but maybe. Dad will explain on Saturday." 
Waiting in Line on Saturday 
 
I was ready to face him and I was prepared. Even my real dad was angry 
with him. My real dad, the one I call the poor one, thought that my rich dad was 
violating child labor laws and should be investigated. 
My educated poor dad told me to demand what I deserve. At least 25 cents 
an hour. My poor dad told me that if I did not get a raise, I was to quit 
immediately. 
"You don't need that damned job anyway," said my poor dad with indignity. 
At 8 o'clock Saturday morning, I was going through the same rickety door 
of Mike's house. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"Take a seat and wait in line," Mike's dad said as I entered. He turned 
and disappeared into his little office next to a bedroom. 
I looked around the room and did not see Mike anywhere. Feeling awkward, I 
cautiously sat down next to the same two women who where there four weeks 
earlier. They smiled and slid across the couch to make room for me. 
Forty-five minutes went by, and I was steaming. The two women had met with 
him and left thirty minutes earlier. An older gentleman was in there for twenty 
minutes and was also gone. 
The house was empty, and I sat out in his musty dark living room on a 
beautiful sunny Hawaiian day, waiting to talk to a cheapskate who exploited 
children. I could hear him rustling around the office, talking on the phone, and 
ignoring me. I was now ready to walk out, but for some reason I stayed. 
Finally, fifteen minutes later, at exactly 9 o'clock, rich dad walked out 
of his office, said nothing, and signaled with his hand for me to enter his 
dingy office. 
"I understand you want a raise or you're going to quit," rich dad said as 
he swiveled in his office chair. 
"Well, you're not keeping your end of the bargain," I blurted out nearly 
in tears. It was really frightening for a 9-year-old boy to confront a grownup. 
"You said that you would teach me if I worked for you. Well, I've worked 
for you. I've worked hard. I've given up my baseball games to work for you. And 
you don't keep your word. You haven't taught me anything. You are a crook like 
everyone in town thinks you are. You're greedy. You want all the money and don't 
take care of your employees. You make me wait and don't show me any respect. I'm 
only a little boy, and I deserve to be treated better." 
Rich dad rocked back in his swivel chair, hands up to his chin, somewhat 
staring at me. It was like he was studying me. 
"Not bad," he said. "In less than a month, you sound like most of my 
employees." 
"What?" I asked. Not understanding what he was saying, I continued with my 
grievance. "I thought you were going to keep your end of the bargain and teach 
me. Instead you want to torture me? That's cruel. That's really cruel." 
"I am teaching you," rich dad said quietly. 
"What have you taught me? Nothing!" I said angrily. "You haven't even 
talked to me once since I agreed to work for peanuts. Ten cents an hour. Hah! I 
should notify the government about you. 
We have child labor laws, you know. My dad works for the government, you 
know." 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"Wow!" said rich dad. "Now you sound just like most of the people who used 
to work for me. People I've either fired or they've quit." 
"So what do you have to say?" I demanded, feeling pretty brave for a 
little kid. "You lied to me. I've worked for you, and you have not kept your 
word. You haven't taught me anything." 
"How do you know that I've not taught you anything?" asked rich dad calmly. 
"Well, you've never talked to me. I've worked for three weeks, and you 
have not taught me anything," I said with a pout. 
"Does teaching mean talking or a lecture?" rich dad asked. 
"Well, yes," I replied. 
"That's how they teach you in school," he said smiling. "But that is not 
how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best teacher of all. Most 
of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each 
push is life saying, `Wake up. There's something I want you to learn.' " 
"What is this man talking about?" I asked myself silently. "Life pushing 
me around was life talking to me?" Now I knew I had to quit my job. I was 
talking to someone who needed to be locked up. 
"If you learn life's lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just 
continue to push you around. People do two things. Some just let life push them 
around. Others get angry and push back. But they push back against their boss, 
or their job, or their husband or wife. They do not know it's life that's 
pushing." 
I had no idea what he was talking about. 
"Life pushes all of us around. Some give up. Others fight. A few learn the 
lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing them around. To these few people, 
it means they need and want to learn something. They learn and move on. Most 
quit, and a few like you fight." 
Rich dad stood and shut the creaky old wooden window that needed repair. 
"If you learn this lesson, you will grow into a wise, wealthy and happy young 
man. If you don't, you will spend your life blaming a job, low pay or your boss 
for your problems. You'll live life hoping for that big break that will solve 
all your money problems." 
Rich dad looked over at me to see if I was still listening. His eyes met 
mine. We stared at each other, streams of communication going between us through 
our eyes. Finally, I pulled away once I had absorbed his last message. I knew he 
was right. I was blaming him, and I did ask to learn. I was fighting. 
Rich dad continued. "Or if you're the kind of person who has no guts, you 
just give up every time life pushes you. If you're that kind of person, you'll 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
live all your life playing it safe, doing the right things, saving yourself for 
some event that never happens. Then, you die a boring old man. You'll have lots 
of friends who really like you because you were such a nice hard-working guy. 
You spent a life playing it safe, doing the right things. But the truth is, you 
let life push you into submission. Deep down you were terrified of taking risks. 
You really wanted to win, but the fear of losing was greater than the excitement 
of winning. Deep inside, you and only you will know you didn't go for it.  You 
chose to play it safe." 
Our eyes met again. For ten seconds, we looked at each other, only pulling 
away once the message was received. 
"You've been pushing me around" I asked. 
"Some people might say that," smiled rich dad. "I would say that I just 
gave you a taste of life." 
"What taste of life?" I asked, still angry, but now curious. Even ready to 
learn. 
"You boys are the first people that have ever asked me to teach them how 
to make money. I have more than 150 employees, and not one of them has asked me 
what I know about money. They ask me for a job and a paycheck, but never to 
teach them about money. So most will spend the best years of their lives working 
for money, not really understanding what it is they are working for." 
I sat there listening intently. 
"So when Mike told me about you wanting to learn how to make money, I 
decided to design a course that was close to real life. I could talk until I was 
blue in the face, but you wouldn't hear a thing. So I decided to let life push 
you around a bit so you could hear me. That's why I only paid you 10 cents." 
"So what is the lesson I learned from working for only 10 cents an hour?" 
I asked. "That you're cheap and exploit your workers?" 
Rich dad rocked back and laughed heartily. Finally, after his laughing 
stopped, he said, "You'd best change your point of view. Stop blaming me, 
thinking I'm the problem. If you think I'm the problem, then you have to change 
me. If you realize that you're the problem, then you can change yourself, learn 
something and grow wiser. Most people want everyone else in the world to change 
but themselves. Let me tell you, it's easier to change yourself than everyone 
else." 
"I don't understand," I said. 
"Don't blame me for your problems," rich dad said, growing impatient. 
"But you only pay me 10 cents." 
"So what are you learning?" rich dad asked, smiling. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"That you're cheap," I said with a sly grin. 
"See, you think I'm the problem," said rich dad. 
"But you are." 
"Well, keep that attitude and you learn nothing. Keep the attitude 
that I'm the problem and what choices do you have?" 
"Well, if you don't pay me more or show me more respect and teach me, I'll 
quit." 
"Well put," rich dad said. "And that's exactly what most people do. They 
quit and go looking for another job, better opportunity, and higher pay, 
actually thinking that a new job or more pay will solve the problem. In most 
cases, it won't." 
"So what will solve the problem?" I asked. "Just take this measly 10 cents 
an hour and smile?" 
Rich dad smiled. "That's what the other people do. Just accept a paycheck 
knowing that they and their family will struggle financially. But that's all 
they do, waiting for a raise thinking that more money will solve the problem. 
Most just accept it, and some take a second job working harder, but again 
accepting a small paycheck." 
I sat staring at the floor, beginning to understand the lesson rich dad 
was presenting. I could sense it was a taste of life. Finally, I looked up and 
repeated the question. "So what will solve the problem?" 
"This," he said tapping me gently on the head. "This stuff between your 
ears." 
It was at that moment that rich dad shared the pivotal point of view that 
separated him from his employees and my poor dad-and led him to eventually 
become one of the richest men in Hawaii while my highly educated, but poor, dad 
struggled financially all his life. It was a singular point of view that made 
all the difference over a lifetime. 
Rich dad said over and over, this point of view, which I call Lesson No. 1. 
 
"The poor and the middle class work for money." "The rich have money work 
for them." 
 
On that bright Saturday morning, I was learning a completely different 
point of view from what I had been taught by my poor dad. At the age of 9, I 
grew aware that both dads wanted me to learn. Both dads encouraged me to study... 
but not the same things. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
My highly educated dad recommended that I do what he did. "Son, I want you 
to study hard, get good grades, so you can find a safe, secure job with a big 
company. And make sure it has excellent benefits." My rich dad wanted me to 
learn how money works so I could make it work for me. These lessons I would 
learn through life with his guidance, not because of a classroom. 
My rich dad continued my first lesson, "I'm glad you got angry about 
working for 10 cents an hour. If you had not gotten angry and had gladly 
accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could not teach you. You see, true 
learning takes energy, passion, a burning desire. Anger is a big part of that 
formula, for passion is anger and love combined. When it comes to money, most 
people want to play it safe and feel secure. So passion does not direct them: 
Fear does." 
"So is that why they'll take a job with low par?" I asked. 
"Yes," said rich dad. "Some people say I exploit people because I don't 
pay as much as the sugar plantation or the government. I say the people exploit 
themselves. It's their fear, not mine." 
"But don't you feel you should pay them more?" I asked. 
"I don't have to. And besides, more money will not solve the problem. Just 
look at your dad. He makes a lot of money, and he still can't pay his bills. 
Most people, given more money, only get into more debt." 
"So that's why the 10 cents an hour," I said, smiling. "It's a part of the 
lesson." 
"That's right," smiled rich dad. "You see, your dad went to school and got 
an excellent education, so he could get a high-paying job. Which he did. But he 
still has money problems because he never learned anything about money at school. 
On top of that, he believes in working for money." 
"And you don't?" I asked. 
"No, not really," said rich dad. "If you want to learn to work for money, 
then stay in school. That is a great place to learn to do that. But if you want 
to learn how to have money work for you, then I will teach you that. But only if 
you want to learn." 
"Wouldn't everyone want to learn that" I asked. 
"No," said rich dad. "Simply because it's easier to learn to work for 
money, especially if fear is your primary emotion when the subject of money is 
discussed." 
"I don't understand," I said with a frown. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"Don't worry about that for now. Just know that it's fear that keeps most 
people working at a job. The fear of not paying their bills. The fear of being 
fired. The fear of not having enough money. The fear of 
starting over. That's the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, 
and then working for money. Most people become a slave to money... and then get 
angry at their boss." 
"Learning to have money work for you is a completely different course of 
study?" I asked. 
"Absolutely," rich dad answered, "absolutely." 
We sat in silence on that beautiful Hawaiian Saturday morning. My friends 
would have just been starting their Little League baseball game. But far some 
reason, I was now thankful I had decided to work for 10 cents an hour. I sensed 
that I was about to learn something my friends would not learn in school. 
"Ready to learn?" asked rich dad. 
"Absolutely," I said with a grin. 
"I have kept my promise. I've been teaching you from afar," my rich dad 
said. "At 9 years old, you've gotten a taste of what it feels like to work for 
money. Just multiply your last month by fifty years and you will have an idea of 
what most people spend their life doing." 
"I don't understand," I said. 
"How did you feel waiting in line to see me? Once to get hired and once to 
ask for more money?" 
"Terrible," I said. 
"If you choose to work for money, that is what life is like for many 
people," said rich dad. 
"And how did you feel when Mrs. Martin dropped three dimes in your hand 
for three hours' work?" 
"I felt like it wasn't enough. It seemed like nothing. I was 
disappointed," I said. 
"And that is how most employees feel when they look at their paychecks. 
Especially after all the tax and other deductions are taken out. At least you 
got 100 percent." 
"You mean most workers don't get paid everything?" I asked with amazement. 
"Heavens no!" said rich dad. "The government always takes its share 
first." 
"How do they do that." I asked. 
"Taxes," said rich dad. "You're taxed when you earn. You're taxed when you 
spend. You're taxed when you save. You're taxed when you die." 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"Why do people let the government do that to them?" 
"The rich don't," said rich dad with a smile. "The poor and the middle 
class do. I'll bet you that I earn more than your dad, yet he pays more in 
taxes." 
"How can that be?" I asked. As a 9-year-old boy, that made no sense to me. 
"Why would someone let the government do that to them?" 
Rich dad sat there in silence. I guess he wanted me to listen instead of 
jabber away at the mouth. 
Finally, I calmed down. I did not like what I had heard. I knew my dad 
complained constantly about paying so much in taxes, but really did nothing 
about it. Was that life pushing him around? 
Rich dad rocked slowly and silently in his chair, just looking at me. 
"Ready to learn?" he asked. 
I nodded my head slowly. 
"As I said, there is a lot to learn. Learning how to have money work for 
you is a lifetime study. Most people go to college for four years, and their 
education ends. I already know that my study of money will continue over my 
lifetime, simply because the more I Find out, the more I find out I need to know. 
Most people never study the subject. They go to work, get their paycheck, 
balance their checkbooks, and that's it. On top of that, they wonder why they 
have money problems. Then, they think that more money will solve the problem. 
Few realize that it's their lack of financial education that is the problem." 
"So my dad has tax problems because he doesn't understand money?" I asked, 
confused. 
"Look," said rich dad. "Taxes are just one small section on learning how 
to have money work for you. Today, I just wanted to find out if you still have 
the passion to learn about money. Most people don't. They want to go to school, 
learn a profession, have fun at their work, and earn lots of money. One day they 
wake up with big money problems, and then they can't stop working. That's the 
price of only knowing how to work for money instead of studying how to have 
money work for you. So do you still have the passion to learn?" asked rich dad. 
I nodded my head. 
"Good," said rich dad. "Now get back to work. This time, I will pay you 
nothing." 
"What?" I asked in amazement. 
"You heard me. Nothing. You will work the same three hours every 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Saturday, but this time you will not be paid 10 cents per hour. You said 
you wanted to learn to not work for money, so I'm not going to pay you 
anything." 
I couldn't believe what I was hearing. 
"I've already had this conversation with Mike. He's already working, 
dusting and stacking canned goods for free. You'd better hurry and get back 
there." 
"That's not fair," I shouted. "You've got to pay something." 
"You said you wanted to learn. If you don't learn this now, you'll grow up 
to be like the two women and the older man sitting in my living room, working 
for money and hoping I don't fire them. Or like your dad, earning lots of money 
only to be in debt up to his eyeballs, hoping more money will solve the problem. 
If that's what you want, I'll go back to our original deal of 10 cents an hour. 
Or you can do what most people grow up to do. Complain that there is not enough 
pay, quit and go looking for another job." 
"But what do I do?" I asked. 
Rich dad tapped me on the head. "Use this," he said. "If you use it well, 
you will soon thank me for giving you an opportunity, and you will grow into a 
rich man." 
I stood there still not believing what a raw deal I had been handed. Here 
I came to ask for a raise, and now I was being told to keep working for nothing. 
Rich dad tapped me on the head again and said, "Use this. Now get out of 
here and get back to work." 
LESSON #l: The Rich Don't Work For Money 
 
I didn't tell my poor dad I wasn't being paid. He would not have 
understood, and I did not want to try to explain something that I did not yet 
understand myself. 
For three more weeks, Mike and I worked for three hours, every Saturday, 
for nothing. The work didn't bother me, and the routine got easier. It was the 
missed baseball games and not being able to afford to buy a few comic books that 
got to me. 
Rich dad stopped by at noon on the third week. We heard his truck pull up 
in the parking lot and sputter when the engine was turned off. He entered the 
store and greeted Mrs. Martin with a hug. After finding out how things were 
going in the store, he reached into the ice-cream freezer, pulled out two bars, 
paid for them, and signalled to Mike and me. 
"Let's go for a walk boys." 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
We crossed the street, dodging a few cars, and walked across a large 
grassy field, where a few adults were playing softball. Sitting down at a remote 
picnic table, he handed Mike and me the ice-cream bars. 
"How's it going boys?" 
"OK," Mike said. 
I nodded in agreement. 
"Learn anything yet?" rich dad asked. 
Mike and I looked at each other, shrugged our shoulders and shook our 
heads in unison. 
 
Avoiding One of Life's Biggest Traps 
 
"Well, you boys had better start thinking. You're staring at one of life's 
biggest lessons. If you learn the lesson, you'll enjoy a life of great freedom 
and security. If you don't learn the lesson, you'll wind up like Mrs. Martin and 
most of the people playing softball in this park. They work very hard, for 
little money, clinging to the illusion of job security, looking forward to a 
three-week vacation each year and a skimpy pension after forty-five years of 
work. If that excites you, I'll give you a raise to 25 cents an hour." 
"But these are good hard-working people. Are you making fun of them?" I 
demanded. 
A smile came over rich dad's face. 
"Mrs. Martin is like a mother to me. I would never be that cruel. I may 
sound cruel because I'm doing my best to point something out to the two of you. 
I want to expand your point of view so you can see something. Something most 
people never have the benefit of seeing because their vision is too narrow. Most 
people never see the trap they are in." 
Mike and I sat there uncertain of his message. He sounded cruel, yet we 
could sense he was desperately wanting us to know something. 
With a smile, rich dad said, "Doesn't that 25 cents an hour sound good? 
Doesn't it make your heart beat a little faster." 
I shook my head "no," but it really did. Twenty five cents an hour would 
be big bucks to me. 
"OK, I'll pay you a dollar an hour," rich dad said, with a sly grin. 
Now my heart was beginning to race. My brain was screaming, 
An 
"Take it. Take it." I could not believe what I was hearing. Still, I said 
nothing. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"OK, $2 an hour." 
My little 9-year-old brain and heart nearly exploded. After all, it was 
1956 and being paid $2 an hour would have made me the richest kid in the world. 
I couldn't imagine earning that kind of money. I wanted to say "yes." I wanted 
the deal. I could see a new bicycle, new baseball glove, and adoration of my 
friends when I flashed some cash. On top of that, Jimmy and his rich friends 
could never call me poor again. But somehow my mouth stayed silent. 
Maybe my brain had overheated and blown a fuse. But deep down, I badly 
wanted that $2 an hour. 
The ice cream had melted and was running down my hand. The ice-cream stick 
was empty, and under it was a sticky mess of vanilla and chocolate that ants 
were enjoying. Rich dad was looking at two boys staring back at him, eyes wide 
open and brains empty. He knew he was testing us, and he knew there was a part 
of our emotions that wanted to take the deal. He knew that each human being has 
a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought. And he knew that each 
human being also had a part of their soul that was strong and filled with a 
resolve that could never be bought. It was only a question of which one was 
stronger. He had tested thousands of souls in his life. He tested souls every 
time he interviewed someone for a job. 
"OK, $5 an hour." 
Suddenly there was a silence from inside me. Something had changed. The 
offer was too big and had gotten ridiculous. Not too many grownups in 1956 made 
more than $5 an hour. The temptation disappeared, and a calm set in. Slowly I 
turned to my left to look at Mike. He looked back at me. The part of my soul 
that was weak and needy was silenced. The part of me that had no price took over. 
There was a calm and a certainty about money that entered my brain and my soul. 
I knew Mike had gotten to that point also. 
"Good," rich dad said softly. "Most people have a price. And they have a 
price because of human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being 
without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, 
greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. 
The pattern is then set." 
"What pattern?" I asked. 
"The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills, get up, go to work, pay 
bills... Their lives are then run forever by two emotions, fear and greed. Offer 
them more money, and they continue the cycle by also increasing their spending. 
This is what I call the Rat Race." 
"There is another way?" Mike asked. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"Yes," said rich dad slowly. "But only a few people find it." 
"And what is that way?" Mike asked. 
"That's what I hope you boys will find out as you work and study with me. 
That is why I took away all forms of pay." 
"Any hints?" Mike asked. "We're kind of tired of working hard, especially 
for nothing." 
"Well, the first step is telling the truth," said rich dad. 
"We haven't been lying." I said. 
"I did not say you were lying. I said to tell the truth," rich dad came 
back. 
"The truth about what?" I asked. 
"How you're feeling," rich dad said. "You don't have to say it to anyone 
else. Just yourself." 
"You mean the people in this park, the people who work for you, Mrs. 
Martin, they don't do that?" I asked. 
"I doubt it," said rich dad. "Instead, they feel the fear of not having 
money. Instead of confronting the fear, they react instead of think. They react 
emotionally instead of using their heads," rich dad said, tapping us on our 
heads. "'Then, they get a few bucks in their hands, and again the emotion of joy 
and desire and greed take over, and again they react, instead of think." 
"So their emotions do their thinking," Mike said. 
"That's correct," said rich dad. "Instead of telling the truth about how 
they feel, they react to their feeling, fail to think. They feel the fear, they 
go to work, hoping that money will soothe the fear, but it doesn't. That old 
fear haunts them, and they go back to work, hoping again that money will calm 
their fears, and again it doesn't. Fear has them in this trap of working, 
earning money, working, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every 
day they get up, and that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of people, 
that old fear keeps them awake all night, causing a night of turmoil and worry. 
So they get up and go to work, hoping that a paycheck will kill that fear 
gnawing at their soul. Money is running their lives, and they refuse to tell the 
truth about that. 
Money is in control of their emotions and hence their souls." 
Rich dad sat quietly, letting his words sink in. Mike and I heard what he 
said, but really did not understand fully what he was talking about. I just knew 
that I often wondered why grownups hurried off to work. It did not seem like 
much fun, and they never looked that happy, but something kept them hurrying off 
to work. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Realizing we had absorbed as much as possible of what he was talking about, 
rich dad said, "I want you boys to avoid that trap. That is really what I want 
to teach you. Not just to be rich, because being rich does not solve the 
problem." 
"It doesn't?" I asked, surprised. 
"No, it doesn't. Let me finish the other emotion, which is desire. Some 
call it greed, but I prefer desire. It is perfectly normal to desire something 
better, prettier, more fun or exciting. So people also work for money because of 
desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that 
money brings is often short lived, and they soon need more money for more joy, 
more pleasure, more comfort, more security. So they keep working, thinking money 
will soothe their souls that is troubled by fear and desire. But money cannot do 
that." 
"Even rich people?" Mike asked. 
"Rich people included," said rich dad. "In fact, the reason many rich 
people are rich is not because of desire but because of fear. They actually 
think that money can eliminate that fear of not having money, of being poor, so 
they amass tons of it only tofind out the fear gets worse. They now fear losing 
it. I have friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know people 
who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. They're 
terrified of losing all their money. The fears that drove them to get rich got 
worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming louder. They 
don't want to lose the big houses, the cars, the high life that money has bought 
them. They worry about what their friends would say if they lost all their money. 
Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, although they look rich and have 
more money." 
"So is a poor man happier?" I asked. 
"No, I don't think so," replied rich dad. "The avoidance of money is just 
as psychotic as being attached to money." 
As if on cue, the town derelict went past our table, stopping by the large 
rubbish can and rummaging around in it. The three of us watched him with great 
interest, when before we probably would have just ignored him. 
Rich dad pulled a dollar out of his wallet and gestured to the older man. 
Seeing the money, the derelict came over immediately, took the bill, thanked 
rich dad profusely and hurried off ecstatic with his good fortune. 
"He's not much different from most of my employees," said rich dad. "I've 
met so many people who say, `Oh, I'm not interested in money.' Yet they'll work 
at a job for eight hours a day. That's a denial of truth. If they weren't 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
interested in money, then why are they working? That kind of thinking is 
probably more psychotic than a person who hoards money." 
As I sat there listening to my rich dad, my mind was flashing back to the 
countless times my own dad said, "I'm not interested in money." He said those 
words often. He also covered himself by always saying, "I work because I love my 
job." 
"So what do we do?" I asked. "Not work for money until all traces of fear 
and greed are gone?" 
"No, that would be a waste of time," said rich dad. "Emotions are what 
make us human. Make us real. The word `emotion' stands for energy in motion. Be 
truthful about your emotions, and use your mind and emotions in your favor, not 
against yourself." 
"Whoa!" said Mike. 
"Don't worry about what I just said. It will make more sense in years to 
come. just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions. Most people do not 
know that it's their emotions that are doing the thinking. Your emotions are 
your emotions, but you have got to learn to do your own thinking." 
"Can you give me an example?" I asked. 
"Sure," replied rich dad. "When a person says, `I need to find a job,' 
it's most likely an emotion doing the thinking. Fear of not having money 
generates that thought." 
"But people do need money if they have bills to pay," I said. 
"Sure they do," smiled rich dad. "All I'm saying is that it's fear that is 
all too often doing the thinking." 
"I don't understand," said Mike. 
"For example," said rich dad. "If the fear of not having enough money 
arises, instead of immediately running out to get a job so they can earn a few 
bucks to kill the fear, they instead might ask themselves this question. `Will a 
job be the best solution to this fear over the long run?' In my opinion, the 
answer is `no.' Especially when you look over a person's lifetime. A job is 
really a short-term solution to a long-term problem." 
"But my dad is always saying, `Stay in school, get good grades, so you can 
find a safe, secure job.' I spoke out, somewhat confused. 
"Yes, I understand he says that," said rich dad, smiling. "Most people 
recommend that, and it's a good idea for most people. But people make that 
recommendation primarily out of fear." 
"You mean my dad says that because he's afraid?" 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"Yes," said rich dad. "He's terrified that you won't be able to earn money 
and won't fit into society. Don't get me wrong. He loves you and wants the best 
for you. And I think his fear is justified. An education and a job are important. 
But it won't handle the fear. You see, that same fear that makes him get up in 
the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that is causing him to be so 
fanatical about you going to school." 
"So what do you recommend?" I asked. 
"I want to teach you to master the power of money. Not be afraid of it. 
And they don't teach that in school. If you don't learn it, you become a slave 
to money." 
It was finally making sense. He did want us to widen our views. To . see 
what Mrs. Martin could not see, his employees could not see, or my dad for that 
matter. He used examples that sounded cruel at the time, but I've never 
forgotten them. My vision widened that day, and I could begin to see the trap 
that lay ahead for most people. 
"You see, we're all employees ultimately. We just work at different 
levels," said rich dad. "I just want you boys to have a chance to avoid the trap. 
The trap caused by those two emotions, fear and desire. Use them in your favor, 
not against you. That's what I want to teach you. I'm not interested in just 
teaching you to make a pile of money. That won't handle the fear or desire. If 
you don't first handle fear and desire, and you get rich, you'll only be a high-
paid slave." 
"So how do we avoid the trap?" I asked. 
"The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, 
not the economy or the government or the rich. It's selfinflicted fear and 
ignorance that keeps people trapped. So you boys go to school and get your 
college degrees. I'll teach you how to stay out of the trap." 
The pieces of the puzzle were appearing. My highly educated dad had a 
great education and a great career. But school never told him how to handle 
money or his fears. It became clear that I could learn different and important 
things from two fathers. 
"So you've been talking about the fear of not having money. How does the 
desire of money affect our thinking?" Mike asked. 
"How did you feel when I tempted you with a pay raise? Did you notice your 
desires rising?" 
We nodded our heads. 
"By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay your reactions 
and think. That is most important. We will always have emotions of fear and 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
greed. From here on in, it is most important for you to use those emotions to 
your advantage and for the long term, and not simply let your emotions run you 
by controlling your thinking. Most people use fear and greed against themselves. 
That's the start of ignorance. Most people live their lives chasing paychecks, 
pay raises and job security because of the emotions of desire and fear, not 
really questioning where those emotion-driven thoughts are leading them. It's 
just like the picture of a donkey, dragging a cart, with its owner dangling a 
carrot just in front of the donkey's nose. The donkey's owner may be going where 
he wants to go, but the donkey is chasing an illusion. Tomorrow there will only 
be another carrot for the donkey." 
"You mean the moment I began to picture a new baseball glove, candy and 
toys, that's like a carrot to a donkey?" Mike asked. 
"Yeah. And as you get older, your toys get more expensive. A new car, a 
boat and a big house to impress your friends," said rich dad with a smile. "Fear 
pushes you out the door, and desire calls to you. Enticing you toward the rocks. 
That's the trap." 
"So what's the answer," Mike asked. 
"What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. That is why rich people 
with lots of money often have more fear the richer they get. Money is the carrot, 
the illusion. If the donkey could see the whole picture, it might rethink its 
choice to chase the carrot." 
Rich dad went on to explain that a human's life is a struggle between 
ignorance and illumination. 
He explained that once a person stops searching for information and 
knowledge of one's self, ignorance sets in. That struggle is a moment-to-moment 
decision-to learn to open or close one's mind. 
"Look, school is very, very important. You go to school to learn a skill 
or profession so as to be a contributing member of society. Every culture needs 
teachers, doctors, mechanics, artists, cooks, business people, police officers, 
firefighters, soldiers. Schools train them so our culture can thrive and 
flourish," said rich dad. "Unfortunately, for many people, school is the end, 
not the beginning." 
There was a long silence. Rich dad was smiling. I did not comprehend 
everything he said that day. But as with most great teachers, whose words 
continue to teach for years, often long after they're gone, his words are still 
with me today. 
"I've been a little cruel today," said rich dad. "Cruel for a reason. I 
want you to always remember this talk. I want you to always think of Mrs. Martin. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
I want you always to think of the donkey. Never forget, because your two 
emotions, fear and desire, can lead you into life's biggest trap, if you're not 
aware of them controlling your thinking. To spend your life living in fear, 
never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for money, thinking that 
money will buy you things that will make you happy is also cruel. To wake up in 
the middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live. 
To live a life dictated by the size of a paycheck is not really a life. Thinking 
that a job will make you feel secure is lying to yourself. That's cruel, and 
that's the trap I want you to avoid, if possible. I've seen how money runs 
people's lives. Don't let that happen to you. Please don't let money run your 
life." 
A softball rolled under our table. Rich dad picked it up and threw it back. 
"So what does ignorance have to do with greed and fear?" I asked. 
"Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed and so much 
fear," said rich dad. "Let me give you some examples. A doctor, wanting more 
money to better provide for his family, raises his fees. By raising his fees, it 
makes health care more expensive for everyone. Now, it hurts the poor people the 
most, so poor people have worse health than those with money. 
"Because the doctors raise their rates, the attorneys raise their rates. 
Because the attorneys' rates have gone up, schoolteachers want a raise, which 
raises our taxes, and on and on and on. Soon, there will be such a horrifying 
gap between the rich and the poor that chaos will break out and another great 
civilization will collapse. Great civilizations collapsed when the gap between 
the haves and havenots was too great. America is on the same course, proving 
once again that history repeats itself, because we do not learn from history. We 
only memorize historical dates and names, not the lesson. 
"Aren't prices supposed to go up?" I asked. 
"Not in an educated society with a well-run government. Prices should 
actually come down. Of course, that is often only true in theory. Prices go up 
because of greed and fear caused by ignorance. If schools taught people about 
money, there would be more money and lower prices, but schools focus only on 
teaching people to work for money, not how to harness money's power." 
"But don't we have business schools?" Mike asked. "Aren't you encouraging 
me to go to business school for my master's degree?" 
"Yes," said rich dad. "But all too often, business schools train employees 
who are sophisticated bean counters. Heaven forbid a bean counter takes over a 
business. All they do is look at the numbers, fire people and kill the business. 
I know because I hire bean counters. All they think about is cutting costs and 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
raising prices, which cause more problems. Bean counting is important. I wish 
more people knew it, but it, too, is not the whole picture," added rich dad 
angrily. 
"So is there an answer?" asked Mike. 
"Yes," said rich dad. "Learn to use your emotions to think, not think with 
your emotions. When you boys mastered your emotions, first by agreeing to work 
for free, I knew there was hope. When you again resisted your emotions when I 
tempted you with more money, you were again learning to think in spite of being 
emotionally charged. That's the first step." 
"Why is that step so important" I asked. 
"Well, that's up to you to find out. If you want to learn, I'll take you 
boys into the briar patch. That place where almost everyone else avoids. I'll 
take you to that place where most people are afraid to go. If you go with me, 
you'll let go of the idea of working for money and instead learn to have money 
work for you." 
"And what will we get if we go with you. What if we agree to learn from 
you? What will we get?" I asked. 
"The same thing Briar Rabbit got," said rich dad. "Freedom from the Tar 
Baby." 
"Is there a briar patch?" I asked. 
"Yes," said rich dad. "The briar patch is our fear and our greed. Going 
into our fear and confronting our greed, our weaknesses, our neediness is the 
way out. And the way out is through the mind, by choosing our thoughts." 
"Choosing our thoughts?" Mike asked, puzzled. 
"Yes. Choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions. Instead 
of just getting up and going to work to solve your problems, just because the 
fear of not having the money to pay your bills is scaring you. Thinking would be 
taking the time to ask yourself a question. A question like, `Is working harder 
at this the best solution to this problem?' Most people are so terrified at not 
telling themselves the truth-that fear is in control-that they cannot think, and 
instead run out the door. Tar baby is in control. That's what I mean by choosing 
your thoughts." 
"And how do we do that?" Mike asked. 
"That's what I will be teaching you. I'll be teaching you to have a choice 
of thoughts to consider, rather than knee-jerk reacting, like gulping down your 
morning coffee and running out the door. 
"Remember what I said before: A job is only a short-term solution to a 
long-term problem. Most people have only one problem in mind, and it's short 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
term. It's the bills at the end of the month, the Tar Baby. Money now runs their 
lives. Or should I say the fear and ignorance about money. So they do as their 
parents did, get up every day and go work for money. Not having the time to say, 
`Is there another way?' Their emotions now control their thinking, not their 
heads." 
"Can you tell the difference between emotions thinking and the head 
thinking?" Mike asked. 
"Oh, yes. I hear it all the time," said rich dad. "I hear things like, 
`Well, everyone has to work.' Or `The rich are crooks.' Or `I'll get another job. 
I deserve this raise. You can't push me around.' Or `I like this job because 
it's secure.' Instead of, `Is there something I'm missing here?' which breaks 
the emotional thought, and gives you time to think clearly." 
I must admit, it was a great lesson to be getting. To know when someone 
was speaking out of emotions or out of clear thought. It was a lesson that 
served me well for life. Especially when I was the one speaking out of reaction 
and not from clear thought. 
As we headed back to the store, rich dad explained that the rich really 
did "make money." They did not work for it. He went on to explain that when Mike 
and I were casting 5-cent pieces out of lead, thinking we were making money, we 
were very close to thinking the way the rich think. The problem was that it was 
illegal for us to do it. It was legal for the government and banks to do it, but 
not us. He explained that there are legal ways to make money and illegal ways. 
Rich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an illusion, 
truly like the carrot for the donkey. It's only out of fear and greed that the 
illusion of money is held together by billions of people thinking that money is 
real. Money is really made up. It was only because of the illusion of confidence 
and the ignorance of the masses that the house of cards stood standing. "In 
fact," he said, "in many ways the donkey's carrot was more valuable than money." 
He talked about the gold standard that America was on, and that each 
dollar bill was actually a silver certificate. What concerned him was the rumor 
that we would someday go off the gold standard and our dollars would no longer 
be silver certificates. 
"When that happens, boys, all hell is going to break loose. The poor, the 
middle class and the ignorant will have their lives ruined simply because they 
will continue to believe that money is real and that the company they work for, 
or the government, will look after them." 
We really did not understand what he was saying that day, but over the 
years it made more and more sense. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Seeing What Others Miss 
 
As he climbed into his pickup truck, outside of his little convenience 
store, he said, "Keep working boys, but the sooner you forget about needing a 
paycheck, the easier your adult life will be. Keep using your brain, work for 
free, and soon your mind will show you ways of making money far beyond what I 
could ever pay you. You will see things that other people never see. 
Opportunities right in front of their noses. Most people never see these 
opportunities because they're looking for money and security, so that's all they 
get. The moment you see one opportunity, you will see them for the rest of your 
life. The moment you do that, I'll teach you something else. Learn this, and 
you'll avoid one of life's biggest traps. You'll never, ever, touch that Tar 
Baby." 
Mike and I picked up our things from the store and waved goodbye to Mrs. 
Martin. We went back to the park, to the same picnic bench, and spent several 
more hours thinking and talking. 
We spent the next week at school, thinking and talking. For two more weeks, 
we kept thinking, talking, and working for free. 
At the end of the second Saturday, I was again saying goodbye to Mrs. 
Martin and looking at the comic-book stand with a longing gaze. The hard thing 
about not even getting 30 cents every Saturday was that I didn't have any money 
to buy comic books. Suddenly, as Mrs. Martin was saying goodbye to Mike and me, 
I saw something she was doing that I had never seen her do before. I mean, I had 
seen her do it, but I never took notice of it. 
Mrs. Martin was cutting the front page of the comic book in half. She was 
keeping the top half of the comic book cover and throwing the rest of the comic 
book into a large brown cardboard box. When I asked her what she did with the 
comic books, she said, "I throw them away. I give the top half of the cover back 
to the comic-book distributor for credit when he brings in the new comics. He's 
coming in an hour." 
Mike and I waited for an hour. Soon the distributor arrived and I asked 
him if we could have the comic books. To which he replied, "You can have them if 
you work for this store and do not resell them." 
Our partnership was revived. Mike's mom had a spare room in the basement 
that no one used. We cleaned it out, and began piling hundreds of comic books in 
that room. Soon our comic-book library was open to the public. We hired Mike's 
younger sister, who loved to study, to be head librarian. She charged each child 
10 cents admission to the library, which was open from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. every 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
day after school. The customers, the children of the neighborhood, could read as 
many comics as they could in two hours. It was a bargain for them since a comic 
costs 10 cents each, and they could read five or six in two hours. 
Mike's sister would check the kids as they left, to make sure they weren't 
borrowing any comic books. She also kept the books, logging in how many kids 
showed up each day, who they were, and any comments they might have. Mike and I 
averaged $9.50 per week over a threemonth period. We paid his sister $1 a week 
and allowed her to read the comics for free, which she rarely did since she was 
always studying. 
Mike and F kept our agreement by working in the store every Saturday and 
collecting all the comic books from the different stores. We kept our agreement 
to the distributor by not selling any comic books. We burned them once they got 
too tattered. We tried opening a branch office, but we could never quite find 
someone as dedicated as Mike's sister we could trust. 
At an early age, we found out how hard it was to find good staff. 
Three months after the library first opened, a fight broke out in the room. 
Some bullies from another neighborhood pushed their way in and started it. 
Mike's dad suggested we shut down the business. So our comic-book business shut 
down, and we stopped working on Saturdays at the convenience store. Anyway, rich 
dad was excited because he had new things he wanted to teach us. He was happy 
because we had learned our first lesson so well. We had learned to have money 
work for us. By not getting paid for our work at the store, we were forced to 
use our imaginations to identify an opportunity to make money. By starting our 
own business, the comic-book library, we were in control of our own finances, 
not dependent on an employer. The best part was that our business generated 
money for us, even when we weren't physically there. Our money worked for us. 
Instead of paying us money, rich dad had given us so much more. 
 
3. CHAPTER THREE  
Lesson Two:Why Teach Financial Literacy? 
 
In 1990, my best friend, Mike, took over his father's empire and is, in 
fact, doing a better job than his dad did. We see each other once or twice a 
year on the golf course. He and his wife are wealthier than you could imagine. 
Rich dad's empire is in great hands, and Mike is now grooming his son to take 
his place, as his dad had groomed us. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
In 1994, I retired at the age of 47, and my wife, Kim, was 37. Retirement 
does not mean not working. To my wife and me, it means that barring unforeseen 
cataclysmic changes, we can work or not work, and our wealth grows automatically, 
staying way ahead of inflation. I guess it means freedom. The assets are large 
enough to grow by themselves. It's like planting a tree. You water it for years 
and then one day it doesn't need you anymore. It's roots have gone down deep 
enough. Then, the tree provides shade for your enjoyment. 
Mike chose to run the empire and I chose to retire. 
Whenever I speak to groups of people, they often ask what I would 
recommend or what could they do? "How do they get started?" "Is there a good 
book I would recommend?" "What should they do to prepare their children?" "What 
is the secret to success?" "How do I make millions?" I am always reminded of 
this article I was once given. It goes as follows. 
 
THE RICHEST BUSINESSMEN 
 
In 1923 a group of our greatest leaders and richest businessmen held a 
meeting at the Edgewater Beach hotel in Chicago. Among them were Charles Schwab, 
head of the largest independent steel company; Samuel Instill, president of the 
world's largest utility; Howard Hopson, head of the largest gas company; Ivar 
Kreuger president of the International Match Co., one of the world's largest 
companies at that time; Leon Frazier, president of the Bank of International 
Settlements; Richard Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange; Arthur 
Cotton and Jesse Livermore, two of the biggest stock speculators; and Albert 
Fall, a member of President Harding's cabinet. Twenty five years later nine of 
them (those listed above) ended as follows. Schwab died penniless after living 
for five years on borrowed money. Instill died broke living in a foreign land. 
Kreuger and Cotton also died broke. Hopson went insane. Whitney and Albert Fall 
were just released from prison. Fraser and Livermore committed suicide. 
 
I doubt if anyone can say what really happened to these men. If you look 
at the date, 1923, it was just before the 1929 market crash and the Great 
Depression, which I suspect had a great impact on these men and their lives. The 
point is this: Today we live in times of greater and faster change than these 
men did. I suspect there will be many booms and busts in the next 25 years that 
will parallel the ups and downs these men faced. I am concerned that too many 
people are focused too much on money and not their greatest wealth, which is 
their education. If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
learn, they will grow richer and richer through the changes. If they think money 
will solve problems, I am afraid those people will have a rough ride. 
Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without financial 
intelligence is money soon gone. 
 
Most people fail to realize that in life, it's not how much money you make, 
it's how much money you keep. We have all heard stories of lottery winners who 
are poor, then suddenly rich, then poor again. They win millions and are soon 
back to where they started. Or stories of professional athletes, who, at the age 
of 24, are earning millions of dollars a year, and are sleeping under a bridge 
by age 34. In the paper this morning, as I write this, there is a story of a 
young basketball player who a year ago had millions. Today, he claims his 
friends, attorney and accountant took his money, and now he works at a car wash 
for minimum wage. 
 
He is only 29. He was fired from the car wash because he refused to take 
off his championship ring as he was wiping off the cars, so his story made the 
newspaper. He is appealing his termination, claiming hardship and discrimination 
and that the ring is all he has left. He claims that if you take that away, 
he'll crumble. 
 
In 1997, I know so many people who are becoming instant millionaires. It's 
the Roaring '20s one more time. And while I am glad people have been getting 
richer and richer, I only caution that in the long run, it's not how much you 
make, it's how much you keep, and how many generations you keep it. 
 
So when people ask, "Where do I get started?" or "Tell me how to get rich 
quick," they often are greatly disappointed with my answer. I simply say to them 
what my rich dad said back to me when I was a little kid. "If you want to be 
rich, you need to be financially literate." 
 
That idea was drummed into my head every time we were together. As I said, 
my educated dad stressed the importance of reading books, while my rich dad 
stressed the need to master financial literacy. 
 
If you are going to build the Empire State Building, the first thing you 
need to do is dig a deep hole and pour a strong foundation. If you are going to 
build a home in the suburbs, all you need to do is pour a 6-inch slab of 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
concrete. Most people, in their drive to get rich, are trying to build an Empire 
State Building on a 6-inch slab. 
 
Our school system, having been created in the Agrarian Age, still believes 
in homes with no foundation. Dirt floors are still the rage. So kids graduate 
from school with virtually no financial foundation. One day, sleepless and deep 
in debt in suburbia, living the American Dream, they decide that the answer to 
their financial problems is to find a way to get rich quick. 
 
Construction on the skyscraper begins. It goes up quickly, and soon, 
instead of the Empire State Building, we have the Leaning Tower of Suburbia. The 
sleepless nights return. 
 
As for Mike and me in our adult years, both of our choices were possible 
because we were taught to pour a strong financial foundation when we were just 
kids. 
 
Now, accounting is possibly the most boring subject in the world. It also 
could be the most confusing. But if you want to be rich, long term, it could be 
the most important subject. The question is, how do you take a boring and 
confusing subject and teach it to kids? The answer is, make it simple. Teach it 
first in pictures. 
My rich dad poured a strong financial foundation for Mike and me. Since we 
were just kids, he created a simple way to teach us. For years he only drew 
pictures and used words. Mike and I understood the simple drawings, the jargon, 
the movement of money, and then in later years, rich dad began adding numbers. 
Today, Mike has gone on to master much more complex and sophisticated accounting 
analysis because he has had to. He has a billion-dollar empire to run. I am not 
as sophisticated because my empire is smaller, yet we come from the same simple 
foundation. In the following pages, I offer to you the same simple line drawings 
Mike's dad created for us. Though simple, those drawings helped guide two little 
boys in building great sums of wealth on a solid and deep foundation. 
Rule One. You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, 
and buy assets. If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know. It is Rule 
No. 1. It is the only rule. This may sound absurdly simple, but most people have 
no idea how profound this rule is. Most people struggle financially because they 
do not know the difference between an asset and a liability. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities, 
but they think they are assets" 
When rich dad explained this to Mike and me, we thought he was kidding. 
Here we were, nearly teenagers and waiting for the secret to getting rich, and 
this was his answer. It was so simple that we had to stop for a long time to 
think about it. 
"What is an asset?" asked Mike. 
"Don't worry right now," said rich dad. "Just let the idea sink in. If you 
can comprehend the simplicity, your life will have a plan and be financially 
easy. It is simple; that is why the idea is missed." 
"You mean all we need to know is what an asset is, acquire them and we'll 
be rich?" I asked. 
Rich dad nodded his head. "It's that simple." 
"If it's that simple, how come everyone is not rich?" I asked. 
Rich dad smiled. "Because people do not know the difference 
between an asset and a liability." 
I remember asking, "How could adults be so silly. If it is that simple, if 
it is that important, why would everyone not want to find out?" 
It took our rich dad only a few minutes to explain what assets and 
liabilities were. 
As an adult, I have difficulty explaining it to other adults. Why? Because 
adults are smarter. In most cases, the simplicity of the idea escapes most 
adults because they have been educated differently. They have been educated by 
other educated professionals, such as bankers, accountants, real estate agents, 
financial planners, and so forth. The difficulty comes in asking adults to 
unlearn, or become children again. An intelligent adult often feels it is 
demeaning to pay attention to simplistic definitions. 
Rich dad believed in the KISS principle-"Keep It Simple Stupid"-so he kept 
it simple for two young boys, and that made the financial foundation strong. 
So what causes the confusion? Or how could something so simple be so 
screwed up? Why would someone buy an asset that was really a liability. The 
answer is found in basic education. 
We focus on the word "literacy" and not "financial literacy." What defines 
something to be an asset, or something to be a liability are not words. In fact, 
if you really want to be confused, look up the words "asset" and "liability" in 
the dictionary. I know the definition may sound good to a trained accountant, 
but for the average person it makes no sense. But we adults are often too proud 
to admit that something does not make sense. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
As young boys, rich dad said, "What defines an asset is not words but 
numbers. And if you cannot read the numbers, you cannot tell an asset from a 
hole in the ground." 
"In accounting," rich dad would say, "it's not the numbers, but what the 
numbers are telling you. It's just like words. It's not the words, but the story 
the words are telling you. 
Many people read, but do not understand much. It's called reading 
comprehension. And we all have different abilities when it comes to reading 
comprehension. For example, I recently bought a new VCR. It came with an 
instruction book that explained how to program the VCR. All I wanted to do was 
record my favorite TV show on Friday night. I nearly went crazy trying to read 
the manual. Nothing in my world is more complex than learning how to program my 
VCR. I could read the words, but I understood nothing. I get an "A" for 
recognizing the words. I get an "F" for comprehension. And so it is with 
financial statements for most people. 
"If you want to be rich, you've got to read and understand numbers." If I 
heard that once, I heard it a thousand times from my rich dad. And I also heard, 
"The rich acquire assets and the poor and middle class acquire liabilities." 
Here is how to tell the difference between an asset and a liability. Most 
accountants and financial professionals do net agree with the definitions, but 
these simple drawings were the start of strong financial foundations for two 
young boys. 
To teach pre?teen boys, rich dad kept everything simple, using as many 
pictures as possible, as few words as possible, and no numbers for years. 
 
"This is the Cash Flow pattern of an asset."

The above box is an Income Statement, often called a Profit and Loss 
Statement. It measures income and expenses. Money in and money out. The bottom 
diagram is the Balance Sheet. It is called that because it is 
supposed to balance assets against liabilities. Many financial novices 
don't know the relationship between the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet. 
That relationship is vital to understand. 
The primary cause of financial struggle is simply not knowing the 
difference between an asset and a liability. The cause of the confusion is found 
in the definition of the two words. If you want a lesson in confusion, simply 
look up the words "asset" and "liability" in the dictionary. 
Now it may make sense to trained accountants, but to the average person, 
it may as well be written in Mandarin. You read the words in the definition, but 
true comprehension is difficult. 
So as I said earlier, my rich dad simply told two young boys that "assets 
put money in your pocket." Nice, simple and usable. 
 
"This is Cash Flow pattern of a liability."

Now that assets and liabilities have been defined through pictures, it may 
be easier to understand my definitions in words. 
An asset is something that puts money in my pocket. 
A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket. 
This is really all you need to know. If you want to be rich, simply spend 
your life buying assets. If you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life 
buying liabilities. It's not knowing the difference that causes most of the 
financial struggle in the real world. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial 
struggle. If people are having difficulties financially, there is something that 
they cannot read, either in numbers or words. Something is misunderstood. The 
rich are rich because they are more literate in different areas than people who 
struggle financially.  So if you want to be rich and maintain your wealth, it's 
important to be financially literate, in words as well as numbers. 
The arrows in the diagrams represent the flow of cash, or "cash flow." 
Numbers alone really mean little. Just as words alone mean little. It's the 
story that counts. In financial reporting, reading numbers is looking for the 
plot, the story. The story of where the cash is flowing. In 80 percent of most 
families, the financial story is a story of working hard in an effort to get 
ahead.  Not because they don't make money. But because they spend their lives 
buying liabilities instead of assets. 
For instance, this is the cash flow pattern of a poor person, or a young 
person still at home: 
 
Job (provides income)-> Expenses(Taxes Food Rent Clothes Fun 
Transportation) 
Asset (none) 
Liability (none) 
 
This is the cash flow pattern of a person in the middle class: 
 
Job (provides income)-> Expenses(Taxes Food Mortgage Clothes Fun 
Transportation) 
Asset (none) 
Liability (Mortgage Consumer loans Credit Cards) 
 
This is the cash flow pattern of a wealthy person: 
 
Assets(stocks bonds notes real estate intellectual property)->income 
(dividends interest rental income royalties) 
Liabilities (none) 
 
All of these diagrams were obviously oversimplified. Everyone has living 
expenses, the need for food, shelter and clothing. 
The diagrams show the flow of cash through a poor, middle class or wealthy 
person's life. It is the cash flow that tells the story. It is the story of how 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
a person handles their money, what they do after they get the money in their 
hand. 
The reason I started with the story of the richest men in America is to 
illustrate the flaw in the thinking of so many people. The flaw is that money 
will solve all problems. That is why I cringe whenever 1 hear people ask me how 
to get rich quicker.  Or where do they start? I often hear, "I'm in debt so I 
need lo make more money." 
But more money will often not solve the problem; in fact, it may actually 
accelerate the problem. Money often makes obvious our tragic human flaws.  Money 
often puts a spotlight on what we do not know. That is why, all too often, a 
person who comes into a sudden windfall of cash-let's say an inheritance, a pay 
raise or lottery winnings-soon returns to the same financial mess, if not worse 
than the mess they were in before they received the money.  Money only 
accentuates the cash flow pattern running in your head.  If your pattern is to 
spend everything you get, most likely an increase in cash will just result in an 
increase in spending. Thus, the saying, "A fool and his money is one big party," 
I have said many times that we go to school to gain scholastic skills and 
professional skills, both important. We learn to make money with our 
professional skills. In the 1960s, when I was in high school, if someone did 
well in school academically, almost immediately people assumed this bright 
student would go on to be a medical doctor.  Often no one asked the child if 
they wanted to be a doctor.  It was assumed.  It was the profession with the 
promise of the greatest financial reward. 
Today, doctors are facing financial challenges I would not wish on my 
worst enemy; insurance companies taking control of the business, managed health 
care, government intervention, and malpractice suits, to name a few. Today, kids 
want to be basketball stars, golfers like Tiger Woods, computer nerds, movie 
stare, rock stars, beauty queens, or traders on Wall Street.  Simply because 
that is where the fame, money and prestige is. That is the reason it is so hard 
to motivate kids in school today. They know that professional success is no 
longer solely linked to academic success, as it once was. 
Because students leave school without financial skills, millions of 
educated people pursue their profession successfully, but later find themselves 
struggling financially. They work harder, but don't get ahead. What is missing 
from their education is not how to make money, but how to spend money-what to do 
after you make it.  It's called financial aptitude-what you do with the money 
once you make it, how to keep people from taking it from you, how long you keep 
it, and how hard that money works for you. Most people cannot tell why they 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
struggle financially because they don't understand cash flow. A person can be 
highly educated, professionally successful and financially illiterate. These 
people often work harder than they need to because they learned how to work hard, 
but not how to have their money work for them. 
The story of bow the quest for a Financial Dream turns into a financial 
nightmare. The moving-picture show of hard-working people has a set pattern. 
Recently married, the happy, highly educated young couple move in together, in 
one of their cramped rented apartments.   Immediately, they realize that they 
are saving money because two can live as cheaply as 
one. 
The problem is, the apartment is cramped.  They decide to save money to 
buy their dream home so they can have kids. They now have two incomes, and they 
begin to focus on their careers. 
Their incomes begin to increase. 
As their incomes go up...their expenses go up as well. 
The No. 1 expense for most people is taxes. Many people think it's income 
tax, but for most Americans their highest tax is Social Security. As an employee, 
it appears as if the Social Security tax combined with the Medicare tax rate is 
roughly 7.5 percent, but it's really 15 percent since the employer must match 
the Social Security amount. In essence, it is money the employer cannot pay you.  
On top of that, you still have to pay income tax on the amount deducted from 
your wages for Social Security tax, income you never receive because it went 
directly to Social Security through withholding.  Then, their liabilities go up. 
This is best demonstrated by going back to the young couple. As a result 
of their incomes going up, they decide to go out and buy the house of their 
dreams.  Once in their house, they have a new tax, called property tax. Then, 
they buy a new car, new furniture and new appliances to match [heir new house. 
Ail of a sudden, they wake up and their liabilities column is full of mortgage 
debt and credit-card debt. 
They're now trapped in the rat race. A child comes along. They work harder.  
The process repeats itself.  More money and higher taxes, also called bracket 
creep, A credit card comes in the mail. They use it. It maxes out.  A loan 
company calls and says their greatest "asset," their home, has appreciated in 
value. The company offers a "bill consolidation" loan, because their credit is 
so good, and tells them the intelligent thing to do is clear off the high-
interest consumer debt by paying off their credit card. And besides, interest on 
their home is a tax deduction. They go for it, and pay off those high-interest 
credit cards. They breathe a sigh of relief. Their credit cards are paid off. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
They've now folded their consumer debt into their home mortgage.  Their payments 
go down because they extend their debt over 30 years.  It is the smart thing to 
do. 
Their neighbor calls to invite them to go shopping-the Memorial Day sale 
is on. A chance to save some money. They say to themselves, "I won't buy 
anything. I'll just go look." But just in case they find something, they tuck 
that clean credit card inside their wallet. 
I run into this young couple all the time. Their names change, but their 
financial dilemma is the same. They come to one of my talks to hear what I have 
to say. They ask me, "Can you tell us how to make more money?" Their spending 
habits have caused them to seek more income. 
They don't even know that the trouble is really how they choose to spend 
the money they do have, and that is the real cause of their financial struggle. 
It is caused by financial illiteracy and not understanding the difference 
between an asset and a liability. 
More money seldom solves someone's money problems.  Intelligence solves 
problems, There is a saying a friend of mine says over and over to people in 
debt. 
"If you find you have dug yourself into a hole... stop digging." 
As a child, my dad often told us that the Japanese were aware of three 
powers; "The power of the sword, the jewel and the mirror." 
The sword symbolizes the power of weapons. America has spent trillions of 
dollars on weapons and, because of this, is the supreme military presence in the 
world. 
The jewel symbolizes the power of money. There is some degree of truth to 
the saying, "Remember the golden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules." 
The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge. This self-knowledge, 
according to Japanese legend, was the most treasured of the three. 
The poor and middle class all loo often allow the power of money to 
control them. By simply getting up and working harder, failing to ask themselves 
if what they do makes sense, they shoot themselves in the foot as they leave for 
work every morning. By not fully understanding nioney, the vast majority of 
people allow the awesome power of money to control them. The power of money is 
used against them. 
If they used the power of the mirror, they would have asked themselves,  
"Does this make sense?" All too often, instead of trusting their inner wisdom, 
that genius inside of them, most people go along with the crowd. They do things 
because everybody else does it. They  conform rather than question.  Often, they 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
mindlessly repeat what they have been told. Ideas such as "diversify" or "your 
home is an asset." "Your home is your biggest investment."  "You get a tax break 
for going into greater debt."  "Get a safe job." "Don't make mistakes."  "Don't 
take risks." 
It is said that the fear of public speaking is a fear greater than death 
for most people. According to psychiatrists, the fear of public speaking is 
caused by the fear of ostracism, the fear of standing out, the fear of criticism, 
the fear of ridicule, the fear of being an outcast. The fear of being different 
prevents most people from seeking new ways to solve their problems. 
That is why my educated dad said the Japanese valued the power of the 
mirror the most, for it is only when we as humans look into the mirror do we 
find truth. And the main reason that most people say "Play it safe1' is out of 
fear. That goes for anything, be it sports, relationships, career, money. 
It is that same fear, the fear of ostracism that causes people to conform 
and not question commonly accepted opinions or popular trends.  "Your home is an 
asset." "Get a bill consolidation loan and get out of debt."  "Work harder."  
"It's a promotion." "Someday I'll be a vice president." "Save money." "When ! 
get a raise, I'll buy us a bigger house."  "Mutual funds are safe." "Tickle Me 
Elmo dolls are out of stock, but I just happen to have one in back that another 
customer has not come by for yet." 
Many great financial problems are caused by going along with the crowd and 
trying to keep up with the Joneses.  Occasionally, we all need to look in the 
mirror and be true to our inner wisdom rather than our fears. 
By the time Mike and I were 16 years old, we began to have problems in 
school. We were not bad kids. We just began to separate from the crowd. We 
worked for Mike's dad after school and on the weekends.  Mike and I often spent 
hours after work just sitting at a table with his dad while he held meetings 
with his bankers, attorneys, accountants, brokers, investors, managers and 
employees. Here was a man who had left school at the age of 13, now directing, 
instructing, ordering and asking questions of educated people. They came at his 
beck and call, and cringed when he did not approve of them. 
Here was a man who had not gone along with the crowd.   He was a man who 
did his own thinking and detested the words, "We have to do it this way because 
that's the way everyone else does it." He also hated the word "can't." If you 
wanted him to do something, just say, "I don't think 
you can do it." 
Mike and I learned more sitting at his meetings than we did in all our 
years of school, college included. Mike's dad was not school educated, but he 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
was financially educated and successful as a result.  He use to tell us over and 
over again.  "An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than 
they are." So Mike and I had the benefit of spending hours listening to and, in 
the process, learning From 
intelligent people. 
But because of this, both Mike and I just could not go along with the 
standard dogma that our teachers preached, And that caused the problems. 
Whenever the teacher said, "If you don't get good grades, you won't do well in 
the real world," Mike and I just raised our eyebrows. When we were told to 
follow set procedures and not deviate from the rules, we could see how this 
schooling process actually discouraged creativity. We started to understand why 
our rich dad told us that schools were designed to produce good employees 
instead of employers. 
Occasionally Mike or I would ask our teachers how what we studied was 
applicable, or we asked why we never studied money and how it worked. To the 
later question, we often got the answer that money was not important, that if we 
excelled in our education, the money would follow. 
The more we knew about the power of money, the more distant we grew from 
the teachers and our classmates. 
My highly educated dad never pressured me about my grades. I often 
wondered why.  But we did begin to argue about money. By the time I was 16, I 
probably had a far better foundation with money than both my mom and dad.  I 
could keep books, I listened to tax accountants, corporate attorneys, bankers, 
real estate brokers, investors and so forth.  My dad talked to teachers. 
One day, my dad was telling me why our home was his greatest investment. A 
not-too-pleasant argument took place when I showed him why I thought a house was 
not a good investment. 
The following diagram illustrates the difference in perception between my 
rich dad and my poor dad when it came to their homes. One dad thought his house 
was an asset, and the other dad thought it was a liability. 
I remember when I drew a diagram for my dad showing him the direction of 
cash flow.  I also showed him the ancillary expenses that went along with owning 
the home. A bigger home meant bigger expenses, and the cash flow kept going out 
through the expense column. 
Today, I am still challenged on the idea of a house not being an asset. 
And 1 know that for many people, it is their dream as well as their largest 
investment. And owning your own home is better than nothing. I simply offer an 
alternate way of looking at this popular dogma. If my wife and I were to buy a 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
bigger, more flashy house we realize it would not be an asset, it would be a 
liability, since it would take money out of 
our pocket. 
So here is the argument I put forth. I really do not expect most people to 
agree with it because a nice home is an emotional thing.  And when it comes to 
money, high emotions tend to lower financial intelligence.  1 know from personal 
experience that money has a way of making every decision emotional. 
1. When it comes to houses, I point out that most people work all their 
lives paying for a home they never own.  In other words, most people buy a new 
house every so many years, each time incurring a new 30-year loan to pay off the 
previous one. 
2. Even though people receive a tax deduction for interest on mortgage 
payments, they pay for all their other expenses with after-tax dollars. Even 
after they pay off their mortgage. 
3. Property taxes. My wife's parents were shocked when the property taxes 
on their home went to $1,000 a month. This was after they had retired, so the 
increase put a strain on their retirement budget, and they felt forced to move. 
4 Houses do not always go up in value.  In 1997, I still have friends who 
owe a million dollars for a home that will today sell for only $700,000. 
5. The greatest losses of all are those from missed opportunities.  If all 
your money is tied up in your house, you may be forced to work harder because 
your money continues blowing out of the expense column, instead of adding to the 
asset column, the classic middle class cash flow pattern. If a young couple 
would put more money into their asset column early on, their later years would 
get easier, especially as they prepared to send their children to college. Their 
assets would have grown and would be available to help cover expenses. All too 
often, a house only serves as a vehicle for incurring a home-equity loan to pay 
for mounting expenses. In summary, the end result in making a decision to own a 
house that is too expensive in lieu of starting an investment portfolio early on 
impacts an individual in at least the following three ways: 
 
 
1. Loss of time, during which other assets could have grown in value. 
2. Loss of additional capital, which could have been invested instead of 
paying for high-maintenance expenses related directly to the home. 
3. Loss of education. Too often, people count their house, savings and 
retirement plan as all they have in their asset column. Because they have no 
money to invest, they simply do not invest. This costs them investment

experience.  Most never become what the investment world calls a "sophisticated 
investor." And the best investments are usually first sold to "sophisticated 
investors," who then turn around and sell them to the people playing it safe. I 
am not saying don't buy a house. I am saying, understand the difference between 
an asset and a liability. When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that 
will generate the cash flow to pay for the house. 
My educated dad's personal financial statement best demonstrates the life 
of someone in the rat race.  His expenses seem to always keep up with his income, 
never allowing him to invest in assets. As a result, his liabilities, such as 
his mortgage and credit card debts are larger than his assets.  The following 
picture is worth a thousand words: 
 
Educated Dad's Financial Statement 
 
Income=Expense 
Asset < Liability 
 
My rich dad's personal financial statement, on the other hand, reflects 
the results of a life dedicated to investing and minimizing liabilities: 
 
Rich Dad's Financial Statement 
 
Income > Expense 
Asset > Liability 
 
A review of my rich dad's financial statement is why the rich get richer. 
The asset column generates more than enough income to cover expenses, with the 
balance reinvested into the asset column. The asset column continues to grow and, 
therefore, the income it produces grows with it. 
The result being: The rich get richer! 
 
Why the Rich Get Richer 
 
Income -> Assets -> More Income 
Expenses are low, Liabilities are low 
 
The middle class finds itself in a constant state of financial struggle. 
Their primary- income is through wages, and as their wages increase, so do their 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
taxes. Their expenses tend to increase in equal increments as their wages 
increase; hence the phrase "the rat race." They treat their home as their 
primary asset, instead on investing in income-producing assets. 
 
Why the Middle Class Struggle 
 
Income goes up, Expenses go up 
Assets do not increase, Liabilities do increase 
 
This pattern of treating your home as an investment and the philosophy 
that a pay raise means you can buy a larger home or spend more is the foundation 
of today's debt-ridden society. This process of increased spending throws 
families into greater debt and into more financial uncertainty, even though they 
may be advancing in their jobs and receiving pay raises on a regular basis. This 
is high risk living caused by weak financial education. 
The massive loss of jobs in the 1990s-the downsizing of businesses-has 
brought to light how shaky the middle class really is financially.  Suddenly, 
company pension plans are being replaced by 401k plans. Social Security is 
obviously in trouble and cannot be looked at as a source for retirement. Panic 
has sei in for the middle class. The good thing today is that many of these 
people have recognized these issues and have begun buying mutual funds. This 
increase in investing is largely responsible for the huge rally we have seen in 
the stock market. Today, there are more and more mutual funds being created to 
answer the demand by the middle class. 
Mutual funds are popular because they represent safety. Average mutual 
fund buyers are too busy working to pay taxes and mortgages, save for their 
children's college and pay off credit cards.  They do not have time to study to 
learn how to invest, so they rely on the expertise of the manager of a mutual 
fund. Also, because the mutual fund includes many different types of investments, 
they feel their money is safer because ii is "diversified." 
This group of educated middle class subscribes to the "diversify" dogma 
put out by mutual fund brokers and financial planners.  Play it safe. Avoid risk. 
The real tragedy is that the lack of early financial education is what 
creates the risk faced by average middle class people. The reason they have to 
play it safe is because their financial positions are tenuous at best.  Their 
balance sheets are not balanced. They are loaded with liabilities, with no real 
assets that generate income. Typically, their only source of income is their 
paycheck. Their livelihood becomes entirely dependent on their employer. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
So when genuine "deals of a lifetime" come along, those same people cannot 
take advantage of the opportunity. They must play it safe, simply because they 
are working so hard, are taxed to the max, and are loaded with debt. 
As I said at the start of this section, the most important rule is to know 
the difference between an asset and a liability.  Once you understand the 
difference, concentrate your efforts on only buying income-generating assets.  
That's the best way to get started on a path to becoming rich.  Keep doing that, 
and your asset column will grow. Focus on keeping liabilities and expenses down. 
This will make more money available to continue pouring into the asset column. 
Soon, the asset base will be so deep that you can afford to look at more 
speculative investments.  Investments that may have returns of 100 percent to 
infinity. Investments that for $5,000 are soon turned into $1 million or more. 
Investments that the middle class calls "too risky." The investment is not risky.  
It's the lack of simple financial intelligence, beginning with financial 
literacy, that causes the individual to be "too risky," 
If you do what the masses do, you get the following picture. 
 
Income = Work for Owner 
Expense = Work for Government 
Asset = (none) 
Liability = Work for Bank 
 
As an employee who is also a homeowner, your working efforts are generally 
as follows: 
1. You work for someone else.  Most people, working for a paycheck, are 
making the owner, or the shareholders richer. Your efforts and success will help 
provide for the owner's success and retirement. 
2. You work for the government. The government takes its share from your 
paycheck before you even see it.  By working harder, you simply increase the 
amount of taxes taken by the government - most people work from January to May 
just for the government. 
3. You work for the bank. After taxes, your next largest expense is 
usually your mortgage and credit card debt. 
The problem with simply working harder is that each of these three levels 
takes a greater share of your increased efforts. You need to learn how to have 
your increased efforts benefit you and your family directly. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Once you have decided to concentrate on minding your own business, how do 
you set your goals?  For most people, they must keep their profession and rely 
on their wages to fund their acquisition of assets. 
As their assets grow, how do they measure the extent of their success? 
When does someone realize that they are rich, that they have wealth? As well as 
having my own definitions for assets and liabilities, I also have my own 
definition for wealth. Actually I borrowed it from a man named Buckminster 
Fuller.  Some call him a quack, and others call him a living genius.  Years ago 
he got all the architects buzzing because he applied for a patent in 1961 for 
something called a geodesic dome. But in the application, Fuller also said 
something about wealth.  It was pretty confusing at first, but after reading it 
for awhile, it began to make some sense: Wealth is a person's ability to survive 
so many number of days forward... or if I stopped working today, how long could 
I survive? 
Unlike net worth-the difference between your assets and liabilities, which 
is often filled with a person's expensive junk and opinions of what things are 
worth-this definition creates the possibility for developing a truly accurate 
measurement.  I could now measure and really know where I was in terms of my 
goal to become financially independent. 
Although net worth often includes these non-cash-producing assets, like 
stuff you bought that now sits in your garage, wealth measures how much money 
your money is making and, therefore, your financial survivability. 
Wealth is the measure of the cash flow from the asset column compared with 
the expense column. 
Let's use an example. Let's say I have cash flow from my asset column of 
S"J,000 a month. And I have monthly expenses of 52,000. What is my wealth? 
Let's go back to Buckminster Fuller's definition. Using his definition, 
how many days forward can I survive? And let's assume a 30-day month. By that 
definition, I have enough cash flow for half a month. 
When I have achieved $2,000 a month cash flow from my assets, then I will 
be wealthy. 
So I am not yet rich, but I am wealthy.  I now have income generated from 
assets each month that fully cover my monthly expenses. If I want to increase my 
expenses, I first must increase my cash flow from assets to maintain this level 
of wealth. Take notice that it is at this point that I no longer am dependent on 
my wages.  I have focused on and been successful in building an asset column 
that has made me financially independent.   If I quit my job today, I would be 
able to cover my monthly expenses with the cash flow from my assets. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
My next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my assets 
reinvested into the asset column.  The more money that goes into my asset column, 
the more my asset column grows. The more my assets grow, the more my cash flow 
grows. And as long as I keep my expenses less than the cash flow from these 
assets, I will grow richer, with more and more income from sources other than my 
physical labor. 
As this reinvestment process continues, I am well on my way to being rich.  
The actual definition of rich is in the eye of the beholder. You can never be 
too rich. 
Just remember this simple observation: The rich buy assets. The poor only 
have expenses. The middle class buys liabilities they think are assets. So how 
do I start minding my own business? What is the answer? Listen to the founder of 
McDonald's. 
 
4. CHAPTER FOUR  
Lesson Three: Mind Your Own Business 
 
In 1974, Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, was asked to speak to the 
MBA class at the University of Texas at Austin. A dear friend of mine, Keith 
Cunningham, was a student in that MBA class. After a powerful and inspiring talk, 
the class adjourned and the students asked Ray if he would join them at their 
favorite hangout to have a few beers.  Ray graciously accepted. 
"What business am I in?" Ray asked, once the group had all their beers in 
hand. 
"Everyone laughed," said Keith. "Most of the MBA students thought Ray was 
just fooling around." 
No one answered, so Ray asked the question again. "What business do you 
think I'm in?" 
The students laughed again, and finally one brave soul yelled out, "Ray, 
who in the world does not know that you're in the hamburger business." 
Ray chuckled. "That is what I thought you would say." He paused and then 
quickly said, 'ladies and gentlemen, I'm not in the hamburger business. My 
business is real estate." 
Keith said that Ray spent a good amount of time explaining his viewpoint.   
In their business plan, Ray knew that the primary business focus was to sell 
hamburger franchises, but what he never lost sight of was the location of each 
franchise. He knew that the real estate and its location was the most 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
significant factor in the success of each franchise. Basically, the person that 
bought the franchise was also paying for, buying, the land under the franchise 
for Ray Kroc's organization. 
McDonald's today is the largest single owner of real estate in the world, 
owning even more than the Catholic Church. Today, McDonald's owns some of the 
most valuable intersections and street corners in America, as well as in other 
parts of the world. 
Keith said it was one of the most important lessons in his life. Today, 
Keith owns car washes, but his business is the real estate under those car 
washes. 
The previous chapter ended with the diagrams illustrating that most people 
work for everyone else but themselves. They work first for the owners of the 
company, then for the government through taxes, and finally for the bank that 
owns their mortgage. 
As a young boy, we did not have a McDonald's nearby. Yet, my rich dad was 
responsible for teaching Mike and me the same lesson that Ray Kroc talked about 
at the University of Texas.  It is secret No. 3 of the rich. 
The secret is: "Mind your own business/' Financial struggle is often 
directly the result of people working all their life for someone else. Many 
people will have nothing at the end of their working days. 
Again, a picture is worth a thousand words.  Here is a diagram of the 
income statement and balance sheet that best describes Ray Kroc's advice: 
 
Most people  
 
Your Profession -> Your Income 
 
The Rich 
 
 
Your Assets -> Your Income 
 
Our current educational system focuses on preparing today's youth to get 
good jobs by developing scholastic skills. Their lives will revolve around their 
wages, or as described earlier, their income column. And after developing 
scholastic skills, they go on to higher levels of schooling to enhance their 
professional abilities. They study to become engineers, scientists, cooks, 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
police officers, artists, writers and so on. These professional skills allow 
them to enter the workforce and work for money. 
There is a big difference between your profession and your business. Often 
I ask people, "What is your business?" And they will say, "Oh I'm a banker." 
Then I ask them if they own the bank? And they usually respond.  "No, I work 
there." 
In that instance, they have confused their profession with their business. 
Their profession may be a banker, but they still need their own business.  Ray 
Kroc was clear on the difference between his profession and his business. His 
profession was always the same.  Me was a salesman. At one time he sold mixers 
for milkshakes, and soon thereafter he was selling hamburger franchises- But 
while his profession was selling hamburger franchises, his business was the 
accumulation of income-producing real estate. 
A problem with school is that you often become what you study.  So if you 
study, say, cooking, you become a chef.  If you study the law, you become an 
attorney, and a study of auto mechanics makes you a mechanic. The mistake in 
becoming what you study is that too many people forget to mind their own 
business. They spend their lives minding someone else's business and making that 
person rich. 
To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business.  
Your business revolves around your asset column, as opposed to your income 
column. As stated earlier, the No. 1 rule is to know the difference between an 
asset and a liability, and to buy assets. The rich focus on their asset columns 
while everyone else focuses on their income statements. 
That is why we hear so often: "I need a raise."  "If only I had a 
promotion."  "I am going to go back to school to get more training so I can get 
a better job."   "I am going to work overtime."  "Maybe I can get a second job."  
"I'm quitting in two weeks.   I found a job that pays more." 
In some circles, these are sensible ideas.  Yet, if you listen to Ray Kroc, 
you are still not minding your own business.  These ideas all still focus on the 
income column and will only help a person become more financially secure if the 
additional money is used to purchase income-generating assets. 
The primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are fiscally 
conservative-which means. "I can't afford to take risks"-is that they have no 
financial foundation.  They have to cling to their jobs. They have to play it 
safe.  
When downsizing became the "in" thing lo do, millions of workers    | 
found out their largest so-called asset, their home, was eating them alive, j 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Their asset, called a house, still cost them money every month. Their car, 
another "asset," was eating them alive. The golf clubs in the garage that cost 
$1,000 were not worth 51,000 anymore.  Without job security, they had nothing to 
fall back on.  What they thought were assets could not help them survive in a 
time of financial crisis. 
1 assume most of us have filled out a credit application for a banker to 
buy a house or to buy a car.  It is always interesting to look at the "net 
worth'1 section.  It is interesting because of what accepted banking and 
accounting practices allow a person to count as assets. 
One day, to get a loan, my financial position did not look too good. So I 
added my new golf clubs, my art collection, books, stereo, television, Armani 
suits, wristwatches, shoes and other personal effects to boost the number in the 
asset column. 
But I was turned down for the loan because I had too much investment real 
estate. The loan committee did not like that 1 made so much money off of 
apartment houses. They wanted to know why I did not have a normal job, with a 
salary. They did not question the Armani suits, golf clubs or art collection.  
Life is sometimes tough when you do not fit the "standard" profile. 
I cringe every time I hear someone say to me that their net worth is a 
million dollars or $100,000 dollars or whatever.  One of the main reasons net 
worth is not accurate is simply because the moment you begin selling your assets, 
you are taxed for any gains. 
So many people have put themselves in deep financial trouble when they run 
short of income. To raise cash, they sell their assets. First, their personal 
assets can generally be sold for only a fraction of the value that is listed in 
their personal balance sheet. Or if there is a gain on the sale of the assets, 
they are taxed on the gain. So again, the government takes its share of the gain, 
thus reducing the amount available to help them out 
Of debt. That is why I say someone's net worth is often "worth less" than 
they think. 
Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying 
real assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no real value once 
you get them home. A new car loses nearly 25 percent of the price you pay for it 
the moment you drive it off the lot. It is not a true asset even if your banker 
lets you list it as one.  My $400 new titanium driver was worth S150 the moment 
I teed off. 
For adults, keep your expenses low, reduce your liabilities and diligently 
build a base of solid assets. For young people who have not yet left home, it is 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
important for parents to teach them the difference between an asset and a 
liability.  Get them to start building a solid asset column before they leave 
home, get married, buy a house, have kids and get stuck in a risky financial 
position, clinging to a job and buying everything on credit.  I see so many 
young couples who get married and trap themselves into a lifestyle that will not 
let them get out of debt for most of their working years. 
For most people, just as the last child leaves home, the parents realize 
they have not adequately prepared for retirement and they begin to scramble to 
put some money away. Then, their own parents become ill and they find themselves 
with new responsibilities. 
So what kind of assets am I suggesting that you or your children acquire? 
In my world, real assets fall into several different categories: 
1. Businesses that do not require my presence. I own them, but they are 
managed or run by other people.  If I have to work there, it's not a business.  
It becomes my job. 
2. Stocks. 
3. Bonds. 
4. Mutual funds. 
5. Income-generating real estate. 
6. Notes (lOUs). 
7. Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, patents. 
8. And anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates and 
has a ready market. 
As a young boy, my educated dad encouraged me to find a safe job. My rich 
dad, on the other hand, encouraged me to begin acquiring assets that I loved.  
"If you don't love it, you won't take care of it." I collect real estate simply 
because I love buildings and land.  I love shopping for them.  1 could look at 
them all day long. When problems arise, the problems are not so bad that it 
changes my love for real estate.  For people who hate real estate, they 
shouldn't buy it. 
I love stocks of small companies, especially startups. The reason is that 
I am an entrepreneur, not a corporate person.   In my early years. I worked in 
large organizations, such as Standard Oil of California, the U.S. Marine Corps, 
and Xerox Corp.  I enjoyed my time with those organizations and have fond 
memories, but I know deep down I am not a company man. I like starting companies, 
not running them.  So my slock buys are usually of small companies, and 
sometimes I even start the company and take it public.  Fortunes are made in 
new-stock issues, and I love the game. Many people are afraid of small-cap 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
companies and call them risky, and they are. But risk is always diminished if 
you love what the investment is, understand it and know the game. With small 
companies, my investment strategy is to be out of the stock in a year.  My real 
estate strategy, on the other hand, is to start small and keep trading the 
properties up for bigger properties and, therefore, delaying paying taxes on the 
gain. This allows the value to increase dramatically. I generally hold real 
estate less than seven years. 
For years, even while I was with the Marine Corps and Xerox, I did what my 
rich dad recommended.  I kept my daytime job, but I still minded my own business. 
I was active in my asset column.  I traded real estate and small stocks.  Rich 
dad always stressed the importance of financial literacy. The better I was at 
understanding the accounting and cash management, the better I would be at 
analyzing investments and eventually starting and building my own company. 
I would not encourage anyone to start a company unless they really want to. 
Knowing what I know about running a company, I would not wish that task on 
anyone. There are times when people cannot find employment, where starting a 
company is a solution for them.  The odds are against success: Nine out of 10 
companies fail in five years.  Of those that survive the first five years, nine 
out of every 10 of those eventually fail, as well.   So only if you really have 
the desire to own your own company do I recommend it. Otherwise, keep your 
daytime job and mind your own business. When I say mind your own business, 1 
mean to build and keep your asset column strong. Once a dollar goes into it, 
never let it come out. Think of it this way, once a dollar goes into your asset 
column, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 24 
hours a day and can work for generations.  Keep your daytime job, be a great 
hard-working employee, but keep building that asset column. 
As your cash flow grows, you can buy some luxuries. An important 
distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle 
class tend to buy luxuries first. The poor and the middle class often buy luxury 
items such as big houses, diamonds, furs, jewelry or boats because they want to 
look rich. They look rich, but in reality they just get deeper in debt on credit. 
The old-money people, the long-term rich, built their asset column first.  Then, 
the income generated from the asset column bought their luxuries. The poor and 
middle class buy luxuries with their own sweat, blood and children's inheritance. 
A true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a real asset. 
For example, when my wife and I had extra money coming from our apartment houses, 
she went out and bought her Mercedes. It did not take any extra work or risk on 
her part because the apartment house bought the car.  She did, however, have to 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
wait for it for four years while the real estate investment portfolio grew and 
finally began throwing off enough extra cash flow to pay for the car.  But the 
luxury, the Mercedes, was a true reward because she had proved she knew how to 
grow her asset column. That car now means a lot more to her than simply another 
pretty car.  It means she used her financial intelligence to afford it. 
What most people do is they impulsively go out and buy a new car, or some 
other luxury, on credit. They may feel bored and just want a new toy.  Buying a 
luxury on credit often causes a person to sooner or later actually resent that 
luxury because the debt on the luxury becomes a financial burden. 
After you've taken the time and invested in and built your own business, 
you are now ready to add the magic touch-the biggest secret of the rich. The 
secret that puts the rich way ahead of the pack. The reward at the end of the 
road for diligently taking the time to mind your own business. 
 
5. CHAPTER FIVE  
Lesson Four:The History of and The Power of Corporation 
 
I remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and his Merry Men. 
My schoolteacher thought it was a wonderful story of a romantic hero, a Kevin 
Costner type, who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. My rich dad did not 
see Robin Hood as a hero. He called Robin Hood a crook. 
Robin Hood may be long gone, but his followers live on. How often I still 
hear people say, "Why don't the rich pay for it?" Or "The rich should pay more 
in taxes and give it to the poor." 
It is this idea of Robin Hood, or taking from the rich to give to the poor 
that has caused the most pain for the poor and the middle class. The reason the 
middle class is so heavily taxed is because of the Robin Hood ideal. The real 
reality is that the rich are not taxed. It's the middle class who pays for the 
poor, especially the educated upper-income middle class. 
Again, to understand fully how things happen, we need to look at the 
historical perspective. We need to look at the history of taxes. Although my 
highly educated dad was an expert on the history of education, my rich dad 
fashioned himself as an expert on the history of taxes. 
Rich dad explained to Mike and me that in England and America originally, 
there were no taxes. Occasionally there were temporary taxes levied in order to 
pay for wars. The king or the president would put the word out and ask everyone 
to "chip in." Taxes were levied in Britain for the fight against Napoleon from 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
1799 to 1816, and in America taxes were levied to pay for the Civil War from 
1861 to 1865. 
In 1874, England made income tax a permanent levy on its citizens. In 1913, 
an income tax became permanent in the United States with the adoption of the 
16th Amendment to the Constitution. At one time, Americans were anti-tax. It had 
been the excessive tax on tea that led to the famous Tea Party in Boston Harbor, 
an incident that helped ignite the Revolutionary War. It took approximately 50 
years in both England and  '• the United States to sell the idea of a regular 
income tax. ; 
What these historical dates fail to reveal is that both of these taxes 
were initially levied against only the rich. It was this point that rich dad 
wanted Mike and me to understand. He explained that the idea of taxes was made 
popular, and accepted by the majority, by telling the poor and the middle class 
that taxes were created only to punish the rich. This is how the masses voted 
for the law, and it became constitutionally legal. Although it was intended to 
punish the rich, in reality it wound up punishing the very people who voted for 
it, the poor and middle class. 
"Once government got a taste of money, the appetite grew," said rich dad. 
"Your dad and I are exactly opposite. He's a government bureaucrat, and I am a 
capitalist. We get paid, and our success is measured on opposite behaviors. He 
gets paid to spend money and hire people. The more he spends and the more people 
he hires, the larger his organization becomes. In the government, the larger his 
organization, the more he is respected.  On the other hand, within my 
organization, the fewer people I hire and the less money I spend, the more I am 
respected by my investors. That's why I don't like government people. They have 
different objectives from most business people. As the government grows, more 
and more tax dollars will be needed to support it." 
My educated dad sincerely believed that government should help 
people. He loved John F. Kennedy and especially the idea of the Peace 
Corps. He loved the idea so much that both he and my mom worked for the Peace 
Corps training volunteers to go to Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. He 
always strived for additional grants and increases in his budget so he could 
hire more people, both in his job with the Education Department and in the Peace 
Corps. That was his job. 
From the time I was about 10 years old, I would hear from my rich dad that 
government workers were a pack of lazy thieves, and from my poor dad I would 
hear how the rich were greedy crooks who should be made to pay more taxes. Both 
sides have valid points. It was difficult to go to work for one of the biggest 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
capitalists in town and come home to a father who was a prominent government 
leader. It was not easy knowing who to believe. 
Yet, when you study the history of taxes, an interesting perspective 
emerges. As I said, the passage of taxes was only possible because the masses 
believed in the Robin Hood theory of economics, which was to take from the rich 
and give to everyone else. The problem was that the government's appetite for 
money was so great that taxes soon needed to be levied on the middle class, and 
from there it kept "trickling down." 
The rich, on the other hand, saw an opportunity. They do not play by the 
same set of rules. As I've stated, the rich already knew about corporations, 
which became popular in the days of sailing ships. The rich created the 
corporation as a vehicle to limit their risk to the assets of each voyage. The 
rich put their money into a corporation to finance the voyage. The corporation 
would then hire a crew to sail to the New World to look for treasures. If the 
ship was lost, the crew lost their lives, but the loss to the rich would be 
limited only to the money they invested for that particular voyage. The diagram 
that follows shows how the corporate structure sits outside your personal income 
statement and balance sheet. 
 
How the Rich Play the Game 
 
               Is reduced/diminished by expenses 
Assets  ------------------------------------------------> Income 
                  (through personal corporation) 
 
It is the knowledge of the power of the legal structure of the corporation 
that really gives the rich a vast advantage over the poor and the middle class. 
Having two fathers teaching me, one a socialist and the other a capitalist, I 
quickly began to realize that the philosophy of the capitalist made more 
financial sense to me. It seemed to me that the socialists ultimately penalized 
themselves, due to their lack of financial education. No matter what the "Take 
from the rich" crowd came up with, the rich always found a way to outsmart them. 
That is how taxes were eventually levied on the middle class. The rich 
outsmarted the intellectuals, solely because they understood the power of money, 
a subject not taught in schools. 
How did the rich outsmart the intellectuals? Once the "Take from the rich" 
tax was passed, cash started flowing into government coffers. Initially, people 
were happy. Money was handed out to government workers and the rich. It went to 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
government workers in the form of jobs and pensions. It went to the rich via 
their factories receiving government contracts. The government became a large 
pool of money, but the problem was the fiscal management of that money. There 
really is no recirculation. In other words, the government policy, if you were a 
government bureaucrat, was to avoid having excess money. If you failed to spend 
your allotted funding, you risked losing it in the next budget. 
You would certainly not be recognized for being efficient.  Business 
people, on the other hand, are rewarded for having excess money and are 
recognized for their efficiency. 
As this cycle of growing government spending continued, the demand for 
money increased and the "Tax the rich" idea was now being adjusted to include 
lower-income levels, down to the very people who voted it in, the poor and the 
middle class. 
True capitalists used their financial knowledge to simply find a way to 
escape. They headed back to the protection of a corporation. A corporation 
protects the rich. But what many people who have never formed a corporation do 
not know is that a corporation is not really a thing. A corporation is merely a 
file folder with some legal documents in it, sitting in some attorney's office 
registered with a state government agency. It's not a big building with the name 
of the corporation on it. It's not a factory or a group of people. A corporation 
is merely a legal document that creates a legal body without a soul. The wealth 
of the rich was once again protected. Once again, the use of corporations became 
popular-once the permanent income laws were passed- because the income-tax rate 
of the corporation was less than the individual income-tax rates.  In addition, 
as described earlier, certain expenses could be paid with pre-tax dollars within 
the corporation. 
This war between the haves and have-nots has been going on for hundreds of 
years. It is the "Take from the rich" crowd versus the rich. The battle is waged 
whenever and wherever laws are made. The battle will go on forever. The problem 
is, the people who lose are the uninformed. The ones who get up every day and 
diligently go to work and pay taxes. If they only understood the way the rich 
play the game, they could play it too. Then, they would be on their way to their 
own financial independence. This is why I cringe every time I hear a parent 
advise their children to go to school, so they can find a safe, secure job. An 
employee with a safe, secure job, without financial aptitude, has no escape. 
Average Americans today work five to six months for the government before 
they make enough to cover their taxes. In my opinion, that is a long time. The 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
harder you work, the more you pay the government. That is why I believe that the 
idea of "Take from the rich" backfired on the very people who voted it in. 
Every time people try to punish the rich, the rich don't simply 
comply, they react. They have the money, power and intent to change things. 
They do not just sit there and voluntarily pay more taxes. They search for ways 
to minimize their tax burden. They hire smart attorneys j and accountants, and 
persuade politicians to change laws or create legal loopholes. They have the 
resources to effect change. 
The Tax Code of the United States also allows other ways to save on taxes. 
Most of these vehicles are available to anyone, but it is the rich who usually 
look for them because they are minding their own business. For example, "1031" 
is jargon for Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, which allows a seller 
to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate; that is sold for a capital gain 
through an exchange for a more expensive piece of real estate. Real estate is 
one investment vehicle that allows such a great tax advantage. As long as you 
keep trading up in value, you I will not be taxed on the gains, until you 
liquidate. People who do not take advantage of these tax savings offered legally 
are missing a great opportunity to build their asset columns. 
The poor and middle class do not have the same resources. They sit there 
and let the government's needles enter their arm and allow the blood donation to 
begin. Today, I am constantly shocked at the number of people who pay more taxes, 
or take fewer deductions, simply because they are afraid of the government. And 
I do know how frightening and intimidating a government tax agent can be.  I 
have had friends who have had their businesses shut down and destroyed, only to 
find out it was a mistake on the part of the government. I realize all that. But 
the price of working from January to mid-May is a high price to pay for that 
intimidation. My poor dad never fought back. My rich dad didn't either. He just 
played the game smarter, and he did it through corporations-the biggest secret 
of the rich. 
You may remember the first lesson I learned from my rich dad. I was a 
little boy of 9 who had to sit and wait for him to choose to talk to me. I often 
sat in his office waiting for him to "get to me." He was ignoring me on purpose.  
He wanted me to recognize his power and desire to have that power for myself one 
day. For all the years I studied J and learned from him, he always reminded me 
that knowledge was power. And with money comes great power that requires the 
right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge, the 
world pushes you around.  Rich dad constantly reminded Mike and me that the 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
biggest bully was not the boss or the supervisor, but the tax man. The tax man 
will always take more if you let him. 
The first lesson of having money work for me, as opposed to working for 
money, is really all about power. If you work for money, you give the power up 
to your employer. If your money works for you, you keep and control the power. 
Once we had this knowledge of the power of money working for us, he wanted 
us to be financially smart and not let bullies push us around. You need to know 
the law and how the system works. If you're ignorant, it is easy to be bullied. 
If you know what you're talking about, you have a fighting chance. That is why 
he paid so much for smart tax accountants and attorneys. It was less expensive 
to pay them than pay the government. His best lesson to me, which I have used 
most of my life, is "Be smart and you won't be pushed around as much." He knew 
the law because he was a law-abiding citizen. He knew the law because it was 
expensive to not know the law.  "If you know you're right, you're not afraid of 
fighting back." Even if you are taking on Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men. 
My highly educated dad always encouraged me to seek a good job with a 
strong corporation. He spoke of the virtues of "working your way up the 
corporate ladder." He didn't understand that, by relying solely on a paycheck 
from a corporate employer, I would be a docile cow ready for milking. 
When I told my rich dad of my father's advice, he only chuckled. "Why not 
own the ladder?" was all he said. 
As a young boy, I did not understand what rich dad meant by owning my own 
corporation. It was an idea that seemed impossible, and intimidating. Although I 
was excited by the idea, my youth would not let me envision the possibility that 
grownups would someday work for a company I would own. 
The point is, if not for my rich dad, I would have probably followed my 
educated dad's advice. It was merely the occasional reminder of my rich dad that 
kept the idea of owning my own corporation alive and kept me on a different path. 
By the time I was 15 or 16, I knew I was not going to continue down the path my 
educated dad was recommending. I did not know how I was going to do it, but I 
was determined not to head in the direction most of my classmates were heading. 
That decision changed my life. 
It was not until I was in my mid-20s that my rich dad's advice began to 
make more sense. I was just out of the Marine Corps and working for Xerox. I was 
making a lot of money, but every time I looked at my paycheck, I was always 
disappointed. The deductions were so large, and the more I worked, the greater 
the deductions. As I became more successful, my bosses talked about promotions 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
and raises.  It was flattering, but I could hear my rich dad asking me in my ear: 
"Who are you working for? Who are you making rich?" 
In 1974, while still an employee for Xerox, I formed my first corporation 
and began "minding my own business." There were already a few assets in my asset 
column, but now I was determined to focus on making it bigger. Those paychecks 
with all the deductions made all the years of my rich dad's advice make total 
sense. I could see the future if I followed my educated dad's advice. 
Many employers feel that advising their workers to mind their own business 
is bad for business. I am sure it can be for certain individuals. But for me, 
focusing on my own business, developing assets, made me a better employee. I now 
had a purpose. I came in early and worked diligently, amassing as much money as 
possible so I could begin investing in real estate.  Hawaii was just set to boom, 
and there were     4 fortunes to be made. The more I realized we were in the 
beginning stages of a boom, the more Xerox machines I sold. The more I sold, the 
more money I made, and, of course, the more deductions there were from my 
paycheck. It was inspiring. I wanted out of the trap of being an employee so 
badly that I worked harder, not less. By 1978,I was consistently one of the top 
five salespeople in sales, often No. 1. I badly wanted out of the rat race. 
In less than three years, I was making more in my own little corporation, 
which was a real estate holding company, than I was making at Xerox. And the 
money I was making in my asset column, in my own corporation, was money working 
for me.  Not me pounding on doors selling copiers. My rich dad's advice made 
much more sense.  Soon the cash flow from my properties was so strong that my 
company bought me my first Porsche. My fellow Xerox salespeople thought I was 
spending my commissions. I wasn't. I was investing my commissions in assets. 
My money was working hard to make more money.  Each dollar in my asset 
column was a great employee, working hard to make more employees and buy the 
boss a new Porsche with before-tax dollars.  I began to work harder for Xerox. 
The plan was working, and my Porsche was the proof. 
By using the lessons I learned from my rich dad, I was able to get out of 
the "proverbial rat race" of being an employee at an early age. It was made 
possible because of the strong financial knowledge I had acquired through these 
lessons. Without this financial knowledge, which I call financial IQ, my road to 
financial independence would have been much more difficult. I now teach others 
through financial seminars in the hope that I may share my knowledge with them. 
Whenever I do my talks, I remind people that financial IQ is made up of 
knowledge from four broad areas of expertise. 
 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
No. 1 is accounting. What I call financial literacy. A vital skill if you 
want to build an empire. The more money you are responsible for, the more 
accuracy is required, or the house comes tumbling down. This is the left brain 
side, or the details. Financial literacy is the ability to read and understand 
financial statements. This ability allows you to identify the strengths and 
weaknesses of any business. 
 
No. 2 is investing. What I call the science of money making money. This 
involves strategies and formulas. This is the right brain side, or the creative 
side. 
 
No. 3 is understanding markets. The science of supply and demand. There is 
a need to know the "technical" aspects of the market, which is emotion driven; 
the Tickle Me Elmo doll during Christmas 1996 is a case of a technical or 
emotion-driven market. The other market factor is the "fundamental" or the 
economic sense of an investment. Does an investment make sense or does it not 
make sense based on the current market conditions. 
Many people think the concepts of investing and understanding the market 
are too complex for kids. They fail to see that kids know those subjects 
intuitively. For those not familiar with the Elmo doll, it was a Sesame Street 
character that was highly touted to the kids just before Christmas. Most all 
kids wanted one, and put it at the top of their Christmas list. Many parents 
wondered if the company intentionally held the product off the market, while 
continuing to advertise it for Christmas. A panic set in due to high demand and 
lack of supply. Having no dolls to buy in the stores, scalpers saw an 
opportunity to make a small fortune from desperate parents. The unlucky parents 
who did not find a doll were forced to buy another toy for Christmas. The 
incredible popularity of the Tickle Me Elmo doll made no sense to me, but it 
serves as an excellent example of supply and demand economics. The same thing 
goes on in the stock, bond, real estate and baseball-card markets. 
 
No. 4 is the law. For instance, utilizing a corporation wrapped around the 
technical skills of accounting, investing and markets can aid explosive growth. 
An individual with the knowledge of the tax advantages and protection provided 
by a corporation can get rich so much faster than someone who is an employee or 
a small-business sole proprietor. It's like the difference between someone 
walking and someone flying. The difference is profound when it comes to long-
term wealth. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
 
1. Tax advantages: A corporation can do so many things that an individual 
cannot. Like pay for expenses before it pays taxes. That is a whole area of 
expertise that is so exciting, but not necessary to get into unless you have 
sizable assets or a business. 
Employees earn and get taxed and they try to live on what is left. A 
corporation earns, spends everything it can, and is taxed on anything that is 
left. It's one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. They're 
easy to set up and are not expensive if you own investments that are producing 
good cash flow. For example; by owning your own corporation - vacations are 
board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs are company expenses. 
Health club membership is a company expense. Most restaurant meals are partial 
expenses. And on and on - but do it legally with pre-tax dollars. 
 
2. Protection from lawsuits. We live in a litigious society. Everybody 
wants a piece of your action. The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles 
such as corporations and trusts to protect their assets from creditors. When 
someone sues a wealthy individual they are often met with layers of legal 
protection, and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing. They 
control everything, but own nothing. The poor and middle class try to own 
everything and lose it to the government or to fellow citizens who like to sue 
the rich. They learned it from the Robin Hood story. Take from the rich, give to 
the poor. 
It is not the purpose of this book to go into the specifics of owning a 
corporation.  But I will say that if you own any kind of legitimate assets, I 
would consider finding out more about the benefits and protection offered by a 
corporation as soon as possible. There are many books 
written on the subject that will detail the benefits and even walk you 
through the steps necessary to set up a corporation. One book in particular, Inc. 
and Grow Rich provides a wonderful insight into the power of personal 
corporations. 
Financial IQ is actually the synergy of many skills and talents. But I 
would say it is the combination of the four technical skills listed above that 
make up basic financial intelligence. If you aspire to great wealth, it is the 
combination of these skills that will greatly amplify an individual's financial 
intelligence. 
 
In summary 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past.

6. CHAPTER SIX  
Lesson Five:The Rich Invent Money 
 
Last night, I took a break from writing and watched a TV program on the 
history of a young man named Alexander Graham Bell. Bell had just patented his 
telephone, and was having growing pains because the demand for his new invention 
was so strong. Needing a bigger company, he then went to the giant at that time, 
Western Union, and asked them if they would buy his patent and his tiny company. 
He wanted $100,000 for the whole package. The president of Western Union scoffed 
at him and turned him down, saying the price was ridiculous. The rest is history. 
A multi-billion-dollar industry emerged, and AT&T was born. 
The evening news came on right after the story of Alexander Graham Bell 
ended. On the news was a story of another downsizing at a local company. The 
workers were angry and complained that the company ownership was unfair. A 
terminated manager of about 45 years of age had his wife and two babies at the 
plant and was begging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask if they 
would reconsider his termination. He had just bought a house and was afraid of 
losing it. The camera focused in on his pleading for all the world to see. 
Needless to say, it held my attention. 
I have been teaching professionally since 1984.  It has been a great 
experience and rewarding. It is also a disturbing profession, for I have 
taught thousands of individuals and I see one thing in common in all of us, 
myself included. We all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with 
gifts. Yet, the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-doubt. 
It is not so much the lack of technical information that holds us back, but more 
the lack of self-confidence. Some are more affected than others. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Once we leave school, most of us know that it is not as much a matter of 
college degrees or good grades that count. In the real world outside of 
academics, something more than just grades is required. I have heard it called 
"guts," "chutzpah," "balls," "audacity," "bravado," "cunning," "daring," 
"tenacity" and "brilliance." This factor, whatever it is labeled, ultimately 
decides one's future much more than school grades. 
Inside each of us is one of these brave, brilliant and daring characters. 
There is also the flip side of that character: people who could get down on 
their knees and beg if necessary. After a year in Vietnam, as a Marine Corps 
pilot, I intimately got to know both of those characters-inside of me.  One is 
not better than the other. 
Yet, as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and self-doubt 
that were the greatest detractors of personal genius.  It broke my heart to see 
students know the answers, yet lack the courage to act on the answer. Often in 
the real world, it's not the smart that get ahead but the bold. 
In my personal experience, your financial genius requires both technical 
knowledge as well as courage. If fear is too strong, the genius is suppressed. 
In my classes I strongly urge students to learn to take       • risks, to be 
bold, to let their genius convert that fear into power and brilliance. It works 
for some and just terrifies others. I have come to realize that for most people, 
when it comes to the subject of money, they would rather play it safe. I have 
had to field questions such as: Why take risks? Why should I bother developing 
my financial IQ? Why should I become financially literate? 
And I answer, "Just to have more options." 
There are huge changes up head. Just as I started with the story of the 
young inventor Alexander Graham Bell, in the coming years there will be more 
people just like him. There will be a hundred people like Bill Gates and hugely 
successful companies like Microsoft created every year, all over the world. And 
there also will be many more bankruptcies, layoffs and downsizing. 
So why bother developing your financial IQ? No one can answer that but you. 
Yet, I can tell you why I myself do it.  I do it because it is the most exciting 
time to be alive. I'd rather be welcoming change than dreading change.  I'd 
rather be excited about making millions than worrying about not getting a raise. 
This period we are in now is a most exciting time, unprecedented in our world's 
history. Generations from now, people will look back at this period of time and 
remark at what an exciting era it must have been. It was the death of the old 
and birth of the new. It was full of turmoil and it was exciting. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
So why bother developing your financial IQ? Because if you do, you will 
prosper greatly. And if you don't, this period of time will be a frightening one. 
It will be a time of watching people move boldly forward while others cling to 
decaying life rings. 
Land was wealth 300 years ago. So the person who owned the land owned the 
wealth. Then, it was factories and production, and America rose to dominance. 
The industrialist owned the wealth. Today, it is information. And the person who 
has the most timely information owns the wealth. The problem is, information 
flies all around the world at the speed of light. The new wealth cannot be 
contained by boundaries and borders as land and factories were. The changes will 
be faster and more dramatic. There will be a dramatic increase in the number of 
new multimillionaires. There also will be those who are left behind. 
Today, I find so many people struggling, often working harder, simply 
because they cling to old ideas. They want things to be the way they were; they 
resist change.  I know people who are losing their jobs or their houses, and 
they blame technology or the economy or their boss. Sadly they fail to realize 
that they might be the problem. Old ideas are their biggest liability.  It is a 
liability simply because they fail to realize that while that idea or way of 
doing something was an asset yesterday, yesterday is gone. 
One afternoon I was teaching investing using a board game I had invented, 
CASHFLOW, as a teaching tool. A friend had brought someone along to attend the 
class. This friend of a friend was recently divorced, had been badly burned in 
the divorce settlement, and was now searching for some answers. Her friend 
thought the class might help. 
The game was designed to help people learn how money works. In playing the 
game, they learn about the interaction of the income statement with the balance 
sheet. They learn how "cash flows" between 
the two and how the road to wealth is through striving to increase your 
monthly cash flow from the asset column to the point that it exceeds your j 
monthly expenses. Once you accomplish this, you are able to get out of the "Rat 
Race" and out onto the "Fast Track". 
As I have said, some people hate the game, some love it, and others miss 
the point. This woman missed a valuable opportunity to learn something. In the 
opening round, she drew a "doodad" card with the boat on it. At first she was 
happy.  "Oh, I've got a boat." Then, as her friend tried to explain how the 
numbers worked on her income statement and balance sheet, she got frustrated 
because she "had never liked math. The rest of her table waited while her friend 
continued explaining the relationship between the income statement, balance 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
sheet and monthly cash flow.  Suddenly, when she realized how the numbers worked, 
it dawned on her that her boat was eating her alive. Later on in the game, she 
was also "downsized" and had a child. It was a horrible game for her. 
After the class, her friend came by and told me that she was upset. She 
had come to the class to learn about investing and did not like the idea that it 
took so long to play a silly game. 
Her friend attempted to tell her to look within herself to see if the game 
"reflected" on herself in any way. With that suggestion, the woman demanded her 
money back. She said that the very idea that a game could be a reflection of her 
was ridiculous. Her money was promptly refunded and she left. 
Since 1984, I have made millions simply by doing what the school system 
does not. In school, most teachers lecture. I hated lectures as a student; I was 
soon bored and my mind would drift. 
In 1984,I began teaching via games and simulations. I always encouraged 
adult students to look at games as reflecting back to what they know, and what 
they needed to learn. Most importantly, a game reflects back on one's behavior. 
It's an instant feedback system.  Instead of the teacher lecturing you, the game 
is feeding back a personalized lecture, custom made just for you. 
The friend of the woman who left later called to give me an update. She 
said her friend was fine and had calmed down.  In her cooling-off period, she 
could see some slight relationship between the game and her life. 
Although she and her husband did not own a boat, they did own 
everything else imaginable.  She was angry after their divorce, both 
because he had run off with a younger woman and because after twenty years of 
marriage, they had accumulated little in the way of assets. There was virtually 
nothing for them to split. Their twenty years of married life had been 
incredible fun, but all they had accumulated was a ton of doodads. 
She realized that her anger at doing the numbers-the income statement and 
balance sheet-came from her embarrassment of not understanding them. She had 
believed that finances were the man's job. She maintained the house and did the 
entertaining, and he handled the finances. She was now quite certain that in the 
last five years of their marriage, he had hidden money from her. She was angry 
at herself for not being more aware of where the money was going, as well as for 
not knowing about the other woman. 
Just like a board game, the world is always providing us with instant 
feedback. We could learn a lot if we tuned in more. One day not long ago, I 
complained to my wife that the cleaners must have shrunk my pants. My wife 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
gently smiled and poked me in the stomach to inform me that the pants had not 
shrunk, something else had expanded me! 
The game CASHFLOW was designed to give every player personal feedback. Its 
purpose is to give you options. If you draw the boat card and it puts you into 
debt, the question is, "Now what can you do?" How many different financial 
options can you come up with? That is the purpose of the game: to teach players 
to think and create new and various financial options. 
I have watched this game played by more than 1,000 people. The people who 
get out of the "Rat Race" in the game the quickest are the people who understand 
numbers and have creative financial minds. They recognize different financial 
options.  People who take the longest are people who are not familiar with 
numbers and often do not understand the power of investing. Rich people are 
often creative and take calculated risks. 
There have been people playing CASHFLOW who gain lots of money in the game, 
but they don't know what to do with it. Most of them have not been financially 
successful in real life either. Everyone else seems to be getting ahead of them, 
even though they have money. And that is true in real life. There are a lot of 
people who have a lot of money and do not get ahead financially. 
 
 
7. CHAPTER SEVEN  
Lesson Six:Work to Learn -  Don't Work for Money 
 
In 1995,1 granted an interview with a newspaper in Singapore. The young 
female reporter was on time, and the interview got under way immediately. We sat 
in the lobby of a luxurious hotel, sipping coffee and discussing the purpose of 
my visit to Singapore. I was to share the platform with Zig Ziglar. He was 
speaking on motivation, and I was speaking on "The Secrets of the Rich." 
"Someday, I would like to be a best-selling author like you," she said. I 
had seen some of the articles she had written for the paper, and I was impressed. 
She had a tough, clear style of writing. Her articles held a reader's interest. 
"You have a great style," I said in reply.  "What holds you back from 
achieving your dream?" 
"My work does not seem to go anywhere," she said quietly. "Everyone says 
that my novels are excellent, but nothing happens.  So I keep my job with the 
paper. At least it pays the bills. Do you have any suggestions?" 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"Yes, I do," I said brightly.  "A friend of mine here in Singapore runs a 
school that trains people to sell. He runs sales-training courses for many of 
the top corporations here in Singapore, and I think attending one of his courses 
would greatly enhance your career." 
She stiffened.  "Are you saying I should go to school to learn to sell?" 
I nodded. 
"You aren't serious, are you?" 
Again, I nodded.  "What is wrong with that?" I was now backpeddling. She 
was offended by something, and now I was wishing 11 had not said anything. In my 
attempt to be helpful, I found myself defending my suggestion. 
"I have a master's degree in English Literature. Why would I go to school 
to learn to be a salesperson? I am a professional. I went to school to be 
trained in a profession so I would not have to be a salesperson. I hate 
salespeople. All they want is money. So tell me why| I should study sales?" She 
was now packing her briefcase forcibly. The interview was over. 
On the coffee table sat a copy of an earlier best-selling book I wrote. I 
I picked it up as well as the notes she had jotted down on her legal pad. | "Do 
you see this?" I said pointing to her notes. 
She looked down at her notes.  "What," she said, confused. 
Again, I pointed deliberately to her notes.  On her pad she had written 
"Robert Kiyosaki, best-selling author." 
"It says 'best-selling author,' not best 'writing' author." 
Her eyes widened immediately. 
"I am a terrible writer. You are a great writer. I went to sales school. 
You have a master's degree. Put them together and you get a 'best-selling 
author' and a 'best-writing author.'" 
Anger flared from her eyes. "I'll never stoop so low as to learn how to 
sell. People like you have no business writing. I am a professionally trained 
writer and you are a salesman. It is not fair." 
The rest of her notes were put away, and she hurried out through the j, 
large glass doors into the humid Singapore morning. 
At least she gave me a fair and favorable write-up the next morning. 
The world is filled with smart, talented, educated and gifted people. We 
meet them every day. They are all around us. 
A few days ago, my car was not running well.  I pulled into a garage, and 
the young mechanic had it fixed in just a few minutes. He knew what was wrong by 
simply listening to the engine.  I was amazed. 
The sad truth is, great talent is not enough. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
 I am constantly shocked at how little talented people earn. I heard the 
other day that less than 5 percent of Americans earn more than $100,000 a year. 
I have met brilliant, highly educated people who earn less than $20,000 a year. 
A business consultant who specializes in the medical trade was telling me how 
many doctors, dentists and chiropractors struggle financially. All this time, I 
thought that when they graduated, the dollars would pour in. It was this 
business consultant who gave me the phrase, "They are one skill away from great 
wealth." 
What this phrase means is that most people need only to learn and master 
one more skill and their income would jump exponentially. I have mentioned 
before that financial intelligence is a synergy of accounting, investing, 
marketing and law. Combine those four technical skills and making money with 
money is easier. When it comes to money, the only skill most people know is to 
work hard. 
The classic example of a synergy of skills was that young writer for the 
newspaper. If she diligently learned the skills of sales and marketing, her 
income would jump dramatically. If I were her, I would take some courses in 
advertising copywriting as well as sales. Then, instead of working at the 
newspaper, I would seek a job at an advertising agency. Even if it were a cut in 
pay, she would learn how to communicate in "short cuts" that are used in 
successful advertising. She also would spend time learning public relations, an 
important skill. She would learn how to get millions in free publicity. Then, at 
night and on weekends, she could be writing her great novel. When it was 
finished, she would be better able to sell her book. Then, in a short while, she 
could be a "best-selling author." 
When I first came out with my first book If You Want To Be Rich and Happy, 
Don't Go to School? a publisher suggested I change the tide to The Economics of 
Education. I told the publisher that with a title like that, I would sell two 
books: one to my family and one to my best friend. The problem is, they would 
expect it for free. The obnoxious title If You Want To Be Rich and Happy, Don't 
Go to School? was chosen because we knew it would get tons of publicity. I am 
pro-education and believe in education reform.  Otherwise, why would I continue 
to press for changing our antiquated educational system? So I chose a title that 
would get me on more TV and radio shows, simply because I was willing to be 
controversial. Many people thought I was a fruitcake, but the book sold and sold. 
When I graduated from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in 1969, my 
educated dad was happy. Standard Oil of California had hired me for its oil-
tanker fleet. I was a third mate, and the pay was low compared with my 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
classmates, but it was OK for a first real job after college. My starting pay 
was about $42,000 a year, including overtime, and I only had , to work for seven 
months. I had five months of vacation. If I had wanted to, I could have taken 
the run to Vietnam with a subsidiary shipping company, and easily doubled my pay 
instead of taking the five J months' vacation. 
I had a great career ahead of me, yet I resigned after six months with the 
company and joined the Marine Corps to learn how to fly. My educated dad was 
devastated. Rich dad congratulated me. 
In school and in the workplace, the popular opinion is the idea of 
"specialization." That is, in order to make more money or get promoted, you need 
to "specialize." That is why medical doctors immediately begin to seek a 
specialty such as orthopedics or pediatrics. The same is true for accountants, 
architects, lawyers, pilots and others. 
My educated dad believed in the same dogma. That is why he was thrilled 
when he eventually achieved his doctorate. He often admitted   •;• that schools 
reward people who study more and more about less and less. 
Rich dad encouraged me to do exactly the opposite.  "You want to  ' know a 
little about a lot" was his suggestion. That is why for years I worked in 
different areas of his companies. For awhile, I worked in his accounting 
department. Although I would probably never have been an accountant, he wanted 
me to learn via "osmosis." Rich dad knew I would pick up "jargon" and a sense of 
what is important and what is not. I also worked as a bus boy and construction 
worker, as well as in sales, reservations and marketing.  He was "grooming" Mike 
and me. That is why he insisted we sit in on the meetings with his bankers, 
lawyers, accountants and brokers. He wanted us to know a little about every 
aspect of his empire. 
When I quit my high-paying job with Standard Oil, my educated dad had a 
heart-to-heart with me.  He was bewildered. He could not understand my decision 
to resign from a career that offered high pay, great benefits, lots of time off, 
and opportunity for promotion. When he asked me one evening, "Why did you quit?" 
I could not explain it to him, as much as I tried. My logic did not fit his 
logic. The big problem wasthat my logic was my rich dad's logic. 
Job security meant everything to my educated dad. Learning meant 
everything to my rich dad. 
Educated dad thought I went to school to learn to be a ship's officer. 
Rich dad knew that I went to school to study international trade. So as a 
student, I made cargo runs, navigating large freighters, oil tankers and 
passenger ships to the Far East and the South Pacific. Rich dad emphasized that 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
I stay in the Pacific instead of taking ships to Europe because he knew that the 
"emerging nations" were in Asia, not Europe. While most of my classmates, 
including Mike, were partying at their fraternity houses, I was studying trade, 
people, business styles and cultures in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, Hong 
Kong, Vietnam, Korea, Tahiti, Samoa and the Philippines. I also was partying, 
but it was not in any frat house. I grew up rapidly. 
Educated dad just could not understand why I decided to quit and join the 
Marine Corps. I told him I wanted to learn to fly, but really I wanted to learn 
to lead troops. Rich dad explained to me that the hardest part of running a 
company is managing people. He had spent three years in the Army; my educated 
dad was draft-exempt. Rich dad told me of the value of learning to lead men into 
dangerous situations. "Leadership is what you need to learn next," he said.  "If 
you're not a good leader, you'll get shot in the back, just like they do in 
business." 
Returning from Vietnam in 1973,1 resigned my commission, even though I 
loved flying. I found a job with Xerox Corp. I joined it for one reason, and it 
was not for the benefits. I was a shy person, and the thought of selling was the 
most frightening subject in the world. Xerox has one of the best sales-training 
programs in America. 
Rich dad was proud of me. My educated dad was ashamed. Being an 
intellectual, he thought that salespeople were below him.  I worked with Xerox 
for four years until I overcame my fear of knocking on doors and being rejected.  
Once I could consistently be in the top five in sales, I again resigned and 
moved on, leaving behind another great career with an excellent company. 
In 1977,1 formed my first company. Rich dad had groomed Mike and me to 
take over companies.  So I now had to learn to form them and put them together. 
My first product, the nylon and velcro wallet, was manufactured in the Far East 
and shipped to a warehouse in New York, near where I had gone to school.  My 
formal education was complete, and it was time to test my wings.  If I failed, I 
went broke. Rich dad 
thought it best to go broke before 30.  "You still have time to recover" 
was his advice. On the eve of my 30th birthday, my first shipment 
left    ,, 
Korea for New York. 
Today, I still do business internationally. And as my rich dad encouraged 
me to do, I keep seeking the emerging nations. Today my investment company 
invests in South America, Asia, Norway and Russia. There is an old cliche that 
goes, "Job is an acronym for 'Just Over Broke.'" And unfortunately, I would say 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
that the saying applies to millions of people. Because school does not think 
financial intelligence is an intelligence, most workers "live within their 
means." They work and they pay the bills. 
There is another horrible management theory that goes, "Workers work hard 
enough to not be fired, and owners pay just enough so that workers won't quit." 
And if you look at the pay scales of most companies, again I would say there is 
a degree of truth in that statement. 
The net result is that most workers never get ahead. They do what they've 
been taught to do: "Get a secure job." Most workers focus on working for pay and 
benefits that reward them in the short term, but is often disastrous in the long. 
Instead I recommend to young people to seek work for what they will learn, more 
than what they will earn. Look down the road at what ; skills they want to 
acquire before choosing a specific profession and before getting trapped in the 
"Rat Race." 
Once people are trapped in the lifelong process of bill paying, they 1 
become like those little hamsters running around in those little metal wheels. 
Their little furry legs are spinning furiously, the wheel is turning furiously, 
but come tomorrow morning, they'll still be in the same cage: great job. 
In the movie Jerry Maguire, starring Tom Cruise, there are many great one 
liners. Probably the most memorable is "Show me the money." But there is one 
line I thought most truthful. It comes from the scene where Tom Cruise is 
leaving the firm. He has just been fired, and he is asking the entire company 
"Who wants to come with me?" And the whole place is silent and frozen. Only one 
woman speaks up and says, "I'd like to but I'm due for a promotion in three 
months." 
That statement is probably the most truthful statement in the whole movie.  
It is the type of statement that people use to keep themselves 
  
busy working away to pay bills. I know my educated dad looked forward to 
his pay raise every year, and every year he was disappointed. So he would go 
back to school to earn more qualifications so he could get another raise, but 
again, it would be another disappointment. 
The question I often ask people is, "Where is this daily activity taking 
you?" Just like the little hamster, I wonder if people look at where their hard 
work is taking them. What does the future hold? 
Cyril Brickfield, the former executive director of The American 
Association of Retired People, reports that "private pensions are in a state of 
chaos. First of all, 50 percent of the workforce today has no pension. That 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
alone should be of great concern. And 75 to 80 percent of the other 50 percent 
have ineffective pensions that pay $55 or $150 or $300 a month." 
In his book The Retirement Myth, Craig S. Karpel writes: "I visited the 
headquarters of a major national pension consulting firm and met with a managing 
director who specializes in designing lush retirement plans for top management. 
When I asked her what people who don't have corner offices will be able to 
expect in the way of pension income, she said with a confident smile:  "The 
Silver Bullet.' 
" 'What,' I asked, 'is The Silver Bullet?' 
"She shrugged, 'If baby boomers discover they don't have enough money to 
live on when they're older, they can always blow their brains out.'" Karpel goes 
on to explain the difference between the old Defined Benefit retirement plans 
and the new 401K plans which are riskier. It is not a pretty picture for most 
people working today. And that is just for retirement. When medical fees and 
long-term nursing home care are added to the picture, the picture is frightening. 
In his 1995 book, he indicates that nursing-home fees run from $30,000 to 
$125,000 per year. He went to a clean no-frills nursing home in his area and 
found the price to be $88,000 a year in 1995. 
Already, many hospitals in countries with socialized medicine need to make 
tough decisions such as "Who will live and who will die?" They make those 
decisions purely on how much money they have and how old the patients are. If 
the patient is old, they often will give the medical care to someone younger. 
The older poor patient gets put to the back of the line.  So just as the rich 
can afford better education, the rich will be able to keep themselves alive, 
while those who have little wealth will die. 
So I wonder, are workers looking into the future or just until their next 
paycheck, never questioning where they are headed? 
When I speak to adults who want to earn more money, I always recommend the 
same thing. I suggest taking a long view of their life. Instead of simply 
working for the money and security, which I admit are important, I suggest they 
take a second job that will teach them a second skill.  Often I recommend 
joining a network marketing company, also called multilevel marketing, if they 
want to learn sales skills. Some of these companies have excellent training 
programs that help people get over their fear of failure and rejection, which 
are the main reasons people /j are unsuccessful. Education is more valuable than 
money, in the long run. 
When I offer this suggestion, I often hear in response, "Oh that is too 
much hassle," or "I only want to do what I am interested in." 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
To the statement of "It's too much of a hassle," I ask, "So you would ; 
rather work all your life giving 50 percent of what you earn to the government'" 
To the other statement-"I only do what I am interested in"-I say, "I'm not 
interested in going to the gym, but I go because I want to feel better and live 
longer." 
Unfortunately, there is some truth to the old statement "You can't teach 
an old dog new tricks." Unless a person is used to changing, it's hard to change. 
But for those of you who might be on the fence when it comes to the idea 
of working to learn something new, I offer this word of encouragement: Life is 
much like going to the gym. The most painful part is deciding to go.  Once you 
get past that, it's easy. There have been many days I have dreaded going to the 
gym, but once I am there and in motion, it is a pleasure. After the workout is 
over, I am always glad I talked myself into going. 
If you are unwilling to work to learn something new and insist on, instead, 
becoming highly specialized within your field, make sure the company you work 
for is unionized. Labor unions are designed to protect specialists. 
My educated dad, after falling from grace with the governor, became the 
head of the teachers union in Hawaii. He told me that it was the hardest job he 
ever held. My rich dad, on the other hand, spent his life doing his best to keep 
his companies from becoming unionized. He was successful. Although the unions 
came close, rich dad was always able to fight them off. 
 Personally, I take no sides because I can see the need for and the 
benefits of both sides. If you do as school recommends, become highly 
specialized, then seek union protection. For example, had I continued on with my 
flying career, I would have sought a company that had a strong pilots union. Why? 
Because my life would be dedicated to learn a skill that was valuable in only 
one industry. If I were pushed out of that industry, my life's skills would not 
be as valuable to another industry. A displaced senior pilot-with 100,000 hours 
of heavy airline transport time, earning $150,000 a year-would have a hard time 
finding an equivalent high-paying job in school teaching. The skills do not 
necessarily transfer from industry to industry, because the skills the pilots 
are paid for in the airline industry are not as important in, say, the school 
system. 
The same is true even for doctors today. With all the changes in medicine, 
many medical specialists are needing to conform to medical organizations such as 
HMO's. Schoolteachers definitely need to be union members. Today in America, the 
teachers union is the largest and the richest labor union of all. The NEA, 
National Education Association, has tremendous political clout. Teachers need 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
the protection of their union because their skills are also of limited value to 
an industry outside of education. So the rule of thumb is, "Highly specialized, 
then unionize." It's the smart thing to do. 
When I ask the classes I teach, "How many of you can cook a better 
hamburger than McDonald's?" almost all the students raise their hands. I then 
ask, "So if most of you can cook a better hamburger, how come McDonald's makes 
more money than you?" 
The answer is obvious: McDonald's is excellent at business systems. The 
reason so many talented people are poor is because they focus on building a 
better hamburger and know little to nothing about business systems. 
A friend of mine in Hawaii is a great artist. He makes a sizable amount of 
money. One day his mother's attorney called to tell him that she had left him 
$35,000. That is what was left of her estate after the attorney and the 
government took their shares.  Immediately, he saw an opportunity to increase 
his business by using some of this money to advertise. Two months later, his 
first four-color, full-page ad appeared in an expensive magazine that targeted 
the very rich. The ad ran for three months.  He received no replies from the ad, 
and all of his inheritance is now gone. He now wants to sue the magazine for 
misrepresentation. 
This is a common case of someone who can build a beautiful hamburger, but 
knows little about business. When I asked him what he learned, his only reply 
was that "advertising salespeople are crooks." I then asked him if he would be 
willing to take a course in sales and a course in direct marketing. His reply, 
"I don't have the time, and I don't want to waste my money." 
The world is filled with talented poor people. All too often, they're • 
poor or struggle financially or earn less than they are capable of, not      f 
because of what they know but because of what they do not know. They focus on 
perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of 
selling and delivering the hamburger. Maybe McDonald's does not make the best 
hamburger, but they are the best at  f selling and delivering a basic average 
burger. 
Poor dad wanted me to specialize. That was his view on how to be paid more. 
Even after being told by the governor of Hawaii that he could no longer work in 
state government, my educated dad continued to encourage me to get specialized. 
Educated dad then took up the cause of the teachers union, campaigning for 
further protection and benefits for I these highly skilled and educated 
professionals. We argued often, but I know he never agreed that 
overspecialization is what caused the need for union protection. He never 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
understood that the more specialized you become, the more you are trapped and 
dependent on that specialty.  
Rich dad advised that Mike and I "groom" ourselves. Many corporations do 
the same thing. They find a young bright student out of business school and 
begin "grooming" that person to someday take over the company.  So these bright 
young employees do not specialize in one department; they are moved from 
department to department to learn all the aspects of business systems. The rich 
often "groom" their children or the children of others.  By doing so, their 
children gain an overall knowledge of the operations of the business and how the 
various departments interrelate. 
For the World War II generation, it was considered "bad" to skip from 
company to company. Today, it is considered smart.  Since people will skip from 
company to company, rather than seek greater specialization, why not seek to 
"learn" more than "earn." In the short term, it may earn you less.  In the long 
term, it will pay off in large dividends. 
The main management skills needed for success are: 
  
1. The management of cash flow 
2. The management of systems (including yourself and time with family). 
3. The management of people. 
 
The most important specialized skills are sales and understanding 
marketing. It is the ability to sell--therefore, to communicate to another human 
being, be it a customer, employee, boss, spouse or child-that is the base skill 
of personal success. It is communication skills such as writing, speaking and 
negotiating that are crucial to a life of success. It is a skill that I work on 
constantly, attending courses or buying educational tapes to expand my knowledge. 
As I have mentioned, my educated dad worked harder and harder the more 
competent he became. He also became more trapped the more specialized he got. 
Although his salary went up, his choices diminished. Soon after he was locked 
out of government work, he found out how vulnerable he really was professionally. 
It is like professional athletes who suddenly are injured or are too old to play. 
Their once high-paying position is gone, and they have limited skills to fall 
back on. I think that is why my educated dad sided so much with unions after 
that. He realized how much a union would have benefited him. 
Rich dad encouraged Mike and me to know a little about a lot. He 
encouraged us to work with people smarter than we were and to bring smart people 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
together to work as a team. Today it would be called a synergy of professional 
specialities. 
Today, I meet ex-schoolteachers earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a 
year. They earn that much because they have specialized skills in their field as 
well as other skills. They can teach as well as sell and market. I know of no 
other skills to be more important than selling as well as marketing. The skills 
of selling and marketing are difficult for most people primarily due to their 
fear of rejection. The better you are at communicating, negotiating and handling 
your fear of rejection, the easier life is. Just as I advised that newspaper 
writer who wanted to become a "best-selling author," I advise anyone else today.  
Being technically specialized has its strengths as well as its weaknesses.  I 
have friends who are geniuses, but they cannot communicate effectively with 
other human beings and, as a result, their earnings are pitiful.  I advise them 
to just spend a year learning to sell. Even if they earn nothing, their 
communication skills will improve. And that is priceless. 
In addition to being good learners, sellers and marketers, we need to be 
good teachers as well as good students. To be truly rich, we need to be able to 
give as well as to receive. In cases of financial or professional struggle, 
there is often a lack of giving and receiving. I know many people who are poor 
because they are neither good students nor good teachers. 
Both of my dads were generous men. Both made it a practice to give first. 
Teaching was one of their ways of giving. The more they gave, the more they 
received. One glaring difference was in the giving of money. My rich dad gave 
lots of money away. He gave to his church, to charities, to his foundation. He 
knew that to receive money, you had to give money. Giving money is the secret to 
most great wealthy families. That is why there are organizations like the 
Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. These are organizations designed 
to take their wealth and increase it, as well as give it away in perpetuity. 
My educated dad always said, "When I have some extra money, I'll give it." 
The problem was, there was never any extra. So he worked harder to draw more 
money in rather than focus on the most important law of money: "Give and you 
shall receive." Instead, he believed in "Receive and then you give." 
In conclusion, I became both dads.  One part of me is a hard-core 
capitalist who loves the game of money making money. The other side is ': a 
socially responsible teacher who is deeply concerned with this ever-widening gap 
between the haves and have nots. I personally hold the archaic educational 
system primarily responsible for this growing gap. 
  

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
8. CHAPTER EIGHT 
Overcoming Obstacles 
 
Once people have studied and become financially literate, they may still 
face roadblocks to becoming financially independent. There are five main reasons 
why financially literate people may still not develop abundant asset columns. 
Asset columns that could produce large sums of cash flow. Asset columns that 
could free them to live the life they dream of, instead of working full time 
just to pay bills. The five reasons are: 
1. Fear. 
2. Cynicism. 
3. Laziness. 
4. Bad habits. 
5. Arrogance. 
 
Reason No. 1. Overcoming the fear of losing money. I have never met anyone 
who really likes losing money. And in all my years, I have never met a rich 
person who has never lost money. But I have met a lot of poor people who have 
never lost a dime. . .investing, that is. 
The fear of losing money is real. Everyone has it. Even the rich. But it's 
not fear that is the problem. It's how you handle fear. It's how you handle 
losing.  It's how you handle failure that makes the difference in one's life. 
That goes for anything in life, not just money. The primary difference between a 
rich person and a poor person is how they handle that fear. 
It's OK to be fearful. It's OK to be a coward when it comes to money. You 
can still be rich. We're all heroes at something and cowards at something else. 
My friend's wife is an emergency room nurse. When ; she sees blood, she flies 
into action. When I mention investing, she runs'j away. When I see blood, I 
don't run.  I pass out. My rich dad understood phobias about money.  "Some 
people are terrified of snakes. Some people are terrified about losing money. 
Both are phobias," he would say. So his solution to the phobia of losing money 
was this little rhyme: "If you hate risk and worry. . .start early." 
That's why banks recommend savings as a habit when you're young. J If you 
start young, it's easy to be rich. I won't go into it here, but there is a large 
difference between a person who starts saving at age 20 versus age 30. A 
staggering difference. 
It is said that one of the wonders of the world is the power of compound 
interest. The purchase of Manhattan Island is said to be one of the greatest 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
bargains of all time. New York was purchased for $24 in trinkets and beads. Yet, 
if that $24 had been invested, at 8 percent annually, that $24 would have been 
worth more than $28 trillion by 1995, Manhattan could be repurchased with money 
left over to buy much of L.A., especially at 1995's real estate prices. 
My neighbor works for a major computer company. He has been there 25 years. 
In five more years he will leave the company with $4 million in his 401k 
retirement plan. It is invested mostly in high-growth mutual funds, which he 
will convert to bonds and government securities. He'll only be 55 when he gets 
out, and he will have -a passive cash flow of over $300,000 a year, more than he 
makes from his salary.  So it can be done, even if you hate losing or hate risk. 
But you must start early and definitely set up a retirement plan, and you should 
hire a financial planner you trust to guide you before investing in anything. 
But what if you don't have much time left or would like to retire early? 
How do you handle the fear of losing money? 
My poor dad did nothing. He simply avoided the issue, refusing to discuss 
the subject. 
My rich dad, on the other hand, recommended that I think like a Texan.  "I 
like Texas and Texans," he used to say.  "In Texas, everything is bigger. When 
Texans win, they win big. And when they lose, it's spectacular." 
"They like losing?" I asked. 
"That's not what I'm saying. Nobody likes losing. Show me a happy loser, 
and I'll show you a loser," said rich dad. "It's a Texan's attitude toward risk, 
reward and failure I'm talking about. It's how they handle life. They live it 
big. Not like most of the people around here, living like roaches when it comes 
to money. Roaches terrified that someone will shine a light on them. Whimpering 
when the grocery clerk short changes them a quarter." 
Rich dad went on to explain. 
"What I like best is the Texas attitude. They're proud when they win, and 
they brag when they lose. Texans have a saying, "If you're going to go broke, go 
big. You don't want to admit you went broke over a duplex. Most people around 
here are so afraid of losing, they don't have a duplex to go broke with." 
He constantly told Mike and me that the greatest reason for lack of 
financial success was because most people played it too safe.  "People are so 
afraid of losing that they lose" were his words. 
Fran Tarkenton, a one-time great NFL quarterback, says it still another 
way: "Winning means being unafraid to lose." 
In my own life, I've noticed that winning usually follows losing. Before I 
finally learned to ride a bike, I first fell down many times. I've never met a 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
golfer who has never lost a golf ball. I've never met people who have fallen in 
love who have never had their heart broken. And I've never met someone rich who 
has never lost money. 
So for most people, the reason they don't win financially is because the 
pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich.   Another saying 
in Texas is, "Everyone wants to go to Heaven, but no one wants to die." Most 
people dream of being rich, but are terrified of losing money.  So they never 
get to Heaven. 
Rich dad used to tell Mike and me stories about his trips to Texas. "If 
you really want to learn the attitude of how to handle risk, losing and failure, 
go to San Antonio and visit the Alamo. The Alamo is a great story of brave 
people who chose to fight, knowing there was no hope of success against 
overwhelming odds. They chose to die instead of surrendering. It's an inspiring 
story worthy of study; nonetheless, it's still a tragic military defeat. They 
got their butts kicked. A failure if you will. They lost.  So how do Texans 
handle failure? They still shout, 'Remember the Alamo!'" 
Mike and I heard this story a lot. He always told us this story when f he 
was about to go into a big deal and he was nervous. After he had done all his 
due diligence and now it was put up or shut up, he told us this story.  Every 
time he was afraid of making a mistake, or losing money, he told us this story. 
It gave him strength, for it reminded him that he could always turn a financial 
loss into a financial win. Rich dad   I knew that failure would only make him 
stronger and smarter. It's not that! he wanted to lose; he just knew who he was 
and how he would take a loss. He would take a loss and make it a win. That's 
what made him a winner and others losers. It gave him the courage to cross the 
line when others backed out. "That's why I like Texans so much. They took a 
great failure and turned it into a tourist destination that makes them 
millions." 
But probably his words that mean the most to me today are these: "Texans 
don't bury their failures. They get inspired by them. They take i their failures 
and turn them into rallying cries. Failure inspires Texans to ' become winners. 
But that formula is not just the formula for Texans. It j is the formula for all 
winners." 
Just as I also said that falling off my bike was part of learning to ride. 
I remember falling off only made me more determined to learn to ride. Not less. 
I also said that I have never met a golfer who has never lost a ball. To be a 
top professional golfer, losing a ball or a tournament only inspires golfers to 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
be better, to practice harder, to study more. That's what makes them better. For 
winners, losing inspires them. For losers, losing defeats them. 
Quoting John D. Rockefeller, "I always tried to turn every disaster ' into 
an opportunity." 
And being Japanese-American, I can say this. Many people say that Pearl 
Harbor was an American mistake. I say it was a Japanese mistake. From the movie 
Tora, Tora, Tom, a somber Japanese admiral says to his cheering subordinates, "I 
am afraid we have awakened a sleeping giant." "Remember Pearl Harbor" became a 
rallying cry. It turned one of America's greatest losses into the reason to win. 
This great defeat gave America strength, and America soon emerged as a world 
power. 
Failure inspires winners. And failure defeats losers. It is the biggest 
secret of winners.  It's the secret that losers do not know. The greatest secret 
of winners is that failure inspires winning; thus, they're not afraid of losing.  
Repeating Fran Tarkenton's quote, "Winning means being unafraid to lose." People 
like Fran Tarkenton are not afraid of losing because they know who they are. 
They hate losing, so they know that losing will only inspire them to become 
better. There is a big difference between hating losing and being afraid to lose. 
Most people are so afraid of losing money that they lose. They go broke over a 
duplex. Financially they play life too safe and too small. They buy big houses 
and big cars, but not big investments. The main reason that over 90 percent of 
the American public struggles financially is because they play not to lose. They 
don't play to win. 
They go to their financial planners or accountants or stockbrokers and buy 
a balanced portfolio. Most have lots of cash in CDs, low-yield bonds, mutual 
funds that can be traded within a mutual-fund family, and a few individual 
stocks. It is a safe and sensible portfolio. But it is not a winning portfolio. 
It is a portfolio of someone playing not to lose. 
Don't get me wrong. It's probably a better portfolio than more than 70 
percent of the population, and that's frightening. Because a safe portfolio is a 
lot better than no portfolio. It's a great portfolio for someone who loves 
safely. But playing it safe and going "balanced" on your investment portfolio is 
not the way successful investors play the game. If you have little money and you 
want to be rich, you must first be "focused," not "balanced." If you look at 
anyone successful, at the start they were not balanced. Balanced people go 
nowhere. They stay in one spot. To make progress, you must first go unbalanced. 
Just look at how you make progress walking. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Thomas Edison was not balanced. He was focused. Bill Gates was not 
balanced. He was focused. Donald Trump is focused. George Soros is focused. 
George Patton did not take his tanks wide. He focused them and blew through the 
weak spots in the German line. The French went wide with the Maginot Line, and 
you know what happened to them. 
If you have any desire of being rich, you must focus. Put a lot of your 
eggs in a few baskets. Do not do what poor and middle class people do: put their 
few eggs in many baskets. 
If you hate losing, play it safe. If losing makes you weak, play it safe. 
Go with balanced investments. If you're over 25 years old and are terrified of 
taking risks, don't change. Play it safe, but start early.  Start accumulating 
your nest egg early because it will take time. 
But if you have dreams of freedom-of getting out of the rat race- the 
first question to ask yourself is, "How do I respond to failure?" If failure 
inspires you to win, maybe you should go for it-but only maybe. If failure makes 
you weak or causes you to throw temper tantrums-like spoiled brats who call an 
attorney to file a lawsuit every time something does not go their way-then play 
it safe. Keep your daytime job. Or buy bonds or mutual funds. But remember, 
there is risk in those financial instruments also, even though they are safer. 
I say all this, mentioning Texas and Fran Tarkenton, because stacking the 
asset column is easy. It's really a low-aptitude game. It doesn't take much 
education. Fifth-grade math will do. But staking the asset column 'J is a high-
attitude game. It takes guts, patience and a great attitude toward failure. 
Losers avoid failing. And failure turns losers into winners.'' Just remember the 
Alamo. 
Reason No. 2. Overcoming cynicism. "The sky is falling. The sky is 
falling." Most of us know the story of "Chicken Little," who ran around warning 
the barnyard of impending doom. We all know people who are that way. But we all 
have a "Chicken Little" inside each of us. 
And as I stated earlier, the cynic is really a little chicken. We all get 
a little chicken when fear and doubt cloud our thoughts. 
All of us have doubts.  "I'm not smart." "I'm not good enough." "So '$ and 
so is better than me." Or our doubts often paralyze us. We play the. | "What 
if?" game.  "What if the economy crashes right after I invest?" Or "What if I 
lose control and I can't pay the money back?" "What if things don't go as I 
planned?" Or we have friends or loved ones who will remind us of our 
shortcomings regardless of whether we ask. They often say, "What makes you think 
you can do that?" Or "If it's such a good idea, how come someone else hasn't 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
done it?" Or "That will never work. You don't know what you're talking about." 
These words of doubt often get so loud that we fail to act. A horrible feeling 
builds in our stomach. Sometimes we can't sleep. We fail to move forward.  So we 
stay with what is safe and opportunities pass us by. We watch life passing by as 
we sit immobilized with a cold knot in our body. We have all felt this at one 
time in our lives, some more than others. 
Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan mutual fund fame refers to warnings about 
the sky falling as "noise," and we all hear it. 
"Noise" is either created inside our heads or comes from outside. Often 
from friends, family, co-workers and the media.  Lynch recalls the time during 
the 1950s when the threat of nuclear war was so prevalent in the news that 
people began building fallout shelters and storing food and water. If they had 
invested that money wisely in the market, instead of building a fallout shelter, 
they'd probably be financially independent today. 
When the riots broke out in Los Angeles a few years ago, gun sales went up 
all over the country. A person dies from rare hamburger meat in Washington State 
and the Arizona Health Department orders restaurants to have all beef cooked 
well-done. A drug company runs a national TV commercial showing people catching 
the flu. The ad runs in February. Colds go up as well as sales of their cold 
medicine. 
Most people are poor because when it comes to investing, the world is 
filled with Chicken Littles running around yelling, "The sky is falling. The sky 
is falling." And Chicken Littles are effective because everyone of us is a 
little chicken. It often takes great courage to not let rumors and talk of doom 
and gloom affect your doubts and fears. 
In 1992, a friend named Richard came from Boston to visit my wife and me 
in Phoenix. He was impressed with what we had done through stocks and real 
estate. The prices of real estate in Phoenix were depressed. We spent two days 
with him showing him what we thought were excellent opportunities for cash flow 
and capital appreciation. 
My wife and I are not real estate agents. We are strictly investors. After 
identifying a unit in a resort community, we called an agent who sold it to him 
that afternoon. The price was a mere $42,000 for a two-bedroom townhome.  
Similar units were going for $65,000. He had found a bargain. Excited, he bought 
it and returned to Boston. 
Two weeks later, the agent called to say that our friend had backed out. I 
called immediately to find out why. All he said was that he talked to his 
neighbor, and his neighbor told him it was a bad deal. He was paying too much. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
I asked Richard if his neighbor was an investor. Richard said "no." When I 
asked why he listened to him, Richard got defensive and simply said he wanted to 
keep looking. 
The real estate market in Phoenix turned, and by 1994, that little unit 
was renting for $1,000 a month-$2,500 in the peak winter months. The unit was 
worth $95,000 in 1995. All Richard had to put down was $5,000 and he would have 
had a start at getting out of the rat race. Today, he still has done nothing. 
And the bargains in Phoenix are still here; you just have to look a lot harder. 
Richard's backing out did not surprise me.  It's called "buyer's remorse," 
and it affects all of us. It's those doubts that get us. The little 1 chicken 
won, and a chance at freedom was lost. 
In another example, I hold a small portion of my assets in tax lien 
certificates instead of CDs. I earn 16 percent per year on my money, which 
certainly beats the 5 percent the bank offers. The certificates are secured by 
real estate and enforced by state law, which is also better than most banks. The 
formula they're bought on makes them safe. They just lack liquidity. So I look 
at them as 2 to 7-year CDs. Almost every time I tell someone, especially if they 
have money in CDs, that I hold my money this way, they will tell me it's risky. 
They tell me why I should not do it. When I ask them where they get their 
information, they say from a friend or an investment magazine. They've never 
done it, and they're telling someone who's doing it why they shouldn't. The 
lowest I yield I look for is 16 percent, but people who are filled with doubt 
are willing to accept 5 percent. Doubt is expensive. 
My point is that it's those doubts and cynicism that keep most people? 
poor and playing it safe. The real world is simply waiting for you to get rich.  
Only a person's doubts keep them poor. As I said, getting out of the rat race is 
technically easy. It doesn't take much education, but those doubts are cripplers 
for most people. 
"Cynics never win," said rich dad. "Unchecked doubt and fear creates i a 
cynic. Cynics criticize, and winners analyze" was another of his favorite 
sayings. Rich dad explained that criticism blinded while analysis opened -< eyes. 
Analysis allowed winners to see that critics were blind, and to see 
opportunities that everyone else missed. And finding what people miss is | key 
to any success. 
Real estate is a powerful investment tool for anyone seeking financial 
independence or freedom. It is a unique investment tool. Yet, every time I 
mention real estate as a vehicle, I often hear, "I don't want to fix toilets." 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
That's what Peter Lynch calls "noise." That's what my rich dad would say is the 
cynic talking. Someone who criticizes and does not 
analyze. Someone who lets their doubts and fears close their mind instead 
of open their eyes." 
So when someone says, "I don't want to fix toilets," I want to fire back, 
"What makes you think I want to?" They're saying a toilet is more important than 
what they want. I talk about freedom from the rat race, and they focus on 
toilets. That is the thought pattern that keeps most people poor. They criticize 
instead of analyze. 
 " 'I don't wants' hold the key to your success," rich dad would say. 
Because I, too, do not want to fix toilets, I shop hard for a property 
manager who does fix toilets. And by finding a great property manager who runs 
houses or apartments, well, my cash flow goes up. But more importantly a great 
property manager allows me to buy a lot more real estate since I don't have to 
fix toilets. A great property manager is key to success in real estate. Finding 
a good manager is more important to me than the real estate. A great property 
manager often hears of great deals before real estate agents do, which makes 
them even more valuable. 
That is what rich dad meant by " 'I don't wants' hold the key to your 
success." Because I do not want to fix toilets either, I figured out how to buy 
more real estate and expedite my getting out of the rat race. The people who 
continue to say "I don't want to fix toilets" often deny themselves the use of 
this powerful investment vehicle. Toilets are more important than their freedom. 
In the stock market, I often hear people say, "I don't want to lose 
money." Well, what makes them think I or anyone else likes losing money? They 
don't make money because they chose to not lose money. Instead of analyzing, 
they close their minds to another powerful investment vehicle, the stock market. 
In December 1996,1 was riding with a friend past our neighborhood gas 
station. He looked up and saw that the price of oil was going up. My friend is a 
worry wart or a "Chicken Little." To him, the sky is always going to fall, and 
it usually does, on him. 
When we got home, he showed me all the stats as to why the price of oil 
was going to go up over the next few years. Statistics I had never seen before, 
even though I already owned a substantial share block of an existing oil company. 
With that information, I immediately began looking for and found a new 
undervalued oil company that was about to find some oil deposits. My broker was 
excited about this new company, and I bought 15,000 shares for 65 cents per 
share. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
In February 1997, this same friend and I drove by the same gas station, 
and sure enough, the price per gallon had gone up nearly 15 percent. Again, the 
"Chicken Little" worried and complained.  I smiled because in January 1997, that 
little oil company hit oil and those 15,000 shares went up to more than $3 per 
share since he had first given me the tip. And the price of gas will continue to 
go up if what my friend says is true. 
Instead of analyzing, their little chicken closes their mind. If most 
people understood how a "stop" worked in stock-market investing, there would be 
more people -investing to win instead of investing not to lose. A "stop" is 
simply a computer command that sells your stock automatically if the price 
begins to drop, helping to minimize your losses and maximize some gains. It's a 
great tool for those who are terrified of losing. 
So whenever I hear people focusing on their "I don't wants," rather than 
what they do want, I know the "noise" in their head must be loud. Chicken Little 
has taken over their brain and is yelling, "The sky is falling and toilets are 
breaking." So they avoid their "don't wants," but they pay a huge price. They 
may never get what they want in life. 
Rich dad gave me a way of looking at Chicken Little.  "Just do what 
Colonel Sanders did." At the age of 66, he lost his business and began to live 
on his Social Security check. It wasn't enough. He went around, the country 
selling his recipe for fried chicken. He was turned down 1,009 times before 
someone said "yes." And he went on to become a 
multimillionaire at an age when most people are quitting.  "He was a brave 
and tenacious man," rich dad said of Harlan Sanders. 
So when you're in doubt and feeling a little afraid, just do what Col. 
Sanders did to his little chicken. He fried it. 
Reason No. 3. Laziness. Busy people are often the most lazy. We have all 
heard stories of a businessman who works hard to earn money. He works hard to be 
a good provider for his wife and children. He spends long hours at the office 
and brings work home on weekends. One day he comes home to an empty house. His 
wife has left with the kids. He knew he and his wife had problems, but rather 
than work to make the relationship strong, he stayed busy at work. Dismayed, his  
performance at work slips and he loses his job. 
Today, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their wealth. 
And there are people too busy to take care of their health. The cause is the 
same. They're busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding something they do 
not want to face. Nobody has to tell them.  Deep down they know. In fact, if you 
remind them, they often respond with anger or irritation. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
If they aren't busy at work or with the kids, they're often busy watching 
TV, fishing, playing golf or shopping. Yet, deep down they know they are 
avoiding something important.  That's the most common form of laziness. Laziness 
by staying busy. 
So what is the cure for laziness? The answer is a little greed. 
For many of us, we were raised thinking of greed or desire as bad. "Greedy 
people are bad people," my mom use to say. Yet, we all have inside of us this 
yearning to have nice things, new things or exciting things. So to keep that 
emotion of desire under control, often parents found ways of suppressing that 
desire with guilt. 
"You only think about yourself. Don't you know you have brothers and 
sisters?" was one of my mom's favorites. Or "You want me to buy you what?" was a 
favorite of my dad.  "Do you think we're made of money?   Do you think money 
grows on trees? We're not rich people, you know." 
It wasn't so much the words but the angry guilt-trip that went with the 
words that got to me. 
Or the reverse guilt-trip was the "I'm sacrificing my life to buy this for 
you. I'm buying this for you because I never had this advantage when I was a 
kid." I have a neighbor who is stone broke, but can't park his car in his garage. 
The garage is filled with toys for his kids. Those spoiled brats get everything 
they ask for.  "I don't want them to know the feeling of want" are his everyday 
words. He has nothing set aside for their college or his retirement, but his 
kids have every toy ever made. He recently got a new credit card in the mail and 
took his kids to visit Las Vegas.  "I'm doing it for the kids," he said with 
great sacrifice. 
Rich dad forbade the words "I can't afford it." 
In my real home, that's all I heard. Instead, rich dad required his 
children to say, "How can I afford it?" His reasoning, the words "I can't afford 
it" shut down your brain. It didn't have to think anymore. "How can I afford 
it'" opened up the brain. Forced it to think and search for answers. 
But most importantly, he felt the words "I can't afford it" were a lie. 
And the human spirit knew it.  "The human spirit is very, very, powerful," he 
would say.  "It knows it can do anything." By having a lazy mind that says, "I 
can't afford it," a war breaks out inside you. Your spirit is angry, and your 
lazy mind must defend its lie. The spirit is screaming, "Come on. Let's go to 
the gym and work out." And the lazy mind says, "But I'm tired. I worked really 
hard today." Or the human spirit says, "I'm sick and tired of being poor.  Let's 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
get out there and get rich." To which the lazy mind says, "Rich people are 
greedy.  Besides it's too much bother. 
 It's not safe. I might lose money.  I'm working hard enough as it is. 
I've got too much to do at work anyway. Look at what I have to do tonight. My 
boss wants it finished by the morning." 
"I can't afford it" also brings up sadness. A helplessness that leads to ' 
despondency and often depression. "Apathy" is another word. "How can I afford 
it?" opens up possibilities, excitement and dreams. So rich dad , was not so 
concerned about what you wanted to buy, but that "How can 'f j I afford it?" 
created a stronger mind and a dynamic spirit. 
Thus, he rarely gave Mike or me anything. Instead he would ask, "How can 
you afford it?" and that included college, which we paid for ourselves. It was 
not the goal but the process of attaining the goal we desired that he wanted us 
to learn. The problem I sense today is that there are millions of people who 
feel guilty about their greed. It's an old conditioning from their childhood. 
Their desire to have the finer things that life offers. Most have been 
conditioned subconsciously to say, "You can't have that," or   ; 
"You'll never afford that." 
When I decided to exit the rat race, it was simply a question.  "How can I 
afford to never work again?" And my mind began to kick out answers and solutions. 
The hardest part was fighting my real parents' dogma of "We can't afford that." 
Or "Stop thinking only about yourself." Or "Why don't you think about others?" 
and other such words designed to instill guilt to suppress my greed. 
So how do you beat laziness? The answer is a little greed.  It's that 
radio station WII-FM, which stands for "What's In It-For Me?" A person needs to 
sit down and ask, "What's in it for me if I'm healthy, sexy and good looking?"  
Or "What would my life be like if I never had to work again?" Or "What would I 
do if I had all the money I needed?" Without that little greed, the desire to 
have something better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because we all 
desire a better life.  New inventions are made because we desire something 
better. We go to school and study hard because we want something better.  So 
whenever you find yourself avoiding something you know you should be doing, then 
the only thing to ask yourself is "What's in it for me?" Be a little greedy. 
It's the best cure for laziness. 
Too much greed, however, as anything in excess can be, is not good. But 
just remember what Michael Douglas said in the movie Wall Street. "Greed is 
good." Rich dad said it differently: "Guilt is worse than greed. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
For guilt robs the body of its soul." And to me, Eleanor Roosevelt said it 
best: "Do what you feel in your heart to be right-for you'll be criticized 
anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't." 
Reason No. 4. Habits. Our lives are a reflection of our habits more than 
our education. After seeing the movie Conan, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, a 
friend said, "I'd love to have a body like Schwarzenegger." Most of the guys 
nodded in agreement. 
"I even heard he was really puny and skinny at one time," another friend 
added. 
"Yeah, I heard that too," another one added.  "I heard he has a habit of 
working out almost every day in the gym." 
"Yeah, I'll bet he has to." 
"Nah," said the group cynic.  "I'll bet he was born that way. Besides, 
let's stop talking about Arnold and get some beers." 
This is an example of habits controlling behavior. I remember asking my 
rich dad about the habits of the rich. Instead of answering me outright, he 
wanted me to learn through example, as usual. 
"When does your dad pay his bills?" rich dad asked. 
"The first of the month," I said. 
"Does he have anything left over?" he asked. 
"Very little," I said. 
"That's the main reason he struggles," said rich dad.  "He has bad 
habits." 
"Your dad pays everyone else first. He pays himself last, but only if he 
has anything left over." 
"Which he usually doesn't," I said. "But he has to pay his bills, doesn't 
he? You're saying he shouldn't pay his bills?" 
"Of course not," said rich dad.  "I firmly believe in paying my bills on 
time. I just pay myself first.  Before I pay even the government." 
"But what happens if you don't have enough money?" I asked. "What do you 
do then?" 
"The same," said rich dad.  "I still pay myself first. Even if I'm short 
of money. My asset column is far more important to me than the government." 
"But," I said.  "Don't they come after you?" 
"Yes, if you don't pay," said rich dad.  "Look, I did not say not to pay. 
I just said I pay myself first, even if I'm short of money." 
"But," I replied.  "How do you do that'" 
"It's not how. The question is 'Why,'" rich dad said. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
"OK, why?" 
"Motivation," said rich dad "Who do you think will complain louder if I 
don't pay them-me or my creditors?" 
"Your creditors will definitely scream louder than you," I said, 
responding to the obvious. "You wouldn't say anything if you didn't pay 
yourself." 
"So you see, after paying myself, the pressure to pay my taxes and the 
other creditors is so great that it forces me to seek other forms of income. The 
pressure to pay becomes my motivation. I've worked extra jobs, started other 
companies, traded in the stock market, anything just to make sure those guys 
don't start yelling at me. That pressure made me work harder, forced me to think, 
and all in all made me smarter and more active when it comes to money. If I had 
paid myself last, I would have felt no pressure, but I'd be broke." 
"So it is the fear of the government or other people you owe money I to 
that motivates you?" 
"That's right," said rich dad. "You see, government bill collectors are 
big bullies. So are bill collectors in general. Most people give into these 
bullies. They pay them and never pay themselves. You know the story of the 96-
pound weakling who gets sand kicked in his face?" 
I nodded.  "I see that ad for weightlifting and bodybuilding lessons in 
the comic books all the time." 
"Well, most people let the bullies kick sand in their faces. I decided to 
use the fear of the bully to make me stronger. Others get weaker. Forcing myself 
to think about how to make extra money is like going to the gym and working out 
with weights. The more I work my mental money muscles out, the stronger I get. 
Now, I'm not afraid of those bullies. 
I liked what rich dad was saying.  "So if I pay myself first, I get 
financially stronger, mentally and fiscally." 
Rich dad nodded. 
"And if I pay myself last, or not at all, I get weaker. So people like 
bosses, managers, tax collectors, bill collectors and landlords push me around 
all my life. Just because I don't have good money habits." 
Rich dad nodded.  "Just like the 96-pound weakling." 
Reason No. 5. Arrogance. Arrogance is ego plus ignorance. I     "What I 
know makes me money. What I don't know loses me money. Every time I have been 
arrogant, I have lost money. Because when I'm arrogant, I truly believe that 
what I don't know is not important," rich dad would often tell me. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
I have found that many people use arrogance to try to hide their own 
ignorance. It often happens when I am discussing financial statements with 
accountants or even other investors. 
They try to bluster their way through the discussion. It is clear to me 
that they don't know what they're talking about. They're not lying, but they are 
not telling the truth. 
There are many people in the world of money, finances and investments who 
have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. Most people in the money 
industry are just spouting off sales pitches like used-car salesmen. 
When you know you are ignorant in a subject, start educating yourself by 
finding an expert in the field or find a book on the subject. 
 
9. CHAPTER NINE 
Getting Started 
 
I wish I could say acquiring wealth was easy for me, but it wasn't. 
So in response to the question "How do I start?" I offer the thought 
process I go through on a day-by-day basis. It really is easy to find great 
deals. I promise you that. It's just like riding a bike. After a little wobbling, 
it's a piece of cake. But when it comes to money, it's the determination to get 
through the wobbling that's a personal thing. 
To find million-dollar "deals of a lifetime" requires us to call on our 
financial genius. I believe that each of us has a financial genius within us. 
The problem is, our financial genius lies asleep, waiting to be called upon. It 
lies asleep because our culture has educated us into believing that the love of 
money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a profession so we 
can work for money, but failed to teach us how to have money work for us. It 
taught us not to worry about our financial future, our company or the government 
would take care of us when our working days are over. However, it is our 
children, educated in the same school system, who will end up paying for it. The 
message is still to work hard, earn money and spend it, and when we run short, 
we can always borrow more. 
Unfortunately, 90 percent of the Western world subscribes to the above 
dogma, simply because it's easier to find a job and work for money. If you are 
not one of the masses, I offer you the following ten steps to awaken your 
financial genius. I simply offer you the steps I have personally followed.  If 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
you want to follow some of them, great. If you don't, make up your own. Your 
financial genius is smart enough to develop its own list. 
While in Peru, with a gold miner of 45 years, I asked him how he was so 
confident about finding a gold mine. He replied, "There is gold everywhere. Most 
people are not trained to see it." 
And I would say that is true. In real estate, I can go out and in a day 
come up with four or five great potential deals, while the average person will 
go out and find nothing.  Even looking in the same neighborhood. The reason is 
they have not taken the time to develop their financial genius. 
I offer you the following ten steps as a process to develop your God-given 
powers. Powers only you have control over. 
 
1.  I NEED A REASON GREATER THAN REALITY: The power of spirit.  If you ask 
most people if they would like to be rich or financially free, they would say 
"yes." But then reality sets in. The road seems too long with too many hills to 
climb. It's easier to     just work for money and hand the excess over to your 
broker. I once met a young woman who had dreams of swimming for the U.S Olympic 
team. The reality was, she had to get up every morning at 4 a.m. to swim for 
three hours before going to school. She did not party with her friends on 
Saturday night.  She had to study and keep her grades up, just like everyone 
else. 
When I asked her what compelled her with such super-human ambition and 
sacrifice, she simply said, "I do it for myself and the people I love. It's love 
that gets me over the hurdles and sacrifices." 
A reason or a purpose is a combination of "wants" and "don't wants." When 
people ask me what my reason for wanting to be rich is, it is a combination of 
deep emotional "wants" and "don't wants." 
I will list a few. First the "don't wants," for they create the "wants." I 
don't want to work all my life.  I don't want what my parents aspired for, which 
was job security and a house in the suburbs.  I don't like being an employee. I 
hated that my dad always missed my football games because he was so busy working 
on his career.  I hated it when my dad worked hard all his life and the 
government took most of what he worked for at his death. He could not even pass 
on what he worked so hard for when he died. The rich don't do that. They work 
hard and pass it on to their children. 
Now the wants.  I want to be free to travel the world and live in the 
lifestyle I love. I want to be young when I do this. I want to simply be free. I 
want control over my time and my life.  I want money to work for me. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Those are my deep-seated, emotional reasons. What are yours? If they are 
not strong enough, then the reality of the road ahead may be greater than your 
reasons. I have lost money and been set back many times, but it was the deep 
emotional reasons that kept me standing up and going forward. I wanted to be 
free by age 40, but it took me until I was 4? with many learning experiences 
along the way. 
As I said, I wish I could say it was easy. It wasn't, but it wasn't hard 
either. But without a strong reason or purpose, anything in life is hard. 
 
IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A STRONG REASON, THERE IS NO SENSE READING FURTHER. IT 
WILL SOUND LIKE TOO MUCH WORK. 
 
2. I CHOOSE DAILY: The power of choice. That is the main reason people 
want to live in a free country. We want the power to choose. 
Financially, with every dollar we get in our hands, we hold the power to 
choose our future to be rich, poor or middle class.  Our spending habits reflect 
who we are.  Poor people simply have poor spending habits. 
The benefit I had as a boy was that I loved playing Monopoly constantly.  
Nobody told me Monopoly was only for kids, so I just kept playing the game as an 
adult. I also had a rich dad who pointed out to me the difference between an 
asset and a liability.  So a long time ago, as a little boy, I chose to be rich, 
and I knew that all I had to do was learn to acquire assets, real assets. My 
best friend, Mike, had an asset column handed to him, but he still had to choose 
to learn to keep it. Many rich families lose their assets in the next generation 
simply because there was no one trained to be a good steward over their assets. 
Most people choose not to be rich. For 90 percent of the population, being 
rich is "too much of a hassle."  So they invent sayings that go, "I'm not 
interested in money."  Or "I'll never be rich." Or "I don't have to worry, I'm 
still young."  Or "When I make some money, then I'll think about my future."  Or 
"My husband/wife handles the finances." The problem with those statements is 
they rob the person who chooses to 
  
think such thoughts of two things: one is time, which is your most 
precious asset, and two is learning. Just because you have no money, should not 
be an excuse to not learn. But that is a choice we all make daily, the choice of 
what we do with our time, our money and what we put in our heads. That is the 
power of choice. All of us have choice. I just choose to be rich, and I make 
that choice every day. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
INVEST FIRST IN EDUCATION:  In reality, the only real asset you have is 
your mind, the most powerful tool we have dominion over. Just as I said about 
the power of choice, each of us has the choice of what we put in our brain once 
we're old enough. You can watch MTV all day, or read golf magazines, or go to 
ceramics class or a class on financial planning. You choose. Most people simply 
buy investments rather than  
first invest in learning about investing. 
A friend of mine, who is a rich woman, recently had her apartment 
burglarized. The thieves took her TV and VCR and left all the books she reads. 
And we all have that choice. Again, 90 percent of the population buys TV sets 
and only about 10 percent buy books on business or tapes on investments. 
So what do I do? I go to seminars. I like it when they are at least two 
days long because I like to immerse myself in a subject. In 1973, I was watching 
TV and this guy came on advertising a three-day seminar on how to buy real 
estate for nothing down. I spent $385 and that course has made me at least $2 
million, if not more. But more importantly, it bought me life. I don't have to 
work for the rest of my life because of that one course. I go to at least two 
such courses every year. 
I love audio tapes. The reason: I can rewind quickly. I was listening to a 
tape by Peter Lynch, and he said something I completely disagreed with.  Instead 
of becoming arrogant and critical, I simply pushed "rewind" and I listened to 
that five-minute stretch of tape at least twenty times. Possibly more. But 
suddenly, by keeping my mind open, I understood why he said what he said. It was 
like magic. I felt like I had a window into the mind of one of the greatest 
investors of our time. I gained tremendous depth and insight into the vast 
resources of his education and experience. 
The net result: I still have the old way I used to think, and I have 
Peter's way of looking at the same problem or situation. I have two thoughts 
instead of one.  One more way to analyze a problem or trend, and that is 
priceless. Today, I often say, "How would Peter Lynch do this, or Donald Trump 
or Warren Buffett or George Soros?" The only way I can access their vast mental 
power is to be humble enough to read or listen to what they have to say. 
Arrogant or critical people are often people with low self-esteem who are afraid 
of taking risks. You see, if you learn something new, you are then required to 
make mistakes in order to fully understand what you have learned. 
If you have read this far, arrogance is not one of your problems. Arrogant 
people rarely read or buy tapes. Why should they? They are the center of the 
universe. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
There are so many "intelligent" people who argue or defend when a new idea 
clashes with the way they think. In this case, their so-called "intelligence" 
combined with "arrogance" equals "ignorance". Each of us knows people who are 
highly educated, or believe they are smart, but their balance sheet paints a 
different picture. A truly intelligent person welcomes new ideas, for new ideas 
can add to the synergy of other accumulated ideas. Listening is more important 
than talking. If that was not true, God would not have given us two ears and 
only one mouth. Too many people think with their mouth instead of listening to 
absorb new ideas and possibilities. They argue instead of asking questions. 
I take a long view on my wealth. I do not subscribe to the "Get rich 
quick" mentality most lottery players or casino gamblers have. I may go in and 
out of stocks, but I am long on education. If you want to fly an airplane, I 
advise taking lessons first. I am always shocked at people who buy stocks or 
real estate, but never invest in their greatest asset, their mind. Just because 
you bought a house or two does not make you an expert at real estate. 
 
3. CHOOSE FRIENDS CAREFULLY: The power of association. First of all, I do 
not choose my friends by their financial statements. I have friends who have 
actually taken the vow of poverty as well as friends who earn millions every 
year. The point is I learn from all of them, and I consciously make the effort 
to learn from them. 
Now I will admit that there are people I have actually sought out because 
they had money. But I was not after their money; I was seeking their knowledge. 
In some cases, these people who had money have become dear friends, but not all. 
But there is one distinction that I would like to point out. I've noticed 
that my friends with money talk about money. And I do not mean brag. They're 
interested in the subject.  So I learn from them, and they learn from me. My 
friends, whom I know are in dire straits financially, do not like talking about 
money, business or investing. They often think it rude or unintellectual. So I 
also learn from my friends who struggle financially. I find out what not to do. 
I have several friends who have generated over a billion dollars in their 
short lifetimes. The three of them report the same phenomenon: Their friends who 
have no money have never come to them to ask them how they did it. But they do 
come asking for one of two things, or both: 1. a loan, or 2. a job. 
 
A WARNING: Don't listen to poor or frightened people. I have such friends, 
and I love them dearly, but they are the "Chicken Littles" of life.  When it 
comes to money, especially investments, "The sky is always falling." They can 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
always tell you why something won't work. The problem is, people listen to them, 
but people who blindly accept doom-and-gloom information are also "Chicken 
Littles." As that old saying goes, "Chickens of a feather agree together." 
If you watch CNBC, which is a goldmine of investment information, they 
often have a panel of so-called "experts." One expert will say the market is 
going to crash, and the other will say it's going to boom. If you're smart, you 
listen to both. Keep your mind open because both have valid points. 
Unfortunately, most poor people listen to "Chicken Little." 
I have had more close friends try to talk me out of a deal or an 
investment. A few years ago, a friend told me he was excited because he found a 
6 percent certificate of deposit. I told him I earn 16 percent from the state 
government. The next day he sent me an article about why my investment was 
dangerous. I have received 16 percent for years now, and he still receives 6 
percent. 
I would say that one of the hardest things about wealth building is to be 
true to yourself and be willing to not go along with the crowd. For in the 
market, it is usually the crowd that shows up late and is slaughtered. If a 
great deal is on the front page, it's too late in most instances.  Look for a 
new deal. As we used to say as surfers: "There is always another wave." People 
who hurry and catch a wave late usually are the ones who wipe out. 
Smart investors don't time markets. If they miss a wave, they search 
  
for the next one and get themselves in position. Why this is hard for most 
investors is because buying what is not popular is frightening to them. Timid 
investors are like sheep going along with the crowd. Or their greed gets them in 
when wise investors have already taken their profits and moved on. Wise 
investors buy an investment when it's not popular. They know their profits are 
made when they buy, not when they sell. They wait patiently. As I said, they do 
not time the market. Just like a surfer, they get in position for the next big 
swell. 
It's all "insider trading." There are forms of insider trading that are 
illegal, and there are forms of insider trading that are legal. But either way, 
it's insider trading. The only distinction is how far away from the inside are 
you? The reason you want to have rich friends who are close to the inside is 
because that is where the money is made. It's made on information. You want to 
hear about the next boom, get in and get out before the next bust. I'm not 
saying do it illegally, but the sooner you know, the better your chances are for 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
profits with minimal risk. That is what friends are for. And that is financial 
intelligence. 
 
4. MASTER A FORMULA AND THEN LEARN A NEW ONE: The power of learning 
quickly. In order to make bread, every baker follows a recipe, even if it's only 
held in their head. The same is true for making money. That's why money is often 
called "dough." 
Most of us have heard the saying "You are what you eat." I have a 
different slant on the same saying. I say, "You become what you study." In other 
words, be careful what you study and learn, because your mind is so powerful 
that you become what you put in your head. For example, if you study cooking, 
you then tend to cook. You become a cook. If you don't want to be a cook anymore, 
then you need to study something else.  Let's say, a schoolteacher. After 
studying teaching, you often become a teacher. And so on. Choose what you study 
carefully. 
When it comes to money, the masses generally have one basic formula they 
learned in school. And that is, work for money. The formula I see that is 
predominant in the world is that every day millions of people get up and go to 
work, earn money, pay bills, balance checkbooks, buy some mutual funds and go 
back to work. That is the basic formula, or recipe. 
If you're tired of what you're doing, or you're not making enough, it's 
simply a case of changing the formula via which you make money. 
Years ago, when I was 26,1 took a weekend class called "How to Buy Real 
Estate Foreclosures." I learned a formula. The next trick was to have the 
discipline to actually put into action what I had learned. That is where most 
people stop. For three years, while working for Xerox, I spent my spare time 
learning to master the art of buying foreclosures. I've made several million 
dollars using that formula, but today, it's too slow and too many other people 
are doing it. 
So after I mastered that formula, I went in search of other formulas. For 
many of the classes, I did not use the information I learned directly, 'i| but I 
always learned something new. 
I have attended classes designed for only derivative traders, also a class 
for commodity option traders and a class for Chaologists. I was way out of my 
league, being in a room full of people with doctorates in nuclear physics and 
space science. Yet, I learned a lot that made my stock and real estate investing 
more meaningful and lucrative. Most junior colleges and community colleges have 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
classes on financial planning and buying of traditional investments. They are 
great places to start. 
So I always search for a faster formula. That is why, on a fairly regular 
basis, I make more in a day than many people will make in their lifetime. 
Another side note. In today's fast-changing world, it's not so much what 
you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is old.  It is how 
fast you learn. That skill is priceless.  It's priceless in finding faster 
formulas-recipes, if you will, for making dough. Working hard for money is an 
old formula born in the day of cave men. 
 
5. PAY YOURSELF FIRST: The power of self-discipline. If you cannot get 
control of yourself, do not try to get rich. You might first want to join the 
Marine Corps or some religious order so you can get control of yourself. It 
makes no sense to invest, make money and blow it. It is the lack of self-
discipline that causes most lottery winners to go broke soon after winning 
millions.  It is the lack of self-discipline that causes people who get a raise 
to immediately go out and buy a new car or take a cruise. 
It is difficult to say which of the ten steps is the most important.  But 
of all the steps, this step is probably the most difficult to master if it is 
not already a part of your makeup. I would venture to say that it is the lack of 
personal self-discipline that is the No. 1 delineating factor between the rich, 
the poor and the middle class. 
Simply put, people who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for 
financial pressure can never, and I mean never, be rich. As I have said, a 
lesson learned from my rich dad was that "the world will push you around." The 
world pushes people around not because other people are bullies, but because the 
individual lacks internal control and discipline. People who lack internal 
fortitude often become victims of those who have self-discipline. 
In the entrepreneur classes I teach, I constantly remind people to not 
focus on their product, service or widget, but to focus on developing management 
skills. The three most important management skills necessary to start your own 
business are: 
 
1. 
Management of cash flow. 
2. 
Management of people. 
3. Management of personal time. 
 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
I would say, the skills to manage these three apply to anything, not just 
entrepreneurs. The three matter in the way you live your life as an individual, 
or as part of a family, a business, a charitable organization, a city or a 
nation. 
Each of these skills is enhanced by the mastery of self discipline. I do 
not take the saying "pay yourself first" lightly. 
The Richest Man in Babylon, by George Classen, is where the statement "pay 
yourself first" comes from. Millions of copies have been sold.  But while 
millions of people freely repeat that powerful statement, few follow the advice. 
As I said, financial literacy allows one to read numbers, and numbers tell the 
story.  By looking at a person's income statement and balance sheet, I can 
readily see if people who spout the words "pay yourself first" actually practice 
what they preach. 
A picture is worth a thousand words.  So let's again compare the financial 
statements of people who pay themselves first against someone who doesn't.

Study the diagrams and notice if you can pick up some distinctions.  Again, 
it has to do with understanding cash flow, which tells the story. Most people 
look at the numbers and miss the story. If you can truly begin to understand the 
power of cash flow, you will soon realize what is wrong with the picture on the 
next page, or why 90 percent of most people work hard all their lives and need 
government support like Social Security when they are no longer able to work. 
Do you see it? The diagram above reflects the actions of an individual who 
chooses to pay himself first. Each month, they allocate money to their asset 
column before they pay their monthly expenses. Although millions of people have 
read Classen's book and understand the words "pay yourself first," in reality 
they pay themselves last. 
Now I can hear the howls from those of you who sincerely believe in paying 
your bills first. And I can hear all the "responsible" people who pay their 
bills on time. I am not saying be irresponsible and not pay your bills. All I am 
saying is do what the book says, which is "pay yourself first." And the diagram 
above is the correct accounting picture of that action. Not the one that follows. 
My wife and I have had many bookkeepers and accountants and bankers who 
have had a major problem with this way of looking at "pay yourself first." The 
reason is that these financial professionals actually do what the masses do, 
which is pay themselves last. They pay everyone else first. 
There have been months in my life, when for whatever reason, cash flow was 
far less than my bills. I still paid myself first. My accountant and bookkeeper 
screamed in panic.  "They're going to come after you. The IRS is going to put 
you in jail."  "You're going to ruin your credit rating." "They'll cut off the 
electricity." I still paid myself first. 
"Why?" you ask. Because that's what the story The Richest Man In Babylon 
was all about. The power of self-discipline and the power of internal fortitude.  
"Guts," in less elegant terms. As my rich dad taught me the first month I worked 
for him, most people allow the world to push them around. A bill collector calls 
and you "pay or else." So you pay and not pay yourself. A sales clerk says, "Oh, 
just put it on your charge card." Your real estate agent tells you to "go ahead-
the government allows you a tax deduction on your home." That is what the book 
is really about. Having the guts to go against the tide and get rich. You may 
not be weak, but when it comes to money, many people get wimpy. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
I am not saying be irresponsible. The reason I don't have high credit card 
debt, and doodad debt, is because I want to pay myself first. The reason I 
minimize my income is because I don't want to pay it to the government. That is 
why, for those of you who have watched the video The Secrets of the Rich, my 
income comes from my asset column, through a Nevada corporation. If I work for 
money, the government takes it. 
Although I pay my bills last, I am financially astute enough to not get 
into a tough financial situation. I don't like consumer debt. I actually have 
liabilities that are higher than 99 percent of the population, but I don't pay 
for them; other people pay for my liabilities. They're called tenants.  So rule 
No. 1 in paying yourself first is don't get into debt in the first place. 
Although I pay my bills last, I set it up to have only small unimportant bills, 
that I will have to pay. 
Secondly, when I occasionally come up short, I still pay myself first. I 
let the creditors and even the government scream. I like it when they get tough. 
Why? Because those guys do me a favor. They inspire me to i go out and create 
more money. So I pay myself first, invest the money, and let the creditors yell. 
I generally pay them right away anyway. My wife and I have excellent credit. We 
just don't cave into the pressure and spend our savings or liquidate stocks to 
pay for consumer debt. That is not too financially intelligent. 
So the answer is: 
 
1. Don't get into large debt positions that you have to pay for.  Keep 
your expenses low. Build up assets first. Then, buy the big house or nice car. 
Being stuck in the rat race is not intelligent. 
2. When you come up short, let the pressure build and don't dip into your 
savings or investments.  Use the pressure to inspire your financial genius to 
come up with new ways of making more money and then pay your bills. You will 
have increased your ability to make more money as well as your financial 
intelligence. ; : So many times I have gotten into financial hot water, and used 
my brain to create more income, while staunchly defending the assets in my asset 
column. My bookkeeper has screamed and dived for cover, but I was like a good 
trooper defending the fort, Fort Assets. 
Poor people have poor habits. A common bad habit is innocently called 
"Dipping into savings." The rich know that savings are only used to create more 
money, not to pay bills. 
I know that sounds tough, but as I said, if you're not tough inside, the 
world will always push you around anyway. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
If you do not like financial pressure, then find a formula that works for 
you. A good one is to cut expenses, put your money in the bank, pay more than 
your fair share of income tax, buy safe mutual funds and take the vow of the 
average.  But this violates the "pay yourself first" rule. 
The rule does not encourage self-sacrifice or financial abstinence. It 
doesn't mean pay yourself first and starve. Life was meant to be enjoyed. If you 
call on your financial genius, you can have all the goodies of life, get rich 
and pay bills, without sacrificing the good life. And that is financial 
intelligence. 
 
6. PAY YOUR BROKERS WELL: The power of good advice. I often see people 
posting a sign in front of their house that says, "For Sale by Owner." Or I see 
on TV today many people claiming to be "Discount Brokers." 
My rich dad taught me to take the opposite tack. He believed in paying 
professionals well, and I have adopted that policy also. Today, I have expensive 
attorneys, accountants, real estate brokers and stockbrokers. Why? Because if, 
and I do mean if, the people are professionals, their services should make you 
money. And the more money they make, the more money I make. 
We live in the Information Age. Information is priceless. A good broker 
should provide you with information as well as take the time to educate you. I 
have several brokers who are willing to do that for me. Some taught me when I 
had little or no money, and I am still with them today. 
What I pay a broker is tiny in comparison with what kind of money I can 
make because of the information they provide.  I love it when my real estate 
broker or stockbroker makes a lot of money.  Because it usually means I made a 
lot of money. 
A good broker saves me time in addition to making me money-as when I 
bought the piece of vacant land for $9,000 and sold it immediately for over 
$25,000, so I could buy my Porsche quicker. 
A broker is your eyes and ears to the market. They're there every day so I 
do not have to be. I'd rather play golf. 
Also, people who sell their house on their own must not value their time 
much. Why would I want to save a few bucks when I could use that time to make 
more money or spend it with those I love? What I find funny is that so many poor 
and middle class people insist on tipping restaurant help 15 to 20 percent even 
for bad service and complain about paying a broker 3 to 7 percent. They enjoy 
tipping people in the 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
expense column and stiffing people in the asset column. That is not 
financially intelligent. 
All brokers are not created equal. Unfortunately, most brokers are only 
salespeople. I would say the real estate salespeople are the worst. 
They sell, but they themselves own little or no real estate. There is a 
tremendous difference between a broker who sells houses and a broker who sells 
investments. And that is true for stock, bond, mutual fund and insurance brokers 
who call themselves financial planners. As in the fairy tale, you kiss a lot of 
frogs to find one prince. Just remember the old saying, "Never ask an 
encyclopedia salesperson if you need an encyclopedia." 
When I interview any paid professional, I first find out how much property 
or stocks they personally own and what percentage they pay in taxes. And that 
applies to my tax attorney as well as my accountant. I have an accountant who 
minds her own business. Her profession is accounting, but her business is real 
estate. I used to have an accountant that was a small business accountant, but 
he had no real estate. I switched because we did not love the same business. 
Find a broker who has your best interests at heart. Many brokers will .'; 
spend the time educating you, and they could be the best asset you find. Just be 
fair, and most of them will be fair to you. If all you can think about is 
cutting their commissions, then why should they want to be around you? It's just 
simple logic. 
As I said earlier, one of the management skills is the management of 
people. Many people only manage people they feel smarter than and they have 
power over, such as subordinates in a work situation. Many middle managers 
remain middle managers, failing to get promoted because they know how to work 
with people below them, but not with people above them. The real skill is to 
manage and pay well the people who are smarter than you in some technical area. 
That is why companies have a board of directors. You should have one, too. And 
that is financial intelligence. 
 
7. BE AN "INDIAN GIVER": This is the power of getting something for 
nothing. When the first white settlers came to America, they were taken aback by 
a cultural practice some American Indians had. For example, if a settler was 
cold, the Indian would give the person a blanket. Mistaking it for a gift, the 
settler was often offended when the Indian asked for it back. 
The Indians also got upset when they realized the settlers did not want to 
give it back. That is where the term "Indian giver" came from. A simple cultural 
misunderstanding. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
In the world of the "asset column," being an Indian giver is vital to 
wealth. The sophisticated investor's first question is, "How fast do I get my 
money back?" They also want to know what they get for free, also called a piece 
of the action. That is why the ROI, or return of and on investment, is so 
important. 
For example, I found a small condominium, a few blocks from where I live, 
that was in foreclosure. The bank wanted $60,000, and I submitted a bid for 
$50,000, which they took, simply because, along with my bid, was a cashier's 
check for $50,000. They realized I was serious. Most investors would say, aren't 
you tying up a lot of cash? Would it not be better to get a loan on it? The 
answer is, not in this case. My investment company uses this as a vacation 
rental in the winter months, when the "snowbirds" come to Arizona, and rent it 
for $2,500 a month for four months out of the year. For rental during the off-
season, it rents for only $1,000 a month. I had my money back in about three 
years.  Now I own this asset, which pumps money out for me, month in and month 
out. 
The same is done with stocks. Frequently, my broker will call me and 
recommend I move a sizable amount of money into the stock of a company that he 
feels is just about to make a move that will add value to the stock, like 
announcing a new product.  I will move my money in for a week to a month while 
the stock moves up. Then, I pull my initial dollar amount out, and stop worrying 
about the fluctuations of the market, because my initial money is back and ready 
to work on another asset. So my money goes in, and then it comes out, and I own 
an asset that was technically free. 
True, I have lost money on many occasions.  But I only play with money I 
can afford to lose. I would say, on an average ten investments, I hit home runs 
on two or three, while five or six do nothing, and I lose on two or three. But I 
limit my losses to only the money I have in at that time. 
For people who hate risk, they put their money in the bank. And in the 
long run, savings are better than no savings.  But it takes a long time to get 
your money back and, in most instances, you don't get anything for free with it. 
They used to hand out toasters, but they rarely do that these days. 
On every one of my investments, there must be an upside, something for 
free. A condominium, a mini-storage, a piece of free land, a house, stock shares, 
office building. And there must be limited risk, or a low-risk idea. There are 
books devoted entirely to this subject that I will not get into here. Ray Kroc, 
of McDonald's fame, sold hamburger franchises, not because he loved hamburgers, 
but because he wanted the real estate ; under the franchise for free. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
So wise investors must look at more than ROI; it's the assets you get for 
free once you get your money back. That is financial intelligence.      : 
 
8. ASSETS BUY LUXURIES: The power of focus. A friend's child has been 
developing a nasty habit of burning a hole in his pocket. Just 16, he naturally 
wanted his own car. The excuse, "All his friends' parents gave their kids cars." 
The child wanted to go into| 
his savings and use it for a down payment. That was when his father called 
me. "Do you think I should let him do it, or should I just do as other parents 
do and just buy him a car?" 
To which I answered.  "It might relieve the pressure in the short term, 
but what have you taught him in the long term? Can you use this desire to own a 
car and inspire your son to learn something?" Suddenly the lights went on, and 
he hurried home. 
Two months later I ran into my friend again.  "Does your son have his new 
car?" I asked. 
"No, he doesn't. But I went and handed him $3,000 for the car. I told him 
to use my money instead of his college money." "Well, that's generous of you," I 
said. 
"Not really. The money came with a hitch.  I took your advice of using his 
strong desire to buy a car and use that energy so he could learn something." 
"So what was the hitch?" I asked. 
"Well, first we broke out your game again, CASHFLOW. We played it and had 
a long discussion about the wise use of money.  I then gave him a subscription 
to the Wall Street Journal, and a few books on the stock market." 
"Then what?" I asked.  "What was the catch?" 
"I told him the $3,000 was his, but he could not directly buy a car with 
it. He could use it to buy and sell stocks, find his own stockbroker, and once 
he had made $6,000 with the $3,000, the money would be his for the car, and the 
$3,000 would go into his college fund." 
"And what are the results?" I asked. 
"Well, he got lucky early in his trading, but lost all he gained a few 
days later. Then, he really got interested. Today, I would say he is down $2,000, 
but his interest is up. He has read all the books I bought him and he's gone to 
the library to get more. He reads the Wall Street Journal voraciously, watching 
for indicators, and he watches CNBC instead of MTV. He's got only $1,000 left, 
but his interest and learning are sky high. He knows that if he loses that money, 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
he walks for two more years. But he does not seem to care. He even seems 
uninterested in getting a car because he's found a game that is more fun." 
"What happens if he loses all the money?" I asked. 
"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. I'd rather have him lose 
everything now rather than wait till he's our age to risk losing everything. And 
besides, that is the best $3,000 I've ever spent on his education. What he is 
learning will serve him for life, and he seems to have gained a new respect for 
the power of money. I think he's stopped the burning of holes in his pockets." 
As I said in the section "Pay Yourself First," if a person cannot master 
the power of self-discipline, it is best not to try to get rich. For while the 
process of developing cash flow from an asset column in theory is easy, it is 
the mental fortitude of directing money that is hard. Due to external 
temptations, it is much easier in today's consumer world to simply blow it out 
the expense column. Because of weak mental fortitude, that money flows into the 
paths of least resistance. That is the cause of poverty and financial struggle. 
I gave this numerical example of financial intelligence, in this case the 
ability to direct money to make more money. 
If we gave 100 people $10,000 at the start of the year, I gave my opinion 
that at the end of the year: 
 80 would have nothing left. In fact, many would have created I greater 
debt by making a down payment on a new car, refrigerator, TV, VCR or a holiday. 
16 would have increased that $10,000 by 5 percent to 10 percent. 4 would have 
increased it to $20,000 or into the millions. 
We go to school to learn a profession so we can work for money. It is my 
opinion that it is also important to learn how to have money work for you. 
I love my luxuries as much as anyone else. The difference is, some people 
buy their luxuries on credit. It's the keep-up-with-the-Joneses trap. When I 
wanted to buy a Porsche, the easy road would have been to call my banker and get 
a loan. Instead of choosing to focus in the liability column, I chose to focus 
in the asset column. 
As a habit, I used my desire to consume to inspire and motivate my 
financial genius to invest. 
Too often today, we focus to borrowing money to get the things we want 
instead of focusing on creating money.  One is easier in the short term, but 
harder in the long term. It's a bad habit that we as individuals and as a nation 
have gotten into. Remember, the easy road often becomes hard, and the hard road 
often becomes easy. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
The earlier you can train yourself and those you love to be masters of 
money, the better. Money is a powerful force. Unfortunately, people use the 
power of money against them.  If your financial intelligence is low, money will 
run all over you. It will be smarter than you.  If money is smarter than you, 
you will work for it all your life. 
To be the master of money, you need to be smarter than it. Then money will 
do as it is told. It will obey you.  Instead of being a slave to it, you will be 
the master of it. That is financial intelligence. 
 
9. THE NEED FOR HEROES: The power of myth. When I was a kid, I greatly 
admired Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Yogi Berra. They were my heroes. As a kid 
playing Little League, I wanted to be just like them. I treasured their baseball 
cards. I wanted to know everything about them. I knew the stats, the RBI, the 
ERAs, their batting averages, how much they got paid, and how they came up  1 
from the minors. I wanted to know everything because I wanted to be just like 
them. 
Every time, as a 9 or 10 year-old kid, when I stepped up to bat or played 
first base or catcher, I wasn't me. I was Yogi or Hank.  It's one of the most 
powerful ways we learn that we often lose as adults. We lose our heroes. We lose 
our naivete. 
Today, I watch young kids playing basketball near my home.  On the court 
they're not little Johnny; they're Michael Jordan, Sir Charles or Clyde.  
Copying or emulating heroes is true power learning. And that is why when someone 
like O.J. Simpson falls from grace, there is such a huge outcry. 
There is more than just a courtroom trial. It is the loss of a hero. 
Someone people grew up with, looked up to, and wanted to be like. Suddenly we 
need to rid ourselves of that person. 
I have new heroes as I grow older. I have golf heroes such as Peter 
Jacobsen, Fred Couples and Tiger Woods. I copy their swings and do my best to 
read everything I can about them. I also have heroes such as Donald Trump, 
Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, George Soros and Jim Rogers. In my older years, I 
know their stats just like I knew the ERAs and RBI of my baseball heroes.  I 
follow what Warren Buffett invests in, and read anything I can about his point 
of view on the market. I read Peter Lynch's book to understand how he chooses 
stocks. And I read about Donald Trump, trying to find out how he negotiates and 
puts deals together. 
Just as I was not me when I was up to bat, when I'm in the market or I'm 
negotiating a deal, I am subconsciously acting with the bravado of Trump.  Or 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
when analyzing a trend, I look at it as though Peter Lynch were doing it.  By 
having heroes, we tap into a tremendous source of raw genius. 
But heroes do more than simply inspire us. Heroes make things look easy. 
It's the making it look easy that convinces us to want to be just like them. "If 
they can do it, so can I." 
When it comes to investing, too many people make it sound hard. Instead 
find heroes who make it look easy. 
 
10. TEACH AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE: The power of giving.  Both of my dads 
were teachers. My rich dad taught me a lesson I have carried all my life, and 
that was the necessity of being charitable or giving. My educated dad gave a lot 
by the way of time and knowledge, but almost never gave away money.  As I said, 
he usually said that he would give when he had some extra money. Of course, 
there was rarely any extra. 
My rich dad gave money as well as education. He believed firmly in tithing. 
"If you want something, you first need to give," he would always say. When he 
was short of money, he simply gave money to his church or to his favorite 
charity. 
If I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever you 
feel "short" or in "need" of something, give what you want first and it will 
come back in buckets. That is true for money, a smile, love, friendship. I know 
it is often the last thing a person may want to do, but; it has always worked 
for me. I just trust that the principle of reciprocity   it is true, and I give 
what I want. I want money, so I give money, and it comes back in multiples. I 
want sales, so I help someone else sell something, and sales come to me. I want 
contacts and I help someone else get contacts, and like magic, contacts come to 
me. I heard a saying years ago that went, "God does not need to receive, but 
humans need to give." 
My rich dad would often say, "Poor people are more greedy than rich 
people." He would explain that if a person was rich, that person was providing 
something that other people wanted. In my life, over all these   ; years, 
whenever I have felt needy or short of money or short of help, I simply went out 
or found in my heart what I wanted, and decided to give it first. And when I 
gave, it always came back. 
It reminds me of the story of the guy sitting with firewood in his arms on 
a cold freezing night, and he is yelling at the pot-bellied stove,    "When you 
give me some heat, then I'll put some wood in." And when it comes to money, love, 
happiness, sales and contacts, all one needs to remember is first to give what 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
you want and it will come back in droves.   ? Often just the process of thinking 
of what I want, and how could I give what I want to someone else, breaks free a 
torrent of bounty. Whenever I feel that people aren't smiling at me, I simply 
begin smiling and saying hello, and like magic, there are suddenly more smiling 
people around me. It is true that your world is only a mirror of you. 
So that's why I say, "Teach and you shall receive." I have found that the 
more I sincerely teach those who want to learn, the more I learn. If you want to 
learn about money, teach it to someone else. A torrent of new ideas and finer 
distinctions will come in. 
There are times when I have given and nothing has come back or what I have 
received is not what I wanted.  But upon closer inspection and soul searching, I 
was often giving to receive in those instances, instead of giving to give. 
My dad taught teachers, and he became a master teacher.  My rich dad 
always taught young people his way of doing business. In retrospect, it was 
their generosity with what they knew that made them smarter. There are powers in 
this world that are much smarter than we are. You can get there on your own, but 
it's easier with the help of the powers that be. All you need to be is generous 
with what you have, and the powers will be generous with you. 
  
10. CHAPTER TEN 
Still Want More? Here are Some To Do's 
 
Many people may not be satisfied with my ten steps. They see them more as 
philosophies than actions. I think understanding the philosophy is just as 
important as the action. There are many people who want to do, instead of think, 
and then there are people who think but do not do. I would say that I am both. I 
love new ideas and I love action. 
So for those who want "to dos" on how to get started, I will share with 
you some of the things I do, in abbreviated form. 
 
• Stop doing what you're doing. In other words, take a break and assess 
what is working and what is not working. The definition of insanity is doing the 
same thing and expecting a different result. Stop doing what is not working and 
look for something new to do. 
 
• Look for new ideas. For new investing ideas, I go to bookstores and look 
for books on different and unique subjects. I call them formulas. I buy how-to 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
books on a formula I know nothing about. For example, it was in the bookstore 
that I found the book The 16 Percent Solution, by Joel Moskowitz. I bought the 
book and read it. 
  
TAKE ACTION! The next Thursday, I did exactly as the book said. Step by 
step. I have also done that with finding real estate bargains in attorneys' 
offices and in banks. Most people do not take action, or they let someone talk 
them out of whatever new formula they are studying. My neighbor told me why 16 
percent would not work.  I did not listen to him because he's never done it. 
 
• Find someone who has done what you want to do. Take them to lunch. Ask 
them for tips, for little tricks of the trade. As for 16 percent tax lien 
certificates, I went to the county tax office and found the government employee 
who worked in the office. I found out that she, too, invested in the tax liens. 
Immediately, she was invited to lunch. She was thrilled to tell me everything 
she knew and how to do it. After lunch, she spent all afternoon showing me 
everything. By the next day, I found two great properties with her help and have 
been accruing interest at 16 percent ever since. It took a day to read the book, 
a day to take action, an hour for lunch, and a day to acquire two great deals. 
 
• Take classes and buy tapes. I search the newspapers for new and 
interesting classes. Many are for free or a small fee. I also attend and pay for 
expensive seminars on what I want to learn. I am wealthy and free from needing a 
job simply because of the courses I took. I have friends who did not take those 
classes who told me I was wasting my money, and yet they're still at the same 
job. 
 
• Make lots of offers. When I want a piece of real estate, I look at many 
properties and generally write an offer. If you don't know what the "right 
offer" is, neither do I. That is 'the job of the real estate agent. They make 
the offers. I do as little work as possible. 
A friend wanted me to show her how to buy apartment houses.  So one 
Saturday she, her agent and I went and looked at six apartment houses.  Four 
were dogs, but two were good.  I said to write offers on all six, offering half 
of what the owners asked for.  She and the agent nearly had heart attacks. They 
thought it would be rude, that I might offend the sellers, but I really don't 
think the agent wanted to work that hard.  So they did nothing and went on 
looking for a better deal. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
No offers were ever made, and that person is still looking for the "right" 
deal at the right price. Well, you don't know what the right price is until you 
have a second party who wants to deal. Most sellers ask too much.  It is rare 
that a seller will actually ask a price that is less than something is worth. 
Moral of the story: Make offers. People who are not investors have no idea 
what it feels like to be trying to sell something. I have had a piece of real 
estate that I wanted to sell for months. I would have welcomed anything. I would 
not care how low the price. They could have offered me ten pigs and I would have 
been happy. Not at the offer, but just because someone was interested. I would 
have countered, maybe for a pig farm in exchange. But that's how the game works. 
The game of buying and selling is fun. Keep that in mind. It's fun and only a 
game. Make offers. Someone might say "yes." 
And I always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an 
offer with the words "subject to approval of business partner." I never specify 
who the business partner is. Most people do not know my partner is my cat. If 
they accept the offer, and I don't want the deal, I call my home and speak to my 
cat. I make this absurd statement to illustrate how absurdly easy and simple the 
game is. So many people make things too difficult and take them too seriously. 
Finding a good deal, the right business, the right people, the right 
investors, or whatever is just like dating. You must go to the market and talk 
to a lot of people, make a lot of offers, counteroffers, negotiate, reject and 
accept. I know single people who sit at home and wait for the phone to ring, but 
unless you're Cindy Crawford or Tom Cruise, I think you'd best go to the market, 
even if it's only the supermarket. Search, offer, reject, negotiate and accept 
are all parts of the process of almost everything in life. 
 
• Jog, walk or drive a certain area once a month for ten minutes. I have 
found some of my best real estate investments while jogging. I will jog a 
certain neighborhood for a year. What I look for is change. For there to be 
profit in a deal, there must be two elements: a bargain and change. There are 
lots of bargains, but it's change that turns a bargain into a profitable 
opportunity.  So when I jog, I jog a neighborhood I might like to invest in.  It 
is the repetition that causes me to notice slight differences. I notice real 
estate signs that are up for a long time. That means the seller might be more 
agreeable to deal. I watch for moving trucks, going in or out.  I stop and talk 
to the drivers. I talk to the postal carriers. It's amazing how much information 
they acquire about an area. 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
I find a bad area, especially an area that the news has scared everyone 
away from.  I drive it for sometimes a year waiting for signs of something 
changing for the better. I talk to retailers, especially new ones, and find out 
why they're moving in. It takes only a few minutes a month, and I do it while 
doing something else, like exercising, or going 
to and from the store.  
 
• As for stocks, I like Peter Lynch's book Beating the Street for his 
formula for selecting stocks that grow in value. I have found that the 
principles of finding value are the same regardless if it's real estate, stocks, 
mutual funds, new companies, a new pet, a new home, a new spouse, or a bargain 
on laundry detergent. The process is always the same. You need to know what 
you're looking for and then go look for it! 
 
• Why consumers will always be poor. When the supermarket has a sale on, 
say, toilet paper, the consumer runs in and stocks up. When the stock market has 
a sale, most often called a crash or correction, the consumer runs away from it. 
When the supermarket raises its prices, the consumer shops elsewhere. When the 
stock market raises its prices, the consumer starts buying. 
 
• Look in the right places. A neighbor bought a condominium for $100,000. 
I bought the identical condo next door to his for $50,000. He told me he's 
waiting for the price to go up. I told him that his profit is made when you buy, 
not when you sell. He shopped with a real estate broker who owns no property of 
her own. I shopped at the foreclosure department of a bank. I paid $500 for a 
class on how to do this. My neighbor thought that the $500 for a real estate 
investment class was too expensive. He said he could not afford it, and he 
couldn't afford the time.  So he waits for the price to go up. 
  
• I look for people who want to buy first, then I look for someone who 
wants to sell. A friend was looking for a certain piece of land. He had the 
money and did not have the time. I found a large piece of land larger than what 
my friend wanted to buy, tied it up with an option, called my friend and he 
wanted a piece of it. So I sold the piece to him and then bought the land. I 
kept the remaining land as mine for free. Moral of the story: Buy the pie and 
cut it in pieces. Most people look for what they can afford, so they look too 
small. They buy only a piece of the pie, so they end up paying more for less.  

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Small thinkers don't get the big breaks. If you want to get richer, think bigger 
first. 
Retailers love giving volume discounts, simply because most business 
people love big spenders.  So even if you're small, you can always think big. 
When my company was in the market for computers, I called several friends and 
asked them if they were ready to buy also. We then went to different dealers and 
negotiated a great deal because we wanted to buy so many. I have done the same 
with stocks. Small people remain small because they think small; act alone, or 
don't act all. 
 
• Learn from history. All the big companies on the stock exchange started 
out as small companies.  Colonel Sanders did not get rich until after he lost 
everything in his 60s.  Bill Gates was one of the richest men in the world 
before he was 30. 
 
• Action always beats inaction. 
These are just a few of the things I have done and continue to do to 
recognize opportunities. The important words being "done" and "do". As repeated 
many times throughout the book, you must take action before you can receive the 
financial rewards. Act now! 
  
EPILOGUE 
 
How To Pay for a Child's College Education for $7000 
 
As the book draws to a close and approaches publication, I would like to 
share a final thought with you. The main reason I wrote this book was to share 
insights into how increased financial intelligence can be used to solve many of 
life's common problems. Without financial training, we all too often use the 
standard formulas to get through life, such as to work hard, save, borrow and 
pay excessive taxes. Today we need better information. 
I use the following story as a final example of a financial problem that 
confronts many young families today. How do you afford a good education for your 
children and provide for your own retirement? It is an example of using 
financial intelligence instead of hard work to achieve the same goal. 
A friend of mine was griping one day about how hard it was to save money 
for his four children's college education. He was putting $300 away in a mutual 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
fund each month and had so far accumulated about $12,000.  He estimated he 
needed $400,000 to get four children through college. He had 12 years to save 
for it, since his oldest child was then 6 years of age. 
The year was 1991, and the real estate market in Phoenix was terrible. 
People were giving houses away. I suggested to my classmate that he buy a house 
with some of the money in his mutual fund. The idea intrigued him and we began 
to discuss the possibility. His primary concern was that he did not have the 
credit with the bank to buy another house, since he was so over-extended. I 
assured him that there were other ways to finance a property other than through 
the bank. 
We looked for a house for two weeks, a house that would fit all the 
criteria we were looking for. There were a lot to choose from, so the shopping 
was kind of fun. Finally, we found a 3 bedroom 2 bath home in a prime 
neighborhood. The owner had been downsized and needed to sell that day because 
he and his family were moving to California where another job waited. 
He wanted $102,000, but we offered only $79,000. He took it immediately. 
The home had on it what is called a non-qualifying loan, which means even a bum 
without a job could buy it without a banker's approval. The owner owed $72,000 
so all my friend had to come up with was $7,000, the difference in price between 
what was owed and what it sold for. As soon as the owner moved, my friend put 
the house up for rent. After all expenses were paid, including the mortgage, he 
put about $125 in his pocket each month. 
His plan was to keep the house for 12 years and let the mortgage get paid 
down faster, by applying the extra $125 to the principle each month. We figured 
that in 12 years, a large portion of the mortgage would be paid off and he could 
possibly be clearing $800 a month by the time his first child went to college. 
He could also sell the house if it had appreciated in value. 
In 1994, the real estate market suddenly changed in Phoenix and he was 
offered $156,000 for the same house by the tenant who lived in it and loved it. 
Again, he asked me what I thought, and I naturally said sell, on a 1031 tax-
deferred exchange. 
Suddenly, he had nearly $80,000 to operate with. I called another friend 
in Austin, Texas who then moved this tax deferred money into a mini-storage 
facility. Within three months, he began receiving checks for a little less than 
a $1,000 a month in income which he then poured back into the college mutual 
fund that was now building much faster. In 1996, the mini-warehouse sold and he 
received a check for nearly $330,000 as proceeds from the sale which was again 
rolled into a new project that would now throw off over $3,000 a month in income, 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
again, going into the college mutual fund. He is now very confident that his 
goal of $400,000 will be met easily, and it only took $7,000 to start and a 
little financial intelligence. His children will be able to afford the education 
that they want and he will then use the underlying asset, wrapped in his C 
Corporation, to pay for his retirement.   As a result of this successful 
investment strategy he will be able to retire early. 
Thank you for reading this book. I hope it has provided some insights into 
utilizing the power of money to work for you. Today, we need greater financial 
intelligence to simply survive. The idea that it takes money to make money is 
the thinking of financially unsophisticated people. It does not mean that 
they're not intelligent. They have simply not learned the science of making 
money. 
Money is only an idea.  If you want more money simply change your thinking. 
Every self-made person started small with an idea, then turned it into something 
big. The same applies with investing. It takes only a few dollars to start and 
grow it into something big. I meet so many people who spend their lives chasing 
the big deal, or trying to mass a lot of money to get into a big deal, but to me 
that is foolish. Too often I have seen unsophisticated investors put their large 
nest egg into one deal and lose most of it rapidly. They may have been good 
workers but they were not good investors. 
Education and wisdom about money are important.  Start early. Buy a book. 
Go to a seminar. Practice.  Start small.  I turned $5,000 cash into a $1 million 
dollar asset producing $5,000 a month cash flow in less than six years. But I 
started learning as a kid. I encourage you to learn because it's not that hard. 
In fact, it's kind of easy once you get the hang of it. 
I think I have made my message clear. It's what is in your head that 
determines what is in your hands. Money is only an idea. There is a great book 
called Think and Grow Rich. The title is not Work Hard and Grow Rich. Learn to 
have money work hard for you and your life will be easier and happier. Today, 
don't play it safe, play it smart. 
  
Take Action! 
 
Many of you were given two great gifts: your mind and your time. It is up 
to you to do what you please with both. With each dollar bill that enters your 
hand, you and only you have the power to determine your destiny. Spend it 
foolishly, you choose to be poor.  Spend it on liabilities, you join the middle 
class. Invest it in your mind and learn how to acquire assets and you will be 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
choosing wealth as your goal and your future. The choice is yours and only yours.  
Every day with every dollar, you decide to be rich, poor or middle class. 
Choose to share this knowledge with your children, and you choose to 
prepare them for the world that awaits. No one else will. 
You and your children's future will be determined by choices you make 
today, not tomorrow. 
We wish you great wealth and much happiness with this fabulous gift called 
life.

About the Authors-Robert T. Kiyosaki 
 
"The main reason people struggle financially is because they spent years 
in school but learned nothing about money. The result is, people learn to work 
for money... but never learn to have money work for them." says Robert. 
Born and raised in Hawaii, Robert is fourth-generation Japanese American. 
He comes from a prominent family of educators. His father was the head of 
education for the State of Hawaii. "After high school, Robert was educated in 
New York and upon graduation, he joined the U. S. Marine Corps and went to 
Vietnam as an officer and a helicopter gunship pilot. 
Returning from the war, Robert's business career began. In 1977 he founded 
a company that brought to the market the first nylon and Velcro "surfer" wallets, 
which grew into a multi-million dollar worldwide product. He and his products 
were featured in Runner's World, Gentleman's Quarterly, Success Magazine, 
Newsweek, and even Playboy. 
Leaving the business world, he co-founded in 1985, an international 
education company that operated in seven countries, teaching business and 
investing to tens of thousands of graduates. 
Retiring at age 47, Robert does what he enjoys most... investing. 
Concerned about the growing gap between the haves and have nots, Robert created 
the board game CASHFLOW, which teaches the game of money, here before only known 
by the rich. 
Although Robert's business is real estate and developing small cap 
companies, his true love and passion is teaching. He has shared the speaking 
stage with such greats as Og Mandino, Zig Ziglar, and Anthony Robbins. Robert 

 
who controls the past controls the future, who controls the present controls the past. 
Kiyosaki's message is clear.  "Take responsibility for your finances or take 
orders all your life. You're either a master of money or a slave to it." Robert 
holds classes that last from 1 hour to 3 days teaching people about the secrets 
of the rich. Although his subjects run from investing for high returns and low 
risk; to teaching your children to be rich; to starting companies and selling 
them; he has one solid earth shaking message. And that message is, Awaken The 
Financial Genius that lies within you. Your genius is waiting to come out. 
This is what world famous speaker and author Anthony Robbins says about 
Robert's work. 
  
"Robert Kiyosaki's work in education is powerful, profound, and life 
changing. I salute his efforts and recommend him highly." 
During this time of great economic change, Robert's message is priceless.
