PREFACE.
I
CALL this
little book " The Essentials of Perspective," because
it seems to me
that
it contains
as much
information about the science of which it treats
as the artist or the draughtsman ever has occasion to
make use
of, except under the most unusual conditions.
I do not claim
to have discovered any new thing, either in
the principles or possible applications of per-
spective
science.
But
it has occurred
to me, as I know
it has occurred
to many
others with a similar
ex-
perience in teaching drawing, that a book on
perspective, which should be exhaustive enough
to redeem the
study from the contempt with which it is too often treated by artists—an estimate which is, to a considerable
extent, justified by such presentations of it as ai-e usually found in the " hand-" and " text-books " in common
use—and yet fi'ee, as far as possible, from the technical
difficulties which the
unscientific mind is pretty sure
to encounter in the profounder treatises, might be of use.
If, on glaucing through the book, some things are found to have been
left out which
are usually intro-
duced into a work of
this kind, I ask the reader
to look twice before he finds fault with the omission, as
this weeding out of what have seemed, to me, unessential
things has been the means on which I have mainly
relied in the efEoit to make clear the really important truths.
I have aimed, too, to make the illustrations such
as
should seem to connect the study with the work of the
artist rather than
to use them
as diagrams by
which to demonstrate abstractions,, and such also as might, for the most part, be understood without the help
of letters of reference.
It may be of interest to teachers of drawing to know that these illustrations
are
of precisely the aame
character as those which I have used for many years in teaching perspective from the black-board
; and while

pupils do not always make as good transcripts of them in their note-books as one would like to see, they make
them quite good enough to fix in the mind the lesson which each
is intended to convey, and
find them
infi-
nitely more interesting and
jjractical than the pure theory
to which they are
so often
treated
in counettion
with this branch of study.
The reader ^vho cares
to go farther in the scientific study of
perspective than I have attempted
to lead
him will
find
" Modern Persi^ective," by Professor W. E. Ware, of Columbia College, the best book
for
his
purpose.
Mr. Ware was my teacher, and I have to thank him for the most that I know about the subject ;
and I am
sure his work remains the most masterly and thorough presentation of it which has yet been made.

CHAPTER
I.
FIRST PRINCIPLES.
E
VEE.YBODY knows well enough
that
^vhen
you
look
along
a straight
street
or
railway, or on a
garden
or
field
planted
in
regular
ron's, the
lines which
you
see
before
you, and which
you
know
to be
parallel, seem
to
slope,
or
incline toward
each other
as
if they would meet
in
a point
if they were long enough.
In
otlier
-words, all parallel lines seem to converge
as they
recede from the
observer.
And everybody
also
knows,
or
ought
to know, and must know
be-
fore
this
inquiry can be carried any farther, that
any
set
of parallel
lines which may be
in

to converge to-

to be that of the actual lines.
In the little sketch
(Fig.
1)
it
will be noticed that the
lines of most importance
all run
in one
direction,
as
if they Avould
meet and disappear
in one point, and drawings of
this kind are sometimes said to be in one-point perspec-

tive.
Sometimes
it
is called
Parallel
Perspective, perhaps
because
the
lines
of most importance
are
all
parallel, perhaps because one end
or
side
of each
object represented
(in
this
case the end of each house)
is
pai'allel with
the
flat
sheet
of
glass,
or
paper,
or what
not, on which
the
picture
is
supposed
to be
drawn.
Please note the sketch
a moment and
try
to
realize the exact
conditions under which
it
is sup-
posed
to
have been
made.
Anyone who
lives
in a
city can
reproduce
these
conditions any day.
Get
possession
of one
of
the forward
seats
in
a horse
car with the window closed and you have
everythino-
you want.
Tlie window in
the end
of
the
car
is
to be regarded
as
the
surface through which you get
the view and on which you might make a picture of
it.
This picture
(Fig.
1)
looks
just
as
if
it
had
been
drawn
on
such
a
vertical
plane
(or pane)
of
glass
as
the window
of the
car, which pane
of
glass would have been
parallel with the nearest end
of
every house which
appears
in
the
picture, would
it not ?
Notice,
too, that with a few unimportant
ex-
ceptions such
as the
line of shadow
across the
street, the
edges
of the
lantern
on
the
street
lamp, and
the
lines
of
the
gables
of
the dormer windows—of
the
church
too,
if you
can make them
out—notice
that
^vith
these few exceptions
every
outline
in the picture
is either
exactly
parallel with
that edge of
the
bljject
for which
it stands
or
it
is drawn toward a point which
is
directly in front of the
observer's
eye when he
looks
straight along
the
street.
You
^vill
notice,
too, that
this point
is
a
little
to
the
left
of the middle
of the
street and somewhat
higher
than
the
heads
of
the
horses
on
the
coal-cart, from
•which
I hope you
will be able to
infer that the
observer, in order
to have obtained such a view as this,
must have been standing
a
little
to the left of the middle
of the
street, and on something
high enough
to enalde him
to look
over
the heads
of
the horses
;
and
if you
understand
this you
will
also under-
stand
that
the whole character
of the picture would be changed
if the observer
w^ere
to move
his head,
showing
that
the
apparent
direction
of
the
sloping
lines
does
not
depend
at
all
upon
the
position
of
the
buildings
to which
they belong, but
simply upon
the
position of
the
observer's
eye.
If
this
is
moved, the
jjoiut toward which the
lines
incline (and which we may
as well
begin
to
call
the
vanishing-
point,
for
tliat
is
its name) seems
to move too;
if he were
to approach either curbstone, this point would

approach
the
sam(^ curbstone
;
if he were
to
raise or depress
his head, the
vanishing-point would be
cor-
respondingly
raised
or
depressed.
This may be
demonstrated
in
a
very
striking way
by
noting
the
changes which take
place
in
the view one
gets

lines of the
fences, or roads, or rows of planted
corn which run
straight away from
the track
along which you are moving seem to turn on a
pivot as you pass them, and
to
point
continu-
ally toward a point on the horizon, which seems
to move along with
you.
Now, what
is
true
in
this
simple
street
view
is
true
of
any
other.
I
have
dwelt
a
little on
this one because
it
is very simple, and
the
lessons
it has
to
teach
are
easily
learned.
But simple
or
not,
it contains about everything
that is necessary to
illustrate
every principle of
the
science
by.
We
shall
see how
variously
these
principles
are
applied
more
readily
l)y
means of other illustrations
; but the principles
themselves could
really all be demonstrated by means of
this
one, and
nearly
all the most important
])ic-
torial work
that
is ever done
is
in
this same simple elementary
" parallel "
perspective.
You
can,
for
that
matter, draw
anything according to the
principles of parallel perspective
;
things
seen
cornerwise, as
this
sheepfold (Fig. 2)
is, or presenting apy number of oblique
lines, like
the corner of
the cottage roof (Fig. 3), just as Avell
as those seen endwise, as is the case Avith the street
in
Fig.
1.
But
the way to do
this
is something which
I will
try to show a little
further on. and
it may be well
for
the

present to say that the term
is usually a]j])lied only to such views of objects as Figs.
1 aud 4
illustrate, and
that objects which, like the sheepfold,
jiresent angles but involve
the use
of horizontal
lines only, are said
^V'
to be
in
" angular "
or
" two-point "
perspective
; while views which, like
>f4i'f^l
^^S-
^' consist mostly of oblique lines, and so would involve, if all the lines
^\:?'P^?^\^''ljs^^^^0^l'r.-'-^
were di-awn to their vanishing-points, the use
of
at least three of these, are
^^^';^ said
to ])e
in
"ol)lique,"
or three-point
perspective.
These
terms
really
mean next
to
nothing, as there may l)e oblique lines in the simplest views,
such as those of the dormer windows in Fig.
1, ^vhose
vanishing-points
are
always
to be found
if anyone wants them, and
as even
in such cases
as
that shown in Fig.
3, there are always Avays enough of doing without these
points in practice.
But the terms are in common enough use, so that I was
afraid the reader might think I had omitted
to mention some very impor-
tant matter if I left them out— a
consideiation, by
the way, which
has
in-
duced me
to
insert a good many other things Avliicli, as far as understanding the
jDrincijjles of perspective is

concerned, might as well have been ignored altogether.
Figs. 4, 5, and G illustrate all three of these phases of
the subject as applied to one simple object.
You see there are tliree vanishing-points to the lid alone in Fig.
G.

FIRST PRINCIPLES.
What is
true, then, of the view obtained through the
foj-ward window of
the horse-car
is true of that
which any window commands, namely, that all lines traced on the glass in such a way as to form true pictures
of the objects seen through it will be found
to be
either parallel with the edges of the objects themselves,
or converging toward
points which
are
directly in
front
of the
observei"'s eye when
he
looks
in
the
direction
in
which
the
edges
of
the
objects
are
known to run.
Anybody can understand
this
at a glauce
in
cases where the only lines which have a vanishing-
point
run
straight away from the
observer, as
in
Figs.
1 and 4
; but
it
is not quite so obvious when
the
lines to be studied run in other directions, and ^^^
the vanishing-points
to
l>e
located are more numer-
'
ous.
A little experimenting will, however, convince
the student that the law just stated
is
as
true
in
the one case as in the other.
If he will
seat himself before a window which
^'s- '^
commands a view containing a building or two, not too far away, and which
is
fitted with a screen of
wire
gauze to keep out the flies, he will have the best possible apparatus for conducting these experiments
; for he
can not only draw on the gauze, with
a
bit of chalk
or charcoal, lines which cover, and
so give the exact
appai-ent directions of, the edges of the objects he is studying, but, by tying bits of thread to the points on
the screen where he
locates
his vanishing-points, and bringing the other end of each thread to his eye, he
will be able to demonstrate, beyond a perad venture, the truth of
the
rule just
stated, that all ike lines in a
picture either Tiave just the same direction as
the corresponding lines in
tlie object itself, or are drawn toroard
vanishing-points tvhich are to hefound
Inj loohing in the direction which the lines of the object are hnoivn to

follow—for the direction of any one of these threads Avill be found
to be
exactly the same as that of the
cori-esponding
line
or edge
of
the object
re]iresented.

and
tliose which immediately folloAv it will
illustrate the points which I wish you to establish for yourselves at the window screen.
You will soon find when you begin to draw on
the screen, that you can only represent what
is seen by
one eye, and that you have to keep your head pretty still, in order to accomplish anything even then.
It is a
great deal better, however, for 5^ou
to
find
these things
out for yourself
;
so, if you
please, they will not be
in-
sisted upon here.
A bit of card-board, or very thin metal, with a little
hole pricked in it to look through, fixed firmly in an up-
right position, about two feet in front of the screen, will
l)e of
assistance in keeping the " station-point " (for that
is what the position of the
observer's eye
is
called) sta-
tionary.
The limits
of your picture
are as far to
the
right
and
left,
or up and down,
as
you can manage
to
see
through
this
little
hole.
You may turn your head as
much
as you have a mind
to, and everything you may
have seen in books on perspective about the necessity of
keeping the eye
fixed, and about perspective not being true except within
a
certain distance from the cen-
tre of your field of vision
is all humbug.
Such statements have bothered
students of
perspective more than
a little before now.
Don't let them bother you.
The " field of vision "
is a term applied to the whole
space which
your
view from the
station-point in-
cludes.
The
point
directly
in
front
of youv
eye, Avhen you look squarely at the
screen,
is
manifestly the
centi'e
of
tliis
field, and
is usually called the
" centre of
vision."
Writers" on perspective have sometimes

called the things which have just been defined by different names, but
these which
I have given
are
the most common, and
are,
I
think,
expressive enough to be easily remembered.
Now, if
one were standing
directly behind
the observer whose
position
is indicated in
Fig.
7, he would see that, with relation to the
vanishing-point found
in carrying out the lines
of the picture of the
church, the observer's eye, or " station-point," would be as it is shown
in Fig.
8.
The relation "of the station-point to the screen, and of the object
represented to both of these, is stated diagrammatically in Fig.
9.
Fio-.
10 shows how the case would have stood
if
these relations
w^ere altered
so
as
to make the
screen stand obliquely as compared
with the sides of the church, instead of parallel with the front of it as
9.
The dotted
lines give
in both cases some idea of the size of the
drawino- on the
screen, which
in
the
last instance would be some-
thing like Fig. 11.
Remember that all the diagrams
ai'e good
for
is
to
call your attention
to
the fact that
the line from the station-point to the vanishing-
point will, in eveiy case, be exactly parallel
to
the lines of the
object with which
this point is
associated.

are conducted gives you a glimpse of the sea, or

ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIl^E
of a
flat, open
country, where
there
are no
hills
or
near woods
in
sight
to obstruct the
line
of the
horizon, you will
find that
all the
horizontal or level
lines which are anywhere in sight have
their van-
ishing-points somewhere in
this
horizon.
Do
not
confine your observations
to
the
level
lines however;
it
is
especially
desirable
that
you
should
pay
a
good
deal
of
attention to the oblique
lines which
are
to be found
in
roofs,
lat-
tices, the braces of open timber-work, etc., and it will, perhaps, be just
as well, after
all, if your window does not command
a view
of the
horizon
; for you might think too much about
it
if you had
it, and
so might fail to observe other things which are of quite as much im-
portance.
Only it would be well
to verify for yourself
at some window
which did command an unobstructed view of
the
sea
or
])lain,
the
statement just made, that the vanishing-points of all level lines are to
,Jc<y be found in the horizon.
After that you
can, in studying any view whatever, locate the
horizon
with
])erfect
confidence by simply carrying out
until they
meet any two lines drawn upon your screen to represent parallel hori-
zontal lines.
Their vanishing-point will,
of course, indicate the place
where the horizon
is.
You can draw fairly well on
the window-pane with a brush of
color, and fix the threads to the glass with wafers
; but the wire screen
will
be found
to be much
the most convenient
if any considerable
number of lines are to be drawn and tested.

F/KST PRINCIPLES.
9
If you will
convince
yoni\self hy a
little of
this kind
of experimenting of the truth
of the following
statements, nothing that this book contains ought to give you much trouble afterward.
Perspective
science
is simply the
application
to
the
optical laws which
these experiments
will
deter-
mine, of a little very elementary geometry
;
certainly not more than any school-boy ought
to know by the
time he is fifteen years old.""^
Establish, then, to your own satisfaction, these truths by actual observation
:
Fii-st. All
lines or edges
in
nature which
are
parallel
with yonr
j^icture-plane
are
accurately
repre-
sented by lines having
the same
directions
as
themselves, and
as any number of such
lines or edges that
happen to be parallel to each other are still parallel in the
picture-plane, they have no
vanishing-point at all.
Thus the jjicture of a vertical line will always be vertical, and
the. slope of any gable, which squarely
faces
yoiu' picture-plane, or your jncturc-plane
indefirdtely extended, will be just the same in the picture as it is in
reality.
Second. When there are two or more such lines or edges as these which are equal in length, the pictures
of them will be equal to each other
too, and any regular figure which they may form in reality will appear
just as regular in the
picture.
Tiie cart-wheel
in
Fig.
1, for example,
is, or ought
to
be,
perfectly round,
and the fi-ont of the box in Fig.
4, is a perfect rectangle.
Thiixl.
All lines or edges in nature which are not parallel
to your picture-plane are represented by lines
which have a different direction from that of the lines or edges themselves, and which incline toward a point
which may always be found on the j)icture-plane if this is sufiiciently extended.
Fourth.
This point is the picture of the place where the
line itself would
disappear
if extended
indefi-
nitely.
* It may be well enougli to say in
this place, that although the picture may be, and occasionally is, supposed to be made on an inclined
surface, a series of vertical flat surfaces joined together at an angle, or eveu ou one
that
is curved, such cases are altogether exceptional and
will be considered by themselves by and
by, and the main principles of the science are usually
to be understood with reference to just
such a ])icture-plane as your upright window screen represents, and just such a statiou-point as the perforated card-board stands for.
/

10
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIl^E.
Fifth.
This point may be established by means of a
line from the station-point
to
the
picture-plane
drawn parallel to the lines in the object which vanish at this point.
Sixth. This point being common to all lines running in that direction may also be found by drawing the
pictures of any two of them and extending them imtil they meet.
Seventh. The vanishing-points of all horizontal lines will be found in the hoi'izon.
Eighth. The horizon will be represented by a level
line
across the
pictui-e, which
line will be just as
high
as the observer's eye.
Note this carefully, and make sure of the
fact
that, however high up you may
happen to be, you do not have to look down to see the horizon.
But this matter of the horizon is one of sufficient importance to be given in a chapter by itself.

CHAPTER
II.
THE HOBIZON.
OUR
-observations
at the
screen
have shown
us, among other
things,
that the
horizon, whether
it
is
actually in
sight or whether
its position
is determined
l)y finding
the vanishing-point of any set
of
horizontal
lines,
is
always
apparently just on a,^^
level with
the
observer's
eye,, however high
or however
low that may happen to be
;
but observe other
illustra-
tions of the same phenomenon.
Look
at
the lines of
the bridge in Fig.
12, for exam-
})le.
All the
hoi-izontal
lines Vjelow the eye that
are not
actually parallel with
the horizon seem, you see, to slope
ui>\vard toward
it, while all those above tlie eye seem just
as obviously to
sl(j]ie downward toward
it, showing that
the only jjlace where the lines do not slope one Avay or the
other must be just at the
level of the eye.
Fio-. 13
is
introduced
merely
to show
that
all
the
lines to be studied may be above the eye.
We become so
accustomed io tliinking of the
horizon as the edge of the
eartli which
is ])eneath our
feet, that
it
is sometimes nee-
^'s- "•
essary to be i-eminded of the fact that it is the vanishing-line of everythituj that
is level
;
whether it is under
our feet or over oiu' heads.

ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTiyE.
The cloud surfaces are often just as level
as a plain and jjresent the same
perspective effects.
Shelley's
" Glides glimmering o'er
My fleece-like _;?o(w
By the midnight breezes strewn "
show that
he had
observed
this more
accurately than
a good many land-
scape
painters have
clone.
No\v, when you
think of
it, any lev-
el
line of whose ex-
istence it
is possible
to conceive may
l)e
thought of as drawn
on
a
plane
surface
or floor, may it not ?
and
if you imagine
^^ any
horizontal
line
,
wliich
j'ou have oc-
casion to draw as ly-
ing in such a plane,
or on
such
a noor
^''^-
'3-
(which
means
the
same thing), you can
easily see
that
the only place where
the
line and
its
vanishing-point and the floor itself would all be
lost in one straight
line would be that in which the floor on
which the Hue was drawn ha.])[H'iied

is

p.-s
vatory (Fig. 14).
And so you can always
locate the horizon accurately if you can manage to get a glimpse
auywbei-e of a
flat surface which
is
seen edgewise.
Whei-ever in your picture or in
the view which forms
the subject
of
it, a
level
surface
is seen edgewise,
it
will appear
as a
straight
line which exactly coincides
with the horizon.
Now, if
this simple and very obvious fact were always borne
in mind it would
enal)le artists
to avoid
some veiy awkward
mistakes.
Fig. 15 shows one

It occurred in a picture shown at one

is conveniently seen edgewise, and
the
fact
noted above is apparent enougli.
The line in which the van-
ishing-points
are situated
is vertical
in
this
case, of course,
because
a
vertical
plane
seen edgewise cannot appear
like
anything except a vertical line.
It
is equally cleai-, I
liope,
that
however many
different
directions
the
lines
of
the

have had, the
vanishing-points of all
of them must have l)een in this vei'ti-
cal line.

with
this
di-awing,
or by means
of
the
screen with any view that will give you the same kind of lines, and see if you can make the vanishing-points

Now, to show how easy
it

so
obvious
a
fact
as
this, I give, in

What
the

knew about
perspective was that
pictures of paral-

a common vanishing-point, but what
he

that
the

If he had

must have known
that

The roof of the i:)orch is seen edgewise and its edge coincides Avith the line in which the vanishing-points
of all the lines in the other I'oofs, which are parallel with this one, are situated.
I wish you would take a I'uler and test this drawing and
see that what has just been stated is true, and
that it makes no diifei-ence at all whether some of the lines 4n the roofs are horizontal or not.
No matter what
their direction may be, they lie
in oblique
planes, and
that
is enough.
You will
find
their vanishing-points in the oblique line of which the edge of the roof of the porch forms a part.
If you care to think of these horizontal lines as lying in horizontal planes too, you are quite at liberty to
do so, and you will
find
their vanishing-points in the level
horizon j list loliere the oJ>lique line crosses
if.
There niifjht be roofs havinsj half a dozen different in-
, clinations
in
tlie
picture, but
as long
as
their horizontal
edges were
all
parallel, the oblique lines which indicated
-i
the actual slope of the
different roofs would all cross each
other at the same point in the horizon.
Fig. 20 illustrates
this.
The
Iniildings
in
this sketch
(Fig.
20)
all stand
either parallel Avith, or
at
right
angles
to, each
other, so
that
all the horizontal
lines in tlie picture vanish either at
the
])oint in
the horizon where the
otlier lines cross
it, or
at one other which is outside the picture, to the right.
All the roofs have the same slant as those of the house in the immediate foreground
;
that
is, they are
all just as steep as one or the other of these, but as some of the buildings stand at right angles to this one, of
course the lines of some of the roofs have other vanishing-points than those employed in drawing the nearest
ones.
In studying the sketch, do not mind any of the roofs except those which are parallel to those of the
nearest house.
These are
the left-hand
i-oof
of the
tower, which
is ]iarallel
to
the left-hand
roof in the foreground, as

The

is shown
in
Fig.

The npjjer horizon in this
figure is
numbered "third"
to corresjioud with Fig. 23
for the sake of
the comparison
just
suggested;
but
in this
view of a street in Ville
Fi-anche (Fig. 26, or rather
in
the
little diagram, Fig. 25, which explains the con-
struction of
it), the two " horizons "
ai-e numbered
in
the natural
order.
It would only have confused
this
diagram to draw the vertical " horizon," but you will see that
the two principal vanishing-points would be in
such a line if it were to be drawn.
Notice that all the level lines in the jjicture run to vanishing-points in the original or first horizon, while
the lines of the
street, being inclined, vanish higher up.
Toward
the top of the picture the street turns to
the
left, but you can see by the diagram that the slope remains the same, because its vanishing-point
is still
in the same " horizon."
It only remains
to
be
said that the
little
street crossing the
pictui-e
horizontally
near the bottom
is level, and the slight bend in the gutter
in the middle of the street, which shows plainly
enough in Fig. 26, has been left out of the diagram for the sake of simjjlifying
it.

CHAPTER
III.
ONE CLASS OF MEASUKEMENTS.—THOSE OBTAINED BY IMEANS OF PARALLELS.
THE
principles of perspective have
thus far been considered with
reference only to the
direction of the
lines of the picture.
It remains to consider them as applied
to
fixing the sizes of
the
objects
repre-
sented.
In the
first
place, let it be clearly understood that the only measurements which are of any
consequence
to
the draughtsman
are
relative measurements.
As far
as the
artist
is concerned, he never
thinks of any others
; but architects and others who work from plans and elevations which are drawn to scale
do indeed use the actual measures, because
in their case that
is the most convenient way, but even then the
actual measures become relative as fast
as they ai-e applied
to the drawing, and these
last
are the only ones
which appear in the result.
For the term " drawing to scale," an expression constantly used
in connection with
the construction of
geometi'ical plans and diagrams, has absolutely no significance when
applied
to a drawing in
perspective.
You may draw two or three lines
in
it by scale if you wish, but
all
the others will have to be measured by
means of these; and even the first two or three may be put in just exactly as well without reference to any
scale at all, and, indeed, much better, as far as producing a good effect is concerned.
No one can tell in looking at a perspective drawing whether a
l)uilding is twenty feet high or
fifty feet,
except by comparing
it with some other object for which we carry a fairly accurate standard
in our minds.
Steps, for example, are of about the same height for all kinds of buildings, and furnish a pretty good stand-
ard by which to measure other things
; and lamp-posts, gate-ways for foot-paths,
etc., serve a similar purpose.
The commonest and surest standard of heights
is, however, the human figure.
The horse answers pretty well,
but you are not so sure of him.
A pony may easily be mistaken
for a
horse, but a child will never be mis-

--^a-^^ife
taken for a man if
lie
has been drawn in any respectable fashion
; and so the magnitudes of a picture become
intelligible the moment the human
ficrure
is introduced.
Then, a word I'egarding the amount
of measuring wliirli
it is necessaiy to do will be
in order.
Students
sometimes give themselves a great deal of unnecessary troiible al)out
tliis.
You can, of
course, space ofE with mathematical precision the Avidth

want
to draw—you may even determine exactly
toward which
point of
the
comi)ass
the weather-
cock
is
pointing, and
the
length of the sparrow's
tail on
the
point
of
the
galjle
;
but
if you
are
really trying
to draw the
liuilding you
will not
trouble yourself
aljout these
things, or
rather,
if
you
can draw
it
at
all, you
will
settle
all
such
details accurately enough without resorting to me-
chanical methods.
Not only is
it unnecessary
in
practice to determine with precision
the measure-
ments
of
insignificaiit
details,
but
the
habit
of
doing so has often had
the effect of
diverting the
mind from the more important phases of
the sci-
ence, and even of discrediting
it altogether.
It
is
hard
to account for
the
size of
the bugbear which this
study has grown
to be, among students of
art, on any other ground than that of the gradual obscuring of
the main questions which it presents by the host of unimportant, although often amusing, ones which suggest
themselves
to the student.
One who has mastered
the
principles
of the
science thoroughly often
finds the
solution of such problems extremely diverting
; but they are very perplexing to the beginner, and should not
be allowed
to embarrass him in his efforts to grasp the central, and only essential, truths.

MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED BY PARALLELS.

Two kinds of measurements are employed in making j^ictm-es.
The first enables us to determine the' ap-
parent
size of an object with
reference to some very obvious dimension—its height, for instance
; the other
relates
to the foreshortening of
objects, and
to
fixing distances between them, along lines which run to a
vauisliing-point.
The two processes are quite distinct, although they may not seem to be so at
fii-st.
.
Look at Fig.
27, for
instance.
It is quite a
different, and a verj- much
easier, matter
to determine how high one driver's
head ought
to
be, as compared
with
the other's,
than it Avould be to measure the distance between
the
two.
Now, the
length
of
the
house
might
be
eompai'ed
Avith
that
of
another
one
wliich
was known
to stand parallel
with
it —supposing
such
a
one
to
have
appeai'ed
in
tlie
pictui-e
l>y
just
such
a process
as that employed to
de-
termine the
relative heights of the two meu
;
but
the
widtli
of
the
end
of the
house—which,
as
you
see,
faces
tlie
road—would have
to
be
de-
tei-mined
by
the
same
method
as
that
wliich
would be employed to measure
the distance
])e-
tween the carts.
The
same
is
manifestly
true
of the spacing
of the posts
in, the
fence,
or
of the
widths
of the windows,
and,
generallJ^
of
all
distances which
one
has occasion
to measure along
lines which are
said
to run "into the
picture," because
tliey go
to a van-
ishing-point.
The same tiling is .shown in
Fig. 2S, where
it is perhaps a
little
clearer
still, as only straight lines have

been employed in the lines running "into the picture;" and
as the widths of the walls and
the pathway
are
indicated by
lines
parallel with
the
picture-plane, the measurements are applied
to them as well asto
the height of the two figures, and in exactly the same way.
The
construction
in these two illustrations
is precisely the same as that in Fig. 25, except that in these
the slope is downward instead of upward.
In all such cases as those just given, the only mathematical
prin-
ciple involved
in making the
measui-eraents
is
the very simple proposition—as nearly self-evident, perhaps,
as anything can be
thaiparallels between 'parallels are equal.
In both tliese examples the lines representing
the height of the objects are known to
be
parallel to each
otlier, because
they are both vertical, and
the
line through
the top of
botli
is known to
Ije ]iarallel
to
that through
tlie
l)ottom,
because
it
lias
the same
vanish-
ing-point
; and
as
parallels between
parallels must be equal, the height of
tlie object which
is farthest off must be accurately indicated
l)y the verti-
cal line which
is nearest to us, and that is all there is to be said about it.
The line on the ground
is tlie first one to be drawn, because that will
give the vanishing-point whenever it cuts the horizon of the plane in which
it lies.
This point happens, in
Fig.
28, to be the same point as that used
in drawing the inclined walk, but that is only because the line through the
feet of the two figures
is
parallel
to those
of the walls
at
the sides.
In
the same way, the
lines running
downhill from one cart to the other, in
Fig. 27, are parallel
to
those of the fence.
These two figures
illus-
trate the
principle only as applied to the measurement of lines which are parallel to
tlie picture-jdane
; but
as far as measui-ing one line by another which
is
parallel
to
it
is
concerned, the
rule applies to any others
just as well.
You are just as sure, for example, that the
railroad-ties in Fig. 29—that part of them, at least,
which
lies between the
rails—are
all of
the same
length, as you
are
that
the
fence-jiosts
are
all
of the
same
height.
Observe that
this does
not
contradict what was said on
the preceding page about
the
impossibility

MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED BY PARALLELS.
•Zi)

of measuring distances by
this method along
lines which run
to a vanishing-point.
Strictly speaking, we
do not measure the ties in Fig. 29 at all—we only know that whatever the length of one
of them
is, that of
all
the
others
is the same.
Figs.
30,
31, and
32
illustrate
in
a
general and
abstract way the truth of the proposition
just
stated.
As long as the dotted lines in either figure are parallel, the lines be-
tween them, being also parallel to each other, must be equal to eacli
other in length, Avhatever the direction of any of the lines may be.

short
lines
in

railroad-ties

in

these spaces are irregular.

All this seems very obvious
and
simple,

Ijut
it
is

often

artists,
and

most
of

measurement indicated here is taken very carefully fi-om the original work.
I wish the student would study this little picture long enough

it

The error

it, and that there can be no possible excuse
for him
if
it ever occurs
in
his o\\n work.
Please notice that, as the whole foreground is obviously intended to be level, a line from the feet of the figure
through any one of those belonging to the cows must be a horizontal line; and being horizontal, it would have
its vanishing-point in the horizon—-which, happily for us, is in plain sight.
It is only necessary, then, to draw
F'S- 34-
such a line, and to continue it until
it cuts the horizon to find the vanishing-point, and then
to remember that
any line that vanishes at the same point must be parallel to tins one.

is a veiy easy matter to find out just how much
these

amount to, and so to locate the

to compare
his height with that of the

It has been treated

it is only because

look as if the master had been just a little careless in his drawing.
In these last illustrations the proposition
that parallels between parallels are equal
is exemplified only as applied to measuring the heights of objects;
but the reader will remember that in Figs. 28 and 29 horizontal measurements
(the widths
of the pathway,

32
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTII^E.
the walls, and the railroad) were detenniued in the same way.
And, indeed, by far the greater number of
measurements which the draughtsman ever has occasion to make
are made by the
application of
this very
simple
I'ule.
Still there are some others in every
di'awing
-which have
to be determined, if at
all, in some
other way
; and it is mainly because
it enables us
to accurately determine measurements
of the kind which
we have yet to consider tliat perspective is to be dignified with the name of a science at all.
These other measurements, which
relate
to what
is known, as
" foreshortening," one
learns by practice
to determine with
considerable accuracy by the eye alone
;
so much
so
that an
artist hardly ever
takes
the trouble
to
fix them
in any other way, excejit
in
the
case of subjects where there
ai-e very pi'onounced
architectural
features.
Even
the
architect
soon learns
to
sketch
his building
so
nearly
right
that only
a few of the more important measurements have
to be corrected by mechanical means
;
but,
as the Ken-
tuckian
felt about
his revolver, which was only for an
occasional emergency, the need of knowing how to
make such corrections is pressing when it actually occurs.
We will consider this part of the subject in a chapter by itself.

CHAPTER
IV.
ANOTHEE CLASS OF IIEASUKEMENTS.—THOSE OBTAINED BY MEANS OF DIAGONALS.
IN
approaching the subject of foreshortening, or the measurement of
lines which run
to a vanishing-point,
we find that here, again, it is possible to divide the subject, and to treat the laying-ofE of actual dimen-
sions—as the length of a house, for instance—in one way, and the dividing of distances already ob-
tained in quite another way
;
one, too, that shall be quicker and more convenient.
In Fig. 40 the house, as a whole, was simply " sketched," which means that the relation of the length to
the depth, and of the height to either of the other two dimensions, was determined by the
unassisted
eye.
Whether any one of these measurements is a little wrong or not is a matter of very small consequence, and any
error of this kind that may exist
in the drawing would probably not be detected, even if the picture were
compared critically with the house itself—on the spot
; but an error in the spacing of the windows would be
quite a different matter.
There are six openings in each story, set regularly along the front of the house, so that the centre lines of
these openings divide the front into seven equal parts
; and the drawing would look badly if these equal
di-
visions did not diminish in regular order as the building recedes from the eye of the observer.
All that was
necessary, however, was to accurately locate
these
six centre
lines, as the windows may readily be sketched
with precision enough
after
this
is accomplished.
• This
is easily done by means of a diagonal across the
house-front.
Everybody knows that if you divide the opposite sides of a parallelogram
in the same way—that
is, in
such a manner that lines connecting the corresponding points
in the two divided
sides
shall be
parallel
to


MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED BY DIAGONALS.
35
each other and to the otlier two sides of the parallelogram—everyhoily knows, or can find out ])y a moment's
reflection, that
these
parallel
lines across the
figure will
divide
its diagonals in
just the same proportion as
that in which the sides are themselves divided.
Now,
ill Fig. 40 the two ends of the front of the house are divided into seven equal parts, and lines con-
necting the points of division divide the diagonal in the same way.
Then vertical lines through the points in
the
diagonal
indicate
the
centres
of
all
the
openings.
It
would have been just as well to divide one end of the house,
and
to draw
the
horizontal
lines to
the
vanishing-point, if
this had
not been so far away that
it would have been more
inconvenient
to use
it than
it was to
divide the other end
of the house.
If the centre of
the door does not seem
to agree with
those of the windows in this drawing,
it
is because the arch-
way projects somewhat beyond
the line
of
the house-front;
for
this reason the doorAvay has
])een omitted
altogether in
the little diagram, which gives the construction of
this illus-
tration by itself.
Measurements may be set off in the same way on any
inclined
line—the edge of a roof, for example—whether you
have occasion to regaixl
it as a diagonal or not.
And such lines are often used in drawing stairways, etc., as
is showai in Fig. 41.
Divisions
of surfaces into any
even number
of parts
are
usually made by drawing both diagonals.
The diagram
in
Fig. 40 shows how these wei'e used
to
locate the
points of the
gables, those in the dormer
windows as well as those in the main roof.
Fig. 42 shows how a surface may be as readily divided into
quarters, eighths,
etc., as into halves, merely
Fig-.
41.

36
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTiyE.
by increasing the number of diagonals.
Now, as you increase the number of these diagonals, by adding those
of the rectangular spaces into which
the surface comes to be divided, you
notice that these diagonals foim
other sets of
parallel
lines which would have
their own vanishing-points
in the
" horizon " of the plane in
which they happened
to
lie.
Carry out the
three diagonals
in
Fig. 42, and
see
if they do not meet
in a
point which
is
directly under the vanishing-point of the horizontal lines.
We shall
find that
this vanishing-point
of diagonals can be made to do
good
service
in determining measurements,
if we only know
to what
kind of fiirures the diaijonals which vanish there belons:.
Suppose, for instance, that you knew the end of the barn in Fig. 42
to
be, leaving
off
the
I'oof, a square.
To
state
it as such would mani-
festly be the
sanie thing
as saying that the lower edge of
it, where
it
rests on the ground, was just as long as either of
its vertical edges.
So
that
it might have been measured
in the first place by drawing the di-
agonal from the top of the nearest vertical edge down to the vanishing-
2:)oint of diagonals, if we had had this point to begin with.
By drawing such another diftgonal from the top of the farther ver-
tical edge
of the building, you would measure
oft' the same length on
the ground-line again, and' the operation might be continued indefinitely,
or at least
until the spaces in your drawing became so small
that you
-could not work any longer.
You would always have something
left to
measure, however, and theoretically you might go on laying
off these dimensions foi-ever.
The ice-houses in
Fig. 43
ai-e measured
in
this way
;
the only
difference between these measurements and those
in
Fig. 42
being
that, the end of each ice-house is twice
as high
as
it
is wide, so that each
diagonal measures
ofE the
width
of two houses.
A horizontal
line
across the houses half-way up the ends of them cuts each diagonal
in two, as explained on page 35, Fig 40.
Fig. 42.

37
The
case
is just
the same whea you have
horizontal squares to deal with
as
it
is with these vertical
ones.
You have only to locate on the pavement, floor, ceiling, or
any other horizontal surface that may be convenient, a figure which
looks as yoxi. tldnk a square ought to looh in that position—one side
of
it forming part of the
line you wish
to measure, and another
side, which joins this one, lying parallel with the horizon.
(Notice
that this is the case in Figs. -42 and 43, where the only
horizon em-
ployed is vertical.)
Do not give yourself any trouble about the proof of this figure
being really a square—we will make that
all
right very soon
;
just
make sure
that the
opposite
sides are
parallel—two of them you
can
draw with
a
" T "
square,
and of course the other two will
go
to
the
vanishing-point
and
your square will do well enough.
Then
draw
the
diagonal
that
would, cori'espond to the one used
in Fig. 42, and, having carried
it
i^
'I r

out to its vanishing-point in the
horizon, go on with the measuring as
in
Fig. 43.
The process is illustrated in Fig. 44.
The squares employed may, of course, have some connection with
the
objects represented, or they may be merely supposed
to
exist
in
oixler

serve a
temporary purpose
in fixing measurements, and

few lueasuring-lines, as shown in Fig. 45.
Tliese little squares are often very useful, too, to get larger meas-
urements by
;
for, supposing their sides to represent
feet, or
any other unit of measurement, you have only to count ofE
as many of them
as you want
in order
to obtain
the
dis-
tance
re-
quired.
Indeed, as
we
shall
see
by
and by, it
CO n s t i
tutes a very convenient and fairly complete "method "
of
pei-spective,
especially
in
the
case
of
figure-pictures,
to
rule off the whole of the ground which
is to show in the
picture
in just such squares
as those
in
Fig. 45, the
ob-
jects represented being
all sketched in \\\\h a free hand,
as can be done
easily enough,
the
squares
furnishing
a
perfectly accurate scale
foi" any part of the picture.
The location of the vanishing-point of diagonals never
need give you
any
trouljle
;
whatever looks right for a
pi'etty good-sized square somewhere in
tlie foreground of
your picture will he right for the rest of the dra\ving.
It need never give you even the trouble of
being too
far away to make its employment convenient, for you can
always get
as long a measurement
as you
wisli without going l)eyond
the edge
of your canvas or paper.
Fig. 46.

MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED BY DIAGONALS.
39
The little diagram at
" A,"
in Fig. 47, shows
that
the vauishiug-point of diagonals may be brought as
near as you please without changing the result, if you ouly reduce the measurement with Avhich you begin
in a corresjjonding degree.
Compare Fig. 46 with Fig. 47
in
this
respect.
The measurements obtained
are just the
same in both
; but the size of the picture might be reduced
to that of the rectangle sketched in the lower right-hand
corner
of the
latter, and even smaller,
if found desirable,
and
the point used
to get
the measurements by
still be
kept inside the frame.
The two vanishing-points
in
Fig. 46
are placed
just
far enough apart so that the measuring-line is the diagonal
of a square, and the measurement with which we begin
—the distance from the' telegraph-pole to the outer
rail
is accurately laid off on the line which runs from one pole
to another.
If we place the two vanishing-points half as
far apart as they are here, then we ought to take only half
of our original measurement to obtain the same result.
If
the distance between the vanishing-points be i-edueed
to
one-fourth, make the given measurement
one-fourth,
too,
and the perspective measurement will be just as correct.
Or, what
is the same thing, you can
leave the
measure-
ment
in the foreground as
it
is, and then the measuring-
line, if drawn to the "half"
point, will measure twice as much;
if drawn to the "quarter" point, four times
as much, and
so
on.
This
is what has been done in Fig. 47.
Now a word or two about the correctness of
the square with which you start.
If you will look at Fig. 45 you will
see that a square in perspective may
Fig. 47-

40
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIVE.
look like almost anything that can be formed with four
lines, if only the opposite
sides are kept parallel
(either actually drawn so or vanishing
to the same point)
; and
if the
figure
is somewhat foreshortened
for, as every slab in the pavement, or every stone in tlie wall (unless the wall face you
exactly, and then
it
can hardly be said to be in perspective), is viewed more or less obliquely,
it must, of course, appear somewhat
foreshortened—how much
it
is
foreshortened
depends
simply on how obliquely it is viewed.
Consequently,
if you
observe
the
conditions
which
have
just been
insisted
upon, you cannot go wrong
in
sketching the
first square of your pavement or wall—you
will
in any case make
it a
possible picture of a perfect
square.
See Fig. 48.
You may make the square too large or too small
; but
that is an error which can easily be corrected
at any time,
and that will Hot have any influence except on the
scpiare
itself, for the vanishing-point of diagonals
is just the same
for big squares as for little ones.
Or you may make the
square too much foreshortened, or too
little
;
but
this
is
merely
a question
of
appearance,
and
has no
reference
whatever to the correctness of the perspective.
For, as the appearance of the square
is determined by the observer's position, and as it is a poor rule
that will not work both ways,
it is equally ti'ue that the observer's position is indicated by the a])pearance of
the square.
If you hap])en to get the square foreshortened more than you intended to have
it, the effect will be to
make the picture look as if the observer were standing farther off than you intended; that is all, and the con-
trary is just as
ti-ue.
In other words, the character
of this
first square, and the general appearance of the
,^..-.---v.-g;U
J'

MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED BY DIAGONALS.
41
picture, which
is detern^ined by
it, are purely and simply matters of design, and
are always treated as such
by architectural and mechanical draughtsmen, as well as by painters.
As a matter of practical convenience, it will be well
to make
this
first square rather large—the whole
width of the room or the
street, perhaps, rather than a single slab in the pavement—-because any slight mis-
calculation which you might make at the outset, regarding what the final result was to be, will in that case be
less and
less apparent as you proceed
to smaller
details, while the same miscalculation in drawing a small
thing would be pretty sure
to
lead
to worse and worse
results
as other and larger oJ/[jcts came to be af-
fected by
it.
-^
'^S/^
Observe, however, that, as far as the use of horizontal squares is concerned, thisraetho(i<^OTV^t^nining
perspective measurements is only applicable to that kind of drawing which we have learned/to know aOjpi^i"-
allel " or "one-point" perspective; but where
vertical squares
are
used, as
in
Figs. 42 sand 43,
it is jusfr-^
general a method as any other.
The I'eason for this limitation is simply this
:
It Is obvious that you can only measufe
in this way lines
that are at right angles to those from Avhich you take the measurements.
It has already been
insisted upon
(page 37), and the jiroof will, I hope, be clear very soon, that these last must be ])arallel with the horizon of
the plane in which they
lie.
It follows, then, that the only lines that will combine with these
in such a way
as to make squares must be those running straight away from the observer, as in
Fig. 48.
But
as any hori-
zontal line is sure to be at right angles to any vertical
one, it makes no difPerence what
its actual
direction
may be.
Now for the reason why the line from which the measures are
taken, which we
will
hereafter call
the " line of measures," must always be parallel with the horizon
of its plane.
All accuracy in work of
this
kind must depend on our having something assured
to begin with.
Things which we know to be really of
a given size seem
to be smaller when they are farther away, and larger when they
are nearer the observer;
but before w^e can exactly determine their apparent size in any jiarticular position we must have some
stand-
ard by wliicii to judge them in all positions—that
is, we must have some place in which measurements which
are alike shall appear alike.

42
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTiyE.
Your experiments with the screen must already have taught you under what conditions this can happen.
It only happens, you will find, when the line in your picture along which
the measurements are taken
has actually the same direction as the
line
in nature which
it
represents.
This is the same thing as saying
that
real and apparent proportions are just the same only when they are
set
off on
lines
parallel
with
the
picture plane; and being
parallel with this plane, they are bound to he parallel to the horizon of the plane in
wliicli they lie.
Prove this for youi-self, however, by actual observation.
The ^vindows in the houses across the street seem, as you look out of your window, to grow smaller and
smallei' as you look farther and
farther down the
street;
Vjut if you
set the
screen
in your own window so
that it is just parallel with those in the other houses, you will find that, measured on the screen.^ the windows
are all of the same width
still.
It is just the same Avitli the vertical distances
; but this does not surprise you as the other probably does.
There
is nothing any more remarkable, however, about one case than the other
; the same observations that
convinced you, the first time you looked through
the
screen, that the pictures of such edges
of objects
as
were
parallel with the screen must have the same direction as the edges themselves, ought also to have con-
vinced you of this other fact, which is of just as much importance, that measurements along such edges are
relatively the same in the picture as they ai-e in the real objects.
And
so you
see why it
is that
vei-tical edges may be divided anywhere, in
any way you
please, as in
Figs. 40 and 43, the geometrical proportions being all right for the pictorial representation of them, and that
any measurements that such
lines may stand for may be transfen-ed
to any horizontal
line by
this
use of
diagonals of squares
; and if you cannot always feel as sure of horizontal or other
lines, or use them in the
same way,
it
is because they are not, as the vertical ones
ai'e, always parallel to your imaginary picture-plane
—your remembered window-screen.
When they are parallel with
it, and the lines to be measured are at right
angles to them, you can do just the same with them as you can with the verticals.

CHAPTER V.
MEASUEEMENT BY MEANS OF TRIANGLES.
IF
the method
of measuring by means of diagonals of squares
is not applicable to every case
that can
possibly arise in the course of a draughtsman's
practice, another and more general statement of what
really amounts
to the same principle will be found to be so
; and
as the greater includes the less, this
other method might have been described in the
first place and
all that has been said about diagonals
omit-
ted,
if the method just explained had not been not only simpler, and
for that reason more convenient when-
ever it was applicable (and
it almost always
is, as
artists
use perspective), but being somewhat
easier
to
understand, its discussion beforehand
serves a very good
purpose.
For it establishes, without much
trouble,
certain points Avhich it is necessaiy for us to know before we face the more general question.
If
in measuring
the windows
in Fig. 40 it had
also been necessary or desirable to determine
the exact
length of the house itself, the reader will see that we have not yet learned enough about perspective to do it
;
there is a way, howevei", of fixing such measures, and this is what we are coming to now.
The width of each window and the length of the house itself
in Fig. 49 were
fixed in this way—at least
they might have been so determined, if the drawing had been made to measure instead of being sketched on
the spot.
The line to be measured
is, in
this
case, the ground
line of the front of the house.
Let us measure its
length first and attend to the windows afterward.
We have seen (page 41) that any measures we may have
occasion to use must be set ofE, if we are to be sure of them, on some line that is parallel to the picture-plane,
and
that such a line is always
parallel
to the horizon
of the plane
in
Avhich
it
lies;
that
is, it
is always
parallel
to
the
oi-iginal
or
actual
horizon when
drawn on
level
surfaces and
always
vertical
or
up-

right when drawn on vertical
surfaces, and so on.
Our observations at the
screen taught us that long ago.
Such a line is drawn, then, in such a position as to have one point
in common with the
line to be measured.
Theoretically' this may be wherever you please, but in practice it will usually be most convenient to draw this
•
imaginary line through the nearest end of the line to be measured.
As it is never used for any other purpose
except to set off "measures on, it may be called the " line of measures."
In some " systems " of perspective
it
is confounded with the bottom of the
picture-plane and thus becomes a source of endless annoyance to the
pupil—and
all for nothing, too—for anybody, can see that the
line has nothing to do with
the picture-plane
except to be parallel with
it.
The two things may be, and often are, on opposite sides of the street
;
indeed,
that is just the case with Fig. 49.
The true length of the house, then—that is,
its length as compared with
its height at the nearest corner
^s laid off in a line drawn on the sidewalk through this nearest comer, and parallel to the horizon.
Now, you see that this " line of measures " is just such a one as was used in Fig. 48, only, in that case, it
and the line to be measured foi-med two sides of a square, while now, as they form an acute angle with each
other, they can only be regarded as forming two sides of a triangle.
But when you think, of
it, the two sides
of the square in Fig. ,48 form with the diagonal a triangle
too.
What, then, is the difference between them ?
There is no difference, unless we choose to make one out of the fact that in Fig. 48 the iriangle has one square
corner, while in
Fig. 49 the corresponding corner is an acute angle
;
in every other respe'ct the two cases are
exactly alike, and, instead of calling the line which gave us the perspective measurement in Fig. 48 the diag-
onal of a square, we might just
as well have called
it
the base of an isosceles triangle which had one
right
angle.
Why, then, may we not adopt the same process
in
Fig. 49 as Avas employed
in Fig. 48, which would
consist in makino; the line to be measured somewhat shorter than the line of measures (for, of course, it would
always be a little foreshortened) by completing the isosceles triangle, the equal
sides of which the two are
supposed to form, by drawing the base
; and then, by carrying out the base to its vanishing-point in the hori-
zon and using this point
to measure everything
else,
make
the
picture
consistent, and therefore
correct ?

so without any trouble
or any doubt

thei-e were only one face to the building
;
and, in fact,
it
is the only really satisfactory ^^ay to do, as soon as
you know how to
reconcile the two
sides of the
building
to each other
;
so
that, when you
lay off your
triangle ou the sidewalk, you know not only that
it
looks pretty well but that it must be correct.
It is pos-
sible to do this
; and its explanation giv^es the key to the wliole matter.
The point which was called the vanishing-point of diagonals in the preceding figures has been called the
vanishing-point of the base of the triangle in Fig. 49 (see the little diagram in the corner).
This name is a good one, because it does not allow the student to forget the real significance of the point,
something which, as every teacher knows, pupils
find it very easy to do
; but it is too long, and we shall have
to
call the point simply
" measuring-jwint "—only do not forget
that
it always
is the vanishing-point
of
the base
of an
isosceles triangle, otherwise
it would not be of the
slightest use
as
a
measuring-point.
If
your pictu]-e necessitates the establishing
of many measurements, you have to regard
it as in good part cov-
ered
\yitljL pictures of isosceles triangles the bases of which all vanish at one or other of these points.
Here-
after, then, we will use the term " vanishing-point " (written V. P.) only as
applied
to
tlie point where the
line to be measured vanishes, and call the vanishing-point of the base of the
triangle the " measurin<'--point"
(written M. P.); and whenever it is found necessary to use more than one
of each
it will be well
to number
them in such away as
to prevent any possible confusion—M. P.

to go with V. P.
1, M. P. 2 with Y.VjJir
and so on.

In some books on perspective the measuring-point is called by one name in dealing with dLiects in " paral-
lel "
pers]iective and by another name
in other
cases
;
but there
is no need
of any such
niuTtiplication of
terms, and in this book no distinction
is made
in
this respect between drawings in \vhich one vanishing-point
is used and those in which lialf a dozen may have been employed.
The location of any measuring-point depends
entirely, as we have seen already
(page 40), on the posi-
tion of the observer.
It is near the vanishing-point when lie is near
his imaginary picture-plane (try
it with
the
sci'een, if you have
any doubts
about
it)
and
farther
off when
his
eye
is more removed from
this
plane, and except for reconciling
the
different

presently),

you cannot go wrong in placing it anywhere you like
;
for, to repeat what was said on page 40, with a change
which
will need no explanation, if you
take
care
to make
that
side
the
shortest which you can
tell by
looking
at
it
is
the one
to be foreshort-
ened, you cannot go wrong
in sketching
your
first
triangle.
Anyone which you
may draw on
the pavement
will be
the
possible
picture of one which
is perfectly
isosceles.
Whether you place the measur-
ing-point
too
near
tlie vauishing-point or
too> far away
is purely a ipatter of appear-
ances.
Fig. 50 and Fig. 51
represent
the
same house, and one
is just
as 'tcorrect
as the other; but the
distance between the measuring-point and the vanishing-point is vei-y much greater in
one of them than in
the
other.
All that
is
to
l|b
said about the result
is, that one pict-
(ir'»«^j^ks ratlier better than the other.
If
it
\\T-re ^lecessary to explain the
dif-
ference in the two
effects,
it would be done
simply by stating that in Fig. 51 the observ-
er
is supposed
to have stepped backward a
few paces
fi'om
the position occupied when
Fig.
50
was
drawn.
But
all
that
the
draughtsman need think about
is the differ-
ence
in
the
effect produced by
the two
pictures,
for
that
is
the
really
important
thing
after
all.
In
drawing
these two illustrations two " lines of measures " have been employed, merely as a matter of conveni-
Fig. 51.

48
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTiyE.
ence.
Such lines may be introduced
at any corner where they are found
to be of use.
The main building
was drawn
first, and
as the end to be measured was square, the line of measures at that point is just as long
as the height of the corner at which
it
is
jilaced.
In
the same way the low building
to
the right
is
three
times as long as the height of
its eaves above the ground, and
so
its
line of measures is three times
as long
as the height of the corner at which it is jilaced.
The difference in the relative lengths of these two
lines, and, indeed, all other differences to be found in
comparing the two drawings, arise from the difference in the placing of the measui'ing-point
; for when this is
once settled everything else is determined by
it.
Now let us see about the relation of the two sides of the building to each other.
Turn back to Fig. 49 and look at the end of the house.
You see it has only been sketched, the measure-
ments being guessed at.
How, then, do we know that this part agi-ees with the front of the building and that
the whole is in true pei'spective ?
We do not know, but we can very soon find
out.
In order to do this with absolute precision, however, and I hope the reader would not be contented with
anything less, it will be necessary to analyze the drawing a little, and, by reference to our experimental win-
dow-screen, to establish the conditions under which the picture was made.
The conditions are best represented by the screen on which you have been drawing with chaTk,' but
Fig.
52, which is virtually a picture of that contrivance, will do pretty well, and
it is desirable
to have something
in the book to refer to as we go along.
The broken glass will answer pretty well
in place of the window-
screen, and the open box instead of your neighbor's house.
The box
is painted on the
glass just as
it
looks to
this observer, and
its lines having been carried out
untilthey
cut the horizon
of
the picture, the points which are fixed
in this way are found to just cover the
points on the
actual
horizon (away out
to
sea, you know) toward which
the
lines
of
the box seem to be
pointing.
Only one of these vanishing-points in
the actual
hoi'izon is shown in the
illustration, for the reason that

MEASUREMENT BY MEANS OF TRIANGLES.
49
the other one would be so far away as to make the illustration inconveniently large if it were introduced
; but
if it were shown, it would be found to bear exactly the same relation to the one
in the picture (Y. P. 2)
as
the one which is represented bears to V. P.
1.
The lines running from the box
to
the observer's eye and to his feet have
been used
to make the pict-
Ae^uctl '^Sovizpn.
Fig.
52-
ure
of the box on the
glass accurate.
You
can make
out how this was done
if you
care enough
about
understanding it to study the dra^V'ing
a
little, but you need not take the trouble to do so unless you are so
minded.
The only thing which
it is really necessary for you to know
is, that the two lines from the observer's eye
(S. P.) to V. P.
1 and V. P. 2 have exactly the same direction as have
the horizontal edges of the box itself.

50
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIVE.
SE
Now, as it is a square-coi'iiered box, these two lines must form a right angle at the station-point.
And we
shall find that they do so in the
picture if we can get such a view of them as will enable us to judge what
their true direction
is.
You prove this easily enough with the bits of thread in front of your window-screen,
but we cannot do
it quite
so readily in
this
representation
of
it.
If, however, you will
take hold
of
the
threads at
the
station-point and, without
allowing them
to
slacken or change
their
lengths
in any way, will
let them
turn on V. P. 1 and V. P. 2 as if they were hinges until the
threads lie flat on the screen, as shown
in
Fig. 53, and will
then lay the screen itself
flat on the table, you will have the
same condition of things on your screen that Ave have in Fig.
54
;
so
that, while
the
direction of
your
threads
remains
relatively unchanged, the picture
will now answer
just
as
well as
the screen
to talk about and make our demonstra-
tion by.
You Avill see that on this diagram (Fig. 54) the isosceles
triangle which
Avould be
used to
measure
the
perspective
length
of the
longest
side
of the box has been added
;
its
base has been continued to its vanishing-point in the horizon
and a line draAvn from this point to the station-point, which
line, as we have just
seen, must be
jiarallel with the actual
base of the triangle.
Now, then, we
liave
all
tlie necessary conditions of a perspective problem accurately
stated on the paper.
It
is not
])y any means necessary that
this statement should be based upon
actual
measurement
of the object and
its position, as books on perspective usually say
it
is.
But
it
is necessary,
when the correctness of the
jierspective comes
to
l)e demonstrated—to fix the
station-point, and
to fix it in
such a manner
that
it
shall bear the same
i-elation to tlie
lines and
points on the
picture as that indicated

in Fig.
54.
This is not a
difficult matter
at
all, and may be determined without once thinking about the
obsei'ver's distance from either the picture or the object.
Let us see what the recjuirements really are.
In the
first place it
is necessary, when you have, as you
usually do
in representing
buildings, a square-cornered
object to draw, to have the
station-point so placed

54
that the
lines drawn from
it
to the vanishing-points shall form a right angle with each other
; and in the
second
place,
tJoe station-point must
be just as farfrom either vanishing-point as the corresponding measur-
ing-point is.
You see that this will always have to be so because, as the horizon of the picture is parallel to one side of
the isosceles triangle on the pavement and the lines from the station-point are parallel with the other two, the

ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIVE.
fig.
55-
three lines on or in front of the picture must form an isosceles triangle also,* and that tlie line to the measur-
ing-point is the base of it, so that the other two must be of the same length.
This is the whole
story, and
if
we adjust any drawing which we may happen to have in hand to
these conditions we need
not
have
any
doubts
about
its
correctness.
Let us turn back and do
this
with
the
house
in
Fio-.
49.
I
have
said
that
it
is
possible
to
draw
one
side
of
the
house without going into the questions which we have just been
discussing.
Suppose we
draAv
the
side which
is measured
in
Fig. 49, fixing the measuj'ing-point at random and making the
line of measures represent the known relation
between the height of the nearest corner and the length of the house, with the result shown in Fig. 55.
Now this may be a per-
fectly accurate measurement
for this
side.
Next
let us
draw the other
side
by
it-
self,
as
in
Fig.
56,
which,
considered by itself, may be
perfectly
accurate
too,
al-
though the measuring-point

at raudoui
as the other one was.
Now let us
see
if they will go together as they

ought.
Carry out the lines in the first one to their vanishing-point as in Fig. 57, and those in the other as in
Fig. 59-
Fig. 58.
The nearest vertical
line
in the house being common to both drawings, you can readily detei-mine

54
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIVE.
the position of
the
vanishing-point which remains to be found in either case by measuring
its distance from
this line along the horizon.
Do this, and establish both vanishing-points on both drawings, as
in Fig. 59 and
Fig. 60.
Having done
this,
it will be easy enough to
fix on each picture the station-point
as it would have
to be in order to have the picture look as it does.
For, as the corner of the house is a light
angle, and
as
Fig. 6o.
everybody knows that any angle inscribed
in a semicircle is sure to be
a
right angle (if he has any doubts
about it he must brush up his geometry to
the extent of satisfying
himself), we have only
to draw a semi-
circle connecting the two vanishing-points, and are
sure that the
station-point must be somewhere in
this.
Then as we know that the station-point
is just as far from the vanishing-point as the measuring-point
is, we
lay off
this distance on
the
semicircle with the compasses, and that gives us all we want to know.
All the

MEASUREMENT BY MEANS OF TRIANGLES
55
points that could possibly be used have been
established, and the accuracy of our
original sketch may be
demonstrated to our heart's content.
Now let us put the pictures of the two
sides
together and see
if they agree
; that is, let us see if the
point from which each
side must have been seen to look like this would be right for the other side too.
If
Fig.
6i.
you make a careful tracing of
either drawing, and apply it to the other, you will obtain the result shown in
Fig. 01, which is as complete a reductio ad ahsnrdum as anyone could wish, for the station-point certainly can-
not be in both these places at once.
To correct the drawing of the house as a whole, it is necessary either to
retain one of these station-points, and, leaving one-half as it
is, make the
rest of the drawing conform to
it,
or to take a new station-point altogether.

56
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIVE.
This last is usually the best way, because, by taking the station-point about half-way between the two,
you do less violence to your original design than would result froua the other course.
This form of correction
has been applied here, and the result is shown in Fig. 62.
Of course, if the base
of the triangle measures the whole object correctly, lines
parallel
to the base will
Fig. 62.
\
measure any details and divisions just as correctly, so
that nothing more need be said" about the windows in
Fig. 49
; and as
it makes no
difference whether the
triangle
is
hoi'izontal or vertical, this method may be
applied to such lines as those in the roof in Fig. 63, just as Avell as to tlie horizontal lines of the house.
If you should
liave occasion
to make
the corner of a building something
else instead
of a
scjuare one,

MEASUREMENT BY MEANS OF

57
you can
always manage
it by comparing it witli a
square corner,
as
will
be explained
in the chapter on
curves, or you will
see in the
chapter on methods a way of drawing any kind
of
a
figure, no matter how
irregular, by an easy application of the principles of parallel jDerspective.
I have
a suspicion
that, in
spite of
all my assurances about the
correctness of the
squares, imaginary
or other, on which we have learned to depend foi- a large part of our perspective measurements, a good many
readers will still
lie haunted by doubts about them.
How do we know, they may have
said
to themselves
moi-e
than
once
already,
that

house

after
all
'i
Why may
it not have been an oblong pretty nearly square, perhaps, but
still not quite equilateral
I
The figure which was sketched on the ground to
start the measuring by may have
been a square, but
it may also have been an oblong, and had we wanted it to be one we
should have drawn
it in precisely the same way.
How, then, shall we know which one
our drawing represents
?
Our experience with the two
sides of
the house in Fig. 49
i
will help us out in this case as well.
Every square lias two diagonals, which cross each other at right angles.
And any-
body can see, l)y looking at the diagrams which we have just been using, that if the one
dia2;onal used
in
Fiof. 50 vanishes where
it does
in M. P., the other one would vanish
just as far to the other side
of the vanishing-point
at the end
of
the house
(V. P.)
;
and, having found the
vanishing-point of the other diagonal, we could
locate the
statidn-point
in this case
in very much
the same
way as we did
in the other (see Fig. 62).
Then we should be able
to prove that the picture of the end of
the house represented a perfect square, as seen from this station-point.
Seen from any other
it would, of
course, represent an oblong just as correctly, and we could determine
the precise character of the oblong just as well
as we can demonstrate the squareness of this figure, if we had
accurate data concerning
it.
For the lines which meet in the station-point, as they stand for the actual
direc-
tions of the diagonals of the
figure represented, must meet at the same angle as that at which the diagonals
Fig. 63.

58
FSSENTIALS OF PERSPECTiyE.
cross.
Knowing what this angle
is, we could locate our measuring-points and set off the length of the sides
of the oblong just as correctly as we have those of the square.
One word more about the
station-point in Fig. 50, and we are done.
I said we could locate it in " very
much " the same way as we did the one in
Fig. 62.
"Very nmch, but not
quite.
Very much more readily,
perhaps, but in a way that may require a little explanation, all the same.
Suj)pose we had found both measuring-points in this illusti-ation, then one of tliem would be just as far
to one side of V. P. as the other one was to the other side
; which
is the same
thing as saying that the ob-
server must be standing directly in front of V. P.
Satisfy yourelf about this, if you have any doubts, either
by looking at the
picture or by experimenting with your
screen.
The
station-point,
then, must be
in a
semicircle connecting the two measuring-points and must be directly opposite V. P.
The distance from V. P. to the station-point will, you see, be just the radius of the semicircle, and if our
drawing had been based on assumptions of actual distances, or even on real measurements instead
of on ap-
pearances, we might have
set down our V. P. anywhere
;
laid off
the line
to the
station-point of the
right
length
; drawn our semicircle, and so on, and this is the way it is often done.

THE PERSPECTIVE OF CURVES.
THE
I'cadcr nntlCTstiinds by
tliist time Iiow imicli easier
it
Is to draw squares, or at least rectanp^ular figures,
ill
|)erspective than any others; and, as a matter of fact, everything else is usually drawn by means of
such figures.
It is usual, for instance, to enclose a circle or any other regular, ciu'ved form in a s([uare,
as in
Fig.
04, or in an oblong, as in
Fig. 65, and, having drawn
these

You can
in
(his way obtain as many points
as you
need, and can
then
sketch the
(•ui'V(i through them
accurately enough.
Tn the cases of
th(( circle
as shown
in
Fig. 04,
it makes
no
difference whether the square
is in "])arallel " pers])ec-
tive or not;
the
residt will in any case be an ellipse and
it
will always be a level
ellipse,
if the circle represented
is
level
in
reality and
is
dinsctly
in front
of
the
eye.
Figs. G6 and 67 show a
circle above the eye drawn in
squares in diJferent
positions,
but the results, as you see,
ai'c precisely
tins same.
A good deal of energy has ])een wasted

a circle really was an ellipse or not, and

help
the
reader
to remember nnder what
conditions a
circle in perspective, or any part
of
one, becomes
any kind
of
a curve other than an
ellipse.
It
is,
I hope, not
necessary to
say, that Avhen
the
circle
is vertical and parallel with your picture-plane, the
representation if it is still a true circle, as shown by
the
cart-wheel
in
Fig.
1.
But
in any
other
case
where the whole
circle can be seen in the
picture,
it appears as an ellipse.
To anyone standing on
tlie circle that part of
it which comes into his
picture is a jiarabola
;
and,
if he is
fairly inside the
circle, what he sees on
his
picture is a hyperbola.
Remembering
this, the student will always sketch his
circle accurately enough if he
fixes the width of his ellipse as compared with its length by first drawing, a square in the place where it is to go.

Disliking
this
effect, drauglitsraen
sometimes
take
a
little
liberty
with
the
jierspective,
and
" straighten up "
the
ellipse
as
in
Fig. 73.
This often has a good efEect, and indeed seems to be almost
necessary in
the
case of
horizontal
circles, such
as
the tops
of columns and towers, but
it
is of doubtful
utility as applied
to vertical
circles, as
the reader will
admit who compares the two drawings
of
a pulley
given in Figs. 72 and 73.
Sometimes,
however,
in
dra-\ving
the
under
side
of
arches the effect
of
the
true
perspective
representation
is
decidedly
offensive, and the
error, for such
it
really
is, of
drawing a vertical ellipse instead of an oblique one, has to
be introduced.
Whether to do
so or not is a question for
the di'aughtsman's good sense—artistic sense—to determine.'
Angular
figures, other than rectangular
ones, may be
drawn
in the same way
as
those which
are bounded by
curves, by drawing square or rectangular shapes around or
through them and measuring on
the sides of the latter the
points where the other figures touch, or cut them.
The obtuse angle of
a
building, for instance, as at A,
Fig. 74, might
be drawn
easily enough
by means
of the
square.
You have only to draw the square
in perspective
and measure ofB the points A and B on
its sides, so that you do not need to trouble yourself to
find
either
the vanishing-point or the measuring-point of the line AB.
A better way, however, to do anything
of
this
kind will be found in the chapter on methods.

CHAPTER
VII.
A
A QUESTION OF METHODS.
N artist's knowledge of the mathematics of perspective is a good deal like
a poor man's money in the
savings bank.
He wants
to be
sure
of
it, and
is
anxious
about it if he is not, but
he has
little
use for
it
fi'om day to day.
Oc-
life
casionally he makes a little draft upon his
capital fund
to help him out of some im-
mediate difficulty, but the bulk of
his for-
tune may, and ought
to, remain untouched
most of the time.
But
it
is different with the
architect
or the mechanical draughtsman.
Plans and
elevations drawn
to
scale
have, in their case
to be transformed into
perspective
representations
Ijy
a
more or
less mechanical application
of the
princi-
ples which
have
been
considered
in
the
preceding
chapters.
There
are
several
different methods,
fairly
distinct, of mak-
ing this application.
Which one is most convenient in any particular case the draughtsman's own judgment
must determine.
Fig. 75-

64
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIVE.
The one to which the most prominence is usually given in elementary works, of assuming the horizon, the
station-point, and the size and position of the object, arbitrarily, and letting the effect take care of itself, is the
most mechanical, and least satisfactory.
The better Avay usually,
is to make a free-hand
sketch, giving, as nearly as
possible, the proportions of
the object and indicating, at any i-ate, the desired effect.
By going over this sketch, as Fig. 49 was gone over
in a preceding
chapter, the
necessary data
for
an
accurate
drawing
are
easily and
quickly
obtained,
and
the
draughtsman
has the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
result
something
like the one intended,
a
thing
which
he
is by
no means
sure
of
when,
working in the other way.
The
di'aughtsman who
has ever had
occasion
to
construct
some such drawing
as that shown in Fig.
77, having no other
data than
those
furnished,
let us
say, by
a photograph looking something like Fig.
75, taken from another point of view than
one
desired, and encumbered with shrub-
bery which
he wishes
to
leave
out, and
who,
after much plotting and planning and
" assuming "
of
station-points,
has
obtained a result some-
thing like that
in
Fig.
76,
finds
little consolation
in
the
certainty
that
his
production
is
in
true
per-
spective.
Fig. 77 is just as
correct, and looks
a great
deal
better, simply because
it was made
over
a
sketch
which was approximately right to begin with.

A QUESTION or METHODS.
65
But even
\\\n'.n
tlii.s
point
i-egardiiig
the
general
metliotl
of
procedure
is settled, there
are
difFereiit
ways of going altout a drawing, some of
tliein being best suited
to one
class of work and some
to
anotlior.
The draughtsman's own good sense must determine which method
is best in any particular case.
You may, if you choose, find the vanishing-point and the corresponding measuring-point for each set of
lines
in
your drawing—the
oldique
ones, as well as those
which
arc horizontal
or vertical— or, by refer-
ring to your elevation and
plan, you can reduce everything
to a
c^uestion of
relative heights and
of meas-
urements on the ground.
As heights
are
always the easiest measurements
to deter-
mine—no other calculations than those ap-
parent at a glance in any of the
first illus-
trations used in this book ])eing required
it
Avill not be necessary to say any more
about them.
Confining
ourselves,
then,
to
the
di-
mensions measured on the ground or floor,
Ave
shall
see that it
Is always
j)OSsible
ei-
ther
t(j draw and measure each
line by
it-
self, involving the use of just as many van-
ishing-points
as there are directions, or, by establishing a certain nuraV>er of measurements on lines wiiich run
directly into
the
picture, fix
all the corners
separately,
it being an easy uiatter to connect them afterward
without regard to where the
lines connecting them would vanish.
This method has the double advantage of
enabling you
to represent
oV^jects in any position, without going outside the
limits
of your picture to
find
vanishing points, and
to
locate any point by reference
to your geometrical
jtLui
or elevation alone, without
regarding the rest of the picture.
Fig. 78 has been dra^vu in this way,
ea(;ii corner of the ground-plan being
located by itself by means of one measuring-point (the vanishing-point of diagonals of the square), and each

A QUESTION OF METHODS.

height measured
separately by means of
the one vanishing-point.
This brings the whole subject down to a
question of " parallel " perspective, as you see, and
to using
the one vanishing-point which we have learned
(Chap.
I.)
to
call
the
centre
of
vision.
Remember,
however,
that
this
does
not mean
that
the
point

79.
Fig.

Fig.
81.
is
necessarily in
the middle of your paper or canvas, but only that
it is supposed
to be
directly in
front of
the observer's position, and so the centre of all that he sees.
Another advantage
to be derived from employing
this method
is, that you can try difEerent
effects by
varying the position of the geometrical
plan, as shown
in
Figs.
79,
80, and 81—the
necessary data being
furnished by the plan and elevations. Fig. 82, and
each height established as
in Fig. 83.
Only, of course, it
makes no difEereuce in
this last
opei'ation whether the line showing
the real
height
is set up
at A and the

parallels drawn to CV, or the height given at B and the
parallels drawn to the measuring-point
;
all that is
necessary being
that
parallels should be measured by parallels.
If
the reader objects that
in
these
cases
the
measuriug-point comes
a good way off, he
is reminded that
he can
bring
it as
near as
lie
likes by remembering what was said on page
3'J and
illustrated by Figs.
40 and 47.
Another good way to do, and one which ^vil^ be found more convenient than the
last when the plan
is at all complicated,
is to measure off the edges of the ground plan
by means of the vanishing-point and the measuring-point belonging to eacli set of lines,
but making the measurements much easier to fix by putting them well below the object.
If the reader will
tui-n ])ack to Fig. 51 he will understand
the significance of
this.
The measuring here is all done within
such narrow limits, and the lines cross each other at such sharp
angles, that it I'equires great care to make the drawing accurate.
It would
have
been much more convenient
to put
the
measurements well out of the way, by extending the
vertical
lines downward and
constructing
a
perspective
plan,
as has
been done in Fig. 84.
In architectural work this method has
the advantage, also, of allowing any number
of alternative treatments of the building to be represented -without the trou-
ble of redi-awiug the plan every time
;
for this can
be on another piece of
paper, if you like.
In ease the multiplicity of roofs of such
subjects
as
this should ever
give the student any trouble, the construction of dormers
is
explained in
Figs. 85 and
8(5.
The
first one
applies
to
such dormers as
are shown in
this illustration
(Fig. 84), where only one
vanishing-point
is used, and
the other one shows what
to
do
in
case you have to employ more of these points.

ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIl^E.
This method
of the
jierspective plan
is a very good one when ^oii have jiolygonal
or circular
sti'uc-
tures
to draw, like that in Fig. 87, let us say.
By setting your geometrical elevation
side by side with the
perspective view, you can carry the heights
across from one to the other with a rule
or " T " square.
This
will give all the heights on some one vertical plane, and you can
then
transfei- them backward
or forward
in
the* picture
in
the way
that
has
already been
explained.
In
Fig. 87
the
lines
of
the hexagons

if
their vanishing-points had ])een

it Mas

as
it would
have, been to draw
squares, but
the whole drawing could have been made with one vanishing-point
just
as well.
Fig. 88 shows the same
method
applied
to
an-
other
kind
of
buildinof.

however,
I 1)eg the reader
not
to
trouble
himself
about them, as anything of
this kind can be done just as accurately by
means of an
application of parallel perspective which
is presently to be
explained, and which is the one usually made use of by artists where a
Fig- 90-
good many objects have to be located and their sizes indicated.
By
looking
at
Fig.
89, you
will
see
that
almost
any problem
that
is
likely
to
arise
in
an
artist's
practice can be solved by means of one-point perspective.
You have only to make a geometrical plan of your
subject, cover it with squares as big or as little as you choose, and, having put these squares into perspective,
as
is shown
in

CHAPTER
VIII.
SHADOWS.
IF
our thoughts have so far been occupied with
the outlines of objects rather than with such elements of
pictoi'ial effect as are furnished by shadows^ and reflections, it
is not because less importance is attached
to the latter, but simply because it is npt possible to think about everything at
once.
And
as the sub-
ject must be divided somewhere, it has been thought best to limit our inquii'ies, at first, to "those things which
are most obviously elementaiy, aud
to take up afterward those which great numbers of drawings have to do
without altogether.
As a matter of
fact, the shadow is Usually of more importance, fi'om a pictorial point of view, than the
outline, and I cannot help thinking that it
is a great mistake to separate the two in practice, as
it
is common
to do in drawing-schools.
From the very first, pupils should be taught to see that it is the shadow that shows the form, and that it
is only by drawing this that the character of the object is expressed.
Drawings made' in outline are diagrams, not pictures, and no one can be said to know how to draw imless
he grasps the laws which govern the representation of shadows as well
as
those which stand for the shapes
of things.
The study of the light and shade
o)i
oT)jects hardly comes within the province of our ju-esent investiga-
tion, but
the perspective of the shadows which they cast forms, not only one
of the most
interesting and
instructive branches
of our subject, but
it
is
also one of the easiest to understand and
apjily, as the same
rays of
light which
cast them
measiu-e
theiu
also, and the vexations
of separate measuring-points are
all
avoided.

SHADOIVS.
75
so
It
is hoped that the
illustrations
to
this
chapter will, for
the
most
part, explain
themselves, and
render unnecessary any other explanation than that which a kind
of running commentary on them will be
found to furnish.
The direction and length of the shadows of the posts in
Fig. 92 vary, of course, with the time of day
;
but one
of them being
di-awn, the
others
are
easily made
to conform
to
it.
The
oblique
lines
throuo'h
the tops of the posts are rays of sunlight which, being parallel
too, have
their own
vanishing-point, which
HoF'iZOV

is
quite
independent of
any other that would be employed
in
the
picture.
These
lines would
measure
the shadows
of
the
posts
if
they
were
not
all measured
at
once by
a
line through the ends
of them
pai'allel
to the rail.
Notice this shadow of the rail, and remember the lesson which it has to teach
;
namely,
that
:
The shadow of a line on a surface to which it is parallel is ahoays parallel to the line itself.
Notice, also,
that what is true of the
horizontal
line
in this
illustration
is just as true of the vertical

ESSENfULS OF PERSPECTIl^E.
one
in Fig.
93.
Notice,
also,
in both of
these, as well as in the one which follows, Fig. 94, how well the
character
of the
surface on which the shadow falls
is expressed by the shadow, and do not forget that all
the outlines you can ever draw will not convey half as good an impression of a surface as a single shadow
falling aci'oss it.
Fig.

What was just noted about
lines is manifestly just as true of shapes, and our
fir.st rule may readily be
made to j-ead as follows
:
The shadow of any plane f,(jure on a surface io vhich
It h parallel U a similar fi(jure.

Where
the shadow
is cast Ly
sunlight,
it
is not only similar to the line or shape which casts
it, but it
is of just
the same
size.
When
it
is cast by artificial
light, however, the shadow grows larger as the
sur-
face on which it falls is farther removed.
The shadow of a
line on a surface with which
it
is
at
rifdit
angles chano-es with the direction of the
rays of light, and so furnishes a pretty accurate indication of the position of the sun.
You can see this very
nicely in
Fig. 02 and in Fig. 96.
Fig- 97-
Fig. 98.
Fig. 97 shows the shadows
of
lines on
surfaces to which they are
parallel, on
those with which they
are at right angles, and on those to which they are oblique.
Test the width of the shadow on the wall by drawing rays of light through the corners of the shutter,
and, having found their vanishing-point, 'see if the shadow on the curtain inside the window is of
the
right
width.
'
Fig. 98 shows the shadows of oblique lines on
t^vo surfaces at
once.
Go over
it, drawing with a ruler
lines which
represent the rays of
light, and
see if the shadows of the rounds of the ladder agree with that
of the little roof over the window.

78
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTII^E.
Go over Fig. 99 in the same way, and see if you can find out how the position of the shadow of each
object and angle was determined
; for they were all determined by means of a ruler.
The shadows of a few points can be found
easily enough
in
Fig. 100 by applying the
results of our
observations on the preceding illustrations, and the shadow sketched accurately enough through these.
Of
course, you
will enclose the
circle in a square, as has been done with the
horizontal
circle beside

it, and draw an ellipse that will fit into the shadow of the square, and so make the shadow of
tlie circle very
accurate
; but it is hardly necessary to fix more than two or three points in the shadow.
You ought, however, to be
able
to draw the shadow
of a horizontal
circle and of a vertical one
as
they appear on the wall
in
this
illustration.
These were drawn with the rays of light falling
at the same
angle for both, but you see they are very much alike, notwithstanding
the
difference in the
position of the
circles.
One shadow is a little narrower and " steeper " than the other
; and that is about all the difference
to be seen between them.
If you remember about how they lot)k, a'ou can sketch any such apjilication of

79
either
of them
as
is shown
in Fig. 101
i-eudily and
confidently enough.
As shadows always become the
most conspicuous part of the plane on which they fall,
it does not need
to be pointed out that
their van-

in
the

if
this surface has to be partly an imaginary one.
Fig.
103 shows how such
a shadow
is
fol-
lowed when the object casting
it
has to be lengthened in imagination
in order to enable us to determine its
direction.
If we looked into the matter a little more deeply—and it is necessary to do so in order to understand any
but the most elementary facts of appearance—we should find that every line casts in space a plane of invisible

shadow, as
it
is
called, though
it becomes visible on the dust or mist that sometimes
fills the room
or the
street
; and
it
is the intersection of
this plane
of shadow with some other
surface
that forms the visible
shadow.
This plane of
invisible shadow is, then, to be treated just like any opaque flat surface
;
it may have
its own horizon and as many vani.shing-points
in
it
as may be called for.
Fig. 104 shows such a plane when
it is parallel with the plane of the picture, so that the edge where it cuts the ground
is j^arallel with the
ho-
rizon and has, consequently, no vanishing-point.
In Fig. 105 this line has a vanishing-point.
Notice that the

shadow oil the ground, which, of
course, lies
in both
these
planes, has
its vanishing-point
in both their hori-
zons, just as we saw must be the case with the edges of the roofs in Fig. 20 (page 17).
This illustration (Fig. 105) shows the shadow as it looks when tlie light conies from l)ehind the observer,
but it may just as well come from somewhere in front of him, and then the case will be as shown in Fig. 106.

this matter

or

The method of fixing the shadows of separate points is shown in Fig. 108.
The dotted verticals belong to the plane in which the oblique line is situated, while those on the ground
and wall are the lines where the planes of
invisible shadow would cut the ground or the wall.
The oblique
lines in the air by which these last are cut off in the right place are rays of light.

Fig. 109
shows the
effect obtained when
the
most important factor
in the efPect
is
a mass
of
light
bounded by shadows, instead of the reverse.
Go over it, and make sure that thei'e is no mystery about
it.
Where there
is an
artificial light to deal with,
instead of the sun or moon, the rays radiate instead of
being parallel to each other, that is all
; no two planes of invisible shadow
can,
then, ever be parallel if cast
by artificial light.

niiplication of
the same
principles.
It will explain itself to
anyone who cares enough about the subject to study it with a little care.

CHAPTER
IX.
REFLECTIONS.
THE
laws governing reflections are very few and very simple, hut for want of understanding them, such
as they are, the beginner often gives himself a good deal of trouble about them.
It is only necessary to remember that any point
in an object which
ap])ears
in
reflection seems
to be just as far beyond or below the reflecting surface as the point itself is on this side of or above
it.
This is really the whole statement of
the
matter, and any question
that may ever arise concerning the
perspective of reflections might be settled by the application of this rule alone.
As the establishing of any great number
of
points might become
a somewhat
tedious
process, how-
ever,
even
if
carried on
in imagination
only,
other
rules may be deduced from
this
one,
or rather
the
truth which
this one
expresses may be put
in
other forms whose
application
to
pictures may seem
to be
more direct.
A moment's thinking will
enable anyone to put
it
into
this form, for instance
: The
reflections of lines
which are either parallel with the
reflecting surface or
at right angles to
it have just the same vanishing-
points as
the
lines themselves, and
if they have
the same vanishing-points, of course they have
the same
measuring-points, and the
reflection has no other influence on the lines than simply to extend
or
to double
them
(see
Figs. 114 and
115)
;
and
as far as
lines
alone
are
concerned
this
is
perhaps enough
to
say
about them,
for
in
the case
of those which
are oblique
to the
reflecting
sui'face one
point can be
estab-
lished
in the
reflection
of
each, by
the method
illustrated
in
Fig. 74, page 62, and the proper vanishing-
point found by extending the
line to its horizon, as is done with any other line.
Even this
is
not necessary

85
vmless one
lias
to draw several such
lines Avbicli are
parallel, for the location of the end of the reflection is
all that
is needed
(see
Fig. 116).
If
this
is the whole truth about the
reflections
of points and
lines,
is
there anything
else that requires explanation
?
There can hardly be anything, unless
it be the fact that
surfaces which are visible in the object are often wanting in the reflection, and vice versa, either because the
surface which is reflected
is the
reverse
of that which
is in sight on the object, or because one of them
is

concealed by some intervening object.
If, then, we were to examine
these
last statements a little in detail,
we should probably exhaust the subject.
Fig. 114 illustrates the first one well enough, and
of those that follow it all exeept
Figs. 115, 116, and
117 illustrate both.
Fig. 116 shows that the
modifications
in
the appearance
of
the object
reflected which are produced
by the
first of
these
influences may be
considerable.
(The

ment, because the top of the board
is not in sight, but anybody can see that it might just as well have been,
and the indulgent reader will excuse the discrepancy.)
For what we see in the reflection is obviously what we should
see in
the reality if the eye were just as
far on the
other
side of
the mirror as
it happens
to
be ou
this.
This
is expressed diagrammatically
in
Fig. 118.

What
the wayfarer who
is
here
represented sees
in the water is just what he would see out of
it
if
his eye were
as far below the surface (at A) as it actually is above
it.
Fig. 119 shows exactly what
this amounts to, and
Fig. 120
emjjhasizes both
the statements which the
diagi-am has been made
to
illustrate,
for by showing what would be seen in reflection if the bit of
inter-
vening wall wei'e removed
it makes more apparent the
difference
in the appearance
of the object which is
caused by reversing
it.

its vanishing-point, it is easy to draw another one parallel with
it and
di-
rectly under it on the surface of the water, as if the water were extended
indefinitely, and the post standing
in the water
;
then the case of the post is precisely like that in Fig. 115.

in

CHAPTER
X.
CYLINDRICAL OR CURVILINEAR PERSPECTIVE.
IN
all
the examples wliich Lave
hitherto been given the picture has been regarded as a vertical plane, so
that all vertical lines appear vertical in the picture.
Wh^i, however, you draw things as they appear
when you are looking up
at any considerable
elevation, or downward
at objects at any great depth
below the eye, you notice the convergence
in
parallel vertical
lines just as much
as
in any others, and may,
perhaps, feel
inclined
to
represent them
so.
In
that case you are simply regarding your picture-plane as
tilted one way or the other, so that vertical lines, being no longer parallel with
it, they, too, have a vanishing-
point which you
locate just
as you have learned
to do with others; that is, by sketching any two of a
set,
and carrying them out
until they meet, taking care
that the
I'est of
the
jiicture is made
to agree with this
part.
This condition exists as a
possibility, but
jn'oliably no one ever had
occasion to work out a drawing
in
this way except as a curiosity, and so it can hardly be necessary to go into details of the process here.
But the case of very long horizontal lines, which seem in nature
to have vanishing-points
at both ends,
is of somewhat more importance, as its recognition frequently modifies very appreciably an artist's treatment
of his picture.
Figs. 124 and 125 will make this clearer than any amount of explanation in Avords could do.
The actual
relations existing between the objects represented
are shown
in
Fig. 124;
that is, the three
houses
are
all
in a row.
The lines of one have precisely the same directions
as those of each of the others,
and the fronts of all three are parallel with the fence.
But the eye
is the most
restless
of
oi-gans, and undoul)tedly we should
see something a good deal like

CYLINDRICAL OR CURVILINEAR PERSPECTIl^E.
91
what is shown iu Fig. 125
if we occupied the position which the
])hotograplier did when he took the view
from which that drawing has been made.
Something like it, but with this difference
:
our eyes would be continually moving, so that the long lines
would appear curved, whereas the camera was allowed
to remain in one
position until one impression was
Fig.
124.
recorded, and then turned in another
direction, to remain fixed a little Avhile longer—the
result of which
is
a series of separate and distinct impressions regarding the objects before us.
Now, there can be no doubt about the truth of this last picture, when the conditions under which it was
made are understood.
As has just been said, it was drawn from a photograph, and
it undoubtedly records just what the ob-
server, who happened also to be a photographer, actually saw.

92
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIVE.
No greater changes were made
iu the position of the camera in taking the picture than the
observer's
head underwent in looking- at the view.
But looking at views
is not making pictures, and the question arises
as
to which is the true picture of
T^

the place
after
all.
By which
is meant: Which
picture produces on the observer's mind
the impression
most like that which the place itself would produce?
The impressions recorded in Fig. 125 form, not one picture, but a series of pictures, made on the inside of
a polygonal prism, the surface of which
is " developed," or reduced, to a
flat surface afterward.
If the im-
pressions were continued without interruption, the record of them would have to
l)e made on the inside of a
cylinder which, being unrolled, would give curves where Fig. 125 shows jointed straight lines.
Tlie conditions under which the objects represented would
in
that case be
studied, and a comparison
of the same with those under which perspective drawings are usually made, are
indicated
in
the diagrams
which follow.
Fig. 120 shows the relation existing between a row of arches with
square piers, the eye of an observer,

and a picture-plane fixed as was tlie window-screen described and illustrated in
tlie first chapter.
The dotted
lines running from the piers to the
station-point show just how wide each pier would have to be in the
pict-
ure;
and, of course, the reader does not need to be told that the piers would all be drawn of the same height,
so that the effect would be somethincr like that in Fig. 130.
Now, suppose we were to sid)stitute for the picture-plane employed in Fig. 12G the curved surface which
is shown in Fig. 127.
The
conditions would then be materially changed.
But this is precisely the
state of
things which
the revolving camera
represents, and which
j-our picture-plane would
represent
if you kept
turning it so as to have
it directly in front of you whichever way you were facing.
You Avill
see by the diagram that, as
rej^resented
in this cylindrical
j)icture, the
thickness of the piers
as they recede, instead of increasing as it does in Fig. 130, remains about the same as that of those nearest to
the observer, notwithstanding the fact that the more distant piers are seen cornerwise while the nearest ones
present hardly more than the width of one face to the observer.
And you must
also
see, that in a picture,
every imrt of tvldch was at the same distance from tlie observer''s eye, the piers would appear
shorter as
tJie
piers themselves werefarther aivay.
So that, if the observer were to draw on the cylindrical screen shown in
Fig. 127, and then flatten it out, the result would be like that in Fig. 128.
But pictures are not usually made on the inside of cylinders, to be unrolled afterward.
If they are made
on this kind of a surface, as "panoramas" or " cycloramas " are, they are intended
to
be
seen
in
just
that
position, and big
circular
houses
are
built for
their
special accommodation—built, too, in such
a way that
the observer cannot get very
far away from
the
station-point and must,
pei-force,
see the picture under
just the conditions which governed the j^erspective calculations on which the representation was based.
Fig. 128 shows that
if we could unroll one of these cylindrical
pictures we should
find
that the
repre-
sentations of all straight lines, except the vertical ones, were
really drawn
as
curves, so that the panorama is
said to be drawn in curvilinear perspective;
butA\'hen seen as they are intended to be seen, they look straight,
as they certainly would not do if they had been drawn
straight on a
flat surface which had been rolled into
the form of a cylinder afterward.

96
ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIVE.
Now, on the face of it, the attempt to make
flat pictures as if they were cylinders unrolled seems just as
absurd
as it would be to try to make cylindrical pictures out of
flat ones rolled up.*
There is more
to the
question than this, however, as we shall see.
Fig.
128.
Any picture—no matter whether it is drawn on a flat surface or on the
inside
of a cylinder—can appear
quite right only when the observer's eye—and 07ie eye, at that, remember—is at the station-jioint.
* The reader who cares to investigate the mathematics of curvilinear perspective as applied to the construction of cycloramas will find the
subject explained and illustrated with admirable fulness in Professor Ware's Modern Perspective.

CYLINDRICAL OH
CURl^ILINEAR
PERSPECTIl^E.
97
If you have a cyclorama
to
exhibit, you cau build a
little
enclosure for the
spectator jusc where he
should
be, in
the middle of the building, and keep him there
; and in exhibiting single pictures of consider-
able importance very much the same thing is often done, but in the vast majority of cases the
artist cannot
count upon anything of the kind.
If he
could,
it would
be
a very much simpler matter to make pictures
than it
is.
Remember, however, that, if drawn according to the principles of perspective which have been considered
in the preceding chapters and under conditions which your window-screen illustrates, the picture will always
be correct as long as it
is seen from the station -point.
The eye placed there may wander over the picture
as
restlessly as it does over the natural scene, and everything represented falls into
its place in the one case just
as it does in the other;
the long
lines
in Fig. 124 foreshorten themselves, and the road and the fence in the
foreground taper away to the right and left in the picture just as they do in nature.
In fact, the picture can-
not help being deceptively right (so far as its drawing is concerned) as long as the eye is where the draughts-
man counted on having it when he made the picture.
Even the question about a good part of the picture being out of focus, which has often been discussed,
is
one which takes care of
itself entirely.
One part of the picture is just as much out of focus when the eye is
occupied somewhei'e else as the corresponding part of the natural scene would be.
There is not a particle of
difference between the two cases.
The draughtsman has to think of something else besides getting
his picture in true perspective, because
he knows
it will be looked
at from every other point
of view as well as from the one intended.
Indeed,
the chances are, that not one person
in a thousand Avho ever
sees
it will get himself into the exact position
for which
its perspective
is calculated.
A few inches backward
or forward, even, will change
the whole
effect, as everybody knows who has tried to draw on the window-screen.
Most of us have probably criticised often enough the perspective of the scenery at the theatre, not re-
membering, or not knowing, that it would have been a perfectly easy matter for the painter to make the effect
deceptively right for some one-eyed man at the back of the house—in the gallery, perhaps—at the expense of

98
FSSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIVE.
everybody else in the audience, to each of whom the effect would have been simply ridiculous.
He cannot do
this, and
so he introduces a.good many modifications which he knows perfectly well to be errors or liberties,
for the sake of distributing these inevitable distortions more equitably.
In making small pictures the draughts-
man need not trouble himself much about this
; but in large ones it l)ecomes a question of very great moment,
and the difficulty has to be solved by drawing all detached objects of any importance as if they formed sepa-
rate pictures by themselves, which the
artist introduces into and reconciles with
his composition as a whole
the best way he can.
All
figures of men
and
of animals have to be treated
in
this way
;
and, indeed, nearly all
objects not
actually connected with other parts of
the picture by straight
lines may be, and usually are, drawn
in
this
way, to the manifest advantage of the whole effect.
Fig. 129, Avhich is traced from
a ]ihotograph of Titian's "Presentation of the Virgin,"
illustrates
this
well enough.
The buildings are drawn in "parallel"
perspective,
just
as you would draw your neighbor's
house across the way on your window-screen, Init the di-awing of the figures is a different matter altogether.
•
The following diagi-am. Figs. 130 and 131, shows the kind of
effect which ^vould have been obtained if
the
proportions of
the
figures had been determined by applying the
principles of plane
perspective.
It
simplifies matters to make use of one
figure
only, determining what
its appearance would be
in
different
parts of the
picture, rather than
to compare
it with another
figui'e
;
and, in order that we may determine
with considerable precision what
its appearance would
be under
different
conditions, this simple
architect-
ural feature, an arcade, is introduced to measure its proportions by.
There
is
just such an arcade at the left-hand side of Titian's picture, as you see.
I have supjjosed a
case
in which it should run straight across the whole canvas, the piers being about as thick as these people
in
the
picture seem to be.
Then, by changing the pillars into persons the monstrosity of figures drawn according to
this principle is demonstrated.
The architecture does not look so very bad, even in the case of the pier that is farthest to the right
;
l)ut
whether it does or not there seems to be little help for
it, and the master has, as you see, unhesitatingly drawn

his
Imildiiigs iu just tliis way.
But suppose this same pilLar transformed
into a man, as at C (Fig. 131), the
figure l)eiiig in the picture about as he is at A, and you see at once that that would not do at alh
The result of trying to apply this kind of perspective to such pictures as this has sometimes led teachers
to refer the drawing of
the figures to the principles of cylindrical or curvilinear perspective.
A
little study
of the diagrams, however, will show that this only helps us out of one difficulty to get us into another.
Fig.
i2g.
The arcade in Fig. 132
is drawn in cylindrical perspective, but the figures into which
its piers are trans-
formed (Fig. 133) are not much nearer the mark than
those in Fig. 131.
They do not broaden out
as they
recede,
it
is
true, but they turn their backs on us (or their faces), as it was never intended that they should
do
;
and, what
is
a far more
serious matter, they grow smaller and smaller
as they approach the frame, as
they certainly do not in the original picture.

ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIl^E.
The fact of the matter is, then, tbat the figures in this jDicture of Titian's are not drawn in true perspec-
tive, either plane or cylindrical, as calculated for a fixed station-point.
The buildings are, but the
figures are
not.
These last are drawn, not as they would look when the observer turned
his head to look at them, turn-
ing
his picture at the same time, but as they would look when he moved alo7ig so as to he opposite to each in
his turn.
This construction, as applied to the arcade, is shown
in Fig. 134, where just
as many station-points have
been used as there were arches to be drawn.
\t
is introduced in this place only for the sake of its applica-
tion to the human
figure
; but where simulated architecture, indefinitely extended,
is employed, as
it often
is
in decoration—on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, for example—the same practice has to be resorted to.
Pictures made
in
this way (and
all
large figure-pieces are
so
constructed) are records, then, of
a suc-
cession of
impressions obtained from a station-point which moves along
horizontally before the picture and
in
a
line that
is parallel
witli
it,
as the visitor
to a gallery moves along the
rail which keeps Lim from
going
too near the
pictures, and
not from
a
station-point which
revolves, as the
visitoi'
to the cyclorama
has to do.
I have said that large pictures are always made in this way, but
it would have been more correct to say
that they are usually so constructed.
One is
quite at
liberty to draw
his picture as
if
it were a cylinder uni'olled
if
he chooses to do so, and
that method has occasionally been adopted.
It must be admitted, also, that the effect is admirable with
cer-
tain kinds of subjects—extended landscapes, for instance, in which the principal forms
are all at a considera-
ble distance.
A good many of Turner's landscapes are drawn in this way, and there used to be a small picture of AU-
ston's in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts to which the same method had been applied.
Both of these masters, moreover, applied the principles of
curvilinear perspective
to the straight lines of
the architecture as well
as to detached
objects, which, of course, made the
effect very much like that in Fig.

; but
this is by no means usual, and in Allston's case, at
least, it
is hardly to be regarded
in any other
light than that of an experiment.
What
artists usually do
is what Titian has done
in the
case we have just been regarding,
viz.
:
To
draw the
architectural
part
of
their
sul)jects
in true
jierspective
as applied
to a plane
like our window-
screen, and then
to add
the detached
objects, such as figures, as
if
the observer were standing in front
of
each in his tuin.
All columns and capitals, and a good many other details of buildings, are sufficiently detachable and have
enough interest as separate objects to be treated in this way too, and it is customary so to treat them.
Straight
lines, like
those
in
pavements, walls, lintels, and
roofs, have to be left
as
originally drawn
in
plane perspective, as they could not otherwise be made to agree with the spectator's idea of what level things
ought
to be, as derived from the
lines of the room
in which the picture was hung, and even from
its own
frame.
And, generally speaking, the connection of
all square-cornered members with the long lines of the pict-
ure
is
so
close
that the
rule given above has to
be
observed
;
thus,
a
square
post will usually be drawn
as
at A, Fig.
136, no matter how awkward the
effect may be
to
an
observer who
does not occupy the
station-point.
But the circular one which might be made
out
of
it
would
not, in
the same
position, be
drawn as at B, which
a
strict regard
for perspective would demand, but
as
at D
instead,
just
as
if
the
square
stick from which
it might
have been made had been drawn as it is either at C or
at E.
As
its
lines
are curves, there is no difficulty in reconciling them with the
straight
lines around them.
Even the observer
at the
station-point does not notice that the posts are
too small, and
to everybody else they look a great
deal better than they would have done if they had been drawn in true persj^ective.
As has just been
said, this treatment has sometimes been extended
to
the long
straight
lines of the
picture too, very notably 1)y Turner
; and
the result, -where the architectural
lines do not come
too near the
foreground, is
certainly very delightful.
The charm of
it
is
to be ascribed partly to the picturesqueness of
arrangement
into which every detail
of the
picture
necessarily falls Avhen
treated
in
this way, but
partly,

CYLINDRICAL OR CURFILINEAR PERSPECTIVE.
105
A
also, to tlie
.association which a reflective observer discovers between the impression which the picture makes
and that which he derives from nature.
Fig. 137, Turner's picture of the "Bridge
at Coblentz," which
is taken from Ruskin's "Elements
of
Drawing,"
is a first-rate example of this painter's application of the principles under discussion.
The eye wanders over such a picture
as
it does over nature, and
finds everywhere the same retreating
and converging lines, giving an idea of vastness
which is not to be obtained in any other way.
Mr. Ruskin has felt the charm of the pict-
ure, and has written very beautifully about
it,
but, curiously enough, he has
entirely failed
to
discover the
real motive for the peculiarity of
treatment which renders it interesting.
He has a
great deal to say about the currents of rivers and
the
desirableness of not building bridges
level,
but the fact that the whole matter is purely one
of persj)ective efPect has somehow eluded him.
A glance
at the drawing, however, and
a
comparison of it with Fig. 125, .will convince anybody that
the curvature of the bridge
is to be accounted for
on this ground, and on no other.
Mr. Ruskin's theory, that bridges ought to have the highest arches where the water is deepest, may be a
very good one, and Turner may have felt the same way about them, for aught we know.
But there is nothing
in the drawing
befoi-e us to show that he had any opinion about
it one way or the
other.
At any rate, the
drawing of this bridge is not to be accounted for on any such grounds.
The curvature is exaggerated,
it is true, for an observer would have
to
stand nearer to the bridge than
the
rest
of
the
picture
indicates, to obtain
as much of a curve as this in running his eye along it; but
the
Fig.

ESSENTIALS OF PERSPECTIVE.
exaggeration
is not
a very great
matter, after all, and
the facts of nature have probably sufEered quite
as
serious misrepresentation in the same picture in many things for which no good Turnerian would ever think
of requiring an explanation.
And the fact is not to be denied, that in nature the curve is there.
You can
see it every time you run
your eye along the roofs across the street, if you can only disabuse your mind of
its preconceived notion that
Fig.
137-
the roofs are level.
Indeed, you can hardly see anything else in the lines of the sky, whose dome-like character
is purely a matter of perspective effect, the actual curvature that exists in the
stratification of
all the clouds
to be seen from any point on the suface of the
earth being perfectly insignificant; and we perceive
it, partly
because the lines are so very long, but partly, also, because we do not have the flatness of the cloud-beds im-
pressed upon us every moment of our lives, as we do the straightness of the edges of the buildings.
Asa means of
assisting the artist to reproduce the impressions ^vhich
are made by nature, this modifica-

CYLINDRICAL OR CURVILINEAR PERSPECTIFE.
107
tion of
details
in accordance with the jii'lnciples
of
cylindrical perspective
is constantly resorted
to, uncon-
sciously,
it may be, but none the less certainly.
Anyone painting an extended view out of doors represents distant objects, not as they would appear if
projected upon a flat screen, but as if they were drawn on the inside of a cylinder, as Turner drew this bridge.
Whether it
is, in general, desirable to carry the modification as far as Turner has done, in this and many
other cases,
it is not the purpose of this little book to discuss.
It is a poetic license, no doubt, liut what would poetry be without its licenses ?
And what sacrilege it is
to attempt to try such delightful productions as this by the standards of our dull prose
!
It is to be distinctly understood, however, that the prose
consists in limiting the painter who works on
flat surfaces to the principles of plane perspective, not to the application of science, in its larger aspects, to his
work.
Turner's work is just as scientific as it is poetic, and furnishes as good an illustration as anyone could
want of the truth on which teachers like to dwell—that scientific habits of thinking, and the power that comes
with them, have no quarrel wdth the imagination, and ofEer no obstacle, but only helps, to its boldest flights.
