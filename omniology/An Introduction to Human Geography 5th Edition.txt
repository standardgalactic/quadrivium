owe them all a debt of gratitude for seeing this project 
through to completion. Thanks are also due to Peter 
Jones, Department of History, University of Birming-
ham, for advice concerning Section 1 of the book.
Those who have used earlier editions will note that 
this one includes a new editor. For the fifth edition a new 
(fifth) member of the editorial team (Tim Hall) brings 
fresh ideas, energy and insight. The old hands are very 
pleased that Tim so readily agreed to join us! For all of 
the editors, production of the fifth edition has taken 
place at a time when we have all been facing numerous 
challenges and demands on our time, whether as a result 
of moving to pastures new, family commitments, mak-
ing the transition to formal retirement, or simply coping 
with the ever-changing landscape of higher education. 
However, we have continued to work closely together as 
a team. Sticking to the task has again been made easier 
by the continuing enthusiasm shown by all the contribu-
tors and the team at Pearson; this has ensured that we 
have produced a fifth edition that we can all be proud of.
The School of Geography, Earth and Environmental 
Sciences at the University of Birmingham kindly offered 
us temporary office space, where sections of this edition 
could be assembled during the spring and early summer 
of 2015 and where an early draft of the Introduction was 
first hammered out by James and Tim. We are all grate-
ful for this and James also thanks them for the wider 
hospitality during his sabbatical visit to Birmingham in 
2015. James would also like to thank colleagues and stu-
dents at the University of Amsterdam and National Uni-
versity of Singapore, where many of the ideas in Section 
5 were rehearsed.
As with all the past editions, the most important moti-
vation, of course, is our hope that the ideas, perspectives 
and challenges discussed in this book will encourage 
readers to connect with human geography; after all, the 
vitality of the discipline depends on students being en-
thused and critically, as well as creatively, engaging with 
human geography within and beyond the classroom.

As ever, the on-going success of this project relies on the 
goodwill and enthusiasm of the contributors. We would 
also like to thank the panel of reviewers who assessed 
the fourth edition and made suggestions on the ways 
in which it might be improved. This edition therefore 
includes some new chapters that reflect the feedback 
from the panel and which continues to ensure a lively 
collection of contributions: from those who have con-
tributed from the outset, from those who joined as new 
contributors to the second, third or fourth editions, and 
from those who are new to the fifth edition. All have 
enthusiastically responded to the editors’ edict that they 
should seek to adopt an accessible writing style that will 
engage readers and encourage them to make connections 
between many of the issues discussed in the book and 
their day-to-day experiences. This is achieved by using 
contemporary/everyday examples that makes the mate-
rial more meaningful and less abstract. The importance 
of developing global perspectives is retained while also 
encouraging the contributors to include as wide a range 
of examples as possible, especially from Europe. We 
have again sought to ensure good integration between 
the case studies/artwork and the text so that the reader 
can see why a particular feature is situated at a particu-
lar point in a chapter, what it is there to illustrate, how 
it can provoke readers to think through the issue, and 
how it relates to the main narrative. It has also been very 
important to ensure that the fifth edition continues to 
offer readers perspectives on recent debates, issues and 
controversies that were a feature of the earlier editions. 
The contributors have risen to all these challenges and we 
would like to acknowledge their constructive response 
to the dialogue that this has necessitated along the way.
The editors and contributors are indebted to Patrick 
Bond (then at Pearson) who initiated the discussions 
that led to the decision to prepare a fifth edition. Just as 
the process was getting underway he handed over to Lina 
Aboujieb, who then offered invaluable support and en-
couragement during the process of pulling together the 
final manuscript and liaised with the contributors over 
contracts and queries associated with the artwork and 
illustrations. There are other members of the editorial 
and production staff at Pearson that the Editors do not 
meet, such as those tasked with preparing the artwork 
or undertaking the copy-editing and proofreading; we

Geography: finding your  
way in the world
Introduction
Geography is indispensable to survival. All animals, including 
­American students who consistently fail their geography tests,  
must be competent applied geographers. How else do they get 
around, find food and mate, avoid dangerous places?
(Yi-Fu Tuan 2002: 123)
We believe that our everyday lives are simply teeming with the kinds 
of issues and questions that are often pigeon-holed as theory. Much 
of the excitement and value in Human Geography lies in addressing 
these issues and questions by thinking through aspects of our own 
lives and of the world(s) in which we live.
(Cloke et al. 2014: 2)

2    INTRODUCTION
T
his book is the fifth edition of An Introduction to 
Human Geography. The first edition was published 
in 2001. The task of compiling the first edition there-
fore dates back to 1997–98 so that it is now approach-
ing 20 years since we wrote the first introduction. 
While the fifth edition incorporates further changes to 
the structure and contents and one new editor, we have 
retained the original goal, which was to provide an 
introduction to human geography that focuses upon 
contemporary issues and approaches. What introduc-
tory textbooks in human geography choose to include 
and foreground (and what is excluded or neglected) 
some years ago became the subject of heated debate 
in a leading disciplinary journal (Transactions of  the 
Institute of  British Geographers). According to one 
of the protagonists, textbooks (in part via their influ-
ence on a prospective new generation of geographers) 
become part of what shapes the dominant themes for 
research and scholarship in a discipline. Textbooks are 
thereby implicated ‘in strategies to mobilize support 
for a particular set of disciplinary practices’ (Johnston 
2007: 437).
Textbooks also reflect where they are written and 
where they are read. For example, most textbooks written 
in North America devote a significant number of words 
to explaining what geography is and what constitutes 
a geographical approach. Early on in one of the most 
widely used American human geography introductions, 
Marston et al. (2011: 2) noted that:
The power of geography comes from its integrative 
approach, which addresses global connections, his-
torical trends, and systemic political-economic and 
socio-cultural relations by drawing on the intellectual 
tradition in both the natural and social sciences.
The reason why introductory textbooks in the United 
States need to explicitly consider definitions of human 
geography and devote space to explaining what a geo-
graphical approach amounts to is that many of the stu-
dents taking a module in introductory human geography 
are not geography majors; that is, they will not go on 
to specialize in geography, and they will usually have 
experienced limited or no exposure to it as a discipline at 
high school. Geography is seldom taught in the Ameri-
can ‘K–12’ (kindergarten to pre-university) school sys-
tem. The institutional setting within which the present 
textbook has been put together is different. The editors 
and most of the contributors are currently attached to 
(or associated with) British or continental European uni-
versities, or in countries where the influence of a British 
style educational system is more evident. Many of their 
students have chosen to specialize in geography at a sec-
ondary school or college and have made a choice to read 
for a degree in geography. Consequently, students from 
these countries often have ideas about the subject mat-
ter of the discipline (although this may turn out to be 
rather different from much of what they will subsequently 
encounter at university: see Bonnett 2003 and Stannard 
2003). Further, the departmental contexts within which 
geography is taught and learnt within universities varies a 
great deal between different institutions and national sys-
tems of higher education. The fact that the discipline is 
being reproduced across a variegated international insti-
tutional landscape may be having an impact on geogra-
phy’s immediate futures (see Spotlight box I.1).
Moreover, human geography and the world that it seeks 
to interpret and represent are dynamic. In the years since 
we embarked on the first edition of this book a great deal 
has changed in the world; ongoing processes of migration, 
urbanization and economic transformations (such as the 
fast pace of development in parts of China, the Persian 
Gulf and India) are producing new spaces, connections 
and flows that require new maps and geographical narra-
tives. New divisions are also being created, old conflicts 
revived and, on first appearances, the world might appear 
to be more fragmented and contested than it was at the 
start of the twentieth century. For example, the aftermath 
of the 2008 global financial crisis, which is still being felt in 
many economies across the world, seems to have acceler-
ated the shift in the centre of geo-economic power further 
towards parts of Asia; although such shifts are uneven and 
there are some countervailing trends.
Spotlight box I.1
Departments and the reproduction of 
geography: where do you fit?
University geography departments are very diverse enti-
ties. As Noel Castree (2011, 5) has noted, ‘A century ago, 
a small number of university geographers in England and 
elsewhere worked hard to create a subject that is, today, 
far larger and more buoyant than they could possibly have 
imagined’. The scale and complexity of geography as an 
academic discipline is apparent in a number of ways, one 
of which is the complexity of its management arrange-
ments, the ways in which it is organised into departments 

INTRODUCTION    3
in universities. Some geography departments are single 
subject, autonomous units but increasingly, in the UK at 
least, and for much longer in other countries, geography 
is managed alongside other subjects such as archaeol-
ogy, sociology, environmental science, geology and a host 
of others from across the sciences, social sciences, arts 
and humanities. One of the editors, along with a number 
of other colleagues mapped the changing management 
of geography within UK higher education, interpreting 
these trends within the wider political economies of UK 
and international higher education systems (Hall et al. 
2015). And all five editors were once either postgradu-
ate students or staff at what was in the 1990s (when the 
first edition of this textbook was planned) a single subject 
geography department (founded in 1924, although the 
subject was taught from the 1890s in Mason College, 
which became the University of Birmingham in 1900), 
but is now a larger School of Geography, Earth and Envi-
ronmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham.
These different departmental configurations and 
management arrangements reflect a number of things 
including traditions of academic management, national 
systems of higher education, fluctuations in student num-
bers, financial and administrative pressures as well as 
disciplinary and intellectual fashions, trends and aspira-
tions. For example, in most North American universities 
geography courses are required to meet the needs of 
non-geography students who are taking geography as an 
option or elective. Single subject, autonomous geography 
departments are therefore the exception rather than the 
rule, and in many continental European countries, physi-
cal and human geography are separate departments.
Think about the university department at which you 
are studying geography. Understanding the administrative 
place of academic geography can tell you a lot about the 
institutional pressures that it has to confront, its security, 
the wider structures that the discipline is located within 
and the possibilities for its immediate futures. Reflect 
upon the place of geography within your university and 
what this reveals. For example, is geography the only sub-
ject in your department or is it managed alongside other 
subjects? If it is the latter, what are the other subjects in 
your department? Does it differ from the management of 
geography in other universities? Most importantly, though, 
does this management of geography in your university 
matter? Does it impact upon the geography you study? 
For example, are you able to take courses taught with 
students from other subjects, perhaps that are taught by 
non-geography staff? How does this affect your emerg-
ing geographical imagination (see page 6)? Does your 
exposure to perspectives from beyond geography enrich 
or diminish your own geographies? If you are in a sin-
gle subject autonomous geography department look at 
the publications produced by your lecturers (usually their 
homepages indicate some of these, but they can also be 
searched on Google Scholar and the like). Do they con-
duct research and publish with non-geographers? Who 
are these collaborators, why have these collaborations 
arisen and what sort of geographies are being produced 
through them? Very quickly you will discover that geogra-
phy is not a hermetically sealed discipline but it overlaps 
with other fields in many ways and for many reasons.
Think also about the history of geography in your 
university. Can you find out if the management of geog-
raphy has changed over time? This information is not 
always readily available – but it may be worth looking 
into. Asking your lecturers may be a starting point or 
finding out if there is a published history of your depart-
ment (such as the one for Birmingham by Giles, 1987). 
The issue of why has it changed and who got to decide 
geography's institutional position is often complex, how-
ever. Was this the result of decisions made by geography 
staff or university managers, most of whom were prob-
ably not geographers by background? You will find that 
geography is not just an intellectual pursuit that exists in 
a vacuum but is impacted by its immediate disciplinary, 
institutional and wider socio-economic contexts. The 
geography you will learn and the geographer you will 
become will also be a product of these and the many 
other contexts within which geography is reproduced 
here and around the world. You can start to understand 
and unpack the reproduction of geography by turning 
your critical eye on your own geography department and 
the geographies it is producing.
Changing worlds: changing human geographies
Geographical knowledge is not – and should not attempt to be – 
static and detached from what is going on in the world, but is rather 
dynamic and profoundly influenced by events, struggles and politics 
beyond ­university life.
(Blunt and Wills 2000: x–xi)
The root of the word ‘geography’ combines geo (earth) and 
graphy (writing). To engage in geography is to write about 
the earth (which includes its lands and seas, resources, 
places and peoples) or, more widely perhaps, to represent 
the earth in text (which includes maps: some of the most 
complexly crafted of all texts). Of course, many other 
branches of knowledge such as history, anthropology,

terms italicized in the last sentence have been enduring top-
ics in human geography. However, approaches too them 
have shifted radically over the decades. Moreover, human 
geography is not just about ‘out there’, it is also about ‘in 
here’ (see Spotlight box I.2). Thus, you all create your own 
personal geographies derived, for example, from where you 
live, where you work or when you travel.
sociology, oceanography, politics and geology (from which 
geography draws) and many other sciences are also in some 
way or other about the world. Traditionally, what has been 
distinctive about human geography is that it puts an empha-
sis on people in places and spaces, on landscapes modified 
by human interventions, human relationships with nature 
and environment and on complex spatial connections. The

Geography is everywhere
By Clare Madge
Willow fell and swallow soar
In my back garden
there were two
beautiful
wispy
emerald
willow
trees.
where pigeons roosted
and swallows soared.
One day
Two men
Climbed
The trees
And
Felled
Them
Whole.
In life there are many things
that can bring us to our
knees,
fell us sure as any tree.
But, like the willow stump,
we can grow shoots
and again start sprouting
to journey with swallows.
Geography is everywhere. The poem might not 
immediately appear to be ‘geography as you know it’. 
I wrote the poem as I was sitting in my garden recover-
ing from chemotherapy. In the poem I was meditating 
about my cancer diagnosis and my will to survive. At 
that moment I felt a resonance with the felled tree, its 
life being truncated and its future unknown, although I 
also drew strength from the tree, knowing it would grow 
back through its ‘irrepressible vitality’. So, if geography 
is everywhere, how is this poem geographical? What 
can it tell us about geographical worlds and how those 
worlds might be expressed?
Geography is everywhere, emerging out of our lived 
lives. As the poem shows, these lived lives are not simply 
about our human world but are infused with animals, 
plants and atmospheres. Moreover, these geographical 
worlds may at the same time be about death, dying and 
vulnerability as well as life, living and vitality: spaces of 
dissolution and fragility circulate beside spaces of regen-
eration, challenging simplistic oppositions of life/death. 
The poem also reveals that therapeutic landscapes exist 
far beyond medicalised places (hospital wards), and that 
these landscapes can be metaphorical and ­spiritual. 
Those experiencing life-threatening illnesses can cre-
ate a vision of the world – an active place-making – 
that helps them sculpt out a way of being in the world 
that makes a life worth living. So although perhaps not 
instantly apparent, this poem touches upon those well-
versed geographical themes of place, space, landscape 
and nature. But it is about more than that too.
Geography is everywhere and geographical worlds 
can be emotional, sentient and visceral. They can be 
about minded-bodies that feel. The poem is deliberately 
and unashamedly intimate and it paints a picture from 
‘the inside’, from a one minded-body going through a 
particular experience of a cancer diagnosis. Such inti-
mate expression can be used to counter disembodied 
accounts, disclosing detailed knowledge and candid 
feelings – a sort of finely tuned life-writing – thus being 
a means to insert the ill minded-body into geographi-
cal publishing space, populating geographical texts with 
the diverse bodies that are still sometimes forced to its 
margins. Poetic encounters can act as a portal into such 
inner lifeworlds, bringing alive a fleshy, fine-grained emo-
tive analysis of everyday lived life, albeit from a specific 
framing or perspective.

and, until 2015, also published the daily Financial Times 
and the weekly Economist. The company found itself in 
the headlines in March 2011, when it was revealed that the 
holdings of the Libyan Investment Trust (LIT), who held 
3.2 per cent of Pearson’s shares, had been suspended, along 
with the freezing of other assets belonging to the then gov-
ernment of Libya (and the Qaddafi family who formed its 
core). This followed the outbreak of a civil war – in which 
Britain and other outside powers had taken military sides 
with the anti-Qaddafi rebels, who soon after overthrew the 
regime leading to protracted civil war. In turn, Pearson’s 
stake in the LIT reflects the flows of money associated 
with geographies of resources (oil and gas) and the mod-
ern financial system that are considered in later chapters. 
But, in turn, Libyan economic and political geographies 
cannot be understood without reference to colonial histo-
ries (the then Ottoman Turkish lands that today comprise 
Libya were invaded by Italy in 1911, in a bloody war that 
cost thousands of Arab lives), nationalism, revolution and 
geopolitics. It can be argued that these led the post-colonial 
Libyan state (established in the early 1950s in the debris of 
Italian fascist imperialism and the Second World War) into 
violent conflict with the West, with some of its neighbours 
(whose boundaries themselves were drawn by competing 
European colonialists) as well as with more conservative 
Arab regimes. Such colonial histories continue to be con-
tested elsewhere in the Middle East, with ongoing conse-
quences for Libya and the wider world.
Through such myriad social–cultural, political and 
economic geographies, we inhabit a world, as John Pick-
les (2004: 5) pointed out:
that has, in large part, been made as a geo-coded 
world; a world where boundary objects have been 
inscribed, literally written on the surface of the earth 
and coded by layer upon layer of lines drawn on paper.
Those geo-codes have increasingly become digital. 
They are stored, transformed, transmitted and negotiated 
electronically; as in the signal that your mobile phone 
is transmitting regarding your current location (unless 
you have turned it off) or the data about you that is in 
archives, online or within that phone (be it on or off).
Such complexity, connections and challenges (as well as 
diverse ‘geo-codes’) are evident when we consider the idea 
of ‘globalization’. As many of the chapters spell out, a com-
bination of technical, political, ideological, cultural and 
economic transformations throughout the twentieth cen-
tury enhanced the sense of global interconnection. Take the 
case of this book. The copy that you are reading may well 
have been printed far from where you picked it up. Or you 
may be reading it as an e-book. Either way, it was published 
by a multinational company, whose ownership and ‘home’ 
location may not be immediately evident. The shares of the 
publisher (Pearson) are traded in London, part of the daily 
turnover on the world’s largest stock exchange. In addition 
to textbooks such as this, Pearson publishes  Penguin books 
So  .  .  .  geography is everywhere, and it can be 
expressed in a multitude of ways. While the vast majority 
of geographic texts are written in conventional academic 
style, there are also alternative ways of expressing geog-
raphy. Examples include creative writing, theatre, photog-
raphy, painting, films, music and poetry. Thus geography 
is a subject that can be expressed in multifaceted, multi-
sensory creative formats (Madge 2014a, 2014b).
However, while geography is everywhere, it is every­
where differently. This poem is written from the frame 
of someone experiencing one specific illness, located 
in a precise place, with its particular system of health 
care, embedded in specific social and political networks 
and experienced through a distinct minded-body. Cancer 
is, however, a prevalent worldwide disease. As a health 
issue of (differential) global significance, it is therefore 
a topic of important consideration, but the experience 
of cancer varies enormously across the globe. Poetic 
expression can carve out space for ‘other’ stories about 
cancer from ‘other’ places, illustrating the intense social 
and spatial inequalities in health outcomes and experi-
ences. As poetry is also emotive and embodied, it has 
the potential to ‘show’ another person how it is to feel or 
experience something beyond their specific world per-
spective, enabling appreciation that the world is made 
up of manifold, heterogeneous geographies, which are 
constantly changing.
Thus, geography is everywhere and is continu-
ally emerging: it is a living subject. The poem was a 
response to my changed life circumstances, but it was 
also a reflection on living on and shaping a world in 
which I was part. It is on this point that I wish to finish. 
Geography is a living subject and in its liveliness we 
all have potential to shape the world in which we live. 
Geography is not simply a static, flat canvas which we 
describe and interpret as scholars, but we can shape the 
contours and terrain of that geographical landscape too. 
It is exciting to think about all those diverse geographies 
not yet expressed, waiting to emerge out of your (multi-
ple) experiences, voices and visions.

force, breaking down barriers, making capitalism more 
efficient and spreading its benefits throughout the world. 
For others it is a more negative process enabling another 
round of exploitation, often with the further destruction 
of local cultures and identities and further commodify-
ing life and nature. Everything is for sale, everything has 
a price. Obviously, globalization has been contested, in 
terms of both the meanings attributed to it and the evalu-
ation of its consequences. Judge for yourself, but as you 
do so, do not make the mistake of assuming that everyone 
everywhere shares your vantage point and experiences of 
the world. And having boomed as a term and way of talk-
ing about the world in the 1990s, recent years have seen 
use of the term begin to decline. Although based on a 
selective sample of books published in English since 1900, 
data provided by Google’s scanning of books indicates 
that the number using the term ‘globalization’ peaked in 
the mid-2000s after a steep rise from almost zero in the 
1980s (see Figure 1).
Some events and moments have had global coverage as 
an iconic image likened by some to the moment when the 
American Apollo 8 spacecraft in 1968 captured the first 
image of the earth as a whole from space, or the reception 
of photographs of the earth from space by subsequent 
NASA missions (see Plate 1). These images have since 
circulated widely and are credited with reshaping human 
perceptions of the planet (see Cosgrove 2001). Yet the way 
that some events become ‘significant’ or ‘global’ reflects 
where they happen and who they affect. The spectacu-
lar losses of thousands of lives in Manhattan on ‘9/11’, 
for example, became a global media event and subject of 
debate in the way that the death of several million peo-
ple through a decade of war from the mid-1990s in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo never did.
To describe contemporary technological, economic, 
cultural or political tendencies as ‘globalization’ is to 
invoke a certain geographical imagination: a vision of 
the growing significance of a global scale of action, of 
the world as a single place. Yet, we know that many 
people and places remain relatively marginalized, sense 
dangers or face threats from these supposedly hypermo-
bile ways of living and working. And some people and 
places benefit from them more than others. Of course, 
such power and inequality are not themselves new. Con-
sider the profits and consequences of the transatlantic 
slave trade between the sixteenth and nineteenth centu-
ries, for example (see Chapter 2). Cheap sugar and cot-
ton for northern hemisphere markets and manufacturers 
in Europe and America enabled new links, markets and 
economies. But the humans traded as unpaid workers 
(slaves) and objects of exploitation who did the work did 
not see it that way (if they lived long at all). Today, a low-
paid worker (or self-employed prospector) in a diamond 
mine might experience the global trade in these miner-
als rather differently to the companies that dominate the 
jewellery business. Certainly the benefits of globalization 
are uneven. This is not new.
As an alternative to the term ‘globalization’, we might 
use other terms: ‘imperialism’, ‘power’ or ‘capitalism’, 
for example. Each carries particular connotations. In this 
way, ‘globalization’ serves as a particular concept that is 
used to make sense of the world whereby a certain geo-
graphical imagination, of an increasingly connected and 
‘shrinking’ world for example, is emphasized. Yet just 
because something is imagined and interpreted in par-
ticular ways and by reference to particular geographies, 
it does not make it any less real to those caught up in 
it. Globalization is seen by some as a broadly positive

separate degree schemes. This happened as the old cur-
riculum – based on classical learning in philosophy and 
sciences – began to break down with the rise of science, 
commerce and new capitalist rationalities. The fact that 
the late nineteenth century was also a time when many 
European states (chief amongst them Britain, France and 
the Netherlands) were engaged in overseas colonization 
and empire-building, and all were keen to foster their 
sense of national identity and territorial coherence, gave 
geography a new practical relevance. Children needed to 
be taught, it was argued, about their nation and its place 
in the world and their teachers thus required a degree 
in geography. At the same time, geographical knowledge 
had direct strategic and military relevance (this was the 
moment too of the birth of geopolitics, as detailed in 
Chapter 20) as well as commercial and imperial relevance, 
such as in schemes to exploit the perceived agricultural 
potential of colonies in Africa and Asia, for example. 
Nineteenth-century ideas about the relations between 
climate, environment and ‘race’, and (to use the language 
of that time) ‘civilization’ and progress, were caught up 
with the emergence of the discipline, but so too were the 
impacts of Darwin’s ideas about evolution (which influ-
enced physical geography too: in the conception of the 
way that landforms evolve).
The early years of the modern discipline were there-
fore inescapably tied up with nationalism and empires. 
This continued into the early twentieth century, with a 
growing number of geography departments being estab-
lished at universities in the USA and Canada, in many 
Latin American countries, in the European colonies and 
dependencies and in Japan. In some instances, such as 
Russia, the earliest departments were organized in the 
1880s and this was tied to nation-building rather than 
overseas expansion. Such was also the case in Germany 
and in Scandinavia. By the time of the Second World 
War, geography was relatively well established – and the 
practical knowledge (as part of military ‘intelligence’, for 
example) it yielded in wartime helped to consolidate the 
discipline’s place in universities in many countries. After 
1945 new challenges arose as other disciplines expanded, 
but (with some exceptions such as the closure of a few 
departments in the United States), geography benefited 
from the first big post-war expansion in the number both 
of universities and of students in the 1960s. Human geog-
raphy increasingly reoriented itself to the technological 
and scientific spirit of the times, fed by a new phase of 
military competition in the Cold War (on this, see Barnes 
and Farish 2006).
In an age of formal decolonization, where the old impe-
rial disciplinary role was waning, human geography also 
found new fields of study and outlets for its graduates 
(such as conservation, development and planning: but also

A brief glance at the available disciplinary histories of geography

Consider how the contents and style of this text, like 
those others, is marked by where it was written. Geogra-
phy, as a subject, has both history and its own geography; 
it has varied in space and time. As a student of the sub-
ject, you might want to venture online, or into the recess 
of a library, to discover past textbooks, such as Haggett 
(1972) which over 40 years ago was a ground-breaking 
text. It is important to appreciate this – and the longer-
term – intellectual heritages of geography.
As a distinct subject (with students reading for a degree 
in it) geography has been present in European universi-
ties since the mid- to late-nineteenth century. Before then, 
however, geographical knowledge was studied and taught 
in many universities (not only those in Europe, but in the 
great centres of learning in the predominantly Islamic 
world, such as Baghdad and Cairo), as part of a variety of 
programmes of study – sometimes alongside mathemat-
ics and geometry for example, or as part of (or alongside) 
natural history, astronomy or cosmography (see Withers 
and Mayhew 2002). In the second half of the nineteenth 
century, universities were reorganized around modern 
disciplines, increasingly with discrete departments and

8    INTRODUCTION
Nearly 40 years later, another leading geographer 
claimed that:
it is worth affirming the importance of the geographi-
cal imagination, as a matter of both practical wisdom 
and scholarly reflection, and not least for its pleasure 
and enchantment, for people’s love of learning about 
the world and their place within it.
(Daniels 2011: 186)
Today though, the taken-for-granted ‘him’ of Har-
vey’s (1973) quote would be qualified with ‘him or 
her’: and with this perhaps a recognition of significant 
gender differences in experiences and assumptions. For 
example, where do men and women experience space 
differently and how does this relate to spaces of power, 
sexuality, work and reproduction? Such sensitivity has 
evolved out of the ways that by the 1970s geographers, 
David Harvey amongst them and later joined by others 
from many different backgrounds, started to ask more 
difficult questions about inequality, power, exploitation 
and difference. In turn, capitalism entered a phase of 
heightened restructuring (shaped by economic reces-
sions, new technologies and new forms and places of 
production and regulation, as detailed in Section 4). 
Reflecting the times, human geographers became more 
concerned with inequality, economic and political 
crises and contradictions. Feminist, humanistic, eco-
logical and other critiques also started to impact on 
human geography and feed into re-evaluations both of 
its history (the way that early twentieth-century impe-
rial geography was shaped by racism and sexism, for 
example) and contemporary contents. Moreover, the 
boundaries between many of human geography’s sub-
disciplines, such as urban, political, historical or cul-
tural geography, became more blurred. However, along 
the way, the modelling, data processing and visual-
izing capabilities of geographic information science 
continued to be refined (Fairbairn and Dorling 1997; 
Fotheringham et al. 2000; Schuurman 2004) and the 
Internet, digitisation and mobile technologies produced  
new capacities for communication and altered  
relations and perceptions of proximity and distance 
(see www.zooknic.com for work on the geographies 
of the Internet). For some, outside the discipline, the 
decline of the Cold War in the late 1980s brought the 
‘end of history’. For others, the development of tech-
nology and the globalization of the economy were cre-
ating a ‘borderless world’; some even proclaimed the 
‘end of geography’.
Yet the fact that social and economic processes take 
place across space matters. Indeed the way they do so is 
vital to how they operate. Human geography is not just 
about describing the spatial manifestations of economy 
many others, by virtues of the broader skills they would 
acquire within a geography degree). There were, however, 
fierce debates about the appropriate focus (for example 
over the status of regional geography) and methods (such 
as the role of statistical analysis), which meant that what 
undergraduate students were exposed to (and thus had 
to learn) to pass a geography degree continued to change 
(though unevenly, depending on where they studied).
By the 1960s and 1970s, the world was changing and so 
was human geography. At first it led geographers to adopt 
statistical techniques, seeking to render the discipline 
more scientific. But other, more radical social and politi-
cal changes (think of the hippies, the rise of feminism and 
gay liberation, or the movements against the American 
war in Vietnam and for civil rights in America and the 
wider spirit of revolution that came to the fore in the late 
1960s) kindled interest in the underlying economic causes 
of inequality, turmoil and conflict in capitalist societies. 
An early 1990s textbook, introducing the ensuing theo-
retical debates in human geography, noted how, by the 
1970s, ‘human geography as an academic discipline had 
just entered into a period of considerable turmoil’ (Cloke 
et al. 1991: viii). They go on to note how:
One of the most obvious characteristics of contem-
porary human geography is its diversity of approach. 
Within human geography today there is an unprec-
edented liveliness to the engagement with issues of 
method and theory. Rarely, if ever before, has the sub-
ject seen such a plurality of research methodologies 
and encompassed such a broad sweep of topics of 
investigation.
(Cloke et al. 1991: 1)
This liveliness has continued, reflecting both changes 
in the world (including political, economic and cultural 
shifts) and accompanying technical developments, theo-
retical exuberance and shifting funding arrangements 
for, and ways of, running universities. Cloke et al. (1991) 
looked back to what one particularly creative geographer 
had once termed a geographical imagination. They thus 
cited David Harvey (1973: 24):
This imagination enables the individual to recognize 
the role of space and place in his own biography . . . to 
relate to the spaces he sees around him, and to rec-
ognize how transactions between individuals and 
between organizations are affected by the spaces that 
separate them. It allows him to recognize the relation-
ship which exists between him and his neighbour-
hood, his territory, or, to use the language of the street 
gangs, his ‘turf’ . . . It allows him to fashion and use 
space creatively and to appreciate the meaning of the 
spatial forms created by others.

environmental and related issues that face the world in 
the early years of the twenty-first century. It is for you to 
use this book to inform your own insights and opinions 
as geographers; and to read beyond it. In other words, 
reading this textbook is the beginning of your introduc-
tion to human geography, not the end.
Today, human geography is characterized by a wide 
variety of approaches; there are many ways of writing 
geography and approaches to doing so (see Spotlight 
box I.2). The idea of a single, all-encompassing geo-
graphical approach (which may have been evident in 
times past) is not convincing anymore. Since we have 
adopting an issue-based approach, there is not the scope 
here to say much more about the evolution of debates in 
human geography. You can further explore their trajec-
tory using some of the other readings listed at the end 
of this chapter. Alternatively, track down and read Chris 
Philo’s (2008) fluent summary alongside his ‘map’ of 
changing approaches in human geography. But at this 
point please accept our word that this story (like Philo’s 
‘map’) becomes immensely complex, intertwined and 
convoluted, reflecting the intellectual trends and social 
changes mentioned earlier.
However, it is important to appreciate some shared 
concepts. Most disciplines have their central concepts 
and ideas that define what it is they study and how 
they study it. Human geography is often accused of 
borrowing ideas from elsewhere, rather than generating 
its own; but it is possible to identify a set of concepts 
that make it distinct and different. We might disagree 
on what they might mean (and each is the subject of a 
vast literature), but ideas of place, space, and scale are 
certainly central to human geography and have been for 
a long time, as has an interest in landscape, difference, 
connectivity and unevenness. All of the core ideas of 
human geography can be deployed to interrogate and 
explain the places where we live and the places where 
we travel. As geographers, we seek explanations as to 
why something came to be where it is, how places are 
experienced, connected and represented, or how the 
physical environment and nature are transformed by 
society. Chapter 12 notes how the planetary scale of 
such transformations has been re-conceptualized as 
a human-influenced geological epoch (the Anthropo-
cene). At a more personal scale, in Spotlight box I.3, 
one of the editors explains his engagements with a par-
ticular place – or set of places connected on a path. It 
is our hope that, as a practising human geographer, you 
will also find your own literal or metaphorical paths 
through this discipline and be inspired to think geo-
graphically. For us, then, human geography is a way of 
seeing, enquiring and understanding past, present and 
potential future worlds.
and society: it is about explaining how space is config-
ured and shapes economies, societies and social pro-
cesses. Thus, geography is not a passive outcome; it is 
a critical component of dynamic social and economic 
processes. More than that, geography in its broader defi-
nition provides an interface between the human and the 
natural worlds. We would argue that geography is a key 
subject for the twenty-first century, in part because many 
of the challenges that face humanity are at the interface 
between human societies and natural environments. One 
of the oldest themes of human geography (and indeed 
of geography as a whole, including its physical side) – 
human–environment relations – has become an urgent 
agenda for the twenty-first century.
Human geographers have also become more aware of 
the ways that knowledge is socially constructed. This is 
complex, reflecting ideology. But in the simplest terms, 
the way you see the world is partly a function of who 
you think you are and, hence, where you see yourself as 
coming from. Human geographers have come to realize 
that much of the knowledge and understanding that 
they claimed to be universal is in various ways Euro-
centric: it comes from somewhere and any idea that 
it is universally true (for all and everywhere) might be 
challenged. Similarly, Eurocentrism has been associated 
with a very ‘white’ view of a multi-ethnic world such as 
the fairly widespread self-perception that white folk are 
not really themselves members of a particular ‘ethnic’ 
group, except amongst racists and white supremacists. 
Yet in global terms they are arguably a distinctive ‘eth-
nic minority’ whose identity has been forged through 
comparisons and interactions with other people clas-
sified as non-white. In turn, however, such ideas about 
race and ethnicity are rooted in colonial histories (and 
hierarchies) that are evidently themselves particular 
(imperial) ways of knowing, ordering and interpreting 
the world. These resurface in contemporary racism, 
and have their own historical geography. Ideas about 
race, which today may seem self-evident and obvi-
ous, would not have been present in, for example, the 
Roman Empire, which had other ways of ordering and 
stratifying society and demarcating insiders, barbari-
ans, citizens and slaves. All this means that geographers 
must now reconsider the ways in which assumptions 
and value judgments shape the way they view the world. 
They must accept that all descriptions of the world are 
culturally determined, often politically motivated, and 
can always be contested.
So, think about your position; realize that this book 
presents the views of human geographers working at 
particular places and times. We have set out to chal-
lenge readers to think about the ways that human geog-
raphy interprets the major social, cultural, economic,

James' wanderings
One of us especially likes walking. It is a deeply geo-
graphical practice. For (even enabled by the geo-tech-
nologies of GPS and mobile Internet) it is easy to get 
lost, or find oneself in the ‘wrong’ place, or feel ‘out of 
place’, or discover new places. Walking requires an inti-
mate encounter with place, whilst negotiating space and 
landscape. James has done this often in different cities 
and written scholarly geographies about it, linking it to 
the geopolitics and memories in/of a particular one: the 
English city of Plymouth (Sidaway 2009). He is far from 
alone in this of course and his paper draws on an enor-
mous literature about walking in cities from many sites 
and a vast range of authors. But sometimes it is nice to 
get away from the city (even the one he currently lives 
in: Singapore) and walk in more remote places. So over 
the years since the third edition of this book, he has bit 
by bit been walking one of the routes there that is com-
monly referred to as the Camino de Santiago (Way of St 
James), mapped in Figure 2. As the account of another 
who walked this way has noted:
the Camino de Santiago is really a network of routes, 
many of Roman origin, extending throughout Europe

a great deal. Many of the contemporary issues discussed 
in this book, such as the geographies of development and 
of inequality, owe much to the way the world looked in 
1900, or considerably earlier. A sense of history is critical 
to an understanding of contemporary human geography. 
However, if we cast our minds even further back into the 
records of antiquity we are reminded that societies are 
transitory; nothing lasts forever. States and civilizations 
have come and gone and this should teach us that there 
is little permanent about the current world order. At the 
same time, what is past, and not always immediately 
Approach of the book
The major sections of this book focus on important issues 
facing the world, but they also relate to major sub-disci-
plines in human geography. Section 1 provides historical 
context for the four issue-oriented sections that follow. 
While it is natural for us to proclaim that geography mat-
ters, it is also the case that historical geography matters. 
A cursory examination of an atlas printed at the start of 
the last century will show you that the world has changed 
that have been used by pilgrims since the eleventh 
century to reach Santiago de Compostela [whose 
Cathedral houses the shrine dedicated to the Apostle 
St James] . . . The early medieval pilgrimage played 
an important role . . . fostered by the reigning political 
forces.
(Frey 1998: 5)
Frey's book also describes how, with the lessening 
of Christian influence in the latter half of the twenti-
eth century, the ancient pilgrimage routes declined, 
before undergoing a rapid renaissance in recent years. 
Today many thousands walk these routes daily (Plate 
2). Not all are pilgrims. Some go mostly for the exer-
cise, others for a change of scene, as a holiday, or 
as a personal or even spiritual journey that may not 
be grounded in a formal religion. But to walk it is to 
experience everyday geographies of slow movement 
– as on any other popular long-distance walking trail, 
such as those in Appalachia, the UK, Germany, New 
Zealand or on grander scales and higher altitudes in, 
say, Nepal or Peru.
Long-distance walkers must negotiate and become, 
sometimes painfully, aware of scale, topography and 
landscape. When you are walking, distances, pace, 
elevations and inclines matter fundamentally. Weather, 
food and water become things that may not be taken 
for granted, as must what you decide to carry or decide 
to leave behind (as in other travel of course: including 
those using sophisticated technologies like aircraft). 
Economic geographies and cultural geographies are 
evident: place names and language differences for 
starters; carrying enough money; where to eat and 
sleep; and who gains from all that expenditure? So are 
political geographies, if you know where to look. But 
glance up and see an aircraft far overhead – during a 
long day of remote walking perhaps – and encounter 
other walkers from across the world, or discuss where 
you started from with them, and the question of scale 
becomes more complicated. This is because, when you 
pause to think about it, any place on the path becomes 
part of a vast network extending in many directions. 
To make such a journey also links mind, body, land-
scape and movement in ways that are hard to capture 
in words: geographical imaginations may be rich, but 
some things you can only learn – or fully appreciate – by 
doing them. Moreover, others walk long distances not 
for pleasure or spiritual gain, but simply to collect water, 
seek a living or escape conflict. And other demands, 
injuries, age or disability, or preferences mean that hik-
ing long distances is not something that everyone can, 
or might want to, do.

12    INTRODUCTION
internalizes both the disadvantages of disciplinarity and 
the potential advantages of multidisciplinarity. In other 
words, as Harrison (2009: 163) notes:
it incorporates perspectives from a very wide range 
of diverse subjects from the social sciences (including 
history, sociology, politics, economics, and psychol-
ogy) and from the natural sciences (including physics, 
biology, ecology and geology). To some, this diversity 
has been regarded as a sign of weakness, suggesting a 
subject with such a broad range of research fields must 
treat those in a superficial manner. Others have seen 
it as a sign of strength, arguing that geography has 
avoided the intellectual trap of increased specializa-
tion and held on to a holistic view.
Much of the promise of geography lies on the margins 
between the sub-disciplines, between human and physical 
geography or, for example, between economic and cul-
tural geography. In your studies you should make the most 
of this promise, seek out the space on the margins and 
look for the connections between the human and natural 
environments, the economic, the social and the cultural. 
Many of the challenges that face humanity also occupy 
these margins. The emphasis on places and spaces and 
how they are interconnected, imagined and represented 
(the hallmarks of human geography) is itself promis-
ing. Engaging with such promise will deepen, stretch, 
enrich and challenge your understanding of the world. 
Geography is a worldly discipline. At once grounded 
and practical, human geography can sometimes be also 
deeply theoretical, abstract and philosophical; it mobi-
lizes words, maps and numbers, and articulates social 
sciences and the humanities, in a symbiotic relationship 
with the science of physical geography. Wherever geog-
raphy takes you intellectually and professionally, we hope 
that the chapters and arguments brought together in this 
book will (when supplemented by further reading, critical 
thought, writing and conversation) encourage you to con-
tinue to engage with the promise inherent in geography.
visible, often has a profound influence on the world we 
live in now. Section 1 highlights some of these issues and 
then focuses on the emergence of capitalism and its rela-
tionship with the making of the modern world.
It probably makes sense to work with Section 1 first; 
after that each section can be utilized in whatever order 
you see fit. It starts with a brief summary of the impor-
tant issues covered by each of the chapters and there is 
logic to the order in which the chapters are presented. 
Section 2 examines the interrelationship between popu-
lation change, resource production and consumption, 
global economic development and the environment. Sec-
tion 3 focuses on social and cultural issues within urban 
and rural contexts and at a global scale and includes a 
chapter on the social construction of nature and what 
this means for the analysis and interpretation of how, for 
example, to manage the global environment in a sustain-
able way. Section 4 examines the globalization of eco-
nomic activity, production networks, the emergence of 
a global financial system and means of exchange (which 
has played an increasingly visible role in recent decades), 
and the importance of consumption to an understand-
ing of the geography of economy. Section 5 considers a 
variety of political geographies at differing scales and 
how they interface and intertwine. Here too the sense 
of continuity and change is evident, as in shifting global 
geopolitical scenarios since the decline of the old super-
power Cold War confrontation between the Soviet Union 
and the USA that had lasted for 50 years from the 1940s 
to the 1990s and whose legacies remain active today.
So, where else do you go from here? As a geography 
student (or any other kind of student for that matter), 
you may be faced with choices, for example between 
human and physical geography or between more spe-
cialized subjects within one of those traditions. It is in 
the nature of academic disciplines to subdivide and to 
compartmentalize knowledge. Geography is unusual in 
that it sits at the intersections between the humanities, 
social sciences and natural sciences. This means that it

(such as auto-biographies of influential geographers) that 
are hard to categorize. You should also seek out the various

by publishers, these have proliferated in recent years, along 
with encyclopedias, dictionaries and companions to the disci-

most influential readings in a particular area of human geog-
raphy, whilst others are collections of specially commissioned

British-style educational system were long imposed on many

tematic reflections on the relative position of geography in the 
academy in a range of countries, see the set of papers in the

by and following a brief introduction by Kong (2007) (see

it is full of ideas and guides to research and geographical

to describe:

Like other even seedier sides of the Net, these have their 
own geography, in terms of by whom and where they are pro-
duced, where the money goes, plus the spatiality of the wider 
economies, trends and technologies that enable them. In the 
words of a geographical account of these published more 
than a decade ago:
The technology of the Internet has connected remote 
places and facilitated the diffusion of any number of 
economic activities such as call centers, off-shore bank-
ing, and data processing. The Internet adult industry is 
yet another example of how a combination of regulatory 
issues, lower costs for content, and low barriers to entry 
results in a restructuring of production and consumption. 
While allowing access to a whole new range of people, 
the Internet is still shaped by existing structures of regula-
tion, power, and hegemony. In short, the space of flows 
cannot be understood without reference to the ‘space of 
places’ to which it connects.

Section 1
Worlds in the past:
Changing scales of experience and  
past worlds in the present
Edited by Denis Shaw

The world in which we live today has been 
moulded and is constantly being remoulded by 
the forces of capitalism (defined in Chapter 2, 
pp. 38–9). As modern capitalism spread across 
the globe it inevitably changed the societies which 
preceded it. But the pre-capitalist societies, while 
adapting to capitalism, did not necessarily lose 
all their distinctive features, and capitalism itself 
was configured through the process of interact-
ing with them. The fact that human societies in 
the modern world differ among themselves in all 
kinds of ways is only partly the result of the way 
global capitalism works and of the ways in which 
societies are now adapting to the various forces 
affecting them. Societies also differ because of 
their past histories, histories that stretch back 
into pre-capitalist times. The world into which 
modern capitalism spread was itself already enor-
mously varied and had been changing in innumer-
able ways over thousands of years. This section 
presents a brief survey of that long history and 
argues that the human geographer cannot under-
stand the ­present-day world without knowledge of 
the worlds which have existed in the past.
Chapter 1 of this section considers what the world 
was like before capitalism and what if any gener-
alizations can be made about this long period of 
human history. Chapter 2 analyses the rise and 
spread of modern capitalism down to the end of the 
nineteenth century. Its history during this period is 
intimately linked to the rise of the European powers 
and to the worldwide spread of their influence. This, 
of course, is not to deny that capitalism probably 
sprouted, and then died, in other societies in other 
periods, or that it might have gained worldwide sig-
nificance on the basis of a non-European core had 
circumstances been different. During the twentieth 
and twenty-first centuries, which are the subject of 
Chapter 3, capitalism became a truly global phe-
nomenon and radically changed in the process. 
This chapter thus provides a more immediate back-
ground for the ­sections that follow.
In summary, this part of the book emphasizes the 
variety and complexity of the world before globali-
zation. And it demonstrates that only by knowing 
something about that world can we understand 
globalization itself.

20    Section 1  Worlds in the Past: Changing Scales of Experience and Past Worlds in the Present
M
uch of this book is about how capitalism has spread 
across the globe and even now is remoulding human 
societies in new and unexpected ways. This chapter is 
about what the world was like before capitalism. In other 
words it is about how human beings have lived during 
most of their existence on this planet. It will also say 
something about why it is important for human geogra-
phers to be aware of that past.
Capitalism has changed the world profoundly and 
often very quickly. In the first half of the twentieth cen-
tury it was still possible for geographers and others to 
travel to regions where its influence was minimal and 
where people still lived in pre-capitalist societies. Today 
this is much less true. Even so, the geographer can still 
find numerous areas where the way of life has many pre-
capitalist traits, though perhaps increasingly influenced 
by the modern world. Let us consider some examples.
About 2 per cent of the population of Australia 
identifies as Aboriginal; whose ancestors first settled 
the continent up to 50,000 years before white Europe-
ans (Broome 2002). Today their way of life ranges from 
that of suburban professionals to remote outstations 
and homelands where people live partly off the land in 
traditional style. When the British established their first 
penal colony on Australian soil in 1788, more Aborigines 
lived on the continent than today, and they were divided 
into some 500 groups displaying a wide variety of lan-
guages, cultures, economies and technologies. All were 
hunters and gatherers leading a semi-nomadic existence 
and using some similar tools, like stone core hammers, 
knives, scrapers and axe heads as well as wooden imple-
ments like spears, digging sticks and drinking vessels. 
However, there was also a variety in technology and 
economy that reflected the diverse environments in which 
Aboriginal peoples lived. Whether living on coasts, river-
banks, in woodland or desert regions, they were efficient 
and skilled at exploiting the flora and fauna of their sur-
roundings. Aboriginal peoples who hunt and fish today 
are often using skills honed by their ancestors over thou-
sands of years. Their languages and cultures similarly 
reflect the experiences of many hundreds of generations.
The Inuit or Eskimo peoples living in the Arctic, 
mainly coastal, territories of Greenland, northern Can-
ada, Alaska and the extreme eastern tip of Russia, are 
another group who in the past lived almost entirely by 
hunting and gathering (Sugden 1982; Bone 2009). Hunt-
ing and gathering still plays an important role in many 
of the remoter communities. Like the Australian Aborigi-
nes, the Inuit showed a remarkable ability to exploit the 
resources of what, in their case, is an extremely harsh 
environment. Because of their environment, Inuit com-
munities demonstrated less economic variation than the 
Aborigines but they were far from uniform. There were 
marked seasonal movements depending on the character 
of the local resources as groups moved between exploit-
ing the fish and mammals of the open ocean, hunting 
seals on the ice, and seeking caribou, musk ox and simi-
lar fauna inland. The rich Inuit culture is also varied but 
by no means as varied as the Aboriginal (there are only 
two interrelated languages, for example). Considering 
the vast geographical spaces that the Inuit occupy, the 
latter fact is remarkable and may reflect a relative ease 
of communication by sledge and boat as well as the fre-
quency of migrations. Like the Aborigines, the Inuit have 
had to adapt in the recent period to an intrusive, mainly 
white culture, but are still sufficiently conscious of their 
­distinctive histories and life-styles to have a strong sense 
of identity.
The Australian Aborigines and the Inuit are but two 
of many human groups existing either now or in the 
recent past who have lived by hunting and gathering (see 
Figure 1.1). The present-day world also contains other 
groups whose way of life to a greater or lesser extent 
reflects pre-capitalist characteristics. Pastoral nomads, 
for example, live mainly by raising and herding domestic 
animals (cattle, sheep, goats, camels, yak, reindeer and 
others), that provide them with food, clothing and other 
necessities. Pastoralists are particularly found in marginal 
(semi-arid, sub-arctic, sub-alpine) lands in parts of Eura-
sia and Africa (see Plate  1.1). Another example is the 
many peasant farmers still to be found in parts of sub-
Saharan Africa, southern Asia and elsewhere. Some still 
grow much of their own food and market relationships 
have yet to become of central importance to their lives 
(Wolf 1966). To the extent that such people eat and oth-
erwise depend on what they grow and raise rather than 
on what they can sell or earn outside the farm, their way 
of life is similar to that of peasants over the centuries. 
Of course, nowadays the number of peasants is declin-
ing and they are increasingly exposed to the influences of 
the outside world. But again they remind us of a world 
before capitalism.
The point, then, is that today’s world still contains 
many societies whose ways of life differ from those lived 
by most of this book’s readers and which recall earlier 
periods in human history. In order to understand those 
ways of life and the world as it is now, the geographer 
must know something about the world before capitalism. 
Learning about that world helps us to see how capitalism 
has changed the world and the pluses and minuses of 
that process.
A number of arguments can be advanced to suggest 
why it is important to know something about the world 
before capitalism:
Understanding the past helps geographers and others 
to understand themselves and their societies. Societies

and individuals are products of the past, not just of the 
present. The present cannot be understood in ignorance 
of the past. Studying the past provides answers not merely 
to questions about how things were but also about how 
things are now (and, more tentatively, about how things 
will be in the future).
An example of the latter is the character of the physi-
cal environment in which people now live. Human beings 
have lived on this planet for so many thousands of years 
that over vast areas the physical environment has been 
profoundly modified. The world today is the product of 
thousands of generations of human activity. In fact, can

One reason why Rostow oversimplified the pre-
industrial past was that he was not much interested in 
it. He was really interested in modernity, as exemplified 
by the United States and its Western allies. Furthermore, 
his theory can be described as ‘unilinear evolutionary’ 
inasmuch as it suggested that all societies should pass 
through a series of set stages of economic development 
before finally arriving at the age of ‘high mass consump-
tion’. The United States (where Rostow lived) and other 
‘developed’ countries have already reached this age. Evo-
lutionary models have certainly long been a popular way 
for Western societies to try to make sense of the past. 
One of the attractions of such models has no doubt been 
their tendency to suggest that the West is the most ‘devel-
oped’ and thus most ‘progressive’ part of the world and, 
by implication, the best (and a model for development:  
see Chapter  8, pp. 177–9). But quite apart from the 
questionable assumption that all societies should seek 
to imitate the West, this raises important issues about 
the meaning of ‘progress’ and ‘development’, two terms 
that certainly carry very positive connotations in the 
West. For example, while those parts of the world usu-
ally deemed most developed and wealthiest certainly use 
most energy (see Chapter 5) and enjoy access to more 
material goods, they also make huge demands on the 
environment, perhaps ultimately to everyone’s undoing. 
Thus, what is progress in this context? Similarly, it has 
often been noted that the price people tend to pay for 
more ‘development’ and wealth is that they have to work 
harder and for more hours. Unless hard work is regarded 
as a virtue in itself, this again raises questions about the 
meaning of progress. The point here is not to disparage 
all forms of evolutionary theory or idea (for example, to 
deny that human societies have, by and large, become 
more complex and spatially extended through time; see 
Dodgshon 1987). Rather, it is to suggest that what is most 
recent or new or complex is not necessarily best. Thus, in 
what follows, words like ‘modern’ do not imply ‘better’, 
nor do ‘ancient’ or ‘primitive’ imply ‘worse’.
An alternative method of trying to make sense of 
the past, and one that does not have the unilinear evo-
lutionary structure of, say, Rostow’s theory, is to classify 
human societies into a series of types. Classification can 
be described as a way of simplifying a complex world 
by grouping together phenomena that are regarded as 
having some common feature or property, particularly 
where the latter is deemed especially significant. Thus 
Marxists have commonly grouped societies in accord-
ance with their prevailing mode of production, or in 
other words with the way in which material production 
is related to social structure (Hindess and Hirst 1975). 
As a geographer, primarily interested in spatial structure, 
Robert Sack classified societies in accordance with their 
any of the world’s landscapes now be said to be truly 
‘natural’? (The implications of this are explained in 
Chapter 12.) This shows us that it is likely that human 
activity will continue to modify our environment into the 
future. Keeping the environment exactly as it is now is a 
very unlikely option. But how far we can control those 
changes, or keep them within acceptable limits, is a more 
difficult question.
A further important point is that Aborigines, Inuit and 
other indigenous peoples (those peoples native to a 
particular territory that was later colonized, particularly 
by Europeans) have recently been asserting their rights. 
For example, Australian Aborigines have asserted their 
right to be recognized as part of the Australian national 
identity, pointing out that the story of Australia does 
not begin with Captain Cook’s landing in 1788, as the 
whites have so often assumed, since the Aborigines were 
in Australia long before. Indigenous peoples have also 
been claiming rights to local resources long ago usurped 
by outsiders and are trying to protect their distinctive cul-
tures. Such peoples often feel they are the victims of the 
past. By studying that past and trying to understand the 
variety of cultures and ways of life that exist in the world 
and how they came to be, geographers are more likely to 
understand and respect such feelings.
Thus, while human geography is primarily about the 
present, it cannot afford to ignore the past. Some of the 
above points will be illustrated in the following pages.
1.1	 Making sense of the past
Despite the spread of capitalism and globalization, the 
world of today remains immensely varied and complex. 
The same is true of the world in the past. The question 
for the geographer is how to make sense of this complex 
past; how to make it amenable to geographical analysis 
and understanding.
Different scholars have tried different ways of answer-
ing this question, but all suffer from shortcomings. For 
example, the economist W.W. Rostow, in his famous 
theory of economic growth typical of capitalist develop-
ment, simply described the pre-industrial period as ‘tra-
ditional society’ (Rostow 1971: 4–6). Yet the fact is that 
pre-industrial human societies ranged from the smallest 
communities of hunters and gatherers to societies as 
sophisticated and geographically extended as the Roman 
Empire, ancient China and feudal Europe. Inasmuch as 
such societies existed in the past, and not today, it is not 
possible to observe them directly. But the more scholars 
learn about them, the more they realize how unlike one 
another these early societies were.

Chapter 1  Pre-capitalist worlds    23
one important point. Our knowledge of prehistoric soci-
eties (societies which have left no written records) derives 
mainly from archaeological data, or material left by such 
societies and the traces of their environmental impacts. 
Methods for analysing such data have become ever more 
sophisticated, but the data themselves obviously become 
scarcer the older they are. Moreover, there are many kinds 
of questions, for example about the way early people 
viewed the world around them, which cannot be answered 
directly from the archaeological evidence. New discoveries 
are always liable to change our understanding of past soci-
eties, and especially of the earliest ones. Our knowledge 
of the latter societies, and of the dates attaching to them, 
must therefore be regarded as especially tentative.
1.3	 Hunting and gathering
The time when the first human-type species (hominids) 
first appeared on earth is very uncertain, but a date of 
at least two and a half million years ago is often given. 
Homo erectus, believed by some to be the forerunner of 
the modern human species, is thought to have appeared 
around 1.9 million years ago, and the modern species 
(Homo sapiens sapiens) at least 40,000 years ago (but see 
Foley 1995 for a contrary view). Since agriculture appears 
to have arisen about 12,000 years ago, hunting and gath-
ering in bands have been the basic occupations for much 
of humanity’s existence (see Spotlight box 1.1).
As noted already, only a limited amount is known 
about early human societies (see Plate  1.2). In addition 
to archaeological evidence, much has to be inferred, for 
example from hunter-gatherers who are still in existence 
or who existed until quite recently. Needless to say, such 
inference can be dangerous because modern hunter-
gatherers have probably been influenced by other, more 
‘advanced’, societies that now share their world. Their 
way of life is thus unlikely to be identical with those who 
existed in the remote past (Barnard 2004).
The distribution of hunter-gatherers in the recent 
past shows that they have existed in every major climatic 
zone and have practised enormously varied economies, 
depending on the nature and potentials of the local envi-
ronment (Figure 1.1). This fact alone suggests that a sim-
plistic evolutionary model of human societies will fail to 
do justice to their complex histories. Some generaliza-
tions do seem possible, however – for example, that in 
recent times groups living in the highest latitudes (above 
60 degrees) have relied largely on hunting, and those 
below 39 degrees on plant collecting. Fishing seems to 
have played an important role for many groups living in 
intermediate latitudes (Lee 1968; Oppenheimer 2012).
use of territoriality (Sack 1986) (a theme taken up in 
­Chapter 21). The point is that there is no right or wrong 
mode of classification. It all depends on what the purpose 
of the classification is. Most social theorists have wanted 
to claim that their mode of classifying societies is particu-
larly significant for understanding how and why societies 
differ. The problem is that there is a large measure of 
disagreement about what the best mode is, and each has 
its shortcomings.
1.2	 A classification of human societies
As an example of the kinds of difficulties that face any 
attempt to classify past and present human societies, 
this chapter will focus on one mode of classification 
that has had widespread appeal not only for human 
geographers but also for anthropologists and other 
scholars. This is the mode of classifying human socie-
ties into bands, tribes, chiefdoms and states (regulated 
and market-based) (see Bobek 1962; Dodgshon 1987). 
Spotlight boxes 1.1 to 1.5 describe, in simplified form, 
the major characteristics of each type of human society 
according to this classification. It will quickly be seen 
that the classification describes a range of societies from 
the simplest and most primitive to the capitalist societies 
of today. What it does not suggest is the circumstances 
under which one kind of society may change into, or be 
succeeded, by another.
One reason why this mode of classification has had 
such appeal is because it suggests that over the course of 
human history larger and more complex societies have 
tended to appear. It also relates size and complexity to the 
way societies occupy space and their relationships to their 
physical environment. However, it is worth reiterating 
that this is only one way of classifying human societies. 
Indeed some scholars reject the whole idea of classifying 
human societies because they feel it leads to misappre-
hensions about how societies are formed and survive, and 
even to dangerous notions of unilinear evolution. It thus 
needs to be remembered that this scheme is suggestive 
only, and does not necessarily describe the way any given 
society has actually changed through time. In particular, 
it does not stipulate that societies must develop through a 
series of set stages, or that one type of society necessarily 
leads to the next.
Subsequent sections will outline some of the social pro-
cesses that might have helped to produce, change and per-
haps destroy the different kinds of human society described 
in Spotlight boxes 1.1 to 1.5. In so doing, some of the 
limitations of the classification system used will become 
apparent. Before proceeding, however, it is worth making

major biomes as the African savannas and the prairies 
of North America is the result of the human use of fire 
over thousands of years (Simmons 1996). More recently, 
contacts between hunter-gatherers and agricultural and 
industrial societies frequently had even more far-reaching 
environmental effects. At the same time, other scholars 
have asserted that the relations between such groups and 
their physical environments were rarely if ever exploita-
tive in the modern sense. Hunter-gatherers lived in an inti-
mate relationship with their environment and frequently 
regarded it, or aspects of it, as sacred. Some scholars 
have thus described their relationship as ‘organic’ in a 
way which has been forgotten by our modern societies, 
much to the detriment of today’s global environment 
(Merchant 2005).
Scholars have wondered about processes whereby 
bands evolved into tribes, or hunter-gathering economies 
Hunter-gatherers have lived in this world for such 
a long period that today’s environment is the way it is 
partly as a result of their activities. For example, any 
notion that early human beings lived in complete har-
mony with their environments or always had ‘sustainable’ 
economies is simply untrue. Thus hunter-gatherers are 
credited with the extinction of many animals. An out-
standing case is North America where perhaps two-thirds 
of the large mammal fauna living there just before the 
arrival of the ancestors of modern native Americans (via 
the Bering land bridge, possibly about 12,000 years ago) 
subsequently disappeared. The most likely explanation 
is the effects of hunting. The discovery of fire, its use by 
hominids long predating the appearance of Homo sapi-
ens sapiens, was also an important instrument whereby 
human beings changed their environments. Some schol-
ars have argued that the present-day appearance of such

Bands
● Bands are societies of hunter-gatherers. Most of 
human history has been lived in this way.
● Bands live by hunting wild animals and gathering 
food from the surrounding flora.
● Because of the pressures they place on the surround-
ing environment, bands are almost always nomadic.
● Bands are the smallest and simplest of human 
groups.
● Bands rarely exceed 500 people.
● For most of the time band members generally live in 
smaller groups of 25–100 people, which allows for 
efficient exploitation of the environment.
● Bands usually have a minimum of social differentia-
tion and functional specialization.

Chapter 1  Pre-capitalist worlds    25
scholars, for example, doubt whether the category ‘tribe’ 
(Spotlight box 1.2) is particularly helpful, implying as it 
does the lack of a hierarchical social structure (Fried-
man and Rowlands 1977). Such scholars tend to believe 
that the appearance of agriculture will have sparked off 
competition for access to the best land, or at least rules 
whereby such land was allocated and inherited, and that 
some people and groups will inevitably have lost out. 
They therefore see a social hierarchy (characteristic of 
chiefdoms and states – see Spotlight boxes 1.3 and 1.4) 
beginning to emerge even as agriculture and the process 
of permanent settlement began.
Be that as it may, it is now widely accepted that the 
traditional picture of agriculture being invented in a 
small number of ‘hearths’ and then spreading across the 
globe is far too simple. Bands of hunters and gatherers 
are known to develop an often intimate knowledge of 
their local environments, and no doubt human beings 
understood much about the factors influencing plant and 
animal development long before they began to practise 
into agricultural ones (Harris 1996a, 1996b). It has been 
pointed out, for example, that where the natural envi-
ronment was especially favourable, the packing of bands 
tended to be denser, leading to less mobility and per-
haps to semi-permanent settlement and closer interac-
tion between bands. There may also have been a much 
greater degree of manipulation of the environment and 
its resources than might be expected in a pure hunter-
gatherer economy. Altogether the life of bands was much 
more variable and a good deal less stable than the above 
classification scheme suggests. The boundary between 
band and tribe is thus blurred.
1.4	 Human settlement and agriculture
Just as the boundary line between band and tribe may 
not always be easy to define in practice, the same can be 
said of the boundary between tribe and chiefdom. Some 
Spotlight box 1.2
Tribes
● Tribes appeared with the invention and spread of 
agriculture.
● Agriculture usually demands considerable invest-
ment of human effort into a relatively small area. 
This reduces the propensity to migrate (but pastoral 
nomads are an exception).
● The appearance of agriculture usually allows more 
people to live in a smaller space.
● Agricultural societies thus tend to be bigger than 
bands, with higher population densities.
● Settlements tend to become more fixed than in 
bands.
● The greater spatial fixity of society encourages 
intermarriage and the development of extended 
family networks. Tribes thus develop a sense of kin-
ship and of common descent.
● Socially, tribes are relatively egalitarian, at least as 
between kinship groups.
Spotlight box 1.3
Chiefdoms
● Chiefdoms arose with the emergence of ‘ranked 
and stratified’ societies.
● ‘Ranked’ societies are societies where groups and 
individuals have, on a relatively permanent basis, 
different degrees of status and power.
● ‘Stratified’ societies are societies where groups and 
individuals have, on a relatively permanent basis, 
different degrees of material wealth.
● A chiefdom implies the presence of a permanent 
ruling group and/or individual, though kinship 
remains the chief bond between ruler and 
subject.
● Chiefdoms imply a greater degree of centralization 
and control within society than in a tribe (shown, 
for example, in the imposition of taxes and tribute 
on the ordinary subjects). Spatially this might be 
reflected in the greater importance accorded to 
a central settlement (proto-city) where the ruler 
resides.
● The first chiefdoms began to appear about 3000 BC 
in Europe, but earlier elsewhere.

gathering, hardly applies to naturally productive envi-
ronments where it clearly involved much greater effort 
relative to the return achieved. Some scholars favour pop-
ulation pressure. Others, however, argue that this view is 
over-deterministic and point out that even hunter-gath-
erers had the means of controlling population growth. 
Such scholars tend to favour more complex explanations 
that embrace cultural preferences and choices as well as 
environmental and population pressures (Maisels 1993: 
25–31).
Just as the factors that led up to the appearance and 
spread of agriculture are by no means straightforward, 
the same is also true of its further development. No sim-
ple evolutionary model can account for how agriculture 
has changed and developed throughout the world. Every­
where traditional agriculturalists showed a remarkable 
ability to adapt their practices to local environmental 
conditions. Eventually they largely displaced the hunter-
gatherers (Figure 1.2) and gave rise to an enormous vari-
ety of agricultural systems.
Agriculture’s effects on the landscape were much 
greater than the effects of hunting and gathering. It 
changed the vegetation cover of wide areas as forests and 
grasslands disappeared under fields, practices like terrac-
ing and irrigation were introduced, and the effects on soil 
composition abetted erosion in some places. The grazing 
of animals and other forms of resource use frequently 
full-blown agriculture. David Harris (1989, 1996a, 1996b) 
argued that the development of agriculture was a long 
drawn-out affair and that there must have been much trial 
and error before it finally emerged in some places in a 
fully recognizable form. Some prehistoric northern Aus-
tralian Aborigines, for example, knew about agriculture, 
but never adopted it.
Something can, however, be said about when, and 
perhaps why, agriculture appeared. The archaeologi-
cal evidence makes it possible to detect and date the 
remains of domesticated varieties of plants and animals. 
According to Simmons (1996: 93) there were probably 
three foci for the initial surges of domestication: around 
7000 BC (to use the Christian chronology) in south-west 
Asia, around 6000 BC in south-east Asia, and around 
5000 BC in Meso-America. Different species of plants 
were associated with each, for example: wheat, barley 
and oats in south-west Asia; rice in south-east Asia; and 
maize, squash and gourds in Meso-America. Domesti-
cated animals also began to appear about the same time 
(though the dog, domesticated from the wolf, appeared 
before agriculture). Sheep, goats, pigs and cattle are 
all associated with south-west Asia (Simmons 1996: 
87–134), though pigs may also have been domesticated 
independently in eastern Asia.
As to why agriculture was adopted, scholars differ. The 
simple answer, that it was more efficient than hunting and

Regulated (pre-modern) states
● Whereas the chiefdom is organized around the prin-
ciple of kinship, the state is organized on the basis 
of territory (viz. one is subject to the state if one 
resides in the territory of that state).
● States, whilst also based on social inequality, tend 
to be larger and administratively more complex than 
chiefdoms. This implies greater functional specializa-
tion and greater probability of the rise of urban forms.
● Pre-modern states existed in a world before mod-
ern capitalism. The market was not central to their 
functioning and was often controlled (‘regulated’) 
in various ways. Thus economic relationships were 
generally subordinated to political, social and reli-
gious considerations.
● Other forms of social relationship, for instance 
landholding, also often tended to be controlled 
(regulated) rather than being determined by the 
market.
Spotlight box 1.5
Market-based states
● Market-based states are modern states whose 
development is closely linked to that of capitalism 
and thus of the world economy.
● The market is of key importance to their 
functioning.
● In the last two centuries these states have been 
associated with colonial and national projects (see 
Chapters 2, 3 and 22).

racial and cultural characteristics which equipped them 
to dominate the ‘inferior’ Celtic peoples. Similar ideas, of 
course, reached their ultimate absurdity in the racist theo-
ries propounded by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Nowa-
days, with the availability of new scientific approaches 
like molecular archaeology and DNA studies, we know 
that the origins of the English and of other peoples are 
much more complex than was once thought and that 
‘different’ peoples are in fact remarkably similar in their 
capabilities (Miles 2006: 18–31; Oppenheimer 2012). Dif-
ferent human groups, settling in the same region, may 
gradually have adopted similar languages and cultural 
patterns, thus slowly fusing into one people or ethnic 
group even though they were not originally closely inter-
related. In this way the study of even the remote past can 
cast light on issues which cause contention today and, 
as in this case, help to discredit theories based on crude 
racist prejudices and a misreading of history.
1.5	 Cities and civilization
The invention of agriculture was only one of the events 
that moved human societies along a road that ultimately 
led to the kinds of societies which predominate in the 
world today. Others included the appearance of cit-
ies, states and civilizations. Cities and states usually 
go together. Maisels (1993: 302), for example, argues 
that the functional specialization associated with cit-
ies allowed rulers to rule more effectively and also to 
put a greater social distance between them and their 
changed the species composition of forests, grasslands 
and other areas. Agricultural systems, crops and domes-
ticated animals spread way beyond their initial locations. 
An outstanding example is the cultivation of rice, which 
may have started in east Asia around 5000 BC, if not 
before, and spread as far as Egypt and Sicily by Roman 
times. Such developments long preceded the European 
overseas expansion beginning in the fifteenth century AD, 
which was to have even more far-reaching consequences 
both for the geography of agriculture and for the environ-
ment (see Chapter 2, pp. 42–7; Crosby 2004).
There is no doubt that the spread of agriculture 
(whether as a result of migration or through cultural dif-
fusion) had far-reaching effects on human society, encour-
aging permanent settlement and the emergence of tribal 
systems (though Crone, 2003, questions the nature of the 
link between agriculture and tribes). Tribal members, 
living permanently side by side, almost inevitably devel-
oped similar cultural traits such as common languages. 
As suggested in Spotlight box 1.2, tribes also typically 
develop myths of common ancestry (indeed, this seems 
to be part of their definition). In the late nineteenth and 
early twentieth centuries, a period much influenced by 
ideas based on Darwinian evolution as well as by myths 
of European racial and cultural superiority bolstered by 
European overseas imperial expansion, it became fash-
ionable, on very limited evidence, for scholars to imagine 
that modern ethnic differences have a biological basis and 
that certain ‘races’ or ethnic groups are inherently supe-
rior to others. In Britain, for example, many historians 
and archaeologists regarded the modern English as deriv-
ing almost entirely from Anglo-Saxon invaders with both

with the Shang dynasty, arose about 1500 bc, and by 
about 1000 BC the Maya civilization had appeared in 
Meso-America. In Europe the first states are commonly 
taken to be the Greek city-states that began to develop 
in eastern Greece and the neighbouring islands about 
the eighth century bc. Whether the state arose indepen-
dently in different places across the globe, or whether the 
idea of the state was somehow diffused from one or two 
initial foci, is uncertain.
Early states took many different forms. All faced dif-
ficulty in enforcing and maintaining their territoriality in 
the context of poor communications, and different states 
approached this problem in different ways. The Greek 
city-states, for example, typically occupied only small 
areas and restricted their population sizes. When popu-
lation in any one state exceeded a certain threshold, that 
state would found a self-governing colony elsewhere on 
the sea coast. Travel by sea was generally easier than over-
land travel and thus settlements could keep in touch (see 
Plate  1.4). In this way the Greeks eventually colonized 
much of the eastern Mediterranean coast (Figure 1.3). 
The huge Roman Empire, by contrast, could not rely 
solely on sea travel. This was a much more centralized 
polity and only by having superb military organization, 
an elaborate system of roads and fortifications, good 
administration, and a state-controlled religion centred 
on the person of the emperor, could it survive for several 
centuries (Figure 1.4 and Case study 1.1). The Mongol 
Empire was also very extensive, controlling much of 
Asia and a good slice of central and eastern Europe in 
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries AD. The Mongols 
were pastoral nomads whose formidable warrior skills 
were based on their horsemanship and their ability to 
outmanoeuvre their enemies. But nomadic empires had a 
tendency to contract as quickly as they arose. It was dif-
ficult for the emperor to maintain control over his swift-
moving armies of mounted warriors. Finally, medieval 
Europe’s answer to the problem of territoriality was to 
decentralize political power through kings to territorial 
lords and minor nobles (see Case study 1.2). In return 
for their rights to their land and other privileges, lesser 
nobles owed their lords a duty of military support in time 
of need, which meant having to appear with an army of 
knights, retainers and other soldiers when ordered to do 
so. The lords in turn owed loyalty to their overlords, and 
so on in a hierarchy that ended with kings or other rulers. 
Medieval European states were thus quite decentralized 
and unstable, as regional lords and their underlings were 
often tempted to rebel (Figure 1.5). Only after centuries 
of struggle between rulers, lords and ordinary subjects 
did the European states of today finally appear.
What all this tells us is that the present-day pattern of 
states is contingent on and the outcome of quite random 
subjects. The gathering of specialists around the person 
of a state’s ruler fostered urban life, commerce and the 
many other things (such as writing, technology, religion 
and speculative thought) with which is associated the 
word ‘civilization’. Indeed, the very words ‘city’ and 
‘civilization’ have a common Latin root (civitas, mean-
ing ‘state’).
As is the case with the appearance of agriculture, the 
processes that eventually gave rise to cities and civiliza-
tions are far from straightforward. It is clear that the 
development of a social hierarchy was a necessary pre-
cursor, but what produced that? Different scholars have 
debated the merits of alternative potential causes such 
as land shortages, inheritance rules, or the emergence of 
particularly strong or charismatic individuals. But while 
these and other factors may have produced chiefdoms 
(see Spotlight box 1.3), something more seems to be 
required to explain the rise of cities, states and civiliza-
tions. As Maisels writes, chiefs enjoy only ‘hegemony’ 
over their peoples, and are bound by rules of kinship 
which imply mutual obligations. Chiefdoms were noto-
riously unstable. Kings and other state rulers, by contrast, 
exercise ‘sovereignty’ (ultimate power) over a territory 
and its peoples (Maisels 1993: 199). Thus scholars have 
cast around for particular factors which enabled individ-
ual leaders to have their power recognized as legitimate 
by subject peoples and persuaded the latter to pay over 
the tribute, food surpluses and services which cities and 
rulers required to maintain themselves in existence. Such 
particular factors might have included religious sanc-
tions, military skills or organizing power. The problem 
is to show how the kind of social inequality that might 
be produced by such processes then transforms itself 
into the stable and legitimate power that a ruling group 
exercises in the state. Some scholars, therefore, have pro-
posed that states came into being as a result of different 
processes working together in a contingent way rather 
than being caused deterministically by a single overriding 
process (Maisels 1993: 199–220).
Whatever may be the explanation for the initial devel-
opment of states and associated cities, they gave rise to 
major changes in human societies (see Spotlight box 1.4). 
Rather than being organized around the principle of kin-
ship like the tribe and the chiefdom, for example, states 
were organized on the territorial principle. This means 
that the rulers of states exercised their rule over defined 
territories and their inhabitants, no matter who the latter 
happened to be. This proved an extremely powerful way 
of organizing human societies. States thus appeared in 
different parts of the globe. The first organized states are 
believed to have developed in Sumer in present-day Iraq 
around 3000 BC. According to Maisels, these took the 
form of city-states. In China the first state, associated

the outcomes might have been totally different. In other 
words, there was no historical inevitability about the

might like to think. Often enough state-building has

Case study 1.1 
The Roman Empire at its zenith  
(first to fourth centuries AD)
The Roman Empire was one of the greatest achieve-
ments of state-building in the pre-modern period and 
is testimony to the way in which huge distances could 
be crossed and enormous territories controlled in 
spite of the absence of modern industrial technolo-
gies. At its greatest extent the empire’s east–west 
axis stretched from the Caucasus to Cape Finisterre 
in north-west Spain, a distance of about 2,800 miles. 
North–south it reached from Hadrian’s Wall, near the

Case study 1.2 
European feudalism
■ Feudal society was hierarchical – ranked and 
stratified.
■ The majority of the population were subsistence farm-
ers, engaged in extensive forms of agriculture (for 
example, by cultivating strips in open fields shared 
with others, raising some livestock) and exploiting 
local resources like pastureland, woodland and fish.
■ Many of the rural population were obligated to their 
lords and landholders, for example not to move away 
from their villages, to work the lord’s land, to pay the 
tribute and taxes the lord and the state required, to 
serve the lord militarily and to perform other services.
■ Lords held their land conditionally from their overlord 
and ultimately from the king or other ruler. Land could 
not easily be sold. Lords exercised jurisdiction over 
those living on their estates.
■ Lords owed allegiance to their overlords (and they 
in turn to their overlords and so on), for example in 
supporting them with their military forces and per-
forming other services as required.
■ Feudal states were quite decentralized, parcelled out 
into lordships and they in turn into jurisdictions of vari-
ous kinds.
■ Towns were generally small and few and far between 
(see Plate  1.3). Most were centres of trade and 
crafts. Their residents (merchants, burgesses) often 
enjoyed freedoms and privileges (‘liberties’) denied to 
most rural dwellers.
■ Merchants and itinerant traders joined together net-
works of local and long-distance trade, linking local 
fairs and markets with towns, ports and so on. Craft 
production and trade were generally subject to a vari-
ety of restrictions and controls, and often played only 
a minor role in the lives of rural dwellers.
■ The medieval world-view was strongly influenced 
by the Church, whose priests and officials were 
among the few educated people and were universally 
present.
present-day Anglo-Scottish border, to the fringes of the 
Sahara in North Africa, some 1,600 miles. The empire 
was characterized by two major languages (Latin and 
Greek), low tariff barriers, a common currency, a com-
mon code of laws, and the basis of a common system 
of education and culture for the Romanized elite. 
Rome was a truly ‘universal state’, which lasted in its 
mature form for half a millennium, and in its eastern 
(Byzantine) manifestation until the capture of Constan-
tinople by the Turks in 1453.
Like all early states, Rome had problems in enforcing 
its territoriality – the sheer scale of the empire meant 
that there were always difficulties in maintaining control 
over its far-flung provinces. That the empire was able to 
endure for so long (albeit with many vicissitudes) was 
a tribute to its highly developed capacity for organiza-
tion and an astuteness in gaining and retaining local 
loyalties. The acquisition of new territories proceeded 
by a mixture of conquest, colonization by Roman and 
Latin colonists, the establishment of vassal kingdoms 
and powers, alliances (often forced) and other means. 
The Roman army, reformed by the Emperor Augustus 
after 13 BC, was a masterpiece of military organiza-
tion superior to any of Rome’s enemies in this period. 
The seas and waterways were patrolled by the navy, 
protecting merchant shipping. Towns and military bases 
were interconnected by a network of fine roads, and an 
official transport system (the cursus publicus) with inns 
and posting stations at regular intervals speeded official 
communications. There were even roadbooks (itiner-
aria) for the guidance of the many travellers, including 
some tourists. Fortified lines, of which Hadrian’s Wall 
is the most celebrated, protected the most vulnerable 
frontiers. But the empire was not held together only by 
military force. It was also by judicious extensions of 
Roman citizenship and other privileges to local elites, 
and by fostering helpful religious practices like emperor 
worship, that local loyalties were ensured.
The empire’s economic and cultural achievements 
were many. Long-distance trade in such items as 
grain, metals and luxury goods was important, for 
example, though there were many hindrances to com-
merce and most people depended on local agriculture 
and manufacture. It must also be remembered that 
there was a heavy dependence on slavery. In the end 
the Romans could never be assured of political sta-
bility, even in their heartlands. Reliance on the army 
contributed to the empire’s eventual undoing – gener-
als and their armies competed for political power, the 
economy was undermined by overtaxation and other 
factors, and growing military weakness invited rebel-
lion, and invasion by ‘barbarians’.

1.6	 Pre-capitalist societies
It should be clear by now that pre-capitalist societies 
were by no means simple. They differed among them-
selves in all kinds of ways. At the same time, when com-
pared with present-day capitalist societies, they appear 
to have had a number of distinguishing features. This 
section will consider some of the more obvious ones.
Geographers and others have sometimes been tempted 
to think that past societies, lacking modern communica-
tions, were essentially small in scale and localized, with life 
based around the community. It is hoped that enough has 
been said already to suggest how over-simplified this view 
is. Huge empires had to be administered and defended, 
great cities like classical Rome had to be fed. Classical 
Rome imported some 17 million bushels of wheat each 
year from Egypt, North Africa and Sicily (Simmons 1996: 
109). In the Roman Empire and other societies, high-value 
goods often travelled much greater distances. Even the 
Inuit, living the lives of hunters and gatherers, sometimes 
travelled hundreds of miles each year on hunting trips, and 
their geographical knowledge frequently covered an even 
wider span. Enough has been said above about migrations 
and the diffusion of artefacts and practices across great 
distances to suggest how space could be overcome even if 
individuals were immobile, at least by today’s standards.
There was, however, no avoiding the problems of 
communication in pre-modern societies. Most people 
in agricultural societies lived lives which were bound to 
their villages and the surrounding regions. Their work 
consisted essentially in winning the means of subsist-
ence for themselves and their families from their environ-
ment, as well as paying the taxes and meeting the other 
demands which were made upon them. From the time of 
the appearance of states down until the twentieth cen-
tury the lives of most people were lived in the context of 
such peasant communities. As mentioned earlier, such 
communities are still characteristic of parts of the world 
today, though increasingly eroded by commercialism and 
growing contacts with modernity.
Scholars researching traditional peasant societies 
have frequently pointed to the many cultural differences 
between such rural dwellers and the cities that ruled over 
them and which they might occasionally visit. A case in 
point is religion. Religion has been a fundamental factor 
in social organization and in outlook in virtually every 
human society down to the twentieth century. Early states 
were generally associated with an official religion that 
legitimized the established order and which was often 
practised in cities but was rarely fully understood by the 
peasants, most of whom were probably illiterate (see 
Plate  1.5). Even where the peasants officially followed 
the same religion as the elite, as in medieval Europe, they 
almost always interpreted its teachings in their own ways, 
mixing them with their own superstitions and ‘pagan’ 
beliefs. The life and outlook of the ruler and the elite, if 
not of all cities, were entirely alien to them. And equally 
their way of life was alien to the cities.
For this reason, it would be completely misleading 
to think of the subjects of pre-capitalist states as ‘citi-
zens’ in the modern sense. Traditional rulers knew little 
of the countryside, where most of their subjects lived, 
and cared even less (except, perhaps, where they had 
landed estates, and even then the running of the estate 
could be left to officials). What mattered to rulers was 
law and order, and extracting the taxes and tribute the 
state needed to maintain itself in existence. The idea

impressed the peasants of

Middle East, even if they did 
not fully understand the icons’ 
significance.

international tourists and cultural visitors, whilst tourist 
providers and also those charged with the conservation of 
the past compete to sell the past to visitors. What cannot 
be viewed out of doors is gathered together into muse-
ums which become ever more elaborate and ever more 
tied to the leisure industry rather than to the educational 
role which defined them in the past. Cities which are in 
the business of selling themselves to international inves-
tors and global companies use their cultural resources, 
including heritage, to do so. Altogether, it seems, our age 
is obsessed with the past, and nostalgia has become part 
of almost everyone’s life.
Not surprisingly, perhaps, the present-day significance 
of heritage has not escaped the notice of human geogra-
phers and other students of society (Graham et al. 2000; 
Johnson 2003; Benton 2010). Geographers have been con-
cerned to know what it is about the past which appears 
to attract so much public interest and how people under-
stand those facets of the past which they encounter. More 
specifically, since the past is no longer with us and cannot 
be encountered directly, scholars have begun to ask about 
which particular past is being viewed under the guise of 
heritage, and about the ways in which the past is manipu-
lated for public consumption. For the fact is that there 
are many pasts, depending on the viewpoints of those 
who wish to describe them and on the messages which 
those in control of heritage wish to purvey. Whether it 
be politicians wishing to convey some lesson about ‘the 
nation’ (such as the recent discussion in the UK about so-
called ‘British values’), museum curators trying to explain 
particular historical events or epochs, or the guardians 
of historic sites aiming to entertain and titillate tourists, 
the scope for historical distortion (even if it means only 
telling one side of the story) is immense. History, in other 
words, is all around us, and history is controversial. Only 
by knowing something about the past can the geographer 
hope to avoid ignorance about the present.
that rulers should care for the welfare of their ordinary 
subjects, let alone consult them about their policies, is 
very modern indeed.
It is difficult for most people living in a world domi-
nated by capitalist relationships to conceive of societies 
where this was not the case. Before capitalism, most peo-
ple were engaged in subsistence activities: hunting, gath-
ering, farming, fishing or whatever. They might have to 
pay taxes or tribute, and they might trade some of what 
they gathered or produced, but market trade, generally 
organized by a small minority of merchants and traders, 
was often quite marginal to them. Where market trade 
did exist in early societies, it was frequently hedged about 
by laws and restrictions of various kinds. There might be 
laws against the taking of interest on loans, for exam-
ple, regulations on price, or restrictions on where and 
when trade might take place or who might engage in it. 
Only with the rise of modern capitalism did the market 
become central to the way societies functioned.
It is very difficult to generalize about pre-capital-
ist societies and almost any generalization is open to 
objection. Case study 1.2 describes the main features 
of the feudal society that existed in medieval Europe 
which, according to many scholars, was the seedbed for 
the development of world capitalism (see Chapter 2). 
Even here, however, one must be careful – the features 
described would be more or less true, depending on the 
date and the place being considered.
1.7	 The heritage of the past
Nowadays the past, or what is commonly referred to 
as heritage, is big business. Medieval cities and cathe-
drals, historic villages and battlefields, monuments, 
gardens and ruined temples are objects sought out by 
Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter, you should begin to appreci-
ate that:
● The surviving evidence necessarily limits our 
knowledge of past societies, since they cannot be 
observed directly. In general, the further back in 
time past societies existed, the more uncertain our 
knowledge about them becomes.
● People in the past lived very different lives from 
those of most people alive today. But it is important 
not to oversimplify or overgeneralize about past 
societies that varied enormously in their structures 
and ways of life and in their degree of complexity.
● Classifying societies into types is a way of making 
sense of the past and of trying to understand the 
geographical characteristics of varied societies. But 
all classifications have their shortcomings.
● Overcoming the friction of space was a severe prob-
lem in pre-capitalist societies. But it is important not 
to exaggerate its effects – people often travelled, and 
often migrated, long distances even in ‘primitive’ soci-
eties, ideas and artefacts travelled vast distances, 
and empires were successfully established.
● The landscapes that can be seen today have been 
profoundly influenced by past societies, including 
hunter-gatherer ones. Our world is the product of 
generations of human activity.

36    Section 1  Worlds in the Past: Changing Scales of Experience and Past Worlds in the Present
● Change and progress are two different things. 
Social change almost always means winners and 
losers. The human record suggests that the latter 
have often been the majority.
● We must not assume that our present-day society is 
the world’s most successful or progressive. We should 
be prepared to learn from others and to allow for the 
possibility that other ways of organizing society might 
be better at coping with some problems (for example, 
that of environmental degradation) than our own.
● There are many pasts depending on the viewpoint 
of the observer. Many assumptions adopted by 
people alive today are based on misunderstandings 
or distortions of the past. We should always be pre-
pared to test our ideas and assumptions against the 
historical evidence. We should be prepared to do 
the same with the ideas and assumptions of others.
● Only by knowing something about the past can the 
human geographer hope to avoid ignorance about 
the present.

B
etween 1500 and 1900 there was a fundamental 
change in the way an increasingly large part of the 
Western world was organized. Beginning in particular in 
parts of England, and spreading to other parts of Europe, 
the capitalist economic system was to change, or influ-
ence substantially, not only the economies, but also the 
political, social and cultural dimensions of newly power-
ful nation-states. By 1900, capitalism was the dominant 
socio-economic system over a large part of the world, a 
by-product of the colonial empires of those nation-states.
2.1	 What is capitalism?
A number of writers have provided theoretical frame-
works for understanding the workings and ramifica-
tions of the capitalist system. The first was devised by 
the Scottish philosopher, historian and father of classi-
cal economics, Adam Smith, in his book An Inquiry into 
the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). 
Like all theoretical models, Smith’s is a simplification of 
reality, but it introduced a terminology and series of con-
ceptualizations that are still familiar to us today. Smith 
assumed the model was driven by people’s selfish desires 
for gain and self-interest. Thus, production takes place to 
generate profit; surplus profits are accumulated as capi-
tal; and the basic rule of the system is ‘accumulate or per-
ish’. Integral to the system is the determination of prices 
which, in a free market, said Smith, are determined by the 
supply of, and demand for, the factors of production. In 
order to maximize their profits, industrialists will always 
seek to minimize their costs of production, including the 
wages that they pay their workforce, so as to outcom-
pete other producers by having lower prices. One way of 
doing this was through the division of labour, dividing 
manufacturing tasks into simple, repetitive operations 
that could be performed by unskilled, and therefore 
cheap, labour. Another important way in which manu-
facturers could seek competitive advantage over their 
fellows was to be first in the use of new technology. The 
significance of the invention and adoption of new ways 
of doing things, whether through science and technol-
ogy, or ideas and organization, has often been crucial to 
firms, industries and regions in getting ahead of com-
petitors. This is still very clearly so today in technologi-
cal ‘hotspots’ like the Milano and Stuttgart regions of 
the European space economy. Most scholars agree that 
the capitalist system began to cohere into an integrated 
whole in a particular place (England), at a particular time 
(the seventeenth century), and that it then took another 
long period (until the mid nineteenth century) before it 
matured in the states of north-west Europe and in North 
America (Green and Sutcliffe 1987: 6–7) ­(Spotlight 
box 2.1). We do need to note, however, that recently this 
viewpoint has been challenged by some historians who 
believe that it is too Eurocentric and that greater atten-
tion should be given to developments in China and the 
East more generally (Section 2.2.3).
2.1.1 Cyclical characteristics of economic  
development
Smith went on to model the workings of a national econ-
omy over a year (macroeconomics) to elucidate the way 
in which capitalism works in a series of interconnected 
cycles. These cycles have been studied subsequently by 
other economists, most notably the Russian N. Kondra-
tieff (1925), whose name is now used for the roughly

Characteristics of states with a mature 
capitalist economy and society
● The majority of the population in these countries were 
wage labourers forming a ‘working class’ who sold 
their labour power for wages in cash or kind so as to 
purchase food and other commodities to survive.
● The majority of these wage labourers were male 
and worked outside the home; females increasingly 
‘worked’ in the home, both in the domestic care of 
their families and by ‘selling’ surplus labour time for 
minimal wages.
● Wage labourers were increasingly closely super-
vised by managers of the production processes.
● The means of production of wage labourers was 
owned by capitalists whose aim was to make a 
profit on their investment.
● There was an increasing disparity between the 
‘profit’ of capitalists and the ‘wages’ of workers with 
an increasing propensity for conflict between the 
two.
● The vast majority of goods and services, including 
fixed property like land, were distributed through 
monetary exchange.

Chapter 2  The rise and spread of capitalism    39
provides a threefold categorization of historical socio-
economic systems. Wallerstein proceeded to delimit the 
spatial characteristics of the capitalist world economy 
into core, periphery and semi-periphery. These terms 
are not used in the everyday sense but signify areas in 
which particular processes operate. For Wallerstein, core 
processes are those characterized by relatively high wages, 
advanced technology and diversified production; periph-
ery processes are characterized by low wages, simple 
technology and limited production. Between the two is 
the semi-periphery: areas that exploit the periphery but 
which are exploited by the core, so that they exhibit a 
mixture of both core and peripheral processes (Taylor 
1989: 16–17). In the period between the seventeenth and 
the end of the nineteenth century some regions of the 
world were in the core (north-west Europe, for exam-
ple) or periphery (central Africa) throughout the period. 
Other regions moved from the semi-periphery into either 
the core (the southern states of the USA, for example) or 
the periphery (the states emerging from the ruins of the 
Ottoman/Turkish empire). Wallerstein’s theory has been 
very influential in explanations of the growth of globali-
zation, but it is an explanation only at the ‘structural’ 
level. It says little about the complexities of the social and 
economic networks that enable the system to work, or of 
the resistance by groups or individuals trying to change 
it (Ogborn 1999).
2.2.3 Eurocentrism
In recent decades, a significant  group of scholars (mostly 
historians) have claimed that most of the theories dis-
cussed above are ‘Eurocentric’. That is they tell the 
story of these three centuries as being about the ‘rise 
of the West’ owing to its developing humanism, scien-
tific rationalism and democratic politics. The story of 
the East is relegated to a few footnotes because it was 
perceived as passive, unchanging and despotic. This new 
group of scholars, beginning perhaps with Edward Said 
(1978) and his concept of ‘Orientalism’, have tried to 
show that, in fact, the story of East and West is funda-
mentally intertwined and that capitalism would not have 
emerged without the import of eastern technology, ideas 
and resources along long-established long-distance trade 
routes developed by eastern merchants and connecting 
to Europe through the Middle East. Eurocentrism was 
deeply embedded in the West (at least from medieval 
times onwards) and also led to a distinctive, socially con-
structed European ‘identity’ that was Christian and ‘civi-
lized’ and could be set against the so-called ‘primitive’ 
peoples of North America, Africa and Australasia who 
could be exploited as European states began to develop 
their empires (Hobson 2004).
50-year-long cycles of boom and depression that have 
characterized the capitalist world since the mid eight-
eenth century.
In seeking the explanation for these cycles of growth 
and stagnation, Schumpeter (1939) argued that technical 
innovation leading to the development of new industries 
was the key to understanding the growth phase of the 
cycle. Because technical innovation is spatially uneven, 
then so too has been the geography of economic devel-
opment under capitalism. The question then arises as 
to why the geography of innovation is uneven. Recent 
research has suggested that the socio-institutional struc-
tures of regions of innovation, or of those lacking innova-
tion, are the key to explanation; in other words, whether 
educational, governmental and social organizations 
encourage or discourage enterprise and change. Others 
have criticized the technological determinism of these 
theories (Mahon 1987).
2.2	 Other perspectives, other stories
2.2.1 Marxism
The viewpoints of orthodox economics are not the 
only interpretation of the transformation of large parts 
of the world over the past 300 years. Karl Marx, in his 
book Das Kapital (1867), took a very different perspec-
tive in his analysis of capitalism (see Spotlight box 3.2). 
He proposed that profit arises out of the way in which 
capitalists (the bourgeoisie) dominate labour (the work-
ers) in an unequal class-based relationship. This unequal 
class relationship was perceived by Marx to lead inevita-
bly to class conflict. In his later writing he sketched out 
ways in which labour could gain control of the means 
of production and thereby ‘throw off their chains’. This 
was to have dramatic long-term consequences for the 
socio-political organization of the world through most 
of the twentieth century between the Russian Revolu-
tion and the upheavals of 1989 (see Chapter 3, pp. 65–7). 
We need to note, however, that Marx’s writing is domi-
nated by an historical, but not a geographical, perspec-
tive: it traces class relationships in time but not in space. 
Marxist interpretations of capitalist development have 
therefore always had difficulty in conceptualizing uneven 
spatial development. It is also highly Eurocentric in its 
perspective.
2.2.2 World systems theory
Another way of conceptualizing the nature of these 
changes is to be found in the writings of Immanuel 
Wallerstein (1979), whose ‘world-systems theory’ 

40    Section 1  Worlds in the Past: Changing Scales of Experience and Past Worlds in the Present
By the later fifteenth century, larger European towns 
were dominated by what has come to be called mer-
chant capitalism. Merchants were both the providers 
of capital and principal traders in a regionally special-
ized, complex, Europe-wide trading nexus based not on 
luxury goods as in the medieval period, but on bulky 
staples like grain and timber, and on an increasing array 
of manufactured products. Towns that flourished eco-
nomically in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Europe 
were those whose inhabitants were able to copy and 
manufacture imported products more cheaply than the 
exporting regions, and develop a constant stream of 
new, innovative, marketable products (Knox and Agnew 
1994: 154–61) (Spotlight box 2.2). For most commenta-
tors, the key question then becomes: why did these pro-
cesses of transformation coalesce first in sixteenth- and 
seventeenth-century England?
We can begin to answer this question by suggesting 
that, since land was one of the key factors of produc-
tion, critical in the sixteenth century was the enormous 
transfer of land in England from conservative ecclesi-
astical ownership to secular ownership. This was the 
consequence of the dissolution of the monasteries 
by Henry VIII in the later 1530s. Even the monastic 
buildings could be adapted by capitalist manufactur-
ers, as the Wiltshire clothier William Stumpe showed at 
Malmesbury Abbey where he installed 300 weavers in 
the 1540s (Chandler 1993: 487–9). Land was also being 
transformed in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries 
2.3	
The transition from feudalism  
to capitalism
The transformation of the European economy into a cap-
italist one was a long drawn-out process and historians 
continue to argue the precise causes of the changes that 
took place. Writers using an avowedly Marxist frame of 
reference (Dobb 1946; Kaye 1984) have made many of the 
most significant contributions in this debate. To them, 
the development of a class of wage labourers is crucial, 
together with the assumption of political power by the 
new class of capitalists. Geographers have been particu-
larly concerned to trace the outworking of these histori-
cal processes of social and economic transformation in 
the particular space economies of local regions (Gregory 
1982; Langton 1984; Stobart and Raven 2004).
The disintegration of feudalism (see Case study 1.2), 
with its carefully controlled market system, was consid-
erably speeded by the after-effects of the Black Death in 
mid-fourteenth-century Europe. The European popula-
tion was reduced by between one-third and a half, and 
towns were especially hard hit. The resulting labour 
shortage meant that enterprise and new ways of doing 
things were more likely to be rewarded, since the feudal 
elite required more revenue to maintain their power. At 
the same time, the slackening of social and cultural con-
trols meant that new ways of thinking could flourish, 
especially in the growing towns.
Spotlight box 2.2
Characteristics of the period of merchant 
capitalism in Europe
● Increasing numbers of people sold their labour for 
money wages. They ceased to work on their own 
land. This led to increased consumer demand for 
food, clothing and household goods; in many places 
there was a notable rise in living standards.
● More producers of both agricultural and craft-man-
ufactured products began to accumulate capital as 
they produced for this growing market. These pros-
perous yeoman farmers and manufacturers were 
the foundation of a new class of capitalists.
● The removal of feudal market restrictions and controls 
by guilds on production led merchants to invest in the 
reorganization of production on a capitalist basis.
● Technical innovations transformed industries; the 
most significant was probably the development of 
the printing press by Gutenberg, in Mainz, ena-
bling knowledge to be diffused cheaply and rapidly. 
However, we need to note that paper-making, block 
printing, and the movable metal-type press all origi-
nated earlier in China/Korea.
● The rediscovery of Classical knowledge led to new 
ways of seeing the world and, consequently, to its 
rebuilding to reflect these new images, especially in 
towns.
● Ultimately, these changes led to religious upheaval 
and political revolution whereby the new capital-
ist class became dominant in the governance of 
nation-states.

Chapter 2  The rise and spread of capitalism    41
and this period is known as the ‘Age of Absolutism’. 
Landowners, especially the rulers of small states, amassed 
enormous wealth from their control of land. This wealth 
was expended on increasingly spectacular landscapes of 
display: huge palaces, filled with works of art and every 
luxury, set in carefully designed, and often very intricate, 
landscapes reliant on vast inputs of labour for their main-
tenance (Figure 2.1). King Louis XIV of France had set 
the model at his palace of Versailles, outside Paris, using 
the resources of a much larger state. Such conspicuous 
displays of wealth and privilege by the few led, ulti-
mately, to a much bloodier revolution than in England. 
The French Revolution saw the slaughter of not simply 
the royal house, but of the landowners, intellectuals and 
the bourgeoisie, since this was the first of the workers’ 
revolutions, with its cry of ‘Liberté, egalité, fraternité’. 
However, it led rapidly to the totalitarian militarism of 
Napoleon.
through the process of enclosure. This enabled live-
stock to be raised more efficiently for the urban meat  
markets and experimentation in new agricultural tech-
niques to be undertaken by yeoman farmers (Butlin 
1993: 178–9).
In the seventeenth century it was the social, religious 
and political transformation of England that was critical, 
according to Dobb (1946). The struggles between Crown 
and Parliament during the Civil War and Commonwealth 
(1642–60) are seen as a conflict between landowners, 
and capitalist yeomen and manufacturers. Though this 
struggle was continued through the Restoration (1660) 
and Glorious Revolution (1688), by the end of the seven-
teenth century the capitalist bourgeoisie were politically 
predominant and were able to transform the state to their 
own advantage.
Elsewhere in Europe landowners remained pre-emi-
nent over a predominantly peasant agricultural workforce

of the European colonial empires that were to dominate 
and control almost every aspect of life for the next 400 
years. The Portuguese established a far-flung network of 
small fortified port bases around Africa and the Indian 
Ocean, many of them based beside existing Arab ports, 
through which they were able to link western Europe into 
the trade in gold, spices and textiles (Figure 2.2). Equally 
significant was their use of African slaves to produce 
sugar on plantation farms in their Brazilian territory. 
The Spanish founded a more militaristic, oppressive and 
exploitative empire in central and south America which 
saw the decimation of local populations through war-
fare and the catastrophic effects of European diseases, 
especially smallpox and measles. It also brought enor-
mous inflows of gold and silver bullion into Spain and, 
ultimately, onwards into the European economy. Blaut 
(1993) sees this as the event that more than any other 
kick-started the European capitalist world system.
Fairly quickly, control of the products of this new 
Western maritime world economy moved from south-
west to north-west Europe. The Dutch began to compete 
successfully with the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean and 
the centres of European capital moved from Lisbon and 
Seville first to Antwerp by the mid sixteenth century, and 
then to Amsterdam at the end of the century. The mer-
chants of these ports successfully integrated the Atlantic 
trade with that flowing from the Baltic and from central 
2.4	 An expanding world
As the European economic and cultural world was grad-
ually transformed, European travellers began to voyage 
beyond the shores of Europe. They travelled overland 
into Asia, drawn both by a thirst for greater knowl-
edge and, more significantly, by the rewards that could 
be reaped from direct exploitation of scarce commodi-
ties for European consumption. These included spices, 
sugar, silk, muslins, porcelain and the like, which had 
previously been traded through the eastern Mediterra-
nean. In the late fifteenth century, however, this region 
was coming under Turkish (Ottoman) control. The Por-
tuguese, funded by Italian bankers, were the first Euro-
peans to navigate round Africa into the Indian Ocean, 
using the existing Arab-dominated sea-based trading 
networks (Arabs had already rounded the Cape in the 
other direction), whilst soon after (in 1492), Christopher 
Columbus, again funded by Italian (Genoese) merchant 
capital, sailed westwards across the Atlantic to open the 
Americas to European exploitation using African labour.
For Spain and Portugal, this is the heroic ‘Age of the 
Navigators’, as they moved rapidly to take control of 
these new maritime trade routes looking out to the Atlan-
tic. The merchants of Lisbon and Seville grew rich on this 
trade. For the rest of the world it marks the beginning

capitalist system moved once more, from Amsterdam to 
London (Dodgshon 1998).
The colonialist trading systems that developed in the 
period up to 1770 have often been described in simple 
dualist, oppositional, terms (core–periphery; dominant–
subordinate; metropolitan–colonial, for example). Blaut 
(1993) is especially critical of the Eurocentric character 
of this type of argument. More recently, a more com-
plex, multi-layered interpretation has been posited. We 
need to note, first, that different parts of the developing 
world economy operated in somewhat different ways, 
were based on different product interactions between raw 
materials, manufacture and consumption, involved com-
plex transportation flows, and required different politico-
military frameworks to make them function properly. 
Meinig’s (1986) model of the Anglo-French mid-eight-
eenth-century North Atlantic economy uncovers some of 
these complexities in terms of the commercial, political 
and social systems that were required for the geography of 
colonial capitalism, and Ogborn (1999) has added details 
of networks of individuals and patterns of resistance  
(Figure 2.3). The North Atlantic ‘triangular trade’ is cer-
tainly the best-known of these colonial trading systems.
Europe via the Rhine valley. It was at Antwerp that the 
first stock exchange was established, enabling capital 
raised in one business to fund investment in another. 
Amsterdam’s rise was based on having greater military 
and naval power than its neighbours and using it to 
enforce the privileges of a distinctive trading monopoly: 
the state-licensed joint-stock charter company (the Dutch 
East India Company) (Dodgshon 1998: 74–83).
At the same time, French and English fishermen 
had followed John Cabot’s exploratory voyage across 
the North Atlantic to begin to exploit the rich fishing 
grounds off Newfoundland and, subsequently, to trade 
with native Americans for fur pelts. From these small 
beginnings French and English merchant influence began 
to expand through the seventeenth century in the Indian 
Ocean (using similar company trading monopolies to the 
Dutch); in the Caribbean, where sugar plantations and 
slave labour were copied from the Portuguese; and in 
North America. They superseded the Dutch in the early 
eighteenth century through superiority of arms, but it 
was not until the later eighteenth century that the Brit-
ish emerged dominant in the developing Western world 
economy. Consequently the primary city of the European

frontier a barter system of exchange was as likely to 
be found as a money economy. Nonetheless, fur, fish, 
timber and agricultural produce flowed in the opposite 
direction for storage and transhipment back to Europe 
(see Figure 2.3).
In North America, tobacco, rice, sugar, rum and cot-
ton were the major export products. All were produced 
on the plantation system using slave labour. By 1750, 
some 50,000-60,000 people were being forcibly trans-
ported across the Atlantic each year from all parts of 
the western African seaboard. Many died en route or 
shortly afterwards but, altogether, some 3.8 million 
Africans had been transported by 1750, just over half 
to Latin America, the remainder to English, French 
and Dutch North America and the West Indies. These 
2.4.1 Colonial commerce
In Meinig’s North Atlantic commercial system, London 
and Paris acted as the source of finance, commercial 
intelligence and marketing (London’s Royal Exchange 
was founded in 1566). The expanding industries of par-
ticular regions of western Europe were growing, in part 
because they supplied a developing colonial market with 
manufactured goods such as textiles, tools, armaments 
and household necessities. These goods were assem-
bled in Atlantic ports such as Bristol, Liverpool, Bor-
deaux and Le Havre. After crossing the Atlantic they 
were stored, disassembled and distributed from colonial 
ports such as New York, Charleston and New Orleans 
(Figure 2.4, Plate  2.1) by major traders. They sold on 
to local traders towards the colonial frontier. At the

would sail first to African trading stations to exchange 
manufactured products, including guns, tools and chains, 
for slaves. The slaves would then be taken to the West 
Indies or Charleston, with ships returning to Liverpool 
or Bristol with a cargo of sugar, tobacco, rum or rice, 
and sometimes slaves such as Equiano, too. Most of the 
latter were destined for domestic service in aristocratic 
households (see Figure 2.3).
2.4.2 Colonial society
The slave trade was perhaps the most significant aspect 
of the cultural transformation effected by the eight-
eenth-century capitalist world economy in the Ameri-
cas and, it should not be forgotten, in Africa. One of 
the distinctive features of this transformation in the 
Americas was the ‘othering’ of Africans by Europeans. 
They were regarded as in every way inferior to Euro-
peans; they were legally and socially defined as differ-
ent; and they therefore lived their lives separately from 
white settlers. The social consequences of this were to 
reverberate through the next 250 years, into our own 
times, where spatially segregated city neighbourhoods 
based on ethnicity are still a commonplace in North 
American cities, whilst from the 1950s West Indian 
staggering figures meant that African-Americans were 
easily the largest new culture group to be established in 
both North and South America in the colonial period 
(Meinig 1986: 226–31).
The African abolitionist Olaudah Equiano, who 
gained his freedom in England, wrote forcefully from 
his own experience about the horrors of the ‘middle 
passage’ voyage from West Africa to the West Indies. 
He said:
The stench of the hold while we were on the coast was 
intolerably loathsome ... but now that the whole ship’s 
cargo were confined together, it became absolutely 
pestilential ... The air soon became unfit for respira-
tion... and brought on a sickness among the slaves, 
of which many died ... This wretched situation was 
aggravated by the galling of the chains ... and the filth 
of the necessary tubs (toilets) into which the children 
often fell and were almost suffocated. The shrieks of 
the women and the groans of the dying, rendered the 
whole scene of horror almost inconceivable.
(1789)
By 1750, the trade in slaves was dominated by large 
European companies using specially constructed and fit-
ted ships, but many smaller traders from the Atlantic ports

their dedicatory saints gave name to many of today’s 
largest cities: San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, 
for example (Conzen 1990).
By the beginning of the eighteenth century, signifi-
cant migrations of Scots, Irish, French, Germans, Dutch, 
Swiss and Moravians had taken place, but the dominant 
migrant group were the English. Between 1700 and 1775 
the population of the eastern colonies grew tenfold to 
some 2.5 million and, by 1820, the population of the 
United States surpassed that of Britain (Lemon 1987: 
121). The losers were native Americans who were dispos-
sessed of their lands east of the Appalachians and often 
taken into slavery.
2.4.3 Colonial politics
There were major differences in the way European states 
governed their colonial empires. The Spanish devel-
oped a highly centralized system in which all aspects 
of policy were laid down in Madrid. The Laws of the 
Indies, which laid down in meticulous detail how colo-
nization should take place and how new towns should 
be planned, are symptomatic of this centralization 
(Nostrand 1987) (Case study 2.1). The French governed 
through a similar centralized structure of military, 
migration to Britain saw similar ethnic areas develop in 
many British cities. Where Africans were in the major-
ity in the eighteenth-century colonies, as they were in 
the West Indies, and in the Carolinas and Louisiana, 
this enabled distinctive African-American cultures to 
develop within the confines of political and economic 
enslavement.
There were, of course, other trans-Atlantic migra-
tions throughout the time period covered in this chapter. 
The earliest included those seeking to escape religious 
persecution in Europe, or to establish religious utopias 
in the new continent. The Puritan ‘Founding Fathers’ of 
New England were in this category and, right through 
to the Mormon migration in the early nineteenth cen-
tury, such groups continued to leave Europe’s shores for 
what was perceived to be a better new world. Religious 
faith also inspired another group of settlers who came 
to convert the native people of the Americas to Christi-
anity. The competition in Europe between Catholic and 
Protestant versions of the faith – between Reformation 
and Counter-Reformation – was exported to the colo-
nies since both native Americans and African slaves were 
perceived as being in need of conversion. Consequently, 
Jesuit monasteries or Franciscan friaries often stand at 
the heart of Spanish colonial towns and cities, whilst

1807, and then to slavery in 1833. Sadly, the invective of 
both populist and bourgeois writing opposed to abo-
lition characterized Africans, Australian Aborigines, 
Indians and native Americans as not only unchristian 
and therefore ‘uncivilized’ but also as less than human; 
inferior to Europeans in every way; both savage and yet 
child-like, and therefore needing to be controlled and 
disciplined. By the middle of the nineteenth century, 
these attitudes were widespread amongst all classes in 
Britain and were fuelled further by popular antagonism 
to events such as the Indian Mutiny (1857), the Zulu 
rebellion (1879) and the Maori wars (1860s). By the late 
nineteenth century, Darwin’s ideas on evolution were 
being misused to give a scientific veneer of respectabil-
ity to this ‘othering’ of non-Europeans, to the extent 
that Australian Aborigines were being shot as ‘vermin’ 
rather than seen as fellow humans.
In the United States the institution of slavery 
­continued to flourish, especially in the lower Missis-
sippi ­valley where it was an essential part of the cotton-
growing plantation economy. In 1800 there were some 
100,000 slaves in the present states of Louisiana and 
Mississippi; by 1860 there were more than 750,000. 
The slave trade had been successfully internalized 
and American firms with jails and large yards walked 
slaves from the south-eastern states to the Mississippi, 
bred children for sale and, as the recent film 12 Years 
a Slave (2013), based on the 1853 autobiography of 
Solomon Northup, so graphically showed, kidnapped 
men, women and children from freedom into slavery 
(Johnson 2013).
The mid nineteenth century marked both the deliver-
ance of one continent from colonialism to self-govern-
ment, as South America broke free from Spanish and 
Portuguese control, and the colonizing of another, as 
European powers raced to divide Africa amongst them-
selves. The interior of Africa remained largely unknown 
to Europeans until the 1860s except for Christian mis-
sionaries. But by the end of the century, borders had 
been delineated and fought over, natural resources were 
being rapaciously exploited, and the polities, cultures 
and economies of native peoples had been disrupted 
or destroyed (Figure 2.5). Again, this period of history 
reverberates down to the beginning of the twenty-first 
century because the boundaries drawn to the satisfac-
tion of European soldiers, administrators and traders 
did not correspond to African ethnic, cultural and polit-
ical divisions. In some respects the origins of the geno-
cides of Biafra (1960s’ Nigeria) and Rwanda (1990s), 
and the long civil war in Sudan, which is still ongoing 
in Darfur and South Sudan, can be laid at the door of 
the ‘scramble for Africa’ in the later nineteenth century.
administrative and ecclesiastical strands of authority 
linked to government departments and the Crown in 
Paris. The English, in contrast, allowed each colony to 
be virtually self-governing and the links to London were 
many and various. English colonial plantation owners 
and merchants were not averse to threatening a gover-
nor if their capitalist trading relations were endangered. 
It should occasion no surprise that it was the English 
colonies that eventually first rebelled and fought for 
their independence. Overlapping these colonial territo-
ries were the older territorial patterns of native group-
ings, those of the Iroquois and Creeks remaining well 
into the eighteenth century (Meinig 1986: 262). That 
was to change dramatically after 1815 when, over the 
next 15 years, the south-eastern United States was ‘eth-
nically cleansed’ of its native American inhabitants. 
The resultant land sales of millions of acres of 160-acre 
‘quarter sections’ saw the first great economic boom in 
the United States, in much the same way as the sale of 
monastic lands had done in Britain in the mid sixteenth 
century (Johnson 2013).
2.5	 Imperialism and racism
A second phase of colonial expansion, through the 
nineteenth century, was geographically distinct in that 
it was focused on Asia and, especially after 1880, on 
Africa. It is also marked by the development of a much 
more virulent racism in the ‘othering’ of all non-Euro-
peans. The consolidation of European states in the 
nineteenth century, especially of Germany and Italy, 
and the increasing economic competition they offered 
to the eighteenth-century leaders of the world economy, 
Britain and France, led them to seek new opportunities 
through the colonial exploitation of hitherto economi-
cally peripheral lands. Britain seized the Dutch Cape 
Colony at the tip of southern Africa in 1806 to prevent 
its use by Napoleon’s navy. By 1820, 4,000 British set-
tler graziers were in conflict with African pastoralists, 
despite the fact that the low-wage labour of those same 
Africans was essential to maintain the farms (Lester 
1999). At much the same time, the first British farmers 
were beginning to establish themselves in Australia as its 
period as a convict colony began to draw to a close. The 
recent novel by Kate Grenville, The Secret River (2006), 
gives a perceptive, imaginative account of the struggle 
for land between farmers and Aborigines at this time 
and the consequences for both cultures of that struggle. 
Meanwhile, in Britain itself, Christian-inspired reform-
ers succeeded in bringing an end to the slave trade in

homes. These producers generally worked in family 
units and were paid piece rates on a weekly or monthly 
basis. Their ‘time geography’ was therefore under their 
own control. As long as the contracted number of items 
were made each week then recreation or other activities 
could be fitted into the week. Many early industrial pro-
cesses were located in the countryside to avoid problems 
with urban guild restrictions and to enable machinery 
to be water-powered.
Textile manufacture is the most studied production 
process of this period. Its transformation began in sev-
eral parts of Europe as early as the fifteenth century. 
By the early eighteenth century, more and more of the 
production processes were being mechanized and indus-
trialists were concentrating their machinery into single, 
2.6	 Industrialization
2.6.1 Proto-industrialization
The early phases of capitalist industrial development 
in Europe, up to about 1770, are categorized in vari-
ous ways. To some writers this is the period of mer-
chant capitalism (see Spotlight box 2.2), to others this 
is the period of proto-industrialization. Both terms 
have generated a substantive academic debate as to pre-
cisely what processes of transformation were involved. 
Proto-industrialization is characterized by some type 
of ‘domestic’ production system whereby the capital-
ist merchant provides the raw materials and often the 
machinery for producers who worked in their own

(Hannah Brown, interviewed in 1832).
Legislation dating from this time remains effective in 
controlling the age at which children and young people 
can work and their hours of employment.
The complex interaction of resources, labour skills, 
technological innovation, and capital circulation in par-
ticular regional economies, which increased production 
and lowered prices, meant that new markets had to be 
developed and transport improved. Market opportuni-
ties were to be found both in the growing urban markets 
at home, and among the colonial populations overseas. 
Thus, cotton textiles were first imported to Britain from 
multi-floor buildings. By the 1770s, the mechanization of 
spinning had been completed and weaving followed in the 
1820s. The logic of this transformation was completed 
by steam power and the factory was established as both 
a building (Figure 2.6) and a system of production (Spot-
light box 2.3). Different sectors of the textile industry 
went through this transformation at different times, and 
some sectors declined absolutely as capital was diverted 
to the most prosperous sectors. The textile industry, more 
than any other, had a relentless tendency to geographi-
cal specialization and concentration with the result that 
many towns and regions were dangerously dependent on 
a single industry (Laxton 1986). By the 1770s in Britain, 
west Yorkshire was beginning to dominate light worsted 
woollen cloth, Lancashire and the north Midlands cotton 
cloth production, the Welsh borders flannel, and the east 
Midlands hosiery.
Figure 2.6  Starkey’s woollen textile mill, Huddersfield, c.1850. Though this mill was steam-powered, by mid-
century its powerlooms were still housed in multi-storey buildings rather than a single-storey shed, since the site 
was a restricted one.

The factory system of production
Under the factory system the capitalist:
● Had complete control of the production process 
from receipt of raw materials to finished product.
● Had control of the labour force on whom a new, 
disciplined time geography could be imposed (early 
factories often worked day and night).
● Could apply capital to the development of new 
machinery to simplify processes and reduce labour 
costs through mechanization; and,
● By dividing the tasks of the production process, 
could reduce labour costs further by employing 
women and children.

50    Section 1  Worlds in the Past: Changing Scales of Experience and Past Worlds in the Present
(jewellery and silver plate), as well as the Duke of Bridge-
water (landowner and coal owner), all invested some of 
their capital in canal companies to improve the distribu-
tion of their products (Freeman 1986). A similar pattern 
is observed in New England. In France and Germany, by 
contrast, new roads were seen to have a military function 
in the centralization of state control and were therefore 
largely financed by the state through taxation.
2.6.2 Agricultural change
It was not just industries such as textiles, metal manu-
facturing and pottery that were transformed by early 
capitalist production: society needed food production to 
keep pace with a rising population that was increasingly 
employed full-time in manufacturing. Consequently, 
the eighteenth century saw the transformation of agri-
culture into increasingly capitalistic modes. In parts of 
Europe, especially in Britain, self-sufficient peasant farm-
ing began to come under pressure from landowners who 
used state legislation to remove common rights to land in 
India; the techniques of production were learnt; manu-
facture commenced; factory production lowered costs; 
cotton textiles were exported to India; there they under-
cut and destroyed the Indian industry.
A key transformation of the transport infrastructure, 
so essential to industrialization, was the improvement of 
links with growing towns, and with the ports. Canals and 
turnpike (toll) roads, which were the principal innova-
tions before the 1820s, also lowered the costs of raw mate-
rials, especially of coal. This is graphically illustrated by 
the way in which urban populations celebrated the open-
ing of new canals, not for their industrial potential, but 
because they dramatically reduced the cost of domestic 
heating. In Britain, the construction of better roads, and 
of the canal network, mostly between 1760 and 1815 
(the growth phase of the first Kondratieff cycle) was 
financed by private capital. The state was involved only 
in providing the necessary legislation to enable construc-
tion to take place and fees or tolls to be levied. Thus 
Josiah Wedgwood (china and pottery), Abraham Darby 
(iron manufacturer) (Figure 2.7) and Matthew Boulton 
Figure 2.7  The world’s first iron bridge, constructed across the River Severn, east Shropshire, in 1788 by

Chapter 2  The rise and spread of capitalism    51
favour of private ownership through enclosure. Owner-
ship was increasingly concentrated into fewer hands, and 
farms were consolidated from scattered strips to single-
block holdings, again especially in Britain and, rather 
later, in Scandinavia and northern Germany. Elsewhere 
in Europe this process was delayed until the twentieth 
century. In northern and western Europe, landowners 
invested in transforming production for the new urban 
markets, using technology and new techniques and crops 
first developed in the Low Countries in the seventeenth 
century. In eastern Europe, the semi-periphery, this period 
saw a reversion to serfdom and near-feudal relations 
of production. Capital was also deployed to increase 
the area of land under intensive, rather than extensive, 
production. Fenland and coastal marshes were drained; 
heathland soils improved for cultivation, and the moor-
land edge of improved pastures pushed higher up hill and 
mountain slopes.
In the nineteenth century, European agriculture con-
tinued to increase production but was unable to keep 
pace with the demand from the growing urban industrial 
population. In 1840, Britain repealed the Corn Laws, 
which had protected local grain producers, and opened 
its markets to colonial and American producers. New 
methods of extensive grain farming were used in mid-
western North America, and in the new British colonies 
in Australasia and South Africa. The invention of the 
steam ship, allowing more rapid transport, and of refrig-
eration and meat canning from the 1870s, led to similarly 
extensive ranch grazing of sheep and cattle in these coun-
tries. Together with the Pampas grasslands of Argentina, 
all became an important part of the semi-periphery of 
Britain’s global economy. This export-dominated agri-
culture was reliant on overseas investment by British capi-
tal in new railway networks to transport these products 
to slaughterhouses and industrial packing plants at the 
port cities whilst, in the USA, Chicago was growing rap-
idly on the same economic foundations (Cronon 1991; 
Miller 1997). It was accompanied, too, by new waves of 
migration to the colonies and the mid-west of the USA 
(Table 2.1), especially from Ireland and Scotland, where 
the Great Famine and the Highland Clearances, respec-
tively, were other manifestations of capitalist agricultural 
change in the British Isles. The United States absorbed 
enormous numbers of European migrants throughout the 
nineteenth century. Irish migrants predominated in the 
1840s and 1850s, followed by Scots and English, Scan-
dinavians and Germans through the second half of the 
century, with Russians, Italians and south-central Euro-
peans from the 1880s onwards (Table 2.1) (Ward 1987).
This later colonization, and the internal coloniza-
tion of the United States mid-west in particular, were 
grandly characterized as a moving frontier of settlement 
by the American historian, F.J. Turner, writing in 1894, 
who suggested that it also transformed the ‘character’ 
of frontier settlers, making them self-reliant, opportun-
istic, individualistic and democratic. Recent commen-
tators have noted that Turner’s hypothesis says little 
about the continued sweeping aside of the rights of the 
native populations of these lands who fought a long 
and ultimately unsuccessful attritional battle to retain 
it for their own use (the land was regarded as ‘open’ or

‘free’ for white settlement); nor does it give any credit 
for the settlement process to women, who provided both 
the domestic labour and, often, especially in the initial 
phase of settlement, much of the farm labour too. The 
advancing frontier of capitalist agriculture was as much 
small-scale, incremental and domestic as it was wide-
sweeping and large-scale.
2.6.3 Factories and industrial production
Some commentators have seen the ‘Industrial Revo-
lution’ in Britain as a short period, between 1770 and 
1830, of rapid transformation whereby the country’s 
economy moved from an agricultural to an industrial 
manufacturing basis. More recent writers see the trans-
formation as much more drawn out, extending from the 
seventeenth century and into the early twentieth century. 
They also see it as much more regionally diversified and 
geographically uneven, with particular regions special-
izing in particular products which transformed their 
production systems at different times. Most attention 
has been given to the textile and iron and steel indus-
tries, both of which are characterized by large factories 
requiring massive capital investment in buildings and 
machinery, driven by steam power, with manufacturing 
processes increasingly vertically integrated, and employ-
ing a large, and increasingly disciplined labour force 
(see Figure 2.6). The same forces were at work in New 
England. By 1855, there were 52 cotton mills in Lowell, 
Massachusetts, employing more than 13,000 people, 
two-thirds of them women (Groves 1987). In Europe, 
Lille (France), Ghent (Belgium), Lódź (Poland) and the 
Wupper valley of Germany developed as centres of cot-
ton textile manufacture (Pounds 1990: 402).
Recently, Johnson (2013), in an avowedly Marx-
ist interpretation, has suggested that historians have 
viewed the cotton trade (the largest single sector of the 
global economy in the first half of the nineteenth cen-
tury) through the wrong end of the telescope. It was 
not Lowell, Liverpool and Lódź that were the founda-
tion stones of the capitalist economy, but the Missis-
sippi valley, where the raw cotton was produced, where 
the planter’s capital was human bodies (slaves) which 
were more valuable than all the machinery, infrastruc-
ture, manufacturing and free labour elsewhere in the 
United States. The ‘industry’ of slave-based plantation 
cotton production in the Mississippi valley was what 
tied together the fortunes of cotton planters of Loui-
siana, the cotton brokers of Liverpool and the cotton 
manufacturers in Manchester. What kept the slaves 
from revolt and crushed slave resistance was the use of 
the state’s military might to ensure that the system was 
maintained (Johnson 2013).
Many other industries were developed in the same 
way as new markets arose on a national and interna-
tional basis and production expanded. Food and drink, 
for example, is rarely thought of as a factory-based 
industry, but brewing, once the prerogative of almost 
every village inn, became increasingly an urban, large-
scale industry with regional markets for its beers. In 
England, Burton-upon-Trent developed rapidly as the 
‘brewing capital’ of Britain, with huge factory-scale 
breweries, on the basis of its colonial contracts to sup-
ply bottled ‘India Pale Ale’ to troops and civilians sta-
tioned in the Indian sub-continent as a substitute for 
local water. For other industries, however, including 
many manufacturing industries, ‘factories’ remained 
small-scale workshops employing fewer than 50 people 
(the Sheffield cutlery industry in northern England, and 
wire-drawing in the eastern Ruhr in Germany are good 
examples). Indeed, many industries remained almost 
domestic in scale well into the twentieth century (for 
example, the Birmingham jewellery and Coventry watch 
industries, both in central England).
The nineteenth century is characterized not only by 
this enormous variety in the scale of production, but 
also by an equally enormous variety of manufactured 
products. The tag ‘The Workshop of the World’ is as 
true of nineteenth-century Britain in general as it is of 
several of the country’s manufacturing cities. In other 
British, European and American regions there was an 
increasing specialization so that local economies were 
dependent on maintaining market advantage on a sin-
gle industry: the Polish textile city of Lódź and Lanca-
shire’s cotton mill towns were of this kind. Such places 
also produced distinctive working-class cultures, which, 
in the case of Lódź, was also predominantly Jewish 
(Koter 1990). Again, in those same mill towns much 
factory employment was female (see the example of 
Lowell above), whereas in heavy industry centres, such 
as ship-building in Newcastle and Sunderland, in the 
north-east of England, waged employment was male-
dominated and women’s roles were primarily domes-
tic. E.P. Thompson, in his classic Marxist interpretation 
of The Making of  the English Working Class (1963), 
is especially sensitive to the variety of experiences of 
working people in this period of aggressive industrial 
capitalism. There are, however, some common features 
of nineteenth-century industrial development in Brit-
ain and, subsequently, in Europe and North America. 
First was the fact that the power supply for the major-
ity of industries came to be dominated by steam. There 
was therefore a move by many industries to the coal-
field regions to reduce the cost of fuel (Figure 2.8). The 
development of the Ruhr region of Germany (Pounds 
1990: 412–29), and of western Pennsylvania in the USA 

Chapter 2  The rise and spread of capitalism    53
(Meyer 1990: 256–8), are good examples of this process. 
The reason for this change in fuel supply was the inven-
tion and commercial development of the rotative steam 
engine by James Watt and Matthew Boulton in 1769–75.
Secondly this, in its turn, was fundamental to the 
invention and development of railways that transformed 
the transport costs of both raw materials and finished 
products almost as dramatically as it reduced the fric-
tion of distance. The Western and, increasingly, the 
colonial worlds saw a new time geography from the 
1840s onwards, whereby journeys previously requiring 
several days to accomplish could be undertaken in a few 
Figure 2.8  The coalfields of north-west Europe saw a concentration of new industrial enterprises after the 
1780s as steam-powered machinery became normal in textile manufacturing, iron and steel making and metal 
goods manufacturing.

54    Section 1  Worlds in the Past: Changing Scales of Experience and Past Worlds in the Present
hours. This was especially important in the industriali-
zation of North America with its vast transcontinental 
distances (the first transcontinental line was completed 
in 1869). It was also significant in Britain’s imperial 
control of India, and of Russia’s colonization of the 
interior of Siberia and central Asia. In all three cases the 
railways enabled industrial-scale exploitation of natu-
ral resources (from timber to metalliferous ores) to take 
place, the profits from which could, in turn, be invested 
in further industrial, urban or railway development. The 
rapid expansion of San Francisco following the Califor-
nia gold and Nevada silver discoveries in 1849 and 1859 
respectively is a good example of this (Walker 1996). 
Railways were also major industries in their own right, 
of course; the Indian railways employed three-quarters 
of a million people by the 1920s, for example.
Third was the fact that, as capitalists sought econo-
mies of scale, the transformations of the nineteenth 
century were largely urban. By 1851, Britain had become 
the first country anywhere in which a majority of its 
inhabitants lived and worked in towns. By 1900 there 
were sixteen cities in the world with a population that 
exceeded one million, as against one (Peking [Beijing]) 
in 1800, and another 27 places which had half a million 
or more (Lawton 1989).
2.7	 Urbanization
The urbanization of capital has been theorized from a 
Marxist perspective by Harvey (1985a, 1985b). He notes 
that, as capitalists over-accumulate, the surplus flows into 
secondary circuits of capital, of which the principal is the 
built environment (in its widest sense). As in the primary 
industrial circuit, these flows are cyclical according to the 
perceived profitability of such investment. Because of the 
longevity of the built environment these ‘building cycles’ 
(sometimes called Kuznets cycles) are much longer than 
the business cycles, somewhere between 15 and 25 years. 
Crises may lead to the loss of profitability of an invest-
ment, but they do not often lead to the loss of building 
fabric. Western cities are therefore made in the image of 
past capitalist decisions and subsequent adaptations to 
fit new circumstances. Harvey goes on to suggest ways 
in which class struggle is written into the landscape of 
the Western city (1985a: 27–31), which he explores in 
more detail in an analysis of Paris in the third quarter of 
the nineteenth century. More recently, Dodgshon (1998: 
148–61) has built on these arguments to show how the 
built environment of towns and cities is a major source 
of inertia in capitalist economies and societies.
There are perhaps two major phases of development 
in Western industrial cities before 1900, and the begin-
nings of a third. The first phase, which began in Britain 
in the 1770s, was characterized by the need to provide 
homes for workers once the production process was sep-
arated from home. Initially, such housing was provided 
by a process of ‘densification’ whereby more and more 
living spaces were crammed into the existing built-up 
area. Gardens and yards were used for increasingly high-
density basic accommodation, much of which was multi-
occupied. By the 1770s in larger British cities this process 
could go no further and housing began to be provided 
on the city fringe where it proved a profitable ‘crop’ for 
small landowners. Such housing was brick-built, basic, 
unplanned and unregulated, and regionally distinctive 
in its plan forms (Plate  2.2(a)). The most notorious of 
these forms was the back-to-back dwelling originating in 
the Yorkshire textile towns (Beresford 1988). The lack of 
regulation meant that these housing areas lacked effec-
tive water supplies, sewage and waste disposal systems, 
social and educational facilities, and connected road 
systems. The consequences, when combined with the 
poverty of low wages, were ill health, disease and very 
high urban death rates, especially among children. Euro-
pean and North American cities were also characterized 
by unregulated slum housing areas as urban populations 
rose from the 1820s onwards (Pounds 1990: 368–91; 
Homburger 1994: 110–11).
The second feature of this first phase of industrial cit-
ies was the separation of the residences of the bourgeoi-
sie from those of the workers. Industrial cities became 
class-divided cities, though the working classes, espe-
cially young females, were recruited to provide domestic 
services by the elite (Dennis 1984). In the southern states 
of the USA that servant class was African-American and 
still slaves until the 1860s. Thirdly, the capitalist land 
market began to value more highly the accessibility of 
the city centre and so the central business district began 
to emerge, as did districts in which industry and ware-
housing were the predominant land use, often close to 
the port facilities of canal, river frontage or harbour. 
One of the classic portrayals of this phase of urban 
development in Britain is Engels’ (1845) The Condition 
of the Working Class in England. Warehouse districts, 
of course, have recently been ‘revalued’ in many cities 
to become today’s loft apartments or high-tech offices 
(Zukin 1989).
The second phase of development, from 1840 to the 
1890s, was one of increasing regulation in towns and 
cities. New forms of local government and the collection 
of statistical information led to building regulations; the 
provision of sewerage and better water supplies; the

provision of new cemeteries and parks; and better urban 
transport, especially tramways. All this led in turn to the 
increasing suburbanization of the better-paid elements 
of the urban workforce in the last quarter of the nine-
teenth century. These transformations occurred in most 
European core economies, and in North American

cities, but with temporal variations. Thus, in England, 
the characteristic late-nineteenth-century dwelling was 
a suburban, brick-built, tunnel-back, terraced house 
(Plate  2.2(b)). In North America, excepting only the 
largest cities, the vast majority of urban housing was 
timber-built; in much of the rest of Europe, from Stock-
holm to Naples (as well as in Scotland), the apartment 
or tenement block was the norm (Plate  2.2(d)). The 
North American city, from the 1840s, was also char-
acterized by the ghettoization of immigrant popula-
tions: first Irish and Germans, then freed slaves from 
the southern states after the Civil War, then Italians, 
and finally, from the 1890s, Jewish migrants from  
the Russian empire of eastern Europe (Ward 1987) 
(Plate  2.3(d)).
Central business districts were modified by two other 
major transformations in the capitalist system in this 
second phase. First, banking services were increasingly 
required to enable surplus capital to be safely stored, 
efficiently invested and recycled towards new opportuni-
ties; such banks were but one aspect of developing office 
quarters, including, for example, insurance offices, land 
agents and other property services, and legal services. 
Many of these well-constructed buildings have been 
found alternative uses today, as cafes, pubs or homes, 
because they have become valued parts of city conserva-
tion areas. This tertiary employment sector grew rapidly 
in the second half of the nineteenth century and ‘the 
office’ developed as both a specialized building type and 
a means of production (Daniels 1975). It was increas-
ingly characterized by female employees using typewrit-
ers (the key technological invention) supervised by male 
managers. In North America the building type showed 
an increasing propensity to both large floor areas and 
height at the end of the century. The skyscraper was 
born in Chicago and relied on the development of steel-
frame construction methods and the invention of the 
elevator (Gad and Holdsworth 1987) (Plate  2.3(a) and 
(b)). Second was the growth of consumption. This led 
to the development of a variety of new retail spaces in  
city centres, including department stores and arcades 
(Plate  2.3(c)), as well as an enormous growth in the 
variety of specialized shops.
The incipient third phase of urban development 
reflected a minority interest in improving the living con-
ditions of workers by industrialists. Model settlements 
have a history that dates to the beginning of the factory 
system. Modern commentators note both the gener-
ally higher standard of accommodation in these places, 
and the capitalist control of the home life as well as the 
working life of their workers. At the century’s end the 
experimental garden suburb settlements at Bournville 
and Port Sunlight in England (Plate  2.2(c)) were widely 
admired and imitated in Germany (Margarethenhöhe 
in Essen, for example) and the USA (Radburn, New 
Jersey). At the same time, the first experiments in the 
large-scale provision of social housing were underway 
in London using apartment-block housing. These two 
themes, the garden suburb and social housing, were 
to combine powerfully in the development of modern 
planning to shape the urban environment in the first 
half of the twentieth century in Europe and its empires, 
but not in North America.
2.8	 Conclusion
Within three centuries, Western capitalism had utilized 
its ill-gotten gains from its first colonial adventures to 
develop a series of specialized industrial regions sup-
plying worldwide markets. Food production, industrial 
manufacture, service provision, consumption and trans-
portation were all radically transformed by the capital-
ist enterprise. Cultures, societies and governments were 
necessarily impelled to change, too. States became more 
centralized and powerful. The difference between rich 
and poor both at the level of individuals and between 
countries became more marked. For some individuals 
and groups capitalism brought prosperity, improved liv-
ing conditions and greater freedom; for others it brought 
destruction of local cultures, impoverishment, degrada-
tion and slavery. At the end of the nineteenth century 
the South African Boer War gave the first glimpse of the 
industrialization of warfare which was to scar the twen-
tieth century so deeply.

T
he twentieth century could be said to have been the 
period when capitalism finally triumphed over most 
of the globe. But it was neither a straightforward tri-
umph nor an unchallenged one, and capitalism itself was 
changed in the process. This chapter is concerned with 
the various spaces created by and in response to twen-
tieth- and twenty-first-century capitalism – spaces of 
resistance and reinterpretation as well as spaces of adap-
tation and acceptance. The patchy and unequal world in 
which we now live reflects the erratic and conflict-laden 
nature of the processes that have produced it, and we 
need to know something about those processes to under-
stand the world as it is now.
3.1	
The changing capitalism of the 
early twentieth century
In the autumn of the year 1933 the writer and journalist 
J.B. Priestley set out by bus on a trip that was to take him 
the length and breadth of England and which he later 
described in his English Journey (Priestley 1937). As he 
left London by the Great West Road, Priestley noted how 
the road ‘looked odd. Being new, it did not look English. 
We might have suddenly rolled into California.’ What 
struck Priestley as particularly odd was ‘the line of new 
factories on each side’ of the road. ‘Years of the West 
Riding’, he explained (he was born and raised in Bradford 
in northern England), ‘have fixed forever my idea of what 
a proper factory looks like: a grim, blackened rectangle 
with a tall chimney at one corner. These decorative lit-
tle buildings, all glass and concrete and chromium plate, 
seem to my barbaric mind to be merely playing at being 
factories.’ Armed with a copy of the now celebrated 
textbook, The British Isles: Geographic and Economic 
Survey by Stamp and Beaver (1933), which was later to 
be used by generations of geography undergraduates 
(including the present writer), Priestley went on to make 
some astute geographical and social points about these 
factories: ‘Actually, I know, they are tangible evidence, 
most cunningly arranged to take the eye, to prove that 
the new industries have moved south. You notice them 
decorating all the western borders of London. At night 
they look as exciting as Blackpool. But while these new 
industries look so much prettier than the old, which I 
remember only too well, they also look far less substan-
tial. Potato crisps, scent, tooth pastes, bathing costumes, 
fire extinguishers; those are the concerns behind these 
pleasing facades’ (Priestley 1937: 3–5).
In these few words, Priestley summarized some of the 
major ways in which the industrial world of the twen-
tieth century was to differ from its nineteenth-century 
predecessor. The fact that he was making his journey 
by road was itself significant; 30 years before he would 
have had to go by rail. The new factories he observed 
were the products of the technological changes that had 
been transforming industrial capitalism since the late 
nineteenth century, and many had clearly developed to 
serve an expanding consumer market (see Plates 3.1 and 
3.2). And the location of the factories by the new arterial 
highway leading westwards out of London was the result 
not only of a revolution in transport and communica-
tions but also of the locational freedom deriving from 
the availability of electricity and other fuels. The textile 
industries that Priestley remembered from his childhood

World War.

some other areas. Much of what was later to become 
known as the Third World, or the developing world, was 
still agricultural. Yet, in continuation of earlier processes 
(see Chapter 2, pp. 42–5, 50–2) many colonies and other 
regions were now being organized commercially to supply 
the industrial countries with raw materials and tropical 
products – for example, bananas and sugar from Cen-
tral America and the Caribbean, Brazilian coffee, Indian 
tea, Malaysian rubber. They were thus being tied in to 
the capitalist world economy. Gradually certain of these 
countries began to adopt the technologies of the indus-
trialized world – the rise of the Indian textile industry is 
one example – but only later in the twentieth century did 
industrialization become more widespread.
Thus the foundations of what is now known as a global 
economy were already being laid in Priestley’s day, or even 
earlier. By the beginning of the twentieth century capital-
ism had become a world phenomenon, tying far-flung 
countries together by means of international trade and fos-
tering international capital flows through major financial 
centres like London and New York. The first multinational 
corporations were already appearing. All this was aided 
and abetted by the new systems of communication and 
transport – telegraph, telephone, radio (from the 1900s), 
fast steamships, aircraft – which were beginning to pro-
vide services that spanned the globe. Of course, none of 
this bears comparison with the forces of globalization that 
were to become so significant later in the century. Yet the 
world was already becoming a smaller place (see Plate 3.8). 
J.B. Priestley himself suggested this when he compared the 
Great West Road to ‘California’. What might this mean to 
the average English reader in the 1930s? The answer is – a 
great deal. The Hollywood film industry in Los Angeles 
in Bradford were tied to the coalfields; the newer indus-
tries that were appearing in London by the 1930s no 
longer needed coal, and were much cleaner and brighter 
in consequence.
Of course, what Priestley saw along the Great West 
Road was by no means representative of all the technolog-
ical changes that had been affecting the industrial econo-
mies of Britain and other countries for the previous few 
decades. What had been happening in these countries was 
that a whole series of new industrial branches had been 
developing to supplement, and eventually to eclipse, the 
traditional activities based on coal, iron and textiles. Not 
all of these were as pleasing to the eye as those observed 
by Priestley. In the second half of the nineteenth century, 
for example, the metallurgical industries had been trans-
formed as a result of a series of inventions allowing the 
production of cheap steel. Next came the rapid devel-
opment and proliferation of different branches of the 
chemical industry (alkalis, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, 
explosives, lacquers, photographic plates and film, cel-
luloid, artificial fibres, plastics). The electricity genera-
tion industry, which began to flourish by the end of the 
nineteenth century, was dependent on earlier inventions, 
like the steam turbine. About the same time came the 
rise of the motor industry, which was in turn associated 
with other industries like oil and rubber. When Priestley 
set out on his journey, society was already beginning to 
adjust to the impact of the many new activities ­catering 
to the consumer (most notably, domestic appliances – 
see Plate 3.2) and to new means of transportation (car, 
bus, aircraft). Of course the full impact of such develop-
ments was to come later, after the Second World War, 
while some technologies, like regular TV broadcasting, 
the jet engine, nuclear power and the microchip, still lay 
in the future.
So profound were the technological and accompa-
nying social changes that affected industrial capitalism 
from the late nineteenth century that some historians 
have described them as a ‘second industrial revolution’ 
(Landes 1969: 4). But it is important to remember that the 
older industries – coal, textiles, railways, some forms of 
engineering – did not die immediately or indeed quickly. 
One of the features of the changing industrial geogra-
phy of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 
was that countries like the USA and Germany, whose 
industrialization came later than Britain’s, now began to 
forge ahead on the basis of the newer industries described 
above. Britain remained overdependent on the older and 
less dynamic branches (Figure 3.1).
For the first half of the twentieth century, the indus-
trial changes described above only directly affected cer-
tain parts of the world, notably Western Europe, North 
America, Japan, and by the 1930s the Soviet Union and

products which were becoming available for more

It was Karl Marx who originally emphasized the 
unplanned, competitive and even chaotic nature of 
capitalism’s development. But one of the features of the 
twentieth century has been the attempt, by both national 
governments and private agencies, to regulate and even 
to control it. The reasons for this phenomenon are many, 
but they are no doubt linked both to the precipitate 
nature of technological change during this period and 
to the severe fluctuations mentioned above. Attempts to 
‘organize’ capitalism have taken a number of different 
forms. For example, already in the late nineteenth cen-
tury, and especially in the USA and Germany, there were 
moves towards the formation of inter-firm agreements, 
cartels and larger companies and corporations. Large 
corporations could more easily marshal the huge capital 
resources which modern industry requires, and also influ-
ence their markets more effectively. As noted already, the 
first multinational corporations appeared at this time, 
those based in the USA being most notable. Nineteenth-
century examples include the German electrical firm, Sie-
mens, and the US Singer sewing machine company (see 
was in its heyday and the people, homes and landscapes it 
portrayed were being viewed, and copied, the world over.
3.2	 Fordist capitalism
It would be a mistake to suppose that the advance of 
capitalism in the twentieth century was a story of unmiti-
gated triumph. On the contrary, its fluctuations and mis-
fortunes were such that one historian felt constrained 
to call the period the ‘Age of Extremes’ (Hobsbawm 
1995). The first half of the century – Hobsbawm’s ‘Age 
of Catastrophe’ – was particularly disturbed, with two 
world wars (1914–18 and 1939–45) and a deep world eco-
nomic depression (1929–33).
By contrast, the years between 1945 and 1973 were 
ones of growing prosperity across much of the globe 
(Hobsbawm’s ‘Golden Age’) only to be followed once 
more by a disturbed period in the wake of the oil price 
rise shocks of the 1970s.

Chapter 3  The making of the twentieth- and twenty-first-century world    63
international monetary payments, promote trade and 
encourage economic development. At the national level, 
numerous countries, especially some of those in Western 
Europe, pursued democratic agenda of various kinds, 
such as attempts to construct ‘welfare states’ to tackle 
social problems like unemployment, ill health, old age 
and social inequity. Arguably the experience of govern-
ment planning and controls in wartime (and possibly also 
a fear of communism – see below) helped pave the way 
for the optimistic belief in the benefits of planning and 
large-scale social engineering that characterized the post-
war period. In Western Europe especially this was the era 
of bold experiments in new town and city development, 
slum clearance and ambitious social housing schemes, 
regional planning, and extensive controls over land use 
(Hall 2014). No doubt the success of these schemes was 
dependent on the spreading affluence that accompanied 
Hobsbawm’s ‘Golden Age’. Across Western Europe and 
North America a tide of suburbanization signalled not 
only a growing ability to own one’s own home in a desir-
able location but also the availability of the social and 
physical infrastructure, the private cars and the many 
new consumer products which now made such a goal 
possible for many (see Plate 3.4).
The writers Scott Lash and John Urry have described 
the era ushered in by the methods of Ford and Taylor 
that reached its apogee during the period 1945–73 as 
‘organized capitalism’ (Lash and Urry 1987). Some of its 
Plate 3.3). Twentieth-century examples include US-based 
Hoover, Ford, Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola, Nabisco (Shredded 
Wheat), and Kellogg’s, all of which invested in Britain in 
the 1930s. Most of the major international oil firms also 
date from this period.
A further way in which capitalism became more 
‘organized’ was the phenomenon of mass production, 
linked especially to the growing consumer market. Here 
two Americans are regarded as particularly significant. 
F.W. Taylor (1856–1915) is especially associated with 
time-and-motion studies, whereby complex tasks on the 
factory floor could be completed more efficiently and 
productivity increased. The other is Henry Ford (1863–
1947) who organized car production in his Dearborn, 
Michigan plant using modern methods like the assembly 
line and interchangeable parts. The result of his central-
ized approach was a significant reduction in the time 
and cost of producing cars, meaning they could now be 
manufactured on a mass basis. These production meth-
ods and associated patterns of mass consumption are 
frequently referred to as Fordism, hence the capitalism 
of this period is often referred to as Fordist capitalism.
Governments were also affected by the desire to 
‘organize’ capitalism and to tackle the many problems 
to which it seemed to give rise. At the international level, 
the USA, which emerged after the Second World War 
as the undisputed leader of world capitalism, took the 
lead in establishing a series of institutions like the World 
Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to ease 
Plate 3.4  Brick and render middle-class housing 
built in the suburbs of a West Yorkshire town in 
the 1930s. The suburbanization of the inter-war 
period was a product of the affluence and increased 
mobility of some middle-class groups at the time. 
Suburbanization was to become even more prominent 
after the Second World War.

64    Section 1  Worlds in the Past: Changing Scales of Experience and Past Worlds in the Present
John Betjeman’s famous fulminations against the 
town of Slough, situated just west of London and expe-
riencing developments similar to those observed by J.B. 
Priestley a few years earlier, are in fact a hymn against 
modernity. Betjeman was railing against many of the 
social repercussions of the profound twentieth-century 
changes noted earlier in this chapter. In this he was by no 
means alone. Similar attitudes have been characteristic 
of many commentators living in countries where moder-
nity (here defined as the spectrum of economic, social, 
political and cultural changes associated with twentieth-
century capitalism) has brought problems of adaptation.
It has already been noted that the twentieth century 
cannot be described as a century of uninterrupted pro-
gress for capitalism, particularly in its Western ‘liberal’ 
form. Capitalism has been subjected to a series of chal-
lenges and political struggles that greatly affected the 
course of twentieth-century history, and in various parts 
of the world there have been attempts to create spaces 
in which alternatives to liberal capitalism can flourish. 
Interestingly enough, in terms of Wallerstein’s world 
systems theory (discussed in Chapter 2; see p.  39), most 
of these attempts have been associated with countries 
outside the core, or with those like Germany after its 
principal features (which were especially characteristic of 
the developed world) are described in accordance with 
their views in Spotlight box  3.1.
Needless to say, such generalizations would be more 
or less true, depending on the time and location being 
considered. Capitalism had different histories in differ-
ent places, and the exact form it took had much to do 
with the long-term evolution of each society affected 
by it.

Spotlight box 3.1
Fordist or ‘organized’ capitalism
● Extractive and manufacturing industries are the 
dominant economic sectors.
● There is an accent on economies of scale, leading 
to the importance of large industrial plants. Such 
plants may structure entire regional economies 
around themselves. Examples might include (in the 
United Kingdom): the West Midlands, based on cars 
and engineering; Lancashire, based on cotton tex-
tiles; the North-East, based on mining, shipbuilding 
and heavy engineering; and (in the USA): Detroit, 
based on cars and engineering; and Philadelphia, 
based on textiles and port-related activities.
● Manufacturing plants are controlled centrally by big 
industrial corporations – there is an emphasis on 
mass production and standardization.
● There is state regulation of the economy to 
overcome problems generated by the market, for 
example regional unemployment problems.
● Big industrial cities are the spatial expression of 
large-scale manufacture.
● There is state-controlled welfare provision to even 
out social inequalities, address unemployment 
problems and raise health standards.
● In culture and social provision, there is an accent on 
mass provision, for example in housing, consumer 
goods, TV programming and newspapers. The 
emphasis on mass coverage and standardization

perspective.

Chapter 3  The making of the twentieth- and twenty-first-century world    65
One of the oddities of Nazism was that it was, at 
one and the same time, both reactionary and modern-
izing (Herf 1984). On the one hand, the Nazis looked 
backwards to an imagined heroic and rustic Germany 
of the past, to Nordic myths, Germanic towns and 
landscapes (see Rollins 1995; Hagen 2006) and happy 
peasants tilling the fields in traditional costume. They 
tried to bolster the ‘traditional’ family: women were to 
remain at home and raise children for the fatherland. 
There were even attempts to build villages and garden 
settlements to reflect such ideals. On the other hand, the 
Nazis were also modernizers who built the autobahns, 
fostered industry and spent vast sums on the military, 
organizing their capitalist economy to these ends. Their 
aim was to turn Germany into a superpower, able to 
dominate the European continent and regions beyond 
(see Chapter 20, pp. 407–10).
Nazism’s central and most notorious feature was its 
racism. Building on common European assumptions of 
racial and cultural superiority (prejudices which have 
by no means disappeared, even today), they taught that 
the Germans and related Aryan races were equipped 
by nature to dominate the globe. All non-Aryan peoples 
were regarded as inferior, particularly the Jews who, 
because of their culture, religion and cosmopolitan 
ways, seemed to represent all that the Nazis feared and 
hated. As time went on, it became clear that the Nazis 
meant to exterminate the Jews (they killed six million 
of them) as well as others (Roma peoples, homosexu-
als, the mentally ill, certain religious groups) who could 
have no place in the world they intended to reconstruct. 
The Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in Poland, which 
has been researched by geographers (Charlesworth et 
al. 2006; Knowles et al. 2014), is kept as a memorial to 
the huge numbers who were murdered and as a solemn 
warning to today’s world of the horrific consequences 
of racial prejudice.
Perhaps the most significant challenge to liberal 
capitalism in the twentieth century, however, came from 
Marxist-style communism (Calvocoressi 1991). By the 
1960s and 1970s up to one-third of humanity was living 
under communist governments that explicitly rejected 
capitalism as an acceptable way of organizing society. 
The reasons for that rejection and why it largely failed 
must now be considered.
An outline of some of the principal features of 
Marxism is given in Spotlight box  3.2. An important 
point is that Marx’s teachings failed to change those 
societies at which they were initially aimed – the indus-
trial societies of Western Europe and North America. 
Marx himself had expected that communism would find 
support among the growing industrial working classes 
of countries like Germany and Britain, where factories 
defeat in the First World War struggling to rejoin the 
core states. Particularly important for the political geog-
raphy of the twentieth century were the attempts by 
Marxists and others to reject the capitalist development 
model entirely and to reconstruct society on a new basis. 
This issue will be discussed below. First, however, atten-
tion will be paid to another twentieth-century move-
ment that challenged Western-style capitalism without 
discarding it entirely: Nazism, together with its close 
relative, Fascism.
Although they had nineteenth-century anteced-
ents, both Fascism and Nazism were essentially prod-
ucts of the inter-war years. Fascism, under its leader 
­Benito Mussolini, ruled in Italy from 1922 until its 
final defeat in the Second World War in 1945. Nazism 
under Adolf Hitler ruled Germany from 1933 until it 
too was defeated in 1945. Various Fascist or neo-Fascist 
groups ruled or were active elsewhere in Europe, and in  
some other regions, during this period, and to a lesser 
extent since.
There is no doubt that Nazism was by far the most 
influential Fascist movement after 1933, and so the fol-
lowing brief remarks will be devoted to it (Kershaw 
2000). One of the problems of discussing Nazism or 
other forms of Fascism is their lack of a consistent ideol-
ogy or philosophy. However, certain general points can 
be made. Like certain Western intellectuals and others, 
the Nazis were moved by a dislike of facets of capital-
ist modernity, such as commercialism, materialism, indi-
vidualism, threats to the traditional family like the rise of 
female employment (see Plate 3.4), and similar tendencies 
that they associated with the ‘decadent’ Western democ-
racies. They also despised Western-style parliamentary 
democracy, with its plurality of political parties and class 
divisions. In its place, they advocated the concept of a 
single national community, a Volksgemeinschaft, headed 
by a single Leader or Führer (Hitler), who was regarded 
as representative of, and chosen by, the people (this was 
the Nazi concept of ‘democracy’). The Leader’s power 
was absolute. Such a creed, however, seemed exceedingly 
unlikely to come to power in Germany in the early 1930s 
had it not been for the extreme circumstances reigning 
there. One was a general sense of resentment at Ger-
many’s defeat in the First World War and subsequent 
national humiliations. As extreme nationalists, the Nazis 
promised to avenge this defeat. Another was the dire eco-
nomic and social straits to which many of the middle 
class had been reduced by post-First World War inflation 
and the Depression that began in 1929. There was also 
the fear of the many strikes and disorders perpetrated by 
communists and other left-wing groups (as well as by the 
Nazis) that were, of course, encouraged by the selfsame 
economic difficulties.

66    Section 1  Worlds in the Past: Changing Scales of Experience and Past Worlds in the Present
of this extraordinary economic system was both to 
speed the process of economic development and to 
build up the country’s military resources. As the 1930s 
advanced, it became clear that what had earlier seemed 
a rather vague threat from the outside capitalist world 
was beginning to take a concrete and menacing form in 
the guise of Nazi Germany. The centrally planned or 
command economy (which involved much suffering on 
the part of the Soviet people) eventually proved equal 
to this challenge. In the ensuing war with Germany 
were bringing such groups together in increasing num-
bers. However, it was by no means obvious, as the years 
passed, that the workers of those countries were neces-
sarily being increasingly exploited, as Marx seems to 
have expected (later, these countries were accused by 
Marxists of exporting exploitation to colonies and 
other less developed regions). Instead, Marxism tri-
umphed in Russia (in 1917), in what was in fact the least 
industrialized of Europe’s great powers. Thus, whereas 
in terms of Wallerstein’s world systems theory Marxism 
was expected to find favour in the core countries, in fact 
it initially triumphed in a semi-peripheral one. That it 
did so changed the character of Marxism, which was 
now faced with the challenge of building socialism in 
a peasant society, and in virtual isolation from the rest 
of the world.
What happened after 1917 in Russia (or the Soviet 
Union as it was now to be called) was of profound 
importance for the other countries that later adopted 
communist systems, if only because Russia was the 
pioneer. What happened there began to assume some-
thing of the character of orthodoxy (Sakwa 1999). In 
view of the difficulties they faced, and in all likelihood 
because of their own inclinations, the Bolsheviks (as 
the Russian or Soviet communists were called) adopted 
a highly centralized political system that brooked no 
opposition and entailed the destruction of the previ-
ous ruling and capitalist class. Eventually, from the late 
1920s, they implemented a fully centrally planned eco-
nomic system. This involved the abolition of private 
enterprise and virtually all forms of market relations, 
and the collectivization of agriculture. The purpose

Marxism
● Marxism, which derives from the teachings of Karl 
Marx (1818–83), is related to other forms of social-
ism that seek to moderate or reform the injustices 
of capitalism.
● Unlike some other forms of socialism, Marxism 
regards capitalism as an innately unjust and exploit-
ative system.
● According to Marxism, capitalism divides society 
into antagonistic classes: those who own the main 
sources of wealth (the capitalists) and those who 
must live by selling their labour to the capitalists 
(the proletariat).
● Marxism teaches that the capitalists are forced by 
the very nature of capitalism to maximize the profits 
they obtain at the expense of the workers.
● Marx thought that eventually capitalism would 
become so exploitative and prone to crises that its 
downfall was inevitable.
● It would then be replaced by a much more just, 
classless society (socialism, gradually maturing into 
communism).
● In the meantime Marx exhorted the world’s workers 
(especially the industrial workers) to organize politi-
cally to hasten capitalism’s downfall.

to the whole idea of capitalism (Sakwa 1999). Internally, 
whilst it led to attempts to reconstruct society on a dif-
ferent basis, it did in fact give rise to new forms of spa-
tial inequality (Bater 1986). Interestingly enough it also 
had certain spatial features in common with Nazism 
and Fascism, such as an emphasis on creating urban 
spaces specifically for the purpose of mass ceremonial 
and display (Plate 3.6). The creation of ‘spaces of ter-
ror’, such as concentration camps for the incarceration 
or elimination of those deemed unacceptable to the 
regime, was also a feature of the two systems (Moran 
2004; Pallot 2005).
In the end, communism failed to prove itself a 
­successful, viable challenger to capitalism. Especially 
from the 1970s, the Soviet Union and its eastern Euro-
pean allies fell behind their capitalist rivals in terms 
of productivity, flexibility and innovation. Whether 
this was because of problems inherent to command 
economies as such, or whether it has more to do with 
mistakes made by the various political leaderships, is 
hard to say. Whatever the reasons, by the end of the 
1980s practically the whole of the communist world 
was in a state of economic and political crisis. The 
subsequent fall of communism in eastern Europe, and 
the splitting of the Soviet Union into 15 separate states 
in 1991, signalled the end of the Cold War. Since then 
the post-communist states, plus China which continues 
to pursue its own version of socialism ‘with Chinese 
characteristics’, have been struggling to adapt to the 
market economy and in other ways to cope with the 
problems of post-communist transformation (Gwynne 
et al. 2003: 59–72, 101–8).
(1941–5), the Soviet Union emerged victorious, but only 
after sustaining enormous losses.
Soviet victory in the Second World War greatly 
enhanced that country’s prestige. Moreover, because 
the Soviet armies were now in occupation of much of 
central and eastern Europe, they were able to ensure 
that regimes friendly to the Soviet Union (that is, com-
munist regimes) would assume power in those regions. 
Communism soon spread into other countries, notably 
China (in 1949), south-east Asia and beyond: in other 
words, into Wallerstein’s ‘periphery’. All these countries 
initially followed the Soviet development model, but soon 
found that it was necessary to adapt it to their own needs. 
In the meantime the spread of communism, and Soviet 
ambitions, excited the suspicions of the capitalist West. 
After 1945, therefore, the world was split into two armed 
camps, both equipped with nuclear weapons. The ensu-
ing confrontation, known as the Cold War, profoundly 
influenced both sides and encouraged their militarization 
(see Chapter 20, pp. 410–13). However, many countries, 
especially in the developing world, tried to avoid taking 
sides, while China, though communist, began to pursue 
its own version of communism outside the Soviet sphere.
While the actual form that communism took in the 
Soviet Union and other countries may have been a modi-
fication of Marx’s own ideas, it did represent a radical 
departure from the capitalist development model. Not 
only was the command economy a very different, state-
centred approach to economic development (and one 
which was copied in many parts of the developing world 
after the Second World War, with varying degrees of 
success), it regarded itself, and was regarded, as a threat

captured by Rudyard Kipling in his comic poem ‘We and 
They’, quoted above.
However, the future of European imperialism was 
already being questioned even before the First World War. 
The English liberal J.A. Hobson, and later the Russian rev-
olutionary V.I. Lenin, popularized the idea that Europe’s 
overseas colonies were being economically organized and 
exploited mainly for the benefit of the European ‘mother 
countries’, forming an undeveloped periphery to the Euro-
pean core. Lenin taught that imperialism was an inevita-
ble consequence of capitalism – its ‘highest stage’. In the 
meantime various rumblings of discontent were being felt 
in various parts of the European empires.
But it was the three great episodes of the first half of 
the twentieth century – the First World War, the Great 
Depression (1929–33) and the Second World War – that 
fatally undermined European imperialism. Nationalism, 
which had had such an impact on the political geography 
of Europe (see Chapter 22), had also influenced the colo-
nial world where ‘national liberation movements’ began 
to demand independence for their countries. Starting 
with the independence of India in 1947, the next quarter

At the beginning of the twentieth century Britain and 
several other European powers sat proudly at the centre 
of a series of empires that spanned the globe (Figure 3.2). 
As noted in Chapter 2, these empires were the products of 
a long period of European exploration, settlement, eco-
nomic exploitation and imperial rivalry. Something of the 
complacency and condescension with which Europeans 
commonly regarded their empires at this period is nicely

Chapter 3  The making of the twentieth- and twenty-first-century world    69
of Western models was not always a suitable response 
to their problems. For example, many of the new states 
attempted to copy the European idea of the nation-
state, hoping to unite their peoples around a common 
sense of national identity. But the old colonial bounda-
ries had generally been drawn up to suit imperial con-
venience rather than that of local communities. Thus 
these boundaries, now the boundaries of independent 
states, frequently grouped peoples into one state who 
had no common culture or history while dividing others 
who did so. This contributed little to the political stabil-
ity or unity of many new states. Another problem was 
the feeling among many citizens of the new states that 
the capitalist economy was responsible for the underde-
velopment of their countries. This set off a search for 
socialist or communist alternatives, much to the annoy-
ance of the West, and encouraged debates about the 
meaning of ‘development’ (see Chapter 8, pp. 176–9). 
Finally, fundamental questions were frequently posed 
about how far modernization, as generally understood, 
was compatible with the traditions of the former colo-
nial peoples. The Islamic revival, discussed below, can 
be seen as one response to this dilemma.
Just as imperialism had a profound impact on the 
political and social geographies of enormous areas in 
Africa, Asia and the Americas, it equally affected the 
imperial countries themselves. One of the most impor-
tant manifestations of this in the twentieth century was 
the flow of migrants from colonies and former colonies, 
especially in the tropics and sub-tropics, to take up jobs 
in the former imperial states. This naturally had a far-
reaching cultural impact in cities and regions in Western 
Europe. In fact the whole experience of imperialism led 
to the mixing of peoples and cultures on a grand scale. It 
also led to widespread questioning of long-held assump-
tions about European (and often male) cultural superior-
ity (see Chapter 2, p. 47).
Many scholars have argued that the end of European 
colonialism did not mean the end of exploitative rela-
tionships between the core countries of the world econ-
omy (including the former imperial powers) and what 
was now increasingly referred to as the ‘Third World’. 
According to such thinkers, the formal imperialism of 
the colonial era had merely been replaced by a more 
‘informal’ alternative, but the basic situation of the core 
exercising hegemony over the periphery had not really 
changed (Wallerstein 1980; Frank and Dutt 2002). From 
the 1970s, however, some fundamental changes seemed 
to affect the world economy which, in the opinion of 
certain scholars, demanded that international rela-
tionships be viewed in a new way. Lash and Urry have 
described these changes as ‘the end of organized capital-
ism’ (Lash and Urry 1987).
of a century witnessed the break-up of all the European 
empires (though the Soviet Union, successor to the old 
Russian empire, finally disappeared only in 1991). Many 
new, independent states appeared on the map of Africa, 
Asia and other regions, though not, unfortunately, with-
out considerable turmoil in some cases. The world’s 
political geography was transformed.
In giving (or being forced to give) independence to 
their colonies, the former imperial powers hoped that 
they would adopt European-type political systems 
and capitalist economic systems, partly because these 
appeared the best basis for future development, and 
partly because they seemed a reasonable way of uphold-
ing European influence. The elites who were now to 
hold power in the new states were often sympathetic to 
these aims, since they had frequently been educated by 
Europeans and wished to see their countries modernized 
along European or Western lines. However, the adoption

transnational corporations. Many manufacturing and 
service firms now began to locate in parts of the Third 
World, where costs were lower, whilst core industrial 
countries began to experience deindustrialization and 
a switch into services and ‘control’ functions (the head-
quarters of the transnational corporations still tended 
to be located in the traditional core countries). A fur-
ther important result of the development of information 
technology was that production became much more flex-
ible than before and more geared up to highly specialized 
markets, changing fashion and the whim of the individual 
consumer. This new, more flexible approach to produc-
tion is sometimes known as post-Fordism.
Later chapters of this book will explore some of 
the specific economic and social implications of these 
changes. Meanwhile, it is worth stressing here how unset-
tling such developments have been, especially for the core 
countries. The years of growing affluence after 1945 were 
succeeded, from the mid-1970s, by a period of greater 
uncertainty as deindustrialization gathered pace (see 
Plate 3.8), unemployment rose, insecurity became more 
widespread, and social inequality became more appar-
ent. By the century’s end it seemed that Western-style 
capitalism and democracy were increasingly threatened 
and, if anything, the feeling of threat and uncertainty has 
grown into the new century. The last part of this chapter 
will briefly survey some of the factors that lie behind that 
uncertainty.
Just as Lash and Urry used the term ‘organized capi-
talism’ to describe the years down to about 1973 when 
Fordism reached its apogee, so they have described the 
closing years of the twentieth century as those of ‘disor-
ganized capitalism’. Some of its more prominent features 
are listed in Spotlight box  3.3, once again paying particu-
lar attention to how the changes have affected the core 
countries of the world economy.
3.5	 Globalized capitalism
In 1960 the industrialized areas of Western Europe and 
North America produced almost 80  per cent of the 
world’s industrial output. Even Japan accounted for only 
around 4 per cent. Much of the Third World remained 
agricultural. Only after this time did industrialization 
spread beyond its traditional centres (which since the 
1930s had included the Soviet Union). Meanwhile many 
of the older industrial countries began to lose industries, 
even some of those which had arrived with the twentieth 
century.
Of course, some areas of the ‘Third World’ benefited 
far more from this industrial spread than did others. Most 
spectacularly, the newly industrialized countries of 
East Asia, Brazil, Mexico and certain others soon seemed 
set to join the industrial core. Yet others, like certain Mid-
dle Eastern states, earned huge revenues from their energy 
exports. But there remained many areas, especially in 
Africa, which missed out on the new developments (even 
so the latter part of the twentieth century was a period 
of unprecedented population growth and urbanization 
across much of the developing world – see Chapters 4  
and 9). The term ‘Third World’, used to group together 
countries with such disparate economic characters, 
seemed increasingly redundant, and the world as a whole 
seemed as unequal as ever (Sidaway 2012).
How is one to explain the changes affecting the world’s 
economic geography in the last third of the twentieth 
century and at the beginning of the twenty-first? Geog-
raphers and others argued that such changes are part of 
the process of globalization. Speedier communications 
meant that the world was becoming a much smaller 
place as the twentieth century drew towards its close. 
Capitalism itself was now a truly global phenomenon as 
markets were internationalized and finance became fully 
mobile. Before 1960, despite the importance of interna-
tional trade, the world economy was structured around 
individual states. After 1960, the world economy became 
in effect transnational as the boundaries of individual 
states became ever less important to its functioning. Thus 
this period witnessed the rise to global importance of 
the transnational corporations, commercial conglomer-
ates which became major players on a world scale (see 
Chapters 14 and 16). Because of the wealth and politi-
cal influence they wielded, such huge companies became 
increasingly free to switch their operations from country 
to country as economic circumstances dictated. States, 
which had previously seemed unchallenged within their 
own frontiers, found it ever more difficult to control their 
own economies and began to bid against one another 
to attract footloose investment and the favours of the

through ‘free markets’. Just how ‘free’ markets were 
meant to be he did not say. But in the opinion of many, 
what Fukuyama was celebrating at the dawn of the new 
millennium was in effect the final triumph of Western-
style capitalism, and of the Western way of life, over the 
rest of the world – an awesome claim indeed.
Now in the second decade of the new millennium, and 
more than 20 years since Fukuyama published his book, 
it is probably true to say that relatively few people are as 
optimistic about the prospects for liberal democracy as 
he evidently was. In fact the future seems as uncertain as 
ever and ‘liberal democracy’ (whatever that might mean 
in practice) is faced with new challenges, some of which 
were perhaps only dimly discernible when Fukuyama 
wrote. Understanding these challenges forms the sub-
stance of the chapters which follow. Here we can only 
summarize the most significant among them.
3.6.1 Economic challenges
Fukuyama published his book at a time when most 
Western states, and many others as well, had strongly 
espoused the economic doctrine known as neoliberal-
ism. This was a reaction to the disappointing economic 
3.6	
The world in the early  
twenty-first century
In 1992, some three years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
an event which is regarded as marking the end of the 
Cold War (see Plate 3.7), the American political scientist 
Francis Fukuyama published a book entitled The End of 
History and the Last Man (Fukuyama 1992). Here Fukuy-
ama made some startling claims regarding what he saw 
as the recent global triumph of ‘liberal democracy’. The 
end of the Cold War, Fukuyama asserted, meant that lib-
eral democracy had now ‘conquered rival ideologies like 
hereditary monarchy, fascism and . . . communism’ and 
that this triumph marked ‘the end point of mankind’s 
ideological evolution’. He went on to announce that 
‘while earlier forms of government were characterized 
by grave defects and irrationalities that led to their even-
tual collapse, liberal democracy [is] arguably free from 
such internal contradictions’. Hence ‘the ideal of liberal 
democracy could not be improved on’. A close reading 
of Fukuyama’s text reveals that what he had in mind by 
‘liberal democracy’ was not only a specific political sys-
tem but also a way of organizing the economy, namely 
Spotlight box 3.3
Globalized or ‘disorganized’ capitalism
● The onset of ‘disorganized capitalism’ is marked 
by a decline in the relative importance of extractive 
and manufacturing industries.
● There is a relative increase in the importance of 
service and consumer industries, especially in 
employment.
● The use of flexible technologies encourages a 
reduction in the average size of manufacturing 
plants with more accent on labour-saving invest-
ments and more flexible employment processes, all 
induced by competition.
● Because of the need for flexibility and cost-cutting, 
industrial firms tend to ‘hive off’ many of the ser-
vices and supporting activities they need to other 
firms and organizations. There are thus more 
opportunities for small firms, changing the tradition-
ally specialized nature of the regional economy.
● Regional economies are also affected by the 
greater emphasis on non-standardized  
production – traditional regional specializations 
become less marked.
● The global economy reduces the effectiveness of 
state attempts at economic regulation – from the 
state’s point of view, the economy becomes less 
predictable.
● Rising costs, demands for reduced taxation, and 
growing social inequality challenge the idea of a 
centralized welfare state.
● Smaller, more footloose industries, the rise of ser-
vices, better communications and other factors 
reduce the traditional importance of big, industrial cit-
ies by comparison with small towns and rural areas.
● There is a rise in importance of the educated social 
strata needed to work in the new administrative, 
control, service and related activities – the so-called 
‘service class’ – with more sophisticated and individ-
ualized tastes in consumption and other areas. The 
age of mass cultural provision is replaced by greater 
cultural fragmentation and pluralism (sometimes 
referred to as post-modernism). There is a com-
mensurate decline in faith in large-scale planning 
and similar activities associated with modernism.

public expenditure of various kinds (whose reduction is 
partly associated with the neoliberal policy of lowering 
taxes) suffer deprivation as well as the unemployment 
and other problems invariably associated with a volatile 
economy (see Chapter 10).
Many wonder whether such levels of inequality are 
compatible with the maintenance of free and democratic 
polities. Meanwhile, at an international scale, numer-
ous scholars regard neoliberal attitudes as being partly 
responsible for the growing economic inequalities and 
other disparities between countries in different parts of 
the world (Stiglitz and Charlton 2007; see Chapter 8). It is 
argued that the factors encouraging this include the inap-
propriate ways in which the rules governing international 
trade have been applied to developing countries, and the 
hypocritical way in which many Western countries, hav-
ing espoused free trade principles as applied to other 
countries, actively seek to avoid their full application in 
their own case. In consequence, whilst Western countries 
pump huge amounts of aid into poorer countries, this is 
more than counteracted by the trade policies they pursue.
3.6.2 Geopolitical challenges
At the time Fukuyama published his book it seemed safe 
to assume that, with the collapse of communism and the 
Soviet Union, the United States would be left as the only 
remaining superpower, well placed to dominate the rest 
of the globe. Thus there dawned the vision of a world 
organized in accordance with a Pax Americana, whereby 
the benefits of American democracy and of the Western 
way of life more generally might spread to the rest of 
the globe. Again, however, in the second decade of the 
twenty-first century, this vision now seems too simplis-
tic for a number of reasons. One, mentioned above, has 
been the phenomenal rise of China and of other parts of 
East Asia in the recent period (Dicken 2015). Economic 
power, of course, invariably means political power, and in 
this situation the United States’ geopolitical dominance 
is no longer assured (see Chapters 20 and 23), especially 
since, according to some estimates, China is now the 
world’s biggest economy. A symptom of the changing 
situation lies in the growing competition and disagree-
ment between the USA and China in such areas as trade 
relations, currency policy and industrial policy as well 
as disputes over such matters as human rights and pub-
lic access to the Internet. A further symptom erupted in 
2014 when civil war in Ukraine, arising out of disputes 
over whether the country’s future lay with the EU and 
NATO to the west or with its eastern neighbours includ-
ing Russia, resulted in Western sanctions against Russia 
and the threat of a much wider conflict (Sakwa 2015a). 
Thus the blithe assumption that the USA can order the 
record of the 1970s and promised to achieve high and 
sustainable economic growth through freeing up markets, 
privatizing as much of the economy and associated activ-
ity as possible, and restructuring the state (see Hendrikse 
and Sidaway 2010). In the event the actual record of eco-
nomic achievement was much more modest than had been 
hoped for (Harvey 2006: 30, 42; Dicken 2015) and there 
was much volatility on the world market. Furthermore, 
the removal or absence of regulation over much economic 
activity seemed to encourage financial speculation and 
even corruption in many places, culminating in a major 
international banking crisis in 2008, and precipitating 
economic recession and a crisis in the Eurozone in 2011. 
As a result many countries found themselves deeply in 
debt and were forced to make major cuts in public spend-
ing which especially disadvantaged the poorer elements 
in society. As we have seen, this was not the first occasion 
that Western-style capitalism has been seized with crisis. 
But this recent occurrence has caused many to question 
whether the way in which the world economy has been 
managed recently has been sensible and whether some 
alternative policy should now be adopted, particularly 
as some countries like China have very successfully pur-
sued rather different (and more state-centred) economic 
policies. Indeed, some economic analysts have suggested 
that the West can no longer assume economic dominance 
over the rest of the world with rising economic powers 
like China and India now entering the fray. The West’s 
days as the centre of the global economy may thus be 
numbered. Some of these issues are discussed further in 
Chapters 14 and 16.
There is an additional reason why many people have 
begun to question the wisdom of a neoliberal approach 
to economic policy. This is the growing inequalities that 
it seems to engender. For example, many countries that 
have adopted neoliberal economic and social policies have 
experienced the emergence of huge gaps between rich and 
poor. Indeed, according to a report issued by the charity 
Oxfam in January 2015, 1 per cent of the world’s popu-
lation will soon own more wealth than the remaining 
99 per cent! Thus, at one end of the scale, many people 
now enjoy previously unimaginable income levels, ben-
efiting among other things from low levels of taxation, 
allowing them to escape the consequences of the reduc-
tions in public expenditure which are the hallmark of 
neoliberalism. In the UK and other countries the public 
concern expressed at the levels of payments and bonuses 
being made to bankers and others whose activities are 
widely regarded as having precipitated the 2008 bank-
ing crisis (which resulted in huge investments of public 
money to rescue the faltering banks) is symptomatic of a 
broader dissatisfaction. And, at the other end, many of 
the poor, who are most dependent on public welfare and

world according to its wishes and that the rest of the 
world will gladly adopt American values is questionable. 
This is quite apart from the problem of the numerous 
poor and peripheral states across the world (Afghanistan 
and Somalia, for example) which neither the USA nor 
China nor anyone else seems able to control.
Given the rising significance of China and other parts 
of Asia in the recent period, it has become fashionable 
among certain scholars to attempt to explain this phe-
nomenon from a long-term, historical perspective (see, 
for example, Frank 1998; Darwin 2007). Andre Gunder 
Frank’s book, ReOrient (Frank 1998), is a case in point. 
Contrary to the ideas of Wallerstein and others (see 
Chapter 2, p. 39), his thesis is that by the year 1500 there 
was already a single global economy in existence cen-
tred on Asia whose roots went back many thousands of 
years. In this global system Europe was both relatively 
and absolutely marginal and continued to be so until 
about 1800 when it assumed dominance over Asia, partly 
because of its successful conquest of the Americas. Thus, 
according to Frank, there is nothing particularly surpris-
ing about Asia’s recent resurgence. Hence he is challeng-
ing the rather Eurocentric perspective adopted in the first 
three chapters of this book as well, it might be said, as 
that adopted by the overwhelming majority of Western 
historians and other scholars.
3.6.3 Environmental challenges
In the opinion of many people, the most urgent prob-
lem facing the world today is that of environmental 
change, and in particular climate change. As we saw in  
Chapter 1, there is nothing new about the idea of human 
beings changing the environments in which they live. 
Indeed they have probably done so ever since they first 
appeared on earth. But what has become particularly 
worrying in the most recent period is the notion that 
such changes are now becoming unsustainable and are 
beginning to threaten not only our way of life but also, 
perhaps, our very existence. Concern about such matters 
goes back many years, to the nineteenth century at least, 
but became more pressing from about the 1960s when 
some of the environmental consequences of continuous 
economic growth became more noticeable. Thus alarm 
began to be expressed about the possibility of the world 
running out of its most significant resources, especially 
energy resources, a worry that has hardly diminished 
as the search for oil and gas now impinges on the Polar 
and sub-Polar regions, some of the most ecologically 
fragile regions on earth. Likewise, there is concern over 
the loss of biodiversity, associated among other things 
with the pressure to intensify agriculture and to expand 
food production to feed the world’s rapidly growing 
population (itself a problem of the utmost importance; see  
Chapters 4 and 15). Needless to say, the impoverishment 
of the web of life, or the biosphere as it is often called, 
which sustains life on earth could have catastrophic con-
sequences for everyone. A related issue, one that has been 
vividly illustrated during 2013–15 by the Ebola crisis in 
West Africa, is the spread of new diseases or the revival 
of old ones. Thus the apparently reducing effectiveness of 
antibiotics exacerbated by their overuse might in future 
result in bacterial-borne diseases like tuberculosis becom-
ing major killers once again.
The issue of climate change has come on to the agenda 
recently as data have become available showing that the 
continuous emission of carbon dioxide and other green-
house gases into the atmosphere, which is a hallmark 
of industrial societies, may already have led to marked 
(and in some opinions unstoppable) climate change. 
Increases in the incidence and intensity of hurricanes, 
bush fires, floods, droughts, heat waves are, in the opin-
ion of some, symptoms of climate change. In the more 
extreme scenarios, the complete melting of the polar 
icecaps, the flooding of much of the earth’s low-lying 
(and most densely populated) regions, and catastrophic 
changes elsewhere, are predicted.
There is no need to emphasize the point that the more 
dramatic predictions regarding the dire consequences 
of continuous and unsustainable environmental change 
threaten the entire basis of our modern way of life. We 
must either change our entire mode of life, it seems, or 
hope, through further technological development for 
example, to solve some of the most pressing problems. 
But even then it is difficult to envisage the model of con-
tinuous economic growth in the way we understand it 
now being sustainable in the longer term, at least on this 
planet. Not surprisingly, given the rhetoric surrounding 
environmental issues (and, perhaps, the vested interests 
who might be threatened if the more dramatic scenarios 
are taken seriously), there are those who discount such 
claims, questioning some of the evidence supporting cli-
mate change and other predictions. The whole question is 
therefore controversial. Some of the ramifications of the 
environmental debates, and their political implications, 
are explored in Chapters 4–7.
3.6.4 Value and identity issues
On the first anniversary of the 9/11 attack on the World 
Trade Center in New York, US President George W. Bush 
made the following declaration:
We will use our position of unparalleled strength and 
influence to build an atmosphere of international 
order and openness in which progress and liberty can 

74    Section 1  Worlds in the Past: Changing Scales of Experience and Past Worlds in the Present
flourish in many nations. A peaceful world of growing 
freedom serves American long-term interests, reflects 
American ideals and unites America’s allies . . . We 
seek a just peace where repression, resentment and 
poverty are replaced with the hope of democracy, 
development, free markets and free trade . . . 
(quoted in Harvey 2006: 11).
In this declaration, President Bush clearly implied that 
such ‘ideals’ are not only American but also need adopt-
ing by the rest of the world.
But what exactly is ‘freedom’ in a world in which, 
for example, the USA has felt able to imprison so-called 
‘terrorists’ in its Guantanamo Bay prison camp without 
trial and allegedly even used torture on them? Or what is 
‘democracy’ in a world where the USA and its allies back 
numerous repressive regimes in their own security inter-
ests, or where politicians, having made certain promises 
to their electorates, appear to feel free to do the exact 
opposite once they are elected as well as engaging in 
corrupt practices in certain cases? No wonder that such 
vaunted ‘values’ are being questioned in many quarters 
rather than simply being accepted as presented.
In fact the whole area of values, what they mean and 
whose interests they serve, seems to be an increasingly 
contested one (witness the ongoing debate about ‘British 
values’ in the UK). This is linked to the issue of identity. 
Perhaps related to feelings of social injustice and/or loss 
of certainty and personal autonomy in an increasingly 
globalized world, more and more people appear to feel 
the need to assert their distinctiveness and their freedom 
either as individuals or as groups. Movements like femi-
nism, gay liberation and animal rights are a case in point. 
Another is the recent rise of fundamentalist religious 
movements among many established faiths, whether it 
be among Christians, Muslims, Hindus or others (some-
times, it must be said, in reaction against some of the 
movements mentioned above, and sometimes against the 
materialism and secularism which are such a feature of 
modern life). In many Western countries, for example, 
the problem of ‘radicalization’ of some Muslim youth, 
whereby, apparently under the influence of the Inter-
net, some have been travelling to join militant groups in 
the Middle East, has been a cause of concern to politi-
cians. Rising nationalism also seems to be a problem in 
many parts of the world. Thus whereas Fukuyama airily 
assumed that, in Western Europe at least, nationalism 
was being ‘tamed’, the demands for regional or ethnic 
autonomy, or recognition, seem by no means to be abat-
ing. For example, the September, 2014 referendum on 
whether Scotland should become an independent state 
saw a voter turnout of almost 85 per cent with nearly 
45  per cent of voters supporting independence. The 
long-term consequences of this strong pro-independence 
vote for the stability of the United Kingdom have yet to be 
seen. Elsewhere in the world, nationalism has often been 
an even more significant issue.
Unfortunately the debates over issues of values and 
identity have sometimes given rise to disorder and even 
outright violence. Some of these points are explored fur-
ther in Chapters 13 and 22.
3.6.5 Security issues
The horrifying attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, 
a French satirical magazine, in January 2015, an attack 
which caused the deaths of 12 people and injuries to 11 
others, was a sharp reminder to the West of a phenomenon 
which is all too common elsewhere in the world. The Paris 
attack, horrific as it was, pales by comparison with other 
terrorist activities elsewhere in the world. For example, the 
actions of Boko Haram in Nigeria and some neighbouring 
countries are believed to have caused the deaths of more 
than 5,000 civilians up to June 2014. In this case there 
are clear links with Islamic fundamentalism. But the link 
between Islam and terrorism should not be overstressed as 
it involves only a tiny minority of Muslims. The fact is that 
the Islamic revival, which is associated with the desire to 
return to traditional Muslim values on the part of many 
who reject Western values based on secularism and mate-
rialism (and thus Western-style capitalism), is a far more 
broadly based movement than any misleading attempt to 
link it with terrorism might imply (Park 1994; Esposito 
1995). In the opinion of the majority of scholars, Islam and 
the adoption of terrorist tactics are incompatible.
Clearly, however, the dangers and apparent frequency 
of terrorist acts are a sharp reminder of the limits to the 
power of states in an increasingly globalized world. They 
are a challenge to the democratic freedoms enjoyed in 
many states (despite the caveats about the meaning of the 
term ‘democracy’ outlined above), not least because they 
encourage governments to adopt more and more strin-
gent security measures. But terrorism in the above sense is 
by no means the only security threat to menace states and 
communities as the twenty-first century advances. One 
might mention the spread of weapons of mass destruc-
tion, including chemical and biological weapons, and the 
possibility of cyber-terrorism, as two that are particularly 
worrying (see Chapter 20). Many states and citizens are 
also concerned about the issue of international migration 
as a security concern. Encouraged by such events as wars 
and disturbances, ecological catastrophes and economic 
hardship, such movements are often most unfortunately 
targeted by right-wing political elements eager to warn 
of the danger of national cultures being ‘swamped’ and 
of the need to defend national identity.

Chapter 3  The making of the twentieth- and twenty-first-century world    75
3.7	 Conclusion
The twentieth century was a period of rapid economic 
and social change over most parts of the world. It was 
also a period when the world seemed to become smaller 
and most regions were gradually drawn into an ever more 
embracing global system. Yet it would be a mistake to 
imagine that this was an uncontested process, or one 
that threatens to bring about a global uniformity. The 
legacy of the twentieth century for the twenty-first is a 
world that is both dynamic and uneven, and therefore 
very uncertain. The rest of this book tries to grapple with 
this uncertainty.
Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter, you should know that:
● Capitalism is inherently dynamic and unstable. It 
was so throughout the twentieth century, and is 
likely to continue to be so in the future.
● The concepts of Fordist or ‘organized’ and Glo-
balized or ‘disorganized’ capitalism are ways of 
trying to make sense of the changes that affected 
capitalist societies during the twentieth century.
● ‘Fordism’ and ‘post-Fordism’ (concerning production 
and consumption) and ‘modernism’ and ‘postmod-
ernism’ (concerning culture) similarly try to make 
sense of twentieth and twenty-first century change. 
No concepts, however, can do justice to the com-
plexity of change during this period.
● Western-style liberal capitalism is only one variant 
of capitalism. It has been challenged in various 
ways in the twentieth century, some of which have 
had long-term consequences for different parts of 
the globe. Future challenges might prove more suc-
cessful than past ones.
● The twentieth century has been an era of 
­nation-states and of nationalism. Towards the end 
of the twentieth and into the twenty-first centuries 
the role of the nation-state seems increasingly 
­challenged by globalization. Nationalism, however, 
may yet flourish as a response to globalization.
● Modernity may not lead to the disappearance of 
traditional cultural practices. The Islamic revival, 
and similar religious revivals across the world, are a 
case in point.
● Despite the view of some that globalization is lead-
ing to the emergence of a global culture, it might 
actually increase the differences between places 
and hence the importance of geography.

already have capital have an inherent advantage over those 
who are dependent on wages only. This situation threatens to 
generate extreme inequalities in wealth, abetting discontent 
and the undermining of democratic values.

Section 2
Population, resources, food,  
the environment and development
Edited by Michael Bradshaw

Writing in 2009, John Beddington, the Chief Sci-
entific Adviser to the UK government, noted that 
by 2030 the world would need to produce 50 per 
cent more food and energy, together with 30 per 
cent more fresh water, while at the same time miti-
gating and adapting to climate change. He warned 
that this combination of challenges threatened 
to create a ‘perfect storm’ of global events. As 
Lester Brown (2011: ix) notes in the preface to 
his book World on the Edge, Jonathon Porritt, then 
Chair of the UK Sustainable Communities Devel-
opment Commission (which was subsequently 
axed by the then Coalition Government), endorsed 
Beddington’s analysis, but suggested that the 
storm was more likely to strike closer to 2020 than 
2030 (Porritt 2009). Recent events might suggest 
that Porritt is right: we seem to be experiencing 
extreme climatic events with increasing frequency 
and energy price volatility now seems the new 
reality. However, there is also reason for optimism: 
in 2015 the Millennium Development goals were 
reset on the basis of significant progress and 
there is hope for a global agreement on climate 
change. The world’s leaders agreed collective 
action at the COP-21 meeting in Paris in late 2015 
to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees. 
While this section does not deal explicitly with 
the issues of climate change and water security, 
which are normally covered elsewhere in a geog-
raphy curriculum, it does deal with the issues 
of population, food, energy, environment and 
development. Thus, it provides an essential back-
ground to understanding many of the issues that 
contribute to the ‘perfect storm’ scenario.
This section makes clear both the scale and the 
complexity of delivering the more sustainable 
approach to development needed in the face of 
storm warnings. The chapters highlight the diver-
sity of problems that exist at the global, interstate 
and local level. In this era of heightened globaliza-
tion, developments in one locale, region or state 
can have global impact. For example, the so-
called ‘developed world’ has achieved high levels 
of consumption, but in doing so has exhausted 
indigenous sources of energy, raw material and 
food supply, making consumers increasingly reli-
ant on global supply chains. The same regions 
now face high production costs, a shortage of 
skilled labour and an increasingly elderly and 
dependent population. Elsewhere in the major-
ity of the world there are regions and states that 
suffer from an absence of economic development 
and an inability to compete in the global market-
place for much needed resources: a problem often 
compounded by the fact that they have to export 
food and natural resources to generate income to 
support the trappings of statehood. All too often, 
local political elites misappropriate the national 
surplus to support their own livings standards 
and safeguard their control over power. Events 
in the Arab world in the spring of 2011 reflect in 
part the peoples’ frustration with this situation. 
At the same time, despite the recent global eco-
nomic crisis, the continuing rapid growth of new 
centres of demand in the emerging economies of, 
for example, Brazil, China and India, highlights 
the dynamic nature of the global system and the 
fact that new sources of demand for resources 
are placing additional stress on the planet’s abil-
ity to support global capitalism. The analysis 
presented in this section suggests that there can 
be no doubt that the storm clouds are gathering 
and that urgent action is needed to change the 
relationship between environment, society and 
development.

Chapter 4

80    Section 2  Population, resources, food, the environment and development
4.1 Introduction
Demographic processes are relevant to almost every topic 
discussed in this book. For example, changes in popula-
tion size and structure can have an impact on the envi-
ronment (including consumption patterns that affect 
climate change) as well as on the economy of countries 
and regions. They may also influence the formation of 
government policies and strategies at all geographical 
levels. Events such as environmental disasters, wars, 
economic shocks and rising inequality can alter a whole 
populations’ life expectancy and lead to significant 
demographic shifts. This chapter draws on recent work 
by the authors (Dorling 2013) to explore the geography 
of global population growth trends and processes. It also 
presents traditional demographic concepts and models 
that were developed to better understand such processes 
(drawing on and updating relevant sections in earlier ver-
sions of this chapter written by John Round 2012). Fur-
ther, we critically reconsider such models in the context 
of a global environment where countries, regions and cit-
ies and their populations are increasingly interdependent 
and at a point when there are growing numbers of people 
moving over national and international borders. We also 
discuss more recent events and demographic transforma-
tions in the context of official population projections that 
suggest that the world population is now stabilizing. The 
chapter then considers case study examples where factors 
such as wars and environmental disasters can be seen to 
be strongly associated with demographic processes and 
can have a significant impact on the population structures 
of many countries and within countries. The chapter 
concludes by providing a summary of the issues discussed 
and also a brief discussion of the impact of income and 
wealth inequality upon life expectancy (which in recent 
years in Europe and the USA have been exacerbated for 
some groups of the population by the implementation of 
austerity measures that disproportionally affect them).
4.2 Geographies of population growth
Before 1851 the world’s population experienced rela-
tively slow growth for most of human history, with 
the exception of the period that is known as the Neo-
lithic revolution (which is thought to have taken place 
around 11,500 years ago). In particular, just before the 
Neolithic revolution, which is also known as the Agri-
cultural Demographic Transition, the global population 
of humans has been estimated to have been around 6 
million people, with a huge amount of error associated 
with that estimate. According to estimates of the United 
Nations Population Division (see Table 4.1) the global 
population in year zero (just over 2,000 years before 
today) was estimated to have been around 300 million. 
However, other estimates of the world population at 
that time vary between 170 and 400 million. Up to the 
end of the first millennium the world’s average popu-
lation growth rate was under 0.1 per cent. During the 
second millennium population growth rates were slow 
and at times of plague and the spread of diseases to the 
new world they were negative, but despite such setbacks 
the global human population reached one billion in 
1820. From then it went up to 1.3 billion by the early 
twentieth century and then rose rapidly to a stagger-
ing 6 billion by 1999. On 31 October 2011 the United 
Nations declared that the global population reached  
7 billion (United Nations 2011). Table 4.1 shows how 
the population changed throughout the last 2,000 years.

thought that Christ was born), the population of what 
is now China, Mongolia and Korea combined was the 
same as the population of the United Kingdom today, 
around 62 million people. Hardly anyone lived in what is 
now the UK, just enough for it to be worth the Romans 
invading (a few years after Christ is thought to have died 
in what is now Israel). The population of what is now 
India, then at the centre of the (known) world, was, at  
78 million, less than that of Germany today. Across all of 
the rest of the planet the remaining 90 million humans were 
unevenly spread out. As can be seen in the first cartogram, 
the largest territories are China (bright green) and India 
(orange), where an estimated 135 million people, more than 
half of the then total global population, were thought to 
live. At that time there were 40 million people in Europe, 
18 million in the Middle East and 11 million in Northern 
Africa, whereas North and South America as well as Asia 
Pacific were very sparsely populated. Generally the colder 
areas in Northern latitudes tended to have lower populations 
whereas the territories that now encompass the Ganges, 
Tigris, Yangtze, Nile and Po rivers were the most populous.

the population in year 1500, the time of the Spanish con-
quest in South America. Although the global population 
The numbers in Table 4.1 and discussion of world popu-
lation growth do not tell us anything about the geographical 
distribution of that growth. We can explore the changing 
geography of the global population with the help of maps 
and cartograms from the Worldmapper project (see Useful 
websites section at end of chapter). In the context of this 
project the world is categorized in 12 Worldmapper regions, 
which are geographically contiguous territories of popu-
lation groups (containing at least 100 million people per 
region) classified by the UN Human Development Index 
and colour coded accordingly, with different shades for 
individual countries. Visit the Worldmapper website for a 
further explanation of the regional definition. Using a rain-
bow scale, ranging from violet for the best-off region (con-
sisting of Japan alone) to dark red for the poorest region

1820 when the world population reached 1 billion. It can 
be argued that this change was the long-term result of the 
encounter between the Old and the New World in 1492, 
which led to a new demographic transition and a new 
human equilibrium as described above, and as will also be 
discussed in more detail in the next sections of this chapter.
The 120-year period between 1851 and 1971 is charted 
in Figure 4.2 and is known as the era of global popu-
lation acceleration. After 1851 the population was not 
just growing, the growth itself was growing! In particu-
lar, the rate of global population growth experienced 
a rapidly increasing trend itself throughout this period 
with the notable exceptions of periods associated with 
the two World Wars and a small number of other sig-
nificant events. The world’s average population annual 
growth rate rose from 0.1 per cent to over 0.5 per cent 
between 1851 and 1900 and went up to over 1 per cent 
in the beginning of the twentieth century, with the 
brief drop to 0.3 per cent during the First World War 
and the influenza pandemic that followed (1918–1919). 
It then went up to 1.3 per cent during the 1920s, before 
falling again to 0.8 in the era of the Great Depres-
sion from 1929 to 1936. It then briefly rose to just over  
1 per cent again in the late 1930s, before falling dramati-
cally during the Second World War. After that first truly 
global war there was a further and rapid acceleration to 
1.8 per cent by the mid-1950s, briefly interrupted in the 
three years of the Great Chinese Famine (between 1958–
1961, when up to 45 million premature deaths occurred) 
and peaking at 2.1 per cent in 1971. The period of global 
population acceleration ended in that year and annual 
growth fell to 1.6 per cent in 1982, jumped to 1.9 per cent 
in 1983 and has been falling continuously since then. It 
should be noted that all these increases are compound 
(the annual increase are in addition to previous growth) 
and therefore a growth of 2 per cent means that the world 
population doubles every 35 years – if that rate continues.
The review and analysis of past trends in population 
growth can be used by demographers in order to try to 
project what the future population growth rates might 
be. In countries without population registers, such as 
the UK and USA, the population census, which records 
demographic and socio-economic information at a sin-
gle point in time and is normally carried out every ten 
years (Rees et al. 2002), is an essential instrument that 
is used in order to obtain reliable estimates of popula-
tion numbers. Censuses were taken in ancient times by 
kings, pharaohs and emperors to estimate the size of the 
population they had to keep suppressed and the num-
ber of soldiers they could raise, as well as to estimate 
their tax base. However, the first modern-day repeated 
census taking took place in Prussia in 1719 and in the 
USA in 1790, whereas the first census in Britain was not 
held until 1801. Census datasets describe the state of the 
nearly doubled from year 1 to year 1500, its geographical 
distribution remained largely the same, with Southern and 
Eastern Asia remaining the most populous world regions. 
It is also interesting to note that at this time the combined 
population of Mexico and Peru was greater than the total 
of the land now labelled as all other American countries. 
This pattern was about to change in the following cen-
turies. In particular, the encounter of the New World in 
1492 was accompanied by the exposure of its inhabitants 
to germs and illnesses to which they did not have immu-
nity. This had a devastating effect upon the indigenous 
population that died far faster from those diseases than 
from the colonial wars and atrocities committed by the 
Old World powers (Diamond 1997; Mann 2011; Dorling 
2013). Back across the Atlantic, the shock was so great 
that the economy of the Old World was transformed; 
riches plundered from the New World turned the social 
order of continents on their head. Suddenly, the underde-
veloped far west of Asia (called Europe) became the cen-
tre of the world; and China was peripheral. Trade flows 
altered, colonization began, the taking of slaves acceler-
ated in Africa and for most people in the world within a 
few centuries everything that was solid had melted into 
air. From continent to continent human populations 
began to multiply rapidly as the established social orders 
were overturned. The first, fastest and most destabilizing 
population explosion was within Europe itself. Africa was 
depopulated through both slavery and 400 years of forced 
migration, mostly to the New World. India was colonized 
(twice), Chinese empires were destroyed, partly through 
the British Empire-orchestrated opiate trade. A nascent 
North American empire was conceived. Between 1500 and 
1900 the global population tripled to 1.5 billion and the 
geographical distribution changed significantly, as shown 
in the fourth map. During this period, which was char-
acterized by imperial rule and territorial expansion, the 
populations of Britain and North America increased more 
than ten-fold. Also, by comparing the second and third 
maps we can observe the devastating impact of slavery 
upon Africa. The fourth map in the series reproduced here 
shows the geography of the global population in 1960, 
when it reached 3 billion. South America has increased its 
proportion of the world’s population living in that conti-
nent rapidly since 1900. In contrast, the Western European 
proportion of the world population began to decline in 
relative terms in 1900 when it was 15 per cent, to 11 per 
cent in 1960 and then 6 per cent in 2000. The fifth car-
togram shown in Figure 4.1 portrays the geographical dis-
tribution of the estimated 6.1 billion global population in 
2000, one year after it reached 6 billion, whereas the sixth 
and last cartogram shows how the 7.32 billion people in 
2015 are geographically distributed in our own time.
As noted above, after a long period of stability there 
was a great demographic change. A key milestone was 

Chapter 4  Demographic transformations    83
rates to have major consequences for population totals 
over a long period. However, it is population ageing that 
will be responsible for most population growth in coming 
decades, but high fertility would alter this. Thus, as­ 
­Figure 4.3 shows, the UN produces a range of predictions 
based on different fertility rates for 2050, with those 
made in 2012 ranging from 8.3 billion to 10.8 billion.
It is instructive to break down the UN estimates 
and predictions by country and world regions. One 
of the classifications used by the UN to classify world 
regions and countries is that of ‘more developed coun-
tries’ or ‘less developed countries’ which (as discussed in 
­Chapter 8) is problematic; nonetheless these terms are 
used in this chapter (as well as other socio-economic 
and political classifications), as they are routinely and 
widely employed by organizations such as the UN and 
the World Bank. Figure 4.4 shows the official UN esti-
mated past and projected future growth rates in so-called 
‘more developed’ and ‘less developed’ countries. As can 
be seen, population size in the ‘more developed coun-
tries’ has remained relatively stable since the late 1950s, 
at around 1 billion. In contrast, the total population of 
the ‘less developed countries’ has increased rapidly 
from approximately 1 billion to 5 billion since 1950.
This difference in growth rates is depicted starkly in 
Figure 4.4, which shows that the rates of population 
growth in less developed regions, although declining 
rapidly, will continue to be far above those in more 
whole national population and are extremely relevant for 
the analysis of a wide range of socio-economic issues 
and related policies. In addition to the census there is 
an increasingly wide range of administrative and private 
sector sources of suitable socio-economic data that can 
be used for demographic research.
The data collected from censuses of populations can 
be used in order to provide estimates of population in the 
past as well as projections into the future. In particular, 
once a census is taken, it is possible to calculate birth and 
death rates and once these rates are calculated it becomes 
possible to project population numbers both backwards 
and forwards in time, including estimates of future and 
past migration flows.
On the basis of the past demographic trends reviewed 
above it is expected that in coming decades the global 
population growth rates will continue to decline, as they 
have for the last four decades. In particular, the United 
Nations predicts a fall in growth rates to below 1 per 
cent by around 2020, declining further thereafter to  
0.3 per cent by 2050 (which will be the lowest growth 
level recorded since the mid-eighteenth century). How-
ever, even these more modest growth rates will see the 
world’s population grow by over 35 million a year until 
2050. Even such slowed growth results in an overall popu-
lation of 9.5 billion, 2.5 billion more than present. Given 
the compound nature of population growth, as we shall 
see below, it takes only small changes in fertility/death

above those in ‘more developed regions’ for the foresee-
able future.
Even within the category of ‘less developed’ there are 
still further variations, the reasons for which will become 
more apparent below. The 48 least developed countries, 
according to UN data, experienced the greatest increases 
in population growth. This group only held 8 per cent of 
the world’s population in 1950 but in the subsequent half-
century, as a result of their rapid population growth, they 
developed regions for the foreseeable future. The most 
striking aspect of the geography of population change 
is how population size in the ‘more developed countries’ 
has remained relatively stable since the late 1950s, at 
around 1 billion. In contrast, the total population of 
the ‘less developed countries’ has increased rapidly from 
approximately 1 billion to 6 billion since 1950. Also, 
as can be seen in Figure 4.4, the rates of population 
growth in ‘less developed regions’ are projected to be far

4.3 Geographies of changing birth and 
death rates and the demographic 
transition model
To explain changes in population growth rates demog-
raphers often use the demographic transition model. 
According to this model there are five stages through 
which most countries have passed in their demographic 
history. Figure 4.5 summarizes the model and shows the 
stages (see Lee 2003 for an overview of its development). 
During stage one, health care is rudimentary and many 
people die from what are now easily treatable diseases, 
leading to very high crude death rates (CDR – deaths per 
1000 people). Birth rates (CBR – births per 1000 people) 
were also high as large families were the norm, possibly as 
insurance against uncertainty and to ensure that parents 
will have support when they can no longer work. With 
birth and death rates relatively equal, overall population 
size does not increase dramatically during this stage.
Countries move to stage two, as their political, economic 
and social organization evolves and leads to the develop-
ment of health care and sanitation systems, so that fewer 
people die from easily preventable diseases. However, there 
is usually a period during which birth rates remain high. 
This might be due to a delayed adjustment to the new 
contributed around 15 per cent of the overall global growth. 
Such differences in population growth rates have altered the 
relative distribution of the world’s population. For exam-
ple, the ‘more developed’ countries in 1950 combined to 
provide approximately a third of the world’s population. 
By 2010 this had fallen to around 18 per cent (this global 
shift is discussed in Chapter 5 in relation to global energy 
demand and carbon emissions). As Table 4.2 shows, this 
has meant that significant changes have occurred in over-
all population share by region. Consequently, as Table 4.2 
demonstrates, Europe’s share of the world’s population fell 
from approximately a quarter to around an eighth between 
1900 and 2000, with Africa contrasting most as the big-
gest continental gainer in percentage terms. What is most 
significant here is how this has happened, with most of the 
changes taking place since 1950.
By 2050 Europe’s share of the world’s population is 
likely to have fallen to 7 per cent, while Africa’s share is 
expected to be nearly three times that. Over the period 
2003–2050 Africa’s population is projected to grow by 
just under 1 billion people, representing over one-third of 
all global growth in humanity (36.4 per cent) compared to 
only one-sixth (16.6 per cent) for 1950–2003. Meanwhile, 
Asia seems destined to remain the main contributor in 
absolute terms, adding a further 1.4 billion up to 2050, 
but this is a marked reduction in the pace of growth com-
pared to its 2.4 billion gain between 1950 and 2003.

From these figures we can see that, in less developed 
countries, from the middle of the previous century death 
rates fell dramatically as health care began to improve. How-
ever, birth rates, although declining, did not converge with 
death rates, resulting in a rapid increase in the rate of natural 
situation, or because economic growth sees an increasing 
demand for family labour. This gap between death and 
birth rates results in an increasing population. As death 
rates can fall rapidly this can often cause a rapid rise in pop-
ulation growth. Figure 4.6 demonstrates how this occurs.

population growth. More developed countries have entered 
the third stage of the demographic transition model where 
birth and death rates converge. Birth rates have fallen rapidly 
for a combination of reasons, including the following:
● The setting up of systems of social security and pension 
systems meaning that many parents no longer have to 
rely on their children for support during old age.
●	 Increased social and economic choices for women, 
gained by women; these include improving opportuni-
ties in the workplace, much greater levels of participa-
tion in higher education than in previous generations 
and the availability of reliable contraception.
●	 Cultural attitudes towards large families have changed 
so that rather than being the norm, having many chil-
dren is seen as unusual and an increasing number of 
women are deciding not to have children at all.
●	 Increasing levels of divorce and single parent families 
means that large families are less likely. It is also far 
more accepted today to be single for much or all of 
your life and to be in a same sex relationship, which 
tends to result in fewer births.
●	 A rapid increase in the average age of first birth. If the 
first birth is delayed then a large family is less likely.
A combination of these factors has resulted in a dramatic 
fall in global fertility rates. In the 1960s fertility rates aver-
aged around 5 children per woman, but have now fallen to 
below half that figure. The fertility rate today worldwide 
ranges from 1.2 children per woman in the Republic of 
Korea to 7.6 in Niger (World Bank 2015a), and the world 
average fertility rate is now estimated to be 2.5.
In Asia and South America the average fertility rate 
is still rapidly falling and in almost all cases is below 
2.5 children per couple if not below 2.1. In sub-Saharan 
Africa the majority of countries currently have fertility 
rates of above 3 or in a few cases 4, and many are begin-
ning to see fertility decline more quickly than before.

ing up to 2010 and are predicted to continue to fall. They

from 0.16 per cent to 0.08 per cent and are now negative 
(as we write in 2015); in Italy, growth of 0.2 per cent in 
2000 has declined so fast that it became a fall of 0.03 per 
cent even as early as 2009, in Germany a 0.14 per cent rise 
turned into a fall of 0.5 per cent and in Japan a 0.19 per 
cent rise became, in just 10 years, a fall of 0.16 per cent, all 
this in the years 2000 to 2009. All this before the greatest 
economic slump since 1929 set in with its rapid effects on 
curtailing fertility even more quickly. United Nations data 
in 2015 still refers to estimates revised in 2012. As yet we 
do not have a full picture of how global economic reces-
sion has impacted on fertility and mortality. By the time 
you read this we should know. So if you want to know 
what has happened, look for updates at: http://esa.un.org/
unpd/wpp/index.htm.
In revised biological theories of evolution, the concept 
of the punctuated equilibrium is used to describe whole 
sets of species suddenly dying out and new ones emerg-
ing. This is usually following a period of general stability 
before another period of quiescence (which means stabil-
ity, quiet and stillness) establishes. In general there is equi-
librium. All that changes during the quiescence are the 
mechanisms that tend to operate to preserve the status 
quo, to bring events back into line. However, occasionally 
and very rarely, that equilibrium is punctured and there 
is great and rapid change. That is what has happened 
to human beings: there has been a rapid change in our 
numbers since 1492, a change so great that it has only 
been seen once before – a very long time ago.
Many millennia ago the ecology of interacting groups 
of humans evolved after the Neolithic revolution, itself 
a great puncturing, to become what, in 1990s terminol-
ogy, was called a self-organized critical steady state; in 
this case a state of gently rising population numbers 
interspersed with the occasional plague or famine. How-
ever, when one particular group of humans adapts, and 
jumps across some barrier, such as the Atlantic Ocean, 
that group mutates to a different kind of human society, 
and this eventually affects all other human groups on the 
planet. All their equilibria are punctured.
At first the effects of humans regularly crossing the 
Atlantic were hardly noticeable, if you just considered 
average global statistics. The World’s population had 
fallen slightly in the years immediately after 1492 as 
deaths in the Americas spread with the introduction of 
Old World germs and diseases. However, globally, annual 
population growth rates rose to a quarter of a percent-
age a year from 1500 to 1600, next falling to just 0.08 
per cent on average from 1600 to 1700, but then rising to 
just under half a percentage growth a year, on average, 
between 1700 and 1850, after which the puncturing of the 
equilibrium finally resulted in all human groups in every 
continent growing quickly.
are now well below the population replacement rate of 
2.1 (the minimum needed for a population not to decline 
over the long term) in Europe and North America; and 
they are projected to reach that level in most regions in 
the world before 2100. The highest fertility predicted by 
the UNPD for 2100 is 2.13 children per couple in Africa 
(as a whole). The lowest is 1.93 (which is almost certainly 
too high an estimate). Many demographers suspect that 
the lowest rates will be much lower than 1.93 simply 
because they are lower already.
4.4 Global population growth  
and punctuated equilibrium
The demographic transition model can help with the anal-
ysis and understanding of past trends and demographic 
processes. However, one of its key limitations is that it 
does not take into account the inter-dependencies of cities, 
regions and countries, which need to be considered when 
analyzing past and future world population growth. In 
this section we draw on recent relevant work presenting an 
alternative approach to the analysis of global population 
growth, adapting punctuated equilibrium ideas from biol-
ogy. Discussing further and revisiting the graph shown in 
Figure 4.2 can illustrate this alternative and more sophis-
ticated model. Figure 4.8 shows an extended version of 
that graph, adding the total population numbers as well as 
projections to 2100. The period from 1851 to 1971 can be 
described as an era of global population acceleration (bar-
ring the four epochal events annotated in both figures). 
The year 1851 can be described as a global minimum for 
recent population growth. Looking at our recent past, in 
Figure 4.8, in relation to what our near future is projected 
to be, we can clearly see that we have been living through 
a major demographic transformation. However, global 
population change started to decelerate in 1971 and has 
continued unabated since then. Currently the population 
growth (thin) line in Figure 4.8 is still dropping almost as 
quickly as it did in the 30 years up to 2000, although you 
can see a slight ‘hump’ of baby boom just around 2010 if 
you look carefully. Annual global population growth was 
1.27 per cent in the year to 2000; it fell to 1.03 per cent 
by the year to 2009. That is a continuous rapid decline in 
growth rates. It is made up of many slightly greater decel-
erations and a few slower ones (including the 2010 mini 
baby boom). The Netherlands saw growth rates fall from 
0.67 per cent to 0.42 per cent over the same period, the 
United Kingdom 0.39 per cent to 0.28 per cent (although 
growth there has been rising in very recent years but only 
due to a mini baby boom among the children of recently 
arriving migrants), in Spain population growth rates fell

led to so many of those in power realizing that they 
could not continue to treat others beneath them almost 
as slaves.
The nineteenth-century population acceleration could 
also partly be related to the understanding and control 
of diseases stemming from overcrowding, poverty and 
unsanitary living, as well as the introduction of condoms 
(which became widely popular in North America in the 
1840s before they were widely used in the UK). It is not 
impossible that just as it took a great deal of birth con-
trol to later put on the brakes, just a little birth control 
had earlier enabled the conditions for some (then) more 
sustainable growth to become established.
Different groups are influenced most strikingly by 
events outside of their control at different times. For 
example, the populations of the Americas were deci-
mated many times over; from shortly after that first mod-
ern Atlantic crossing was made.
It is hard to tell what occurred around 1851 to cause 
that date to be the global minimum for recent popula-
tion growth. It may well have been a combination of fac-
tors. Some may have been technological, including the 
slow and benign spread of electricity that aided people 
to read and learn after dark. Some were political, such 
as the immediate and dramatic effects of the 1848 year 
of revolution spreading across Europe, and how that

limit their numbers once the great change began in 1851 
and there could have been demographic developments 
similar to the predictions and consistent with the views 
(which were proven completely wrong and unjustified, 
especially about future population growth) of Reverend 
Thomas Malthus who, in his Essay on the Principle of 
Population (published in 1798), forecast a never-ending 
cycle of population growth, war and famine.
But other factors mattered: vaccination, student upris-
ing, limits to growth theory, and – perhaps of far more 
importance than all of these – women’s emancipation. 
What all these have in common is education. And educa-
tion was not just widespread by the 1970s; it was about 
to boom. In particular, it can be argued that the punctu-
ated equilibrium settling back down again to ordinary 
equilibrium is occurring through our collective learning. 
By 1995, a majority of working-age people in the world, 
those aged 15–64, had been educated to secondary level. 
Less than a third had been so educated in 1970. It was 
only in 2007 that it became clear just how quickly edu-
cational improvements were spreading, and that these 
figures could be confirmed as changing so quickly (Lutz 
et al. 2007 – see Figure 4.9). This global educational 
improvement is remarkable and to date shows no signs 
of slowing down, despite, or perhaps because of, the 
beginnings of the deceleration in population numbers. 
As people all around the world have far fewer children, 
The discussion above of possible reasons for the 
acceleration that began in 1851 and had its source 
as early as 1492 provides just one of many possible 
explanatory frameworks for demographic transforma-
tions. Similarly, we can consider possible reasons that 
might have caused the slowdown in 1971 that now looks 
as if this was not just another of those events brought 
on by a catastrophe (as annotated in Figure 4.8), but 
what we now see clearly as a turning point. Reasons 
for our current slowdown can include the gradual and 
benign spread and multiplication of vaccines that has 
greatly reduced infant mortality, to the immediate and 
dramatic effects of the 1968 uprising across the rich 
world and that led to so many in power coming to see 
that there were limits to endless growth (it is notable 
that the Club of Rome was formed that year). In addi-
tion, other potential very important reasons include the 
work that was done that resulted in understanding and 
spreading education, especially to women, the spreading 
by word of mouth of the invention and availability of 
the contraceptive pill, widespread use of which began 
in North America in the 1960s, through to seeing, for 
the first time, the earth from the moon in 1969. There 
are numerous possibilities for what it was that caused 
the tide to turn shortly after 1968. It is highly likely that 
without effective and widespread new forms of con-
traception, human beings would not have managed to

example is provided by South Korea. In the 1960s, based 
on historical growth data, the economic outlook would 
have been modest, but projections of its future educa-
tional attainment profile may have indicated that it was 
about to enter a window of opportunity combining high 
qualifications with low dependency ratios’(Samir et al. 
2010). When the rapid current uptake in educational 
opportunities is taken into account, then an even more 
rapid future population slowdown would appear yet 
more likely in both India and China. Women in particular 
tend to have fewer children when educated to secondary 
level, and fewer still if university educated. Figure 4.10 
more and more work harder to ensure that their offspring 
are better educated than they were.
A recent projection (Samir et al. 2010) of educational 
changes has suggested that future trends for India and 
China will result in the numbers in any form of education 
in India not peaking until 2050, but the absolute numbers 
in various categories of learning falling in China from 
2020 onwards. This will occur as the numbers of young 
people most likely to attend educational institutions 
continues to fall there even as the proportion attending 
higher education rises. The report accompanying the pro-
jection ends with the following salutary note: ‘A historical

the number of borders tends to remain fixed. Accord-
ing to recent data from the World Bank and the United 
Nations, approximately 3 per cent of the global popula-
tion (213 million people) in 2010 lived in a country dif-
ferent from their country of birth. This compares to 2.4 
per cent (72 million) of the total global population having 
permanently crossed a border in 1960. Table 4.3 shows 
the trends from 1960 to 2010 for the world as well as 
selected major regions and political and socio-economic 
groupings, whereas Figure 4.11 shows the changes over 
this period of 50 years for world regions by income level 
(as classified by the World Bank).
As can be seen in Figure 4.11, the number of immi-
grant residents as a percentage of total population tends 
to be higher in more affluent countries with nearly 12 per 
cent of the population in the high income countries (as 
classified by the World Bank) born abroad (in 1960 it was 
3.9 per cent). This can be attributed to ‘pull factors’ in 
such countries such as better job opportunities or higher 
pay rates, but it should also be noted that immigrants 
shows the highest level of education achieved or projected 
to be achieved by adults in India and China. Children are 
not included in these figures. Even in countries as affluent 
as the United States, educational changes are still linked 
to fertility changes.
4.5 Migration and population change
A world in which fertility’s contribution to population 
growth is declining will see future population change 
within any region and country being attributed far more 
often to migration. In addition, there is an increasing 
movement of people between regions and countries so 
these patterns are changing. As the world urbanizes, more 
will move more often and further. Far more often than 
before those moves will be over international borders, 
simply because it has become easier to move slightly 
longer distances (and to video-call back home), while

well as economic migrants, as is the case with the recent 
events in the Mediterranean sea, which is often seen as 
a failure of immigration control rather than an oppor-
tunity to celebrate humanity, offering a better future to 
those in need and at the same time benefiting European 
countries with their rapidly ageing populations (see also 
Case study 4.3 and Section 4.8).
It should also be noted that it is more sustainable to 
build up population where there is already infrastructure, 
an abundant water supply, flat land and a demand for 
new labour, as compared to where many of these things 
are lacking. For existing cities that see their populations 
expanding often the only way is up, and more apartments 
are the future. For example, it would make little sense for 
Europe and Japan to depopulate. If migration to them from 
poorer areas were to increase, their population growth 
themselves contribute to the economic growth and pros-
perity of the destination countries. And destination 
countries often actually desperately need immigrants 
to replace the babies that have not been born as fertility 
declined rapidly two or three decades earlier. However, 
this is often an unfair trade. In particular, immigrants 
bring in skills but have been educated at the expense of 
the taxpayer in their home country. This is the case even 
with those who may be unskilled or have no formal educa-
tion qualifications, as when they are employed they paid 
contributions to social insurance and pension schemes 
and in many cases they are doing jobs that existing resi-
dents do not want to do. Migrants also bring benefits in  
non-monetary ways that are more difficult to quantify, 
as they expose their new country to different cultures.
Overall, there needs to be a change of thinking 
towards understanding that just as gaining migrants 
is usually positive, for the migrant leaving a country is 
often a positive move too. In particular, the conditions in 
destination counties are generally good and this applies 
to both poorer countries and within the richer world. 
The large majority of migration in the world occurs 
where the large majority of people are, in the poorer 
areas of the world. Often called south–south migration, 
this is when people leave one country within a continent 
such as Africa to move to another, usually neighbouring, 
country. Such moves are can be viewed as problematic: 
‘The assessment of development progress is based on 
measurements within national boundaries. The emigra-
tion of people is still seen as a symptom of develop-
ment failure’ (Bakewell 2011). Similarly, emigration to 
the rich world is often seen as a failure of immigration 
control, rather than a success story of mass human 
endeavour. This also applies to situations where people 
are forced to leave their homes and become refugees as

impact can be extremely positive, especially when societies 
are properly prepared to welcome them. For more discus-
sion, arguments and examples of why and how migration 
is beneficial to host countries see Rowe (2014).
4.6 Geographies of mortality  
and life expectancy
One of the key messages of the discussion above is 
that there has been a significant improvement of life 
expectancy across the world over the past 200 years and 
that unless there is a terrible disaster, a new plague or 
widespread famine, examples of where whole countries 
experience life expectancy below 50 years should soon 
would help slow down total world population growth 
even faster than it is already slowing, possibly resulting in 
a global population which never exceeds 9 billion (because 
fertility falls faster than predicted). It should also be noted 
that when people move countries they, or their children, 
tend to quickly adopt the fertility rates of the places they 
are moving to. However, these facts tend to be overlooked 
in debates about migration in developed countries and 
especially by the tabloid press that publish misleading and 
alarming stories about ‘immigrants taking our houses, our 
school places and our hospital beds’ (Rowe 2014) and by 
far-right political parties (especially in Europe) which – just 
as their fascist forebears did – use immigrants and people 
seen as different (such as the Jews) as a scapegoat, blam-
ing them for the rise of unemployment and representing 
them as a threat, when in fact, as argued above, the overall

already relatively high, such as Western Europe and 
North America. For instance, life expectancy in North 
America went up from 69.9 to 79.1 years and in coun-
tries that now make up the European Union it went up 
from 69.3 to 80.4 years. Worldwide the increase was 18.5 
years between 1960 and 2013. However, life expectancy 
remains stubbornly low in the ‘least developed’ countries 
and especially in sub-Saharan African countries, where 
HIV/AIDS has been a major cause of death. In particu-
lar, in several of these countries there was no change in 
life expectancy or a decline (also see discussion in the 
next section). Other causes of significant declines in life 
expectancy include major environmental disasters such 
as the recent earthquake in Nepal but also armed con-
flict, such as the 1990s genocide in Rwanda, or the more 
recent wars in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Sudan.
There is also a high but rapidly falling infant mor-
tality rate in the least developed regions: whereas the 
IMR for the period 2005–10 was just over 4 per 1,000 
live births in North America, most of Europe and Aus-
tralia/New Zealand, it averages 22 in Latin America, 56 
in south-central Asia and 80 in sub-Saharan Africa (also 
see ­Figure 4.13). It was one of the United Nation’s Mil-
lennium ­Development Goals to reduce by two-thirds the 
mortality rate among children under five (www.undp.org) 
(see Case study 4.1).
be relegated to the historical record, along with exam-
ples of countries where the average couple has four or 
five children.
According to the most recent data from the World 
Bank, the global population life expectancy at birth in 
2013 was 71 years. Figure 4.12 shows the trends from 
1960–2013 for world regions (using geographic, ­economic 
and political criteria) as well as for Japan and Sierra 
Leone, which are the countries with the highest and low-
est life expectancy in 2013 respectively.
There has been a significant increase in life expec-
tancy in most regions, although the rates of increase vary 
considerably between the different categories of coun-
tries as well as over different time periods. In particular, 
there was significant progress in the 1960s and 1970s in 
all countries. The rates of increase were higher in coun-
tries and regions where they were already extremely low. 
For example, as seen in Figure 4.12, life expectancy in 
sub-Saharan African countries went up from 40.2 years 
in 1960 to 56.9 in 2013. In addition, according to data 
from the World Bank (2015c), life expectancy in the 
world region of Middle East and North Africa went up 
from 46.6 in 1960 to 72.4 in 2013. In the same period the 
increase for countries in East Asia and the Pacific went 
up from 48 to 74.9 years. There were smaller increases 
in higher income countries where life expectancy was

(1939–1945); and the Great Chinese Famine (1958–61). 
These events significantly affected global life expectancy 
and trends in fertility, mortality and migration. Although, 
there have been no similar events since the Great Chi-
nese Famine that so massively affected global population 
growth, there have been a number of terrible disasters 
and wars that had a massive impact on the life chances 
and demographic processes of particular world regions 
and countries. For example, as discussed in the previous 
section, most of the countries in the world that expe-
rienced a decline in life expectancy over the past few 
decades were in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV/AIDS 
4.7 The demographic impact and 
geography of disease, natural 
disasters and wars
As discussed in the beginning of this chapter (see 
­Figure 4.5) the era of global population acceleration 
between 1851–1971 was interrupted by four major events: 
the First World War through to the end of the influenza 
pandemic (1914–19); the economic crash of 1929 through 
to the end of depression in 1936; the Second World War 
Case study 4.1
United Nation’s Millennium 
Development Goal number 4: reduce 
by two-thirds the mortality rate among 
children under 5
The Millennium Development Goals are eight develop-
ment objectives that were set to be achieved by the 
end of 2015 (see discussion in Chapter 8). They were 
adopted by 189 nations at the UN Millennium Sum-
mit in September 2000 (see www.undp.org/mdg for a 
full overview of the goals). Goal number 4 aimed to 
reduce by two-thirds the mortality rate among children 
under 5.
Progress was to be measured by the following indica-
tors: under-5 mortality rate; infant mortality rate; and the 
proportion of one-year-old children immunized against 
measles. UN data shows, however, that in the first four 
years of the scheme little progress had been made in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Few countries there saw infant 
mortality decrease significantly and some had even 
seen rates increase. Some countries had experienced a 
rise in immunization rates but this is not universal to the 
region (for an excellent database on Millennium Devel-
opment Goal data go to http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg). 
Elsewhere though there had been great progress, but 
these achievements was averaged down by the deaths 
of so many very small children in the very worse-off 
places.
Overall, according to the latest Millennium Develop-
ment Goals Reports by the UN (2014a) and another 
report by UNICEF (2014), although there has been 
considerable progress, the world was still falling short of 
the MDG child mortality target by 2014. In particular, it is 
noted that there has been major progress in improving 
child survival with the under-five mortality rate declining 
by almost half since 1990 (but not yet to two-thirds 
of that rate). In addition, the rate at which under-five 
mortality is declining has more than tripled during the 
same period, with Eastern and Southern Africa having 
the highest annual rate of reduction in the world once 
East Asia and the Pacific are excluded from the com-
parisons. It is also noted that under-five mortality is fall-
ing among the poorest children. However, the progress 
has been insufficient to meet goal number 4 by the end 
of 2015 and if current trends continue the target will 
only be reached by 2026, 11 years behind schedule. 
Further, without rapid increases in funding to prevent 
easily preventable child deaths, the UN estimates that 
in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa the goals will not 
be reached until 2115. Despite the progress the toll of 
under-five deaths over the past two decades is stagger-
ing, as 223 million children worldwide died before their 
fifth birthday during that period. Most of these deaths 
continue to occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. 
As pointed out in by UNICEF (2014):
Sub-Saharan Africa continues to shoulder the greatest 
burden: 1 in 11 children born there still die before 
age 5, nearly 15 times the average in high-income 
countries (1 in 159). The recent momentum achieved 
in sub-Saharan Africa needs to be sustained and 
accelerated.
With regards to the causes of under-five deaths, it is 
noted that:
although under-five deaths from leading infectious 
diseases have declined significantly, pneumonia, diar-
rhoea and malaria are still the main killers of under-
fives. In 2013, pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria 
caused about one third of all under-five deaths. Impor-
tantly, neonatal deaths account for 44 per cent of all 
under-five deaths.

population). The figures will not be that dissimilar today, 
if you are reading the book shortly after its publication.
Figure 4.14 shows the trends in life expectancy in a 
number of selected countries that have experienced 
very high HIV/AIDS prevalence rates and numbers of 
deaths. During the 1970s and 1980s there were significant 
improvements of health care and life expectancy across 
the world (including the least developed regions) due to 
the successful introduction of sustained programmes 
curbing easily preventable diseases. For example, life 
expectancy in Botswana rose to approximately 65 by the 
mid-1980s and it was predicted that it would have reached 
69 by 2011, but for HIV/AIDS. Instead, in 2011 male life 
expectancy was 55. In Swaziland life expectancy is now 
46; without HIV/AIDS it is estimated that it would be 
64. As Figure 4.14 shows, there have been dramatic falls 
in life expectancy throughout the period when the HIV/
AIDS epidemic affected each of these countries. However, 
there has been a gradual improvement in the more recent 
years for some countries that can be attributed to the use 
of antiretrovirals and increased education levels about the 
transmission of HIV and the increased use of condoms, 
despite the attempts of some religious groups to stop this.
has been a major cause of death, despite the fact that 
the AIDS pandemic has been subsiding in recent years. 
According to the World Health Organization there were 
an estimated 1.5 million deaths from AIDS in the year 
2013 alone. This cause of death is now declining in 
importance. These were 22 per cent fewer deaths in 2013 
than in 2009 and 35 per cent fewer than the peak year of 
2005 (World Health Organization 2011). However, over 
two-thirds (1.1 million) of these deaths were in Africa 
(World Health Organization 2014). Soon more people 
will die each year in road crashes than from HIV/AIDS. 
That, of course, is not much cause for celebration. But 
perhaps then we will begin to treat so many avoidable 
deaths from car crashes worldwide as seriously as we 
view pandemics?
According to UNICEF (2013) and UNAIDS (2010) 
there were then nine countries with HIV prevalence 
rates of over 10 per cent and the worst affected country 
at that time was Swaziland, which had the highest rate 
in the world (26 per cent), followed by Botswana (23.4 
per cent), whereas in terms of absolute numbers South 
Africa was home to the world’s largest epidemic with 5.6 
million people living with HIV (17.3 per cent of its total

HIV/AIDS
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a virus that 
can develop into AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency 
Syndrome). This syndrome leads to the failure of the 
immune system, making minor infections life threat-
ening. There is currently no cure for this disease. 
The virus is most commonly passed on by sexual 
contact and the sharing of infected needles and can 
also be transmitted during pregnancy and through

World demography is still altered by several major 
infectious diseases. Malaria is another disease that has 
significantly affected life expectancy in several Afri-
can countries. In 2003 there were an estimated 110 
million deaths from Malaria and 92 per cent of them 
were recorded in Africa, with the rest mainly in Asia 
Pacific and Southern Asia. Deaths from Malaria when 
estimated globally are now found to be falling (United 
Nations 2014b).
Other possible causes of significant declines in life 
expectancy, as well as disease, include human mobility 
and displacement especially following major environ-
mental disasters including epidemics, droughts, famines, 
earthquakes, volcanoes, storms, fires and events caused 
by accidents or indirectly caused by wars. There is a 
very uneven geography of such deaths that reflects the 
relative vulnerability of the population (Affifi and Jäger 
2010). With regards to the people affected by disaster and 
requiring external assistance (such as shelter, water, sani-
tation, medication and food) to survive, 43 per cent were 
in Southern Asia, 41 per cent in Eastern Asia and 5 per 
cent in Southern Africa (Worldmapper 2015a).
breastfeeding. While the scale of the pandemic is 
clear, the origins of HIV/AIDS are not easily identifi-
able. There are many competing theories as to why 
and where the disease began, but it first came to the 
attention of the medical profession in the early 1980s 
when groups of patients started to suffer from diseases 
rarely seen within their age group and which were 
extremely resistant to treatment (see www.avert.org or 
www.unaids.org for further details). By the mid-1980s 
the disease was named, tests became available and 
public awareness campaigns on how to avoid infection 
began. Despite this, the number of people becoming 
infected grew rapidly. One of the main causes of this 
is the fact that HIV is asymptomatic and can be carried 
for many years before AIDS develops, therefore a car-
rier can infect many other people before they become ill 
themselves.
Today HIV/AIDS affects every country in the world. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 78 million 
people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 
39 million people have died of HIV. WHO estimates that 
globally, 35.0 million people were living with HIV at the 
end of 2013. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region of the 
world worst affected with nearly 1 in every 20 adults 
living with HIV and accounting for nearly 71 per cent of 
the people living with HIV worldwide.
While there is no cure there are drugs, known as 
antiretrovirals, that can slow down the progression of 
the disease. This can greatly improve the health and life 
expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS and they can 
block the transmission of the virus from mother to child. 
According to a UNAIDS report antiretroviral therapy 
averted 5.5 million deaths in low and middle-income 
countries from the peak in 1995 until 2012 (UNAIDS 
2013). However, these drugs are not a cure and if treat-
ment is missed or a patient develops resistance to the 
drug then the disease reverts to its normal course. Also, 
due to the cost of the drugs many people in low and 
middle-income countries have not been able to access 
them at all. At the beginning of the 21st century there 
were very few people in low and middle-income coun-
tries with access to HIV treatment. This was to some 
extent due to the very high prices of antiretroviral drugs 
and the international patents that stopped them from 
being manufactured at cheaper prices. However, since 
2001 drug manufacturers in developing countries began 
to manufacture generic drugs under special terms in 
international trade law and this resulted in a significant 
reduction in price, enabling the expansion of treatment 
on a global scale (AVERT 2014). According to UNAIDS 
the cost of first-line antiretroviral therapy in some 
low- and middle-income countries has been reduced 
to around US$140 per person per year by 2013, from 
US$10,000 per person per year which was the esti-
mated cost in the mid-1990s.
In late 2006 UNAIDS estimated that out of over 7 
million people living with HIV in these countries less 
than 2 million had access to antiretroviral medication. 
In 2012 this number was estimated to be 9.7 million 
and there was an overall 40-fold increase in access to 
antiretroviral therapy between 2002–2012 (UNAIDS 
2013). In addition, UNAIDS estimated that there was 
an overall 33 per cent decrease in new HIV infections 
between 2001 and 2012 and a 29 per cent decrease in 
AIDS related deaths between 2005 and 2012. However, 
in many sub-Saharan African countries less than half of 
expectant mothers with HIV receive the medication they 
require to reduce the risk of transmission to their child. 
While there is still the will to increase access to medica-
tion, the current prolonged global economic downturn 
(as we write in 2015) means that even though the cost 
of the drugs continues to fall many governments are 
struggling to purchase them in sufficient quantities or to 
maintain the health care infrastructure needed for their 
effective delivery. Overall, UNAIDS highlights that there 
has been remarkable progress over the last decade, but 
also that significant challenges remain.

Chapter 4  Demographic transformations    99
The ability of countries to deal with disasters and to 
minimize the loss of human life heavily depends on the 
local infrastructure, which includes good communica-
tions and early warning systems and adequate planning 
as well as the readiness of the international community 
to provide support. Again, there is an uneven geography 
of the potential of countries and regions to address the 
impact of disasters, leading to higher number of deaths 
in some areas that could have been prevented (e.g. see 
Worldmapper 2015b). For instance, the 2015 earthquake 
in Nepal had a devastating effect upon the country’s 
population and economy and there was an urgent and 
very strong need for international assistance. In contrast, 
Japan was in a much better position to deal with the 
Great Eastern Earthquake and tsunami disaster in 2011 
with minimum international assistance.
It is also increasingly argued that natural disasters are 
now more and more likely to be the result of ­climate 
change and there is a great amassing of evidence in rela-
tion to the processes at play and mitigating the environ-
mental impact that human activity has on the planet. At 
the same time there are increased calls for action from 
humanitarian agencies such as the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 
Such agencies are increasingly developing climate-change 
scenarios that envisage massive environmental disasters 
which would result in direct or indirect human displace-
ment (and environmental migration, which includes 
climate migration) including hydro-meteorological dis-
asters (flooding, hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, mud-
slides etc.), environmental degradation and slow onset 
disaster (e.g. reduction of water availability, desertifi-
cation, recurrent flooding), the possibility of ‘sinking’ 
small states and violent conflict triggered by a decrease 
in essential resources (such as water, land, food) owing to 
climate change (UNHCR 2014). UNCHR have already 
been involved in operations aimed at mitigating the 
impact of disasters for which there are strong reasons to 
believe are caused by climate change, such as the flood-
ing of Somali refugee camps in north-eastern Kenya in 
November 2007 resulting in 12,000 refugees losing their 
shelters and displacing another 80,000 (UNHCR 2014).
Related to climate change is the increased use of cars 
for commuting in the world and traffic – one of the 
causes of death expected to rise (Dorling 2011). Accord-
ing to the latest data from the World Health Organi-
zation there were 1.24 million deaths from road traffic 
accidents in 2010.
After road crashes the next highest source of trau-
matic death is war. War has a huge impact on the 
demographic structure, life expectancy and migration 
patterns of whole countries and regions. Ever since the 
Second World War there has been no military conflict 
that would have such an impact on global population 
growth. However, since then there have been a number 
of smaller wars and armed conflicts resulting in more 
than 50 million deaths, and these have had a devastating 
effect on the populations of particular countries and 
world regions. Figure 4.15 shows the geographical dis-
tribution of deaths resulting from wars between 1945 
and 2000. China, Vietnam and the Democratic Republic 
of Congo and Sudan had the highest number of war

deaths during this period, whereas there were very few 
war deaths affecting the populations of Japan, Western 
Europe and North America. There were relatively few 
war deaths in Eastern Europe (including the wars in for-
mer Yugoslavia) and South America (mainly in Bolivia, 
Colombia and Guatemala).
Figure 4.16 shows the annual changes in life expec-
tancy of five selected countries affected by war and armed 
conflict. War and other disasters result in population 
displacement and forced migration, which has a demo-
graphic and socio-economic impact on the structure of 
regions and countries that are the destinations of immi-
grants (see Case study 4.3).

Forced displacement, migration and 
deaths in the Mediterranean Sea
The number of refugees caused by persecution, war and 
conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations 
grew significantly over the five years 2010–15. According 
to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) report, during 2013 an average of 32,200 
individuals per day were forced to leave their home and 
seek protection elsewhere, either within the borders of 
their own country or in other countries (UNHCR 2015a). 
This represents a significant increase to previous years 
(23,400 in 2012 and 14,200 in 2011). In the same year, 
there was a record 1.1 million individual applications 
for asylum or refugee status submitted to governments 
and UNHCR offices in 167 UN countries or territories. 
As put by António Guterres, head of the UN’s refugee 
agency ‘We are witnessing a quantum leap in forced 

Chapter 4  Demographic transformations    101
displacement in the world’ (The Guardian 2015). Overall, 
an estimated total of 51.2 million individuals were forced 
to flee their homes around the world by the end of 2013 
and this is the highest recorded level since the Second 
World War. If all these people had their own country it 
would be the 24th most populous in the world. UNHCR 
identifies seven population categories of forcefully dis-
placed people: refugees; asylum-seekers; internally 
displaced persons (IDPs); refugees who have returned 
home (returnees); IDPs who have returned home; per-
sons under UNHCR stateless mandate; and others who 
do not fall under any of these categories.
The largest source country of refugees is Afghani-
stan (and has been for over three decades) as a result 
of long-term conflicts and war. It is now closely followed 
by Syria, which became the second largest origin of 
refugees within just five years and has moved from being 
the second largest refugee-hosting country to being the 
second largest refugee source country. The civil war 
that broke out there in the spring of 2011 has resulted in 
the uprooting of half the country’s pre-war population. 
According to UNHCR more than 4 million Syrians are 
refugees in neighbouring countries and an additional 7.6 
million internally displaced (BBC 2015). Other countries 
that are in the top origins of refugees include Somalia, 
Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (UNHCR 
2015a). More details and statistical data (including data 
on historical trends by region and by country) are avail-
able via the UNHCR’s statistical website (www.unhcr.
org/statistics).
The overwhelming majority (86 per cent) of the 
global refugee population is hosted by developing 
countries (UNHCR 2015b). The country with the 
largest number of refugees is Pakistan (1.6 million), 
followed by Iran, Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. A rela-
tively small proportion (15 per cent) of refugees are 
located in Europe (UNHCR 2015b). However, there is 
a very large (and rapidly increasing) number of people 
risking (and losing) their lives in order to seek refuge 
there. According to ‘The Migrants Files’ (www.detec-
tive.io/detective/the-migrants-files/), a project set up 
by a pan-European consortium of journalists and the 
European Network Against Racism ‘United for Inter-
cultural Action’ (www.unitedagainstracism.org/), there 
have been at least 29,000 deaths of people (including 
hundreds of babies and children) attempting to reach 
Europe since 2000. A lot of these deaths occurred in 
the Mediterranean sea, as desperate people attempt to 
cross it in often rickety and unseaworthy boats, dying 
on an almost daily basis (Rice-Oxley and Mahmood 
2014). According to a recent report by the BBC (2015) 
drawing on data by the International Organization for 
Migration (www.iom.int/) more than 1,700 people are 
believed to have died in the first four months of 2015, 
compared with 96 up to the end of April in 2014.
At least 800 people drowned in a single incident on 
19 April 2015 after the boat they were travelling in cap-
sized in the Libyan waters south of the Italian island of 
Lampedusa on 19 April 2015. According to UNHCR, in 
the first five months of 2015 more than 42,000 people 
(most of them refugees) arrived by sea in Greece, six 
times the level of the same period in 2014 and almost 
the same as the total for all 2014. Over 90 per cent of 
these people originated from refugee-producing coun-
tries, principally Syria (over 60 per cent of arrivals in 
the first five months of 2015), Afghanistan, Iraq, Soma-
lia and Eritrea (UNHCR 2015b).
The increasing numbers of people trying to seek 
refuge in Europe and the recent deaths of thousands 
of migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean prompted 
the European Union to prepare an emergency 
response to stave off a worsening of the humanitarian 
crisis. This includes proposals for all member states 
to host a set number of migrants, partly to relieve the 
pressure on southern states like Italy and Greece. 
However, they also include controversial proposals (that 
were heavily criticized by human rights activists and 
organizations such as Amnesty International) for mili-
tary action to identify, capture and destroy boats that 
carry migrants before they embark to Europe (Traynor 
2015). So far, as we write in 2015, protestors have 
manged to prevent the military powers of rich nations 
from carrying out such inhuman acts. It should also be 
noted that there are also now strong anti-immigration 
sentiment and views in some regions and countries 
of Europe that oppose the welcoming and integration 
of immigrants and refugees. These are similar to the 
anti-refugee sentiments in the 1930s and early 1940s 
that resulted in Jewish people being barred entry into 
countries such as the UK. At the same time, there are 
emerging movements and activist networks calling 
for open welcoming spaces, such as the ‘all together’ 
initiative in the Greek island of Lesvos (http://lesvos.
w2eu.net/). Similarly, over 70 years ago activists man-
aged to help Jewish children escape mainland Europe 
on the kinder-transports – if not their parents. Given 
knowledge of refugees situations in our recent past it 
is surprising that such initiatives are not more warmly 
embraced and supported by the European Union and 
by local and national governments, given the potential 
benefits (see Section 4.5) and the expedient challenges 
of aging populations in Europe (also see Section 4.8).

102    Section 2  Population, resources, food, the environment and development
4.8 The challenges of ageing 
populations
According to UN calculations (Population Reference 
Bureau 2014) in 1970 just under half (48 per cent) of the 
global population was younger than 20. Another 47 per 
cent was aged 20–64 and the remaining 5 per cent was 
aged 65 and older. The age structure of the world’s popu-
lation has now significantly changed as a result of lower 
fertility rates and longer life expectancy. The population 
under age 20 is now approximately just 35 per cent and is 
falling most rapidly, whereas the population aged 20–64 
is 58 per cent, falling in numbers more slowly and the 
population aged 65 and over is 7 per cent and rising as a 
share of the total. However, there is considerable varia-
tion across world regions and countries.
Europe and North America have populations that are 
much older than the global average. It can be argued that 
this is the result of them entering the final stage of the 
transition model discussed in Section 4.2. Whereas, in 
contrast, Africa’s current youthful age structure is simi-
lar to the global average in 1970 (Population Reference 
Bureau 2014). These differences in population structures 
are illustrated in the diagrams shown in ­Figure 4.17. 
These diagrams, known as population pyramids, show 
the distribution of the men and women in the world and 
different world regions by age groups in 1970 and 2014. 
It is worth noting the difference in the shape between 
Europe and North America and the other continents 
(and especially Africa). The shape of these diagrams for 
Europe and North America (and especially by 2014) is 
often described as a ‘constrictive pyramid’ typical for 
affluent societies with low fertility and mortality rates 
and relatively older populations. As can be seen in the 
first pyramid shown in Figure 4.17, there is a trend for 
the world population pyramid to become ‘constrictive’. 
In addition, the 2014 pyramids for Europe and North 
America clearly stand out from the rest
Soon most countries in Europe and North America 
are going to be faced with a demographic and pension 
crisis as there will be fewer people of working age and 
fewer taxpayers, making it impossible to provide current 
levels of support, especially in areas of net out young 
migration and fertility below 1.5 children per potential 
couple. A possible solution to these issues could include 
increasing the retirement age (and this has already hap-
pened in some countries, including the UK), as this would 
result in additional working years and tax revenues and a 
reduction in the time that a person might receive a state 
pension. Another possible solution often discussed is for 
governments to try and stimulate birth rates so that more 
young people enter the economy in the future. A few gov-
ernments are therefore resorting to incentive schemes to 
try and arrest the declining birth rates experienced by 
many European countries. For example, the German gov-
ernment introduced in January 2007 a ‘parents’ money’ 
law, which means that parents who remain at home to 
look after their child will receive 67 per cent of their pre-
vious income for a year (up to €1800 per month). Those 
on a low income will receive 12 monthly payments of 
€450. This is extremely generous when compared to the 
British system wherein a new mother receives 90 per cent 
of her previous pay for 6 weeks and then a flat €150 for 
26 weeks only. Men can take 2 weeks paid paternity leave 
at €150 per week for 2 weeks. In Norway mothers receive 
10 months at full pay and men have to take 4 weeks pater-
nity leave at full pay, helping the country to the third high-
est birth rate in Europe. Poland and Italy have recently 
introduced an incentive of a one-off payment for each 
child born.
The more obvious solution of encouraging interna-
tional migration into countries with ageing populations 
is also a way of increasing their workforce and slowing 
down population growth in poorer countries. In addition, 
increased migration into countries like the UK would help 
reduce current debts, and also help in caring for a grow-
ing elderly population. It would also reduce global popu-
lation growth faster than even the current very fast rate of 
growth slowdown. That is because young migrants from 
poorer countries who move to countries like the UK tend 
to have fewer children than they would have had had they 
not migrated. Although many other factors will influence 
the future level of public sector debt in the UK, increased 
immigration reduces debt, while emigration of younger 
adults from Britain will increase it.
4.9 Conclusion
Throughout human history the global population expe-
rienced relatively slow growth, with the exceptions of the 
Neolithic Revolution and the most recent era of global 
population acceleration from 1851 to 1971, leading to 
a population explosion from 1 billion in 1820 to 7 bil-
lion in 2011. The most significant increase occurred in 
the past 60 years, when the population went up by 4 bil-
lion, from 3 billion in 1950 to 7 billion in 2011. How-
ever, it is vital to realize that for the majority of those 
past 60 years population growth rates have been rapidly 
decelerating everywhere. During this period the popula-
tion of the more affluent world (described by the UN as 
‘developed regions’) increased from 800 million in 1950

to only 1.2 billion in 2011 (and it is now only stabilized 
by in-migration), whereas the population of the poorest 
(‘least developed’) regions more than trebled, going up 
from 1.7 billion to 5.8 billion. That global division is due 
to deceleration in the growth rate having been earliest and 
fastest in the richest of places and, at the other end of a 
continuum, latest and slowest in just a few parts of Africa.
The overall planetary population increase has been 
placing a strain on environmental, food, housing and 
welfare infrastructures. However, it should be noted that 
it is not just the number of people that has an impact on 
these infrastructures, but how people live. For instance, 
the so-called ‘developed countries’ have been polluting 
the environment and contributing to global warming 
and climate change far more compared to the most popu-
lous poorer parts of the world (see Chapter 6). The strain 
is not from those who are greatest in number, but from 
those whose greed is most great, in both rich and poor 
countries alike. Greed control is now much more impor-
tant than population control.
This chapter has highlighted as especially impor-
tant the fact that since 1971 the world has entered an 
era of global deceleration of population growth rates. 
There is projected to be an even more significant slow-
down in population growth very soon, which is expected 
to lead to a world human population peak of, at most, 
ten ­billion being reached by around 2100. Average fertility 
rates worldwide are rapidly falling and are predicted to 
continue to fall and converge to just below the population 
replacement level rate of 2.1 by 2100 in all world regions. 
Estimates, of course, vary greatly although few people 
talk as seriously as they should about the future low-
fertility scenarios in which fewer than 9 billion ­people 
might be the peak. In contrast, in 2015 talk of 11 billion 
humans by 2100 was more common. The uncertainty is 
important to acknowledge. We humans think we know so 
much but we don’t even know how many grandchildren 
we are likely to have, even in aggregate.
As fertility’s contribution to population growth is 
declining, migration is playing a more and more impor-
tant role in the growth and social and economic devel-
opment of countries and regions, and there have been 
increasing numbers of international migrants crossing 
borders in recent years. At the same time, there has been 
a dramatic increase in average life expectancy across 
the world over the past 200 years. In 1800 all countries 
around the world had an average life expectancy at birth 
of less than 45 years (according to the Gapminder; see 
Useful websites section); by 2013 the estimated global 
average life expectancy was 71 years.
Averages only tell us so much. There are still signifi-
cant social and spatial inequalities in life expectancy and 
life chances worldwide. In the so-called ‘least developed 
countries’ the average life expectancy at birth was 61.5 
years in 2013, whereas in sub-Saharan African countries it 
was 56.9 years. In contrast, in the affluent world (in the so-
called ‘high income countries’ as classified by the World 
Bank) average life expectancy was 79.4 years and in par-
ticular parts of the regions of this richest section of the 
world it was even higher (e.g. 83.3 in Japan and 80.4 years 
when the European Union is averaged out). In contrast to 
such longevity, poorer countries are far more affected by 
disease, natural disasters (including disasters caused by 
climate change) and wars that have been disproportion-
ally affecting all the poorest regions of the world, leading 
to the slow-down in gain, or even a short decline in life 
expectancy, as well as to human displacement. Mostly 
recently, countries such as Afghanistan and Syria have 
reported significant numbers of premature deaths due to 
conflict and huge numbers of people having to become 
refugees. The overwhelming majority of the world’s refu-
gees are hosted by developing countries and only a rela-
tively small number are hosted by affluent countries. For 
example, only 15 per cent of global refugees are hosted in 
Europe and 7 per cent in the Americas.
Recently some groups within some of the more afflu-
ent countries have been facing decreases in life expectancy 
due to rising income and wealth inequalities as well as the 
introduction of severe and sometimes punitive austerity 
measures (O’Hara 2014; The Guardian 2015). Further, 
there have been a growing number of studies suggesting 
a very strong link between a number of factors relating 
to life expectancy, well-being and health of populations 
and income and wealth inequality, especially in more 
affluent societies. In particular, according to the ground-
breaking book The Spirit Level: Why Equality is Better 
for Everyone, by epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and 
Kate Pickett (2010), a wide number of indicators (includ-
ing demographic indicators such as life expectancy) are 
related to inequalities in income and wealth.
Regions of the affluent world (in short especially 
Europe, North America and Japan) are facing the chal-
lenges of ageing populations and a potential demographic 
and pension crisis on top of all the trends already listed 
here. As we argued in this chapter, an obvious way to 
respond to this potential crisis is to encourage international 
migration, including a warmer welcome and integration 
of refugees. Net international migration tends to be into 
countries with ageing populations and is also a way of 
increasing their workforce and slowing down population 
growth in poorer countries. Migrants tend to have fewer 
children than people in the areas they leave, and to behave 
more like the population they join in terms of their fertility.
Overall, it is very important to understand demo-
graphic trends and processes as well as the interdepend-
encies between countries, regions and cities and all their 

Chapter 4  Demographic transformations    105
populations, but to also highlight the fact that the actual 
number of people on the planet is, to an important 
extent, incidental to the impact humans have on both 
the environment and each other. This is also illustrated 
in all other chapters of this book. It is not how many of 
us there are or will be that matters most, but how we all 
behave, think and act in future. Control greed and we can 
expect a healthy demographic future.
Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter, you should be able to:
● Recognize the dynamic nature of populations,  
not only in terms of size but also with respect to  
the geographies which exist within the overall growth.
● Explore how sudden economic changes, disasters 
or disease affects life expectancy and alters the 
course taken by countries through the demographic 
transition process.
● Acknowledge the increasing importance of migra-
tion as a component of national population change 
alongside fertility and mortality.
● Assess the significant problems that ageing popu-
lations will have in terms of social and economic 
development, as well as issues of selfishness, 
empathy and greed.
● Understand the potential impact of inequality upon 
demographic issues and life expectancy.

108    Section 2  Population, resources, food, the environment and development
T
he large-scale exploitation of the planet’s resource 
base is one of the defining characteristics of the age in 
which we live (McNeill 2000); fortunately, we are increas-
ingly aware of the finite nature of the planet’s resource 
base (see Chapter 6). The explosion at the Deepwater 
Horizon drilling platform in April 2010, and the subse-
quent oil leak that poured oil into the Gulf of Mexico for 
three months, provides a stark reminder that the exploita-
tion of natural resources usually results in environmental 
degradation. There are also many tragic reminders of the 
human cost of resource extraction, such as the continuing 
high death toll of coal miners in China. Indeed, all energy 
sources carry risks, as the crisis in March 2011 at the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in Japan follow-
ing the devastating earthquake and tsunami showed. This 
chapter explores the nature of natural resources and con-
siders the relationship between resource production and 
consumption, economic development and climate change 
(see Gautier 2008 for a discussion of climate change and 
the role of energy). The chapter is divided into three sec-
tions, each with a distinct task. The first section examines 
the nature of ‘natural resource’, it evaluates the various 
ways of classifying resources and analyses the diverse fac-
tors that influence their availability. The second section 
analyses the specific case of energy resources, and reviews 
the various types of renewable energy and the changing 
geographies of oil and gas production and consumption. 
The third section considers the interrelationship between 
energy consumption, economic development and climate 
change. The chapter concludes by discussing the energy 
dilemmas that currently face the different regions of the 
world and the emerging global energy paradox in relation 
to continued investment in fossil fuels.
5.1 Natural resources
The Earth holds a finite stock of resources, the resource 
base. However, what human societies consider a resource 
has varied through time and across space. As both Zim-
merman and Rees acknowledge above, something is a 
resource because human society attaches value to it. Many 
of the things we value today as ‘resources’ held no value 
in the past and may hold no value in the future. Followers 
of science fiction, such as Star Trek, see a future based on 
resources and technologies that have yet to be created.
5.1.1 Defining resources
In his seminal work World Resources and Industries, 
Zimmerman (Peach and Constantin 1972: 9) states: 
‘The word “resource” does not refer to a substance, but 
a function that a thing or a substance may perform, or 
to an operation in which it might take place.’ He also 
notes that ‘resources are . . . as dynamic as civilization 
itself’. In fact, one can suggest that each major human 
civilization was sustained by a particular set of resources 
and technologies for their exploitation (Smil 1994; Sim-
mons 1996); the archaeological record includes the Stone 
Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. In reference to the 
Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century, Simmons 
(1996: 208) states that ‘industrialization based on fossil 
fuel energy represents a turning point in the history of 
human–nature relations’. If the nineteenth century was 
based on the era of coal, then the twentieth century will 
been seen as the era of oil. Clearly, the changing notion 
of what constitutes a ‘resource’ is an important factor in 
shaping the relationship between human societies and the 
natural environment. As Blunden (1995: 164) observed, 
‘Because definition as a resource depends on usefulness 
to human society, natural materials may be required as 
resources by societies in some times and places but not in 
others.’ While it is still the case that people in many parts 
of the world live in what Mather and Chapman (1995: 
139) call ‘low-energy societies’ (dependent upon plants, 
animals and human labour), one of the defining charac-
teristics of our age, and a consequence of the processes of 
globalization, is that the majority of societies now have 
some shared notion of what sorts of things constitute 
resources. The Inuit living in northern Canada are as 
dependent on gasoline for their skidoos as the commut-
ers for their cars in Los Angeles or London are. Further-
more, echoing Lenin’s famous edict that ‘Communism is 
electrification plus Soviet labour power’, the provision of 
electricity is central to the modernization process in all 
types of societies. There are still 1.4 billion people around 
the world that lack access to electricity (IEA, UNDP and 
UNIDO 2010). There is increasing acknowledgement of 
the centrality of energy access to poverty alleviation and 
2014 marked the beginning of the UN’s decade of ‘Sus-
tainable Energy for All’.
If the notion of resource is dynamic and intimately 
linked to the evolution of human society, it follows 
that so-called ‘technological progress’ both creates and 
destroys resource value. As new technologies emerge, 
dependent on particular resources, so old technolo-
gies and their associated resources become redundant. 
For example, today flint has limited value as a building 
material, yet in the Stone Age it was an essential resource 
for making tools. Because such resources had ‘use value’ 
they were also objects of trade. Other resources that 
were valued in the Bronze Age, such as copper and zinc, 
are still valued today as new ways of using them are 
discovered. New technologies also create new demands 
and concerns, such as the availability of so-called rare

and gas companies – Shell, Exxon Mobil, BP, Sinopec 
(China Petroleum and Petrochemical Company) and 
CNPC (China National Petroleum Company) (Dicken 
2015: 395–422). Our discussion so far has implied that 
all resources share the same characteristics. However, 
we know that there are many different types of natural 
resource and the various ways of classifying them is the 
subject of the next section.
5.1.2 Classifying resources
Natural resources are commonly divided into two types: 
non-renewable or stock resources and renewable or 
flow resources (Figure 5.1). Stock resources are those, 
mainly mineral, that have taken millions of years to form 
and so their availability is finite. Hence, we also refer to 
them as non-renewable as there is no possibility of their 
being replenished on a timescale of relevance to human 
society. Within the category of stock resources, it is useful 
to distinguish between those that are consumed by use, 
such as fuel minerals, those that are theoretically recover-
able and those that are recyclable, such as aluminium. A 
further characteristic of stock resources is that they tend 
to be highly localized, that is they are found in relative 
abundance only in specific places, such as ore deposits 
and coalfields. Some stock resources are more abundant 
than others and their relative scarcity affects their value. 
For example, aggregate minerals, like sand and gravel, are 
relatively abundant, while precious metals, such as gold 
and silver, are relatively rare.
earth metals used in many ‘green’ technologies or lith-
ium that is needed for rechargeable batteries. The use 
value of resources also means that control over their 
supply is an important part of political and economic 
power. In theory at least, resource-rich regions are able 
to exploit this natural advantage in their dealings with 
resource-poor regions. Consequently, gaining control 
over particular resources has been at the heart of many 
wars and much conflict (Klare 2002; Le Billon 2007). 
The European colonization of the ‘developing world’ 
was motivated by a desire to discover and control new 
sources of resources. It is also no surprise that even 
today five of the world’s ten largest corporations are oil

achieved in 2010, five years ahead of schedule. In 2012, 
89 per cent of the world’s population had access to an 
improved source, up from 76 per cent in 1990. Over 2.3 
billion people gained access to an improved source of 
drinking water between 1990 and 2012.
However, a large rural–urban divide still exists with 
access still an issue in rural areas. By comparison, far less 
progress has been made on the sanitation goal, and here 
the situation is much worse in urban than rural areas. The 
resource continuum recognizes that access to (clean) air 
and water supply now have scarcity value and should be 
considered as finite.
In our discussion so far we have highlighted the com-
plexity of the notion of natural resource and considered 
the various ways of classifying resources, but what factors 
affect the availability of particular resources?
5.1.3 Resource availability
As was noted earlier, at any moment in time there is 
a finite stock of natural resources on the planet, the 
resource base. Each stock resource has its own resource 
base, the total quantity of a substance or property on 
the planet, for example, the total amount of oil geo-
logically present today. However, that total resource 
base is not the amount available for human exploita-
tion. ­Figure 5.3 illustrates the relationship between the 
resource base and the various sub-divisions of resource 
availability. The term proven reserve is applied to those 
deposits that have already been discovered and are 
known to be economically extractable under current 
demand, price and technological conditions. However, 
the extent of a proven reserve is dynamic and dependent 
upon a host of interlinked factors. These include the 
availability of the technology and skills to exploit the 
resource, the level of demand, the cost of production 
Renewable or flow resources are those that are 
naturally renewed within a sufficiently short time-span 
to be of use to human society. Again we can distinguish 
between different types of stock resource. Figure 5.1 
divides flow resources into ‘critical zone’ and ‘non-­critical 
zone’ resources. The distinction here is between those 
flow resources whose continued availability is dependent 
upon management by society (critical zone) and those 
that will continue to be available independent of the 
actions of society (non-critical zone). As indicated by 
the arrows, it is possible for critical zone flow resources 
to become stock resources if they are mismanaged and 
their regenerative capacity is exceeded. Thus, resource 
management aims to ensure that exploitation of a par-
ticular renewable resource does not damage its capacity 
to replace itself. In recognition of the increasing chal-
lenge, and the numerous failures, to manage renewable 
resources, Rees (1991: 8) has developed an alternative to 
the conventional two-part typology of natural resources: 
‘All resources are renewable on some timescale . . . what 
matters for the sustainability of future supplies is the 
relative rates of replenishment and use . . . it seems bet-
ter . . . to think in terms of a “resource continuum” than 
the conventional two-part typology’ (Figure 5.2). Water 
might once have been considered a relatively abundant 
resource, but the combined impact of population growth 
and industrialization is placing increasing stress on the 
planet’s finite supply of fresh water. Millennium Devel-
opment Goal 7 (see www.developmentgoals.org) is to 
ensure environmental sustainability, and a target was set 
to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without sus-
tainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanita-
tion. In their 2014 assessment (United Nations 2014c), 
the UN noted that:
The target of halving the proportion of people with-
out access to an improved drinking water source was

and processing, the price it can command in the mar-
ketplace, the availability and price of substitutes, and 
the environmental and social costs of developing the 
resource. The extent to which each of these factors 
influences resource development also varies across 
space and time. Today we have the technological abil-
ity to recover resources in geological and environmental 
conditions that were previously uneconomic. For exam-
ple, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of 
Mexico that was destroyed by an explosion in April 
2010 was designed to operate in waters up to 2,400 
metres (8,000 feet), to a maximum drill depth of 9,100 
metres (30,000 feet). It was pushing the limits of off-
shore production into ever-deeper waters and deeper 
fields. The recent growth of shale gas production in 
North America relies on new techniques of horizontal 
drilling and fracturing that release the oil and natu-
ral gas trapped in shale deposits far below ground at a 
competitive cost, resulting in a dramatic surge in natu-
ral gas production in the USA, but also a reassessment 
of the scale of global natural gas reserves.
The category of conditional reserve refers to depos-
its that have already been discovered but are not eco-
nomic to work at prevailing price levels using currently 
available extraction and production technologies. The 
boundary between proven and conditional reserves 
is dynamic and bi-directional (that is, resources that 
change from conditional to proven reserves can, if con-
ditions change, revert to conditional status). Canada’s 
oil sands are at this boundary. High production costs 
require an oil price of US$65 or higher to be economic, 
when the price falls below this level investment in oil 
sands production falls substantially. This has happened 
more than once before and the most recent fall in the oil 
price has again resulted in a reduction in investment in 
oil sands projects. One of the reasons that OPEC (Saudi 
Arabia in particular) is allowing the oil price to fall is 
that they want to test how sensitive unconventional oil 
and gas production in North America is to a low-oil-
price environment.
The two remaining categories of resource are not 
readily available to society. Hypothetical resources

factors that can promote resource scarcity (Table 5.1). 
The resource crisis of the 1970s was motivated by geo-
politics, but by increasing the price of energy, it brought 
about other forms of scarcity. For example, the increased 
price of oil had a major negative impact upon those coun-
tries in the ‘developing world’ that had embarked upon 
industrialization and had become increasingly dependent 
upon imported oil. However, it also shocked the ‘devel-
oped world’ into the realization that energy resources 
were finite, energy conservation was worthwhile and that 
alternative sources of energy were required. The ‘devel-
oped world’, and particularly the United States, then 
recognized the strategic importance of securing ‘energy 
independence’, which is now seen by many as achievable 
thanks to unconventional oil and gas.
In July 2008 the oil price peaked at US$144 a barrel, 
only to fall below US$40 by November 2009 as a global 
economic crisis took hold. Despite continued geopoliti-
cal tensions in the Middle East and North Africa, we still 
have a relative abundance of oil, in large part because 
the global economic recession reduced demand. The 
oil price soon rebounded and found a new equilibrium 
around the US$100 mark; however, in the summer of 
2014 the price started another dramatic decline, falling 
to less than US$50 a barrel. At the time this book went 
to press the price had fallen below $30 a barrel. This time 
the cause is over-supply relative to global demand. But 
there is no scope for complacency; the rapid growth of 
energy demand in the emerging economies, especially 
China and India, is causing concern that high energy 
prices will eventually return. This coincides with increas-
ing societal concerns about the ecological consequences 
of increased energy consumption (for the most recent 
analysis of the causes of anthropogenic change see IPCC 
2014). The prospect of increasing demand as a result of 
are those that we may expect to find in the future in 
areas that have only been partially surveyed and devel-
oped. Thus, the US Geological Survey has suggested 
that the Arctic accounts for 13 per cent of the world’s 
undiscovered oil and 30 per cent of its undiscovered gas. 
There are also hypothetical resources in regions such as 
Antarctica, but the international community has placed 
a moratorium on resource development, for the time 
being at least. Speculative resources are those that 
might be found in unexplored areas that are thought 
to have favourable geological conditions. Finally, there 
remains a large part of the earth about which we have 
no information on its potential resource base. The 
strength of this classification is that it stresses the highly 
dynamic nature of the concept of resource reserve. Its 
weakness is that it lends itself to the idea that we will 
never run out of resources; there will always be more to 
discover and new technology will continue to make new 
resources available for exploitation. Even if that was the 
case, and clearly it is not, the planet now faces the addi-
tional problem that the consumption of resources, such 
as hydrocarbon fuels, produces wastes that threaten the 
stability of the global ecosystem. Thus, there is a need 
to rethink the whole notion of resource scarcity to take 
into account the ecological cost of our current ‘fossil 
fuels society’.
Given the highly dynamic nature of resources, at any 
moment in time, it is very difficult to estimate the level of 
resource availability. It is even more difficult to speculate 
about future levels of production and consumption and, 
thus, the possibility of resource scarcity. Nonetheless, 
the supporters of ‘peak oil’ maintain that the world will 
soon reach the point of maximum oil production (Def-
feyes 2001), which is highly contested, not just because 
extrapolation on the basis of current trends is often mis-
leading, but also because there are a whole variety of

economic development in the ‘global south’, combined 
with the challenges of climate change, has led to the idea 
of a ‘New Energy Paradigm’ that combines traditional 
concerns about security of energy supply at reasonable 
prices with the need to devise energy policies that reduce 
carbon emissions (Helm 2007).
5.2 Fuelling the planet
Of all the different types of resource that we have dis-
cussed so far, in recent history it is those that provide 
energy services (we transform energy resources to obtain 
services such as heating, light, transportation, etc.) that 
have been the most sought after. For most of human his-
tory societies have utilized renewable sources of energy; 
flow resources such as wood that can be depleted, sus-
tained or increased by human activity; and continuous 
resources, such as water to drive watermills or the wind 
to turn windmills, that are available irrespective of human 
activity (Figure 5.4). They have also used draught animals, 
horses, buffalo, etc., but these need to be fed and housed. 
The Industrial Revolution changed the way in which cer-
tain parts of the world powered their economies, leaving 
the remainder dependent upon renewable resources.
5.2.1 The dominance of fossil fuels
Since the invention of the steam engine about 200 years 
ago, much of human society has become ever more 
dependent upon the exploitation of non-renewable 
energy resources (see Smil 2010 for an introduction to 
the energy system and energy transitions). According 
to BP (2015), in 2014 fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) still 
accounted for 86.3 per cent of the primary commercial 
energy consumed on the planet. These resources were 
formed from the decomposition of organic materials mil-
lions of years ago and have been transformed by heat and 
pressure into coal, oil and natural gas. The advantage of 
fossil fuels as a source of energy is that they are readily 
accessible, a highly concentrated source of energy, easy 
to convert using proven technologies, and cost-efficient 
in production and use. Unfortunately, the combustion of 
fossil fuels is also the single largest source of greenhouse 
gases (GHG).

in the Asia-Pacific region, while the European Union sees 
LNG supplies as a means of compensating for declines in 
domestic production and diversifying its sources of sup-
ply away from Russia.
5.2.2 Alternative sources of energy
Given the finite nature of hydrocarbon fuels, the prob-
lems of scarcity and the environmental consequences 
of burning fossil fuels, it is no surprise that alterna-
tive sources of energy have been sought. There are two 
alternatives (see Figure 5.4): first, developing new ways 
of harnessing renewable energy sources, and second, 
developing nuclear power. At present all commercial 
nuclear power stations use so-called fission reactors 
that release energy, mainly in the form of heat, which 
Oil is the most versatile fossil fuel while coal, even 
though it is relatively bulky, is still used in many indus-
trial processes, as a source of heat, and is the most 
important fuel for electricity generation. The great 
advantage of oil is its transportability over long dis-
tances in large volumes using pipelines, ocean tankers, 
or smaller rail and road tankers. It has spawned a huge 
petrochemical industry producing a vast range of prod-
ucts, including plastics and textiles, that have substi-
tuted products based on renewable resources, such as 
wood and cotton, for those based on non-renewable 
resources. In addition, oil has created many resources, 
such as jet engine fuel, for which commercially viable 
substitutes have yet to be developed. Consequently, 
advanced industrial societies are totally dependent 
upon the continued supply of oil at a reasonable price, 
which explains the importance that governments attach 
to energy security (for a comprehensive discussion of 
oil see Bridge and Le Billon 2012).
In recent years, natural gas has become an increasingly 
important source of energy and a feedstock for petro-
chemicals. In many advanced industrialized economies it 
has replaced coal as the favoured resource for electricity 
generation and domestic heating. However, the transport 
flexibility of natural gas is inferior to oil; pipeline trans-
port is most economic but the infrastructure investment 
needed requires sizeable reserves, a secure source of pro-
duction (security of supply) and stable markets (security 
of demand). Liquefied natural gas (LNG), produced via 
cooling and high pressure, is an option but the process 
requires substantial investment in plant and consumes 
large quantities of energy. Nevertheless, LNG production 
is becoming an increasingly important fuel, particularly

The other alternative to fossil fuels is the development 
of ‘new’ or ‘modern’ renewable sources of energy (Evans 
2007: 81–114). Many of these renewable sources involve 
applying new technologies to historic sources of energy 
supply and scaling them up to provide an alternative source 
of electricity generation and fuel. While no single source 
is likely to provide an alternative to fossil fuels, collectively 
they can start to reduce our reliance on hydrocarbons. A 
review by the Swedish Academy of Sciences (Destouni and 
Frank 2010: 19) maintains that, by 2050, renewable energy 
can be expected to provide up to 35 per cent of global 
energy supply and nearly half of electricity production, 
which still means that 65 per cent of global energy will 
come from fossil fuels and nuclear power.
is then used to generate electricity. In the 1950s, nuclear 
energy was heralded as a cheap and clean alternative to 
fossil fuels, but safety issues discouraged the expected 
expansion of the nuclear industry (see Case study 5.1). 
In recent years, since it does not generate CO2, the 
nuclear option for electricity production has been back 
on the agenda even though many of the concerns about 
high costs, safety, the disposal of radioactive waste 
and the decommissioning of power stations remain.  
The disaster at Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 
Japan has reopened the debate and there is renewed 
uncertainty about the role that nuclear power can play 
in meeting the growing demand for energy and mitigat-
ing climate change.
Case study 5.1
Nuclear power remains in the mix
During the 1950s the peaceful use of nuclear power 
was heralded as the great hope for the world’s energy 
needs. Harnessing the power of the atom promised 
a cheap and clean source of electricity. The energy 
crisis of the 1970s increased interest in a nuclear 
solution. By developing a nuclear power industry, the 
developed world hoped that it could reduce its reliance 
upon OPEC-supplied oil. The 1970s and 1980s saw 
a rapid expansion in the generating capacity of the 
world’s nuclear power plants. Between 1960 and 1990 
total global electrical generating capacity had grown 
from zero to 328 gigawatts. In the last decade or so 
growth has stalled (in 2008 the total global capacity was 
372.5 gigwatts) with the real possibility of a decline in 
total capacity. What went wrong and have conditions 
changed such that a return to nuclear power is now 
back on the agenda?
In short, as the nuclear power industry developed, 
expanded and matured it became increasingly appar-
ent that the supposed benefits were far outweighed 
by the environmental problems it posed. Reddish and 
Rand (1996: 79) listed four criticisms levelled at nuclear 
power by environmental groups and these remain the 
major concerns today:
1.	 Abnormal radiation levels from normal operations 
will cause cell damage, malignant cancers, genetic 
diseases, etc.
2.	 Reactor operations and transport of irradiated fuels 
cannot be guaranteed safe against catastrophic 
accidents.
3.	 Radioactive waste has to be disposed of safely and 
reactors have to be decommissioned, all of which is 
extremely costly.
4.	 The radioactive materials needed to fuel the reac-
tors need to be kept safe and secure from theft or 
misappropriation to make nuclear weapons (the so-
called proliferation problem).
Over the years public trust in nuclear power has been 
significantly eroded by a number of serious accidents, 
such as those at Windscale, Cumbria (United Kingdom) 
in 1957, Three Mile Island (USA) in 1979, Chernobyl 
in the Ukraine in 1986 and most recently Fukushima in 
2011. Furthermore, as the true cost of building, main-
taining and decommissioning nuclear power plants has 
become apparent, many have questioned the economics 
of nuclear power relative to other sources of energy.
Despite these problems, in 2008 nuclear power 
accounted for 15 per cent of global electricity gen-
eration, but until recently it has been very much an 
option for the developed world, partly because of 
cost and technology, but also because of concerns 
over the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In 1996, 
OECD member states accounted for 86.6 per cent 
of total nuclear power production, but by 2005 that 
share had fallen slightly to 83.8 per cent (IEA 2006: 
437). In 2008 the top three countries in terms of 
nuclear capacity were the United States (27.1 per 
cent), France (17.0 per cent) and Japan (12.4 per 
cent). In the same year, nuclear power accounted for 
76 per cent of total domestic electricity generation 
in France and 42 per cent in Sweden. Sweden had 
decided to phase out its nuclear power stations and

crops for biofuel production is either a natural habi-
tat supporting biodiversity or agricultural land that 
could be used for food production. At the same time, 
increased demand for crops such as corn is increas-
ing the cost of animal fodder and basic foodstuffs. 
Further, much of this production requires the use of 
fertilizers and pesticides that are hydrocarbon-based 
and consume considerable amounts of energy when 
they are produced. The net result is that many ‘first 
generation’ biofuels may actually consume more 
energy to produce than they generate when used  
to run a vehicle. So-called ‘second generation’ 
­biofuels aim to use non-food feedstock, organic 
waste and algae and may become a viable alterna-
tive to fossil fuels. Finally, on a small scale, gas from 
landfill sites and from the anaerobic digestion of 
vegetable waste is also being developed to produce 
bio-methane.
● Biomass energy was the very first form of energy 
used by humans and involves the burning of plant 
and animal residue to produce heat. In much of the 
world it is still the traditional source of energy. The 
IEA, UNDP and UNIDO (2010: 20) maintains that 
there are currently 2.7 billion people in developing 
countries who rely for cooking primarily on biomass 
used in inefficient devices. In industrially developed 
economies, wood waste from pulp and paper mills 
is used to generate heat and electricity, and in some 
households wood-burning fires are used for space 
heating, although often more as a lifestyle choice 
than out of necessity. More recently, the use of bio-
mass to produce alternative fuels, so-called biofu-
els, has gained popularity in the developed world; 
but it is increasingly apparent that if not properly 
managed biofuels production creates as many prob-
lems as it solves. The land being taken up to produce 
switch to conventional thermal power stations, but 
in 2009 it reversed this policy. Germany, by contrast, 
has decided to phase out nuclear power by the early 
2020s. However, concerns about climate change 
and the associated desire to reduce CO2 emissions, 
plus worries about fossil fuel energy security, means 
that many countries remain committed to nuclear 
power. Hedberg et al. (2010: 3) report that at present 
55 new reactors are being built in 30 countries, 137 
are planned and a further 295 are proposed for the 
future; there are currently nearly 440 fission reactors 
in operation in 30 countries (for further details visit 
www.world-nuclear.org).
For the emerging markets of China, India and 
Russia the expansion of nuclear power is seen as a 
key element of policies to meet the energy demand 
associated with rapid economic growth. Russia, for 
example, has a programme to increase the share of 
nuclear power in electricity generation from 15 per cent 
now to 25 per cent by 2020 and it is also exporting 
nuclear power stations to emerging markets. China has 
set a target to build 40 gigawatts of nuclear generating 
capacity by 2020 and India has a target of 40 gigawatts 
by 2030. Many OECD countries are also reconsider-
ing the nuclear option because, first, it addresses the 
need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and second, 
increased reliance on imported oil and gas is raising 
concerns about energy security. In particular, follow-
ing supply disruptions in 2006 and 2009 and now the 
conflict in Ukraine and the imposition of sanctions fol-
lowing the annexation of Crimea, the European Union 
wishes to reduce its reliance on supplies of natural gas 
from Russia. Given the high costs and long lead times 
to build nuclear power plants, a decision needs to be 
made now to avoid energy shortages in the future. The 
environmental movement remains vehemently against 
nuclear power as it argues that none of the long-
standing problems have been adequately addressed. 
Thus, the nuclear debate is being revisited in the 
United ­Kingdom and elsewhere in the OECD, as the 
­disadvantages of the nuclear option are set against the 
possible benefits it might bring in terms of addressing  
climate change and promoting energy security (see 
Case study 5.2). The UK government is now committed 
to building a new generation of ten nuclear power sta-
tions, all on the site of existing soon-to-be-decommis-
sioned nuclear stations, but progress is very slow and a 
new fleet of power stations now seems unlikely until the 
mid-2020s at the earliest. The United States’ Energy 
Information Administration (EIA 2010: 4) predicts that 
electricity generation from nuclear power will increase 
from 2.6 trillion kilowatt-hours in 2007, to 3.6 trillion 
kilowatt-hours in 2020 and 4.5 trillion kilowatt-hours by 
2035. The strongest growth will be in non-OECD Asia, 
where nuclear power electricity generation is projected 
to grow at an annual rate of 7.7 per cent a year from 
2007 to 2035. However, the disaster at Fukushima has 
increased public concern about the safety of nuclear 
power and the lessons learnt may increase the costs 
of nuclear power further, calling into doubt its viability. 
If nuclear power has fallen from favour again it may 
result in even higher levels of fossil fuel consumption 
as power companies turn to coal and gas as a low-cost 
alternative. Alternatively, it could spur investment in 
renewable energy, but that will also require advances in 
storage technologies.

capacity in 2014, China is first with 31 per cent, followed 
by the United States with 17.8 per cent and Germany with 
10.6 per cent (REN21 2015: 135). China is developing 
renewable energy at an astonishing pace, as it badly needs 
new sources of energy that will not aggravate already 
substantial energy-related environmental problems. It 
also sees the supply of equipment, such as wind turbines 
and solar PV, as a new growth area for industry for both 
domestic consumption and export.
● Hydropower generation also pre-dates the industrial 
revolution, but dams and hydroelectric schemes have 
now replaced the watermills that powered the early 
machines. In many regions of the world hydroelectric-
ity has become an important source of energy, but, in 
all but a few cases, Norway being one, it cannot offer 
a large-scale solution to a country’s energy needs. The 
building of dams to store water and build a ‘head’ to 
drive the turbines that generate the electricity floods 
large areas of land; it also starves river systems of flow 
and damages deltaic and riverine environments. The 
construction of Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze 
River in China involved the displacement of 1.2 million 
people and the creation of a reservoir occupying 111,000 
hectares. Other forms of waterpower, such as wave and 
tidal power, are also being developed. At present, there 
is only one large-scale commercial tidal power station in 
the world, the La Rance Tidal Power Plant in Brittany, 
France. In the UK a proposal to create a tidal lagoon in 
Cardiff bay to generate power is being backed by the 
Government. New forms of wave power and tidal power 
are being developed, such as the Pelamis Wave Energy 
Converter, but these are still at the developmental stage.
● The final form of renewable energy is geothermal 
energy. As the name suggests, this form of energy 
uses naturally occurring heat in the earth’s crust 
and is only really viable in areas of volcanic activity. 
There are two forms of geothermal energy. One is wet-
rock geothermal energy where steam or hot water is 
trapped from boreholes or surface vents and used to 
heat buildings or generate electricity. The other is hot–
dry geothermal energy, which is accessed by boreholes 
drilled into hot dry rocks. Water is then forced down 
and the steam used to generate electricity. At present 
geothermal energy accounts for about 10 per cent of 
New Zealand’s electricity production. In global terms, 
it is the United States that produces the most electric-
ity with geothermal power. In 2009, US geothermal 
power plants produced 15.2 billion kilowatt-hours, or  
0.4 per cent of total US electricity generation, and 
seven states have geothermal power plants. At a very 
local scale there is growing interest in using ground-
source heat pumps to heat individual buildings. This 
technology does not require a geothermal source, but 
makes use of renewable energy stored in the ground.
● Solar energy is ultimately the source of all energy, with 
the exception of nuclear power. Solar energy usually 
involves capturing the sun’s rays in order to produce 
thermal energy to warm buildings, heat hot water or 
generate steam to produce electricity. Alternatively, pho-
tovoltaic cells turn the sun’s rays directly into electricity 
(solar PV). As the efficiency of solar panels increases 
and their cost declines, so solar energy is becoming a 
viable small-scale local solution at the household or 
building level. However, it is subject to daily or sea-
sonal variations and is weather-dependent, but it can 
provide an efficient supplemental source of energy for 
heating domestic hot water, and so on (visit the website 
of the International Solar Energy Society at www.ises.
org). There are now some very ambitious large-scale 
projects aimed at harnessing the sun’s energy and trans-
mitting it via high-voltage transmission lines to centres 
of demand. The so-called ‘Desertec Concept’ is based 
on the proposition that ‘Within 6 hours the deserts 
receive more energy from the sun than humankind con-
sumes in a year’ (www.desertec.org) and it proposes the 
development of a network of concentrating solar power 
installations in North Africa to generate electricity for 
export to Europe. However, the current political insta-
bility in North Africa precludes immediate progress 
with this project. As the technology improves, energy 
costs increase and the costs of solar energy decrease, it 
will increasingly become part of the low-carbon energy 
solution.
● Wind power is of historical significance and has now 
made a return in the form of ‘wind farms’. Improved 
design has increased the efficiency of modern windmills 
and they are becoming an increasingly common sight in 
exposed coastal and upland locations in the developed 
world. Wind farms can generate electricity for local use 
or for the power grid. However, some would argue that 
modern wind farms lack the aesthetic qualities of tradi-
tional windmills and therefore many see them as a source 
of both visual and noise pollution. In Europe, Germany, 
Spain and the UK currently lead the way in wind power 
(EWEA 2014). In September 2010, Vattenfall opened the 
Thanet Offshore Wind Farm, which has 100 wind tur-
bines and covers an area of 35 square kilometres. At that 
time it was the largest operational offshore wind farm 
anywhere in the world and has a capacity of 300 mega-
watts, which has boosted UK offshore wind capacity by 
30 per cent, producing on average enough electricity to 
supply more than 200,000 homes. The UK has plans for 
further offshore wind farms to be built off the coast in 
the Thames Estuary, the Greater Wash and the North-
west, and the energy from them is expected to power  
15 per cent of UK households; however, onshore wind is 
meeting increased opposition and government subsidies 
are being withdrawn early. In terms of total installed wind

remain, as shown in Table 5.2. Simply because it accounts 
for most of the world’s energy consumption, the evolu-
tion of the energy mix tends to be linked to the develop-
ment of the industrialized world where coal was by far 
the most important energy resource at the start of the 
twentieth century. The oil industry was still in its early 
stages; the first modern oil well was drilled in the US state 
of Pennsylvania in 1859. Natural gas was not recognized 
as a resource at all. Hence, the dominance of coal was not 
threatened. Advances in transportation technology, such 
as the invention of the jet engine, and the emergence of a 
petrochemicals industry triggered a rapid increase in the 
demand for oil in the boom years after the Second World 
War. In 1950 coal accounted for 61 per cent of the world’s 
commercial energy consumption with only 27 per cent 
coming from oil, by 1970 it was 30 per cent from coal,  
44 per cent from oil and 20 per cent from natural gas. 
Even so, the absolute level of global coal production con-
tinues to increase at the same time as economic growth 
in the developed world is increasingly underpinned by 
oil and, more recently, by natural gas. The recent ‘dash-
for-gas’ in the developed world was driven by a desire 
to reduce dependence on oil imported from the Middle 
East and the fact that electricity generation using natu-
ral gas generates less greenhouse gases. Thus, in the past 
hundred years, the energy mix in the industrialized world 
has undergone two major transitions, from coal to oil and 
from oil to gas. In 2014, in the OECD, oil accounted for 
37 per cent of primary energy consumption, natural gas 
26.1 per cent and coal 19.1 per cent (BP 2015: 41).
The energy mix in the developing world is somewhat 
different (see Table 5.2). For the most part it remains 
more reliant upon oil for its commercial energy and in 
some regions coal remains the dominant resource. For 
example, China in 2014 accounted for 50.6 per cent of 
global coal consumption that produced 66 per cent of 
its primary energy consumption (BP 2015). Over the 
past few years China has met its growing energy needs 
by burning even more coal, raising obvious concerns 
about climate change. Elsewhere, dependence upon oil 
has made countries in the developing world particu-
larly vulnerable to sudden periodic increases in oil price 
over the past three decades, but they lack the capital 
and technology to develop their own energy potential 
or to diversify their energy mix. However, as it depletes 
its own sources of oil and gas the developed world has 
become increasingly dependent upon supplies from the 
developing world. Historically, the international oil com-
panies (IOCs) were the key actors delivering the energy 
resources of the developing world, but increasingly the 
governments of the oil-producing states have seized con-
trol over their oil and gas industries. Now IOCs, such 
as BP, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total and Shell, work in 
In nearly all of the above cases, renewable energy is 
already providing localized, small-scale solutions to energy 
needs but, at present, does not provide a viable alternative 
to fossil fuels. That said, the share of renewable energy in 
the global energy system is growing rapidly, albeit from a 
low base and there are places where it is making significant 
inroads – for example in Germany, where its growth fol-
lows a decision to move away from nuclear power. In 2013 
renewable energy, including large-scale hydroelectricity, 
accounted for 19.1 per cent of global final energy con-
sumption, this includes 10.1 per cent for modern renewa-
bles and 9 per cent for traditional biomass (REN21 2015: 
6). The challenge is to ‘scale up’ modern renewable energy 
production to provide a low-carbon alternative. This can 
take the form of large-scale centralised systems, like an 
offshore wind farm or a concentrating solar array, or 
decentralised generation within individual households and 
buildings. At present, most of these alternatives require 
considerable capital investment and access to advanced 
technology and they do not, therefore, offer an obvious 
solution to the fast-growing energy needs of the ‘devel-
oping world’. To provide a more global solution, those 
technologies, and the finance to purchase them, will need 
to be made available to the regions experiencing the most 
rapid increases in energy demand, i.e. the global south. 
The rapid fall in solar PV costs thanks to the expansion of 
production in China is already having a significant impact 
on the growth of solar power across the world. If similar 
developments can deliver low-cost electricity storage, then 
a renewable solution to energy access in the global south 
may be possible.
5.2.3 The changing energy mix
The balance between the various sources of energy is 
known as the energy mix. During the last century it has

reflect the energy legacies of the post-socialist states in 
Central Europe and the former Soviet Union while in 
the developing world China and India are the new major 
emitters. The past decade has seen a global shift in the 
energy system. Population growth and economic develop-
ment in countries like Brazil, India and China is driving 
up energy demand, while the developed economies are 
seeking reduced levels of energy consumption. This dif-
ferential growth rate, together with the decline in indig-
enous production in the developed world, has major 
implications for global geopolitics (Klare 2008).
There are three elements to the geography of energy 
production: the global distribution of reserves and 
production, the distribution of consumption, and the 
resultant pattern of trade between energy-surplus and 
energy-deficit regions. As noted earlier, the potential to 
produce coal, oil and natural gas is geologically deter-
mined, but the actual exploitation of a deposit depends 
on numerous factors (for a more detailed discussion, 
see Bradshaw et al. 2015). Reserve to production ratios 
(how long current reserves would last at current rates of 
production) for the three fossil fuels show that coal is 
the most abundant fossil fuel, followed by natural gas 
and then oil. World reserves of coal at the end of 2014 
would last 110 years at current rates of consumption, cur-
rent oil reserves would last 52.5 years, and natural gas 
reserves 54.1 years (BP 2015). While the OECD coun-
tries have more than sufficient coal to meet their needs, 
it is these economies that have most reduced their reli-
ance upon coal, making the developed world dependent 
upon the very fuels for which it has the lowest reserve to 
partnership with regimes whose human rights records are 
condemned by governments and NGOs in the developed 
world – the most high-profile case being Shell in Nigeria. 
Furthermore, the most attractive oilfields are reserved for 
the national oil companies (NOCs) of the reserve-holding 
states. The age of ‘easy oil’ is over for the IOCs and they 
must now make do with access to the most technologi-
cally and environmentally challenging fields. Rising costs 
and falling prices are leading many to question the future 
prospects for the IOCs.
5.2.4 The changing geography of energy production 
and consumption
Whereas in 1950 North America, Europe and the Soviet 
Union accounted for nearly 90 per cent of world energy 
demand, by 1990 their share had fallen to two-thirds 
(Jones and Hollier 1997: 181). In 1997 the member states 
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) accounted for 58.4 per cent of 
global energy consumption but by 2006 this had fallen to 
50.1 per cent and by 2014 to 42.5 per cent (Table 5.2). The 
redistribution of energy consumption has not been due 
to decline in the developed world, although during the 
1990s this was the case in the so-called ‘transition econo-
mies’, but to increased demand in the developing world 
(Table 5.3). There are substantial variations in terms of 
level of per capita energy use and energy and carbon 
intensity, with high-income countries having by far the 
highest level of energy use. The high usage levels in the 
middle-income countries and in Europe and Eurasia

Likewise, North Sea production falls well short of meet-
ing Europe’s demand for oil and is now past its peak 
production. The result is a movement of oil production 
dominated by Middle Eastern supply to Europe and 
North America and substantial movements to China and 
Japan (Figure 5.7).
The major exporters and importers of natural gas are 
listed in Table 5.5, while Figure 5.8 shows the movements 
of natural gas. The less ‘transportable’ nature of natu-
ral gas is clearly shown in Figure 5.8; for the most part 
there is a balance within each region, excepting Africa 
and the former Soviet Union (Russia and Turkmenistan), 
which have a surplus of natural gas, and Europe, which 
has a deficit. Natural gas supply into Europe is via pipe-
line from West Siberia (Russia) and North Africa or as 
LNG from North Africa. At present most of this LNG 
originates from the Asia-Pacific region, but this is chang-
ing as supply from the Middle East (Qatar) to Asia and 
from the west coast of Africa to Europe increases, and as 
new projects come online in Australia. The recent rapid 
growth of unconventional gas production, which has seen 
the US pass Russia as the world’s largest gas producer, has 
production ratios, i.e. oil and gas. This has been reduced 
in North America by the development of unconventional 
oil and gas, but Europe and Asia are likely to become ever 
more dependent upon imported oil and gas. The Mid-
dle East still accounts for the majority of the world’s oil 
reserves – 47.7 per cent at the end of 2014, with a reserve 
to production ratio of 77.8 years (BP 2015: 6). Natural 
gas reserves are dominated by the Middle East and the 
former Soviet Union where three countries, Iran, Russia 
and Qatar, account for 48.7 per cent of global reserves 
(BP 2015: 20). Thus, a large share of the world’s oil and 
gas reserves are in regions that are presently perceived to 
be politically and/or economically unstable by the major 
importing states.
The diagrams shown in Figures 5.5 and 5.6 compare 
the share of world production and consumption of oil 
and gas by major region. Asia-Pacific, Europe and North 
America are the major deficit regions, Africa, the Mid-
dle East, the former Soviet Union and South and Central 
America are the major surplus regions. Despite being the 
second largest producer in 1997, the United States still 
imports almost as much oil as it produces (Table 5.4).

dramatically reduced the need for the US to import gas 
and the US should be exporting LNG by the end of 2015.
These geographies of production and consump-
tion arise from a complex interaction of economic and 
political factors. Not surprisingly, there are substantial 
regional differences in the cost of oil production. The 
record-low oil prices of the late 1990s focused attention 
upon the actual cost of producing oil and Cambridge 
Energy Research Associates put the cost of production 
in the Middle East as low as US$2/barrel (The Econo-
mist, 4 March 1999: 29). That same report estimated the 
cost of production in Indonesia at US$6, Venezuela and 
Nigeria at US$7, Mexico at US$10, the United States and 
the North Sea at US$11 and Russia at US$14. The recent 
period of high oil price promoted exploration activity in 
high-cost locations, such as the deep water offshore in the

and used the oil embargo to punish the industrialized 
West for supporting Israel in the Arab–Israeli war the 
price of oil rapidly escalated. The first oil shock was 
followed by another in 1979–80 following the Iranian 
Revolution and a mini-shock in 1990–1 because of the 
Gulf War (see Figure 5.9). Following the second shock 
prices started to decline. There were at least three rea-
sons: first, high energy costs promoted conservation; 
second, the high price of oil and the actions of OPEC 
promoted production by high-cost non-OPEC produc-
ers; and third, recession and economic restructuring 
reduced the growth of demand in the developed world. 
As a response to very low prices, OPEC members agreed 
to cut back production, which, combined with global 
economic recovery, saw prices recover by 1999. However, 
Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Brazil. It was also 
essential to the dramatic development of unconventional 
oil and gas in North America, which itself is relatively 
expensive to produce. This prompts two questions: why 
develop high-cost fields and unconventional resources 
when the Middle East has massive reserves and very low 
production costs, and what will be the consequences of a 
prolonged period of lower oil and gas prices?
The answers lie in the realms of geopolitics as much 
as economics (see Klare 2008). Prior to the first oil 
shock of 1973–4 the industrialized world had become 
increasingly dependent upon supplies of cheap oil from 
the Middle East (Odell 1989). When the Middle East-
ern oil producers formed OPEC (the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries, see www.opec.org) 

Chapter 5  Resources, energy and development    125
principally China and India, plus tight supply as a result 
of underinvestment in the previous decade and continued 
instability in the Middle East all contributed to a short-
term ‘supply gap’. By mid-2008 a combination of tight 
markets and financial speculation in oil futures pushed 
the price to a record US$147 a barrel. Then the collapse 
of Lehman Brothers triggered a global financial crisis, 
subsequent events dramatically illustrate the volatile 
nature of oil and gas markets.
In the aftermath of 11 September 2001, a global eco-
nomic downturn kept oil prices low. Then the global 
geopolitical situation changed dramatically with the 
war in Afghanistan and then the second Iraq War. But 
despite this, a surge in demand from emerging markets, 
Case study 5.2
Energy security
At present, the United States – with something less 
than 5 per cent of the world’s total population – con-
sumes about 25 per cent of the world’s total supply of 
oil. In 2025, if current trends persist, we will be con-
suming half as much petroleum again as we do today; 
however, domestic production will be no greater than 
it is today, and so the entire increase in consumption – 
approximately 10 million barrels of oil a day – will have 
to be supplied by foreign producers. And because we 
can’t really control what goes on in those countries, 
we become hostage to their capacity to ensure an 
uninterrupted flow of petroleum.
Klare (2004: 11)
A generally accepted definition of ‘energy security’ 
is the reliable supply of energy at reasonable prices. 
As we know from discussions earlier in this chapter, 
resource scarcity is seldom about the physical short-
age of a particular resource: this is particularly true of 
oil and gas. When the first edition of this book was in 
preparation we were in a period of very low oil prices; 
today we face sustained higher oil prices. Furthermore, 
there seems to be a growing consensus that in the 
longer term we have to reduce our reliance on the 
consumption of hydrocarbons to avoid the more cata-
strophic consequences of climate change.
Despite the global economic crisis, we seem to be 
experiencing a period of pressure on global oil supplies 
because of increased demand from growing econo-
mies, such as China and India, combined with supply 
interruptions caused by hurricanes and oil leaks in 
the Gulf of Mexico, labour unrest in Nigeria, declining 
production in long-established fields and delays in bring-
ing on new fields. Thus, there is increased competition 
for access to supplies of oil and gas. Furthermore, an 
increasing share of the oil and gas consumed by the 
developed world (OECD) is imported from non-OECD 
and OPEC suppliers, particularly in the Middle East. 
In such a context, it seems that it is the business of 
national governments to devise policies to promote 
energy security. These may take the form of seek-
ing to promote energy conservation, promoting other 
sources of energy supply, promoting cooperation with, 
and investing in, oil- and gas-producing states (often via 
support for the activities of state and private oil compa-
nies) and in extremis taking military action to protect the 
supply of oil. Many would argue that since the so-called 
‘Carter Doctrine’ of 1979, when President Jimmy Carter, 
in the wake of the Soviet invasion of ­Afghanistan (see 
Spotlight box 20.1, p. 412), ‘declared that any move 
by a hostile power to acquire control over the Gulf 
region would be regarded “as an assault on the vital 
interests of the United States of America”, which would 
be opposed “by any means including military force”’ 
(quoted from Rutledge 2006: 48), US foreign policy in 
the Middle East has been all about oil (Harvey 2003; 
Klare 2004). Both President Bush and Prime Minister 
Blair denied that the invasion of Iraq was motivated by 
a desire to secure Iraqi oil production; even if it was, it 
failed as Iraqi production is now lower than before the 
war and this is helping to keep the oil price up. Whatever 
the motivations for military intervention in the Middle 
East and North Africa, it is a fact that the international 
oil market is dependent on supplies of oil from that 
region. Thus, even if the USA is less dependent on 
physical imports of oil, it is still exposed to volatility in 
the global oil market, which determines the price of its 
own crude oil. The civil war in Syria and the emergence 
of the so-called Islamic State poses a new threat to 
the stability of the oil-exporting states in the region. At 
the same time, Europe is seeking to reduce its reliance 
on imported energy from Russia, a determination that 
has been further advanced by ­Russia’s annexation of 
Crimea and the continuing conflict in eastern Ukraine 
that has resulted in sanctions being imposed on Russia.
The combination of concerns about the geopolitical 
dimension of energy security, becoming increasingly 
reliant on unreliable and potentially hostile sources of 
supply, climate change, and the need to reduce levels

demand fell and by the end of the year the price was 
below US$40 a barrel. It then recovered and for a while 
was relatively stable around the US$100 a barrel mark. 
The average price between 2011 and 2014 was US$ 107.65; 
however, in mid-2014 the price started to fall to a low of 
US$45 in January 2015. In early 2016 it was less than $30 
a barrel with little prospect of a revival. The cause of the 
latest slump is at least three-fold: the growth of uncon-
ventional oil production in North America; the unwill-
ingness of Saudi Arabia to cut back production; and the 
continued weak demand for oil. The current situation is 
a challenge for many oil exporting states, but a bonus for 
oil importing states and consumers; it also highlights the 
complex relationship between energy consumption and 
economic development and the volatility of energy prices.
5.3 Energy and development
The experience of the developed world suggests that in 
the initial phases of industrialization there is a direct link 
between increased energy consumption and economic 
development. That is, as industrial activity grows it con-
sumes more and more energy. However, in the past 40 
years it has become increasingly apparent that in the devel-
oped world the relationship between economic develop-
ment and energy consumption has changed. This is largely 
due to the processes of de-industrialization and economic 
restructuring that have seen the less energy-intensive ser-
vice sector replace heavy industry and, to a lesser degree, 
manufacturing as the major generators of wealth. At the 
same time, conservation and technological change has 
made industry more energy-efficient. Similarly, a change in 
transportation technology has increased energy efficiency; 
as a result, today’s post-industrial societies have decou-
pled the link between economic growth and increased 
energy consumption. That said, it is still the case that the 
developed world consumes a large amount of the world’s 
energy, although non-OECD primary energy consumption 
surpassed that of the OECD for the first time in 2008.
5.3.1 Energy consumption, economic development  
and climate change
The relationship between energy consumption and eco-
nomic development is usually depicted as a scatter plot 
showing the level of per capita energy consumption on 
one axis and gross national product (GNP) per capita 
on the other (Figure 5.10). The chart shows that the higher 
the level of GNP per capita the higher the level of energy 
consumption. Obvious outliers are easily explained away: 
some countries, such as the Soviet-type economies that 
had a bias towards heavy industry and were notoriously 
wasteful in their use of energy traditionally had higher 
levels of energy consumption than GNP. Others, such as 
Japan, have low levels of energy consumption but high 
GNP because they introduced energy-saving technologies 
at an early stage and moved energy-intensive industry off-
shore. Finally, there are some countries, such as Canada, 
where climatic extremes (both hot and cold) require a 
large amount of energy to be used for heating or for air 
of hydrocarbon consumption, have created a new 
energy paradigm (Helm 2007) and have also prompted 
a need to rethink the concept of energy security 
(Yergin 2006). As Daniel Yergin (2006: 70) put it in a 
highly influential article in the journal Foreign Affairs: 
‘a wider approach [to energy security] is now required 
that takes into account the rapid evolution of global 
energy trade, supply-chain vulnerabilities, terrorism, 
and the integration of major new economies in the 
world market.’ According to Yergin, this new approach 
or framework must abide by the following principles:
● Diversification of supply to reduce the impact of a 
disruption in supply from one source.
● A ‘security margin’ in the energy supply system 
that provides a buffer against shocks and facilitates 
recovery after disruptions.
● Recognition of the ‘reality of integration’, that there is 
only one global oil complex and a worldwide system 
that moves 86 million barrels of oil every day. For 
all consumers stability resides in the stability of this 
market.
● The importance of information that underpins well-
functioning markets.
In addition to these principles, Yergin (2006: 70) main-
tains that there is a need to recognize the globalization 
of the energy security system, which means that the 
developed world must engage with the likes of China 
and India, and a need to expand the concept of energy 
security to include the entire energy supply chain and 
infrastructure. In the longer term, it may be the case that 
the solution lies in developing an alternative to today’s 
hydrocarbon economy; however, for the next 30 years or 
more we will depend on oil and gas for the majority of 
our energy needs and the competition for increasingly 
scarce resources means that concerns about energy 
security can only grow. Next time you switch on the 
light think about the complex set of issues that now lies 
behind keeping the lights on!

conditioning. There are also other factors, for example 
the more urbanised a country the higher its level of per 
capita energy consumption. Finally, the size of a country 
may determine the amounts of energy that are required 
to move between places. Such an argument could be mar-
shalled to explain the very high levels of energy consump-
tion in the United States, as could climatic factors, but the 
average American household also consumes more energy 
than anywhere else in the world.
On the face of it the relationship between energy 
consumption and economic development seems unprob-
lematic. However, the whole question of what stands for 
‘development’ is itself contested (as Chapter 8 reveals). 
The measurements used in Figure 5.10 systematically 
understate the relative position of the developing world. 
First, because the use of commercial energy as a meas-
ure of energy consumption ignores the role of non-
commercial biomass energy sources, it therefore only 
measures the ‘modern’ sectors of the economy. Second, 
the monetary measure of GNP per capita inadequately 
measures the ‘human condition’ in many of the world’s 
poorest countries. That said, a more representative meas-
ure would only move them slightly ‘up the curve’ and it 
would not modify the clear relationship between indus-
trialization and energy consumption. The Stern Review 
(2006: xi) into the economics of climate change notes:
CO2 emissions per head have been strongly correlated 
with GDP per head. As a result, since 1950, North 
America and Europe have produced around 70 per cent 
of all the CO2 emissions due to energy production, 
while developing countries have accounted for less than 
one-quarter. Most future emissions growth will come 
from today’s developing countries, because of their more 
rapid population and GDP growth and their increasing 
share of energy-intensive industries.
It suggests that we need to ‘decarbonise’ development 
so that the developing world can enjoy the benefits of 
economic growth without substantially increasing global 
CO2 emissions. A report on ‘Development and Climate 
Change’ echoes this sentiment and highlights the impor-
tance of ensuring that the developing countries do not 
get ‘locked in’ to the development of high-carbon energy 
infrastructures (World Bank 2010: 190).
The historical relationship between industrialization 
and energy consumption implies that all the countries 
of the developing world will eventually follow an energy 
and development trajectory similar to the developed 
world. Thus, the patterns of energy and development 
can be equated to a stage model of the kind proposed 
by W.W. Rostow (Figure 5.11). This model examines the 
change in the energy ratio (the relationship between 
the rate of change in energy consumption and the rate 
of change in economic growth) over time as an econ-
omy develops (Mather and Chapman 1995: 154). In the 
pre-industrial phase the energy ratio is less than one, 
as these are ‘low-energy’ societies mainly dependent 
on subsistence agriculture. As discussed earlier (also 
see Chapter 2), the industrial revolution resulted in a 
change in the relationship between society and resource 
consumption; harnessing new sources of energy was at 
the heart of this process. As economies industrialize, the 
energy ratio begins to exceed one. In the early phases of

industrialization energy efficiency is low and economies 
are dominated by energy-intensive industries. As the 
industrial economy matures so the energy ratio declines 
due to increased efficiency, increased energy costs, or 
the actual decline in the level of economic activity. This 
stage is typified by the developed world during the 1970s. 
Eventually, the economy moves into a post-industrial 
phase and the ratio falls below one. If the model seems 
very familiar, it is much like that for demographic transi-
tion (see Chapter 4) because it describes the evolution of 
the energy economy as it actually occurred in Western 
Europe and the United States.
What evidence is there that the rest of the world will 
inevitably pass through the same stages? It could justi-
fiably be argued that the newly industrialized countries 
(NICs) of Asia have followed this pattern of industri-
alization; however, the time taken has been compressed 
as the NICs have tried to diversify their economies and 
promote service sector growth without the advantage 
of substantial indigenous energy resources, a fact that 
has made them vulnerable to the effects of energy price 
volatility. At present it is the rapidly growing energy 
demands of the emerging economies such as China, 
India and Brazil that is driving the growth in global 
energy demand and sustaining energy prices. With that 
have come increased CO2 emissions, making the energy 
needs of these emerging economies a major obstacle in 
global climate change negotiations. There are signs that 
China is now moving out of this energy-intensive phase 
as its economy restructures and in 2014 demand for coal 
fell 3 per cent and emissions fell for the first time since 
1999 (IEA 2014). Meanwhile, as noted earlier, a much big-
ger question mark hangs over the developing world. Is it 
inevitable that it will have to industrialize to improve liv-
ing standards? If so, then access to energy resources and/
or energy-saving and low-carbon technologies will have 
to be a central component of the development agenda in 
the twenty-first century. Furthermore, as we have seen 
in this chapter, many of those same countries are also 
likely to be the major suppliers of oil and gas and other 
minerals and there is plenty of evidence to suggest that 
such resource-based development often fails to provide a 
sustainable basis for improving living standards (see Case 
study 5.3) and can generate conflict and instability. The 
first decade of the twenty-first century suggests that the 
global shift in economic growth and energy demand is 
generating a whole series of new challenges to the exist-
ing world order.

Chapter 5  Resources, energy and development    129
Case study 5.3
Resource abundance: blessing  
or curse?
From all that has been said in this chapter, one would 
assume that having a relative abundance of natural 
resources would convey an advantage in terms of pros-
pects for economic development. However, the reality is 
somewhat different. There is now substantial evidence 
to suggest that resource-abundant economies have 
actually performed worse in terms of rates of economic 
development than resource-poor economies. The geog-
rapher Richard Auty (1993, 2001) was the first to term 
this phenomenon the ‘resource curse thesis’. Sachs 
and Warner (2001) have weighed up the evidence and 
conclude that there is sufficient evidence to suggest 
that ‘high resource intensity tends to correlate with slow 
growth’. In other words, economies that have a high 
degree of dependence on the resource sector tend to 
grow more slowly than resource-poor economies. While 
the ‘resource curse thesis’ is now generally accepted, 
there are exceptions to the rule, those usually cited 
being Botswana, Chile and Malaysia, and there is no 
single explanation for this underperformance. Sachs 
and Warner suggest that most forms of explanation 
follow some form of ‘crowding out’ logic, whereby the 
dominant resource sector inhibits the development of 
the non-resource sector. Resource economies are par-
ticularly susceptible to fluctuations in income because of 
the volatility of resource prices, added to which, as we 
know from earlier discussions, the resource base itself 
is often soon depleted. Once the ‘resource boom’ is over, 
the economy is not sufficiently developed or diversified 
to sustain living standards and a period of ‘bust’ often 
follows. Such a ‘boom and bust’ cycle is by no means 
inevitable: effective government policy can use resource 
income to promote a more diversified economy that can 
sustain living standards once the boom has passed. A 
review of the literature (Stevens 2003) suggests that 
there are number of dimensions to the ‘resource curse’ 
(though Stevens favours the term ‘resource impact’):
■ In many resource-rich economies there has been a 
failure to save income during boom periods to cover 
periods of bust (some states have created so-called 
‘stabilization funds’ to save for a rainy day), plus a 
tendency to spend income on consumption (usually 
through increased imports) and on prestige projects.
■ There is also a failure to redeploy income from the 
resource sector to promote a more sustainable 
pattern of economic development. In some instances 
there is also a tendency to use resource income 
to subsidize and protect the activity of inefficient 
producers in the non-resource sector. Later, when 
the resource income dwindles and the economy 
is opened up to international competition, these 
inefficient producers then fail.
■ In many instances, often as a consequence of a colo-
nial heritage, the resource economy remains relatively 
isolated from the rest of the economy. This minimizes 
the multiplier impact of large-scale resource-based 
investment projects, beyond their payment of taxes. 
One solution is to impose a ‘local content’ require-
ment on the resources companies, forcing them to 
use local suppliers of goods and services. However, 
given the relative lack of ‘economic development’ in 
many resource economies it is often difficult to source 
goods and services locally.
■ The increase in export income associated with a 
resource boom tends to result in a strengthening of 
the value of the domestic currency of the resource 
economy. This can have the effect of making the cost 
of domestic production in the agricultural and manu-
facturing sectors higher than the cost of imports. This 
is known as ‘Dutch Disease’ following the experience 
of the Netherlands; the net result is a decline in the 
competitiveness of the non-resource sector, which 
aggravates the problems discussed above.
■ Finally, there is increasing evidence that suggests that 
a sudden influx of resource income tends to promote 
crime and corruption, armed conflict and an abuse of 
human rights. Such problems not only have a direct 
impact on the welfare of individuals, but also promote 
increased social inequality and undermine the effec-
tiveness of the state (see Ross 2001; Renner 2002; 
Le Billon 2007).
The continuing underperformance of resource-
rich economies has led the World Bank and the 
major resource companies to reassess the impacts 
of resource development. The World Bank through 
its Extractive Industries Review (www.eireview.org) is 
reconsidering whether it should be promoting resource-
based development as a means of improving living 
standards and promoting sustainable development. 
The EIR’s final report, called Striking a Better Balance, 
concludes: ‘the Extractive Industries Review believes 
that there is still a role for the World Bank Group in the 
oil, gas and mining sectors – but only if its intervention

5.4 Conclusions: global energy 
dilemmas
This chapter has considered the nature of resources 
through a detailed study of the relationship between 
energy and economic development. We conclude by 
considering the world’s energy dilemmas. It is not just 
a matter of whether or not there is access to sufficient 
energy resources to meet demand; rather, it is a question 
as to whether the global ecosystem can absorb the con-
sequences of continued increases in energy production 
and consumption. Put simply, at the global scale and to 
avoid catastrophic climate change, can an energy system 
that delivers secure, affordable and equitable energy ser-
vices that are also environmentally benign be created? 
The exact nature of the energy dilemma varies across 
the globe, so there is no single energy dilemma, nor a 
universal solution (for further discussion of global energy 
dilemmas, see Bradshaw 2014).
In the developed market economies (including the 
Asian NICs), the energy dilemma relates to the economic 
and political costs of geopolitical scarcity and the envi-
ronmental impacts of high levels of GHG (greenhouse 
gas) emissions (see Table 5.1). Increasingly, these econo-
mies are finding themselves dependent upon what they 
perceive to be ‘hostile’ and ‘unstable’ sources of energy 
supply. The response has been to develop high-cost con-
ventional and unconventional resources close to home, 
to promote increased efficiency and conservation and to 
seek low-carbon alternatives, such as renewable energy. 
The unconventional oil and gas revolution in North 
America has certainly reduced import dependence, but 
it is also creating a new set of environmental problems, 
particularly oil sands in western Canada. The developed 
world can afford to seek technological solutions to its 
energy dilemma and it is essential that it achieves very 
substantial reductions in fossil fuel consumption and 
GHG emissions to create the atmospheric ‘headroom’ 
needed for the developing world to improve its living 
standards and constrain global warming to 2°C.
In the original global energy dilemmas framework 
presented in previous editions and elsewhere (Bradshaw 
2009, 2014), the post-socialist transition economies were 
identified as a separate group. However, it is more than 
25 years since the collapse of the Berlin wall and being 
‘post-socialist’ no longer unifies this group of coun-
tries. In Central Europe most have joined the European 
Union and are fast becoming ‘high-energy societies’ 
with their attendant problems. The southern periphery 
of the Caucasus and Central Asia now rank among the 
low- and middle-income economies of the world and 
some of them are resource-abundant economics. Both 
Belarus and Ukraine find themselves caught between an 
expanded European Union and an increasing belligerent 
Russia, whose annexation of Crimea has heightened ten-
sions with the international community and resulted in 
economic sanctions, some of which are targeted at the 
energy sector.
Russia faces its own particular set of energy dilemmas 
(Bradshaw 2014). It remains the world’s largest producer 
and exporter of hydrocarbons, but its domestic economy 
allows extractive industries to contribute to poverty alle-
viation through sustainable development and that can 
only happen if the right conditions are in place’. The EIR 
was prompted by the World Bank’s decision to finance 
the construction of the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan (BTC) 
pipeline from landlocked Azerbaijan to the Mediterra-
nean coast of Turkey. The collapse of the Soviet Union 
has prompted a dash to gain access to new energy 
resources in the Caspian and Central Asia, and more 
recently in Siberia and the Russian Far East (Kleveman 
2003). The BTC pipeline also prompted the UK govern-
ment to champion the Extractive Industries Transpar-
ency Initiative (http://eiti.org/), which is ‘a coalition of 
governments, companies, civil society groups, investors 
and international organizations. The EITI now includes 
23 countries and supports improved governance in 
resource-rich countries through the full publication and 
verification of company payments and government 
revenues from oil, gas and mining.’ High oil and gas 
prices and concerns about energy security have also 
promoted increased oil and gas activity off the shores 
of West Africa and elsewhere (Gary and Karl 2003; 
Rowell et al. 2005; Ghazvinian 2007) as the developed 
and emerging economies (China in particular) seek to 
gain control of sources of energy (Bradshaw 2009). 
Sustained high energy prices are resulting in a new 
influx of resource revenues and the expansion of oil 
and gas production into new areas will create a new set 
of resource-abundant economies and regions; NGOs 
such as Revenue Watch (www.revenuewatch.org) are 
now closely monitoring the flow of revenues arising from 
these new resource projects (see Caspian Revenue 
Watch 2003). The dangers of the resource curse are 
now well recognized, but only time will tell if the inter-
national community can assist the newly resource-rich 
economies to avoid the pitfalls of the past.

is still woefully inefficient and the state is dependent upon 
oil and gas revenues. It could pursue a path of economic 
modernisation, diversification and energy efficiency, but 
it seems more likely to continue its path of fossil fuel 
dependence, which will mean investment in both uncon-
ventional oil and Arctic oil and gas. However, it will also 
need to find new markets as Europe seeks to reduce it 
consumption of fossil fuels and its reliance on Russia in 
particular. This is well understood in Moscow and Rus-
sia’s ‘Asian Energy Pivot’ is well underway with an oil 
pipeline to the Pacific and a new pipeline – the Power of 
Siberia – to deliver gas to China.
The resource-abundant economies of the emerg-
ing and developing world face particular challenges as 
a consequence of their resource wealth. For many, but 
not all, access to revenue from oil exports has proved a 
mixed blessing. However, it would be wrong to label all 
energy-exporting economies as victims of the resource 
curse. There is a world of difference between the oil and 
gas exporting states of the former Soviet Union, the Mid-
dle East and West Africa. They all have their peculiarities, 
but all are vulnerable to the volatility of energy prices 
(though some far less so than others). Thus, for the pre-
sent at least, their energy dilemma relates to the challenge 
of using energy exports to finance a more sustainable 
model of economic development. In the longer run, these 
states must deal with the fact that climate change policies 
will reduce the demand for their principal source of rev-
enue, which makes economic diversification all the more 
imperative.
Over the last decade or so, a group of rapidly indus-
trialising economies has emerged and their rate of eco-
nomic development, population growth and urbanization 
is driving rapid growth in demand for energy services. 
Although economies such as China and India possess 
substantial energy resources of their own, they tend to 
be reliant upon coal; at the same time, the rate of demand 
growth has outstripped the capacity of their domestic 
energy industries to match demand. The net result has 
been a rapid increase in energy imports, particularly oil 
and increasingly gas. This growth in energy consump-
tion is also associated with increasing GHG emissions. 
As discussed earlier, energy- and carbon-intensive types 
of industrial activity dominate their current economic 
structures, and they have yet to decouple economic 
growth from growing energy demand. Somewhat para-
doxically, because of their very large populations, their 
per capita levels of energy consumption and CO2 emis-
sions are still low. As individual incomes increase there is 
huge potential for consumption-driven energy demand to 
increase, through car ownership, for example. Thus, the 
energy dilemma for these fast-growing economies relates, 
on the one hand, to securing the necessary energy to fuel 
continued economic development; while, on the other 
hand, ensuring that increased energy consumption does 
not result in further environmental degradation and rapid 
growth of GHG emissions.
In the developing world a dualistic pattern of resource 
consumption seems to have developed in relation to 
energy. On the one hand, there remains a ‘low-energy’ 
rural society dependent upon biomass energy and subsist-
ence agriculture, in which the majority of people exist. 
Here population pressure is leading to environmental 
problems as forests are stripped for fuel wood and land 
ploughed up or over-grazed. On the other hand, there 
exists a growing ‘high-energy’ society linked to increas-
ing commercial agricultural (see Chapter 6 for more on 
this), industrial activity and the spread of urbanization. 
In common with the colonial past, much of this activity 
is aimed at supplying natural resources and agricultural 
products (including biomass for energy production) to 
the developed and emerging economies. The two sectors 
of society combine to create an increasing demand for 
energy services, and increased pressure on the environ-
ment. The balance between the sectors also varies greatly 
among the countries of the developing world. Paradoxi-
cally, solutions to the problem of rural poverty will inevi-
tably be increased demands for energy services, though 
the absolute levels of per capita energy consumption will 
remain low.
Given that the majority of the world’s population 
lives in the emerging and developing worlds that are also 
experiencing population increase and rapid urbanization, 
the growth in energy demand in global south will be the 
major factor contributing to increases in GHG emissions 
over the coming decades. More than a decade ago, in its 
Global Environment Outlook 2000, the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP 1999: 2) concluded 
that: ‘A tenfold reduction in resource consumption in the 
industrialized countries is a necessary long-term target 
if adequate resources are to be released for the needs of 
developing countries.’ It is this increasing energy demand 
in the developing world that now raises the spectre of 
scarcity in any number of forms. To address the many 
global energy dilemmas, the developed world must 
address its own energy profligacy and at the same time 
help the developing world to shape an entirely new rela-
tionship between energy and development.

No one is untouched by the emerging environmental agenda; 
­everyone has an interest in shaping the development of 
­environmental politics (for good and bad).
(Connelly and Smith 2003: 358)
The language ‘It’s too late’ is very unsuitable for most environmental 
issues. It’s too late for the dodo and for people who’ve starved to 
death already, but it’s not too late to prevent an even bigger crisis. 
The sooner we act on the environment, the better.
(Environmental Philanthropist Jeremy Grantham in an interview with  
Leo Hickman, 2013)
When asked if I am pessimistic or optimistic about the future, my 
answer is always the same: If you look at the science about what is 
happening on Earth and aren’t pessimistic, you don’t understand data. 
But if you meet the people who are working to restore the Earth and 
the lives of the poor, and you aren’t optimistic, you haven’t got a pulse.

6.1 What kind of world do you want?
What kind of world do you want? If we don’t act now, we won’t 
have a choice. Do you want a world where climate change con-
tinues to devastate our environment?
(Friends of the Earth flyer, June 2006)
Environmentalists are often accused of being unrealis-
tic and demanding the impossible. Yet people seldom 
ask the question ‘What kind of world would we like?’ 
If we considered this a little more we might be taking 
bigger steps towards curbing our environmental impact 
and seeking environmental justice. Environmental issues 
affect all places and societies – the urban and the rural, 
the rich and the poor, nobody is unaffected. The environ-
ment matters and our impact upon it is often damaging, 
from pollution of the air that we breathe to degradation 
of the soils we rely on to grow food.
The rise of environmental activism has highlighted the 
importance of environmental protection, with some nota-
ble successes. In 2010, the British government cancelled 
plans to expand Heathrow airport, as well as refusing per-
mission for new runways at Gatwick and Stansted, and 
the logging of old-growth forests has been all but stopped 
in Western Australia. Britain has the ‘oldest, strongest, 
best-organized and most widely supported environmental 
lobby in the world’ (McCormick 1991: 34), but there are 
examples worldwide of people taking a stand and making 
changes to protect the environment. However, ‘there is no 
doubt that environmental issues have had a big impact on 
contemporary politics, and yet the frequency with which 
governments adopt a business-as-usual response to envi-
ronmental problems raises the cynical thought that per-
haps nothing much has really changed’ (Carter 2001: 2). 
Thus, despite high levels of environmental concern and 
an active environmental movement, we are faced with a 
wide array of environmental problems – from global cli-
mate change to river pollution, from water supply issues 
to nuclear power. To understand why this is, we need to 
explore: different approaches to environmental issues and 
how we value the environment; limits to growth; the com-
plexity of scale and responsibility; various strategies for 
action; what a focus on ‘the environment’ ignores; and 
finally what positive steps we should take.
6.2 How we value the environment  
and perceive environmental issues
We each value the environment in different ways and 
for different ends. Historically we have always debated 
how various parts of our human and non-human world 
should be valued. These values are used to answer ethical 
questions about the environment and non-human life; for 
example, whether we should eat meat, or whether it is 
justifiable to cut down a tree in order to burn it to heat 
a house. Understanding values helps us understand why 
some people care greatly about the environment and oth-
ers less so.
We can use three categories of value when talking 
about the environment: intrinsic, inherent and instrumen-
tal values (see Table 6.1). An object or living being has 
an instrumental value when we view it as a resource, of 
use to us for a specific end. For example, a forest has an 
instrumental value if we view it just as a source of wood 
for fuel. At the other end of the continuum an element 
has intrinsic value if we view it as important in and of 
itself, with no reference to how we might use it or to how 
it might make us feel. For example, people generally view 
human life as intrinsically valuable.
In between these, inherent value (sometimes referred 
to as ‘weak’ instrumental value) refers to how we value 
something beyond its use as a resource but still relate 
value to how the thing makes us feel. For example, we 
might value a woodland because we enjoy walking 
through it and feel less stressed after doing so.
We can understand this better if we consider the 
rule of no-substitution. If something is instrumentally 
valuable, its value will disappear if there is a preferable 
substitute. For example, wind and water power was 
replaced by steam engines in mills in nineteenth-century 
Britain because they were more reliable, efficient, and 
flexible in terms of where mills could be located. But 
if something is inherently valuable for itself, and not 
as an end, it is not substitutable in this way. Hinchliffe 
and Belshaw (2003) use the example of the wild tiger 
to illustrate the consequences of these values. The wild 
tiger population is threatened by the international trade

in tiger parts, often for use in Chinese medicine. One 
solution is to establish tiger farms. However, if we find 
such farms acceptable that implies an instrumental val-
uation of tigers. If tigers’ inherent value is paramount, 
then the notion of farming becomes objectionable. 
The implications of such values are also explored in  
Case study 6.1.
We can also consider the values we accord the envi-
ronment by understanding the terms ‘anthropocentrism’ 
and ‘ecocentrism’. At its most extreme, an anthropo-
centric approach views only humans as having intrinsic 
value and the environment as having only instrumental 
value. In other words, the environment is only useful as 
a resource for humans, and environmental sustainability 
is only considered for the sake of human welfare. Eco-
centrism critiques anthropocentrism and suggests that 
non-human entities have intrinsic value. However, for 
many people the situation is not this black and white. 
There is a large range of intermediate views, within 
which some non-human entities have value, others do 
not, but humans are valued as more important than the 
environment. Thus there is a continuum between these 
approaches, just as there is between ‘deep’ and ‘shallow’ 
ecology (Naess 1973). Shallow ecology is an anthropo-
centric position. Deep ecology, as defined by Naess, 
is a form of ecocentrism but one where everything has 
intrinsic value (see Table 6.2 for the eight basic princi-
ples of deep ecology). The approach asks us to consider 
humans not only as part of nature but also of equal value 
to non-human entities. This is a holistic vision whereby 
all human and non-human entities are interconnected 
and interdependent. A holistic perspective enables us to 
understand that if we upset one element it will have an 
impact on all other elements. If we were to adopt such 
an approach it would require us to make radical changes 
to the way we live.
How we value the environment is not the only influ-
ence on how we relate to it and perceive environmental 
issues. There is evidence for gender differences associ-
ated with environmentalism; for example, a review by 
Zelezny et al. (2000) showed that stronger pro-environ-
mental attitudes and behaviour among women than men 
are found in Spain and 13 countries in North and South 
America. They suggest that gender differences in pro-
environmental behaviour (PEB) arise because of the 
Instrumental value

Value something has for someone, but not as a means to a further end
Intrinsic value
Simply the value something has. No appeal need be made to those for whom it has value

Old-growth logging in Tasmania, 
Australia
The logging of old-growth forests is a particularly 
controversial issue in Australia, with views sharply 
polarized (Hutton and Connors 1999). Old-growth 
forests have experienced only minimal human interfer-
ence, take hundreds of years to grow and contain the 
tallest plants on earth. They are often considered to be 
of high conservation value.
The state government of Tasmania has shown little 
inclination to curb the logging of old-growth forests. This 
is despite a consultation process (Tasmania Together) 
where the population voted to end deforestation. In 
May 2003 the government lifted a ban on logging in 
the Tarkine – the single greatest stretch of temperate 
rainforest in Australia. The forests of the south-east and 
north-east are also threatened by expanding logging 
operations. Every year approximately 15,000 hectares 
of old-growth forest are logged in Tasmania.
In a country which draws much of its wealth from its 
natural resources (forests, minerals, uranium, fishing 
and agriculture), logging is often justified by the need 
to provide jobs in rural areas and earn export revenue. 
Loggers argue that Australia has limited resources 
and therefore needs to make the most profitable use 
of them; that they have historically ‘managed’ forests 
through selective logging, consequently arguing that all 
forests in Tasmania have been influenced by humans 
for generations.
Environmentalists have argued that logging is simply 
a waste of resources. Logging in Tasmania is heav-
ily subsidized and uneconomical (not only in the price 
obtained for products but in its negative impact upon 
tourism). Most of the wood is sold as woodchips to 
be made into paper. Moreover it is unsustainable and 
irreversible and many of the trees destroyed would 
take over 300 years to regrow, e.g. the Houn Pine in the 
south-west of the island takes 3,000 years to grow to 
full size. Old-growth forests cannot simply be replaced; 
their destruction results in the loss of biodiversity 
of a barely understood and fragile ecosystem. Defor-
estation does not only have localized effects but also 
plays a key role in reducing carbon dioxide absorption 
and can upset hydrological systems beyond the area 
of logging. Environmentalists also believe that the 
largest trees are important in and of themselves. The 
Wilderness Society, a key environmental group in the 
Australian logging debate says, ‘our forests are places 
that inspire and rejuvenate us all – nurturing us as well 
as the delicate ferns and mosses on the forest floor, 
or connecting us to timeless grandeur as we touch the 
tallest flowering plants on Earth’ (2006).
The campaigns to save the old-growth forests have 
ranged from small-scale local protests to garnering 
international support. The Styx Valley in the south-east 
is an example of an iconic campaign. It contains the 
world’s tallest hardwood trees – Eucalyptus regnans. 
Many are taller than a 25-storey building. The forest is 
also home to many native species of wildlife, including 
the majestic Wedge-tailed Eagle and the Yellow-tailed 
Black Cockatoo. While a few of the largest trees in 
the valley have been protected, between 300 and 600 
hectares are being logged each year. Furthermore the 
main form of logging is destructive clear felling and 
burning (not ­selective logging).
Action on a local level has involved occupying threat-
ened trees and targeting the woodchip mills. Region-
ally, environmentalists have been using their research 
to argue against clear fell logging, and to prove the 
environmental implications of logging. Environmental-
ists have appealed to the federal government and the 
Australian populace for support through media cam-
paigns and advertising. In 2013 there was an historic 
breakthrough in the 30-year-long campaign against 
old-growth logging, when environmentalists, timber 
communities, forest unions, state government and the 
logging industry jointly signed the Tasmanian Forests 
Intergovernmental ­Agreement on how a sustainable 
timber industry could be created while also protecting 
the remaining old-growth forests. The agreement would 
protect key old-growth forests like the Tarkine and Styx 
Valley, amongst others. The main logging company – 
Gunns – promised to end its operations in the state. 
The agreement requires the state government to finan-
cially support workers and contractors to stop logging, 
and to implement legal changes to safeguard forests 
as formal reserves to the same level of protection as 
national parks. This is the first time that all the protago-
nists have come to an agreement, and it is likely to sig-
nal the end of old-growth logging in Tasmania.
Analysis of the conflicts about protection of forests 
enables us to understand how the environment is 
valued differently within a community; in other words, 
why some argue for its protection and others choose 
its destruction. The state government and logging

different cultural types demonstrate different patterns of 
consumption. These views and consumption patterns are 
shown in Figure 6.1.
Cultural theory and the associated myths of nature can 
help explain why individuals vary in their perception of 
the risks of environmental issues such as climate change, 
and their responses to them (Hulme 2009). For example, 
Steg and Sievers (2000) found that individuals who regard 
nature as finely balanced (the egalitarian view) showed 
more awareness of the problems of car use, felt more 
responsibility for those problems, were more likely to 
agree that reducing car use is necessary, and stated more 
support for policy measures to reduce car use than other 
types, particularly those who view nature as ‘benign’ (the 
individualist view). Marshall (2007) uses the theory to 
suggest that different messages are needed to motivate 
individuals to adopt lower-carbon lifestyles, depending 
on their consumption preferences. While egalitarians 
greater socialization females experience to be socially 
responsible and to care about others. Older people also 
score higher for various types of PEB (Olli et al. 2001). 
This may be due to the social conditions which shaped 
their habits; many older people in Britain, for example, 
experienced rationing and grew up with a ‘waste not, 
want not’ mentality that is less prevalent now.
Cultural theory asserts that there are different ‘cul-
tural types’ of people, differentiated by whether they 
have a preference for – or feel bound by – strong or weak 
societal rules and hierarchical structures, and strong or 
weak ‘group’ features of society (ties to others; sense 
of community). The theory posits that each of the four 
cultural types – hierarchists, egalitarians, individualists, 
and fatalists – has a different view (or ‘myth’) of nature 
and a different preferred management style for deal-
ing with environmental (and other) problems (Steg and 
Sievers 2000). Dake and Thompson (1999) showed that 
companies clearly view the forests as a resource for 
use by humans, thus they believe they have an instru-
mental value. They will only be interested in managing 
forests sustainably if that will add value to their use and 
exploitation in years to come. For environmentalists it 
is more complex. On one level, many acknowledge the 
instrumental value of forests (for making furniture, for 
example) but think the current methods of forestry are 
wasteful. But in addition environmentalists believe the 
environment has an inherent value (as demonstrated 
by the Wilderness Society’s recognition of the reju-
venating effects of being in forests), and an intrinsic 
value which is not related to human need. Therefore 
many believe old-growth forests should be protected 
from all but recreation, and left untouched for future 
generations to enjoy.
Q   How do you value forests like those in Tasmania 
and how does that affect your perspective as a 
geographer?
1
The well-being and flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth have value in themselves (synonyms: 
intrinsic value, inherent value). These values are independent of the usefulness of the non-human world for 
human purposes.
2
Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in 
themselves.
3
Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs.
4
The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human 
population. The flourishing of non-human life requires such a decrease.
5
Present human interference with the non-human world is excessive and the situation is rapidly worsening.
6
Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological and ideological 
structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.
7
The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations on inherent value) 
rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the 
difference between big and great.
8
Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try and implement the 
necessary changes.

One of the main factors that differentiates beliefs 
about climate change is political affiliation, with con-
servatives more likely to be sceptical about the reality of 
human-induced climate change than others. This is par-
ticularly true in the USA, where there has been a widen-
ing gap between Democrats and Republicans in terms of 
attitudes and beliefs about climate change in the last few 
years (Dunlap and McCright 2008). Feygina et al. (2010) 
argue that the ‘conservative white male’ effect of denial 
of environmental problems occurs because conservative 
white men are more likely to defend and justify the soci-
etal status quo when faced with the threat posed by envi-
ronmental issues, since they have a stronger preference for 
things as they are than other people (women, liberals, and 
ethnic minorities). But it is possible to combat the nega-
tive effects of system justification on environmentalism 
(whom he names strivers) will respond to typical envi-
ronmental messages to ‘save the planet’, individualists 
(he calls them winners) will find these kind of appeals 
off-putting, and instead need to be persuaded that high-
carbon lifestyles will go out of fashion and that savvy 
consumers buy low-carbon technologies such as electric 
cars. We should stress to hierarchists, or traditionalists 
as Marshall calls them, that climate change will threaten 
things they value such as the countryside, but solutions 
to climate change will be actions they already support, 
like holidaying in Britain and buying British food. And 
because fatalists (or ‘survivors’) feel little control over 
their own lives and often have little money, the message 
for them needs to emphasize that energy saving measures 
save money and that being prepared for climate change 
will mean it doesn’t make life even harder.

can make a difference by engaging in pro-environmental 
behaviour, are cornerstones of modern environmental 
thought. Another key insight is that there are limits to 
growth. The earth is a finite system and thus growth in 
use of resources and production of wastes cannot con-
tinue indefinitely. This was highlighted by Meadows et 
al. in 1972 with the publication of Limits to Growth. 
Using computer models they sought to project trends in 
resource use and population growth into the future. They 
predicted natural limits on future growth and two of their 
simulated scenarios ended in environmental catastro-
phe by the mid to latter part of the twenty-first century. 
Although the report has been criticized for being overly 
pessimistic, defenders say that elements of the projec-
tions are similar to observed data so far, and the idea of 
limits and finitude (scarcity rather than abundance) has 
remained important.
However, it also became apparent, for people in the 
minority world at least, that it was possible to maintain 
economic growth and reduce resource consumption per 
unit of wealth created. This argument resulted in the 
emergence of an alternative view to ecocatastrophism: 
a view that would develop into the concept of sustainable 
development (see Spotlight box 6.1).
Connelly and Smith (2003) identify two broad inter-
pretations of what an environmentally sustainable soci-
ety would look like: a deep green approach, and the 
more reformist ecological modernization. The deep 
green interpretation is a radical approach that calls for 
change and restructuring at all levels of society in politi-
cal, economic and social arenas. In essence it is a critique 
of everything about the way we currently live today, a 
critique of contemporary consumerist society and free-
market capitalism. In this understanding of sustainable 
development, accepting that there are limits to growth 
means changing our notions of what makes a good life 
and learning to live more simply (thus slowing growth): 
by presenting PEB as patriotic and as a means of preserv-
ing the status quo.
The conservative white male effect reveals something 
very interesting about the way individuals think about 
environmental issues. While we might expect beliefs and 
risk perceptions about a problem to affect what people 
consider we should do about it, and how they themselves 
are willing to respond, the political split about various 
environmental issues shows that the reverse is also true. 
Views on action in response to environmental problems 
(e.g. whether or not it is patriotic) can influence whether 
people believe the problem exists, and how concerned they 
feel about it. This is one of many reasons that simply giv-
ing people information about a problem does not neces-
sarily lead them to change their behaviour or campaign 
for government action in response. If they do not want to 
accept the implications of the issue for their own lifestyle, 
or do not support government legislation to tackle the 
problem, they are likely to ignore or reject the information.
The ‘information-deficit model’ – the idea that people 
who do not feel concerned about an environmental prob-
lem, or are not acting in response to it, simply don’t know 
enough about it and therefore more information is the 
answer – has been criticised for many other reasons. For 
example, people do not tend to take action unless they feel 
a sense of agency, which has two aspects. The first is the 
belief that it is possible to take action oneself; people who 
have this sense of personal control are more likely to engage 
in PEB than those who see control residing in an external 
source beyond their influence (Jonsson and Nilsson 2014). 
The second aspect of agency is a belief that taking action 
will make a difference and therefore is worth doing. Evalu-
ating the UK government’s ‘Helping the Earth Begins at 
Home’ campaign, Hinchliffe (1996) noted that many peo-
ple he spoke to expressed a sense of futility about taking 
individual action because they didn’t believe others would 
do so. Acting together with others in a group helps to create 
a feeling of agency (see Case study 6.4 for an example). The 
social norms that operate in our society and peer groups are 
another important influence on our perceptions of envi-
ronmental issues and the way we respond to them (Smith 
et al. 2012). By engaging in PEB we help to change what is 
perceived as ‘normal’ in society and therefore our actions 
can have bigger effects than we might think.

challenge of capitalism

centric approach whereby the environment is viewed

Low-impact living in Britain
Low-impact living (LIL) is a form of living that 
enables people to reduce or even minimize the envi-
ronmental impact of their daily lives. Those advocating 
LIL often build houses from local, natural and recycled 
materials and in rural areas ensure they have a low 
visual impact by blending with their surroundings. Many 
developments aim to generate their own renewable 
energy and deal with their own waste (through recy-
cling and composting). In addition LIL is about more 
than just environmentally friendly buildings: it is about a 
way of life. Implicit in the LIL approach is an emphasis 
on minimizing vehicle use, reducing consumption and 
purchasing goods locally, growing food, and, in rural 
areas, creating livelihoods largely from the land.
In Britain there is a growing number of LIL pro-
jects. Hockerton Housing Project in Nottinghamshire 
is an earth-sheltered, self-sufficient terrace of five 
single-storey houses. Built into the side of a hill 
with large windows to the south, they rely solely 
on passive solar heating and generate all their 
electricity through wind turbines and photovoltaic 
systems. The houses are highly energy-efficient and 
waste is disposed of through a reed-bed system into 
a large lake. They also grow their own vegetables 
and generate income through education. Another 
example is Tony Wrench’s roundhouse at Brithdir 
Mawr, south-west Wales (Plate 6.4). This is built from 
home-grown timber, straw and earth. It is built into 
the earth with a turf roof so that, from behind, you 
can hardly see it. It is highly insulated, has recycled

Sustainable development
The 1987 Brundtland Report adopted the position 
that it was possible to pursue economic growth without 
compromising the environment, and it provided the first, 
still widely used, definition of sustainable development: 
‘development which meets the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability of future generations 
to meet their own needs’.
However, this definition is highly contested and 
vague, leading to weak interpretations. For example, 
how can present and future needs be determined, and 
whose needs does it refer to? Many attempts have been 
made to refine the concept, which have led to numerous, 
often contradictory, definitions. The result is that ‘sus-
tainable development’ is often little more than a sound-
bite, signalling recognition that the environment matters 
but failing to provide substance.
The real success of the Brundtland Report was 
the emphasis it placed on the relationships between 
economic growth, social conditions and environmen-
tal degradation, an emphasis that placed sustainable 
development firmly on the global political agenda. 
Sustainable development is therefore often under-
stood as involving three elements: economic, social, 
and environmental sustainability. These are sometimes 
conceptualized as three separate but equally neces-
sary ‘pillars’ of sustainability, but another perspective 
is to view the economy as a subsystem of human soci-
ety, which in turn is dependent on the biosphere. This 
is represented by a diagram of three nested circles, 
economy inside society, inside environment, empha-
sizing that these are not separate domains of action 
(see Figure 6.2). Product standards that refer to these 
three elements of sustainable development include 
the Fairtrade mark and Rainforest Alliance certifica-
tion. Culture is now increasingly recognized as a fourth 
aspect of sustainable development.

own needs, e.g. through growing your own vegetables. See 
Case study 6.2 for a British example of low-impact living.
The ecological modernization interpretation is far less 
radical and has been adopted by many more in main-
stream politics. Supporters of ecological modernization 
criticize the deep green vision as naive and utopian with 
an unnecessary and ineffective focus on localization. In 
essence this approach argues that economic growth does 
not need to be slowed to ensure environmental protec-
tion. It does not undermine the limits to growth thesis 
entirely, but suggests that we can ‘reorient’ economic 
growth and find technological solutions for environ-
mental problems, or ‘decouple’ economic growth from 
increased energy use, pollution and waste, thus overcom-
ing the environmental impact of growth. It is a very weak 
interpretation of sustainable development that allows 
for a reformist response where the current dominance of 
free-market capitalism is not challenged; ‘the future of 
environmental politics on this reading is a technical ques-
tion of how to make capitalism more environmentally 
sensitive’ (Connelly and Smith 2003: 359).
The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypoth-
esis states that although pollution and environmental 
degradation initially increase with increasing per capita 
for example, consuming less overall but more locally pro-
duced goods, generating less waste, travelling less and 
being conscious of our impact on the environment in our 
daily lives. The result is an emphasis on ‘localization’, 
living small-scale, perhaps more communally to share the 
load of everyday tasks, in energy-efficient buildings, and 
often with importance attached to producing for your

windows and uses a wood burner and passive  
solar heating.
It has often been very difficult to get planning per-
mission in Britain for LIL projects. Many rural communi-
ties have secretly constructed their dwellings or fought 
long retrospective planning battles to keep their homes. 
However, on 13 July 2006, eight years after the dis-
covery of ecohouses at Brithdir Mawr and the ensuing 
planning controversy, Pembrokeshire County Council 
and Pembrokeshire National Park adopted an innova-
tive policy on low-impact development. This explicitly 
allows rural greenfield development under a number 
of conditions aimed to ensure developments remain 
low impact. Development must be highly sustainable, 
using local, renewable, recycled and/or natural mate-
rials and built to high standards of eco-design, with 
the emphasis on ‘low impact’, including visual effects. 
Moreover, the proposal must offer positive environmen-
tal, social and/or economic contributions with public 
benefit. These could include services to the community, 
economic diversification for the area, opening paths 
for walkers or improved biodiversity. Furthermore, resi-
dents must prove a need to be on the land (rather than 
clustered within existing rural settlements). In 2009 the 
first large-scale new eco-village was approved under 
this policy. Lammas eco-village (www.lammas.org.uk) is 
a low-cost nine-house community on 76 acres of mixed 
pasture and woodland next to the village of Glandwr, 
Pembrokeshire.
LIL projects don’t have to be in rural areas. LILAC 
(Low Impact Living Affordable Community; www.lilac.
coop) was built in Leeds in 2013, and includes 20 
households and a common house. The buildings are 
made of locally sourced super-insulated straw bale 
and timber panels. Residents grow food on their allot-
ments next to the buildings, share tools and resources, 
and get together for shared meals and events to 
build a sense of community. Beddington Zero Energy 
Development (BedZED) in London consists of 82 
homes plus work space, built in 2000–2002. Although 
there have been some problems (e.g. with the biomass 
Combined Heat and Power plant), BedZED residents 
use 45 per cent less electricity and 81 per cent less gas 
for heating per year than the average for the borough 
they live in, and less than half the local average of 
mains water (Hodge and Haltrecht 2009).
Q   What measures should we put in place to ensure 
our buildings, and the way we live in them, have 
minimal environmental impact?

142    Section 2  Population, resources, food, the environment and development
and Nature, George Perkins Marsh presented evidence 
for negative consequences of tropical deforestation. 
Carter (2001) has categorized the evolution of environ-
mental issues (Table 6.3) into three key periods. Pre-1960s 
a great deal of environmental concern was focused upon 
small-scale localized problems such as local pollution and 
wildlife protection. In the 1960s concern grew about the 
interrelation between human actions and more complex 
environmental impacts. For example, Silent Spring, writ-
ten by the biologist Rachel Carson in 1962 is generally 
regarded as a milestone in modern environmentalism. 
Carson pointed out the long-term ecological conse-
quences of intensive agriculture, particularly the ways in 
which synthetic pesticides (notably DDT) persist in the 
food chain and poison birds and mammals (including 
humans). At the same time there were growing concerns 
about overpopulation. Paul Ehrlich, Garrett Hardin 
and Barry Commoner were considered neo-Malthusian 
because they saw environmental problems as a conse-
quence of population growth, following the arguments 
set out by Thomas Malthus in the late eighteenth cen-
tury. The misguided simplicity of neo-Malthusian expla-
nations of environmental problems is shown in studies 
that have tried to explain land degradation in terms of 
population dynamics (Boserüp 1990). Not only is the 
evidence contradictory, for example increased land deg-
radation in northern China has been linked to population 
growth (Takeuchi et al. 1995), whereas in northern Yemen 
(Carapico 1985) and Kenya’s Machakos Hills (Tiffin et al. 
1994) it has been related to population decline, but also it 
is clear from these studies that linking land degradation 
to one explanatory parameter – population size – masks 
income, once a country becomes rich enough it begins 
to implement environmental protection measures and 
the damage is reversed. Thus ecological modernizers 
argue that economic growth is necessary, to ensure both 
a decent material standard of living and environmental 
protection. But the theory appears to hold true only for 
some local pollutants and measures of air quality (Dinda 
2004). Ecological footprint measures are highest in the 
richest countries of the world, for example, and Dietz 
and Adger (2003) found that an EKC does not exist for 
biodiversity loss. It may be that the EKC hypothesis only 
works when industrialization, urbanization and eco-
nomic development cause environmental problems that 
have very obvious local impacts, such as the pollution of 
rivers by sewage and chemicals. As people become richer 
they have higher expectations regarding their local envi-
ronment and urge protection of it, but environmental 
problems that are less obvious, or have impacts far from 
home, do not gain so much attention or response.
The EKC hypothesis has also been criticized on the 
grounds that the apparent improvement in measures 
of environmental health may be due to rich countries 
‘exporting’ their pollution and energy consumption 
abroad (Suri and Chapman 2008). The reduction in 
UK greenhouse gas emissions has been achieved partly 
through the decline in British manufacturing and 
increased reliance on imported goods; emissions associ-
ated with the latter are not counted as part of the UK’s 
carbon footprint but may be higher in poorer countries 
with more lax environmental regulations. Thus globali-
zation and free-market capitalism pose a real challenge 
to our ability to adjust to the reality of limits to growth.
6.4 The complexity of scale  
and responsibility
The scale of response to environmental issues is a key 
point of debate. As we have seen, deep greens argue that 
localization is one of the most important elements to 
enacting environmental sustainability. If we adopt a more 
localized lifestyle then we can minimize our environmen-
tal impact. However, our environmental problems are far 
more complex, and global, than the notion of ‘localiza-
tion’ suggests. To understand this we need to explore the 
evolution of environmental concern from one of local 
problems to global environmental issues.
There is no clear beginning to environmental concern. 
Plato, Lucretius and Caesar all noted the problems of soil 
erosion. Many of today’s most pressing environmental 
issues were first identified in the nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries. For example, in his 1869 book Man

a wider, less quantifiable impact on environmental issues 
worldwide, particularly in that:
● it elevated the importance of the environment on the 
political agendas of most countries (the majority now 
participate in the conventions that were agreed to at 
Rio, and many have used these conventions to pass 
new environmental legislation);
● the multilateral negotiations led to some issues gain-
ing internationally important status (perhaps most 
notably biodiversity loss, which had only been recog-
nized by scientists some 12 years earlier), and which 
changed long-standing, often ineffective attitudes to 
nature conservation;
● legislation at the international scale was negoti-
ated, heralding an era of global environmental 
policy-making;
● there was recognition that many stakeholders had 
legitimate voices in environmental policy-making (the 
recognition of the stakeholder principle was vital in 
allowing actors outside government to become effec-
tive in bringing about changes in environment and 
development, a point that proponents of the bottom-
up approach to development had long argued for).
Each of the three main conventions agreed at Rio has 
been followed by annual conferences of the parties (i.e. 
the countries that have signed a convention), at which 
progress towards ratification and implementation of the 
conventions has been discussed. Whilst the Convention to 
Combat Desertification and the Convention on Biologi-
cal Diversity proved relatively straightforward to ratify 
and implement, negotiations arising from the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change have been beset by disa-
greements (see Case study 6.3).
The Earth Summit was followed by the World Summit 
on Sustainable Development (‘Rio+10’) in 2002 and the 
United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development 
(‘Rio+20’) in 2012. These conferences were not as ground-
breaking as the original; in 2002 the USA did not attend, 
and the main outcome of Rio+20 was a non-binding docu-
ment, The Future We Want. In it the heads of state of the 
192 governments attending reaffirmed their commitment 
to sustainable development and to previous action plans.
Although a few governments have found it difficult to 
ratify conventions and make efforts to achieve targets, 
the implementation of sustainable development actions 
by local administrations – Local Agenda 21s – has been 
far more successful. The International Council for Local 
Environment Initiatives (2002) reported that 6,416 LA21s 
were underway or committed to in 113 countries, that 
national campaigns were underway in 18 countries, and 
that formal stakeholder groups had been established in 
73 per cent of administrative units with LA21s.
the complexity behind population dynamics and labour-
land relationships (Millington et al. 1989). Environmen-
tal problems are in fact a function of consumption of 
resources and production of wastes, as well as population 
and other factors.
By the early 1970s there was recognition not just of 
the interconnectedness of environmental issues, and of 
the problems of cumulative damage, but also that these 
were global problems that needed internationally coor-
dinated responses. Environmental scientists identify two 
types of global environmental change. On the one hand, 
systemic change occurs when there is a direct impact 
on a physically interconnected, global system, e.g. the 
atmosphere or the oceans: for example, the effects 
that increased emissions of greenhouse gases have on 
global climate. Cumulative change, on the other hand, 
occurs when many discrete events become significant 
because their distribution is global or because, added 
together, their impact is felt across a large proportion 
of the globe. For example, across the Americas, Africa 
and Asia-Pacific, the relatively small amounts of tropi-
cal forest lost in each area being converted from forest 
to farmland, or being lost to a mining operation, add 
up to a global-scale problem affecting humid tropical 
forests, one of the most biodiverse biomes found on 
earth, of vital significance to the global water and car-
bon balances. Recognition of this duality is important 
in formulating policies and strategies. Addressing sys-
temic issues need to be a global effort, with all countries 
agreeing and adhering to action. Focusing on cumulative 
issues requires both global approaches (e.g. in the fields 
of data exchange and comparative research) and local 
strategies (to reduce the impacts of a problem because 
different causes may exist in different geographical loca-
tions) (Middleton 2003).
In 1992, after five years of negotiations and prepara-
tory meetings, the UN Conference on Environment and 
Development (also known as the Earth Summit) was 
held in Rio de Janeiro. It brought together 172 govern-
ment delegations, 108 heads of state or government, 
2,400 NGO representatives and a press corps of nearly 
10,000. The parallel NGO Forum, which had consultative 
status, was attended by 17,000 people (see www.un.org/
geninfo/bp/enviro.html). A rift opened up between the 
representatives of the majority world and the minority 
world countries, the former being worried that environ-
mental concerns would be used by the minority world to 
limit their development. Shifting tensions between geo-
political blocs developed over issues such as biodiversity, 
climate change and desertification. But whatever its fail-
ings, the key point is that the Earth Summit resulted in a 
number of specific agreements that now form the basis of 
a global strategy for sustainable development and it had

Negotiating and implementing an 
international convention: the obsta-
cles faced in tackling climate change
The latest scientific report by the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change states that warming of the 
climate system is ‘unequivocal’. Atmospheric concen-
trations of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon diox-
ide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide are higher than 
they have been for at least the last 800,000 years. Their 
effects are ‘extremely likely’ (95–100 per cent probabil-
ity) to have been the main cause of observed climate 
change since the mid-twentieth century (IPCC 2014).
The United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) was created at the Rio 
Earth Summit in 1992 and came into force on 21 March 
1994 (see www.unfcc.int for further details). The ultimate 
objective of the UNFCCC is to ‘stabilize greenhouse 
gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that 
will prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human induced) 
interference with the climate system. Such a level should 
be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow eco-
systems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure 
that food production is not threatened and to enable 
economic development to proceed in a sustainable 
manner’. Annual conferences of the parties (COPs) are 
attended by all the states that have ratified or acceded to 
the Convention (196 as of November 2014).
The third COP, held in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 
saw agreement on the Kyoto Protocol, which was 
intended to commit all industrialized nations to reduce 
their emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2008–12. 
Although the Protocol was signed in Bonn in July 2001, 
it did not come into force until 16 February 2005 after 
Russia ratified it, therefore ensuring the requirement 
was met that it was ratified by at least 55 countries 
producing at least 55 per cent of global emissions in 
1990. However, the USA, the world’s second- largest 
emitter of CO2 after China, has never signed up to the 
Kyoto Protocol, and the original targets were reduced 
during the Bonn meeting to ensure that Japan, Canada 
and Australia would agree. Ultimately, 37 industrialized 
nations (and the European Community as a whole) 
were bound by targets during the first Kyoto commit-
ment period. These varied between countries, to reflect 
the ease or difficulty of reducing emissions, what had 
already been done, and what countries would accept. 
Japan and Canada had a 6 per cent reduction target 
while Norway, Australia and Iceland were actually 
allowed to increase their emissions from 1990 levels. 
The European Union committed to an 8 per cent reduc-
tion, to be shared out between members; Germany and 
Denmark promised to reduce emissions by 21 per cent 
each, while the UK agreed to 12.5 per cent and poorer 
countries such as Portugal and Greece were allowed to 
increase emissions. Not surprisingly, a complex set of 
rules and regulations surrounds the targets, making it 
possible to trade ‘emissions reductions’ between states. 
One means of doing this is the clean development 
mechanism (CDM), through which minority world 
countries are able to earn credits towards their own 
reduction targets by investing in emission reduction 
projects in the majority world. In other words, the minor-
ity world will have to help the majority world implement 
the CDM and this will require transfer of considerable 
amounts of capital and technology. Thus O’Riordan 
(2000: 202) notes that:
the CDM mechanism denies the right of Third World 
nations to select their own CO2 future. This is ‘ecologi-
cal colonialism’ by another name. While the minority 
world has access to the capital and technology to 
achieve the Kyoto targets, it still requires the political 
will. In the majority world, political will amounts to lit-
tle without the material requirements to balance the 
economic growth with environmental needs.
There are now significant concerns as to the efficacy 
of this mechanism. The Copenhagen Accord agreed in 
2009 has done little to quell these fears, being widely 
regarded as too weak and vague to really tackle these 
key concerns. Although there were similar criticisms of 
the outcomes of the Cancun climate talks in 2010, pro-
gress was made in establishing a new Green Climate 
Fund. This is intended to raise and distribute £64 billion 
a year by 2020 to assist in technology transfer and low-
carbon development for the poorer countries.
Overall the Kyoto Protocol should have achieved 
an average reduction in GHG emissions of 5 per cent 
from 1990 levels by the end of 2012, for those coun-
tries involved. Whether this has been accomplished 
depends on exactly how emissions are counted. Under 
the rules of the Protocol, only emissions produced in a 
country count towards its total, and using this ‘produc-
tion perspective’ many countries (including the UK) 
have met their targets. However, from a ‘consumption 
perspective’, which assigns GHGs associated with 
imported goods to the country consuming them rather 

Chapter 6  The environment and environmentalism    145
example, if we want to reduce the negative consequences 
of driving cars we can reduce individual use, encourage 
companies to design more fuel-efficient vehicles, and 
lobby governments to increase the price of petrol through 
tax rises, subsidize eco-alternatives and introduce road 
pricing. However, in practice, governments of countries 
like the USA have argued in the past that it would dam-
age their economy, making them less globally competitive 
(leading to job losses).
All these complexities are shaped by how we value the 
environment, at what scale we view these problems, and 
thus whose responsibility we believe it is to make changes. 
While many individuals, NGOs and governments argue 
The problem of scale can make it hard to determine 
how to take the best action. Not only do we need to 
unpack the causes of environmental change and identify 
likely solutions, but also ‘those making decisions con-
cerning global environmental problems need to consider 
the ramifications for national economies and local popu-
lations’ (Harris 2004: 13). In other words, we (individuals, 
businesses, nations, etc.) need to take responsibility for 
our environmental impacts and understand the conse-
quences of mitigating these problems (for other people, 
the economy, and so on). The problem of climate change 
is thus ‘a local and social problem as much as it is a 
global environmental problem’ (Barnett 2007: 1361). For 
than the producer country, emissions reductions are 
more than cancelled out by the GHGs ‘embedded’ in 
imports from the majority world (Peters et al. 2011).
COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009 was supposed to 
result in a new set of post-2012 binding reduction com-
mitments. This didn’t happen; all that was agreed was 
the Copenhagen Accord, a set of non-binding, voluntary 
targets. Furthermore, Canada withdrew from the Kyoto 
Protocol in 2011 to avoid heavy financial penalties that 
it would otherwise face as it would not meet its emis-
sions reductions targets, while Japan and Russia stated 
that they would not take on further targets. ‘The Kyoto 
Protocol does not cover the world’s largest two emitters, 
the United States and China, and therefore cannot work,’ 
argued Canadian Environment Minister Peter Kent. In 
2010 UK Prime Minister David Cameron had blamed 
the USA and China for obstructing the discussion pro-
cess when he said that he doubted further international 
agreement on emissions reductions was likely. The 
essence of the problem is that the USA is unwilling to 
accept binding targets while rapidly industrializing coun-
tries do not; China and other majority world countries 
argue that, historically, the industrialized world is respon-
sible for the vast majority of emissions, so they should 
not have to accept emissions reductions yet that would 
hamper their economic growth and ability to reduce 
poverty. However, in November 2014 China and the USA 
announced a joint plan to tackle climate change, involv-
ing a commitment by China to ensure its emissions peak 
by 2030 at the latest, while the USA will reduce its emis-
sions by 26–28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2025.
At COP21 in Paris in 2015 it is intended to create a 
new global climate agreement with binding targets from 
2020 for all parties to the UNFCCC. However, some 
commentators argue that rather than continue to seek 
to agree Kyoto-style targets and pledges, there is an 
increasing need to explore alternatives such as a global 
carbon tax (see, for example, this blog by Dieter Helm, 
Professor of Energy Policy at the University of Oxford: 
http://e360.yale.edu/feature/forget_kyoto_putting_a_
tax_on_carbon_consumption/2590/).
Why has it been so difficult to negotiate a climate 
change treaty, compared to the process that resulted in 
the Montreal Protocol to prevent depletion of the ozone 
layer, often cited as a successful example of interna-
tional policymaking? Key features of the ‘ozone hole’ 
problem were that the scientific evidence of damage was 
relatively clear and simple to understand; it would affect 
rich countries through increased cancer rates, which 
the public was concerned about; ozone depletion was 
caused by relatively few chemicals which were therefore 
fairly easy to regulate; and rich-world industries had 
already started producing non-ozone depleting substi-
tutes so it was in their interests for a treaty to be agreed 
that would speed up adoption of these alternatives. 
In contrast, evidence for climate change causes and 
impacts is extremely complex; most people in the rich 
world see climate change as a problem that will impact 
other people, distant in time and space; climate change 
is caused by GHGs associated with a huge range of 
human activities, affecting many aspects of our everyday 
lives; reducing energy-related GHGs is seen as putting 
a break on economic growth, which is not acceptable to 
the majority world; and many industries regard emissions 
reduction policies as contrary to their interests and so 
have been involved in trying to obscure climate science, 
promote scepticism and inhibit mitigation action.
Q   What will it take for all countries and elites 
everywhere to cast aside their domestic concerns 
and privileges in favour of the global and collective 
good?

146    Section 2  Population, resources, food, the environment and development
simultaneously subvert the process by looking to practise 
more participatory democracy and pushing for funda-
mental change. They did this through the legislation they 
sought, funding environmental groups and organizations, 
and structurally by rotating their representatives sitting in 
parliament, limiting the length of office of their leaders 
and practising participatory decision-making processes.
However, over time ‘the party has been colonized by 
the demands and temptations of parliamentary activity’ 
(Dobson 2001: 127). It has dropped many of its earlier 
commitments (environmental sustainability, disarma-
ment, social justice and participatory democracy) and 
abandoned ‘their experimental attempt at institutional-
izing direct democratic structures within the framework 
of representative democracy’ (Poguntke 1993: 395). 
The radical faction lost out to those in the party who 
believed in reformist change. This led to the party forg-
ing coalitions with other parties, eventually forming an 
alliance with the Social Democrats to form the national 
government in 1998, consequently weakening their 
stance on war and nuclear power, and taking a stance 
against those undertaking environmental direct action 
(Doyle 2005). The German experience is a caution-
ary tale about the difficulties of implementing change 
through formal political arenas.
Environmental NGOs and related groups serve two 
key roles in society: they often identify environmental 
problems and, importantly, they seek to translate envi-
ronmental concern into practical strategies for change. 
In 1971 Friends of the Earth (FoE) was launched in Lon-
don; it has become one of the biggest and most influen-
tial of the British environmental NGOs, and is part of 
an international FoE network. Its formation reflected a 
frustration with the staid conservation movement’s lack 
of action against perpetrators of environmental degrada-
tion (Rawcliffe 1998). They have a five-pronged strategy: 
that we all need to take responsibility for our actions, a 
solely localized approach by some of us will allow the 
harmful environmental consequences of others to go 
unchecked. Multi-scalar action is required, from local 
to international, involving all of us in the processes of 
change. But how have people sought to make such change 
happen and how does it work in practice?
6.5	 Strategies for change
There are a wide variety of ways in which action is taken, 
through international agreements, the legislature (i.e. for-
mal party politics), lifestyle changes, community living, 
and through direct action (Dobson 2001). We can broadly 
conceive of these as a continuum between reformist and 
radical approaches (see Table 6.4). Both approaches are 
part of the broad and diverse environmental movement, 
and many people hold positions somewhere between the 
extreme ends of the continuum. We can use some exam-
ples to explore these strategies in practice: in national 
party politics (the German Green Party), political lobby-
ing (Friends of the Earth UK), direct action (Earth First!), 
individual actions, and business responses.
The German Green Party – Die Grünen – made its 
entrance into formal politics in 1983 with 5.6 per cent 
of the national vote and 27 seats in Federal Parliament 
(Doyle 2005). The party emerged from a vibrant envi-
ronmental movement that was particularly active on anti-
nuclear issues. When it was first launched Die Grünen 
was closely aligned to those seeking radical change. 
Petra Kelly, an early leader of the party, described Die 
Grünen as ‘half party and half local action group – we 
shall go on being an anti-party party’ (Kelly 1984: 21). 
Thus the party aimed to be part of formal politics but

Chapter 6  The environment and environmentalism    147
Such actions have been influenced by many others 
and replicated worldwide. In Australia, environmental-
ists have employed direct action since the late 1970s. 
Tree sits and roadblocks at Terania Creek (New South 
Wales), Daintree (Queensland) and surrounding the 
Franklin Dam (Tasmania) all focused on preventing 
the logging of old-growth trees. India has an even more 
extensive history of satyagraha (non-violent action) 
inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. In the early 1970s, vil-
lagers (mostly women) from Uttar Pradesh physically 
began to try to prevent local logging – resulting in the 
Chipko Andalan movement (McCormick 1989). More 
recently, villagers threatened with losing their land, 
homes and livelihoods by the construction of the Nar-
mada Dam have committed to drowning rather than 
forced resettlement (Shiva 2002).
A key tenet of many environmental approaches is 
the need for individuals to take action. With a grass-
roots movement of individuals making changes, bigger 
changes can occur: ‘the only possible building blocks 
of a Greener future are individuals moving towards a 
to lobby those in political power and industry, often using 
legislative activity to press for change; to generate sci-
entific research and publish it in accessible formats; to 
employ the media to attract attention to particular issues; 
to mobilize the public through local groups; and to coor-
dinate and cooperate with other groups to run large-scale 
campaigns.
By the early 1990s, however, FoE had evolved 
from a radical group to one that seemed less keen to 
press for far-reaching change. In effect it had become 
­reformist – pragmatically seeking inclusion of environ-
mental concern within the current political and social 
system. Many saw this reformist approach as being inef-
fectual, slow and hierarchical, though it has achieved 
some successes, such as influencing the creation and 
passing of the UK Climate Change Act of 2008. Draw-
ing inspiration from other movements and other coun-
tries, smaller, more radical environmental groups (or 
informal networks) began to proliferate. They pose a 
systematic challenge to existing societal practices, often 
rejecting ‘representative’ democracy and formal politics 
and promoting grassroots participation in environmen-
tal decision-making and a ‘do-it-yourself’ approach. The 
tactics employed reflect their belief in the need for radical 
change and often involve the use of non-violent direct 
action such as road blockades and office occupations. 
Direct action is ‘intended to have an immediate effect 
on a situation, as distinct from political activity which 
might have a roundabout effect through representatives, 
or demonstrative activity whose effect was to get public-
ity’ (Rooum 1995: 27).
One such group, Earth First! (EF!), formed in the 
United States in 1979 and spread to the United Kingdom 
in 1991. Based upon anarchist ideology, it is a network 
of autonomous groups that eschew formal membership 
and hierarchy (and thus leadership) and espouse consen-
sus decision-making structures and non-violent direct 
action: one of their slogans is ‘If not you, then who?’ 
(Wall 1999; Doherty 2002). EF! has been influential in 
British anti-roads protests, e.g. Twyford Down (1992), 
Newbury (1995–6) and the A30 in Devon at Allercombe 
and Fairmile (1994–7). They used protest camps with 
tree-sits, tunnels and lock-ons with the aims of (i) physi-
cally preventing road construction; (ii) generating media 
publicity; (iii) educating the public; and (iv) acting as a 
catalyst for mass mobilization. The defining characteris-
tics of such activism are the continuously evolving crea-
tivity in tactics coupled with a broad concern for a variety 
of issues; for example ‘they see exploitation of the Third 
World, the global poor, women, animals and the environ-
ment as a product of hierarchy, patriarchy, anthropocen-
trism, racism and, most prominently, capitalist economic 
relations’ (Seel and Plows 2000: 114).

Reducing fossil fuel consumption 
through personal carbon allowances
Personal Carbon Trading (PCT) has been proposed 
as a means of reducing individuals’ fossil fuel con-
sumption. As a strategy for change, it is a gradualist 
approach that allows people choices in how they 
respond, but proponents argue that it would create the 
necessary conditions for a radical transformation to a 
low- or zero-carbon society. The policy would involve 
allocating every eligible citizen a ‘personal carbon 
allowance’, their free, equal share of a ­country’s per-
mitted carbon emissions, which they would have to 
use when buying certain fossil-fuel related goods. The 
allowances would decrease over many years, in order 
to meet emissions reduction targets.
Every eligible adult would have a ‘carbon account’ 
(and associated ‘carbon card’), similar to a bank 
account, which would be automatically credited with 
their free carbon allowance (composed of ‘carbon 
units’) at regular intervals. Parents might receive an 
extra allowance for children or else higher child benefit 
payments to compensate for the costs of buying extra 
credits to cover their family’s energy use. Fossil fuels for 
home and vehicle use (principally gas, oil, coal, petrol 
and diesel), electricity generated from non-renewable 
sources, and possibly travel tickets would be assigned 
a carbon rating, based on the amount of CO2 emitted 
by using these goods. We would be required to pay in 
carbon units as well as money for these purchases (e.g. 
an electricity bill or tank of petrol). Fuel and travel tickets 
are the only goods that would be carbon-rated; for sim-
plicity, PCT schemes are not designed to cover ‘embed-
ded’ emissions in products such as food and clothes.
Carbon units would be legally tradable between indi-
viduals. Those with spare credits could sell them on a 
regulated market to people who required more than their 
free allocation. This is an important aspect of PCT, since 
the allowance necessary to cover current CO2 emissions 
varies considerably between individuals. It would prevent 
a black market and also provide an incentive for us to cut 
our emissions below the allowance level, which would 
not exist if we could not sell spare credits.
People would be able to check their carbon 
accounts and buy or sell credits at post offices and 
banks, by phone, or using the internet. They would 
also be able to buy carbon units at point-of-sale when 
purchasing carbon-rated fuels and travel tickets, so you 
wouldn’t end up stranded on the petrol station forecourt 
if you suddenly realized you had no credit remaining on 
your carbon card, or had left it at home.
Advocates of PCT argue that it would increase car-
bon literacy and be a fair and effective way to create 
a more sustainable society in which everyone would 
be interested in energy-efficient products, supportive 
of renewable energy, and motivated to change their 
lifestyles. Many details of how PCT would work would 
still need to be clarified before it could ever become a 
reality. The UK Department for Environment, Food and 
Rural Affairs (Defra) conducted a study to assess the 
proposal and concluded that although it would be tech-
nically feasible, PCT is ‘ahead of its time’, particularly 
because of the high costs of implementing it and lack 
of public acceptability (Defra 2008). However, others 
suggest that the costs would be lower and the benefits 
greater than Defra’s calculations, and that Defra’s own 
research shows that PCT is preferred to other policies 
such as a carbon tax (Fawcett 2010).
From 2006, Carbon Rationing Action Groups 
(CRAGs) were formed in the UK and then in a few 
other countries including the USA, Canada and China. 
These were grassroots voluntary groups of people who 
put some of the PCT proposals into practice by setting 
themselves a carbon allowance each year. Some groups 
operated basic trading, with a financial penalty for over-
emitters that was shared out to members who used less 
than the allowance, but most groups didn’t do this and 
instead emphasized supporting each other to cut their 
carbon emissions from home energy use and personal 
transport. People involved in CRAGs showed that it is 
possible to make significant reductions by changing their 
behaviour, installing insulation and renewables (e.g. solar-
powered hot water systems) at home, and buying more 
efficient appliances. An especially popular action was to 
cut down or give up flying, which is very carbon-intensive. 
Being part of a CRAG helped people by offering support 
and a sense of accountability to the group, and encour-
agement, because they could see that their individual 
reductions put together added up to something more 
significant. CRAG members also shared information, 
resources like energy monitors, and social time together.

technologies that reduce environmental impacts (wind 
farms are one example), support ecological projects 
through providing financial services (e.g. Triodos Bank 
and the Ecology Building Society), and practise Corpo-
rate Social Responsibility throughout their operations. 
Globally the United Nations Global Compact attempts 
to encourage such action by asking businesses to sign 
up to ten universally accepted principles in the areas of 
human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. 
However, some companies have lobbied hard against 
legislation that they perceive would impact upon their 
profits. The Global Climate Coalition was formed by 
(mainly USA) companies involved in energy-intensive 
industries such as coal, oil, automobile, electricity 
generation, cement, and paper to cast doubt on cli-
mate change science and campaign against government 
measures to limit GHG emissions (Jeswani et al. 2008). 
Some companies also face accusations of ‘greenwash-
ing’ – appearing green while changing none of their 
fundamental approaches. Spotlight box 6.2 discusses 
one practice that has attracted this kind of criticism. 
Moreover, businesses’ entry into green markets can 
lead to a dilution of the original principles and eventu-
ally subvert the environmental benefits. For example, a 
core element of organic food production is to reduce 
pollution. This principle is enhanced when people pur-
chase organic food locally (for example, through a box 
scheme from a local farm). However, when supermar-
kets saw organics as a market opportunity, they began 
to import organically produced food from Africa and 
Latin America, undermining many of its environmental 
benefits (Hughes 2005, 2007). Here supermarkets failed

others who are doing the same’ (Bunyard and Morgan-
Grenville 1987: 336). Thus individuals are encouraged, 
for example, to ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’. The three R’s 
are deliberately in the order of magnitude of impact. So 
reducing our fossil fuel energy consumption (see Case 
study 6.4) will have a far greater environmental ben-
efit than recycling, which is time, energy and financially 
inefficient. In recent years there has been a rapid rise in 
‘green consumerism’ – purchasing goods such as eco-
friendly washing powder or ‘natural’ shampoos that are 
intended to be less damaging to the environment than 
alternatives. While this is a step in the right direction, 
green consumerism is not about buying less, just pur-
chasing different products. Potentially more sustainable 
ways to meet our needs include swap shops, Freecycle 
and similar online recyling networks (which enable 
people to get unwanted goods for free, thus reducing 
waste and demand for new products), Local Exchange 
Trading Systems and Time Banks (which use alterna-
tive currencies to encourage non-monetary exchanges 
of goods and services), and ‘Buy Nothing Day’ (www 
.buynothingday.co.uk). However, unfortunately at pre-
sent, ‘it seems unlikely that a massive number of indi-
viduals will experience the conversion that will lead to 
the necessary changes in their daily behaviour’ (Dobson 
2001: 131) so it is also necessary to campaign for legisla-
tion to change the infrastructure and social norms that 
create unsustainable ways of living.
Finally, businesses can play a key role in strategies for 
environmental change, both good and bad (Doyle and 
McEachern 2007). Businesses have sought to develop 
Spotlight box 6.2
Carbon offsetting
Carbon offsetting is the practice of buying carbon credits 
from projects which are intended to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions. The credits are then ‘offset’ against the 
purchaser’s carbon footprint. In other words, counted as 
a reduction in their actual carbon emissions. Individu-
als, companies and countries increasingly seek to buy 
carbon credits through funding energy efficiency, refor-
estation or renewable power projects, often in majority 
world countries. In 2005 HSBC, one of the world’s big-
gest banks, asserted that it had gone ‘carbon neutral’ 
by buying carbon offset credits from renewable energy 
projects in New Zealand, Australia, India and Germany.
Critics of carbon offsetting argue that it is a poor 
substitute for actually reducing our carbon emissions 
and is another way that companies and individuals 
can buy their way out of responsibility for the environ-
ment. There is significant debate as to its validity and 
effectiveness, with arguments about measurement 
and ‘additionality’ (i.e. whether projects would have 
happened anyway, in which case the payments for 
carbon credits are not responsible for extra emissions 
reductions). Tree-planting offset schemes have been 
especially criticised because of the time it takes for 
new trees to absorb carbon dioxide, and because they 
only ‘offset’ emissions for as long as the trees don’t 
burn or die and rot. The website www.cheatneutral.com 
explores some of the criticisms of carbon offsetting in 
an amusing way by comparing it to paying others to be 
monogamous or celibate so as to offset cheating on 
your partner.

150    Section 2  Population, resources, food, the environment and development
of progress on poverty and debt in the Third World 
(see Chapter 8 for more discussion on this theme). For 
many in the majority world the links between poverty, 
development and the environment are explicit. It is not 
a simple case of poverty leading to environmental dam-
age: there are countless examples of poor people being 
key actors in environmental campaigns in India, Indone-
sia, the Philippines and across South America. Certain 
forms of development have significant environmental 
consequences – such as dam building, fossil fuel power 
generation and natural resource extraction (see Chapter 5 
for further information). But we should understand these 
developments within the context of a history of colonial 
exploitation and contemporary processes of competitive 
economic globalization.
Ecological modernization has failed to consider 
international justice (Connelly and Smith 2003). Where 
industrialized nations have sought to reduce their envi-
ronmental damage they have in many cases simply 
exported their environmental problems to less indus-
trialized countries: for example, the export of harmful 
to take account of the importance of reducing the ‘air 
miles’ that food has travelled as part of the measure of 
the environmental impact of food consumption.
The dilemma remains how best to enact change, be it 
through NGOs that are able to lever access to the halls 
of power but in doing so can appear elitist, or through 
radical direct action which encourages grassroots partici-
pation and individual responsibility but which in turn can 
be small in scale and effect. For now, the answer appears 
to lie in the vibrancy of environmental movements com-
posed of a variety of contesting, challenging and support-
ive groups, incorporating international NGOs alongside 
more radical small-scale groups.
What can one person, one household, one community 
or one administrative unit do when governments of some 
of the world’s most economically powerful states cannot 
be brought onside? The environmentalist’s answer is to be 
a good global citizen, to put pressure on administrations, 
governments, corporations and supranational organiza-
tions through political and non-political means, and to 
educate, encourage and work with others. We have gone 
some way down this route in the past four decades, but 
significant problems remain.
6.6 What is missing from our  
focus on ‘the environment’?
One of those problems is the way in which we concep-
tualize the environment and ‘environmental issues’ as 
separate from other aspects of our lives and concerns. 
‘Environmentalists’ are stereotyped as ‘treehuggers’ who 
care more about animals than people, and it is assumed 
that they are not the same people as those who campaign 
about human rights and social justice. However, we are 
beginning to acknowledge the complex web of relation-
ships between humans and the environment, and the 
relation of ‘environmental’ problems to poverty, devel-
opment, human health, injustice and issues of democracy. 
In reality, environmental issues are social issues, as shown 
by the increasing focus of development NGOs such as 
Oxfam and Christian Aid on ‘environmental’ concerns 
like climate change.
At the level of international policymaking, too, the 
emphasis has changed since the Rio Earth Summit to 
one that seeks to integrate environment and develop-
ment more closely and for the environmental agenda to 
include concerns about poverty. These lines of thinking 
are underpinned by the World Bank’s Poverty Alleviation 
Strategies and the Millennium Development Goals which 
were agreed by the UN General Assembly in September 
2000 (www.un.org/millenniumgoals) in response to lack

computer wastes to China (Shabi 2002). Environmental 
injustice also occurs within countries (see Spotlight box 
6.3). Furthermore, environmental protection as well as 
environmental damage has resulted in the dispossession 
of Indigenous peoples from their land, to make way for 
national parks for example (see Case study 6.5). This 
practice results from two mistaken beliefs: first, that 
humans will only ever have a detrimental impact on their 
surroundings and second, that preservation of an envi-
ronment is more important than human ties to a particu-
lar place, and in some cases, human survival.
Thus the industrialized world’s approach to ‘the 
environment’ often fails to understand majority world 
experiences, the need to incorporate humans into our 
understandings of the environment, and to acknowledge 
that some people have limited environmental choices. 
Recent work has sought to change how we view the envi-
ronment, suggesting that the division between human 
and non-human is an artificial and unhelpful one (see 
Chapter 12). Environmental concerns have been recast 
as issues of social survival. For example, the impact of 
sea-level rises on Pacific Islanders will be so catastrophic 
that it will potentially wipe out entire nations. People 
who take action on climate change are often motivated 
not so much by concerns about ‘the environment’ for its 
own sake, as by the plight of poor people in the majority 
world who have contributed least to the problem but will 
suffer most (Howell 2013). Rather than being seen as a 
hindrance to wildlife preservation, Indigenous people’s 
environmental knowledge and management skills are 
slowly beginning to be valued. The 2004 Arctic Climate 
Impact Assessment, for example, portrays Indigenous 
people as both at risk of losing their ways of life, and 
as holders of valuable knowledge about the impacts of 
climate change (see www.acia.uaf.edu/). Moreover, Indig-
enous peoples’ often alternative ways of viewing the envi-
ronment, as being a melding of culture, land and sky in 
the case of Indigenous Australians for example, challenge 
our conceptualizations. The need to understand the psy-
chology behind environmental concern and to promote 
behavioural changes are becoming priority areas for envi-
ronmental research (Hulme 2004).
Spotlight box 6.3
Environmental justice
The environmental justice movement calls for acknowl-
edgement that it is often the already marginalized who 
suffer most from environmental degradation. Robert 
Bullard in his book Dumping in Dixie (1990) argued that 
toxic dump sites were more likely to be near neighbour-
hoods of black Americans than whites – race being a 
major factor in the quality of a person’s environment. 
The African National Congress asserted that ‘poverty 
and environmental degradation have been closely 
linked’ in South Africa (McDonald 2004: 2). These are 
forms of environmental injustice.
It is also a critique of environmentalists’ focus on 
wilderness preservation rather than the plight of the 
underprivileged, and ‘has dragged other parts of the 
US environmental movement into a political place 
where the social ramifications of being green have 
to be confronted’ (Doyle and McEachern 2001: 69). 
Understanding environmental problems as rooted in 
inequality is helpful in understanding some of the con-
temporary issues in dealing with climate change. Parks 
and Roberts (2008) argue that ‘global inequality may 
be a central impediment to interstate cooperation on cli-
mate change policy’ (p. 621) and therefore that we need 
to tackle this injustice first.
Case study 6.5 
Wilderness and conservation  
debates in Australia
Environmental campaigns worldwide are often framed 
as conserving ‘wilderness’ and preventing exploitation 
of natural resources. Organizations lobbying for pro-
tection of vast tracts of Alaska, Canada and Australia 
employ an emotive language using words such as 
‘pristine’, ‘untouched’, ‘undisturbed’, ‘intact expanse’ 
and ‘wild frontiers’ to rally support. Photographs of 
lands empty of people or any human structures often 
accompany these words. Whether directly, through 
hunting for example, or indirectly through their develop-
ment activities, people are usually held responsible 
➜

152    Section 2  Population, resources, food, the environment and development
for wildlife losses. Until the 1980s, conservationists’ 
solutions relied on strategies like hunting bans and 
­establishing protected areas through World Heritage 
status or as National Parks.
However, there is increasing recognition not only 
that Indigenous people have historic rights of posses-
sion to some of that land, but also that Indigenous 
environmental knowledge and land management prac-
tices can be beneficial for conservation outcomes. This 
recognition and the legal changes that have accom-
panied it (such as the development of Native Title in 
Australia) have forced environmental and conservation 
groups to reconsider their approach, although many 
have been slow to change their language or practices 
when it comes to viewing areas as ‘wilderness’ devoid 
of people.
Language is a key articulation of power in under-
standings of the ‘environment’. The term ‘wilderness’ 
and its relation ‘wild’ are highly problematic when talk-
ing of any landscape, but especially so in Australia, a 
land inhabited by the Indigenous population for tens of 
thousands of years. Yet these terms are still employed. 
Such a romanticization of the environment draws upon 
the writings of Henry David Thoreau, John Muir and 
Miles Dunphy, and is used to sell Australia and garner 
support for environmental protection.
Indigenous people have been highly critical of 
the use of such words. They have colonial and racist 
connotations, and the narrow vision, propagated by 
environmental groups, of what ‘wilderness’ entails is 
dualistic. Indigenous Australians argue that there can 
be no such division between the environment and cul-
ture and that ‘land is a much more energetic configura-
tion of earth and air, water and minerals, animals and 
plants, as well as people, than a surface area contained 
by lines on a map’ (Whatmore 2002: 71). It is precisely 
because of these interrelations between environment 
and culture that Indigenous people need to live on their 
land in order to care for their country; ‘the land needs 
the people and the people need the land ... these are 
important cultural environments that require people 
to manage them according to tradition and culture, to 
maintain ... and to encourage species’ (Damian Britnell, 
Mossman Gorge Aboriginal Community).
The Indigenous critique of ‘wilderness’ and 
approach to ‘country’, especially calls to live on land, is 
controversial. However, the majority of environmental 
groups in Australia now have (albeit only recently) a 
vague policy of supporting Indigenous rights. Some 
groups have attempted to go further and alter their 
language and practices to implement this policy. The 
Wilderness Society has shifted away from large-scale 
agreements and broad alliances with Indigenous 
groups to grounded community-level cooperation. 
Although they have not discarded the contentious goal 
of creating National Parks, they are working more in 
collaboration with traditional owners, supporting a class 
of National Park which is owned as Aboriginal Land  
but managed under the Nature Conservation Act,  
supporting attempts to gain Aboriginal Freehold 
land, and to establish Indigenous Protected Areas 
­(Schneiders 2006: 27).
The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) has 
taken a different path. They have instigated a northern 
Australia Programme, which aims to take a long-term 
proactive approach towards creating a bicultural organi-
zation. It is focused on coming up with joint goals rather 
than finding campaign partners for issues the ACF think 
are important. To this end they have even opposed the 
creation of new National Parks when traditional owners 
have objected. ACF avoids the words ‘wilderness’ and 
‘biodiversity’ altogether and instead talks about ‘nature’ 
and ‘culture’.
Both these organizations have made progress in 
modifying their language and practices in response to 
the charge that they were party to ‘a form of ecologi-
cal imperialism’ (Langton 1998: 18). However, two key 
problems remain. First, the majority of Indigenous 
engagement by these two groups has been confined to 
northern Australia. A view persists that there is no need 
to engage with Indigenous politics further south, per-
petuating the myth that only those Indigenous people 
who have a more apparent and historic (according to 
non-Indigenous adjudicators) connection to their home-
land need consultation. Second, although the language 
has changed, the underlying premise of why a land-
scape is of enough value to protect has not altered. 
Both still employ a biophysical-based and scientific 
method to determine value. We are a long way from 
bridging the gap between ‘environment’ and ‘culture’ 
and widening the ways in which we value landscape.

6.7 Environmentally sustainable 
futures
Society is taking action: policies are being designed and 
implemented at global, regional and local scales. But 
there are issues that still dog progress:
● The impacts of some environmental problems are dis-
tant in time and space from those who contribute most 
to causing them.
● Remediation and restoration of many types of envi-
ronmental damage takes years.
● The costs of environmental remediation and protect-
ing environments are often enormous.
● Our incomplete knowledge about many aspects of the 
environment, and how environment–society linkages 
work, can act as a barrier to finding effective solutions.
● The drive for economic growth is strong, while 
the negotiation and implementation of global and 
regional environmental policies is slow.
Despite these obstacles it is up to us to decide what 
kind of world we want and to work towards it. We have 
explored a range of ways in which we understand and 
value the environment, different ways in which we could 
‘reconceive the environment’, and strategies for change. 
In summary, there are four key steps we can take towards 
reducing our environmental damage.
First, we need to understand our environmental 
impacts better: globally, regionally, locally and indi-
vidually. At an individual level we can use an ecological 
footprint calculator (e.g. http://footprint.wwf.org.uk) 
to evaluate our resource use. Second, we can participate 
in environmental decision-making. Connelly and Smith 
(2003: 361), through their concept of ecological democ-
ratization, argue that the only way to achieve environ-
mentally sustainable practices is through ‘a commitment 
to both justice and participation’. They advocate exten-
sive citizen participation and development of democratic 
institutions to tackle environmental issues at all scales. In 
many ways this is an extension of many pre-existing local 
initiatives. Third, we need to recognize and make use of 
innovative grassroots solutions. Seyfang and Smith (2007) 
argue that it is the grassroots-community level where sig-
nificant innovation occurs that can offer us inspirational 
visions of alternative futures. We have seen this in the case 
studies about low-impact living and Carbon Rationing 
Action Groups. Some of these innovations are small-scale 
in their approach, others, such as permaculture, are 
now being adopted globally. Fourth, and least ­radically, 
we need to improve our management of the current 
­situation. There are existing environmental issues that 
we need to mitigate immediately, even while we begin to 
explore alternative futures. For example, in Britain there 
are growing numbers of car users. A 2006 government 
report, The Eddington Transport Study, supported road 
pricing, rather than more road building, in order to over-
come existing congestion problems, and argued that ‘all 
transport users should meet all their external economic, 
social and environmental costs’ (Eddington 2006: 2). This 
approach has led to the introduction of the congestion 
charge in London. However, plans to implement similar 
schemes in Manchester and Edinburgh have been publicly 
rejected. We have to decide if road pricing is an appro-
priate management strategy, or whether an alternative 
policy such as having a travel allowance, akin to ration-
ing, would be better. Given these choices, which pathways 
forward are you going to take?

Chapter 7  Food security    157
7.1 Introduction
Food security’ is a term that is used in many different 
ways. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss this con-
cept in a manner that is consistent with its usage at the 
international level by entities such as the UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization. We begin by placing contem-
porary debates about food security into an historical 
perspective.
7.2 Hunger in human history
Widespread hunger has stalked humankind perennially. 
Although this threat might seem far removed from the 
quotidian concerns of most people living in the global 
North during the early twenty-first century, the chal-
lenge to feed and sustain the human population has 
been a pre-eminent social, political and economic strug-
gle across history, and remains central to the planet’s 
circumstances today.
In Western Europe, battles over food and hunger were 
seminal to the cycles of political evolution and revolution 
which forged nation states. Rousseau’s apocryphal descrip-
tion of a French princess (not Marie Antoinette, as com-
monly attributed) asking why the peasants would prefer 
bread to cake [‘Qu’ils mangent de la brioche!’ (‘popularly 
translated as ‘Let them eat cake!’)] is a testament to the 
symbolic and material power of food in political and 
social life. Throughout the period right up until the twen-
tieth century, periodic civil strife over food was a defining 
element of European life. In the British Isles, there was 
ongoing hunger and malnourishment for the working and 
agrarian classes throughout the onset of the industrial 
period, which erupted episodically into food riots, such 
as those affecting England and Wales in 1772–73. During 
the nineteenth century, a key element in the debate over 
the passage of the Corn Laws (which allowed cheaper, 
imported food into Britain) was the need to feed (and, 
thus, politically placate) the fast-growing urban work-
ing class. All the time, however, the threat of widespread 
hunger was ever-present. In Ireland, as is well known, the 
collapse in potato production because of phytophthora 
infestans (potato blight) instigated famine conditions over 
the period 1845–52. Perhaps less well known, similar con-
ditions also afflicted the Scottish Highlands over this same 
period, with a level of death and out-migration which was 
of almost equal magnitude to the Irish famine.
As European peoples spread across the world, these 
challenges travelled with them. The American tradition 
of Thanksgiving traces its origins to the near-starvation 
of the Pilgrim settlers in 1620–21. Following a success-
ful harvest that kept the settlers alive, a Thanksgiving 
feast was held. Comparably, in Australia, the First Fleet 
settlers of 1788 faced imminent starvation within two 
years of arrival due to the expiration of their rations and 
farming failures.
Amongst European peoples worldwide, the politics of 
hunger continued to hold important sway right up until 
the end of the Second World War, often associated with 
interruptions to seasonal harvests brought on by climate or 
war. Thus, in 1815 when the far-distant Tambora volcano 
erupted in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and sent 
a shower of ash into the upper atmosphere, a resultant 
global cooling of temperatures decimated food harvests 
in the northern hemisphere the following summer, creating 
a hunger crisis in cities on America’s Atlantic seaboard. 
The author Simon Winchester describes this event as ‘the 
last great subsistence crisis of the Western world’ (2003: 
295). Food insecurity remained a present threat in urban 
America through the nineteenth century, including New 
York’s ‘bread riots’ in 1837, and food riots in many cities 
during the Civil War (1861–65). In Europe, the wars of the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries were often accompa-
nied by food shortages and hunger. Perhaps the last ever 
full-scale famine in Western Europe occurred in 1944–45 
in the western Netherlands, when Dutch resistance to 
Nazi rule caused disruptions to food transports and an 
estimated 18,000 people died of hunger (van der Zee 
1982). More recently (though perhaps less dramatically), 
the end of the Cold War saw heightened food insecurity in 
the former Soviet Union over several years as its economic 
system restructured to the logics of capitalism. Yet for all 
the importance of hunger within the record of Western 
civilization, non-European populations have been the over-
whelming bearers of hunger across human history. An East 
India Company trader visiting (what is now known as) the 
state of Gujarat in India during the great famine of 1630–
32 recorded that: ‘from Suratt [sic] to this place [Agra] 
our noses were never free of the stinck [sic] of corpses’ 
and ‘the [roads] were so full of dead bodyes [sic] that we 
could hardlie [sic] pass them without treading on or going 
over some’ (cited in Keay 1993: 115). The strengthening of 
British colonial rule in ensuing centuries exacerbated hun-
ger vulnerabilities. Local politico-administrative systems 
were recomposed to fit within colonial logics, which had 
as their core the extraction of profit to service the Empire. 
A series of famines in India during the nineteenth century 
saw the deaths of an estimated 30–40 million people. The 
last major famine under British rule occurred in Bengal, in 
1942–43, when a combination of war-induced decisions to 
restrict the transportation of rice and cyclonic devastation 
resulted in the starvation deaths of between 1.5 million and 
4 million persons (see Case study 7.1).

7.3 The present scale and geography 
of global hunger
Notwithstanding this receding of large-scale repeat fam-
ine cycles, chronic hunger remains at unacceptable levels 
across the world, and almost everywhere, exists side-
by-side with a worsening incidence of overweight and 
obese populations. Many countries are now confronted 
with a double-burden of malnutrition, having to deal 
simultaneously with problems of hunger within some 
segments of their population and overweight/obesity in 
others. However, focusing on undernutrition and hunger, 
a key turning point in this recent history was 2008, when 
there was a confluence of rapidly rising prices for food 
(Figure 7.1) and energy (see Chapter 5). These trends 
sparked a dramatic increase in global hunger. In 2008, 
it was estimated (although see Spotlight box 7.1) that 
the number of people living in chronic undernourish-
ment was estimated to have exceeded one billion peo-
ple. Subsequent revisions to official data suggest that 
the spike in undernourishment was not as severe as 
Histories of China, other parts of Asia and Africa reap 
a similar story. In Ethiopia, for example, widespread crop 
failures and the related onset of hunger occurred with 
regularity once or twice a decade from recorded history 
many centuries ago until 1984–85, when a severe fam-
ine impelled global action. The United Nations defines a 
famine as occurring when three conditions are met: (1) at 
least 20 per cent of the population has fewer than 2,100 
calories of food a day; (2) the prevalence of acute malnu-
trition exceeds 30 per cent of children; and (3) the death 
rate exceeds two deaths per 10,000 people, or four child 
deaths per 10,000 people per day. The arrival of these 
conditions in Ethiopia in 1984–85 provided the impetus 
for a major charitable intervention in the West through 
the ‘Live Aid/Band Aid’ initiative, and brought images of 
famine to many Western eyes for the first time. The eco-
nomic historian Cormac Ó Gráda (2007: 5–6) observes 
that ‘By the 1990s, famine-induced deaths were confined 
to poverty-stricken and often war-torn pockets of the 
globe’. At the time of writing, the most recent episodes 
of famine were in Somalia (2011–12) and West Africa 
(2012). In both cases, war and civil unrest were centrally 
implicated within the onset of famine conditions.
Case study 7.1 
The Bengal famine of 1942–43
Estimates of deaths from the 1942–43 Bengal fam-
ine remain disputed. The Famine Commission set up 
by the British authorities reported 1.5 million deaths. 
Amartya Sen has suggested the death toll was closer 
to 3 million, and some other Indian sources sug-
gest it was higher still. Ó Gráda (2007: 19) adopts 
a ‘mid-range’ estimate of 2.1 million deaths. For the 
Famine Commission estimate, see p. 68 in Weigold, 
A. (1999) Famine management: the Bengal famine 
(1942–44) revisited, South Asia, 22(1), 63–77. For 
Amartya Sen’s discussion of the death toll, see p. 52

Spotlight box 7.1
How many hungry people are there  
in the world?
The FAO estimates that in 2014 there were 791 million 
undernourished people on the planet. In all probability, 
however, this is a lower bound estimate of global hunger. 
The methodology by which these data are collected (via 
national household surveys and modelling the effects of 
changes in incomes and food prices) tends to assume 
that if a household has the capability to acquire enough 
food to meet the daily minimum energy requirements of 
its members, then no-one in that household is hungry. 
But, as is well known, food is not always distributed 
equitably within households (in many societies there is a 
prevalence of men being fed first and women often going 
hungry). Also, just because a household can feed itself 
doesn’t mean it does feed itself; in many households 
across the globe, money that should be used for food 
is used for alcohol, drugs and gambling, for instance. 
Indeed, one of the world’s leading food researchers, Per 
Pinstrup-Andersen, cites an estimate of two billion iron 
deficient people on the planet as evidence to suggest 
that global hunger is far greater than official estimates 
suggest (Pinstrup-Andersen 2009: 6).

persons who are undernourished has fallen since 2008, 
it is still at an unacceptable level, and progress remains 
at the mercy of economic volatility and the limitations 
of our planetary resources.
Furthermore, global hunger is dispersed across the 
world in a highly uneven way, with 40 per cent of the 
world’s undernourished people living in China and India. 
A further four countries (Bangladesh, Pakistan, Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo, and Indonesia) account for 
a further 26 per cent (FAO 2010: 10). Moreover, with the 
exception of China, all of these countries failed to meet 
the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for reducing 
hunger (see Figure 7.2 and Case study 8.1). The MDG for 
originally thought (Pritchard and Choithani 2014) (Fig-
ure 7.1), however increased food prices triggered food 
riots across 60 countries, which saw at least one govern-
ment (in Haiti) fall (Plate 7.1). Significantly, the events 
of 2008 arguably constituted the first-ever global food 
crisis. Because of the highly integrated international 
character of contemporary food commodity markets, 
ripple effects from one country to the next occurred in 
a rapid and coordinated fashion. With hunger a mat-
ter of global political and economic concern, interna-
tional policy makers were shaken from their complacent 
assumptions about the world community ‘winning the 
war’ on undernutrition. Although the global number of

causes and manifestations of hunger. Central to these 
current debates is the newly articulated concept of food 
security. To a large degree, this concept has become the 
foundation stone for contemporary ­strategic interven-
tions of international organizations (such as the FAO) 
and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) (such as 
Oxfam, ActionAid and Red Cross/Red Crescent). In the 
following section, the concept of food security is defined, 
and afterwards, its ­application to key issues relating to 
global hunger is discussed.
7.4 Defining food security
Until the mid-1990s, the prevailing perspective in inter-
national debates on food and hunger tended to prioritize 
production-centric explanations with the emphasis on 
maintaining food stocks in the context of an unpredict-
able world. Hence, in the case of the Irish famine of 
1845–52, cited earlier, famine was seen to be caused by 
the unexpected threat of potato blight. In Ethiopia or the 
Indian subcontinent, famine vulnerability was tied to the 
unpredictability of the monsoon. Clearly, the implicit sug-
gestion within these explanations was that such problems 
hunger aims to reduce by half (between 1990 and 2015) the 
proportion of people in the world suffering from hunger – 
measured statistically as (i) the prevalence of under-weight 
children under 5 years of age, and (ii) the proportion of the 
population below minimum dietary energy consumption. 
Clearly, this map paints a depressing picture of global food 
security; many of the world’s countries with the highest 
rates of food insecurity are also those currently display-
ing worst progress in generating improvements to these 
situations. Moreover, it needs remembering that hunger 
and undernourishment also exist in the developed world. 
The recent global recession has exacerbated the extent  
of hunger: in 2008, 14.6 per cent of the US population  
was food insecure at some point in the year, including 
5.7 per cent with ‘very low food security’, meaning ‘that 
the food intake of one or more household members was 
reduced and their eating patterns were disrupted at times 
during the year because the household lacked money and 
other resources for food’ (Nord et al. 2009: 1). Five years 
later, in 2013, these statistics remained unmoved, despite 
the considerable gains of the US economy since 2008 
(Coleman-Jensen et al. 2013).
The rapid changes in the incidence of global under-
nourishment in recent years have triggered renewed 
debate amongst researchers and policy makers on the

1970s was instigated by the brutal maladministration of the 
militaristic Khmer Rouge. The 1984–85 famine in Ethio-
pia was associated not only with drought, but in a context 
where the national government diverted a massive share of 
scarce national resources to the military. Famine in North 
Korea in 1998 was associated with crop failures in the con-
text of an autocratic regime that prioritized national secu-
rity and protection of the interests of the elite class.
From this analysis, Sen proposed the concept of entitle-
ments as a way of understanding hunger. This concept 
sought to explain hunger and famine by way of asking ques-
tions about the social, cultural and economic frameworks 
that bestowed rights to ownership within populations. As 
Sen contended, even the seemingly straightforward notion 
of possessing a loaf of bread (and thus forestalling one’s 
hunger) assumes a chain of entitlement relations:
I own this loaf of bread. Why is this ownership 
accepted? Because I got it by exchange through paying 
some money I owned. Why is my ownership of that 
money accepted? Because I got it by selling a bamboo 
umbrella owned by me. Why is my ownership of the 
bamboo umbrella accepted? Because I made it with my 
own labour using some bamboo from my land. Why is 
my ownership of the land accepted? Because I inher-
ited it from my father. Why is his ownership of that 
land accepted? And so on. Each link in this chain of 
entitlement relations ‘legitimizes’ one set of ownership 
by reference to another, or to some basic entitlement 
in the form of enjoying the fruits of one’s own labour.
(Sen 1981: 1–2)
Thus, in Sen’s writings on this subject, he asserted that 
the ability of a person to avoid starvation depended on 
her/his entitlements, which, in turn, was constructed from 
her/his ownership bundle (the combination of labour 
powers, resources and assets s/he can use to acquire food) 
and the exchange entitlement regime s/he faced (the rights 
to resources s/he can access to transfer an ownership bun-
dle into food). Or, in slightly more simplified language: 
‘Entitlements are defined as the set of all commodity bun-
dles over which a person can establish command given 
the legal, political, economic and social arrangements of 
the community in which they live (including traditional 
rights such as access to common resources)’ (FAO 2006: 
1). Applying this framework to Ireland in 1845–52, Sen 
contended that famine was caused because the pre-emi-
nent asset within the ownership bundle of the rural Irish 
poor (their control over small plots of land on which to 
grow potatoes, their staple food) became suddenly worth-
less with the onset of potato blight, and the population 
had few other rights over resources that could replace 
this loss (piecemeal social safety net efforts, such as the 
were premised on catastrophic and unavoidable circum-
stances – ‘acts of God’, as an insurance policy might say. 
Hence, in 1974, the World Food Conference defined food 
security as: ‘Availability at all times of adequate world 
food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady 
expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations 
in production and prices’ (cited in FAO 2006: 1).
Fundamental aspects of this perspective remain impor-
tant within present thinking. Rarely, if ever, are rapid 
descents into widespread hunger not associated with a 
food production shock of some kind (climatic, environ-
mental, biological or human-induced, e.g. war). Such 
cataclysms obviously impact on people’s abilities to feed 
themselves and, from a policy perspective, require an 
immediate response in the form of food aid. Nevertheless, 
since the mid-1990s there has been an increasing recogni-
tion of the need to build more sophisticated conceptual 
understandings of what causes hunger. Instead of seeing 
particular biological, climatic or environmental contexts 
as catastrophic events that define these problems, the emer-
gent approach is to understand food production shocks as 
triggers that reverberate (in socially uneven ways) through 
populations. This approach refocuses the attention of 
researchers and policy makers to the broader systems that 
connect people to the food system. This perspective goes 
under the banner of the food security approach.
The chief and most influential proponent of such an 
altered perspective has been Amartya Sen, an Indian econo-
mist and philosopher. Sen was awarded the Nobel Prize 
in Economics in 1998 for a body of work that included 
landmark analyses of the causes of famine. Sen addressed 
the causes of hunger and famine from a radically different 
set of premises from that which prevailed in mainstream 
thinking. He saw that famines in different circumstances 
worldwide each could be understood as having a common 
socio-politico-economic themes. Whereas dominant con-
temporary explanations about these episodes looked to a 
fall in food production as the root causes of hunger, Sen 
documented a more complex reality. Hence in the Irish 
famine, the potato crop failed but Ireland remained a large 
exporter of foodstuffs across to England. In Ethiopia in the 
famine of 1972–73, food was trucked from famine areas to 
the capital of Addis Ababa. The great Bengal famines of 
1942–43 and 1972–73 were associated with ‘moderate’ falls 
in production being translated into severe market shortfalls 
due to hoarding, speculation and ‘administrative chaos’ 
(Sen 1981: 76). Extending this further, Sen’s approach 
asked why some ‘poor years’ of agricultural production 
produced widespread hunger or famine, whilst others did 
not. Clearly, other factors came into play. China’s disas-
trous ‘Great Leap Forward’ of 1957 caused famine not just 
because of crop failures, but also through ill-conceived cen-
tral state planning. Famine in Cambodia during the late 

162    Section 2  Population, resources, food, the environment and development
and social circumstances. Notably, unlike the 1974 World 
Food Conference definition, cited earlier, this does not 
equate ‘food security’ with maximizing food production, 
or having large stocks of food in reserve. These supply-
side factors are obviously important, but the over-riding 
message in this definition is that the attainment of food 
security is primarily about the social, economic, cultural 
and political circumstances that either enable or restrict the 
provisioning of food to needy populations. Thus, the WFS 
definition of food security can be seen as a political enact-
ment of Sen’s notion of entitlements. Ultimately, what is 
important for addressing hunger is not only the ability to 
produce food, but a social-political-economic regime that 
enables people in need to gain that food.
In order to give this definition operational relevance, 
however, it needed elaboration. Accordingly, in the imme-
diate years after the 1996 WFS, an FAO Working Group 
developed a framework for understanding the processes 
that created particular patterns of food security/insecu-
rity. This framework – which is shown diagrammatically 
in Figure 7.3 – conceives food security as being an out-
come from three dimensions of the food system:
● Availability: The supply-side factors that shape the 
availability of sufficient quantities of food of appro-
priate quality.
workhouse system, were associated with poor manage-
ment and/or were hotbeds for infectious diseases (Ó 
Gráda 2007:17)). Hence, although potato blight was the 
trigger, it was this combination of ownership bundles and 
exchange entitlements amongst the poor that provided 
the ultimate cause of the Irish famine.
Sen’s work was an important precedent for the ways 
that policy makers approached these issues at the 1996 
World Food Summit (WFS), in Rome. This Summit is 
popularly credited with launching the concept of food 
security into mainstream food policy discourse. As 
defined at the WFS:
Food security exists when all people, at all times, have 
physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe 
and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and 
food preferences for an active and healthy life.
(FAO 1996)
Expressed in this way, the concept serves a dual pur-
pose. At one level, it encapsulates a normative goal; an 
aspiration for the world community to attain this outcome 
for ‘all people, at all times’. But also, it represents a defini-
tional signpost. The clear focus of the quote above is that 
‘food security’ is defined in terms of the extent to which 
a food system satisfies individuals’ nutritional, livelihood

illustrates this trend. (The international wheat price is a 
good indicator of overall food prices.)
A myriad of factors were behind these production 
gains: more land put to agricultural use, improvements 
in water infrastructure and technologies; developments in 
post-harvest technologies and storage facilities; increased 
capitalization and economies of scale in farming (allow-
ing machinery such as tractors and combine harvesters to 
be employed); innovations in livestock breeding and hus-
bandry; and intensive protein production (fish, poultry and 
pork, in particular). However, two key factors stood out. 
The first was in the early decades of the twentieth century, 
when developments in plant genetics converged with the 
invention of synthetic, nitrogen-based fertilizers to enable 
agribusiness firms to match particular seed varieties with 
specific chemical inputs (see Goodman and Redclift 1991: 
95–100 and Pritchard 1998: 66). These innovations gen-
erated profound boosts to agricultural productivity, espe-
cially in the ‘new world’ agricultural heartlands of the 
USA, Canada, Argentina and Australia. The second key 
shift occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, with the develop-
ment of green revolution varieties of staple cereal crops, 
notably, rice and wheat (see Case study 7.2). Notwith-
standing ongoing controversy about the social and envi-
ronmental impacts of the green revolution, discussed in 
Case study 7.2, with the passage of time its legacy remains 
indisputable. It provided a boost to world food output pre-
cisely at a time when the global population was increasing 
very rapidly, thus forestalling worst-case eventualities of 
potential famine and undernourishment.
● Access: The political, social, cultural and economic 
processes that connect supply-side processes to 
individuals.
● Utilization: The elements of clean water, sanitation 
and health care that ensure that food that is made 
available and is accessible (i.e. the two categories 
above) generates nutritional well-being for consumers.
Reflecting the importance of these three ­dimensions 
within contemporary debates on food security, the 
remainder of this chapter uses this framework as an 
organizing device to bring into focus a series of issues 
relating to food security in the contemporary world. 
We focus on the first two categories – availability and 
access – because the third relates primarily to nutrition 
and ­dietary science and, as such, is somewhat outside the 
scope of the current chapter.
7.5 Food availability
As noted above, the concept of food availability refers 
to the overall capacity of the planet to produce enough 
food to eliminate hunger. (Whether that food gets to the 
hungry, of course, is another matter – to be discussed 
in Section 7.6). By-and-large, the past century has wit-
nessed unparalleled progress in this regard. Increases in 
the quantum of food being produced on the planet dra-
matically exceeded population growth, so that, during 
the twentieth century, food became cheaper. Figure 7.4

164    Section 2  Population, resources, food, the environment and development
Perhaps the harshest criticisms of the contemporary 
global food system, however, relate to its impacts on 
the environment. There is now heightened appreciation 
across the world that food production systems cannot be 
assessed independently from environmental systems –  
a perspective known as the food–water–environment 
Nexus approach. The huge boost to global agricultural 
production in the twentieth century depended on a mas-
sive injection of energy inputs into agriculture, with little 
regard to the ecological limits of natural resources (see 
Spotlight box 6.1). Thus, in the Indian State of Punjab –  
the nation’s breadbasket and a key site for the green 
­revolution – the demands from water-thirsty farming 
systems is seeing the water table fall at an average rate of 
55 cm per year (Aggarwal et al. 2009). This issue shows 
the inevitable connections between food, water and energy 
security. Unless new solutions are proffered, the ability of 
Punjab’s farmers to feed the nation will be seriously com-
promised, and thus India’s poor record on food security 
(see Figure 7.2) will be harmed further. The problem of 
ecological limits is more severe still, however, with regards 
to animal protein. Marine fish stocks appear to be in rapid 
decline, with more than half of the world’s catch coming 
from less than 7 per cent of the oceans, ‘in areas charac-
terized by an increasing amount of habitat damage from

et al. 2009: 23). If the world’s population is to continue to 
Yet in meeting this challenge, new questions have been 
opened about ‘what kind of food system’ the world has 
created. During the last decade, in particular, the ethi-
cal basis of food production (in terms of animal wel-
fare, social issues and environmental sustainability) has 
come under intensified scrutiny. Many have asserted that 
technology has bolstered global food production, but at 
what cost? The intensification of protein production 
systems has been associated with factory farm regimes 
that raise questions about animal rights and welfare. 
Renowned philosophers, such as Peter Singer, contend 
that there has been a moral vacuum at the heart of agen-
das to optimize global food production (see Singer 2009). 
Moreover, the boost to global agricultural production 
has occurred hand-in-hand with increased dependence 
on international food trade (see Fold and Pritchard 
2005), raising questions about the labour standards and 
livelihood conditions that underpin global agriculture 
and food production. These concerns include such mat-
ters as low wages, hazardous working conditions (food 
workers are often exposed to dangerous agro-chemicals, 
especially in the developing world) and the exploitation 
of smallholder producers by commodity traders. Ensu-
ing public debates have given rise to an expansion of fair 
trade initiatives, corporate social responsibility agendas, 
and various types of codes of conduct; however, legiti-
mate questions still remain about the social ethics of the 
global food system.
Case study 7.2 
The green revolution
The start of the ‘green revolution’ is generally traced 
to the plant-breeding research of Norman Borlaug in 
Mexico, commencing in the late 1940s. By the early 
1960s, Borlaug and his colleagues had developed and 
globally distributed a series of high-yield ‘dwarf wheat’ 
varieties with dramatically increased potentials. Also 
around this time, a series of parallel developments in 
rice research (undertaken mainly in the Philippines) 
saw new high-yield varieties developed. These innova-
tions became the centrepieces for major international 
development assistance efforts during the 1960s 
and 1970s. Proponents argued that because of their 
undeniable capacities to boost global cereals produc-
tion, they held the keys to eliminating world hunger. 
Additionally, these agendas enmeshed with the Cold 
War politics of the time – by assisting the rural poor, it 
was argued, Communist sympathies would be muted. 
Thus, as one historian has contended: ‘American plant-
breeding science thus became part of the Cold War’s 
defence of capitalist political economies’ (Perkins 
1997: 239). However, there were (and remain) many 
dissenting voices about the social and environmental 
implications of green revolution interventions. It put 
many rural societies onto a pathway of increasing 
inequality, because richer farmers were best able to 
exploit these technologies and, once they had cap-
tured the benefits, used the returns to buy more land 
(Atkins and Bowler 2001: 221). Ecologically, green 
revolution varieties were associated with increased 
pesticide use (often in poorly regulated contexts – thus 
leading to health and environmental problems), intensi-
fied water extraction and the replacement of multi- for 
mono-cropped agricultural systems, thus reducing 
local agro-biodiversity (see Shiva 1991).

access genetically modified materials). Thus, whilst genetic 
modification may assist farmers to generate higher 
yields and/or enable lower pesticide use, its wider social 
and environmental implications remain an ongoing mat-
ter of contention.
In the early twenty-first century, sub-Saharan Africa is 
the cradle for debate on what role genetic modification 
could and should play in agricultural development. By and 
large, the green revolution of the 1960s and 1970s exerted 
relatively little influence on sub-Saharan African agricul-
ture, because the key hybrid seed varieties were developed 
and trialled in Asia. Thus, in 2006, an agreement to fund 
a coordinated plan to develop a ‘uniquely African’ green 
revolution was established, under the name the Alliance 
for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). The founding 
donors for AGRA were the Rockefeller Foundation and 
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with partnership 
support from a wide range of international development 
and agricultural research organizations. AGRA affirms 
that it has learnt from mistakes of the original green revo-
lution, and professes to implement initiatives that assist 
the interests of smallholders (as opposed to large farms), 
but some NGOs have been critical of its activities (see 
Spotlight box 7.3). At the time of writing, AGRA says it 
‘is not funding the development of new varieties through 
the use of genetic engineering’ (AGRA 2010); however, 
this does not preclude future involvement in these activi-
ties, ‘when it is the most appropriate tool to address an 
important need of small-scale farmers and when it is con-
sistent with government policy’.
eat seafood at its current rate, consumption will need to be 
sourced increasingly from aquaculture. But the rub, here, 
is that aquaculture systems are more resource-intensive 
than marine capture, because they depend on fish being 
fed from manufactured foodstuffs. Hence, it seems that 
the only viable way to sustain the global appetite for sea-
food is to push production into more energy- and resource-
intensive (i.e. unsustainable) ways. Comparable arguments 
can also be made with regards to meat production (see 
Spotlight box 7.2 and Case study 6.4).
So does the continued operation of the current global 
food system imply that to feed the world’s population 
in the twenty-first century, the only option is to further 
degrade the global environment? As the journal Nature 
editorialized in 2010, the challenge of feeding the world 
was easy . . . ‘Easy, that is, if the world brings into play 
swathes of extra land, spreads still more fertilizers and 
pesticides, and further depletes already scarce ground-
water supplies’ (Nature 2010: 531). According to many, 
a key element in resolving the Hobson’s choice of food 
versus the environment is to embrace genetically modi-
fied foods (GMFs). In this chapter we cannot do justice 
to the debate on GMFs, which is complex and multi-fac-
eted. However, in terms of the debate on food security, 
it can briefly be observed that advocacy of genetic modi-
fication needs to tackle the same kind of charges that 
confronted the green revolution; namely, it intensifies the 
high input–high output technological treadmill of farm-
ing, with potentially highly uneven social impacts (richer 
farmers are, in general, better placed than smallholders to 
Spotlight box 7.2
Meat and the environment
Increased consumption of meat is a central feature of 
the current global food system. As populations within 
developing countries become wealthier, their consump-
tion of meat tends to rise dramatically. Researchers 
worldwide agree that the effects on the global environ-
ment of this consumption are overwhelmingly negative: 
‘[T]he livestock sector is by far the single largest anthro-
pogenic user of land. The total area occupied by grazing 
is equivalent to 26 per cent of the ice-free terrestrial sur-
face of the planet. In addition, the total area dedicated to 
feedcrop production [i.e. crops grown to feed animals for 
meat production] amounts to 33 per cent of total arable 
land’ (Steinfeld et al. 2006: xxi). Hence, the expansion 
of grazing lands for meat production (and the additional 
land used for feedcrops that go into meat production) 
is a key factor driving global deforestation and reduced 
biodiversity. Further to these points, the feeding of crops 
to animals for meat production represents a diversion 
of output away from humans. On average, it takes 3 kg 
of grain to produce 1 kg of meat. It is estimated that if 
global per capita meat consumption could be stabilized 
at year 2000 levels, then by the year 2050 an extra 400 
million tonnes of cereal would be available for human 
consumption: ‘enough to cover the annual calorie need 
for 1.2 billion people’ (Nelleman et al. 2009: 26–7). Even 
if it is unlikely that the world will move to a wholly veg-
etarian diet, there are many initiatives to reduce per 
capita meat consumption in different countries, such as 
the ‘meat-free Monday’ campaigns in Western countries.

access. The food security of a household in a coastal vil-
lage of India might depend on fish being caught daily 
by one household member, fruits and vegetables to be 
bought at a local market using the cash income earned 
by another household member, and rice and cooking oil 
being acquired at a public distribution outlet operated as 
part of a government food program.
Comparably, in the developed world, self-sufficient 
production and food disbursement programs play an 
important (indeed, possibly increasing) role for many 
households. Urban agriculture schemes based around 
community gardens and individual allotments have 
grown steadily during the past decade, and media reports 
have suggested that this trend has accelerated since the 
onset of economic recession in 2008 (Plate 7.2). The 
symbolic development of a kitchen garden on the White 
House lawn by first lady Michelle Obama in 2009 tapped 
7.6 Food access
The debates discussed above frame the question of 
whether there is global capacity to feed the world’s popu-
lation. However, for food production to actually reach the 
mouths of the needy requires a further set of considera-
tions to come into view. As the scientific journal Nature 
(2010: 532) acknowledges: ‘Nor are science and technol-
ogy by themselves a panacea for world hunger. Poverty, 
not lack of food production, is the root cause’. This set of 
issues – which invoke the concept of food access – raises 
questions about the entitlement mechanisms that connect 
people with food.
In a general sense, people gain access to food in three 
ways. First, people can grow or procure their own food 
directly, either by cultivating crops, tending livestock or 
by hunting, fishing or foraging. Of course, for most of 
human history this has been the dominant food access 
regime for most people on the planet. Even today, a very 
large proportion of the world’s population relies heavily 
on such mechanisms to ensure their day-to-day survival. 
Second, people can buy food through the use of money. 
(This is akin to Amartya Sen’s example of the umbrella 
seller, quoted above.) Most of the readers of this book, one 
would imagine, obtain the vast majority (if not all) of their 
food through this method. Third, people can gain access to 
food through disbursement programs (such as food banks, 
food aid and food voucher welfare programs) operated by 
governments, international organizations (such as the 
UN’s Food World Program) or charities/NGOs.
These three general mechanisms of food access do not 
operate separately to one another. Households across the 
world have diverse, multi-dimensional modes of food 
Spotlight box 7.3
The Alliance for a Green Revolution in 
Africa (AGRA)
The NGO ActionAid (2009) has published a broad cri-
tique of AGRA. It argues that: (i) too much faith is placed 
on technological solutions, rather than seeking to estab-
lish conducive and stable political, economic and social 
frameworks to underpin these investments; (ii) the pro-
gram’s enthusiasm for private sector-led solutions blinds 
it to the potential for smallholders to become depend-
ent on technologies and seeds owned by large corpo-
rate interests; (iii) ‘large private consulting firms’ have 
played too great a role in project developments, rather 
than African governments; (iv) not enough attention has 
been placed on smallholders’ ‘access to land, water, 
infrastructure, information and credit’ (p. 12). In sum, 
ActionAid advocate a food sovereignty approach, which 
suggests that the best livelihood course for smallholders 
is to extract themselves from the potentially exploitative 
effects of involvement in the global economy. The NGO 
contends that the ‘overall goal [of a restructured AGRA] 
should be to reverse the current dependence on global 
agricultural technological and commodity markets, 
which submerge local knowledge and technologies and 
deepen the extraction of farming surpluses (through the 
unfair pricing of food and inputs)’ (p. 22).

this zeitgeist. Likewise, the recession has also spawned 
increased demand for emergency food disbursements, 
across both sides of the Atlantic. In part, these efforts 
have been entwined also within the ethics of the food 
rescue movement, whereby excess and unused food from 
shops, restaurants and other facilities are acquired and 
redistributed to the needy – thus generating a double-
benefit addressing both the environment and hunger.
Focusing on the developing world (where these issues 
tend to have more pressing livelihood implications), two 
vital debates are pertinent to contemporary discussions 
of how food access arrangements impact on food security 
outcomes. The first relates to the future of small farms; 
whether food security for the rural poor in developing 
countries is ultimately best served by seeking to main-
tain smallholder, self-sufficient production. The second 
relates to national food policies; the extent and character 
of governments’ interventions in food markets to secure 
food security for the poor (a debate about food security 
via disbursements).
7.6.1 Food access via self-production or the market? 
Debate on the future of small farms
The future of small farms in the developing world is cur-
rently a topic of major discussion. In essence, what is at 
stake is the question of what works best for hungry peo-
ple: a food entitlement regime based on people growing 
their own food, or one in which they buy food at local 
markets, shops and supermarkets.
The economist Paul Collier kick-started the most 
recent instalment of this debate with an influential arti-
cle published in the journal Foreign Affairs, in the midst 
of the 2008 food crisis. Collier’s chief charge was that 
‘the world needs more commercial agriculture, not less’ 
(2008: 68), and that ‘[T]he first giant that must be slain 
is the middle- and upper-class love affair with peasant 
agriculture’ (2008: 71). Collier asserted that foreign aid 
projects and ‘rural-friendly’ international financial pro-
grams from the West were inspired by a wrong-headed, 
allegedly ‘romantic’ attachment to support small-scale 
agriculture. In Collier’s vision, food security is best 
attained by encouraging small farmers to abandon their 
plots of land, and then to aggregate those holdings into 
large-scale farms. Former peasants could then work on 
those farms, or move to cities where incomes are gener-
ally higher (see UNDP 2009). In 2009, the World Bank’s 
World Development Report chimed in to support key 
aspects of this argument, arguing that the welfare of the 
world’s hungry and poor would be best served by policies 
that encouraged the movement of people from rural to 
urban areas (a so-called ‘three D’s’ strategy: encouraging 
population density (i.e. population growth in cities), dis-
tance (encouraging people to be mobile, in search of jobs) 
and division (removing barriers like tariffs and some 
restrictions on migration that inhibit the flow of goods 
and people)). The assumption of these visions is that (i) 
large-scale agriculture enables food to be produced at 
lower costs, and (ii) the higher wages paid in cities places 
more money in the pockets of the poor; a tandem process 
that generates quantum improvements in food security.
Yet many researchers question the assumptions that 
lie behind these visions. Encouraging rural smallholders 
to divest their land and move to cities makes sense only if 
countries are at a stage of development where sufficient 
numbers of city-based jobs are available. If this isn’t the 
case, rural migrants add to the ranks of squatter-settle-
ments with highly insecure food and economic prospects. 
A more reasonable approach, according to a number of 
leading geographers (see Wiggins et al. 2010) is to establish 
more gradualist, ‘multi-track’ strategies of rural poverty-
reduction. According to the proponents of these views, 
smallholders’ control over land has foundational impor-
tance in allowing own-production for basic sustenance. 
Hence, food security strategies should aim to bolster the 
livelihoods of the poor through constructing viable rural 
economies, rather than advocating abandonment of rural 
settlements for an uncertain urban life (see Case study 7.3). 
It should also be noted that smallholder-based agriculture 
is generally more climate-friendly, in that it is associated 
with lesser comparative greenhouse gas emissions than 
large-scale intensive agriculture (IAASTD 2009).
Case study 7.3 
Small rural farms and food security
In many parts of the developing world, the majority of 
the food insecure population live in rural areas (FAO 
2005: 5). Many of these people exist on small plots 
of land that are sub-economic (that is, on their own, 
they can’t produce enough food or income to sustain 
a household). Thus, many agricultural smallholders 
in the developing world suffer chronic hunger, despite 
having the ability to grow their food. A good summary 
of the debate about the future of these populations  
can be found in a special issue of the journal 
World Development dedicated to this problem 
­(Wiggins et al. 2010).

7.6.2 Food aid and provisioning programs
In many developing country contexts, food aid and food 
provisioning schemes provide important complements to 
peoples’ access to food via own-production or the market. 
Usually this involves food programs (operated by national 
governments or international agencies, for example the 
World Food Program) warehousing and distributing major 
food staples (rice, wheat, etc.) to populations in need.
Such disbursements are crucial in preventing starva-
tion deaths in times of crisis, but, long-term, have been 
criticized because of the potentially adverse implications 
of creating cycles of food-aid dependency. The crux of 
this criticism is the alleged displacement effects of food 
aid. This arises in contexts where the food security of 
rural populations is dependent upon the sale of agricul-
tural outputs to cities and towns. In such cases, periodic 
large disbursements of food aid can swamp local markets, 
thus driving down prices and taking away the incomes 
of farmers who rely on market sales. Closely related to 
these criticisms is the charge that food aid disbursements 
can often be donor-driven (meaning that they serve the 
interests of the senders, not the recipients). For example, 
the decision by the US government to heavily subsidize its 
agricultural sector has gone hand-in-hand with policies 
to procure large amounts of staple food crops for inter-
national food aid. As many critics have argued, therefore, 
US policies to disburse food aid can be seen as strategies 
that help prop up the incomes of American farmers, as 
much as they are policies aiming to assist hungry popu-
lations. Notwithstanding these criticisms, however, an 
exhaustive study of these issues by the FAO (2006) con-
cluded that the adversities of food-aid dependence tended 
to arise mainly when food aid was poorly managed: ‘On 
balance, the report finds that food aid can support food 
security both in emergencies and in cases of chronic hun-
ger if it is properly managed’ (p. vii).
In many developing countries, international food aid 
plays a secondary role to food provisioning policies oper-
ated by national governments. India is a case in point. 
The national government operates the Food Corpora-
tion of India (which purchases and stores key food items 
from farmers) and the Public Distribution System (which 
distributes food to the poor at highly subsidized prices 
through a nationwide network of ‘Fair Price’ shops). 
In theory, these activities should ensure a basic level of 
nutritional subsistence to the poor. However, well-docu-
mented problems of maladministration and corruption 
have ensured that these arrangements work less than 
perfectly (see Programme Evaluation Organisation 2005; 
Ram et al. 2009). Hence, recent years have witnessed a 
keen public debate in India on how to restructure these 
schemes to ensure that people in need receive their full 
food entitlements. Technological innovations will play a 
key part in future arrangements, with bureaucrats seek-
ing to use smart card and electronic monitoring systems 
to cut down on system ‘leakage’.
Finally, in this regard, is debate over the right to food. 
The above discussion implicitly assumes that the task of 
getting food to people in need relies on the goodwill of the 
international community and/or national governments. 
However, it is increasingly recognized that governments 
have human rights obligations to feed their citizens. In 
1948, the UN Declaration of Human Rights recognized 
peoples’ Right to Food, but this was not clearly incorpo-
rated into any international legal framework until 1996 
(when the Right to Food was adopted by the World Food 
Summit) and then 2000, when the UN Commission on 
Human Rights appointed (for the first time) a Special 
Rapporteur on the Right to Food (a person with over-
arching authority to report on international progress on 
the Right to Food). These initiatives triggered a shift in 
many countries to a rights-based approach to food, that 
is, the recognition by governments in many countries 
that their people had a legal right to be provisioned with 
food, which could be justiciable (that is, heard in court). 
Thus, in India in 2013 the national government enacted 
Food Security legislation that would have the purpose of 
enshrining people’s legal right to food.
7.7 Conclusion
The issue of food security is extensive and complex. This 
chapter has sketched key themes in relation to this con-
cept, but many more have remained outside its purview. 
For example, a crucial area for ongoing consideration is 
the question of how food security and climate change 
connect to one another. During the past few years, there 
has been widespread discussion of these issues using the 
notion of food system stability and the Nexus approach 
(see above) – the extent to which food systems are resilient 
to environmental and social change of various kinds.
The vital message of this chapter is that the food secu-
rity needs to be understood as a social outcome. It exists 
when all people, at all times, have physical, social and eco-
nomic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food. Thus, 
the concept of food security should not be confused with 
debates on the technologies to maximize food production, 
or on whether any country (whether the UK, Japan or 
Botswana) is reliant on food imports. What matters are 
the socio-cultural, political, environmental and economic 
systems that link a food system to a population. To think 
about food security, thus, is to think about the environ-
mental sustainability and social justice of the planet.

Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter, you should understand that:
● Food security is defined socially. It concerns not 
simply the amount of food that is produced, but the 
extent to which a food system is able to satisfy the 
nutritional requirements of everyone in a population. 
Therefore, food security research must focus on the 
three core elements of food access, availability and 
utilization.
● During the past half century, the world has been 
able to successfully address problems of famine, 
but levels of chronic malnutrition remain of major 
concern. Increases to global food prices since 
2007–08 have exacerbated these problems.
● Proposals to increase world food supply through 
technologies such as genetic modification should 
be assessed in terms of how they address the 
needs of the most vulnerable and whose interests 
they serve.
● A key question in the world today is whether the 
long-term food security needs of the planet are 
­better served by a shift to large-scale agriculture, or 
the maintenance of smallholder systems of farm 
production.
● Food security is a human right, and recent 
approaches to this issue have stressed peoples’ 
Right to Food.

D
evelopment is one of the most complex words in the 
English language (Williams 1976) and little consen-
sus exists around the meaning of this heavily contested 
term, yet many nation-states and international organi-
zations claim to be pursuing this objective in some way 
and vast sums of money are spent every year in its name. 
Notoriously hard to define, the term ‘development’ often 
refers simply to ‘good change’, a positive word that in 
everyday parlance is practically synonymous with ‘pro-
gress’ and is typically viewed in terms of increased living 
standards, better health and well-being and other forms 
of common good that are seen to benefit society at large. 
Development also often simply means ‘more’: whatever 
we might have some of today we might or should have 
more of tomorrow (Wallerstein 1994). In many ways the 
strength of development as an idea comes from its power 
to seduce, in every sense of the term: ‘to please, to fasci-
nate, to set dreaming but also to abuse, to turn away from 
the truth, to deceive’ (Rist 1997: 1).
A distinction can usefully be made here between ‘big 
D’ Development and ‘little d’ development (Hart 2001). 
The former refers to a post-Second World War project 
of intervention in the ‘Third World’ whilst the latter 
points to the development of capitalism as a ‘geographi-
cally uneven, profoundly contradictory set of historical 
processes’ (Hart 2001: 650). D/development can thus be 
viewed simultaneously as both a project and a process. In 
other words, development is both a continuous intellec-
tual and ideological project as well as an ongoing mate-
rial process. Historically the pursuit of ‘development’ 
has been focused on particular spaces and regions: most 
frequently on the space of the ‘Third World’, which was 
often seen to be characterized by common features such as 
poverty, famine, environmental disaster and degradation, 
political instability, regional inequalities and so on. A 
particular geography of the ‘Third World’ has thus been 
historically imagined around a powerful and negative set 
of images and a series of tragic stereotypes, along with a 
bewildering array of labels for people and places that are 
seen as ‘deficient’ in some way or that are not considered 
‘developed’ and therefore require external intervention. In 
many ways this is the power of development: ‘the power 
to transform old worlds, the power to imagine new ones’ 
(Crush 1995: 2).
Development agencies often draw upon statistical 
indicators to produce certain stories about the peoples 
and places where they seek to intervene and to narrate 
the lives and geographies of aid recipients, but what con-
stitutes ‘knowledge’ in development policy and practice 
is often defined in relation to quantitative measures, sta-
tistical data, formal academic research and Western ‘sci-
ence’ and this often helps to reproduce the image of an 
underdeveloped, primordial, traditional and war-ravaged 
‘Third World’ (Ahluwalia 2001). In other words, these 
narrations of the disparities between regions are space-
producing practices that help to construct and imagine 
a world in need of development. As Escobar (1995) has 
argued, the idea of a ‘Third World’ gives enormous power 
to Western development institutions to shape popular 
perceptions of Africa, Asia or Latin America. The ‘Third 
World’ is thus partly defined by and becomes intelligible 
through the languages and representations of the agen-
cies and institutions of global development.
In some ways the lack of an agreed set of international 
development indicators and measures or of common sys-
tems of data collection tells its own story of the failure of 
international development since 1945 (see Case study 8.1). 
A major problem with the geographies of development 
produced from these statistics is that they have allowed 
some observers to label whole areas as ‘Third World’ or 
‘lesser developed’ as if the same could be said of all its 
constituents (Wood 1985). In emphasizing what people 
are deprived of (as is implied by poverty), statistics impose 
a negative uniformity upon non-Western societies as poor 
people are categorized and become objects of study or 
are labelled in ways that homogenize them, ignoring the 
complexity of their identities (which are then ‘fixed’ and 
reduced by imposing labels such as ‘poor’ or ‘refugee’). 
Further, labelling whole regions and spaces as ‘developed’, 
‘lesser developed’ or ‘developing’ (all of which are value-
laden expressions) reduces and overlooks the political, 
economic, social and cultural diversity of the places and 
communities included within these gross generalizations, 
simplifications and aggregations.
Thus, the picture of unevenness and injustice in the 
contemporary world that comes to us through these labels 
is not always a sharp, coherent and precise one and often 
this unevenness is not effectively conveyed in the statisti-
cal measures that are taken as indices of what constitutes 
‘development’. Crucial then to the imagination of a world 
requiring development interventions is a process of set-
ting worlds apart and a politics of labelling. All too often 
the ‘developing world’ has been defined as a ‘problem’ 
for Western governments that can only be resolved with 
the intervention of Western ‘experts’, donors, technol-
ogy, expertise or ideology (see Case study 8.2). Moving 
beyond the labelling of ‘Third World’ peoples and places 
as a homogeneous group, it is important to grasp how 
places and peoples are spatially and socially differenti-
ated through development and inequality, experiencing 
progress and ‘good change’ in a variety of ways.
Behind the tragic stereotype of the ‘Third World’ 
there is an alternative geography, one which demon-
strates that the introduction of development has been a 
‘protracted, painstaking and fiercely contested process’ 
(Bell 1994: 175). The chapter also argues that the use of

The Millennium Development Goals
One area where a consensus has been established by 
the international community is around the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). These are eight interna-
tional development goals that all 192 United Nations 
member states and at least 23 international organiza-
tions had agreed to achieve by the year 2015, following 
the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in 2000. 
They included: (1) eradicating extreme poverty and 
hunger; (2) achieving universal primary education; (3) 
promoting gender equality and empowering women; 
(4) reducing child mortality; (5) improving maternal 
health; (6) combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other dis-
eases; (7) ensuring environmental sustainability; and 
(8) developing a global partnership for development. 
Together with these eight goals were 21 targets and a 
series of measurable indicators for each target. There 
is broad agreement that while the MDGs provided a 
focal point for governments on which to hinge their pol-
icies and overseas aid programmes to end poverty and 
improve the lives of poor people – as well as provide a 
rallying point for NGOs to hold them to account – they 
have been criticized for being too narrow. The eight 
MDGs failed to consider the root causes of poverty, 
or gender inequality, or the holistic nature of devel-
opment. No mention was made of human rights or 
energy issues, nor did the MDGs specifically address 
economic development. While the MDGs, in theory, 
applied to all countries, in reality, they were considered 
targets for poor countries to achieve, with finance from 
wealthy states. There was often a perception then 
that the MDGs were rooted in a Northern agenda and 
that countries of the North should thus pay for them 
(in other words that the MDGs were to be achieved 
through aid alone). As the MDG deadline approached, 
around 1 billion people were still living on less than 
US$1.25 a day – the World Bank measure on  
poverty – and more than 800 million people do not have 
enough food to eat. Women are still fighting hard for 
their rights and millions of women still die in childbirth. 
To take these targets beyond 2015 a set of ‘Sustain-
able Development Goals’ (SDGs) have been agreed 
that represent a new universal set of goals, targets 
and indicators that UN member states will be expected 
to use to frame their agendas and policies over the 
next 15 years. In total 17 goals have been agreed 
(and within them are a further 169 targets), although 
it remains unclear how they will be funded. Member 
states agreed the draft of 17 SDGs set at a UN summit 
in September 2015. They became applicable from 
January 2016 and must be met before the deadline 
of 2030. Their success or failure will have immense 
­consequences, not only for the world’s poor, but also 
for the credibility of collective action by the international 
community.
categories (such as ‘developing world’ or ‘Third World’) 
to demarcate world regions on the basis of their levels of 
development is increasingly disputed as these categories 
are beginning to break down and decompose (Sidaway 
2012). This is happening partly as a consequence of the 
recent (re)emergence of a number of ‘rising powers’ in the 
global South such as Brazil, China and India which are 
shifting global economic power towards the South and 
unsettling the boundaries used to differentiate rich and 
poor, ‘First’ and ‘Third’ World, ‘developed’ and ‘develop-
ing’ countries.
The first section of the chapter examines the ori-
gins of the ‘three worlds’ schema during the Cold War 
and the emergence of a space called the ‘Third World’ 
that became a focal point for the ideological struggle 
between capitalism and communism, between the USA 
and the USSR and their different forms of aid and ‘devel-
opment’. The next section then discusses two of the 
most important conceptual perspectives that have been 
formulated on the relations between development and 
inequality: the modernization and dependency schools. 
Although there have been many other different strands of 
development thinking, both these perspectives have been 
widely influential and remain relevant to an understand-
ing of theory and practice today. The next section then 
outlines the need to view development historically and to 
formulate a sense of how it has been redefined through 
time. How have historical forces shaped our understand-
ing of the geography of development and in what ways 
are the legacies of the past important to understanding 
contemporary global economic difference and inequal-
ity? The penultimate section of the chapter then looks at 
the ‘rising powers’ and examines the emergence of new 
Southern donors, exploring the implications of their rise 
for contemporary geographies of development. The con-
cluding section returns to the key themes of unevenness

global economic downturn in 2007 has had implications 
for the livelihoods of almost everyone in an increasingly 
interconnected world and there has been evidence of ris-
ing levels of unemployment, poverty and homelessness 
in many supposedly ‘advanced’ and ‘developed’ Western 
economies.
‘Development’ has historically served in part as a kind 
of ‘lighthouse’ (Sachs 1992) or as a ‘lodestar’ (Wallerstein 
1991) into which several different movements, govern-
ments and institutions have invested faith and meaning. 
The period 1955–75 was one of extraordinary global 
change and of confrontational political realignment 
as a result of the global ideological struggle between 
capitalism and communism (the Cold War), but it was 
also a period that saw an intensification of debates con-
cerning the development of the ‘Third World’ and the 
beginning of collective political demands in the fields 
of ‘development’ and politics (see Case study 8.2). With 
the accelerating pace of decolonization and the creation 
of independent states in the South, geopolitical ques-
tions begun to be addressed from a set of new or ‘Third 
World’ perspectives and there was a growing perception 
that ‘underdeveloped’ countries had distinct geopolitical 
considerations from those of Western societies (see also 
Chapter 20).
The ‘three worlds’ schema is very much a Cold War 
conceptualization of space and is strongly associated 
with the global social and political conflict between cap-
italism and communism, between the USA and USSR, 
in the second half of the twentieth century. During this 
time both these superpowers used the giving of foreign 
aid as a way to promote their own wider political and 
strategic objectives and to promote their own particular 
ideological visions of the ‘correct’ pathways to develop-
ment (capitalist or communist) (see Case study 8.2). For 
the USA, on the one hand, the idea of development was 
seen as the way to counter the spread of communism and 
of ‘making the world safe for capitalism’ (Westad 2006: 
31) since the donation of foreign aid was often linked to a 
recipients acceptance of market access and the exclusion 
of communists and left-wing socialists from government. 
The USSR, on the other hand, saw foreign aid as a way 
of ‘exporting’ communist revolution to the periphery, 
of building a sphere of influence and creating a block 
in opposition to the West (Berzoets 2011). Both the USA 
and USSR identified vital national interests in ‘Third 
World’ territories and for both Washington and Moscow 
‘developing areas appeared critical to the achievement of 
basic strategic, economic, political and ideological goals’ 
(McMahon 2001: 2). In both cases foreign aid was thus 
used to secure alignment between the politics of emer-
gent ‘Third World’ countries and the wider geopoliti-
cal strategies of the USA and USSR (see Case study 8.3) 
and inequality and challenges the notion that ‘develop-
ment’ is just an issue for the global South.
8.1 Development and the geography  
of the ‘Third World’
Definitions of the term ‘Third World’ have been con-
tested, as have the origins of the phrase (Mountjoy 1976; 
O’Connor 1976; Auty 1979; Pletsch 1981; Wolfe-Phillips 
1987), yet the concept of ‘three worlds’ can hardly be 
said to convey a precise meaning or to be characterized 
by a specific geography with clear boundaries. The three 
worlds schema posited a ‘First World’ of advanced capi-
talism in Europe, the USA, Australia and Japan, a ‘Second 
World’ of the socialist bloc (China’s position within this 
has been much debated) and a ‘Third World’ made up of 
the countries that remained when the supposedly ‘signifi-
cant’ spaces of the world had been accounted for. These 
terms thus have to be approached with some caution. For 
some observers the terms global ‘North’ and ‘South’ are 
preferable to the ‘three worlds’ scheme but again there 
have been problems with defining where the boundaries 
of this global divide can be drawn.
Following the fall of the Eastern Bloc (or Second 
World), many of its constituent countries were reclas-
sified as ‘developing’, despite being geographically 
located in the ‘North’. At the same time, geographically 
‘southern’ nations previously considered to be part of 
the ‘Third World’ such as China, Brazil, India and South 
Africa, have experienced levels of economic growth that 
appear to bring them closer to the ‘First World’. Further-
more, the lines that have so far divided North and South 
are now present within every nation-state and are mak-
ing ever less appropriate the conventional language used 
to interpret the geography of development in the world 
economy (rich/poor, North/South, First World/Third 
World, developed/developing) (Power 2003).
Subscribers to the three worlds scheme have been criti-
cized for the simplicity of these divisions and their failure 
to recognize diversity and difference within these spaces; 
the world does not consist of a series of discrete individ-
ual national or regional economies in the way often sug-
gested in United Nations and World Bank reports and in 
the context of globalization it is important to attend the 
interdependencies that link and connect different places, 
peoples, nations and regions. We also need to remember 
that the pursuit of development is not exclusive to par-
ticular regions (such as the so-called ‘Third World’) and 
that issues of poverty and inequality are also highly per-
tinent in both the ‘First World’ and in the former socialist 
states that comprised the ‘Second world’. The onset of a

the proletariat and of the first proletarian state, the Soviet 
Union. Their struggle for independence from the imperi-
alist West would contribute to the weakening of the major 
opponents of the Soviet Union, including ultimately the 
United States. In the early stages of Soviet involvement in 
the ‘Third World’ the model that clients were expected to 
underlining the importance of geopolitics to both the 
theory and practice of development.
In 1949, US President Harry Truman spoke of the emer-
gence of an ‘underdeveloped’ world that presented a ‘handi-
cap and threat both to them and the more prosperous areas’ 
(Truman 1949). Truman went on to explain the need for 
‘modern, scientific and technical knowledge’ as a pathway 
to overcoming this ‘handicap’ of underdevelopment and 
announced the beginning of a ‘bold new program’ within 
the ‘developed world’ to resolve inequality and remedy 
impoverishment in ‘backward’ areas. This agenda was fur-
ther advanced under the administration of President John 
F. Kennedy (1961–3) that oversaw the creation of the United 
States Agency for International Development (USAID) in 
1961. In the same year Kennedy also proposed an ‘Alliance 
for Progress’, a 10-year US$20 billion programme that con-
siderably increased economic and development cooperation 
between the US and Latin America as a way of stopping the 
spread of communism in its tracks.
The Soviet Union also sought influence through aid 
after the Second World War. Initially it offered modest 
amounts of subsidized oil and technical assistance along 
with weaponry and military training before moving to 
a much more extensive involvement in regional conflicts 
through the supply of military capabilities and the use 
of proxies, such as Cuba. After Eastern Europe, the 
Soviet Union progressively drew in Cuba, Vietnam, Laos 
and several African states (such as Angola, Ethiopia and 
Mozambique), drawing upon Lenin’s argument that the 
peoples of the colonial world represented de facto allies of

Bandung, non-alignment and the 
‘Third World’
The Bandung conference was a meeting of repre-
sentatives from 29 African and Asian nations, held in 
Bandung (Indonesia) in 1955, which aimed to promote 
economic and political cooperation within the ‘Third 
World’ and to oppose colonialism. The conference 
was sponsored by Burma, India, Indonesia, Ceylon 
(Sri Lanka) and Pakistan and tried to cut through the 
layers of social, political and economic difference that 
separated nations of the ‘Third World’ in order to think 
about the possibility of common agendas and actions. 
The aims of the 29 nations that attended included a 
desire to promote goodwill and cooperation among 
Third World nations and to explore and advance 
their mutual as well as common interests. Bandung 
was in many ways the ‘launching pad for Third World 
demands’ where countries distanced themselves from 
the ‘big powers seeking to lay down the law’ (Rist 
1997: 86). It was not hard for countries with shared 
histories of colonial exploitation to find something in 
common, since the ‘agenda and subject matter had 
been written for centuries in the blood and bones of 
participants’ (Wright 1995: 14). In his opening speech 
to the conference on 18 April 1955, President Sukarno 
of Indonesia urged participants to remember that they 
were all united by a common ‘detestation’ of colonial-
ism and racism (Sukarno 1955: 1) and pointed out that 
colonialism was not dead or in the past but also had 
its modern (‘neo-colonial’) forms. The conference was 
especially successful in hastening the arrival of new 
international institutions explicitly dealing with ‘devel-
opment’ (Rist 1997).

technical assistance and the education and training of 
local people to build the foundations of modern indus-
trial and agricultural enterprises. Soviet aid almost always 
went for large and visible projects in the state sector that 
were expected to increase the productive capacities of 
the recipient country and reduce their dependence on the 
capitalist West. Over time, however, military support gen-
erally outweighed economic assistance in Soviet policy.
follow was that of the Soviet Union itself with its focus 
on state control of the ‘heights’ of the economy, heavy 
industrial projects, import substitution, reduction of 
ties with the capitalist West, and closer integration with 
socialist states (Valkenier 1983). An important aspect of 
Soviet policy toward countries across Asia, Africa and 
Latin America was the provision of equipment for infra-
structure and industrial development projects as well as 
Case study 8.3 
The ‘strategic interests’ of foreign aid
In many ways, examining the case for aid can tell us 
a great deal about the history of development theory 
and practice and provides a useful opening on to 
wider discussions of North–South relations. Most 
­official development assistance (ODA) comes from the 
OECD’s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) 
whose 28 members collectively contributed  
US$134.8 billion in 2013 (OECD 2014a) representing 
0.30 per cent of DAC donors’ combined gross national 
income. A further US$15.9 billion in ODA came from 
the European Commission in 2013 whilst non-DAC 
countries gave an additional US$9.4 billion. Only five 
members of the DACs 28 member countries, however, 
have met a long-standing UN target for ODA to com-
prise at least 0.7 per cent of a donor’s gross national 
income (GNI) (Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden 
and the UK). DAC aid to developing countries grew 
steadily from 1997 to a peak in 2010, but then fell in 
2011 and 2012 as many governments took austerity 
measures and consequently sought to trim their aid 
budgets. Around two-thirds of DAC aid is government-
to-government or bilateral aid and the remainder is 
multilateral aid disbursed by agencies like the World 
Bank group, the UN bodies and the European Union. 
Critics of foreign aid have argued that it has been 
less effective than private investments and commer-
cial loans in stimulating long-term economic growth. 
Other critics point to the dubious Cold War record of 
foreign aid and its subsidizing of autocratic regimes 
and inflammation of regional conflicts. Foreign aid has 
sometimes been seen as a kind of political narcotic, 
fostering addictive behaviour among states that receive 
it and thus come to depend on it. States are thought 
to exhibit the symptoms of ­dependence – ­a short-run 
‘fix’ or benefit from aid, but external ­support some-
times does lasting damage to the country. For Moyo 
(2009) limitless development assistance to African 
governments has fostered dependency, encouraged 
corruption and ultimately perpetuated poor governance 
and poverty. Thus, many critics of foreign aid have 
sought to highlight the ‘strategic interests’ at work in 
its distribution as well as the inequality and unpredict-
ability of aid provision. During the ‘War on Terror’, for 
example, there is evidence that the USA used foreign 
aid donation to secure support from a number of states 
in the South such as Pakistan. Just as ‘development’ 
was once seen as a means of countering the spread 
of communism in the 1950s, shortly after 9/11 it was 
increasingly re-constructed as a means of countering 
terrorism. Strangely, except for a brief period during the 
mid-1970s, anti-poverty measures have not been an 
important focal point of foreign aid, whilst aid has led 
to many reversals as well as to advances. Seen as a 
(simultaneous) remedy to problems of growth, govern-
ance, poverty and inequality, it has become (not unlike 
the idea of development) overburdened with expecta-
tions (Sogge 2002) and an overambitious enterprise 
(Rist 1997). A report by ActionAid claimed that only 
39 per cent of total overseas development assistance is 
‘real aid’ and that the remainder is ‘phantom aid’, made 
up of overpriced technical assistance, double-counted 
debt relief and poorly targeted and uncoordinated aid 
(ActionAid International 2005). Although aid from OECD 
donors has increased in recent years, much of this is in 
the form of debt relief, or humanitarian or military aid, 
which does little to advance long-term development.
Not surprisingly (given the size of its economy) the 
United States remained the largest DAC donor in 2013 
by volume with net ODA flows of US$31.5 billion, yet 
this constitutes only 0.19 per cent of US gross national 
income. Countries like Afghanistan and Iraq (in the 
reconstruction of which the USA has been heavily 
involved in recent years) have figured prominently in 
the list of major DAC aid recipients, yet interestingly so 
too have emerging economies like India which is itself 
increasingly active as an aid donor.

8.2 Conceptualizing development
When considering the many ways in which ­development 
has been conceptualized it is useful to consider the his-
tory of ‘Development thinking’ (Hettne 1995), or the 
sum total of ideas about development theory, ideology 
and strategy. Development theories are logical proposi-
tions about how development occurred in the past and/
or should occur in the future. Development ­strategies 
are the practical paths to development adopted by a 
wide range of actors, from the ‘grassroots’ to the inter-
national. Development ideologies are the different goals 
and objectives that underpin development theories and 
strategies. In many ways this ‘development thinking’ has 
often been caught in a ‘Western’ perception of reality or 
has been based around ‘Western’ philosophies, experi-
ences and histories (Hettne 1995; Power 2003). Concep-
tualizing development is partly about the negotiation 
of what constitutes ‘progress’ and ‘improvement’ and 
the definition of what constitutes ‘appropriate’ inter-
vention in the affairs of ‘poor’ or ‘lesser developed’ 
countries. Since all-encompassing definitions have 
been contested and controversial, little consensus exists 
today but some core conceptions have emerged, many 
of which have continued relevance in the contemporary 
world. Although there are many different strands of 
development thinking to explore, the modernization 
and dependency approaches have been two of the most 
influential in the twentieth century. Both approaches 
were far from being static, uniform or unified, however, 
and neither represents a singular commonly agreed 
approach. In discussing these different conceptions 
then it is important to think about where and when 
they emerged. Most reflect some of the priorities of 
development thinking characteristic of their era. The 
formation of development theories, therefore, depends 
on different perceptions of ‘development challenges’ at 
different times.
8.2.1 The modernization school:  
an anti-communist manifesto
With the end of the Second World War and after the 
United Nations was established, conceptualizations of 
development received a decisive stimulus. Between 1945 
and 1981, UN membership rose from 51 to 156 nation-
states (Berger 2001). With many new states being formed 
after the end of colonialism and in the context of the 
Cold War, theorizing development became a more com-
plicated and contested enterprise. In some ways the task 
of development was seen by some as seeking to provide 
China also used aid and development cooperation to 
further its socialist agenda and to compete with Soviet 
and US influence in regions like Africa, constructing itself 
as part of the ‘Third World’ and at the head of a united 
international proletariat battling against imperialism. 
Chinese leaders believed that by fomenting revolution 
in the various ‘rural’ areas of the world, eventually the 
liberation movements would surround and overrun the 
urban areas, just as they had in China during its civil 
war. Between 1967 and 1976 China’s aid had reached an 
average of 5 per cent of government expenditure and at 
the start of the 1970s Chinese teams were building close 
to 100 different turn-key aid projects around the world 
(Brautigam 2009: 41). By 1978 some 74 countries were 
receiving aid from China, the largest group of which 
were in Africa, and by then China had aid programs in 
more African countries than the USA. The Chinese often 
made a point of supporting schemes that the West had 
rejected on narrowly economic grounds or which were 
important to African states for political or psychological 
reasons, and they also made a point of ‘doing something’ 
for districts that the Europeans had been content to leave 
as backwaters (Snow 1988). Aid was also an important 
geopolitical tool for the Chinese in the contest with Tai-
wan (also an aid giver) and the USSR (where the Chinese 
aimed to shame the Kremlin by stepping up their charity 
and economic aid and by providing fewer arms). Aid thus 
became an important way of exposing the limitations of 
China’s opponents, both Western and Soviet.

of capitalist development from urban-industrial areas to 
other regions (Stöhr and Taylor 1981) as Rostow (1960) 
predicted that nations would ‘take off’ into development, 
having gone through five stages, which he likened to the 
stages an aeroplane goes through before take-off, from 
taxiing on the runway to mid-flight. Ranging from stage 
one, ‘traditional society’, to stage five, the ‘age of high 
mass consumption’, the theory takes our faith in the 
capitalist system for granted since Rostow assumed that 
all countries will be in a position to ‘take off’ into devel-
opment. Further, in common with other modernization 
approaches, Rostow’s model devalues and misinterprets 
‘traditional societies’, which represent the ‘lowest’ form  
or stage of development. The advanced state of mod-
ernization was always represented as ‘Western mod-
ernization’; traditional societies seem like distant, poor 
relations.
In America the Democratic administrations of the 
1960s took Rostow’s theory to mean that if the USA 
could help shepherd ‘underdeveloped’ countries safely 
through the take-off stage then the Communist ‘con-
tagion’ could be arrested. Many social scientists like 
Rostow thus turned modernization theory’s description 
of the modernity of Western societies into a prescrip-
tion for transforming the Third World. It is important 
to remember, however, that theories of modernization 
were not an exclusively American enterprise – moderni-
zation was also a very influential idea within the Soviet 
Union. In part then the conflict between East and West 
in the Third World was an expression of two competing 
models of modernization, a democratic one led by the 
USA and a socialist one led by the USSR (Westad 2006). 
Geographies of inequality and development cannot be 
‘an ethos and system of values which can compete suc-
cessfully with the attraction exercised by Communism’ 
(Watnick 1952–3: 37). In this regard many observers 
called for the modernization of ‘underdeveloped areas’ 
and painted a picture (following President Truman) of 
‘underdeveloped peoples’ confined to ‘backwardness’ but 
torn between the appeal of communism and the prospect 
of Western modernization. This was an essential char-
acteristic of the modernization school, which was often 
dualistic, opposing ‘traditional’ to ‘modern’ life-styles, 
‘indigenous’ to ‘Westernized’, as if no country or citizen 
could belong to both categories.
Albert Hirschmann (1958) was a key proponent of 
modernization ideas, voicing the optimistic view that 
the forces of concentration (‘polarization’) will ‘trickle 
down’ from the core to the periphery at national, regional 
and global scales. Hirschmann explained how develop-
ment economics might ‘slay the dragon of backwardness’ 
(quoted in Rist 1997: 219). John Friedmann’s (1966) core–
periphery model adopts many of the same assumptions 
about the polarization of development in ‘transitional 
societies’ and the ‘trickle-down’ effect of development. 
Geographers at the time sought to contribute to the map-
ping of modernization geography, seeking to look at how 
progress trickled down along urban hierarchies, through 
transport systems or with the introduction of modern 
technology. The message from these modernization geog-
raphies was that underdeveloped countries could move 
briskly into the modern tempo of life within a few years, 
whilst the state (concerned with macro issues and the 
national economy) would be the key monitor and broker 
of development.
One of the modernization theorists who identified 
‘stages of growth’ in the development process was the 
American economic historian and political theorist Walt 
Whitman Rostow. Subtitling his book A Non-Commu-
nist Manifesto, Rostow (1960) played a key role in the 
administrations of both John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. 
Johnson in the 1960s and closely shaped US foreign policy 
in South-east Asia during this time. For Rostow Com-
munism was ‘an opportunistic virus that took out infant 
nations not yet blessed with a constitutional “maturity”’ 
(Gilman 2003: 195) and he was the first to advise Presi-
dent Kennedy to send US combat troops to South Viet-
nam in 1965 and the first to recommend the bombing of 
North Vietnam in 1966. To Rostow, communism was not 
the agent of modernization but a side effect of it. It was a 
‘disease of the transitional process’ likely to spread in any 
nation during the early, difficult stages of development 
and instead of accelerating growth communism ‘dis-
figured’ it, producing an unbalanced and dysfunctional 
modernity. Again the focus was on a top-down ‘trickling’

8.2.2 The dependency school:  
beyond ‘core’ and ‘periphery’?
One of the major weaknesses of the modernization 
approach was that the notion of a ‘trickle-down’ dif-
fusion of development implied that there were precise 
demarcations available of where the ‘core’ ends and the 
‘periphery’ begins when this has never really been the 
case. Radical dependency approaches that emerged in 
the 1960s and 1970s challenged this notion of positive 
core–periphery relations, identifying instead exploita-
tion between ‘satellites’ and ‘metropoles’. Whilst the 
modernization approach was taken up by many inter-
national institutions and bilateral donors, dependency 
approaches comprised all those opposed to US post-war 
imperialism and allied in some way to the movement of 
‘third worldism’. The dependency school is most com-
monly associated with Latin America, but also emerged 
in Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East. Drawing 
upon Marx’s writings about the unevenness of capitalist 
development, dependency scholars such as Celso Fur-
tado (1964) and Milton Santos (1974) drew attention 
to the mode of incorporation of each country into the 
world capitalist system, identifying this as a key cause 
of exploitation.
The dependency school is most commonly asso-
ciated with the work of André Gunder Frank who 
published a number of seminal pieces on ‘The devel-
opment of underdevelopment’ in the late 1960s (Frank 
1966). This thesis is relatively uncomplicated in that it 
views development and underdevelopment as opposite 
sides of the same coin; the development of one area 
often necessitates the underdevelopment of another. 
For the dependency scholars (or dependentistas), a big 
part of the economic development and wealth of the 
rich countries is wealth that has been directly imported 
from the poor countries as the world economic system 
actively generates inequality. Dependency on a metro-
politan ‘core’ (e.g. Europe, North America) increases 
the ‘underdevelopment’ of satellites in the ‘periphery’ 
(e.g. Latin America, Africa). Unlike many moderni-
zation approaches, the dependentistas sought to view 
development in historical context, and argued, for 
example, that colonialism helped to put in place a set 
of dependent relations between core and periphery. 
These peripheral satellites, they argued, were encour-
aged to produce what they did not consume (e.g. 
primary products, including natural resources) and 
consume what they did not produce (e.g. manufac-
tured or industrial goods). Thus, rather than likening 
the process of economic growth to an aeroplane setting 
off into a blue sky of urban-based, Western life-styles 
and consumption, the dependency school was arguing 
neatly summarized as a set of prescriptive stages how-
ever. Urban areas, for example, are themselves subject 
to uneven development and inequality (see ­Chapter 10). 
Modernization approaches have also largely failed to 
address the importance of gender, assuming that men 
and women occupied equal positions in terms of power 
relations and decision-making. Further, the ‘trickle-
down’ effect has often failed to materialize among 
those who have been the subjects of modernization 
projects. This approach seemed to suggest that devel-
opment could be mimicked, copied and replicated and 
that ‘underdeveloped’ countries should try to reproduce 
the development paths of richer ‘developed’ nations like 
Britain or the USA. As Gunder Frank has argued, this 
approach can also be understood as reflections of the 
‘Sinatra Doctrine’:
Do it my way, what is good for General Motors is good 
for the country, and what is good for the United States 
is good for the world, and especially for those who 
wish to ‘develop like we did’.
(Frank 1997: 13)
In the modernization schema, it was implied that 
there is nothing before the beginning of development 
in a ‘developing country’ that is worth retaining or 
recalling, only a series of deficiencies, absences, weak-
nesses and incapacities (Abrahamsen 2000; Andreas-
son 2005). The approach was also in a sense very much 
based around a ‘top–down’ rather than a ‘bottom–up’ 
approach, implying that the process could be brokered 
by states or development institutions rather than emerge 
from the ‘grass-roots’ struggles of ‘Third World peoples’ 
as had been called for in some more radical approaches. 
In terms of common criticisms, the division of the 
world into modern and traditional has often been seen 
as problematic (Pletsch 1981). Modern societies were 
much more fractured and were divided by ethnicity, 
class and politics and were not as united and respon-
sive to the blueprints of planners as was often assumed. 
The scale of modernization programmes was also often 
a problem in that they assumed that ‘big is beautiful’ 
(involving large dam-building and irrigation projects, 
for example). Rostow was also able to say little about the 
‘final stage’ of his organic model of development since 
his underlying principle was that growth had no limits 
(Rist 1997) and instead he simply discussed a number of 
very generalized scenarios. Like so many theorizations 
of development that followed, it ended with a creed, a 
set of principles about what was to be done, and heav-
ily invested faith in the goals of mass consumption and 
Westernization.

Chapter 8  Worlds apart? The changing geographies of global development      179
1949, but the idea of development is much older than this 
(Cowen and Shenton 1996) and has much more diverse 
geographical origins. Development was not a simple ‘gift’ 
following contact with Europeans but predates the ‘age 
of discovery’ (1400–1550) and the ‘age of empire’ (1875–
1914) (see Section 1 of this book). It is, however, particu-
larly important to examine the significance of Empire in 
the making of international development. Between 1800 
and 1878, European rule, including former colonies in 
North and South America, increased from 35 per cent to 
67 per cent of the earth’s land surface, adding another 
18 per cent between 1875 and 1914, the period of ‘for-
mal colonialism’ (Hoogevelt 1997: 18). In the last three 
decades of the nineteenth century, European states thus 
added 10 million square miles of territory and 150 mil-
lion people to their areas of control or ‘one fifth of the 
earth’s land surface and one tenth of its people’ (Peet 
with Hartwick 1999: 105).
Colonialism has been variously interpreted as an eco-
nomic process of unequal exchange, as a political process 
aimed at administration and subordination of indigenous 
peoples, and as a cultural process of imposing European 
superiority (see Chapters 2 and 20). According to the 
dependency theorists it was in this period that the periph-
ery was brought into an expanding network of economic 
exchanges with the core of the world system. A new sense 
of responsibility for distant human suffering also first 
emerged during this time as the societies of Europe and 
North America became entwined within global networks 
of exchange and exploitation in the late eighteenth and 
early nineteenth centuries (Haskell 1985a, 1985b). Thus 
the origins of a humanitarian concern to come to the aid 
of ‘distant others’ lay partly in response to the practices 
of slavery in the transatlantic world (see Case study 8.4) 
and to the expansion of colonial settlement in the ‘age 
of empire’:
Not only did colonisation carry a metropolitan sense 
of responsibility into new Asian, North American, 
African and Australasian terrains, it also prompted 
humanitarians to formulate new antidotes, new 
‘cures’ for the ills of the world.
(Lester 2002: 278).
These new antidotes, cures and remedies were to 
have enduring significance for the shaping of twentieth-
century global development theory and practice, which 
also often carried an implicit ‘metropolitan sense of 
responsibility’. Colonial development was also asso-
ciated with an unconditional belief in the concept of 
progress and the ‘makeability’ of society, being ­heavily 
conditioned by the dominance of the evolutionary 
that many ‘underdeveloped’ areas had been stalled 
on the runway by unequal relations and a history of 
colonialism, denying them a chance of ever being air-
borne, ‘modern’ or ‘industrialized’. A dependence on 
natural resources can lead to slower growth and pat-
terns of development that are geographically uneven 
(see also Chapter 5 for a discussion of the ‘resource 
curse’ thesis).
In many ways, dependency approaches were so directly 
opposed to modernization approaches (almost point by 
point) that eventually both ‘seemed to checkmate each 
other’ (Schuurman 2001: 6). The dependency school even 
appeared to preserve the dualistic and binary classifica-
tion of the world into ‘developed’/’underdeveloped’, 
‘First World’ and ‘Third World’, core and periphery, 
and also lacked a clear statement of what ‘development’ 
actually is. Key criticisms directed at the dependentis-
tas were that the theory represents a form of ‘economic 
determinism’ and also overlooks social and cultural vari-
ation within developed and underdeveloped regions. The 
dependency framework seemed to leave the simplistic 
impression of an ‘evil genie who organizes the system, 
loading the dice and making sure the same people win 
all the time’ (Rist 1997: 122) and like modernization 
approaches it also dealt in dualistic either/or scenarios 
and viewed poverty in deprivationist terms. Another 
point of contention was that the dependency theorists 
seemed to be calling for a de-linking from the world capi-
talist economy at a time when it was undergoing further 
globalization and economic integration. Elements of the 
dependency writings were, however, quite thought-pro-
voking and remain relevant, particularly their contention 
that the obstacles to development equality were struc-
tural, arising not from a lack of will or poor weather 
conditions but from entrenched patterns of global ine-
quality and ‘dependent’ relationships.
8.3 Development practice:  
the historical geography of 
development
Whilst both modernization and dependency approaches 
alluded to the importance of ‘tradition’, many early 
writings about development lacked a sense of histori-
cal perspective (Rist 1997). As Crush (1995) points out, 
development is primarily ‘forward looking’, imagining a 
better world, and does not always examine issues of his-
torical and geographical context. Many recent histories 
of development have dated its beginnings as an area of 
theory and state practice to President Truman’s speech of 

180    Section 2  Population, resources, food, the environment and development
this came a missionary zeal to ‘civilize’ and modern-
ize the colonized and their ways of life. An important 
contention here then is that colonialism ‘conditioned’ 
the meanings and practices of development in a number 
of important ways.
thinking that was popular in Europe at the time. Impe-
rialism was viewed as a cultural and economic necessity 
where colonies were regarded as the national ‘property’ 
of the metropolitan countries and thus needed to be 
‘developed’ using the latest methods and ideas. With 
Case study 8.4 
Race, native lands and the origins of 
US capitalism and development
When US President Thomas Jefferson acquired the 
Louisiana Territory of 828,000 square miles of land 
from France in 1803 he envisioned an ‘empire for lib-
erty’ populated by self-sufficient white farmers. The 
plantation economy, however, that emerged in the Mis-
sissippi Valley in the years that followed can tell us a 
great deal about the development of capitalism in the 
United States and about the indigenous lands, African 
bodies and global trade networks that this depended 
upon. As Walter Johnson (2013) has shown, in many 
ways there was no nineteenth-century US capitalism 
without slavery. Beginning with the violent expropria-
tion and ‘ethnic cleansing’ of the land that indigenous 
agriculturalists (the Muskogee, Cherokee, Chickasaw 
and Choctaw nations) had farmed for millennia before 
the arrival of Europeans, the area was quickly trans-
formed into a frontier of accumulation by selling off the 
collective Native land base to individual capitalist plant-
ers. Using enslaved Africans, slaveholders then trans-
formed the Mississippi Valley into the Cotton Kingdom 
that formed the basis for US capitalism and world trade 
(Johnson 2013). In 1800, there were around 100,000 
slaves living within the boundaries of the present-day 
states of Mississippi and Louisiana but by 1860 there 
were more than 750,000 (Johnson 2013: 32). Although 
there were already some enslaved Africans in the area 
before the boom, approximately a million slaves were 
brought to the Mississippi Valley between 1820 and 
1840. Thus the slaveholding economy of the American 
South, which played a foundational role in the wider 
development of US capitalism, depended in large 
part on coerced African labour and the dispossession 
of indigenous lands. Britain was at the time the main 
industrial giant and imperialist power, and its primary 
industry was fuelled by US cotton. Most Mississippi 
Valley cotton went to Liverpool for sale, making up 
80 per cent of the cotton that British manufacturers 
imported (Johnson 2013). Thus the fortunes of cotton 
planters in Louisiana and cotton brokers in Liverpool, 
of the plantations of the Mississippi Valley and the 
textile mills of Manchester ‘were tied together through 
the cotton trade-the largest single sector of the global 
economy in the first half of the nineteenth century’ 
(Johnson 2013: 10). The slaveocracy that emerged 
around the Cotton Kingdom also laid the groundwork 
for wider continental expansion (America’s ‘mani-
fest destiny’) and US overseas imperialism through 
attempts to annex Nicaragua and Cuba in order to 
accumulate more land to distribute to the non-slave 
holders along with the US obsession with control of 
the Caribbean and Central America and other military/
imperialist ventures (Johnson 2013).
Similarly, Domosh (2015) has shown how some 
of the key elements of US international development 
practices in the post-war era can be traced back to the 
US South, a region considered ‘undeveloped’ in the first 
decades of the twentieth century, and the agricultural 
extension practices that targeted the rural farm home 
and farm women. This is one of a number of recent 
studies that trace US development practices to the first 
decades of the twentieth century, if not earlier, and to 
events that occurred as much within the USA as outside 
of it (Ekbladh 2002, 2010a, 2010b; Sneddon and Fox 
2011). Domosh (2015) examines the ways in which the 
Extension Service of the US Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) targeted rural women and the home as sites 
of modernization and development through a series of 
heavily gendered and racially segregated interventions. 
The US government then drew on its experiences with 
what was called Home Demonstration Work (HDW) in 
the American South in order to conduct ‘home work’ 
overseas, linking early US interventions into other coun-
tries under the guise of agricultural modernization with 
the USA’s own domestic agricultural extension service. 
Domosh (2015) argues that international develop-
ment – a form of hegemony different from but related to 
colonialism – thus needs to be understood not only as 
a geopolitical tool of the Cold War, but also as ‘a tech-
nique of governance that took shape within the realm of 
the domestic and through a racialized gaze developed 
in the US South’ (Domosh 2015: 3).

Chapter 8  Worlds apart? The changing geographies of global development      181
After 1945 and under US President Truman, ‘under-
development’ became the incomplete and ‘embryonic’ 
form of development and the gap was seen as bridgea-
ble only through an acceleration of growth (Rist 1997). 
Globally, development would have its ‘trustees’, guid-
ing ‘civilized’ nations that had the ‘capacity’ and the 
knowledge or expertise to organize land, labour and 
capital in the South on behalf of others. Quite a pater-
nal and parental style of relationship was therefore 
established through the imperial encounter between 
colonizer and colonized in ways which have continued 
to have a bearing on the definition of North–South 
partnerships in the ‘post-colonial’ world. ­Additionally, 
what is also relevant here is that many ‘post-­colonial’ 
states continue to maintain important political, 
­cultural and economic ties with their former colonial 
rulers (see Figure 8.1).
Colonialism put in place important political and 
economic relations but the cultural legacies of coloni-
alism bequeathed deep social and cultural divisions in 
many societies. In the process of decolonization, ‘devel-
opment’ became an overarching objective for many 
nationalist movements and the independent states they 
tried to form. Although experiments with development 
were tried in many colonies, the idea of development 
was invested with the hopes and dreams of many newly 
emerging states who wanted to address these inequali-
ties and divisions in their societies (Rahnema 1997). 
Decolonization was thus simultaneously an ideologi-
cal, material and spatial process, just as complicated as 
colonization (Pieterse and Parekh 1995). An important 
issue here concerns the extent to which colonial state 
machineries were reworked and transformed after inde-
pendence (Power 2003). The colonial state had rested 
on force for its legitimacy, a legitimacy that was thus 
highly superficial. Colonial states also had a role in cre-
ating political and economic communities, defining the 
rules of the game and the boundaries of community 
whilst creating power structures to dominate them. The 
colonial state was also the dominant economic actor, 
creating a currency, levying taxes, introducing crops, 
developing markets, controlling labour and production. 
Above all, colonial state administrations sought the inte-
gration of the colonial economy into the wider econo-
mies of empire, to make linkages with the metropole 
and to establish flows of peoples and resources. After 
the formal end of colonialism, new states have had to 
formulate alternative methods of garnering legitimacy 
for their authority (i.e. other than the use of force pre-
ferred by the colonists).

more fluid. In some ways, however, it would be more 
appropriate to refer to some of these countries as ‘re-
emerging economies’ as, until the nineteenth century, 
China and India were the world’s largest economies and 
dominated global output until the onset of Britain’s 
industrial revolution.
First coined in 2001 by an economist at the multi-
national global investment firm Goldman Sachs, the 
‘BRICs’ acronym (referring to Brazil, Russia, India and 
China) identified a group of four countries in particular 
that were, due to their scale, population size and growing 
share of global GDP, regarded as the leading non-West-
ern economies and as future motors of global economic 
change. The ‘BRICs’ acronym has since come into wide-
spread use as a symbol of the apparently epochal shift 
in global economic power away from the developed 
economies towards the ‘developing world’ and the wider 
realignment of world economic and ultimately political 
power that would be engendered by the collective influ-
ence of these four countries. South Africa began efforts 
to join the grouping in 2010 and the process for its for-
mal admission began in August of that year with South 
African President Jacob Zuma attending the 2011 BRICS 
summit as a full member.
With the inclusion of South Africa, the five BRICS 
countries now represent almost three billion people with 
a combined nominal GDP of US$16.039 trillion and an 
estimated US$4 trillion in combined foreign reserves 
(IMF 2013). Over the past decade, FDI inflows to the 
BRICS countries have more than tripled to an estimated 
US$322 billion in 2013 (UNCTAD 2014). As a result 
their share in world FDI flows kept rising even during 
the recent global economic crisis, reaching 22 per cent in 
2013, up from 6 per cent in 2000. The BRICS countries 
have also become important investors – their outward 
FDI has risen from US$7 billion in 2000 to US$126 bil-
lion in 2012 and now accounts for around 9 per cent of 
global flows, up from only 1 per cent in 2002 (UNCTAD 
2013). As a result, some countries of the global South are 
beginning to exert more influence on the ‘advanced’ and 
‘developed’ economies of western nations with signifi-
cant implications in terms of inflation, wages and unem-
ployment, profits and interest rates. Globally, increasing 
economic integration has made labour cheaper and more 
abundant with workers in developing countries conse-
quently losing some of their bargaining power. Further, 
the monopoly that western donors once had on devel-
opment finance (and the power to frame the terms and 
content of development debates) is being steadily eroded. 
(Power 2015).
The recent global economic crisis has also opened up 
space for the emerging economies of the global South to 
It is worth remembering that indigenous peoples in 
Africa, the Americas, Asia and Australasia had highly 
developed and sophisticated cultures and technologies 
prior to colonization (Dickenson et al. 1996). As the 
European capitalist system expanded and became ever 
more global in its reach however, the structures of eco-
nomic, social and political life that existed in colonies 
before colonialism were often radically remade. The his-
torical process by which ‘gaps’ began to emerge between 
‘North’ and ‘South’ has been interpreted in a variety of 
ways, but a key question has been: to what extent did 
European expansion and colonialism ‘underdevelop’ 
(Frank 1966) large areas of the world? The impact of 
imperial expansion was not uniform; the geographical 
patterns of expansion varied, as did the motivations for 
it. Hall (1992) argues that an important divide was put in 
place between ‘the West’ and ‘the rest’ as a direct result 
of this imperial expansion, reminding us that ‘the West’ 
is much more of an idea than a geographical reality. By 
accelerating contact between cultures and economies ‘the 
West’ was presented as ‘the best’ and most advanced or 
‘civilized’ of all humanity. Many accounts of the history 
of European expansion are thus dominated by the pre-
sumed supremacy of ‘Europe’ and ‘the West’ with only 
limited references to the complex histories and cultures 
of the areas that were colonized.
8.4 The ‘rising powers’ and the 
emergence of new ‘Southern’ 
donors
[T]he rapid and steady intrusion and recognition of a set of 
major emerging economies is challenging the established order, 
wrenching global relations into flux.
(Shaw et al. 2009: 27)
The United States emerged pre-eminent after the Sec-
ond World War and built a post-war international order 
around a range of governance institutions, including the 
United Nations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 
the World Bank, the General Agreement on ­Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) and regional security ­alliances. The end 
of the Cold War consolidated this American-led global 
institutional order, but in recent years a group of fast-
growing non-Western countries or ‘rising powers’ as 
they are sometimes referred to (namely China, India 
and ­Brazil) have been rising up the ranks of the world 
system as the boundaries used to differentiate rich and 
poor, ‘first’ and ‘third’ world countries are becoming 

Chapter 8  Worlds apart? The changing geographies of global development      183
is becoming clear is that the rapid and steady intrusion 
and recognition of a set of major emerging economies 
is challenging the established global order, ‘wrenching 
global relations into flux’ (Shaw et al. 2009: 27). As a 
result Western modernity is ‘no longer uncritically viewed 
as the future of developing countries’ (Humphrey 2007: 
16). These (re)emerging powers have economies that will 
rival the USA and Europe in the years ahead and they 
are already becoming an international economic force. 
Additionally these (re)emerging powers hold most of the 
world’s financial reserves and are placing significant new 
demands on energy and raw materials (many of which 
are being sourced from countries of the global South) 
with important implications for the environment and the 
prospects for addressing climate change and sustainable 
development goals.
The rise of countries like China, India and Brazil thus 
has potentially far-reaching implications for global geog-
raphies of development and the international landscape 
of development cooperation but also for the post-war 
institutions of governance in world politics. Further, 
many of these ‘rising powers’ are (re)emerging as aid 
donors themselves, providing development assistance to 
a range of other non-Western partners and often herald-
ing this as ‘South–South cooperation’. These ‘Southern’ 
donors are also questioning the very idea of development 
cooperation as a Western concept but also the develop-
ment paradigm as a whole (Six 2009). Brazil, China, 
India and South Africa not only espouse the cause of 
‘developing countries’ but are also vociferous in their 
assertions that they themselves belong to this group in 
ways that are reminiscent of older Third Worldist coali-
tions that some of these countries led at different points 
in the past such as Bandung (Narlikar 2013). Part of their 
appeal as ‘development donors’ (Mawdsley 2012) is that 
they don’t have the same imperial histories of colonizing 
large parts of the global South that many existing West-
ern donors do. Paradoxically, these ‘new’ donors repre-
sent models of economic success, yet they have been, or 
are still, recipients of international aid. Although India, 
for example, is a donor (aid expenditures reached US$1.3 
billion in 2014–15, more than double New Delhi’s antic-
ipated net foreign aid receipts of US$655 million that 
financial year) it was the world’s eighth-largest recipient 
of official development assistance as recently as 2008 (to 
the value of US$2.1 billion) and was fourth overall from 
1995 to 2009. Further, considerable levels of poverty and 
inequality remain within each of the BRICS despite the 
many claims that have been made about their ‘miracu-
lous growth’.
play an increasingly active role in the reform of global 
economic and political governance, to the extent that a 
‘regime change’ in global governance is now at least a dis-
tinct possibility (Gray and Murphy 2013). This has been 
characterized by some as the beginning of a transition 
from a unipolar US hegemony to one of ‘emancipatory 
multipolarity’ (Pieterse 2011), in which the countries that 
represent the majority of the world’s peoples now have a 
position at the head table, or even as a broader underly-
ing ‘global centre shift’ or ‘hegemonic transition’ (Gills 
2011). Reforming the governance of the IMF and the 
World Bank has been a central component in the strategy 
of ‘global power diffusion’ pursued by the BRICS. They 
have argued that the West is overrepresented in the IMF at 
the expense of developing countries and have called for a 
greater share of votes and a change in what they see as the 
organization’s obsolete governance. As they are becom-
ing growing net contributors to the IMF, the BRICS are 
thus pressing for a greater voice within the institution, 
even threatening to hold back the additional financing 
requested by the IMF to fight the European debt crisis 
unless they gained greater IMF voting power.
There have also been discussions about the creation 
of a parallel mechanism to the World Bank including 
proposals for a ‘BRICS development bank’ that would 
lend to infrastructure projects and the facilitation of 
sustainable development in the countries of the group-
ing themselves as well as other developing countries. 
More generally, the BRICS have also focused on the 
need for national policy autonomy and have been criti-
cal of the global economic governance frameworks that 
introduce rules and norms corresponding to dominant 
country interests. The BRICS have also been instrumen-
tal in establishing regional development banks that have 
eroded the primacy of the IMF and World Bank as lend-
ers in Asia and Latin America and have agreed to use 
their own currencies when trading among themselves, 
effectively reducing their dependence on the US dollar 
as the main currency of trade.
There is no doubt then that in recent years both the 
architecture of international governance and the estab-
lished modes of development cooperation have been 
increasingly transformed by the (re)emergence of the 
rising powers as development donors with important 
implications for global geographies of investment, pro-
duction and trade (Power and Mohan 2010). Twenty 
years ago, it would have been difficult to imagine Brazil 
as the main regional leader in Latin America, India as a 
major player in the WTO, or China as the second largest 
economy in the world (Vom Hau et al 2012), but what

8.5 Conclusions: geography, 
unevenness and inequality
The idea of development stands like a ruin in the intellectual 
landscape. Delusion and disappointment, failures and crimes 
have been the steady companions of development and they tell a 
common story: it did not work. Moreover, the historical condi-
tions which catapulted the idea into prominence have vanished: 
development has become outdated.
(Sachs 1992: 1).
Development is nearly always seen as something that is 
possible, if only people or countries follow through a 
series of stages or prescribed instructions. Many theories, 
strategies and ideologies have thus sought to prescribe 
how development could or should proceed and ‘devel-
opment thinking’ has long been caught in a ‘Western’ 
perception of reality and been based around ‘Western’ 
philosophies, knowledges, experiences and histories. 
There is a sense, however, that despite the wide variety 
of interventions that have been made in its name the 
‘project’ of Development has been accompanied by a 
common story: that it ‘did not work’ and that its ‘steady 
companions’ have been ‘delusion and disappointment, 
failures and crimes’ (Sachs 1992: 1).
Some critics have even argued that historically 
­Development is in many ways a dubious solution in search 
of a problem (Escobar 2011) and has thus ‘created abnor-
malities’ such as poverty, underdevelopment, backward-
ness and landlessness before proceeding to address them 
in ways that deny value or initiative to local cultures and 
that prevent individuals from making their own histories 
and geographies under conditions of their own choosing. 
More importantly, there is also a sense in which the his-
torical conditions that gave rise to the idea of D/develop-
ment have fundamentally changed and a sense that the 
idea lies ‘in ruins’ or has become ‘outdated’. Some of the 
prior meta-geographical demarcations that have shaped 
development theory and practice, the categories such as 
‘Developed’ and ‘Third World’ which emerged after 1945, 
and which have ‘long provided key points of reference, 
commitment, analysis and mobilisation’ (Sidaway 2012), 
have shattered and are breaking down in part because of 
the emergence of the BRICS and the rising economies of 
the South.
Many recent critiques of development thus appear 
disillusioned with the future of the development indus-
try and its capacity to understand and alleviate world 
poverty. Further, many politicians in Western countries 
are only gradually beginning to wake up to the realities 
of these contemporary global inequalities. A number of 
them see these concerns as those of distant geographies, 
a world of problems pushed and ‘worlded’ beyond the 
universe of immediate moral concern even though the 
lines that have historically divided ‘North’ and ‘South’, 
‘First World’ and ‘Third World’ are now present within 
every nation-state. The effects of poverty and inequality 
(a bit like those of climate change) are thus regarded as 
diffuse and long-term (Wade 2001). Additionally, rather 
than thinking of a single, interconnected and interde-
pendent global economic system, this impoverishment 
and inequity is constructed as somehow unique or 
exclusive to the peoples of particular spaces of global 
Development such as the ‘Third World’. If our concern 
is to build a more radical development geography then 
it needs to be understood that poverty also occurs in 
‘developed’ countries and that the aid and ‘development’ 
policies of such countries, far from being a part of the 
solution, may actually be considered a part of the prob-
lem. Marginality and deprivation (or for that matter, 
excessive consumption amongst the affluent) in Europe, 
North America or Russia and other post-communist 
‘transition economies’ should also be seen foremost as 
issues of ‘development’.
The rapid economic growth experienced by (re)emerg-
ing powers in the South like Brazil, India and China, 
and their increasingly significant roles in development 
cooperation and aid disbursement, requires us to adopt 
a framework for analysis that is liberated from the tyr-
anny of dualism and that allows for changes in the world 
economy and variation within and between states. Their 
collective size and impact on trade, finance, energy, and 
the environment will make them important players in the 
years to come. This also means moving beyond the tragic 
stereotypes of a single condition of ‘Third World poverty’ 
and a single ‘geography of the Third World’. This could 
make a world of difference.

Section 3
Society, settlement and culture
Edited by Tim Hall

Geographers are interested in difference, the 
ways places differ, and also in the similarities and 
interconnections between places. But the changes 
that human societies have experienced since the 
late twentieth century render the geographer’s 
task of making sense of the world increasingly 
­difficult. Old dichotomies, like that between ‘urban’ 
and ‘rural’, and the lines which geographers have 
­customarily drawn on their maps to divide country 
from country, region from region and culture from 
culture, seem to make less sense in a dynamic 
globalizing environment. Even so the results of 
such processes seem not to be a world that is 
more uniform. While distant places interconnect 
and interact with increasing intimacy, new spaces 
appear where people are excluded from such 
developments, and almost everywhere some indi-
viduals who share spaces with others are denied 
the rights and advantages that the latter enjoy.
It is such complexities, making themselves felt 
in urban and rural spaces and in the spheres of 
culture and nature, that form the subject of this 
section.
The world has become more urban. But the expe-
rience of urbanization differs radically between 
cities, spaces within cities, and for different indi-
viduals. The corollary is that the world has become 
less rural, but again those spaces, and the indi-
viduals within them, are affected in very different 
ways by such processes. Further, culture seems to 
be assuming ever greater importance in the world. 
Issues like identity and the meanings and ways of 
life that are shared by, or that divide, individuals 
and groups become matters of concern, contesta-
tion and even conflict. These processes are inter-
acting though with an increasingly vulnerable and 
contested global ecology.
Chapter 9 looks at cities, the roles cities now 
play in global and regional economic and power 
networks is addressed before the chapter turns 
to examine urban problems like poverty, cul-
tural diversity and environmental sustainability 
and how these might best be understood and 
addressed. Chapter 10 on urban segregation 
and social inequalities argues that all modern 
societies are riddled with inequalities. It dem-
onstrates that one of the clearest ways in which 
social disadvantage is reflected is through its 
geographical expression, particularly in the 
existence of spaces described as being ‘on 
the margins’. Chapter 11, ‘Rural worlds’, ana-
lyzes the alternative consequences for both 
rural spaces and individuals of the processes 
of urbanization and globalization. Chapter 12 
on social constructions of nature argues that 
nature is not some pre-given physical reality, 
existing totally outside ourselves, but is in fact 
an idea which is constructed by society. It is 
never easy to draw a line between things that 
are deemed ‘natural’ and things that are ‘social’, 
and different ways of conceiving of what is 
‘natural’ can be used to advance particular 
political agendas. Chapter 13, which looks at 
culture, defines it as a process and as a sys-
tem of shared meanings. The argument is that 
globalization is not producing a single global 
culture although the idea of a global culture is 
becoming important. It debunks the myth that 
globalization equates with cultural homogeniza-
tion. Global cultural processes interact with pro-
cesses occurring at national and regional levels 
to produce a complex world in which it is neces-
sary to foster approaches that will welcome and 
celebrate cultural differences rather than shun 
and fear them.
This section makes clear the fact that the 
­geography of a globalizing world is as much a 
geography of exclusion and difference as it is one 
of ­interconnection and interlinkage.

Chapter 9

T
here is a tendency, certainly within the media but also 
at times within the academic discourse of urban 
geography, to talk about cities in very unequivocal terms. 
Talking about cities in this way tends to perpetuate cer-
tain urban myths. Pro-urban myths include seeing the 
city as civilized, modern, liberating, exciting or perhaps 
romantic, while anti-urban myths see the city as ugly, 
alienating, corrupting, dirty or dangerous, amongst other 
things. The tendency to talk about cities in this way is 
not new. A number of commentators have recognized 
the existence of urban myths throughout history, trac-
ing the earliest to Ancient Greece and Rome (Williams 
1973; Gold and Revill 2004; Short 2006). Urban myths 
are significant in that they reflect widely held cultural 
attitudes towards the urban. They tell us what societies 
think about cities at different times. These urban myths 
are also significant because they are still constantly 
reproduced. This is not to suggest that these impressions 
are untrue, rather that there is a tendency when we talk 
about the city to focus on these eye-catching aspects and 
to exaggerate them at the expense of the subtleties and 
complexities that exist in cities. However, it is important 
not to dismiss this way of thinking about cities entirely. 
Such myths emphasize the sheer diversity of the urban 
world and begin to provide a framework for understand-
ing and working through this diversity. Yet relying entirely 
on them as a guide carries with it the danger that much 
of the detail that makes up the daily ‘stuff’ of urban life 
eludes analysis. A review of almost any local newspaper, 
for example, tells of a range of more mundane concerns 
that typically constitute the daily life of cities. Gloucester 
is a small city in the south-west of England. Its newspa-
per, The Citizen, for example, regularly runs stories on 
issues such as the problems caused by an infestation of 
seagulls in the city centre, recurrent minor incidents of 
anti-social behaviour and vandalism, deaths and injuries 
caused by traffic accidents, financial problems affect-
ing independent retailers, educational successes of local 
schools, and reports from the city’s sports clubs. This 
daily diet of local news is typical of cities the world over. 
Such mundane issues though are rarely the substantive 
concerns of urban geographers who tend to focus on the 
‘big issues’ rather than the minutiae of life in the city:
Urban geography and urban studies is a discipline 
populated by Big Things. Cities for a start. They are 
by definition big. Motorways and mass transportation 
systems, urban redevelopment projects, and suburban 
shopping malls are pretty big too. Then there are 
skyscrapers, mega-projects, new-towns, edge cities, 
again all large, obvious, written across the landscape 
and close to the heart of urban geography’s sense of 
itself . . . Given its attraction to the Big, it is perhaps 
of little surprise that urban geography has not been 
particularly good at, or indeed often has not been 
interested in, making sense of many of the smaller 
elements that make up a city.
(Latham 2008: 215–15)
A corollary of this tendency within urban geography 
to see the city in unequivocal terms has been the ten-
dency to focus on a narrow range of big cities, such as 
Los Angeles, London, Mexico City and Tokyo, where the 
processes of urbanization are manifested most clearly 
and spectacularly. However, it would be wrong to dismiss 
both the mundane concerns outlined above and smaller, 
seemingly less interesting cities. These concerns make up 
the fabric of everyday life for the majority of urban dwell-
ers and, despite their large population sizes, the majority 
of the world’s urban population do not live in large cities 
but in smaller urban settlements (Bell and Jayne 2006):
52 per cent of the world’s urban population resides in 
cities and towns of less than 500,000 people. A similar 
picture is painted for developed and developing coun-
tries, as 54 and 51 per cent of their urban population, 
respectively, live in such cities. Despite the attention 
they command, megacities – cities with over 10 million 
people – are home to only 9 per cent of the world’s 
urban population.
(UN HABITAT 2009: 27)
Further, although the issues above may seem trivial or 
of only limited interest in themselves, they constitute part 
of much bigger, broader, more significant and wide-rang-
ing urban issues and for this reason deserve our attention. 
Thus, we need to try to appreciate the fine grain of daily 
urban life, the big issues and the relations between these. 
This chapter, then, aims to outline ways to think through 
the complexity and diversity of the urban world and to 
talk about the ways that geographers have tried to recon-
cile both big issues and more mundane concerns in their 
work. It will do this first by focusing on three aspects 
of cities that form enduring themes in urban geography, 
which can be thought of as the multiple geographies of 
the urban world, as follows:
●
●
 The macro-geography of the urban world: the ways 
in which processes of contemporary urbanization are 
changing the distribution of the urban population 
around the world.
●
●The host of networks and connections that exist 
between cities and the effects that these webs of con-
nections have on cities.
●
●
 The diversity of the internal worlds of individual 
cities.

Chapter 9  Cities: urban worlds    191
(1907/1978), and Louis Wirth’s essay ‘Urbanism as a way 
of life’ (1938). Influential in their time, they have been the 
subject of much debate across a number of disciplines 
concerned with questions of the urban. Broadly speaking, 
Simmel’s perspective was temporal, arguing that the cul-
ture of the modern period (roughly from 1850 onwards) 
has been urban, while Wirth’s was spatial, seeking to 
recognize distinctly urban qualities that differed from 
those of the rural. Simmel’s concern was primarily with 
the effects of the development of the money economy in 
the modern period on social relations. He argued that it 
produced blazé, reserved, instrumental relations between 
people that are found at their most developed in cities, the 
centres of the money economy. This he contrasted with 
the social relations of earlier historical periods. Simmel’s 
work has often been misinterpreted as attributing causal-
ity to cities. However, it was money rather than cities per 
se which, he argued, produced the distinctive social rela-
tions that he observed (Byrne 2001; Savage et al. 2003; 
Hubbard 2006). Wirth, by contrast, attempted to show 
that the characteristics of cities, notably their size, density 
and heterogeneity, produced social relations of a different 
type to rural areas:
Wirth’s basic argument was that city life was charac-
terized by isolation and social disorganization, and 
that this was due to the fact that all cities were large, 
dense and heterogeneous.
(Savage et al. 2003: 108)
Although undoubtedly pioneering and influential, 
these works have failed subsequently to sustain the notion 
that distinctly urban qualities, processes and ways of life 
exist. Criticisms, particularly of Wirth’s arguments, have 
included the recognition of many cultural groups within 
cities, a plethora of subcultures rather than the singular 
urban culture that Wirth proposed, and the identifica-
tion of close-knit communities in cities, though ones 
frequently undergoing profound change (Hoggart 1957; 
Young and Wilmot 1962), which runs counter to Wirth’s 
assertions of isolation and social disorganization as the 
key characteristics of urban society (Byrne 2001; Savage 
et al. 2003).
Defining the urban for administrative purposes, the 
measurement, management and planning of cities, has 
proven equally problematic as attempts to define it soci-
ologically. Amongst administrative definitions of the 
urban, population size is perhaps the most basic criterion 
used to define the nature of settlements. Internationally 
though there are huge variations in the ways in which 
this criterion is applied. While in parts of Scandinavia 
a settlement of 300 can be classed as urban, in Japan 
only settlements whose population size exceeds 30,000 
Although these will be considered separately here, it 
should be remembered that they are interrelated issues. 
Each of these aspects affects the others. These can be 
thought of as some of the basic or fundamental ques-
tions of urban geography. Geographers have sought to 
explore these in a variety of ways over time devising often 
radically different theoretical perspectives on them. As 
Paddison argues:
Historically then, the study of cities is identifiable 
with continuities and discontinuities – continuities 
in terms of the basic questions cities pose, discon-
tinuities in terms of how they have been studied and 
theorised.
(Paddison 2001: 4)
The discussion of these basic questions is situated 
within a reflection on some key recent theoretical debates 
and challenges within urban geography. The chapter con-
cludes by a looking at a number of contemporary issues. 
While some of these have echoes in earlier phases of 
urban geography, others have emerged more recently.
9.1 Defining the urban world
Trying to define the urban world is fraught with difficulty. 
One does not need to be a student of urban geography 
to recognize characteristics of urban settlements and the 
differences between cities, towns and villages. However, 
organizing this understanding systematically and using 
it to define what and where is urban has proven more 
problematic. Fundamentally we need to ask if we can rec-
ognize any qualities that are uniquely or distinctly urban. 
Although there are undoubtedly differences between 
rural and urban, the question here becomes: are these 
differences of type or of degree? This question formed 
the basis of a significant strand of sociological debate 
during the twentieth century.
The search for qualities or processes that are uniquely 
urban has long been at the heart of sociological enquiry 
into the city. This originated in the work of Ferdinand Toe-
nnies (1887) who distinguished between Gemeinschaft 
(traditional communities) and Gesellschaft (modern 
societies characterized by more instrumental social rela-
tions). This spawned a tradition of sociological enquiry 
that explored the supposed differences between rural 
and urban societies and the ways of life that character-
ized them (Savage et al. 2003: 109). The most influential 
of these were the work of Georg Simmel, particularly his 
essay ‘The metropolis and mental life’ (1903/2004) and the 
longer treatment of his ideas in The Philosophy of Money 

192    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
rounds of urbanization in many parts of the developed 
world. Often edge cities straddle administrative bounda-
ries, fragmenting their true form and extent within offi-
cial statistical returns. The rapidity with which edge cities 
have colonized rural land in some areas means that where 
these processes are at their most prevalent, the adminis-
trative framework of regions is more a reflection of his-
torical rather than contemporary processes and patterns 
of urbanization. The amorphous nature of postmodern 
urbanization has led some to question whether edge cities 
and associated settlement forms should be thought of as 
cities at all (Pile 1999: 30). This neatly returns us to the dif-
ficult sociological questions of the urban discussed above.
While acknowledging that it is difficult to define 
exactly what and where is urban, it should not be 
assumed from this that urban questions are unimpor-
tant. ‘Cityness’, namely the density, not only of people 
but also of institutions and built forms (Pile 1999), and 
the intense heterogeneity and juxtapositions of cities, 
clearly matter (Amin and Thrift 2002: 2). The nature 
and quality of urban life are different in different places 
and this is influenced in large part by the surroundings 
within which urban lives are lived. Living in a suburb of 
a small European town, for example, is very different to 
living in the heart of Tokyo. While we should not fall 
into the trap of fetishising the city, of attaching unique-
ness and causality to its qualities, we should not dismiss 
the differences within and across the urban world. Indeed 
geography is all about acknowledging these differences 
and this has emerged as a key aspect of recent theoretical 
debates in urban geography. Differences in the nature of 
places matter and have effects on the creative possibilities 
open to urban dwellers (Florida 2002) and to the fears and 
problems they face (Valentine 1989; Patel 2000; Hayward 
2004; Aas 2007).
9.2 Multiple geographies of the 
urban world
9.2.1 Global patterns of urbanization
Current trends in urbanization are changing the macro-
geographies of the urban world. By macro-geographies 
we mean broad patterns in the distribution of the global 
urban population (see Pacione 2009: Chapter 5). The 
extent to which different regions of the world are urban-
ized varies hugely. This is a long-standing historical fea-
ture in which, generally, levels of urbanization correlate 
with those of economic development. The most highly 
urbanized nations, then, have tended to be the most 
economically developed. Consequently, until the mid 
qualify. Higher population densities are often cited as a 
characteristic of urban areas but here again there is no 
natural or universally agreed cut-off point that separates 
urban from non-urban settlements. Indeed, the extensive 
depopulation that has recently been observed in some old 
de-industrialized cities such as Detroit in the USA and 
across parts of Eastern and Central Europe (Hall and 
Pfeiffer 2000; Oswalt 2004) has meant that large parts 
of these long-established urban areas now have very low 
population densities.
The task of drawing boundaries around cities, sug-
gesting a neat separation from rural areas beyond, is 
further complicated by the ambiguous nature of the 
rural–urban fringe or peri-urban zone. Here is a zone 
where rural and urban functions intermingle and where 
often substantial components of the hidden infrastruc-
ture of the city, such as sewage works, power plants and 
server farms, along with major transport and distribution 
functions such as airports and motorways sit in otherwise 
rural surroundings. Many rapidly growing cities in the 
Global South have extensive peri-urban areas containing 
a mosaic of urban and rural-agricultural land uses and 
activities, these zones providing a home for many of the 
new migrants to these cities (Simon 2008). Commenta-
tors have long argued over whether these zones should 
be more accurately defined as rural, urban, transitional 
zones, or as something altogether quite different and dis-
tinct (Gallent 2006; Gallent and Anderson 2007). A walk 
around these areas soon demolishes the impression that 
there is a neat break between urban and rural.
While the landscapes of the rural–urban fringes of 
many cities are regarded as somewhat prosaic outcomes 
of urbanization, the edges of some, particularly Ameri-
can, cities are regarded as more spectacular manifesta-
tions of these processes. The processes operating here 
and their outcomes reveal the inability of a relatively 
static administrative framework to contain the dynamic 
and unruly processes of late capitalist urbanization. Edge 
cities, as they are generally referred to, are settlements 
that contain many of the traditional functions of cities 
but which have grown rapidly through private develop-
ment during the last 30 years. They owe their name to 
their location on the edges of, or at times beyond, exist-
ing cities. They seem to be producing new geographies 
of the urban world, prompting some commentators to 
suggest that they represent a new postmodern phase of 
urban history very different from that of the nineteenth 
and twentieth centuries (Dear and Flusty 1998; Soja 1989, 
1996, 2000; Dear 2000). We look at some of these new 
geographies of the urban world in the following section. 
Edge cities, though, can be thought of as alternatives to 
the city rather than extensions to it, as in the case of sub-
urbs which constitute the archetypal landscape of earlier 

Chapter 9  Cities: urban worlds    193
reflection of broad trends in national or international eco-
nomics. For some cities, however, there are signs that the 
process of decline might be more terminal. These include 
manufacturing cities in the north-eastern United States, 
such as Detroit, and many in Eastern and Central Europe. 
Here an almost total reliance on industries that have now 
declined or relocated globally, a failure to stimulate sig-
nificant economic growth in Eastern Europe since 1989, 
and stark inequalities within the deeply racially divided 
populations of the North American rustbelt, appear to 
be keys in understanding the problem.
The most significant growth in the urban world in the 
last 30 years has taken place in those regions with tra-
ditionally low percentages of urban populations, namely 
Africa and Asia. Asia has witnessed particularly rapid 
urban growth during this period, headed by China and 
India, something that is predicted to continue into the 
foreseeable future. Despite both continents experiencing 
significant urban growth, the nature of growth in Africa 
and Asia has been quite different. While China, for exam-
ple, has seen growth in its urban populations concentrated 
largely in major urban centres, Africa’s has predominantly 
taken place in small and intermediate cities. Yet, concerns 
have been raised about the volatility and longer-term 
­sustainability of much of this rapid urban growth. In 
China, a number of under-occupied ‘ghost cities’ have 
emerged fuelled by unstable economic conditions and 
volatility in local property markets (see Case study 9.1).
These broad changes in the macro-geographies of the 
urban world are captured clearly in shifts in the number 
and location of the world’s mega-cities  (cities with more 
than 10 million inhabitants) (Figure 9.1). The United 
Nations predicts that the number of these cities will 
increase to 41 in 2030 and that the majority of them will 
be located outside the developed world. The rapid recent 
urban growth and its concentration in large settlements 
twentieth century, significant urban development was 
largely concentrated in Europe, North America and Latin 
America. However, since then, urban growth in these 
regions has been slow with only modest growth in the 
proportion of their populations living in towns and cities. 
In addition, within these regions there has been uneven 
growth by city size, with the largest growth occurring 
in smaller urban areas. This reflects the changing eco-
nomic geographies of key sectors in these regions and the 
choices of mature urban populations for suburban living 
and relocation to smaller urban areas and the countryside 
(Champion 1999).
The fate of large cities in these regions has been 
mixed. A small number of global or major capital cities, 
such as London, Paris and New York, have maintained 
their position or grown in population and influence dur-
ing this period. This has occurred mainly on the back of 
the growth of their financial sectors and their primacy 
within international, national and regional economic 
systems (Short 2004; Kim 2008). These cities have not 
been without their problems though. Many have seen 
significant shrinkage in their manufacturing sectors cou-
pled with problems related to their failure to adequately 
accommodate, manage and plan for large immigrant 
populations (Sandercock 1998, 2003; Saunders 2010). 
The problems of Paris’ North African immigrant popula-
tions that culminated in civil disturbances in a number of 
suburban banlieues typify this (Wacquant 2007). Whereas 
bald population statistics suggest overall buoyancy in 
these cities there has been widespread redrawing of their 
internal social geographies and this has not been without 
cost (see Chapter 10).
Second-tier, regional cities, particularly those with a 
large manufacturing economy, have tended to struggle in 
the latter half of the twentieth century. While this is the 
result of a general global shift of manufacturing away 
from its traditional heartlands (see Chapter 14) the out-
comes of this are mediated locally. Since the 1950s many 
of these cities have suffered significant population loss 
as their manufacturing economies have contracted. Liv-
erpool, in the north-west of England, for example, lost 
an average of 10,000 people per year during the 1970s. 
Attempts to regenerate many cities of this type through 
ambitious property-led, city centre developments seemed 
to be stemming this decline as, by the late 1990s, many 
cities such as Liverpool, which had experienced long-term 
decline, were seeing their populations stabilize and even 
in some cases grow slightly. These optimistic signs have 
been tempered somewhat in recent years, however, as the 
global recession has impacted on the financial, business, 
travel and property sectors around which these urban 
renaissances have typically been constructed (Martin 
2010). The fortunes of many of these cities seem to be a

Case study 9.1 
China’s ‘Ghost City’
The rapid pace of urbanization in China has been a key 
feature of global urbanization trends in the early twenty-
first century. In 1990, 26 per cent of people in China lived 
in cities; in 2014 this was 54 per cent and is expected to 
rise to 76 per cent by 2050. Presently, 16 of the world’s 71 
urban agglomerations containing over 5 million people 
are in China (United Nations 2014d). However, for all the 
spectacular urban growth of major cities such as ­Beijing, 
Shanghai and Shenzhen other cities in China have expe-
rienced more mixed fortunes, with new urban develop-
ment plans falling foul of overheated property market 
speculation and a slow-down in economic growth. This 
has spawned the curious presence of a number of over-
built and under-populated ‘ghost cities’, where new urban 
development lies empty awaiting the arrival of people.
Perhaps the most well known of these is the new city 
development of Kangbashi, in the Ordos District of Inner 
Mongolia. Traditionally a sparsely populated poor rural 
region, the Ordos District has boomed economically in 
recent years as a result of the exploitation of its coal 
reserves. This resource boom and its resulting wealth 
provided the impetus for the local leadership to embark 
on an ambitious urbanization plan with the goal of build-
ing a ‘one million person metropolis’. The plan was to 
develop an urban district with a new city, Kangbashi, 
linked to the old urban core of Dongsheng. When devel-
opment of Kangbashi began in 2004, Ordos seemed 
set to become a spectacular jewel in China’s crown of 
city states. Kangbashi’s role was to be the administra-
tive, cultural and economic centre of the municipality, 
with a full range of urban functions, infrastructure, and 
abundant cultural and leisure amenities. The scale of the 
development has been huge, with large squares, wide 
roads and the building of an immense square footage of 
municipal and residential buildings, with dozens of high-
rise apartment towers and hotels. The new city is also 
packed with monuments and cultural references that 
evoke the Mongolian heritage of the area. Images of the 
city’s spectacular architectural excesses have captured 
the imagination of the outside world.
To boost settlement in the new city the municipal 
government moved its administrative offices, key medi-
cal facilities and top-ranking schools to Kangbashi. 
However, despite this the pace of settlement has been 
slow, due to a number of overlapping causes. First, 
despite incentives, commercial businesses have been 
slow to open up, citing lack of customers, and this lack 
of basic conveniences has discouraged households 
from relocating. Second, many native Ordos residents 
have purchased homes in Kangbashi primarily as 
second homes or investment properties. This fuelled 
a vibrant speculative real estate market between 2006 
and 2011, with high prices stimulating further building 
but constraining residential settlement. More recently 
the development of the new city has slowed with the 
bursting of the local credit and real estate bubble in 
2011, linked to a fall in coal prices related to the wider 
slow-down in China’s economic growth rate. The 
resulting proliferation of unoccupied residential and 
commercial buildings in the new city, many abandoned 
mid-construction, has captured media attention around 
the world and led to its labelling as China’s largest 
‘ghost city’. Commentators have subsequently seized 
on Ordos as a metaphor for the arrogance and reck-
lessness of China’s rampant urbanization.
It is clear that the pace and scale of urban growth 
during the boom years was unsustainable, and the key 
concerns now are dealing with the accumulation of 
vacant property and continuing to attract people, mainly 
local famers, to relocate to Kangbashi. However, here 
challenges remain. Simply pushing unskilled farmers into 
urban labour has not translated into disposable incomes 
high enough to maintain a life in the city for many as gov-
ernment compensation packages have been reduced. 
Educating the farmers is now a key goal for the Ordos 
government, ensuring new residents have the skills nec-
essary to obtain jobs and live a purposeful urban life.
The situation in Ordos has informed broader debates 
on urban development in China. It can be seen as a 
‘test run’ for the Chinese government’s plans to urban-
ize the rural interior of the country over the next two 
decades. In 2014, the Chinese government released 
the ‘National New-Type Urbanization Plan’, which 
announced the intention to increase the proportion of 
the nation’s population living in cities to 60 per cent by 
2020, which would mean bringing 100 million new resi-
dents to cities. The proliferation of similar failed projects 
in cities around China has raised questions about this 
model of urban development and how to temper exces-
sive speculative development in real estate and balance 
housing supply and demand. The longer-term success 
of Kangbashi is far from certain, and in the meantime 
it has become something of a tourist spectacle and a 
curiosity for urban scholars around the world.

It is perhaps not surprising that in a global age the issue

predicted increasingly to dominate the mega-city league

and Latin America, such as New York–Newark and Mex-

to this that has attracted the attention of urban analysts 
has been that of power in the urban world. Namely, does 
this changing geography of mega-cities represent a shift

financial and producer service offices, air travel, finan-
cial flows and electronic communications data to map the 
networks and connections that flow between the world’s 
cities. Using these methods it is possible to rank cities 
according to their connectivity and apparent influence 
within the global economy.
Using these measures, it is possible, for example, for 
some relatively large cities to be poorly connected, and 
hence marginal, in the current age despite their size. 
John Rennie Short (2004; see also Hubbard 2006: 180) 
cites cities such as Teheran (Iran), Dhaka (Banglagesh), 
Chongqing (China) and Khartoum (Sudan) as examples 
of such cities. Dhaka was actually the eleventh largest 
city in the world in 2014 with a population of 16,982,000 
and is estimated to become the world’s sixth largest city 
by 2030 (United Nations 2014d). However, despite this 
it is relatively little connected into global financial net-
works, nor is it a major global trade hub or centre of 
global media networks, except those serving the Bangla-
deshi diaspora. In all the attempts to quantify the sig-
nificance and levels of connectivity of the world’s major 
cities (see Sassen 1994; Smith and Timberlake 1995; 
Taylor 2004; Derudder and Wilcox 2005) it occupies a 
very lowly position, if it is present at all. This relational 
analysis provides a glimpse of the nature, distribution 
and operation of power in a global age. However, it has 
drawn some criticism for its focus on data that reflect the 
processes of Western economic globalization, thus ignor-
ing other potentially important dimensions of contem-
porary globalization (Short et al. 1996; Robinson 2006). 
Hierarchies of global cities of culture, religion or politics, 
for example, might look quite different from those eco-
nomic rankings that have prevailed in analysis to date. 
This is not to dismiss the importance of this global cities 
research, rather, to argue that it represents only one take 
on globalization, albeit arguably the most significant, 
amongst many.
9.2.3 The internal structure of cities
The trajectories of urban development vary a great deal 
around the globe. They reflect the particular combina-
tions of local and general factors that come together in 
different times and at different places. Consequently the 
internal worlds of cities are similarly complex and hetero-
geneous. Despite this, geographers have expended a great 
deal of effort attempting to find patterns and regularities 
within this complexity and devise models of the inter-
nal structure of cities. Some of the most influential work 
in the subject is reflective of this tradition within urban 
geography (see Burgess et al. 1925; Hoyt 1939; Harris 
and Ullman 1945; Shevky and Bell 1955; Mann 1965; Soja 
1989, 1996, 2000; Dear and Flusty 1998; Dear 2000). Work 
of cities. Connectivity simply refers to the connections 
that exist between places, although in actuality the nature 
of these connections is often highly complex. Commonly 
places are connected through the movement of goods, 
people, information, ideas and money. The current age 
is often represented as one of connection and cities act 
as vital hubs in global or regional networks of various 
kinds. Connectivity between cities is not a characteristic 
of the recent past. Networks of trade, politics, empire 
and travel, for example, are observable back to ancient 
history. However, recent technological changes that have 
led to the development of truly global communications 
systems have wrought both qualitative and quantita-
tive discontinuities in the nature of these networks. The 
speed, capacity, intensity, quantity and quality of the con-
nections between cities has grown significantly since the 
1980s (Harvey 1989; Dodge and Kitchen 2000; Hubbard 
2006). While not dismissing the importance of historical 
connections and networks stretching around the world 
(see Sheppard 2002) the ubiquity and intensity of con-
nection in the current age is unparalleled. Social scientists 
have been quick to pick up on the significance of this. For 
example, they have adopted various forms of network or 
relational approach (Dicken et al. 2001; Sheppard 2002; 
Bosco 2006; Murdoch 2006) that have sought to prob-
lematize the sedentary tendencies of much traditional 
social theory. Both have been influential in reshaping 
urban geography in recent years (see Spotlight box 9.1).
The example of London in Spotlight box 9.1 reminds 
us that, if the contemporary world is a networked one, 
then the major nodes in these networks are cities. It is 
here that all major networks coalesce, be they networks 
of travel and migration, trade, communication, finance 
or politics. These networks do not coalesce evenly across 
the urban world, however. Inevitably there is a geogra-
phy to these networks within which some cities are sig-
nificantly more important nodes than others. It is here 
that an important relationship between connectivity and 
power begins to emerge that destabilizes earlier notions 
of power associated with cities that were, in large part, 
related to the size of those cities. For many years it has 
been taken for granted that the largest cities were the most 
important. The relational view of cities, though, raises 
some questions about the validity of this assumption. 
Rather than simply reading off the power or importance 
of cities as some function of population size it is now 
clear that a more accurate and relevant analysis of power 
in a connected age takes account of the nature and extent 
of the connections flowing in and out of cities. Attempts 
to quantify the significance and connectivity of cities in 
the current age have been a major focus of global cities 
research since the mid-1990s. Analysts have employed a 
variety of sources of data including the distribution of 

Chapter 9  Cities: urban worlds    197
and the religious and cultural beliefs of societies. Later 
the emergence of mercantile and subsequently indus-
trial capitalism and processes of colonization became 
both determining influences on the evolving structures 
of cities and systems through which ideas about urban 
form were transmitted around the world. More recently 
many commentators have argued that globalization and 
post-industrial or postmodern capitalism has become the 
dominant influence on urban form across the globe. Some 
have argued that this most recent phase is one of global 
urban convergence where difference between the inter-
nal worlds of cities is being reduced (Plate 9.2), although 
other authors have recorded evidence of diversity as well 
as similarity within postmodern cities (Poulsen et al. 
2002). These forces, certainly since the medieval period, 
have also been mediated through the state, which has 
demonstrated differing degrees of centralization his-
torically and geographically. For example, the cities of 
communist Eastern Europe and China demonstrated a 
exploring the internal structure of cities has tended to be 
characterized by a focus on either the physical morphol-
ogy of cities, their buildings, streets and spaces, or the 
complex and dynamic economic and social geographies 
that overlie this morphology and that are both reflective 
of it and active in its transformation. The two-way rela-
tionship between the city’s physical form and its social 
and economic geographies is one key to understanding 
the nature of cities’ internal worlds. The focus is on the 
former here but with a cautionary note not to attribute 
to it too great a deterministic quality.
While a variety of processes have shaped the geog-
raphies of cities it is possible to recognize some broad 
historical and geographical distinctions within which 
certain processes have been dominant. The very earli-
est cities that appeared in places such as Mesopotamia 
between 5000–6000 BP and later the Indus Valley, Egypt, 
China and the Mediterranean tended to reflect a com-
bination of local physical and environmental conditions 
Spotlight box 9.1
Relational approaches and global cities
Relational approaches have encouraged scholars of 
the city not to regard cities as bounded, isolated entities. 
Rather they have viewed cities as nodes within a variety 
of networks, many of which are global in their extent. 
When thinking about the hinterland of cities, for example, 
relational approaches have not referred to the contiguous 
spaces surrounding cities, as was the case in the earlier 
models of Christaller and von Thünen. Rather they have 
argued that cities’ hinterlands potentially encompass 
spaces that are spatially distant but which are nonethe-
less closely bound together within networks. This has led 
some to question the assumption that we can identify a 
small subset of ‘global’ cities – cities such as New York, 
London and Tokyo commonly painted as the control cen-
tres of the global economy – and to argue that all cities 
are global to a greater or lesser extent (Taylor 2004). 
London may be a more significant node within global net-
works than cities such as Gloucester (England), Oaxaca 
(Mexico) or Hobart (Australia), but these cities are cer-
tainly not, somehow, ‘non-global’ (Hubbard 2006: 185).
Relational approaches represent a fundamental 
rethinking of prevailing conceptions of space. They 
potentially profoundly affect the ways in which we con-
ceive of cities. Ash Amin discusses this in the context of 
the representation of London in maps:
it will take a lot to displace the A–Z or concentric circle 
image of London by a relational map that incorporates 
the network of sites around the world that pump fresh 
food into a distribution centre called Covent Garden, 
that draws neighbourhood boundaries around settle-
ments in postcolonial countries with which social and 
kinship ties remain strong, that makes us see sites 
such as Heathrow airport or Kings Cross station as 
radiations of trails shooting out across the land and far 
beyond.
(Amin 2004: 34; cited in Hubbard 2006: 204)
While many, if not most, cities have hinterlands that 
are potentially global in their extent, there are significant 
differences between the specific connections that flow 
in and out of different cities and hence in the nature of 
these hinterlands. This reminds us that it is important not 
to be seduced by the global rhetoric that infuses much of 
this discourse. It is the materiality of the city, the internal 
mixes of people, firms and institutions and the interac-
tions that take place within cities that affect the ways in 
which cities articulate with the outside world (and visa-
versa of course) (Thrift 1996). The internal worlds of 
different cities are highly diverse and it is important to 
appreciate that this is a component of, and a context 
within which, the geographies of global networks are 
formed.

198    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
distinctive ‘camel-back’ urban form, with a high-density 
centre surrounded respectively by low-density industrial 
and high-density residential zones, a form resulting from 
centralist state-control of land markets and planning and 
not seen in cities of the capitalist world (Pacione 2009: 
184). Further, observable differences between the forms 
of British and American cities during the twentieth cen-
tury were attributed largely to the history of UK gov-
ernment state intervention in the housing market (Mann 
1965; Ward 2004).
Broad categorizations such as these, or typologies that 
suggest distinctive epochs or categories either in the evo-
lution of urban form or in types of cities, are undoubt-
edly helpful in that they begin to work through the 
complexity and variety of cities. However, they do carry 
with them the risk of overemphasizing either the perva-
siveness of processes such as postmodern urbanization, 
or the distinctiveness of urban epochs. For example, the 
extent to which it can be said we are currently witness-
ing a new phase of urbanization producing cities under 
Plate 9.2  Global urban convergence? Auckland, 
New Zealand.
(Mike Deaton)
conditions of postmodern globalization that are distinc-
tively different from those produced under industrial 
capitalism has been the subject of considerable debate 
(Harvey 1989). Similarly, too ready a recourse to models 
of urban form carries with it the risk of masking a patina 
of local distinctiveness in the internal worlds of cities. 
It is important to remember that, eye-catching as the 
epochal processes of urbanization may be, their imprint 
on cities is always uneven and their effects are mediated 
locally. Some cities, perhaps smaller cities in particular 
(Bell and Jayne 2006), might be relatively lightly touched 
by these processes while elsewhere processes of contem-
porary urbanization might be transforming the archi-
tectural landscape of cities while leaving the underlying 
structure or plan relatively unaffected. Cities’ internal 
worlds, then, are often palimpsests within which it is pos-
sible to discern many phases of partial urban transforma-
tions. The universalizing tendencies within urban theory 
and its masking or disregard of urban cosmopolitanism 
has recently been the subject of some significant critiques 
(Hubbard 2006; Robinson 2006).
9.2.4 Postmodern urbanization
The main process of contemporary urbanization that 
has caught the attention of urban theorists is that of 
postmodern urbanization. Some have argued that we are 
witnessing a new phase of postmodern urbanization that 
is producing cities that are distinctly different in their 
form and their social and economic characteristics from 
earlier waves of urban development. This claim actually 
rests on empirical investigation of only a small number 
of cities, of which Los Angeles has assumed a primacy 
(Plate 9.3). A key motif of postmodern urbanization is 
an apparent fragmentation of both urban form and the 
social and economic geographies of the city. The post-
modern city is said to demonstrate a chaotic urban form 
characterized by the juxtaposition of spectacular ‘frag-
ments’ of commercial and residential development and 
redevelopment set within extensive areas of environmen-
tally and economically degraded and ethnically segre-
gated space (Soja 1989, 1996, 2000; Davis 1990; Dear and 
Flusty 1998; Dear 2000). These urban geographies, it has 
been argued, reflect profound changes in the processes 
that shape cities and their urban landscapes. Rather than 
the relatively stable phase of industrial capitalism, medi-
ated by an engaged but not centralized planning system 
in much of the global North during the twentieth cen-
tury, we now have a phase of chaotic capitalism and more 
emasculated planning systems driven primarily by eco-
nomic rather than social imperatives (Hall and Hubbard 
1996, 1998).

Chapter 9  Cities: urban worlds    199
of future urbanization? Although scholars have traced 
the imprint of postmodernity across urban landscapes 
and forms well beyond Los Angeles (Watson and Gib-
son 1995; Poulsen et al. 2002), there has yet to emerge 
Some of the most detailed explorations of the land-
scapes of the postmodern city include Mike Davis’s and 
Ed Soja’s readings of Los Angeles, a city constructed 
within urban theory as the archetypal postmodern 
metropolis (Davis 1995; Scott and Soja 1996). Soja has 
highlighted a number of economic, social and cultural 
processes that have underpinned Los Angeles’ develop-
ment. Economically he cites the growing significance of 
new sectors such as producer services, high-technology, 
cultural entertainment and knowledge-based industries, 
each of which show distinctive clustering patterns around 
which new urban forms have emerged. These develop-
ments have disrupted the more mono-centric, regular 
patterns of urban form characteristic of industrial capi-
talism. Los Angeles is characterized by a number of edge 
city, or post-suburban, developments, such as those spread 
across Orange County, which have emerged around these 
and other new or growing economic sectors. In addition 
the global connectivity of cities discussed above has seen 
Los Angeles’ functions as a key hub, particularly with 
links to the Pacific region, underpin growth through an 
influx of global capital to the city.
Socially Los Angeles has been characterized by height-
ened levels of, particularly ethnic, segregation and polari-
zation and increasing levels of tension and unrest across 
its culturally and economically diverse landscapes. Per-
ceptions of Los Angeles as a dystopian realm, while a 
staple of films such as Bladerunner (1982), Falling Down 
(1993), Escape from LA (1996) and Lakeview Terrace 
(2008), appear to reflect widely held views of the city by 
its residents. Increasingly, residential, leisure and com-
mercial landscapes are characterized by ‘paranoid’ or 
‘carceral’ architecture based on protection, surveillance 
and the exclusion of perceived threats (Plate 9.4). Evi-
dence would suggest that, rather than making residents 
feel safer, such ‘fortress landscapes’ merely exacerbate 
levels of segregation between communities and, because 
they preclude the possibility of cross-cultural mixture and 
dialogue, heighten perceptions of threat associated with 
unknown or demonized urban populations (Sandercock 
2006). A counterpoint to this dystopianism, and perhaps 
a response to it, has been the pervasiveness of fantasy and 
simulation throughout the city’s landscape. Originally 
deriving from the fantasy worlds of expositions, world’s 
fairs and theme parks such as Disneyland (Ley and Olds 
1999), they now permeate the city more widely and are 
found in examples such as themed shopping malls and 
residential districts (Crawford 2004).
While Los Angeles offers a convincing narrative of 
postmodern urban development, the question remains, 
as with all urban models, to what extent does this one 
case represent a more widespread process or a harbinger

wider, with both social and public health implications, 
for example. Levels of poverty and inequality are both an 
issue within cities and between cities and are fundamental 
to many of the problems that they experience.
There are huge global disparities in the equality of 
income distribution between countries. While the aver-
age income of the top 20 per cent in Sierra Leone is 
roughly 58 times greater than that of the bottom 20 per 
cent, in Slovakia this figure is only around four times 
greater (UN Development Programme 2009). Cities tend 
to reflect these national and regional patterns of wealth 
and development but it tends to be within cities that the 
juxtapositions of wealth and poverty are at their most 
intense and visible. The effects of this inequality are 
compounded by the failure of governments in countries 
within which it is at its greatest to intervene effectively 
and to support their poorest residents. Put simply, where 
the wealthiest in a country command so much of the 
money available there is neither sufficient left over to 
support the poorest, nor often the political will, given 
the connections that frequently exist between the eco-
nomic and political elites. This inequality, and the pro-
cesses that underpin it, produce fractured cities that are 
very difficult to plan and manage in any meaningful way. 
They are not good cities.
Manifestations of urban poverty and inequality dif-
fer in the cities of the global North and South. In the 
global South the most archetypal landscapes of poverty 
are the, often extensive and now long-standing, informal 
settlements (shanty towns or favelas) that ring many cit-
ies (Potter and Lloyd-Evans 1998; Davis 2006). These are 
a product of the high levels of rural to urban migration 
and rapid urbanization in these regions and the inability 
of formal housing channels to provide enough affordable 
housing for rapidly urbanizing and largely impoverished 
populations. The provision of basic services such as clean 
water and sanitation are often impossible in these set-
tings. While these are typically portrayed through refer-
ence to poverty and exclusion, some have seen them as 
sites of hope that provide self-help solutions or alterna-
tive futures where the state, the market and international 
development policy are not able to provide adequate 
housing (Keivani and Werna 2001). The modernization 
of some cities such as Dubai has created huge visual con-
trasts within their landscapes between the monuments to 
modernization that have been constructed recently and 
the camps of the construction workers employed to build 
them (Plate 9.5). The persistence of poverty within many 
countries of the global South, alongside the embrace of 
modernization, has produced cities in places such as India 
whose landscapes, and economic and social geographies 
can be read as manifestations of ongoing inequality in 
these countries (see also Case Study 9.1).
a consensus around the extent to which it represents an 
epochal break in the history of urbanization. Tracing 
its imprint across the urban world remains an ongoing 
project for urban geographers. Certainly though, the 
discourse of a uniform postmodernism as an inevitable 
form and type for cities around the world would appear 
to be an oversimplification. There is evidence, for exam-
ple, of significant differences, as well as similarities, 
between postmodern cities (Poulsen et al. 2002), while 
the interactions of postmodernism with post-colonial 
urbanization across the global South are as likely to lead 
to complex patterns of locally mediated outcomes as 
they are to the emergence of a uniform global postmod-
ern ‘blandscape’.
9.3 Contemporary urban issues
The definition and identification of contemporary urban 
issues varies with scale. The example, mentioned at the 
start of this chapter, of the issues highlighted by a local 
newspaper within a single city, points to a range of issues 
that are primarily reflective of the local urban context. 
However, the specific minutiae of these issues should not 
distract us from the fact that they are also reflective of 
more broadly conceived urban concerns. Examples of 
minor incidents of anti-social behaviour are constitu-
tive of broader issues of crime, safety and conflict within 
the city (Valentine 2001). This in turn might speak of 
the relationships between different groups of people, for 
example, distinguished on the basis of age, ethnicity or 
lifestyle. The problems caused by seagulls in the city cen-
tre, for example, speak to broader concerns about the 
relationships between society and nature, the human and 
the non-human, in cities (Wolch 2002; Hinchcliffe 2007) 
and perhaps of cities and sustainability. It is to these 
broadly conceived contemporary urban issues that we 
now turn. Although different authors might highlight dif-
ferent sets of concerns, we wish to highlight three press-
ing issues facing the urban world in the early twenty-first 
century. These are issues of global urban poverty and 
inequality, cultural diversity within cities, and the rela-
tionship between cities and sustainability.
9.3.1 Urban poverty and inequality
There is nothing inherently urban about poverty and ine-
quality (see Chapter 10). However, the urban world is the 
context within which they are seen at their most intense 
and perhaps intractable. While poverty here is understood 
primarily as an economic phenomenon reflecting levels of 
wealth, development and income its impacts are much 

Chapter 9  Cities: urban worlds    201
precarious employment and restricted mobility. Cer-
tainly the majority would resist having the underclass 
tag attached to describe themselves and their experiences.
However they may be manifest, poverty and inequality 
remain some of the most significant and long-standing 
urban issues. Indeed, many commentators argue that 
poverty and inequality are increasing as a result of the 
adoption of a range of neoliberal urban policies in cit-
ies around the world (Cochrane 2007), which have seen 
reductions in state support for local populations in the 
form of cuts to welfare services, and which it is argued 
have intensified following the Wall Street Crash of 2008 
as part of a politics of ‘austerity urbanism’ (Peck 2012).
9.3.2 Cultural diversity in cities
The sociologist Sharon Zukin has argued that urban 
‘publics have become more mobile and diverse’ (Zukin 
1995: 3). This has resulted in increasing levels of cultural 
diversity becoming a defining characteristic of contempo-
rary cities. Leonie Sandercock coined the phrase ‘mongrel 
cities’ to describe cities in which ‘difference, otherness, 
multiplicity, heterogeneity, diversity and plurality prevail’ 
(2006: 38). This brings with it the potential for innova-
tion, mixing, intercultural dialogue and the emergence 
of new, hybrid cultural forms. However, it can also pose 
challenges and give rise to more negative outcomes. 
Sandercock’s work starts from the premise that mongrel 
cities are an undeniable reality and that it is an obliga-
tion of both the city-building professionals and citizens 
to respond to the challenges those cities present.
Many myths and images of multicultural cities are pro-
moted through the marketing campaigns of cities keen to 
stress the contributions of different groups to their public 
cultures. By contrast, Richard Sennett (1994) has argued 
that mongrel cities tend to lack civic culture (Plate 9.6). 
He argues that these cities are overwhelmingly character-
ized by tolerance, rather than hostility, between different 
cultural groups. However, this is a tolerance characterized 
by indifference towards other cultural groups rather than 
an active engagement with diversity. It constitutes a form 
of indifference across which very little inter-cultural dia-
logue takes place and a form of stasis in which cultural 
groups are predominantly inward looking. The result is 
that little common ground emerges between groups, few 
meaningful cross-cultural institutions develop and little 
cross-cultural political capacity emerges through which 
cities can be shaped in desirable ways. The challenge of 
cultural diversity in cities, then, is how to develop this 
missing engagement and solidarity between different 
cultural groups (Calhoun 2002: 108; cited in Sandercock 
2006: 39). Sandercock, drawing on the work of Sennett, 
argues that this involves ‘the challenge of living together 
In the global North, postmodern urbanization has 
been interpreted by many as an urbanization of inequal-
ity. The commentaries on Los Angeles discussed above, 
for example, all highlight the juxtapositions of spectac-
ular wealth and grinding poverty found within it. Ine-
quality lies at the heart of the fear that has been said to 
permeate residents of postmodern cities which has seen 
them retreat behind gated communities and appar-
ently become so reliant on other fortress landscapes. Of 
widespread concern within debates about contemporary 
urbanism has been the apparent emergence of an interna-
tional urban underclass, not only in postmodern cities 
but also those associated with high levels of immigra-
tion and deindustrialization, who have become cut off 
from routes into the formal economy and who have as 
a consequence turned to precarious informal and illegal 
economies, most notably drug dealing, as rational-choice 
alternatives. The appeal to such evocative labels, which 
bear the weight of hundreds of years of demonizing the 
urban poor, carries with it the danger of universalizing 
conditions that might be particular to only some cities. 
While groups whose poverty is long-standing and whose 
ties to the formal economy have been effectively sev-
ered do exist, their experience is not typical of all of the 
urban poor. Poverty for the majority in the global North 
is much more mundane than evocations of the underclass 
would suggest, and involves struggles to make ends meet 
and struggles over inadequate housing, healthy food,

which cultural differences can be bridged around a recog-
nition of shared interests, presences and common goals.
Whilst keen not to idealize these micro-publics, Amin 
recognizes that inter-cultural dialogues will not just hap-
pen in these spaces. Indeed within many existing micro-
publics such dialogues are not typical. Rather these 
potentials are something that often need to be shaped 
and fostered. It is easy to be sceptical of the potentials 
of micro-publics in this regard. Multiculturalism is not 
necessarily a characteristic of many sports clubs, for 
example. It is common in many cities globally to see 
sport organized formally or informally, to some extent, 
along ethnic and national lines, as with the case of soccer 
associations for Latin Americans in US cities (Hamilton 
and Chincilla 2001: 169) and Asian cricket teams and 
leagues running in parallel to the official league structure 
in British cities such as London and Birmingham (Dutta 
2014). This is not to say that there is no integration of 
these communities within mainstream leagues and teams, 
rather that they are formed as a result of perceptions by 
some players of exclusion from mainstream clubs, along 
with the costs of membership. They may also serve as 
ways of fostering social contact and cultural and national 
solidarity amongst members. However, given the failure 
of conventional policy routes towards multiculturalism 
these settings offer potential alternatives through which 
to incubate future policy. It would be naïve, though, to 
pretend that they are any more immune to the politics 
of indifference, hostility and nationalism than any of the 
city’s other spaces and settings. The challenge, then, is 
both how desirable dialogues and encounters might be 
not simply in tolerant indifference to each other, but in 
active engagement’ (Sandercock 2006: 40).
Leonie Sandercock, in reviewing the work of social 
theorists in this area, highlights the contributions of 
the geographer Ash Amin in seeking to explore routes 
to more convivial futures for mongrel cities (2002). 
Amin is particularly critical of several popular policy 
approaches to developing multiculturalism. Many of 
these are design-led and revolve around the supposed 
potentials of the public realm as a resource, shared 
between cultural groups, through which, with appro-
priate design, inter-cultural encounter can be fostered 
(Rogers 1999). Sandercock though, drawing on Amin’s 
findings, offers a sceptical assessment of the utopian 
potentials of public space.
The depressing reality, Amin counters, is that far from 
being spaces where diversity is being negotiated, these 
spaces tend either to be territorialized by particular 
groups (whites, youths, skateboarders, Asian families) 
or they are spaces of transit, with very little contact 
between strangers.
(Sandercock 2006: 44)
Rather than pursuing conventional design-led policies, 
Amin argued for an alternative focus on the potentials of 
‘micro-publics’, spaces such as workplaces, schools, com-
munity centres and sports clubs that provide contexts in 
which inter-cultural dialogues, although often mundane 
or ‘prosaic negotiations’ (Sandercock 2006: 44), can take 
place. Micro-publics, Amin argues, offer contexts within

encompassed many dimensions including consumption 
patterns and resource use amongst urban populations 
(Rees and Wackernagel 2008), sustainable urban size and 
form (Breheny 1995), the roles of neighbourhoods and 
green spaces in promoting sustainable development (Car-
ley 1999; Chiesura 2003), transport and mobility (Hall 
2003) and encounters with nature in the city (Hinchliffe 
et al. 2005; Benton-Short and Short 2008). Just as many 
sub-disciplines of human geography have been reshaped 
as they have undergone a cultural turn in recent years, it is 
increasingly likely that urban geography will be reshaped 
as it undergoes an ecological turn in the near future. The 
imperatives for this could not be greater. Atkinson, in a 
series of essays (2007a, 2007b, 2008), argues that the cur-
rent crisis will lead to no less than the collapse of modern 
civilization as we now know it. Ultimately, he predicts:
It is not at all clear how fast and through what stages 
the collapse will unfold because there are many vari-
ables which will interact differentially and depend cru-
cially on political decisions taken – and possibly major 
conflicts – along the way; however, we can be sure that 
in general the decline will be inexorable. By the lat-
ter decades of this century, a radically altered world 
will have emerged, with a greatly reduced population 
living surrounded by the defunct debris of moder-
nity, comprised of fragmented and largely self-reliant 
political entities. Our complex, ‘globalized’ world 
of megastates and technological hubris will be but a 
fading memory. The impacts of global warming and 
other environmental legacies of our age will reduce 
the options for reconstruction, possibly fatally.
(Atkinson 2008: 79)
The challenge facing urban dwellers, urban managers 
and urban geographers in the future is to try to ensure 
that Atkinson’s and other gloomy prognoses for the 
future of the urban world are not realized.
9.4 Conclusion
The urban world, as we have seen, is big, dynamic, diverse 
and complex: a potentially intimidating topic of study. 
However, it is also a fascinating, rewarding and impor-
tant topic for which there are economic, social and eco-
logical imperatives that demand it is better understood 
and managed.
This chapter has attempted to provide a broad frame-
work through which to approach cities. This involves, at 
its heart, the resolution of the small and immediate con-
cerns of the urban here and now with the broader trends, 
patterns and issues of which they are part.
fostered within these micro-publics, and how they might 
feed into macro-public civic and political movements 
shaping more convivial futures in mongrel cities.
9.3.3 Cities, sustainability and resilience
The ecological crises of the current age are well known. 
They are discussed elsewhere in this volume in some 
detail (Chapters 5, 6 and 7). The challenges posed by 
dwindling global supplies of accessible oil and climatic 
chaos are global in their extent and fundamental in their 
significance to the planet (Atkinson 2007a, 2007b, 2008; 
Newman et al. 2009). The relationships between cities 
and these ongoing crises are becoming an ever greater 
concern of urban scholars, as witnessed by the growth 
of literature on cities and sustainability since early key 
publications from the mid 1990s (Haughton and Hunter 
1994). Concern here is two-way involving both the ways 
in which cities pose a threat to the environment and the 
ways in which the environment poses a threat to cities. 
The latter is evidenced by the recent growth in the urban 
resilience literature (Coafee et al. 2009; Newman et al. 
2009). The former concern involves both the mapping of 
the contributions of cities to these crises and outlining 
possible solutions to them while the latter is concerned 
primarily with the ways in which cities might build 
resilience to crisis into their infrastructures and social 
and economic structures and practices. There is over-
lap between these literatures as the latter is concerned 
both with reactive measures to mitigate the impacts 
of crises but also the development of long-term prac-
tices and processes that may contribute to the resolu-
tion of ecological crises, or at least their reduction and 
management.
Without doubt, given that over half of the world’s 
population now lives in cities, the rates of future growth 
of the world’s urban population and the ecological 
demands made by cities and their populations, the urban 
world will be the key site across which the impacts of 
these ecological crises are felt and the key site in any 
possible resolution of them. It should be remembered 
that when scholars of the city discuss sustainability, 
crisis and resilience, their discussions are not restricted 
to matters of environmental science. Human geogra-
phers have key contributions to make to these debates, 
since inequality as highlighted above, for example, is 
an inherently unsustainable condition. It compromises 
resilience as the impacts of ecological crises are felt une-
venly across social groups, the poor being less able to 
insulate themselves from them. Further, it undermines 
attempts at collective solutions to ongoing problems of 
environment and sustainability. The debates around the 
relationships between cities and ecological crises have 

204    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
Urban geography and urban geographers at all levels 
have important contributions to make to the future reso-
lution of the urban issues identified at the end of this 
chapter and many more besides. The twenty-first century 
will certainly be an urban century, but how urban systems 
and cities will change, and what these will look like at 
the end of the century, will continue to pose intriguing 
questions for urban geographers to address.
Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter, you should be able to:
● Appreciate the nature and diversity of the urban 
world. You should be able to recognize the char-
acteristics of cities, the nature of urbanization, 
the diversity of global urban forms and their 
characteristics.
● Recognize the difficulties inherent in trying to define 
and represent the urban, either within scholarly 
­discourses or through systems of administration, 
planning and management.
● Think geographically about cities as socio-spatial 
entities. Cities are the products of social relations. 
This is reflected both in the relationships within 
­cities, for example between different groups of 
­people, and between cities. Understanding the 
nature and effects of these relationships is an 
important aspect of differentiating cities.
● Appreciate the range of issues that face cities 
in the present era and the ways in which these 
can vary between different parts of the world and 
between different types of city. In addition it is 
important to critically evaluate the different routes 
to the resolution of these problems that have been 
advocated.
● Understand the different ways in which cities have 
been conceptualized in geographical and socio-
logical thought. Scholars of cities have developed 
many different takes on the city, approaching it from 
different angles and studying different aspects of it. 
Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of these 
different approaches is a key skill for the urban 
geographer.

Chapter 10  Urban segregation and social inequality     207
A
ll societies are riddled by inequalities, some of 
which are more fundamental than others (for 
example, a person’s skin colour, age, or religion typi-
cally plays a critical role in shaping their status in con-
temporary society, whereas their hair colour or shoe 
size tends to be less significant). Quite why some social 
differences matter more than others is a key debate in 
the social sciences – one to which geographers have 
contributed in a variety of ways. One contribution 
involves forms of ‘mapping’ that show that different 
social groups are differently distributed in space. Such 
mappings typically demonstrate that particular social 
groups, defined by age, sexuality, class, gender, reli-
gion or ethnicity, dominate in particular areas, often to 
the exclusion of other groups. Arguably, such mapping 
of social space began not in geography, but sociology, 
with members of the Chicago School of Sociology 
including Ernest Burgess and Robert Park in the 1920s. 
Burgess in particular was a keen proponent of map-
ping and expected his students to become proficient in 
mapping, and able to combine their own observations 
on the quality of different residential neighbourhoods 
with extensive use of Census and other sources.
The most famous outcome of this type of social map-
ping was the concentric zone model of Chicago that rep-
resented the city as a set of successive zones typified by 
rising wealth and prosperity as distance from the centre 
or CBD increased. Over subsequent years, geographers 
have developed this initial model to provide other sche-
matic mappings of the city showing its divisions into dis-
tinctive social spaces or neighbourhoods. And though the 
rigid divisions of the industrial city have given way to a 
more complex post-industrial geography (see Chapter 9), 
it is clear that the city remains a far from undifferentiated 
social space: rather, it is a complex ‘patchwork’ in which 
different social groups take their allotted place. Many 
neighbourhoods and streets are of course mixed and, 
conversely, few residential streets or neighbourhoods are 
homogeneous in their social make-up. This said, there 
appears to be strong tendencies towards clustering, seg-
regation and socio-spatial sorting, meaning we can still 
associate specific neighbourhoods with specific types of 
residents, whether classified by class, age, ethnicity, sexu-
ality, religion, gender, disability and so on. The underly-
ing logic is simple: those with privileged social identities 
tend to be found in more valued locations (something 
reflected in the property prices in different areas. While 
geographers now deploy different theories to explain 
this patterning than was the case in the time of Burgess, 
the same type of conclusions about the city as a ‘sorting 
machine’ can be drawn. If anything, these tendencies are 
becoming more clear-cut over time: in the UK, for exam-
ple, it is now easier to typify some inner urban areas as 
non-white than any time in the recent past, despite gen-
eral evidence that the nation is becoming more ‘multicul-
tural’ (Sturgis et al. 2014; Johnston et al. 2015).
Through such mappings of the city, geographers have 
demonstrated that the city continues to be divided on 
social lines. As we will see in this chapter, however, this is 
merely a starting point for urban social geography, that 
part of the discipline most preoccupied with identifying 
patterns of segregation and documenting their conse-
quence for different groups. This chapter explores some 
of the key concepts in this sub-discipline, particularly 
those revolving around segregation and exclusion. Rather 
than focusing solely on the idea that neighbourhoods are 
formed via the clustering of like-minded individuals who 
want to live alongside one another, it explores the ways 
that segregation creates clusters or areas associated with 
social stigma and disadvantage, and proposes that this is, 
in part, a sign that some groups do not want to live along-
side social groups who they identify as Other or inferior 
in some way. As this chapter will demonstrate, one of 
the clearest ways that the social disadvantage of such 
neighbourhoods is expressed is through their labelling as 
being ‘on the margins’ – e.g. ‘slums’, ‘problem estates’ or 
‘ghettos’. For those who do not live in such spaces, these 
areas can often be spaces of fear and fascination because 
they represent spatial concentrations of those who fail to 
match mainstream ideas of how people should live and 
work. The stigma surrounding these places compounds 
their poverty and isolation, as once a place is labelled as 
degraded and deprived, its residents may find it hard to 
be accepted by mainstream society. Underlining the fact 
that space plays an active role in shaping people’s stand-
ard of living, this chapter’s focus on urban geographies 
of segregation and exclusion demonstrates why a sensi-
tivity to place matters, and illustrates some of the ways 
urban social geographers contribute to pressing debates 
on social inequality.
10.1 Poverty and urban segregation
While geography has always had a strong interest in 
mapping social groups and their location in space, for 
many urban social geographers this is a means to an end: 
namely, highlighting the importance of spatial processes 
in perpetuating social inequality. Urban social geography 
hence circles around questions of the quality of life that 
people experience in different spaces. In simple terms, 
quality of life can be defined as the extent to which 
our needs and desires (be they social, psychological or 
physiological) are fulfilled. Though this can only truly be 
measured through subjective assessments of the extent to 

208    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
terms of goods, services and the necessities of life. Con-
sequently, recent attempts to measure poverty have gen-
erally defined people as being in poverty if they lack the 
financial resources needed to obtain the living conditions 
that are customary and ‘normal’ in the society to which 
they belong. Identifying such thresholds does not suggest 
that everyone’s needs are the same, but does suggest an 
income level that is socially unacceptable for any indi-
vidual to live below. For example, the Poverty and Social 
Exclusion project suggested that 33  per cent of the Brit-
ish population were living in poverty in 2012 on the basis 
that their income would not secure at least three of the 
35 items considered by at least 50 per cent of the Brit-
ish population as necessary for maintaining an accept-
able standard of living (see Table 10.1). While some of 
these items may not have been considered a necessity 
in previous decades (and others remain luxuries that 
many in the global South can only dream of), compari-
son of these figures with previous studies suggests the 
incidence of poverty has actually risen sharply. In 1983,  
14 per cent of British households lacked three or more 
necessities because they could not afford them, a figure 
that increased to 21 per cent in 1990, 26 per cent in 1999 
before accounting for a third of the population in 2013 
(see Pantazis et al. 2006; Gordon et al. 2013).
Increases in costs of living clearly have an impact 
here, with decreases in poverty in the early 2000s seen to 
be reversing in more recent years as disposable incomes 
failed to keep pace with rises in fuel costs, food costs and 
(especially) housing costs. In 2010, the required income 
for a single person of working age to be able to afford a 
minimum standard of living was suggested to be around 
£16,200 per annum, rising to £40,400 for a couple with 
two dependent children (Davis et al. 2014). Roughly trans-
lated, such figures suggest that nearly 14 million people 
in the UK cannot afford what are considered acceptable 
standards of living. While such deprivation is particularly 
pronounced among those who are out of work, many of 
those in the lower strata of the labour market are also 
living in poverty (the persistence of low-paid, part-time 
or precarious forms of employment being significant 
here, alongside the restructuring of welfare provision for 
those on low incomes). Coupled with the rapidly rising 
incomes characteristic of managerial and professional 
occupations (particularly in ‘knowledge-rich’ sectors 
such as law and finance), the consequence is an increas-
ingly polarized society. For example, between 1979 and 
1991, the average British income grew by 36 per cent, 
yet for the bottom tenth of the population it dropped by 
14 per cent. While the rate of income polarization slowed 
in the 1990s – partly because of welfare reform – the gap 
between the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’ accelerated in the 
twenty-first century (Dorling and Rees 2003, 2004). By 
which individuals are satisfied with their own life, many 
studies by geographers have reached consensus that it 
is easier to attain an acceptable or good quality of life 
in areas that offer ample economic opportunities, good 
social facilities, and a quality environment. Given this, 
we can see that our life chances are closely related to our 
place of residence. One well-known aspect of this is the 
so-called ‘postcode lottery’ around health services in the 
UK: depending on where you live, you will enjoy very 
different levels of medical provision through the National 
Health Service (White et al. 2012). Likewise, in the USA 
there are known patterns of health provisioning which 
mean that poorer people live in areas where health risks 
are highest and access to good health services lowest 
(Kwan 2013). Where you are born, and where you live, 
thus has a major bearing on where (and how) you die.
The same is true of prosperity (or lack of it). Geo-
graphical studies of wealth and income suggest that we 
should not just think about neighbourhoods with con-
centrations of rich people, but should recognize the exist-
ence of rich neighbourhoods. This distinction is subtle 
but significant, for it suggests that wealth is amplified 
in some places. To elaborate: people who are born in 
places characterized by high concentrations of afflu-
ence are more likely to be wealthy themselves because 
the concentration of money in the area means standards 
of education, health care and employment are relatively 
good. While house prices are high, housing standards 
are good, and may be an important source of inherited 
wealth. As Dorling (2004) explains, there is a circularity 
here whereby affluence breeds affluence.
Surprisingly, geographers have said little about urban 
geographies of affluence, despite the obvious relation-
ship that exists between income and quality of life (Bea-
verstock et al. 2004; Hay and Muller 2012). In contrast, 
much has been said about geographies of poverty, with 
social geographers often drawn towards this topic because 
they feel their relatively privileged position might allow 
them to draw attention to – and perhaps improve – the life 
chances of those living in poorer urban areas. Poverty can 
be defined as the condition where individuals or house-
holds are unable to afford what might be perceived to be 
the normal necessities of life. Inevitably, judgments of 
what we need to consume to survive vary across time and 
space, meaning geographers are generally more interested 
in relative rather than absolute poverty. On a worldwide 
scale, for example, it is evident that indicators such as 
average income per capita provide only a very superficial 
insight into experiences of poverty in different nation-
states (see Chapter 8). Relative income measures – e.g. 
the definition of poverty as being 60 per cent of median 
equivalent income – are somewhat more meaningful, but 
fail to take into account what that income can secure in

Table 10.1  Perception of adult necessities and how many people lack them (all figures show % of UK adult 
population)
2010/11, the average income of the top fifth of house-
holds was around 15 times greater than for those in the 
bottom fifth (£73,800 per year compared with £5,000) 
(see Figure 10.1) and most measures of income inequality 
suggest the UK is more unequal than at any previous time 
in the last 30 years.
While some nations do not exhibit the levels of social 
polarization apparent in the UK, it is important to note 
that levels of social inequality evident in many other 
nations are far in excess of this (see Spicker 2006). Yet 
in each and every case this social inequality is spatially 
expressed, whether as a division between rich and poor 
regions, an urban–rural divide or differences in wealth 
between cities. However, it is clear that the sharpest con-
trasts between wealth and poverty are found within cities, 
and one of the major contributions urban social geog-
raphers have made to debates surrounding poverty is to 
draw attention to areas of acute urban need. According to 
the United Nations (2001), over one billion of the world’s 
population lives in ‘slum’ urban environments without 
access to safe water, acceptable sanitation and secure, ten-
ured housing of an acceptable standard. Ninety-five per 

210    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
2010, more than half of those living in the socially rented 
housing typical of such estates had less than 60 per cent 
of median income, and could thus be defined as living in 
poverty (Department of Work and Pensions 2011).
The particular combination of problems encoun-
tered in deprived local authority estates created national 
headlines in the 1990s as confrontations between police 
and local youths (especially joyriders accused of stealing 
cars) escalated into fully fledged riots. The spatial con-
centration of unemployment on these estates, especially 
among young men, was hypothesized as the most impor-
tant underlying cause of these disturbances. Figures for 
the 13 estates affected by serious disorder between 1991 
and 1992 suggest that nearly 80 per cent of their occu-
pants were either economically inactive or unemployed 
(Table 10.2). A simultaneous withdrawal of economic 
infrastructure – including businesses, shops and banks 
(Case study 10.1) – meant that there was little money 
circulating locally, and this had negative impacts on men-
tal and physical health. The mythical black market (an 
informal economy based on petty theft, drug dealing or 
cash-in-hand trading) did not offer any sort of escape for 
the majority of residents, given that black markets rarely 
flourish when there are few people who can afford to buy 
stolen goods, let alone legitimate ones (Green 1997).
While geographers stressed that uncivil urban actions 
are also connected to processes of economic restructuring 
and institutional disinvestment, the media largely ignored 
such arguments in favour of a rhetoric depicting Britain’s 
local authority and social housing estates as breeding 
grounds of immorality, characterized by high rates of 
cent of these concentrated slum environments are found 
in the ‘Third World’, and it has accordingly become some-
thing of a geographical cliché to juxtapose the assuredly 
affluent ‘Westernized’ city centres now typical of many 
of the world’s rapidly expanding cities with the ‘slum’ 
dwellings that are often just a stone’s throw away. For 
instance, profiling Jakarta in Indonesia (population 9 
million), Cybriwsky and Ford (2001) contrast the city’s 
Golden Triangle of prestigious residential districts (e.g. 
Cikini, Kuningan and Menteng) with the rumah liar (‘wild 
houses’) characteristic of its sprawling, chaotic kampungs. 
They thus conclude that Jakarta ‘has extraordinary con-
trasts between the worlds of prosperity and poverty, and 
significant challenges ahead for continued development as 
a global metropolis’ (Cybriwsky and Ford 2001: 209).
Yet such ‘extraordinary’ contrasts between landscapes 
of wealth and poverty are not just restricted to megacities 
or those cities living with the legacy of colonial rule: for 
example, while London remains the most deeply divided 
city in Britain in terms of income disparities, most British 
cities display obvious contrasts between the affluent land-
scapes of the central city and the ‘pockets’ of deprivation 
that surround it. Notable here are those areas of 1960s 
local authority housing, which came to be characterized 
by high rates of economic inactivity. While these are not 
‘slums’ according to the UN’s definitions, evidence from 
20 of these ‘unpopular’ housing estates in the 1990s sug-
gested they possessed unemployment rates, on average, 
two and a half times higher than the surrounding urban 
area (Power and Tunstall 1997), representing pernicious 
spatial concentrations of relative poverty (Table 10.2). In

Case study 10.1 
Geographies of retail disinvestment
During the late 1990s, debates on poverty began to 
focus on the role institutional disinvestment played in 
exacerbating the problems encountered by those living 
in ‘poor places’. One dimension of this was the with-
drawal of financial services from poorer areas, with as 
many as 15 per cent of bank branches in the United 
Kingdom closed down in the early 1990s, the major-
ity in low-income, inner-city areas (Leyshon and Thrift 
1994). Another was the closure of once-vibrant neigh-
bourhood shops as retail chains concentrated on the 
development of large superstores catering to mobile 
and affluent consumers (Williams and Hubbard 2001). 
Given that many of these were located in out-of-town 
and edge-of-town locations, this left many neighbour-
hoods described as food ‘deserts’, where a range of 
affordable and varied food was available only to those 
who had private transport:
Food deserts . . . are those areas of cities where 
cheap, nutritious food is virtually unobtainable. Car-
less residents, unable to reach out-of-town supermar-
kets, depend on the corner shop where prices are high, 
products are processed and fresh fruit and vegetables 
are poor or non-existent.
(Laurence 1997)
This has raised serious concerns about the health of 
those in poor places, with the lack of fresh fruit and veg-
etables and a reliance on fatty, fast foods implicated in 
the making of significant health inequalities. Confirming 
the intensity of food-access problems in some of the large 
local authority housing estates in British cities, Wrigley et 
al. (2003) noted significant improvements in diet follow-
ing the construction of a new superstore in the Seacroft 
district of Leeds, an area that had previously suffered con-
siderable retail disinvestment. Against this, there remains 
a noted correlation between deprivation and the quality 
of local high streets in Britain, with the Royal Society for 
Public Health (2015) suggesting ‘unhealthy’ high streets 
remain typified by bookmakers, payday loan shops, fast 
food outlets and tanning salons, whereas pharmacies, lei-
sure centres, and health services are found on the healthi-
est and wealthiest High Streets, often alongside a diverse 
range of independent food retailers (see also Maguire et 
al. 2015; Cox et al. 2010).
teenage pregnancy, widespread drug abuse, alcoholism 
and antisocial behaviour:
The sense of decline and neglect in many of these 
areas is palpable: the built environment in many of 
these areas has now taken on all the classic, ominous 
characteristics (boarded-up windows, barbed wire 
surrounds) of the enclaves of high crime and violence 
associated with Los Angeles and its ghettos in the 
months leading up to the 1992 riots. Public space is 
often colonized by young men in baseball caps and 
cheap khaki.

and market, blighted by a debilitating cycle of labelling 
and marginalization. An example here is provided by the 
banlieues (suburbs) of social housing surrounding Paris 
and other major French cities. In October 2005, three 
young men in one of these banlieues – Clichy-sous-Bois 
(NE Paris) – sought to evade a police check (a regular 
occurrence in the banlieues) by hiding in an electricity 
substation. Two were electrocuted, prompting an anti-
police protest that rapidly spread across the country. In 
over a week of riots, 10,000 cars were torched and 3,000 
people arrested. Video footage of burning cars was 
screened nightly by the world’s media, prompting com-
mentators to speculate why such scenes were happening. 
Whilst some sections of the press suggested these were 
simply copycat protests in which young men wanted to 
appear on television, more trenchant critiques suggested 
that at their source were structural inequalities that 
needed to be understood in geographical and histori-
cal context. For, as Dikeç (2006) argues, the banlieues 
are not all deprived (and some are reasonably affluent). 
Yet they have always had negative connotations, identi-
fied as ‘les quartiers difficiles’ which contain the social 
problems that have, by and large, been cast out of the 
central city. At the turn of the millennium, these areas 
of social housing possessed unemployment rates twice 
the national average, with 40 per cent of young people 
unemployed. The fact that some of these areas of social 
housing were explicitly designed to house North African 
immigrants in the 1960s is also highly significant here, 
given that the banlieue has always been understood as 
a ‘problem area’ (i.e. designed to solve the problem of 
housing new migrant labour).
Writing before the riots, Tissot and Poupeau (2005: 
5) argued that ‘when one talks of poverty in France, one 
can talk of the “socially excluded”, the “immigrants”, 
or even of “the young”, but it is easier for reports to 
dwell on the places where it is found: “les banlieues”’. 
Post-millennium, and in a context of considerable 
Islamaphobia in the West, the problem of the banlieue 
was transformed from one where inhabitants of the ban-
lieue were a problem for one another to one where they 
were imagined as threat to the city (and the nation) as 
a whole. By way of example, Garbin and Millington 
(2012: 2071) argue that stigma and shame were attached 
to La Courneuve’s Citédes 4000 zone that excluded the 
mainly North African inhabitants from the ‘Republican 
project’ in a symbolic defamation that chained residents 
to this specific space, and denied them wider participa-
tion in society. As they write, ‘relegated spaces such as 
La Courneuve enclose individuals and families already 
deprived of capital and exacerbate their exclusion by 
reducing the likelihood that they may gain access to 
capital in the future’.
While there were as many as 2,000 local authority 
housing estates in Britain, accounting for nearly two 
million people in total (Goodwin 1995), the term ‘no-go’ 
estate became a convenient way for the media and public 
alike to label a wide variety of social environments in the 
1990s (even though only a small number of which experi-
enced unrest). Such labelling exacerbated neighbourhood 
decline: those who could, moved out, leaving behind only 
the most vulnerable (Hastings and Dean 2003). In the 
words of Hanley (2011), many large estates appeared 
‘ringed by an invisible forcefield that asks outsiders why 
they might want to enter, and insiders why they might 
want to leave’.
Such factors also appeared to be present in the ‘Eng-
lish Riots’ of 2011, which involved several nights of loot-
ing and public disorder in the largest cities. Although 
politicians were quick to denounce the riots as the work 
of ‘feral’ gangs, and argued for a swift law and order 
response to quell an ‘epidemic’ of criminality, other com-
mentators drew attention to the inequalities between 
those living in the poorer areas of cities and the grow-
ing affluence of the richest. Dorling and Lee (2014), for 
example, describe the disturbances as both symptomatic 
of a divided nation, but more specifically of dividing 
cities. In their analysis they quote Ministry of Justice 
data to conclude that 41 per cent of suspects lived in the 
10 per cent most deprived places in England and that the 
majority of areas where suspects lived were categorized 
as deprived, with 66 per cent of those areas becoming 
poorer between 2007 and 2010. For esteemed social theo-
rist, Zygmunt Bauman (2011, np) these riots were seen 
to be the outcome of the combination of rising consum-
erism and rising inequality. As he put it, ‘this was not a 
rebellion or an uprising of famished and impoverished 
people or an oppressed ethnic or religious minority – but 
a mutiny of defective and disqualified consumers, peo-
ple offended and humiliated by the display of riches to 
which they had been denied access . . . city riots in Britain 
are best understood as a revolt of frustrated consumers’ 
(Bauman 2011). The implication here is that the paral-
lel lives led by residents living in different areas of the  
city – some privileged, others associated with an ‘under-
class’ – resulted in a moment of collapse when those liv-
ing in deprived areas, often adjacent to areas of wealth, 
seized the consumer goods they felt they were denied by 
the accident of geography.
As we will subsequently see, in recent times Brit-
ish local authority estates have been subject to forms 
of regeneration that mean that the overt concentration 
of poverty in such neighbourhoods is being mitigated 
by processes where more affluent residents are encour-
aged to move in. However, in other instances, ‘problem’ 
estates appear to have been abandoned by both state

society that has not made distinctions between the social 
mainstream (or norm) and those Others who seemingly 
threaten the coherence of society. The notion of a scape-
goat is certainly an ancient one, and history can tell of 
many groups – e.g. Jews, prostitutes, homosexuals – whose 
lives have been made intolerable because they are seen to 
pollute the body politic (Sennett 1994). Such groups have 
often been cast out, physically, as well as metaphorically, 
socially excluded on the basis that they disturb social and 
spatial order. In situations where they have been allowed to 
remain, their occupation of space has often been fiercely 
contested: in many contexts, the socially excluded have 
been unable or unwilling to occupy the spaces associated 
with mainstream society, carving out their own geogra-
phies on the margins.
Writing in the context of the urban West, Winchester 
and White (1988) suggest that socially excluded groups 
include the unemployed, the impoverished elderly, lone-
parent families, ethnic minorities, refugees and asylum 
seekers, the disabled, illegal immigrants, the homeless, 
sexual minorities, prostitutes, criminals, drug users and 
students. If you are reading this book, the chances are 
that you are a student. If so, the identification of stu-
dents as an excluded group may be causing you some 
puzzlement. Even though some students are highly 
indebted, may come from poor backgrounds or have to 
take part-time jobs to fund their (supposedly) full-time 
studies, few live in the conditions of poverty described 
above. In fact, in the UK the average student is from the 
South-east (the most affluent part of the United King-
dom) and has parents who are part of the professional 
or managerial class (Dorling 2004). This means most 
students are able to afford most of the adult necessities 
The connections made here between ethnicity and 
space are significant, and we will return to these subse-
quently. At this point, it suffices to say that the white-
dominated media in France could not accept that the 
protest was one in which French citizens were justifiably 
declaring their anger at the deteriorating housing, lack 
of transport and poor schooling that characterized their 
banlieue. Rather, this was depicted as a riot in which 
‘outsiders’ from the colonial margins sought to attack 
the centre (Dikeç 2006). Such arguments support Shields’ 
(1991: 5) view that marginal places ‘carry the image and 
stigma of their marginality which becomes indistinguish-
able from any empirical identity they might have had’. In 
this sense, it is clear that media stereotypes play a cru-
cial role in creating and perpetuating social and spatial 
inequalities.
10.2 Urban segregation and  
cultural stereotypes
The fact that the media exacerbated the deprivation expe-
rienced in the banlieue and outer city estates by drawing 
broad-brushed stereotypes of place suggests that when we 
explore social inequality, we need to think carefully about 
the way representations of people and place entwine. This 
involves consideration of cultural issues (see Chapter 13), 
and shifts attention from the economic manifestations of 
inequality to questions of why some groups become iden-
tified as threats or problems for mainstream society. No 
matter how widespread the rhetoric that we are all cre-
ated equal has been, historically it is difficult to identify a

parts of the town or city where you study where you are 
told students are not welcome and where you may have 
felt ‘out of place’. For example, some pubs or clubs let 
students know, in subtle or not-so-subtle ways, that they 
are not welcome. You may even know of instances where 
students have been verbally abused (or even attacked) just 
for being students. Thankfully, such instances are rare. In 
contrast, opposition to studentification – the increased 
student occupation of the local housing market – is 
becoming very common. This phenomenon is mainly 
limited to university towns in the UK where on-campus 
accommodation is not sufficient to house burgeoning 
numbers of students and where particular areas become 
associated with high levels of rental accommodation tar-
geting students (Smith and Holt 2007). Though student 
occupation can increase house prices (with the buy-to-let 
market proving extremely lucrative), student housing is 
often opposed by long-term residents who blame it for 
neighbourhood decline. In some areas, the consequences 
of studentification have been reported to be nothing 
short of catastrophic, with lobby groups arguing for 
stronger controls on the licensing of student housing to 
prevent neighbourhoods becoming ‘over-run’ by young, 
transient populations, displacing longer-term residents 
(UK Universities 2005). Highly dramatized media sto-
ries evoke the environmental and social transformation 
occurring in districts undergoing student expansion, 
illustrated with images of overgrown gardens, rubbish 
left out and sheets used as makeshift curtains. Addition-
ally, campaign groups opposing student occupation allege 
students cause noise and nuisance, displace local long-
term residents and fail to contribute to community life 
(Hubbard 2008, 2009).
identified in Table 10.1 (and even when they are unable, 
they may be assisted through hardship grants or student 
loans). Some now live in privately managed halls boast-
ing state-of-the art wifi, plasma TVs, integrated gymna-
sia and security (Smith and Hubbard 2014). So why is it 
appropriate to describe students as an excluded group?
The answer is that students are identified as a dis-
tinctive and different group because their lifestyles are 
often perceived to lie outside the norms of society, mak-
ing them infrequent or unwelcome visitors in many of 
the spaces that are the loci of mainstream social life. 
Historically, this is related to popular understandings 
of students as politically radical, embracing alternative 
fashion and music in a way that marks them out as part 
of the ‘counter-culture’. In the contemporary context, it 
is also associated with stereotypes of students that sug-
gest they transgress the established social boundaries 
between work and play (and day and night) by holding 
late-night parties (at times when other people are sleep-
ing) and sleeping all day (when other people are work-
ing). Now, as you read this you will no doubt argue that 
the reality of the situation is a good deal more complex: 
not all students enjoy drinking, clubbing and partying to 
all hours – and those that do are often able to do so while 
devoting considerable time to their studies. Further, while 
some students remain deeply committed to issues such 
as environmentalism, animal rights or the restructuring 
of Third World debt, stereotypes of student radicalism, 
drug-taking and ‘free love’ which were consolidated in the 
late 1960s are now woefully inaccurate as descriptors of 
contemporary student cultures.
That said, it is possible that you may have experienced 
exclusion in your own life as a student. No doubt there are

As we have already seen, visceral metaphors also occur 
in the language used to describe those who live in poorer 
or deprived areas. For example, Ken Clarke, Conservative 
Home Secretary at the time, described the participants in 
the 2011 English riots as ‘feral’, invoking ideas that this 
group is less than human. Owen Jones (2012) – author 
of the book Chavs on the demonization of the British 
working class – also highlighted the ways in which the 
media rounded on the ‘rabble’ living in more deprived 
places, and used the label of ‘chav’ to reduce the complex 
causes of the rioting to the level of individual failings. 
Tyler (2013: 21) also describes the way that the poor in 
Britain have been described as ‘revolting’ subjects, known 
through a language which emphasizes their non-human 
and even animalistic characteristics. For Tyler, the brutal-
izing language of Otherness creates ‘abject’ figures who 
are required to do ‘the dirty work’ required by modern 
societies (e.g. work in the servicing economy in precari-
ous and poorly paid roles), but who are denied full inclu-
sion in that society because of their seeming vulgarity 
and lack of distinction. This invocation of the notion of 
social abjection betrays Tyler’s interest in the notion of 
disgust, a concept more associated with psychology than 
geography. This concept is significant for work on urban 
segregation in at least two senses. First, it emphasizes the 
way that fears of contamination, pollution and despoil-
ment fuels the policing of boundaries which may be 
boundaries of class, but may also be boundaries between 
different neighbourhoods. Second, it allows us to think 
about segregation as a socially lived process, which makes 
particular subjects the object of a violent, objectifying 
disgust and subjects then to control, stigma and censure.
In making such arguments, Tyler enriches the theo-
retical materials available to us for thinking about the 
ways that the projection of negative values onto Others 
produces social segregation, extending recent analyses of 
class relations in contemporary Britain (e.g. Skeggs 1997; 
Haylett 2001; Lawler 2005; Nayak 2006) by revealing a 
continuing devaluation of working class cultures created 
through repeated disgust reactions. This type of analysis 
suggests that highly diverse groups can become known 
through narrow social stereotypes, with these stereotypes 
shaping the relationship between them and dominant 
social groups. This suggests that while social exclusion has 
an important symbolic dimension, being created in the 
realms of representation. Here, the term representation 
is taken to encompass the wide range of media – such as 
films, TV, internet sites and newspapers – through which 
we come to understand the world and our place within it 
(Woodward 1997). Inevitably, such media provide a par-
tial and simplified view of the lifestyles of heterogeneous 
social groups. Although most people do not necessarily 
accept these stereotypes uncritically, they inevitably find 
We can see here that media stereotypes of students and 
student housing are mutually reinforcing in a variety of 
ways, and certainly many opponents of student housing 
allege that students do not look after their house because 
they are too busy socializing. A counter argument here is 
that the deleterious state of many student houses is down 
to the absentee landlords who fail to look after them, and, 
in any case, not all student households are noisy and dis-
regarding of their neighbours. No matter, all it takes is one 
or two instances of antisocial behaviour to reinforce popu-
lar stereotypes and instigate campaigns aiming to reduce 
student occupation in particular areas (such as Storer in 
Loughborough, Headingley in Leeds, Elvet in Durham and 
Selly Oak in Birmingham). In some cases, long-term resi-
dents even adopt the metaphor of ‘studenticide’, arguing 
that studentification needs to be reversed lest it destroys 
the urban social fabric: surveys suggest homeowners in 
UK cities now fear student neighbours more than squat-
ters. And this is not merely a UK phenomenon: studies of 
studentification suggest the proliferation of student hous-
ing is regularly opposed in the USA (Powell 2014), Europe 
(Boersma et al. 2013), China (He 2014) and beyond.
This discussion of studentification is highly relevant 
to our discussion of social exclusion, given it demon-
strates that some groups may experience stigmatization 
irrespective of their income or class. Yet talking about 
students as a marginal group remains problematic given 
students occupy their ambivalent social position for a 
short time only, and typically move from a marginalized 
and indebted position to one of relative affluence within 
a few years as they convert their education and cultural 
­capital into financial rewards. However, in other instances 
socially excluded groups suffer social stigmatization that 
is more likely to be associated with long-term ­financial 
exclusion or deprivation. For example, Gleeson (1998) 
suggests that people with a physical impairment or 
mobility problem typically find themselves excluded from 
workplaces designed around an able-bodied ideal. Here, 
the portrayal of the disabled as representing what Shake-
speare (1994) describes as the ‘imperfect physicality’ of 
human existence is a major factor, with the able-bodied 
remaining anxious about those who are visibly different. 
This found acute expression in the USA ‘ugly laws’ of the 
nineteenth century, which witnessed several cities forbid-
ding anyone from entering public space who was ‘dis-
eased, maimed or mutilated or anyway deformed to be 
an unsightly or disgusting object’ (taken from Ordinance 
passed in Chicago, 1881, cited in Schwiek, 2009). These 
acts were used to exclude the disabled from participation 
in mainstream urban life, compounding fears and fanta-
sies about those who appeared ‘different’, and collapsing 
a huge range of identities (and bodies) into a particular 
emergent category (the ‘disabled’).

216    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
homeowners in US cities reveals a ‘continuum’ of accept-
ance, where facilities for populations depicted as ‘differ-
ent’ (such as homes for the elderly) are regarded more 
favourably than those for populations stereotyped as 
‘dangerous’ or ‘deviant’ (such as those living with HIV) 
(Table 10.3). This frequently results in the concentration 
of facilities in inner-city areas where home-ownership 
rates are low and community opposition is least vocal 
(Case study 10.2). As DeVerteuil (2013) writes, NIMBY 
remains an important concept in urban social geography 
because it places attention precisely on how the forms 
of opposition to particular social groups takes spatial 
expression – and how, in turn, this maintains socio-spa-
tial segregations based on fears of Otherness.
NIMBY opposition to facilities for those living with 
HIV, those without homes, asylum seekers, people with 
disabilities and populations dependent on welfare hence 
demonstrates that the geographies of marginal groups 
are, to a lesser or greater extent, the product of domi-
nant imaginary geographies casting minorities as 
‘folk devils’ who need to be located elsewhere. As Sibley 
themselves drawing on them in their everyday life. What 
is especially significant about these stereotypes is that  
they are ideological in nature, in the sense they are gener-
ally created by (and in the interests of) dominant social 
groups – typically white, able-bodied, heterosexual, mid-
dle-class men. It is those who do not conform to their 
view of the world who are defined as society’s Others.
A vivid example of how such stereotyped images con-
tribute to social and spatial exclusion was provided by the 
media reporting of HIV/AIDS that occurred in the mid-
1980s. In the ensuing moral panic that followed diagno-
sis of the virus and its mode of transmission, a sometimes 
hysterical media began to focus on the groups most read-
ily identified as at risk – non-white ethnic minorities, 
intravenous-drug users and gay men (Watney 1987). The 
presence of HIV infection in these groups was generally 
perceived to be no accident, but portrayed as a condi-
tion affecting those whose ‘inner essence’ diverged from 
that of normal society (and whose lifestyles were judged 
to be incompatible with the maintenance of ‘family val-
ues’). Hence, sensationalist stories of sexual immorality, 
irresponsibility and wilful hedonism among those groups 
most affected by the virus were used to create social bar-
riers between the ‘healthy’ and those regarded as sexually 
promiscuous, socially irresponsible and unclean. Conse-
quently, this symbolic marking of HIV-infected groups 
as deviant informed their social exclusion, encouraging 
widespread discrimination, prejudice and neglect. As 
Wilton (1996) has shown, this had clear spatial effects, 
with those infected with HIV exhibiting ‘diminishing 
geographies’ as their access to the workplace, the home 
and the street was subject to increasing constraint. In his 
analysis, Wilton stresses that these constraints were not 
a product of the physical onset of AIDS but of the social 
stigma surrounding it. Symptoms of this stigma have 
included employers refusing to take on those with HIV, 
dentists refusing to treat them and, as Wilton relates, 
community groups opposing the construction of AIDS 
hospices in their neighbourhood.
Such neighbourhood opposition to community facili-
ties and welfare services is so widespread in Western soci-
ety, particularly in suburban landscapes, that few stop to 
question why people might object to such developments 
in their neighbourhood. Certainly, many NIMBY (Not 
In My Back Yard) campaigns are fought with reference 
to detrimental environmental impacts (such as noise or 
air pollution during construction). Such impacts are, to 
an extent, quantifiable; what is less measurable is the 
concern that homeowners have about the arrival of stig-
matized populations. However, for Takahashi and Dear 
(1997), community opposition to facilities for those living 
with AIDS/HIV is indicative of the more general antipa-
thy displayed towards Other populations. Their survey of

Chapter 10  Urban segregation and social inequality     217
10.3 Racial segregation in the city
The discussion above suggests that while society is highly 
diverse, some social differences are ‘amplified’ into sig­
nificance through practices of representation. An promi-
nent example here is the division of society on racial 
lines. Like class, age, or religion, race is a social con-
struct, an invention of the many discourses and images 
that suggest that our skin colour matters, with cultural 
difference following biological differentiation. Race, 
therefore, is intimately linked to racism. Unpacking the 
imaginary geographies that cast minorities to the mar-
gins, research in social geography has exposed the way 
that media negativity identifies ethnic minority groups 
as the source of social problems such as criminality, 
poor health and environmental decline (see Smith 1989a; 
Anderson 1991; Dunn 2001). Sibley (1999) accordingly 
argues that the equation of whiteness with purity, order 
and cleanliness in northern European cultures has been 
responsible for the creation of negative stereotypes of 
(for example) Africans, Afro-Caribbeans, people from 
(1995: 49) contends, this elsewhere might be nowhere, 
as when the genocide of gypsies and Jews was under-
taken by the Nazis, or it might simply be a space ‘out of 
sight’ of mainstream populations (such as the red-light 
districts that are the focus of sex work in many British 
cities – see Hubbard 1999). Predating the work of Tyler 
(2013), in Geographies of Exclusion, Sibley (1995) offered 
a theoretically informed account of how these imaginary 
geographies fuelled exclusionary practices. Drawing par-
ticularly on psychoanalytical ideas about the importance 
of maintaining self-identity (literally, maintaining the 
boundaries of the Self), Sibley argued that the urge to 
exclude threatening Others from one’s proximity is con-
nected to ideas about the importance of bodily cleanli-
ness, many of which may be inculcated in early infancy. 
Sibley detailed how fears of the Self being defiled are con-
sequently projected (or mapped) on to those individuals 
and groups depicted as polluting or dirty. In turn, Sibley 
argued that individuals adopt a series of exclusionary 
strategies designed to retain ‘psychic distance’ between 
themselves and Other groups, building symbolic, psycho-
logical and physical boundaries in the process.
Case study 10.2 
Community opposition to asylum 
seekers
In accordance with the United Nations’ protocol on 
refugees, the United Kingdom is obliged to offer 
asylum to those in fear of persecution on the basis 
of their race, religion or culture. However, in the late 
1990s, a mounting backlog of asylum applications, 
together with media stories of ‘bogus’ asylum seek-
ers, combined to demonize this group in the public 
imagination. One strategy adopted by the government 
as it sought to diffuse concern about the ‘wave’ of 
asylum seekers ‘flooding’ Britain was the dispersal of 
asylum seekers away from the Channel ports where 
their visibility had been exploited by right-wing groups 
intent on exploiting racist fears of difference. As part 
of this process of planned dispersal, the Home Office 
proposed the construction of accommodation cen-
tres for asylum seekers in a number of rural locales. 
However, this policy often met with considerable local 
opposition. For example, in February 2002, residents 
of Newton in Nottinghamshire learnt that the Home 
Office was planning to convert nearby RAF Newton 
into an accommodation centre for asylum seekers. 
A series of protests organized by the Newton Action 
Group expressed vehement opposition to the pro-
posal, with campaigners arguing that the develop-
ment would cause increases in crime, vandalism and 
social disorder, and that property prices would fall. 
One resident claimed that parents would be ‘terri-
fied of letting their children play out’, while another 
asked ‘Can we be assured there are no child abus-
ers, drug addicts or convicted rapists among them?’. 
The fact that this is by no means an isolated example 
demonstrates how effective the media have been 
at exploiting public anxieties about the threat that 
asylum seekers pose to the sanctity and purity of the 
nation. As an extremely vulnerable group, asylum 
seekers have been less able than some to oppose 
these racist myths, and many have reported harrow-
ing experiences of discrimination. For example, in the 
Sighthill area of Glasgow, the arrival of 1,200 Kurdish 
and Kosovan refugees in 2001 prompted a number 
of vicious assaults by local white youths who claimed 
the asylum seekers were being shown favouritism by 
the local council. Following a series of attacks, it took 
the murder of 22-year-old Kurdish asylum-seeker 
Firsat Dag to draw attention to the everyday rac-
ism fuelled by a media rhetoric that depicted asylum 
seekers as ‘social security scroungers’.

218    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
and bordering (Anderson 2010). In other contexts, this 
segregation has been institutional and via ‘tighter’ forms 
of control: for example, under apartheid in South Africa, 
the Group Areas Act prevented black people from stray-
ing into residential areas declared ‘white’, leaving a leg-
acy of cities that are sharply divided on ethnic lines (see  
Case study 10.3).
While segregationist policies have long been illegal in 
the USA, whiteness remains profoundly encoded in the 
city–suburb distinction that exists there, with the sub-
urbs seen to provide a refuge for the white middle classes 
from the dirt, disorder, and, above all, criminality of 
the coloured inner city (Valentine 2001). Indeed, the 
imagined association between areas of predominantly 
black residence and the welfare-dependent ‘ghetto’ has 
become so pernicious in the USA that it dominates 
white assumptions about Afro-American lifestyles, cre-
ating stereotypes that often bear little resemblance to 
black people’s urban experiences. Events such as the 
Rodney King riots of 1992 (prompted by the acquit-
tal of a white police officer for the filmed beating of 
a black Los Angeles resident) consolidated the reputa-
tion of the US ghetto as a crime-ridden environment; 
the Indian subcontinent and Roma gypsies. He contends 
that each of these groups has consequently been allocated 
only a marginal role in national cultures because of their 
‘threatening’ nature. In turn, such marginalization fuels 
spatial segregation, with the creation of ethnic-minority 
enclaves in the poorest neighbourhoods of many Euro-
pean cities being a product of personal prejudice in the 
job and housing markets that is fuelled by negative media 
stereotypes (Wacquant 2010). For example, in the UK 
there remains talk of white and non-white groups lead-
ing ‘parallel lives’, despite efforts at partnership designed 
to instil ‘community cohesion’: evidence suggests that the 
often-convivial everyday encounters that occur in public 
and workspaces between non-white and white individu-
als are not necessarily mirrored in the creation of resi-
dentially-mixed neighbourhoods (Swanton 2010). In this 
context, some have suggested ethic segregation in the UK 
is largely ‘voluntary’ – and hence self-segregation by both 
white and non-white groups. While this conclusion is dis-
puted in some quarters (see Peach 1996; Phillips 2006), 
it suggests that cultural racism and processes of fear, 
resentment and prejudice maybe more significant than 
institutional or state-sponsored attempts at segregation 
Case study 10.3 
Ethnic division in apartheid cities
Apartheid-era South Africa is often cited as representing 
an extreme example of socio-spatial segregation, with 
a white minority population passing a series of Acts in 
the mid-twentieth century designed to circumscribe the 
mobility of coloured, Indian and African people. Under 
apartheid laws, non-whites were denied access to major 
cities except if in possession of a pass that indicated 
they were gainfully employed in the city. As such, while 
the ruling white minority depicted non-whites as racially 
inferior, they recognized their importance as a source 
of unskilled and semi-skilled labour. Initially, non-white 
workers were housed in barracks or municipal hostels 
where they were subject to regimentation designed to 
curb the ‘animal instincts’ of natives and instil the impor-
tance of ‘the proper habits of work and life’ (Popke 2001: 
740). The understanding that non-whites possessed use-
ful and productive bodies, yet were prone to indolence 
and incivility, was clearly connected to colonial repre-
sentations that associated non-whiteness with savagery, 
animality and nature, characteristics that were repressed 
in ‘civilized’ Western cultures (Anderson 2000).
However, the continued growth of non-white ‘shanty 
towns’ around the periphery of major cities fuelled 
white fears of ‘swaart gevaar’ (black danger), and led 
to national legislation designed to construct buffer 
zones between the white city and non-white townships. 
Both physically and symbolically on the margins of 
South African cities, the townships thus became abject 
landscapes, depicted by the white media as spaces 
of vice, disease and lawlessness. Repeated attempts 
at creating racially sanitized, planned townships were 
thus part of an explicit attempt to modernize South 
African society while maintaining the distance between 
poorer non-white groups and the affluent white city.
Rather than suggesting that the apartheid city 
represents a racist distortion of the processes of seg-
regation evident elsewhere in the world, more recent 
commentaries on the apartheid era suggest it illustrates 
the racist conceits that underpinned twentieth-century 
modernism (Robinson 1997; Popke 2001). As such, 
it is possible to identify planning and ‘improvement’ 
schemes as underpinned by racist imaginaries through-
out the world (and not just in those nations with a colo-
nial history). Indeed, despite the abolition of apartheid 
Group Area Acts, racist fears of difference continue to 
fuel socio-spatial exclusions in South Africa, with the 
growth in gated communities being merely one mani-
festation of this (Jurgens and Gnad 2002).

Chapter 10  Urban segregation and social inequality     219
Though nearly 30 years old, Wolfe’s depiction 
remains revealing of white anxieties. This depiction 
of the Bronx as a wasteland inhabited by ‘lots of dark 
faces’ again reminds us of the ways in which fears of 
difference (in this example, based on skin colour) can 
provoke anxiety and feed the urge to exclude. From the 
perspective of the white narrator in Wolfe’s book, the 
urban decay of the Bronx mirrors his perceived view 
of the city’s black population as Other: they are street 
people rather than the ‘air people’ who inhabit his social 
world (adopting Raban’s, 1990, memorable description 
of those who can afford to distance themselves from 
marginal places).
For many Afro-Americans, ghetto life is similarly typi-
fied by anxiety, but an anxiety originating from problems 
of poverty (in 2012, 25 per cent of black families were 
living below the US poverty line, and 42 per cent of black 
single parent families, a figure which has increased since 
2000). As the renowned feminist and cultural theorist bell 
hooks relates, the experience of living in the black ghetto 
is one that consistently reinforces feelings of subordina-
tion and inferiority:
To be in the margin is to be part of the whole but 
outside the main body. As black Americans living in a 
small Kentucky town, the railroad tracks were a daily 
reminder of our marginality. Across those tracks were 
paved streets, stores we could not enter and restau-
rants we could not eat in, and people we could not 
look directly in the face. Across these tracks was 
a world we could work in as maids, as janitors, as 
prostitutes, as long as it was in a service capacity. We 
could enter that world, but we could not live there. We 
always had to return to the margin, to cross the tracks, 
to shacks and abandoned houses on the edge of town.
(hooks 1984: 9)
Until the 1960s it was not uncommon to find spe-
cific planning ordinances and zoning laws controlling 
the development of black neighbourhoods. Although 
such laws have long since been overturned, the legacy 
of these remain in the racist practices of mortgage 
financiers, banks and estate agents, who may seek to 
maintain the blackness or whiteness of particular neigh-
bourhoods in the interests of maintaining house prices 
(Short 1996). It is thus unsurprising that the Otherness 
of the Afro-American population is mirrored in what 
has been termed hypersegregation, with black peo-
ple remaining more spatially concentrated than any 
other US ethnic minority. The average black citizen 
lives in a neighbourhood that is 45 per cent black, even 
though blacks only make up 13 per cent of the overall 
US population (Logan 2013). However, Dissimilarity 
although the areas of unrest were typically those with 
the poorest income levels, high population densities and 
high school-dropout rates, it was the ‘racial character’ 
of these areas that was highlighted in the subsequent 
reporting (Smith 1995).
This association between US minority populations 
and specific criminalized places has been cemented over 
the years in those media that have used ‘ghetto’ as a 
coded term for the imagined deviance of black peo-
ple (especially black men). As McCarthy et al. (1997) 
argue, the American middle classes tend to learn more 
about black inner cities through ‘long-distanced’ media 
images than through personal everyday interactions. 
Stories of ‘black-on-black’ violence abound in the 
media, with black urban males depicted as the main 
criminal threat in the USA (Wilson 2005). The cultural 
responses – in the form of black media practices – have 
been ambivalent in their outcomes, with the gangsta rap 
that emerged in the 1990s accused of banalizing every-
day violence and gun crime. Even ‘new wave’ black cin-
ema such as Menace II Society, Boyz ‘n the Hood, Jungle 
Fever and Straight Outta Brooklyn, which sought to 
show something of the reality of everyday life for Afro-
Americans, ultimately served to stereotype such places 
as landscapes of endemic violence and drug dependence 
(Benton 1995). In this context, ‘urban’ cinema, film and 
literature can be seen as a corroboration of dominant 
white myths that imagine drugs, guns and criminality 
to be part of everyday ghetto life. Such white fears and 
fantasies about the black inner city are acidly invoked 
in Wolfe’s (1988) fictional account of the Wall Street 
trader, Sherman McCoy, who one night takes the wrong 
turning on his drive home only to be confronted with a 
side of New York that he remains cosseted from in his 
‘yuppie’ housing development:
At the next corner, he turned – west, he figured – and 
followed that street a few blocks. There were more low 
buildings. They might have been garages, they might 
have been sheds. There were fences with spirals of 
razor wire on top. But the streets were deserted, which 
was okay, he told himself. Yet he could feel his heart 
beating with a nervous twang. Then he turned again. 
A narrow street with seven or eight storey apartment 
buildings; no sign of people, not a light in a window. 
The next block, the same. He turned again, and as 
he rounded the corner – astonishing. Utterly empty, 
a vast open terrain . . . here and there were traces of 
rubble and slag. The earth looked like concrete, except 
it rolled down this way, and up that . . . the hills and 
dales of the Bronx . . . reduced to asphalt, concrete 
and cinders.
(Wolfe 1988: 65)

220    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
disinvestment was part of a deliberate attempt to cut 
back on public spending by withdrawing services from 
the very districts most in need. As they detail them, the 
long-term consequences have often been catastrophic 
(including increases in infant mortality rates, low birth 
weights, cirrhosis, TB and AIDS-related deaths). At the 
same time, many areas stigmatized as pockets of black 
poverty have become insurance no-go zones where small 
businesses find it impossible to get insurance because pre-
miums are so high, and large percentages of the popula-
tion are denied car insurance because of excessive costs. 
Moreover, the intensification of the activities of police, 
courts and prison is recognized to have disproportion-
ately affected such ‘imploding ghettos’, with the mass 
incarceration of young, working class African American 
men seen by many as a state strategy designed to ‘dis-
cipline’ and manage the socially dispossessed (Waquant 
2010). It is for such reasons that some ­commentators still 
feel justified in speaking of the ‘apartheid’ of American 
cities (Wallace and Wallace 1998).
10.4 Gentrification: reclaiming  
the margins?
As already noted, all cities possess less affluent areas, 
whether these are described as ‘problem’ estates, welfare-
dependent neighbourhoods or racialised ghettos. Often, 
the boundaries of such places have remained stubbornly 
recalcitrant over time, even if the individuals and groups 
Indexes exploring how the Afro-American population 
is distributed relative to the white population suggest 
that their segregation has actually declined over the 
past 30 years (see Table 10.4). Yet the declines remain 
modest, and some metropolitan areas actually experi-
enced an increase in residential segregation over the 
period 1980–2010 (the seven highest increases all in the 
southern USA, including Columbus, GA; Goldsboro, 
NC; Athens, GA; and Danville, VA). Wilson (2005) also 
notes a deepening of poverty within the most ghettoized 
neighbourhoods, measured through the ratio of high- to 
low-income residents, with the ratio of rich to poor in 
Chicago’s Englewood and Woodlawn neighbourhoods 
increasing by 40 per cent between 1990 and 2000, and 
80 per cent in Cleveland Hough and Fairfax in the same 
period. Workfare programmes fail to alleviate the situa-
tion, with the poorest forced into dead-end and demean-
ing employment for minimal wages.
While the disappearance of well-paid work from US 
inner cities (and the associated out-migration of the 
black middle class) has been postulated as the major 
cause of such concentrated black poverty in the USA, 
Mohan (2000) argues that such factors alone cannot 
explain the continuing segregation of Afro-Americans. 
Instead, he suggests it is necessary to consider the whole-
sale institutional abandonment that has accompanied 
the economic stigmatization of Afro-American com-
munities. Coining the phrase ‘desertification’ to describe 
the planned shrinkage of essential health, welfare and 
emergency services in the Bronx in the 1970s and 1980s, 
Wallace and Wallace (1998, 2000) suggested that such

diversify housing with an eye to ending the status of such 
areas as homogeneously working class or ‘poor’ places. 
The key assumption here has been that mixing different 
types of housing tenure would lead to greater social mix 
and to positive effects for (poor) urban residents and for 
deprived neighbourhoods at large.
The impact of such urban regeneration is decidedly 
mixed. Suffice to say, many policies of regeneration 
appear to be ‘taking back’ the margins from marginal 
people, rather than empowering them, effectively trans-
forming landscapes of poverty and decay into prestigious 
(and ordered) space through selective investment and 
redevelopment aiming at attracting more affluent resi-
dents. For example, some have argued that the ­public–
private partnerships which are being undertaken by the 
majority of London boroughs in order to regenerate 
council estates, are merely leading to the displacement 
of long-established residents (e.g. see Lees 2014 on Lon-
don’s Aylesbury estate). This is a process being resisted 
by some residents, albeit it has required emphasis on the 
right of families to remain in place to secure notable press 
coverage (see Plate 10.3). Hence, the net result of such 
improvement policy is often the onset of gentrification. 
A much-debated phenomenon in urban social geography, 
gentrification is the process by which poor neighbour-
hoods are transformed by an influx of affluent homebuy-
ers and renters. In some instances, this involves individual 
gentrifiers buying existing properties and transforming 
them (often with governmental subsidy); in others, it 
involves the wholesale replacement of low-income hous-
ing with prestigious apartments by corporate developers 
(Davidson and Lees 2010). Either way, the net result is 
often one of displacement, with former residents fre-
quently unable to afford to live in gentrified areas which 
become characterised by shops and cultural facilities 
which cater exclusively for incoming populations (an 
they contain have changed (an example here might be the 
persistence of the inner city as a disordered or transient 
urban zone given the earliest mappings of the Chicago 
School identified it as such). This is clearly connected to 
questions of power, with dominant social groups able to 
physically and symbolically claim the centres, marginal-
izing the less powerful:
Centre/periphery distinctions tend frequently to be 
associated with endurance in time. Those who occupy 
centres establish themselves as having control over 
resources which allow them to maintain differentials 
between themselves and those in peripheral regions. 
The established may employ a variety of forms of 
social closure to sustain distance from others who are 
effectively treated as outsiders.
(Giddens 1991: 131)
In this chapter we have already examined numerous 
processes which tend to spatially isolate and exclude less 
powerful groups in urban space – e.g. social prejudice, 
institutional racism, NIMBY politics and so on. Yet 
there are significant policy processes which also effect 
such spaces, with urban policy in particular often prefig-
ured on the idea that marginal places need to be bought 
back into the ‘mainstream’ in the interests of economic 
development as well as social cohesion. In many nations, 
such policies are underpinned by an increasingly com-
plex diversity of agencies and partnerships, blurring 
the distinction between public and private sectors as 
property developers and policy-actors work in tandem 
to regenerate deprived areas and engineer urban regen-
eration. Here, a notable trend has been to achieve this 
through policies promoting social mix. For example, in 
many local authority housing estates and ‘projects’ in the 
USA and UK, there has been an attempt to redevelop and

the leading neo-Marxist urban commentators, Neil Smith 
(1996), famously argued that gentrification ultimately only 
occurs if the gap between actual and potential land value 
is such that property development becomes lucrative. In 
such circumstances, the processes of disinvestment associ-
ated with marginalization become the precursor to a sub-
sequent wave of reinvestment. But for profits to be realized, 
the marginalized groups and land-uses which occupy these 
devalued spaces must be driven out, so that potential devel-
opers can view them as safe investment opportunities. It is 
here that the role of the local state is crucial. Smith (2002: 
442) pointed to this when he detailed how squatters, the 
homeless, squeegee merchants and ‘street people’ were 
ruthlessly dealt with in New York following the election of 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and appointment of Police Com-
missioner William Bratton. Espousing a rhetoric of Zero 
Tolerance for miscreants, these individuals were pivotal in 
identifying the urban disadvantaged as a disorderly popu-
lation. This urge to tame urban disorder was to trigger 
notorious police brutality against minorities, justified with 
reference to the need for improved quality of life, but actu-
ally intended, Smith argues, to make particular areas of the 
city safe for corporate gentrification (and the associated 
invasion of upper-income groups). One notable example 
of this process was the wholesale removal of the homeless 
and their supporters from Tompkins Square Park at a time 
when developers were seeking to sell the Lower East Side as 
a space for ‘family’ residence. The seizure and subsequent 
‘purification’ of the park (and surrounding areas) serves 
to underline how exclusionary urges may turn a genuinely 
public space into a space reserved for those who accord 
with mainstream ideas of living and working (see also 
Mitchell 1996).
issue highlighted by the protests against ‘hipster’ cafes in 
the East End of London in 2015) (Hubbard 2016).
Marginalized populations may see their neighbour-
hoods enjoy a spectacular renaissance, but often do not 
share in its subsequent prosperity (Lees 2008). While lit-
tle is known about displacement and its consequences, 
Dutch research (Kleinhans 2003) suggests personality can 
be important in shaping experiences of displacement, with 
more resilient individuals most able to take a positive view 
of the ‘relocation’ process. In a UK context, longitudinal 
research in Glasgow by Kearns and Mason (2013) also sug-
gests that there might be a difference in the ‘psychosocial’ 
impacts of displacement between those willing to move 
and those who are reluctant movers. Their conclusion was 
that ‘most of those who moved considered that they had 
“bettered” their residential conditions, though again less 
so in neighbourhood than in dwelling terms’ (Kearns and 
Mason 2013: 195). This suggests that the displaced might 
end up with better housing conditions, but not necessarily 
in neighbourhoods that provide them with a satisfactory 
quality of life or ‘sense of belonging’.
For such reasons, most Western cities appear to be see-
ing changes in patterns of segregation, with the emergent 
of affluent enclaves and gentrified developments displacing 
and scattering the urban poor, with the latter sometimes 
forced to relocate to different towns and cities. Hence, while 
gentrification might instigate processes of improvement 
that have long-term benefits for marginal groups (and the 
jury is still out on ‘trickle-down’ urban theory), most geog-
raphers remain sanguine about their impacts. Gentrifica-
tion, it seems, can be conceptualized as yet another form of 
profit-generation for the wealthy, representing a property 
wager rather than an investment in people. Indeed, one of 
Case study 10.4 
Gated communities in Uruguay
One of the most obvious symptoms of social division 
in our cities is the presence of gated communities 
(Kenna and Dunn 2009). These communities currently 
enjoy a widespread popularity because their design 
promises security as well as a sense of belonging: 
residents typically sign up to a legally binding code of 
conduct that ensures all residents understand their 
rights and responsibilities as members of a com-
munity. Physically separated from the wider city, and 
often offering a privatized form of social life through 
the provision of enclosed gardens, gymnasia, shops 
and facilities, gated communities have been postulated 
as offering a new form of urbanism that may rekin-
dle sociality and encourage diverse peoples to live 
together. In most cases, however, gated communi-
ties have been found to promote social dissociation 
and sharpen social segregation, being woven into 
processes of gentrification and urban revanchism 
by catering to middle-class tastes (and incomes) 
(Atkinson and Flint 2004).
In the case of Montevideo (Uruguay), there are still 
only a handful of gated communities (certainly if com-
pared to its Latin American neighbours). Alvarez-Riva-
dulla (2007: 51) points out that the majority of these 
are peripheral to the city centre in the Carrasco sub-
urb, and offer a semi-rural setting in which the urban

Chapter 10  Urban segregation and social inequality     223
The vicious urban revanchism that Smith docu-
ments is a symptom of the deep-rooted fear amongst 
white middle- and upper-class citizens of Other popula-
tions, be they the unemployed, sex workers, the home-
less and immigrants. It is very common for mainstream 
middle-class groups to wax lyrical about urban living, 
and celebrate the diversity of the city, but all too few 
seem prepared to leave the suburbs unless it is for a simi-
larly homogeneous gentrified inner-city district (Atkin-
son and Flint 2004). Moreover, these tendencies are not 
merely confined to the urban West, and it is easy to find 
instances of marginalized populations being displaced 
throughout the global South as shanty towns or informal 
settlements are bulldozed to make way for new middle-
class developments, gated communities, shopping centres 
and highway developments (see Case study 10.4). Though 
often resisted, the net result is the corporate gentrifica-
tion of city centres worldwide, to the extent that the CBD 
of Manila now looks very much the same as the CBD of 
Sydney (­Winchester et al. 2003). While such processes of 
corporate gentrification may ultimately attract mobile 
consumer capital, and tie Third World cities into a net-
work of world cities, the consequence is of course the pro-
duction of new landscapes of exclusion and segregation.
The prognosis here for marginal groups is not good, as 
some of the main policies advocated in their name seem 
destined to serve interests other than their own. But while 
such practices of regeneration tend to carve up space in 
favour of powerful middle-class elites, it is dangerous to 
suggest that poorer groups are unable to resist these pro-
cesses. For example, some excluded groups may well resist 
forms of social closure by transgressing into the spaces 
of the powerful, challenging taken-for-granted expecta-
tions about where they should locate (Cresswell 1996). 
Such transgressions may trigger a moral panic (such as 
that which surrounded asylum seekers in the late 1990s 
or people living with HIV in the 1980s), encouraging new 
forms of social and spatial control. This control is often 
underpinned by the use of police power, as was the case 
with the French banlieue riots, where curfews were rigor-
ously enforced in affected areas. In such cases, practices of 
spatial ordering and surveillance quickly reassert the social 
order, and remind people of their place. However, trans-
gressions may also set in motion social changes by chal-
lenging assumptions about who or what belongs where. 
Parades, sit-ins, strikes, squats: all enact an opposition 
that, however fleeting, may bring about a change in social 
attitudes. For instance, gay pride marches in Western cit-
ies have often drawn attention to homophobia in society, 
and over time have encouraged the repeal of discrimina-
tory legislation; perhaps less successfully, Muslim-identi-
fying populations have pursued a variety of public actions 
designed to topple the Islamophobia that is rampant in 
the Western nations.
Developing these ideas on transgression and resistance, 
geographers have hence conceptualized places on the mar-
gin as sites where the relatively powerless can organize 
themselves into self-supporting cultures of resistance and 
threats of downtown Montevideo are far removed: ‘bird 
song replaces traffic noise, the grey of the city gives 
way to shades of green’. As is the case in most gated 
communities, however, the residents are remarkably 
homogeneous in terms of age, family status and class, 
as well as sharing certain cultural dispositions (such 
as their enthusiasm for golf). Their social life tends to 
be strongly family-oriented, and inward- rather than 
outward-looking. The occupants are manifestly not part 
of any global elite, but are significantly more affluent 
than the average for the city. Significantly, as Alvarez-
Rivadulla (2007) notes, this is not a group that had 
ever mixed with less affluent groups (even if it shares 
the same urban public spaces and neighbourhoods 
with them). As such, gated communities reinforce 
already-existing social tendencies, feeding on fears of 
difference and myths of urban danger.
Alvarez-Rivadulla (2007) concludes that the 
reasons that the occupants of Montevideo’s gated 
communities move to them are not so different 
from the motivations listed by suburban dwellers in 
studies in the UK and the USA: a desire to escape 
the unpredictability of the city, seek stability and 
put down roots. Located on the periphery of the 
city – an area traditionally associated with Montevi-
deo’s urban poor – these gated communities have 
effectively displaced working class and marginal 
populations in shanty dwellings, and raised land val-
ues in the vicinity, exacerbating contrasts between 
the traditionally affluent neighbourhoods and the 
neighbourhoods belonging to the urban poor. In a 
reversal of the trends we noted earlier in the chap-
ter, an archipelago of affluent gated communities 
can be seen to be emerging within a sea of poverty 
(as opposed to cities in the USA and UK, where 
we noted the existence of islands of deprivation 
increasingly dissociated from an otherwise mobile 
and affluent city).

cooperation. For example, so-called ‘gay ghetto’ areas in 
the USA (e.g. Castro in San Francisco, or West Hollywood 
in Los Angeles), France (e.g. the Marais, Paris) and South 
Africa (e.g. De Waterkant, Cape Town) have been trans-
formed from marginal spaces of persecution to relatively 
affluent centres of gay male cultural life through political 
organization, creativity and activism, creating new gay 
identities in the process (see Forest 1995; Visser 2003; Siba-
lis 2004; Hubbard 2012). Likewise, alternative economies 
thrive in many racialized areas (particularly in the cultural 
industries – food, music, fashion, arts and media), allowing 
‘ethnic entrepreneurs’ to bring different values and ideas to 
the attention of wider audiences, making them more main-
stream in the process. This gradual demarginalization 
process may, over time, bring excluded populations into the 
mainstream – though the debate on the possibilities of this 
remains heated. Indeed, there remains considerable debate 
about the degree to which the physical characteristics of a 
neighbourhood have an impact on the lives of its inhabit-
ants, and whether moving poor people into more affluent 
areas actually improves their quality of life.
10.5 Conclusion
Segregation is just one of many issues explored by urban 
social geographers. It is also something of a timeless 
issue, threatening to drift into abeyance until events like 
the English riots of 2011 or the French suburban riots 
of 2007 thrust it back into the limelight. But beyond the 
headlines, we must acknowledge it remains one of the 
most important issues facing society in the twenty-first 
century. As we have seen, many societies possess ‘wild’ 
and ‘untamed’ urban zones – ghettos, slums, banlieues, 
favelas – as well as more mundane sites of marginaliza-
tion, poverty and stigma. While we need to be wary of 
suggesting these sites share common characteristics (e.g. 
the multi-ethnic make up of the French banlieue or many 
British inner cities stands in stark contrast to the eth-
nic homogeneity of the US ‘ghetto’), there are a number 
of key themes that geographers routinely invoke when 
analysing their geographies: namely, exclusion, margin-
alization and segregation. Taken together, these themes 
emphasize the fact that space is never an abstract surface 
on which social life is played out, but is socially produced. 
As such, research on urban geographies of residential seg-
regation does not just provide valuable insights into the 
particular combination of problems that beset our most 
vulnerable urban populations; it also makes a key con-
tribution to theoretical debates about the role of urban 
space in constructing socially significant categories of 
identity and difference (such as class, gender, sexuality 
and race). In the final analysis, the concept of urban seg-
regation is not solely of relevance to the issues of social 
inequality discussed in this chapter: it is fundamental to 
making sense of the diversity that characterizes the con-
temporary world.
Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter, you should be able to:
● Understand that cities are divided in ways that often 
segregate stigmatized ‘Other’ groups.
● Appreciate the complexity of the processes 
encouraging this segregation, including people’s 
desire to distance themselves from populations 
represented by the media as threatening or polluting.
● Identify the characteristics of urban spaces of 
exclusion, which tend to lack economic, social or 
political infrastructure, and are typified by health 
problems and a poor quality of life for those who 
live there.
● Recognize the importance of spatial stigmatization 
in exacerbating social divides; once a neighbour-
hood has obtained a reputation as a space of 
exclusion, it is unlikely to attract investment of a 
type that will benefit its inhabitants.
● Understand that efforts to reclaim spaces of 
exclusion in the name of improvement and ‘urban 
regeneration’ often instigate urban gentrification – a 
process that often triggers new forms of spatial 
purification and exclusion rather than social mixing.

W
hat do you think of when you use the term ‘rural’? 
Your response will be influenced heavily by where 
you ‘come from’ in both a territorial and sociocultural 
sense. It is an assumption, but if you are from Britain 
you might imagine black and white cottages, beauti-
ful tidy villages, welcoming pubs, neat hedge rows, 
and charming village fêtes. I am from such a place 
and despite doing rural geography research across the 
globe in order to experience and try to understand 
multiple rural worlds, this is still what comes to my 
mind. Yet, perceptions of the ‘rural’ will be far less 
pleasant in Tonga, for example. There it might be sug-
gested that poor infrastructure, absence of electricity, 
grinding poverty, patriarchal governance systems, vul-
nerable housing, environmental deterioration, and 
marginal and precarious livelihoods characterize such 
places (see Plates 11.1 and 11.2 for example). This is 
not to suggest that all is well with the countryside in 
the global North and ill in the global South; margin-
alization and poverty are increasingly recognized to be 
part of rich-world rural areas, just as there are pockets 
of privilege in rural areas in poorer countries. Further-
more, within and between the global South and global 
North there are widely different rural geographical 
imaginations: in Australia the concept of ‘rural’ tends 
to be associated with wilderness, whereas in Western 
Europe notions of the rural tend to be more idyllic. 
In the Americas, for example, Argentinian notions of 
the rural – of unkempt green fields, horseback riders, 
unpaved roads, and vineyards set against the snowy 
Andes – are very different to what might be imagined 
in the US West, where de-populated settlements, iconic 
landforms, drought and desert might be pictured (see 
Plates 11.3 and 11.4). The point being made here is 
that imaginaries and indeed realities of the ‘rural’ are 
not homogenous across the globe either within or 
between regions and territories, varying across time 
and space in ways that alter how the rural is defined, 
interacted with, inhabited, interpreted and socially 
constructed.
Much recent work in rural geography, in both the 
Anglo/North American/Australasian (ANAA) tradi-
tion and increasingly in other geographical communi-
ties across the world such as those of Latin America, 
South-east Asia and the Pacific Islands, has sought to 
show that there are in fact rural worlds within worlds 
and that peoples’ identity and social position play a role 
in the way rural spaces are conceptualized and experi-
enced. Furthermore, as already suggested, the experience 
of the rural varies widely between the global North and 
global South, though much more geographical research

and local environmental issues, though arguably less 
pressing than those in the South, are also considerable 
and the use of the rural idyll as a marketing tool to com-
modify ‘countryside’ means that the rural is important 
across the urban/rural divide. Far from being stagnant 
or in decline, as it is sometimes portrayed as for exam-
ple in British sit-com The Last of the Summer Wine, the 
‘rural’ is shifting rapidly – and these changes are existent 
in and have implications for global society as a whole. 
This chapter looks first at how we might define the term 
‘rural’; it then turns to how geographers have approached 
and theorized change in such places. We then move on 
to consider changing global rural geographies in terms 
of demographic, political, cultural and economic shifts.
11.1 Words and worlds: what is ‘rural’?
What is meant by the term ‘rural’? As already discussed 
above, meanings and definitions vary across cultures and 
places. At the general level, there are two ways we can 
approach defining the rural. The first set of approaches 
might be termed empirical, and includes functional 
approaches including measuring land-use characteris-
tics as well as demographic approaches that involve such 
things as population density measures. The second set 
of definitions can be termed conceptual and does not 
use directly quantifiable measures of rurality, drawing 
instead on social constructs, which have to do with 
how we imagine the countryside.
Governments have their own methodologies for 
delimiting what is meant by rural, which are generally 
empirical and are important for planning and develop-
ment purposes. Using a functional definition assumes 
that there is a rural/urban dichotomy and that the rural 
is defined by what it is not – that is, not urban. But this 
on the latter is required (Murray 2008). Although rural 
spaces differ vastly across the world, arguably they form 
interlinked parts of one global complex. As such, as glo-
balization unfolds, the social, economic and environmen-
tal shifts that are occurring in rural worlds everywhere 
do not occur in isolation (Murray and Overton 2014). 
This chapter investigates a range of perspectives on rural 
worlds from different geographical viewpoints. In doing 
so, it purposefully draws on my own fieldwork-based 
examples from around the globe to paint a picture of 
the highly dynamic and increasingly interwoven spaces 
we term ‘rural’.
From the vantage point of highly urbanized societies 
that tend to characterize the global North (and Latin 
America in the global South), it is easy to forget that just 
under half (46 per cent in 2014) of the world’s population 
lives in rural areas, representing a total of 3.36 billion 
people. In both absolute and relative senses the global 
South is more rural with 3.09 billion inhabitants repre-
senting 52 per cent of the total population of the South 
in 2014. Africa and Asia accounted for close to 90 per 
cent of the global rural population in 2014 with close to 
1.5 billion rural inhabitants in India and China alone. 
The vast majority of the rural world then is Southern. In 
the global North in 2014 there were just under 276 mil-
lion rural inhabitants, representing 22 per cent of total 
population there (UN 2014c). As such, it could be argued 
that rural geography, at the global scale, should be prin-
cipally concerned with issues of social, economic, envi-
ronmental and cultural change in poorer countries. This 
is why this chapter seeks balance in this respect, build-
ing on examples from both the global North and South. 
The issues at stake in rural worlds across the world are 
serious and pressing, and concern billions of people. In 
the rural global South, poverty and deprivation are high, 
cultural loss and environmental degradation is advancing 
rapidly. In the rural global North social justice concerns

the rural. Under such definitions rural is something in the 
mind – and thus rural ‘social’ space need not correspond 
with rural ‘geographic’ space. More will be said on this 
issue when we consider how rural geography has itself 
changed over recent years.
Cloke (2000: 718) defines the ‘rural’ as:
Areas which are dominated by extensive land uses 
such as agriculture or forestry, or by large open 
spaces of underdeveloped land, which contain small, 
lower order settlements demonstrating a strong rela-
tionship between buildings and extensive landscape, 
and which are perceived as rural by most residents. 
(Emphasis added)
The emphasis is added above in order to highlight the 
fact that rural geographers have come to think of ‘rural-
ity’ as much as a state of mind as one based on a specific 
configuration of functions. Cloke goes on to argue that 
while some rural areas are still defined functionally, in 
those closer to urban centres ‘rural is more of a socially 
constructed and culturally constructed and therefore 
contested category’ (Cloke 2000: 718). This latter point 
is most relevant to the global North where the blurring 
between urban and rural is increasingly pronounced 
and where cultural commodification of the countryside 
and the construction of the rural idyll are widespread. 
As we will see, although these processes are evident in 
some cases, rurality in the global South generally has very 
different connotations.
11.2 Changing rural geographies
In order to understand the geographies of rural space, it 
is useful to review the evolution of rural geography as a 
sub-discipline. Rural geography is the study of the rela-
tionship between humans and the environment in rural 
areas, the nature of rural localities, economies, societies, 
cultures and environments and how this varies across 
space. Trajectories within the sub-discipline vary mark-
edly across the world, but in the ANAA tradition there 
has been a relatively common path. Within the context of 
geography in general, rural geography has, until recently, 
been somewhat neglected. This may be because in richer 
countries the rural population is a minority. Also, it could 
be argued that much Western scholarship carries an urban 
bias, based on the assumption that it is in such areas that 
social progress is designed and experienced. The past 
25 years has seen a rise in interest in rural geography in 
the ANAA tradition and rural areas in the global North 
are seen as spaces where general cultural and economic 
processes can be researched, understood and interpreted. 
rural/urban dichotomy will vary between places greatly, 
as both the rural and the urban are variously understood. 
In the Pacific Island territories, such as Fiji, Samoa or 
Rapa Nui (a.k.a Easter Island), many of the areas that are 
defined as urban in official statistics would likely be seen 
as rural areas to people from the North; such areas often 
have lush vegetation, informal communal gardens and 
relatively low-density populations. Rapa Nui is defined as 
100 per cent urbanized in official statistics, for example, 
as all of its approximately 3,800 inhabitants are located in 
the capital Hanga Roa (see Plate 11.5). This low-density 
settlement would most likely not be considered ‘urban’ 
by Western standards, however. In this sense, using 
functional as well as demographic and other empirical 
measures leads to complexities when intended to allow 
comparison across societies.
Human geographers realize that the rural and urban 
overlap in many ways. It is common to refer to peri-
urban, rurban and semi-urban areas. In this regard, some 
have argued that rural and the urban are best thought of 
as lying on a rural–urban continuum. Overall, it is now 
recognized that seeking to define the rural and the urban 
in opposition to each other (what are sometimes called 
binaries) is not the most useful approach. Both political 
economy and more recent cultural approaches to rural 
geography emphasize, in various ways, that rural and 
urban spaces are constructed by processes that cut across 
both, and that whilst the impacts of these processes on 
the ground will not be equal they are responding to com-
mon stimuli (see Chapter 9).
Conceptual definitions of rural are important, and not 
as obscure as they may appear at first. As we will see, eco-
nomic opportunities, planning, infrastructure develop-
ment and many other ‘concrete’ outcomes are predicated 
on how individuals, collectives and governments imagine

230    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
Argentinian rural geography has long been dominated by 
land use analysis, functional definitions, and quantifica-
tion oriented towards planning and poverty alleviation, 
for example, although there are signs this is changing in 
the fieldwork of a new generation of researchers. In this 
sense, as Roche (2002) argues in a classic review article, 
it is more meaningful to talk of rural ‘geographies’ rather 
than a singular geography.
The most recent turn in rural geography has been pro-
foundly influenced by the general cultural turn in human 
geography which itself was stimulated by the shift to 
postmodern ideas in the social sciences. This shift has 
by no means been homogenous and there are commenta-
tors who have argued that this has made our rural geogra-
phies less rather than more relevant (see Wilson and Rigg 
2003). In the global South new rural cultural geographies 
have been eclipsed by the study of what is perceived as 
more pressing socio-economic and environmental con-
cerns. As a consequence the exploration of important 
cultural themes has been woeful. Only recently have we 
seen the emergence of more ‘holistic’ approaches, for 
example such as Desarollo rural con identidad (rural 
development with identity) in countries including Peru, 
Mexico and Ecuador. The cultural approach, then, seeks 
to break down old binaries and structures, interrogating 
rurality as an environmental as well as social construct, 
which is participated in by persons of shared cultural, 
social and moral values. Crucially, the social space of the 
rural (which can be imagined and thus be located any-
where) need not necessarily overlap with the territorial 
space of the rural. Thus the new rural geography engages 
with ideas that have to do with the social construction 
of categories, and the way they are then represented and 
reproduced.
Partly in response to the cultural turn, political 
­economy approaches have broadened to include, among 
other things, studies of those who are ‘marginalized’, 
including geographies of rural women, the young, the old 
and those in poverty, for example. There have also been 
a number of more contemporary geographies exploring, 
among other things, rural sexuality, feminism, travel-
lers and those who, because of dominant cultural con-
structions of the countryside (in the United Kingdom at 
least), have been severely ‘othered’ (Little and Leyshon 
2003; Woods 2010, 2012). Finally, there has been a shift in 
the ANAA tradition towards the exploration and promo-
tion of ‘alternative’ and ‘ethical’ rural and agricultural 
production networks and sustainable rural livelihoods in 
both the global North and South, including fair trade, 
organic projects and geographical indications, for exam-
ple (see Spotlight box 11.2).
Linking the new cultural rural geography and political 
economy rural studies is an important challenge (Argent 
Indeed, rural studies are increasingly interdisciplinary 
(see, for example, the leading academic journal in this 
area, Journal of Rural Studies). Rural geographies of the 
poor world have been treated very differently and have 
tended to be conflated with development studies: thus, 
notwithstanding research in Latin America on the Nueva 
Ruralidad there is relatively little cultural geography of 
the rural global South (see Kay 2008; Murray 2008).
Early geography paid some attention to rural areas but 
this declined with the quantitative revolution and the rise 
of spatial science in the 1960s. Rural geography at this 
time was essentially agricultural geography, as ‘rural’ and 
‘agricultural’ were – for good empirical reasons – more 
explicitly interchangeable at the time. Rural geography 
made something of a comeback in the 1970s and early 
1980s, and during this period the sub-discipline could be 
described as ‘functionalist’, concerned with such issues as 
rural planning, land use change and urban encroachment. 
In hindsight, this approach can be seen as ‘uncritical’ and 
theory-free. The relevance of such rural geography was 
questioned in terms of its contribution to broader society 
in the late 1980s. Some also argued that by focusing on 
the distinctiveness of the countryside it ignored processes 
that cut across the increasingly blurred rural–urban 
divide (Woods 2010).
By the early 1990s, in the ANAA tradition, there 
was resurgence in rural geography based on concepts 
from political economy. This focused in particular on 
a critique of the role of the ‘restructuring’ impacts of 
­globalization and – although not referred to as such 
then – neoliberalism. This approach saw the applica-
tion of concepts from neo-Marxist and world systems 
perspectives and was focused on how circuits of capital 
across the world conditioned, and were conditioned by, 
the nature of rural space in different locations and how 
the state intervened in such flows. Some such concepts 
have been applied to agriculture in the South, particularly 
commodity and value chain analysis, although not always 
under the title of rural ‘geography’. Themes considered 
during this period included diversification, environmental 
change, international food chains and deregulation, as 
well as attempts, in later forms at least, to bring together 
social and political issues with economic concerns (Cloke 
2005a). The latter included work on commodification, 
gentrification, accessibility and counterurbanization. 
Much of the work in this area, particularly in agri-food 
systems, has continued until the present. Indeed one 
might argue that in New Zealand and Australia emphasis 
has remained on the political economy of agriculture and 
on the impacts of globalization, and has not shifted to 
cultural interpretations to the extent that it has in the UK 
(Argent 2002). Furthermore, across the world traditional 
land use studies remain popular; Chilean, Peruvian and

out of neoliberalism, and shifting cultures in rural areas. 
These shifts have been configured in very different ways 
across space but, in general terms, depopulation in the 
countryside has been an almost universal trend since the 
industrial revolution in the global North, and since the 
export of industrial-led growth models after the Sec-
ond World War in the global South. Table 11.1 shows  
that whilst absolute world rural population rose from  
1.7 billion to over 3.36 billion between 1950 and 2014, 
in relative terms it declined, falling from 71 per cent to 
46 per cent of the total global population.
Table 11.1 also shows the breakdown of rural 
­population by region, illustrating that in a proportional 
sense Africa is the most ‘rural’ – with levels of over  
60 per cent – followed by Asia with 52 per cent. Looking 
at regional data at this scale often hides important varia-
tions – for example, Oceania includes the highly urbanized 
countries of Australia and New Zealand, as well as rela-
tively rural Pacific Island countries such as Vanuatu, Solo-
mon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Tonga. Overall, 
however, it is clear that there is a significant North/South 
divide in terms of the demographic rural/urban dichot-
omy; in the richer countries there are just over 275 ­million 
rural inhabitants, representing approximately 22 per cent 
of the total population, whilst in the South there are 
over 3 billion rural inhabitants, accounting for just over  
52 per cent of the total population at the present time.
Since the Industrial Revolution the relative loss of 
population in the countryside in the global North has 
proceeded as national economies became based first on 
industry and then services, both of which are generally, 
though not exclusively, concentrated in urban areas. 
This population loss has commonly been highly selec-
tive, often taking the young and sometimes the skilled, 
leaving depleted labour markets and service provision 
(see Plate 11.6). Indeed, as noted above, rural popula-
tions across the world are both ageing and in relative 
decline. Rates of urbanization are most rapid by far in 
the global South, while the level of urbanization remains 
low compared to the West. The most rapid rates of rela-
tive rural population decline, then, are found in poorer 
regions of the planet, which has significant and generally 
deleterious consequences for the rural society left behind  
as well as to the swelling urban populations which they 
are augmenting.
There have been some exceptions to the rule of relative 
rural depopulation and one of the most studied demo-
graphic processes in the global North has been coun-
terurbanization. In the 1970s in the USA, for example, 
fuelled by rising net in-migration, smaller towns grew at 
a more rapid pace than larger ones, reversing the histori-
cal trend in urbanization towards large agglomerations. 
In the 1980s and early 1990s in the United Kingdom 
2002; Philips 2002). Furthermore, building in empirical 
and theoretical input from geographers in areas other 
than the United Kingdom and the United States is also 
very important. Most rural dwellers live outside the 
countries where the global rural geography agenda is set, 
and in conditions that are very different to those found 
there. In this regard, more research on the rural geogra-
phy of poorer territories and regions is required (Mur-
ray 2008). Overall, the important thing to remember is 
that numerous traditions in rural geography coexist and 
that ‘paradigms’ or perspectives never neatly succeed one 
another; communicating across and between these rural 
world-views is a central challenge for human geographers 
in general.
11.3 Shifting rural worlds
In what follows we will consider geographical change in 
rural demographies, polities, cultures and economies. 
Relative weight is placed on the latter two categories, 
although this does not mean that they are more signifi-
cant than other areas. Processes that operate in any one 
of these spheres interact in various ways with processes 
in others, just as rural areas are bound together as one 
global network.
Rather than considering the global North and South 
separately, examples from each and the links between 
them are emphasized within this framework. The forces 
that cut across these boundaries can be summarized as 
modernization (see modernity in the glossary) (includ-
ing increased urbanization and industrialization), and 
its latest incarnates, neoliberalism, retroliberalism and 
globalization (see Murray and Overton 2015). These pro-
cesses fall unevenly in different places, given local his-
tories and respective positions in the global system. As 
global divisions of labour spread further across the planet 
and borders become increasingly permeable, rural and 
agricultural spaces in very different places form constitu-
ent parts of an evolving global network of rural spaces. 
As such, land use and identity and all other aspects of 
rural change in the North must be seen as intimately tied 
to changing socio-economic, environmental and cultural 
ruralities in the South.
11.3.1 Dynamic rural demographies
Rural demographies across the world are highly dynamic. 
This demographic change has been conditioned, to vary-
ing extents, by generally increasing levels of urbanization, 
the diversification of the economic base of the country-
side away from agriculture combined with the rolling

Cardiff re-located to villages and small towns across the 
county. The real and perceived diseconomies of scale 
of large cities as well as changes in the nature of work 
and private mobility led to this outcome. Cultural shifts 
also influence this demographic change. As people have 
tired of the costs inherent in urban living, such as con-
gestion, pollution and social distance, some have sought 
out the idyll of rural life, closer community, and many 
other stereotypes that abound regarding the countryside 
in the global North. In New Zealand and Australia the 
rise of the ‘lifestyle block’, an acre or two of land in the 
countryside where the ‘good life’ can be practiced, within 
commuting distance of a large city, is a growing phenom-
enon. In the United Kingdom ‘barn conversions’ are the 
outcome of similar processes albeit in a more densely 
populated context (see Plate 11.7).
The universality of counterurbanization in the global 
North has been called into question and some see it 
as very time- and place-specific: related to a period of 
manufacturing and service decentralization in Europe 
and USA that took place in the 1970s and early 1980s 
especially. Countries that have experienced periods of 
growth in the proportion of the total population living 
in rural areas include Germany (1970–85), United King-
dom (1950–70), Finland (marginally from 1980 onwards) 
and Australia (1975–90) (United Nations 2006). There 
has been a clustering of relative rural population gain in 
Central and Eastern Europe since 1990 in places including 
Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia, Romania, Czech Republic and 
smaller settlements and some rural areas experienced 
growth whilst inner cities recorded net losses. Hereford, 
an agricultural centre in the west of England located on 
the Welsh border, became the fastest growing settlement 
in the country in the late 1980s, for example. There were, 
and still are, visible manifestations of urban to rural 
migration in Herefordshire as a whole, including ‘barn-
conversions’ and small rural housing estates as working 
populations from cities such as Birmingham, Bristol and

detect smaller regional units of buoyant rural population 
growth based on migration patterns. This shift is influ-
enced by urban-to-rural migration among certain groups 
and changes the nature of rural areas in a variety of ways. 
Some rural areas, particularly those close to larger urban 
settlements, have become effectively dormitory zones. 
When in-migrant populations in the rural United King-
dom – characterized inherently by high mobility – bypass 
local services such as small shops, local pubs, health clinics 
and small hospitals, post-offices and railway stations, the 
impact on the socio-cultural nature and economic base of 
rural areas can be dramatic. The influx of urban migrants 
in some areas has occasionally led to tensions between the 
existent and in-migrant population, in terms of how rural 
settlements are governed and managed. Through the 1970s 
and 1980s, Welsh nationalists, in response to the perceived 
‘invasion’, burnt a number of holiday homes purchased by 
non-Welsh newcomers, for example. Interestingly, however, 
studies in the United Kingdom have shown that social col-
lectives, such as playgroups, village football teams, local 
fitness groups and creative activities such as orchestras (as 
in the case of my own home village of Tarrington in Here-
fordshire) have been characterized by high participation by 
in-migrants, clearly keen to illustrate their commitment to 
their new home and live out the imagined community spirit 
that some might seek. Cloke (2005b) argues that differing 
densities of population and territorial size lead to differ-
ent impacts with respect to the processes outlined above. 
In the United Kingdom, for example, rural areas that are 
subject to immigration effectively become suburbs. This is 
contrasted to the situation in the USA, Australia and, to 
an extent, New Zealand, where the migratory ‘footprint’ 
of any given city will be relatively dispersed. Again what 
should be clear from this discussion is that there are vari-
able outcomes across global rural space.
The demographic processes at work and outcomes in 
the rural areas of the global South are, generally speak-
ing, very different to those outlined in the preceding 
discussion, although the theme of rural depopulation in 
terms of the proportion of total population living in rural 
areas is a common one. As already noted, this process is 
generally much more rapid in poorer countries in terms 
of absolute rates of migration. Although rural–urban 
drift has ebbed and flowed in different places at different 
times, this shift has become one of the defining features 
of social change in the South over the past decades, lead-
ing to the abandonment of rural areas in extreme cases 
(Plate 11.8) and the explosion of urban populations in 
receiving areas. Latin America has seen a particularly 
marked rural depopulation over the past 50 years in pro-
portional terms, for example, as has the Pacific Island 
region, which in many cases has seen the rise of inter-
national rural to urban migration (see Case study 11.1).
also Russia, for example. However, in many countries – 
including Spain, Holland, Belgium, Canada, Sweden and 
New Zealand, for example – net counterurbanization has 
not occurred at all at a national scale, although there are 
many examples of urban to rural migration, they have 
not outweighed the reverse. Outside of Europe there are 
virtually no examples of relative rural population gain 
over the past 60 years, except in some very small coun-
tries or small island nations. However, the rural–urban 
drift has slowed in the global North; the rate of decline 
in rural population slowed from rates of 1.35 per cent per 
annum in the period 1950–55 to 0.66 per cent between 
the years 2005 and 2010, and declined further by 2014 
(United Nations 2009 and 2014c). Rural depopulation is 
undoubtedly the dominant pattern in richer countries, 
albeit at lower rates than previously, particularly as inner 
cities are rejuvenated and people appear to be seeking 
settlement closer to their place of work (see Chapter 9). 
Recently, the rise of Internet communications has led 
some to suggest that a new process of counterurbaniza-
tion could well be imminent, as people can increasingly 
locate at a distance from their place of employment. 
Whilst possible in theory, such technology does not obvi-
ate the essential human need to meet face to face and 
such a process relates to only certain kinds of tertiary and 
quaternary activities and is therefore socially-selective; to 
date there is no evidence that cyber-technology is revers-
ing rural depopulation anywhere on the planet.
Although counterurbanization is not a worldwide 
phenomenon, representing a fascinating yet ultimately 
unimportant diversion from the principal trend of rural 
depopulation, there is no doubt that the social structure of 
the rural population in the global North is shifting because 
of demographic change. When one looks below the scale 
of the whole nation-state, it has often been possible to

234    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
Case study 11.1 
Rural depopulation in the  
Pacific Islands: Niue
Niue provides a good example of rural depopulation 
in the global South. Niue is a very small island nation 
with a population of close to 1,500. Although Alofi, 
its capital, is defined as an urban area, functionally 
and demographically it is rural, being low-density and 
dominated by subsistence agricultural production. 
From a peak of 5,000, this rural island has been losing 
population since the 1960s, a process which acceler-
ated when the colonial power from 1901, New Zealand, 
offered dual citizenship for Niueans on independence 
in 1974. Owing to a mixture of cyclones, environmental 
degradation, and misguided economic development 
policy, the islanders have moved consistently and in 
very high relative numbers to the cities of New Zea-
land, especially Auckland, and to a lesser extent to 
Australia. This loss has its positive side – remittances 
sent back from Niuean migrants, often second and third 
generation, form part of the backbone of the country’s 
economy, with over 50 per cent of GDP accounted for 
by such flows, with much of the rest of national income 
accounted for by aid flows (Murray and Overton 2014).
Unlike remittance-based migration from some rural 
areas to urban areas in the South, this case is not cir-
cular in its nature: it is largely permanent. However, this 
loss of population means that Niue is the most rapidly 
depopulating rural zone and country in the world. The 
consequences of this demographic shift have been dev-
astating: services in retail and transport have declined 
as they become uneconomic; whole settlements have 
been abandoned leaving empty shells where once 
were houses; and the country’s agriculture suffers from 
severe labour shortages (Plate 11.9). After the devastat-
ing cyclone Heta in late 2004, some on the right-wing of 
New Zealand politics asked whether the country could 
survive and at what point it should be declared unviable. 
The disappearance of the rural society on the island 
of Niue would deny the world a unique and fascinating 
culture that contributes to the world’s human diversity. A 
similar story is true across many of the Pacific Islands 
such as Rapa Nui, Samoa, Wallis and Futuna, Tuvalu 
and Tokelau, as rural population is lost to the process of 
both intra- and transnational urbanization (Murray and 
Terry 2004; Connell 2008; Overton and Murray 2014).

this has been coupled with severe environmental decline 
because of over-exploitation, rapid commercialization or 
climate change. Severe drought has increased over recent 
years in the sub-Saharan rural zones, for example, lead-
ing to a rise in rural–urban drift. Under such conditions, 
political circumstances, including wars, and neoliberal 
and retroliberal economic policies such as export ori-
entation, have often aggravated environmental tensions 
leading to full-scale food shortages and famine. Prob-
lems in rural areas in the South are made all the more 
significant when one considers that despite rapid relative 
population loss, the largest absolute rural populations 
are found in poor countries and this is set to be the case 
in the foreseeable future. Table 11.2 shows the largest ten 
rural populations by country in 2014, projected into 2050, 
with the USA being the only country in the global North 
featuring on the list.
11.3.2 Dynamic rural polities
Political power in the countryside in both the global 
North and South is shifting considerably in terms of 
how it is gained and exercised. As such, the governance 
of rural spaces is increasingly complex and contested. In 
Northern countries, rural areas have traditionally been 
over-represented in parliamentary politics, owing in part 
to the inherited importance of the landed elite in national 
affairs of state as well as the desire of some democratic 
governments to escape accusations of urban bias. Within 
the countryside itself this created space for various coun-
tryside interest groups, alliances, political parties and 
social movements that draw on particular imaginaries 
of the countryside to make their case. In New ­Zealand, 
for example, a small political party – the Outdoor Rec-
reation Party NZ – won 1.3 per cent (approximately 
A number of factors explain this rural–urban drift in 
the South, with the weight of each varying from place to 
place. Generally speaking, the move abroad of transna-
tional corporations (TNCs) beginning in the 1960s, the 
increasing mobility of capital from the 1980s onwards, and 
the concomitant rise in industrial employment, together 
with development theory and policy that promotes mod-
ernization (i.e. industrial urban development) as beneficial 
and desirable, have combined to precipitate this outcome 
(Potter et al. 2008). The process has been aggravated by the 
legacy of unequal landholding structures in rural areas, 
where peasant farmers often exist side by side with large 
landowners sometimes directly descended from colonial 
elites. The simultaneous commercialization of agriculture 
and de-agrarianization of national economies has often led 
to fewer opportunities for small-scale producers, as larger 
producers have access to the credit and collateral required 
to purchase the technology in order to compete. Thus 
smaller producers have either lost their land to become 
temporary labourers on large farms or have migrated 
to the city – leading to what is known as proletarianiza-
tion in the case of the former, and de-peasantization in 
the case of the latter (Murray 2006). There are instances 
when this rural population decline has been stopped or 
even reversed, as is the case in the Monte Patria comuna 
(district) of northern Chile during the peak years of the 
grape export boom in the early 1990s and is now the case in 
the rapidly expanding wine export regions of the Central 
Valley (Overton and Murray 2011). In some cases in places 
as diverse as Peru, Fiji and Sarawak, Malaysia the rise of 
rural tourism has led to localized rural population growth, 
but overall this is not common.
In short, rural areas in poorer countries have become 
increasingly less attractive economically and socially and 
a large-scale drift to the cities has occurred. In some cases

(UNASUR) and the Southern African Development Com-
munity (SADEC), have historically seen this as a form of 
protectionism, allowing the continuance of subsidized 
agriculture in richer countries. At the same time that such 
support persists, global financial institutions insist on 
the adoption of free-market, non-subsidized, neoliberal 
policies in poorer countries, a situation that discriminates 
against millions of rural inhabitants.
In the global South the practice of modernist devel-
opment has often been described as ‘urban biased’ (Kay 
2001). The persistent neglect of rural development initia-
tives in favour of industrial urban policy has been writ-
ten about widely and consistently, most notably in Africa 
and Latin America. In the latter, rural zones have been 
neglected by administrations that have been over-central-
ized, partly a consequence of a legacy of urban-based 
Hispanic society, and partly the result of the opening 
of economies to foreign capital which exploits cheap 
labour pools in urban areas during the recent phase of 
neoliberalism and subsequent retroliberalism. There are 
numerous examples of rural resistance to the neoliber-
alization of rural areas and its associated urban bias in 
places as diverse as Thailand, Fiji and Brazil. One of the 
most notable examples is that of the Zapatistas in Chia-
pas, Southern Mexico (Murray and Overton 2014). This 
movement was very influential in terms of the rise of the 
anti-globalization groups that characterized the early 
2000s and the group remains powerful in popular culture 
today, evidenced in Mexican singer/musician Lila Downs’ 
recent song ‘Zapata sigue’ which celebrates the dynamic 
and complex rural Mexican culture linked to the figure of 
Zapata and the uprising in Southern Mexico. Despite rises 
in commodity agro-exports, effective control of resources 
still remains in urban areas, resulting in a process of what 
could be called internal colonialism. Rural dwellers in the 
South have to endure the double impact of over-central-
ized and urban-biased governments, and the economic 
control of large corporations based in capital cities or, 
often, outside of the borders of the country itself.
There are also examples of resistance to ‘modern-
ist’ rural production methods in the South by popula-
tions in the global North. Participation in alternative 
food networks, organic supply chains, local economic 
trading schemes, slow food networks, localized farmer 
markets/food miles movements and fair trade linkages 
as forms of opposition have become significant, on the 
fringes of the modernist production and consumption 
networks of the North. Some, however, have conceptu-
alized alternative projects as just part of neoliberalism, 
controlled by powerful multinational retail conglomerates 
or bodies that serve their interests, where ‘alternatives’ are 
mainstreamed quickly in order to protect the capitalist 
status quo. However, fair trade NGOs and the Fairtrade 
25,000) votes in the 2002 general election on a platform 
of ‘preserving’ rural areas for hunting and fishing as well 
as broader rural-first policies and as a consequence of this 
success was integrated into a larger party – the United 
Future – in subsequent elections. The Countryside Alli-
ance in the United Kingdom is another case. With the 
motto ‘love the countryside’, the movement was formed 
in 1997 and grew rapidly in reaction to the single issue 
of the proposed ban on fox-hunting contained in the 
Labour Party 2001 election manifesto. The movement 
soon mushroomed to include a range of disgruntled rural 
groups who argued that central government was increas-
ingly over-interventionist in rural affairs. The Alliance 
argues that over 100,000 individuals are members. The 
movement culminated in a massive march on UK Parlia-
ment in October 2002 involving approximately 400,000 
people. The imagined conflict between city and country 
– ­traditional and modern, and ‘authentic’ and ‘fake’ – was 
invoked in speeches during the march. Many groups that 
are truly marginalized in the countryside, such as travel-
lers for example, were not represented to the same extent 
as the ‘sport’ of fox-hunting. This has led some to argue 
that the Alliance was a smokescreen erected by the elite, 
utilizing stereotypical interpretations of the countryside, 
to push a single issue pertinent to them, whilst drawing 
in support from the rural masses (see Woods 2005 for a 
discussion). Casting the particularities of the situation 
to one side, what is interesting is the way the Alliance 
used ‘imaginaries’ of the countryside in order to pursue a 
­specific political point. It is also clear that these imaginar-
ies – of fox-hunting and hounds and red suits on horses 
– are not necessarily shared, or even considered desirable, 
by the majority in the countryside in the United Kingdom.
But representations of the rural for political gain are 
not just made from within the countryside itself: argu-
ments about rural identity are sometimes invoked in order 
to make broader political gains. Countries in the Euro-
pean Union, especially France, have used arguments con-
cerning the importance of ‘rurality’ to make the case for 
the maintenance of subsidies for agriculture, organized 
broadly under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 
since 1962, claiming that such funds help sustain the life-
styles and landscapes that make a broader contribution to 
the character of the European countryside. More recently, 
European governments have couched this argument in 
terms of the protection of the ‘multifunctionality’ (see 
also later discussion) of the countryside; that is to say, sus-
taining agriculture has positive knock-on effects in other 
areas (such as environmental preservation, for example) 
that others in broader society also value. Governments of 
the South, articulated through the G77 and the World 
Trade Organization (WTO) as well as various regional 
groupings such as the Union de Naciones Suramericanos 

Chapter 11  Changing rural worlds – a global view     237
The foregoing trends have influenced the cultural con-
sumption of the countryside and the allied commodifica-
tion of the rural experience. In the global North, rural 
imaginaries are used to sell things. When objects, traits 
and ideas of a particular culture are brought into capi-
talist circuits, or when new traits are invented in order 
to stimulate economic gain, ‘cultural commodification’ 
can be said to be occurring. Increasingly, ‘cosmopolitan 
consumers’ seek out ‘authentic’ experiences that will help 
them differentiate themselves from the masses. There are 
further examples across the ‘cultural’ economy – ‘world’ 
music, poverty tourism, ‘ethnic’ food aisles in supermar-
kets, cultural quarters: Chinatown, Little India and the 
like – established in cities as diverse as San Francisco, 
­Singapore, London, Cape Town, Rio de Janeiro and 
Auckland (see Chapter 13). Although the flow of cultural 
items from the periphery to the core was initiated ­during 
Western imperial times, there can be little doubt that 
there is a growing tendency towards the consumption of 
‘the Other’ in richer markets facilitated by globalization 
(see Chapter 19).
In the case of rural areas, cultural commodification 
has been especially important. This is most obvious in 
the advertising world, which uses rural references in order 
to sell products that have little or nothing to do with the 
countryside. For example, the advertising campaign for 
Speights Beer in New Zealand involves images of typical 
rural South Island men who are tough in outlook and pio-
neering in spirit. As heroes they are spurred on by the taste 
of Speights beer, which allegedly gives them energy, and 
which they prefer above all ‘urban’ temptations (such as a 
box at Eden Park rugby ground, the main stadium home 
of the All Blacks, in one advert). The good-humoured 
rivalry between North and South Islands of New Zealand, 
which is a proxy for urban and rural in some ways, is used 
to sell a product that ‘real men’ drink. In reality, most Spei-
ghts beers are brewed in Auckland, located in the northern 
part of the country – a large urban conglomeration much 
like any other, far away both territorially and culturally 
from much of the South Island.
There is also a trend towards ‘place-making’ in rural 
areas across the global North, for the purposes of creat-
ing niche products, including tourism. This involves tak-
ing a trait, or inventing one, which is characteristic of a 
locality and using this for economic gain – another term 
for this is fictive place (see Overton and Murray 2016). 
Ludlow, in the English county of Shropshire, for example, 
has reinvented itself as one of the principal gourmet desti-
nations in the country based on the coincidental location 
there of a number of top restaurateurs in the 1990s. This 
has created a hub of restaurants, cafés, wine bars and 
tea shops, which bears little relevance to the ‘authentic’ 
history of this small medieval rural town which grew up 
labelling bodies themselves maintain that consumers can 
play an important role in terms of caring at distance that 
can make a difference to rural spaces in poorer countries. 
McCarthy (2006), however, argued that to date alternative 
ethical networks had done little to alter existing North–
South dynamics and power remains largely concentrated 
in the former. Research efforts are being undertaken in this 
area and will reveal more clues as to the impact of such 
networks in the coming years (see Spotlight box 11.2).
11.3.3 Dynamic rural cultures
Traditional rural cultures are being altered profoundly by 
the shifting relationship between the urban and the rural, 
although what is meant by ‘traditional’ is contested. As 
noted previously, the increasing intermingling of urban 
and rural processes and populations raises questions as to 
what is meant by ‘rural’ at all. Indeed some have argued 
that the concept of rurality exists only in the mind and 
that the ‘binary’ of rural and urban is a false one. Thus, 
as noted previously, rural social space and rural territo-
rial space are not necessarily the same thing and therefore 
‘rurality’ is something that has to be deconstructed. Some 
have even argued that we have reached a ‘post-rural’ con-
dition in that pure rurality no longer exists, if it ever did. 
Cultural geographers have been hard at work trying to 
tease out the way that meanings of rurality are perceived 
by different actors in the global North (but relatively 
­little in the South) and how this affects socio-cultural and 
­economic behavior and patterns.
Postmodernists argue that much of the contemporary 
world is simulacrum where symbols or signifiers of an 
event replace direct experience. Reality is thus experi-
enced through representations of it, creating a ‘hyper-
reality’ that is disembedded from territorial space. It has 
been argued, based largely on evidence from the UK, that 
this has occurred in the case of the perception of the rural 
by some urban dwellers who wish to experience the ‘rus-
tic’ and the relatively ‘untouched’, which they imagine to 
be associated with the countryside. This might include: 
wearing country clothes, driving large four-wheel-drive 
all-terrain vehicles around city streets, designing the inte-
rior of their homes like country cottages, and so on. It 
could be argued that many people who live in the rural–
urban fringe extend this hyper-reality to their everyday 
existence. The idea that we are in a post-rural condition 
takes the argument too far, however, and certainly does 
in the case of the global South where such notions are at 
best irrelevant and, at worst, fanciful, elitist and damag-
ing. As such and in general, the cultural meanings associ-
ated with the rural have caused a shift in the relationship 
between society and geographical space, and between 
culture and nature (see Chapter 12).

238    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
rural areas. In New Zealand, in the area around Rotorua 
(central North Island), there are numerous ‘authentic’ 
Maori villages that have been developed for tourists to 
visit and experience indigenous culture. In New Zea-
land’s leading tourist destination, Queenstown, in an 
area not intensively settled by Maori historically, there 
is a strong tourist-based ‘Maori experience’ on offer at 
various performances locations throughout the town. 
Today, most Maori live in urban areas and their lifestyle 
is far removed from the hyper-reality and fictive place 
depicted in such locations, but such businesses provide 
an important source of income for those involved, includ-
ing many Maori who lead the groups that perform haka 
(dance) and waiata (song). Cultural commodification 
has the potential to bring economic gains but it can also 
straightjacket places into fossilized cultural representa-
tions, leading to the creation of damaging stereotypes. 
Notwithstanding this, some have argued that such ven-
tures help maintain traits of Maori culture that might 
otherwise die out, thereby rejuvenating rural indigenous 
culture.
In the rural global South cultural issues are very differ-
ent. Rural cultures are, of course, vibrant and enormously 
varied. Given that the vast majority of rural dwellers on 
earth live in the global South this variety is kaleidoscopic. 
In some cases ‘national’ culture is rooted in traditional 
and conservative imaginaries of the rural (see Plate 11.1), 
although this culture is sometimes fossilized and invented. 
Notwithstanding this, very little is known of the rural 
cultural geography of the South, and human geography 
in the North has tended to ignore it. There is a rich tradi-
tion of anthropology of rural areas in the Third World, 
but this tends to focus on the unusual rather the everyday 
cultures of the rural poor. In some post-colonial territo-
ries rural areas are often home to ‘indigenous’ cultures, or 
based around its castle built to defend from and further 
penetrate that part of the British Celtic fringe now known 
as Wales. In New Zealand, Taihape has pronounced itself 
‘gumboot’ (wellington boot) capital of the world, has an 
annual world gumboot throwing competition, and has 
erected statues and opened tearooms to celebrate this 
(Plate 11.10)! Towns that have been bypassed by the 
establishment of large highways turn this to their advan-
tage by advertising the ‘best of rural life’ on large high-
way billboards to attract weary travellers, as in the case 
of Marton, New Zealand. Alexandra in Central Otago, 
New Zealand, has recreated the original settlers’ rural 
township in order to stimulate the tourist demand for 
authentic rural experiences, and there are many similar 
examples across Anglo settler societies such as the USA, 
Canada and Australia. These examples illustrate attempts 
to use rural imaginaries to create diversified livelihoods in 
areas where traditional agricultural production patterns 
are rapidly restructuring. In such efforts culture, invented 
or otherwise, plays an important economic role.
A phenomenon linked to cultural consumption is 
the creation of rural spectacle in order to market place 
(Cloke 2005b). The construction of ‘fresh’ and ‘natu-
ral’ experiences is important in this respect. Adventure 
tourism in New Zealand and Australia – including white 
water rafting, bungee jumping and zorbing, for ­example 
– is an interesting example of how rural areas have recon-
figured their economic bases. At Kiwi 360 near to Tau-
ranga, New Zealand, it is possible to visit orchards, take 
part in activities and tour a museum to kiwi fruit pro-
duction. The multiple connotations of the word ‘kiwi’ 
– which refers to a native flightless bird, a fruit, and often 
used to describe a New Zealander – are clearly used in 
marketing such rural spectacles. Related to the concept 
of rural spectacle is the evolution of cultural visits to

The hidden others of the countryside
As mentioned previously, researching the ‘hidden oth-
ers’ of the countryside in the West has now become 
more important in the ANAA geographical tradition. 
This research has revealed a darker underside to the 
rural idyll where people are excluded because of vari-
ous identity traits or socio-economic characteristics. 
Work has been undertaken on travellers, marginalized 
sexualities, the unemployed, the elderly and the poverty-
stricken, for example. Poverty in the countryside in the 
West can be disturbingly high, and this has been particu-
larly the case as the economic base has rapidly restruc-
tured over the past two decades under neoliberalism. 
In New Zealand, for example, the neoliberal restructur-
ing of the 1980s and 1990s led to the closure of many 
small- and medium-scale dairy reception plants, as the 
New Zealand Dairy Board (later Fonterra) rationalized 
its operation geographically. This, together with other 
rural economic shifts, led to very high levels of poverty 
in some rural regions such as Taranaki and the East 
Coast, rural decline and depopulation, and some unin-
tended consequences such as the closure of rural rugby 
clubs, further undoing the social and cultural fabric of 
the countryside (Willis 2001). Despite limited state inter-
vention it has proven impossible for many such areas 
to regain dynamism, and pockets of poverty, crime and 
work-poor cultures in small rural towns such as Patea 
and Waverley remain stubbornly present to this day.
One of the ironies is that many recent countryside 
movements and alliances, such as those discussed 
in a preceding section, represent anything but such 
disadvantaged groups in the case of the global North, 
although the involvement of all classes in often elitist 
causes is frequently solicited in order to create the 
impression of a ‘rural consensus’.
circa 400,000) might well still consider themselves as 
‘being of’ Taveuni, Ovalau, Tailevu or some other rural 
area and they will make this known very early on dur-
ing both formal ceremonial and informal conversational 
exchanges. Notwithstanding some continuity, there are 
also significant changes; the influence of urban Fijians 
that return to the village, temporarily or otherwise, is 
contested and often bemoaned by those who stay behind, 
as they bring with them concepts, such as property rights, 
individualism and capitalism, which hitherto were alien 
in such societies.
The marketization of the countryside in ways that 
increase tourism and niche products are relatively rarely 
practised in the global South, although it is possible to 
find increasing examples of exceptions to this rule. Wine 
tourism in rural Chile, for example, is growing in popular-
ity with the urban middle and upper classes who travel to 
the countryside locations such as the Colchagua and Cas-
ablanca Valleys to taste and buy wine on estates that recre-
ate the colonial hacienda period as a rural idyll and fictive 
place (Overton and Murray 2011). Similarly, there are 
small rural towns across Africa, Asia and Latin America 
that specialize in handicrafts for tourists. In Fiji resorts will 
often re-create a version of traditional rural life, includ-
ing meke (dance) and kava ceremonies, in the thatched 
roofed bures that characterize rural settlement for visit-
ing tourists. In rural Tonga, as across Polynesia, women 
make tapa, a beautifully decorated bark cloth which is 
traditionally used for ornate and ceremonial purposes, 
at least they were so before the onset of rural–urban drift. 
This raises particular issues with respect to rural develop-
ment planning in poorer countries. In Chile, for exam-
ple, many Mapuche – once one of the only unconquered 
indigenous group in Latin America – live in the south of 
the country in a marginalized economic and social envi-
ronment. Those Mapuche that have moved to the capital 
city have often fared no better in the urban context and 
have become, until very recently, almost invisible in the 
nation’s consciousness. Far from the buzzing and pri-
mate metropolis of Santiago, the rural Mapuche have, 
until recently at least, been left behind by the economic 
and political progress made in the country over the past 
25 years. In contrast to the global North, the experience 
of ‘rurality’ can be painful and poverty-stricken for such 
groups (see Spotlight box 11.1).
Across the Third World the peasantry is declining 
and this is leading to rapid change in the cultural life of 
rural dwellers. As neoliberalism unfolds, peasant farm-
ers and other small-scale producers are forced from their 
land and, as discussed previously, leave for the cities. In 
Fiji, despite leaving their homes, urban migrants from 
the countryside still retain much of their rural culture – 
although it is metamorphosing. Through the concept of 
Vanua indigenous Fijians are linked to the land; indeed 
they see themselves as indivisible from the land, and in 
particular the rural places they come from. Second- and

rural economic landscapes across the world. In order to 
understand this transition, below we consider ‘produc-
tivist’ agriculture, as well as newer concepts of ‘post-­
productive’ and ‘multifunctional’ rural spaces.
The contemporary agri-food system can be conceptual-
ized as a complex that stretches across continents, linking 
producers, consumers, supermarket retailers, and gov-
ernment policy makers among other agents, all of which 
represent nodes within commodity networks. Driving the 
agri-food system is agribusiness, which is associated with 
the industrialization and globalization of agriculture (Le 
Heron 1993). This has led to a shift in the nature of farm-
ing in many parts of the world involving a delocalization 
of activity and the creation of long networks, which see 
production oriented away from local and national markets 
and towards the global economy. The global agri-food net-
work has not led to the homogenization of rural space. 
At the same time as we witness the industrialization of 
agriculture, especially in parts of the global South, we 
are also seeing the rise of niche, organic and alternative 
agriculture particularly in the North. Furthermore, in 
places such as Latin America and South-east Asia where 
large-scale commercial and export-oriented agriculture is 
increasingly evident, we see the continued importance of 
full and semi-­subsistence farming.
Productivist rural economies
Productivist agriculture can be defined as the highly 
intensive production of a limited collection of primary 
commodities (McCarthy 2005). The agricultural sec-
tor has industrialized and commercialized, eclipsing 
non-capitalist agriculture. Agribusiness has expanded 
through vertical and horizontal integration, forming 
for sale at tourist markets in the capital Nuku’alofa. In 
rural Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) it is possible for for-
eign tourists to undertake longhouse (traditional com-
munal dwellings) visits. However, in general, agricultural 
production, combined with other diversified and off-farm 
– often precarious – livelihood forms, are the mainstay of 
such localities, and culture as a commodity usually plays 
a minor role unless it is invoked to make profit for large 
companies who might trade on such fictional notions. 
Notwithstanding, there has been a partial shift – at this 
stage minimal in impact – towards models of development 
that seek economic and cultural identity based progress 
simultaneously such as the Desarollo rural con identidad 
approaches favoured by some rural NGOs previously 
mentioned in Latin America. Geographical research is 
currently on-going as to whether such approaches deliver 
the holistic outcomes they might aspire to.
11.3.4	 Dynamic rural economies
In the past the economy of rural localities was essentially 
agricultural. The terms ‘rural’ economy and ‘agricultural’ 
economy are no longer interchangeable, however. In this 
section we look at how the rural and the agricultural have 
decoupled and what has replaced agricultural livelihoods, 
at least in part. This shift has arisen as the world econ-
omy has ‘de-agrarianized’, involving a large-scale shift 
away from agricultural to industrial and service activi-
ties. Increasingly, and particularly in the North, there is 
a tendency towards pluriactivity (diversified livelihoods) 
in rural areas (see Plate 11.12). However, diversification 
away from agriculture, viewed at the global scale, has 
been uneven, leading to the creation of very different

Researching ethical value chains – 
resistance to or perpetuation of  
global networks?
It is in response to the ill-effects of the globalized pro-
ductivist system that ‘ethical’ global value chains have 
evolved. The chains seek to link the South with the North 
in ways that do not undermine the social-economic 
viability of small-scale farmers, threaten environmental 
sustainability, and protect local cultures and identity. Fair 
trade, organic networks and geographical indications 
are three – often overlapping – value chains that have 
evolved in order to address these concerns respectively 
and in reaction to broader process of agricultural glo-
balization. Northern consumers and some of the elite 
in Southern territories are increasingly concerned with 
issues of justice, environment and identity related to the 
products they consume.
Geographical indicators (GIs) originate from Europe 
and were developed through the use of terroir in the 
French wine industry – that is, production that is dis-
tinct in a physical and cultural sense to the locality from 
which it emanates. Increasingly such strategies are 
being adopted and legalized in the South in a range of 
rural sectors including fruit, wine and fisheries. In Chile, 
for example, there are now over 20 products registered 
with an increasingly sophisticated GI system. There is 
often an element of fictive place in GIs as histories and 
cultures are moulded to fit marketing purposes. Not-
withstanding, the potential to protect local identities is 
clear. Organic networks are those which are certified as 
being environmentally sustainable by the proliferation 
of agencies that has evolved to serve this function. The 
marketing of this concept also evolves in the North, 
although farming has been largely ‘organic’ for millennia, 
until the rise of Fordist agriculture to feed growing urban 
populations and to fuel export markets.
Of the three overlapping ethical value chain (EVC) 
types, fair trade has perhaps captured the imagination 
the most as a potential way of delivering socio-eco-
nomic and cultural benefits to small-scale producers 
in the long networks that bring together the North and 
South. The system has evolved over the last 50 years, 
bringing to fruition a much longer heritage of charitable 
interactions led initially by church groups and building 
on the concept first proposed at the 1968 UNCTAD 
(United Nations Commission on Trade and Develop-
ment) that development required ‘trade not aid’. Over 
the last two decades it has grown considerably to now 
account for over €5.5 billion of trade. Although this is 
a minute proportion of the total agricultural commodity 
trade it does involve hundreds of countries in dozens of 
products. The largest traded product is coffee, followed 
by sugar and fruit. Suppliers from across Asia, Africa, 
but in particular Latin America, supply markets in the 
North – with the largest single ones being the UK, USA 
and Germany. A number of agencies have evolved to 
certify fair trade networks, the largest being Fairtrade 
international, which was established in 1997 with the 
amalgamation of a number of labelling systems. In 
essence, and across the various certifying bodies, to 
qualify collectives must be established that guarantee 
a price for growers over the medium term, offer access 
to credit, information and technological extension, and 
component of their operations to poorer countries. This 
is especially the case in fresh fruit, horticultural and flo-
ricultural sectors, resulting in a proliferation of counter-
seasonal exports to the Northern markets. As a network, 
for example, floriculture now generates over US$50 bil-
lion in sales per annum, and involves fresh-bloom sup-
ply from over 80 countries, as far flung as Ecuador and 
Kenya, most of which is channelled through the Nether-
lands to third countries in the rich world. Globalization 
has drawn Third World rural spaces into global capitalist 
circuits, yielding profound impacts. Export-oriented agri-
culture destined for the North has, in the case of Latin 
America, led to the evolution of monocultural localities 
which are extremely vulnerable economically, socially and 
environmentally (Murray and Overton 2014).
conglomerates that link the field to the supermarket. This 
has allowed companies to reduce the costs of transact-
ing, and internalize the risk of the inherently vulnerable 
business of farming. Consequently, agricultural sectors 
have increased in terms of ownership, and a new politi-
cal economy of agriculture based largely on monopoly 
capitalism and mass production has emerged. Some have 
referred to this as Fordist agriculture. Companies such 
as Monsanto, Nestlé, Fonterra, Cadbury’s and Bulmer’s 
are major players in this new economy.
Given the liberalization of the world economy from 
the 1970s onwards, agribusiness TNCs have increasingly 
invested abroad. Cheap labour and land as well as less 
strictly enforced environmental regulations provide incen-
tives for agribusiness TNCs to diffuse the production

invest a proportion of the profits on social projects in 
the localities involved. Producers must have a say in 
the structure and direction of the collectives and the 
allocation of the premium. There are many success 
stories and a visit to the website Fairtrade Interna-
tional (www.fairtrade.net) provides ample evidence 
of this. Recent work by the author in Chile uncovered 
a nascent yet very promising fair trade sector evolv-
ing in wine production, led by some of the industry’s 
established players but bringing in small-producers. A 
number of groups has evolved to stimulate this with 
collectives such as Ruta de Vino incorporating eco-
nomic as well as cultural goals, drawing not only on 
fair trade principles but also concepts related to GIs, 
and utilizing organic production.
There can be little doubt that fair trade has helped 
the lives of millions of farmers across the world and 
their families. However, the system is not perfect. It 
remains to be seen whether very marginal producers, 
the smallest and poorest, can hope to enter the sys-
tem. Little work has been done on the impacts on labour 
and only ongoing research will reveal the outcome. 
Recent unpublished research supervised by the author, 
by Heather Walker, Kelle Howson and Kellie Agazziz, 
has showed that in some communities in East Timor 
and Indonesia, small growers had little concept of the 
fair trade system and saw it much as any other com-
modity market (unpublished research). Furthermore, in 
the worst cases social premiums did not find their way 
to the farmers. The literature has identified problems, 
including eclipsing of justice issues by environmental 
issues, in-fighting between various labelling bodies, the 
problems surrounding the correct use of the social pre-
mium, discrimination against the least viable farmers, 
and regressive monopsony dominance by a single buyer 
(Murray and Overton 2014). Some economists argue 
that by artificially raising prices, fair trade is actually 
unfair to others not in the system and locks producers 
into commodity systems thereby perpetuating the initial 
rationale for intervention. These latter analyses go too 
far, fair trade and the EVC networks that they are part 
of are arguably a move in the right direction; however, 
they require careful monitoring and regulation in order 
to serve the purpose for which they were designed and 
to prevent them from being co-opted by powerful agro-
capitalist interests.
Case study 11.2 
Productivist agriculture in the 
­Hereford cider industry
In the 1980s rapid growth in the UK cider industry led 
to a fundamental restructuring of the Herefordshire 
economy as the largest global producer of cider – HP 
Bulmer’s – began an aggressive campaign to domi-
nate local supply networks and to secure the lucrative 
national market. The company purchased land from 
small-scale farmers and consolidated orchards in a way 
that allowed it to take full advantage of mechanized 
harvesting. At the same time it employed hundreds of 
medium-sized farmers on two-yearly contracts in order 
to shore up supply. Bulmer’s also took over a number 
of competing medium-sized cider producers including 
Symond’s (producer of Scrumpy Jack). This granted 
Bulmer’s a regional bilateral monopsony position 
(single buyer and seller simultaneously) in the county 
(and for many country miles beyond). Small-scale cider 
producers were out-competed, and the grubbing up 
of many old varieties of cider apples in place of the 
new mass-production bush-stock varieties accelerated 
the decline of small-scale farmhouse cider producers, 
thereby eroding diversity and choice.
The evolution of agribusiness has profound implica-
tions for local rural socio-economies in the global North 
as well. It has, for example, led to the relative decline of 
the family farm (Whatmore 1995) (see Case study 11.2). 
Furthermore, agribusiness has altered the rural landscape, 
removing hedges and practising other policies intended to 
capture economies of scale. Rural choices have also been 
impacted by the consolidation of agribusiness.
Post-productive agriculture and rural worlds
We are witnessing the return, in some places, of smaller-
scale agriculture, sometimes as a direct resistance to the 
globalization of agriculture. Simultaneously we can also 
observe the various uses of rural spaces intended to diver-
sify livelihoods and add ‘off farm’ components. These 
can be termed ‘post-productive’ rural landscapes where 
the goals, aside from maximizing agricultural yields, 
➜

Chapter 11  Changing rural worlds – a global view     243
include cultural commodification, optimizing ecological 
value, and stimulating niche-based agriculture.
The transition to post-productive agriculture is linked 
to the perceived costs and falling productivity of the glo-
balized model and the regulatory crisis it is facing. Gov-
ernment intervention is being rolled back, and large-scale 
production operating at a loss can no longer be tolerated. 
There is some evidence to suggest that the main bastion 
of productivist protectionism, the European Union’s 
Common Agricultural Policy, may be dismantled over the 
next decade or so. In this sense the transition to post-pro-
ductive agriculture is consistent with neoliberalism and 
cannot be seen as resistance to it. Indeed, if we view the 
evolution of this part of the system as the consequence of 
the farming-out of the labour- and land-intensive parts of 
the agri-food production complex to the periphery, then 
the rise of post-productivism forms part of the broader 
evolution of global capitalism.
In contrast to the above, some commentators see the 
rise of post-productive agriculture as indicative of resist-
ance to globalization, greater concern for the environ-
ment and the search for smaller scale, short network, 
sustainable and alternative food networks. Consumer 
demand has transformed Northern consumption pat-
terns, and food safety and quality issues also motivate 
elites in the South. This has led to a worldwide boom 
in organic farming as noted in Spotlight box 11.2 for 
example, that has impacted agricultural landscapes in 
the North and South. The short network approach can 
be seen as resistance to commodity production, with all 
of its inherent injustice and non-sustainability and as 
such is a further aspect of the ethical value chain system.  
Yet, arguably it undermines long network fair trade 
­systems – does replacing imports, and thus putting out 
of work producers, from the South lead to an unethical 
and unjust outcome viewed from the vantage point of 
the global society as whole? Are short networks moral 
alternatives or just localized protectionism?
In reality, we face a situation in rural worlds where 
a mixture of productivist and post-productivist func-
tions exist. At the global scale there is, of course, a divi-
sion of labour that sees much productivist agriculture 
located in poorer countries because of favourable loca-
tional comparative advantages, such as cheap land 
and labour, counterseasonality, and lax environmental 
regulations. Niche agriculture is undoubtedly becom-
ing more common in Northern countries. However, 
this dichotomy blurs a complex reality. In the United 
Kingdom post-productive activities in the countryside 
are advanced, but in places such as New Zealand, Aus-
tralia and the USA there is only limited evidence of a 
post-productive shift. New Zealand is considered one 
of the most cutting-edge of the agricultural economies 
but it is still heavily productivist, and because of a boom 
in demand from China large-scale dairy farming is in 
fact on the rise as more and more land is converted to 
dairy farming. In the global South the evidence for post-
productivism is even scarcer. There are some examples, 
such as the rise of wine tourism in Chile as noted, but 
in general we are seeing a shift towards productivism 
as neoliberalism is allowed to penetrate localities in the 
periphery. The rise of GM and its diffusion is likely to 
accentuate this trend. We thus have a significant North–
South divide in agriculture, and rural geography might 
do well to revisit older ideas including dependency and 
structuralism, in order to interpret these differentiated 
outcomes in the context of one global system.
Multifunctional rural worlds?
Post-productivism has been heavily criticized; use of the 
term is problematic because it makes assumptions about 
what is meant by ‘productivist’. The nature of productiv-
ist agriculture has varied, and still does vary across the 
world; it persists in some localities whilst in others it has 
never arrived, and probably never will. In places such as 
the Pacific Islands, subsistence agriculture plays a very 
important role in agricultural production and rural lives, 
and commercial networks bypass millions of rural dwell-
ers. Although modernist discourses might portray this as 
backward, the socio-cultural and nutritional role of sub-
sistence and semi-subsistence is critical. Yet agriculture of 
this nature is being squeezed by globalization.
In recognizing the problems associated with the con-
cept of post-productivism, the term ‘multifunctional’ 
has become employed in Northern rural studies. Wilson 
argues that the productivist debate has been ‘concep-
tualized from a UK-centric perspective that has largely 
failed to discuss whether the concept has applicability in 
Europe or beyond’ (2001: 77). Instead he suggests that the 
use of ‘multifunctional agricultural regimes’ is a better 
way to characterize the shifts that are occurring in Euro-
pean rural space. Multifunctionalism refers to the notion 
that ‘rural landscapes typically produce a range of com-
modity and non-commodity use values simultaneously 
and that policy ought to try and recognize and protect the 
entire range of values’ (McCarthy 2005: 774). It is argued 
that this concept is more useful than post-productivism 
as it offers a positive characterization: it recognizes the 
continued importance of commodity production and is 
sensitive to geographical difference.
Multifunctionalism implies that the countryside 
across the world is used for both productive and post-
productive purposes and that the combination of uses, 
including commodification and conservation, varies from 
place to place. Whilst this formulation reflects complex 

244    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
rural worlds much more accurately than previous con-
structions, it is also vulnerable to criticism. In some ways 
the concept says everything and nothing at the same time. 
Furthermore, commentators from the South have argued 
that its use in policy formation in the European Union, 
for example, is a disguised form of protectionism. As 
already noted, governments, particularly in France, have 
argued that subsidies to agriculture create positive social 
externalities by supporting other, often less tangible, 
functions of the countryside which help maintain ‘rural-
ity’. Meanwhile, poorer countries are expected to open 
their markets and perform the productivist element of 
the global agri-food complex. Indeed, it could be argued 
that there is a move away from multifunctionalism in the 
South, as monocultural neoliberalized sectors replace for-
merly diversified livelihoods.
11.4 Conclusion
‘Rural’ is a relative term; it shifts across time and space. 
It is also an enormously diverse category and therefore 
difficult to make generalizations about. It is increasingly 
difficult to define rural spaces, be they social or geo-
graphical. In both the South and North rural spaces are 
increasingly politicized, often in ways that move beyond 
‘normal’ electoral politics as new political movements 
abound. Rural identities have conditioned this political 
change and have themselves shifted in response to new 
social, economic and cultural configurations. Environ-
ments are threatened in all worlds because of neoliber-
alism and the rapid shift in the economic exploitation 
of rural areas. Certain constructions of rural culture 
and fictive places are used to sell the countryside and 
to represent its interests while ‘other’ cultures remain 
marginalized or are disappearing. In short, rural spaces 
are increasingly dynamic demographically, politically, 
­culturally, environmentally and economically. Rural 
geography has had to move swiftly in an attempt to 
­capture the complex changes and in the case of change 
in the South it has not kept pace.
This general shift, at the global level, has been influ-
enced by the unfolding of neoliberalism and globaliza-
tion. At the world scale, whilst it is true that rural spaces 
in the global North are becoming increasingly multifunc-
tional and are shifting away from ‘Fordist’ agriculture, in 
the South we are seeing an erosion of multifunctionality 
and pluriactivity overall. This is certainly the case where 
neoliberal agriculture penetrates and the diversified live-
lihood-sustaining activities that have often been built up 
over decades and centuries are eroded. These are dynamic 
times for rural spaces and populations all across the 
world, as the insecurities, socio-economic and environ-
mental, associated with the acceleration of globalization 
abound. This is especially the case in the South where 
neoliberal governance continues to run unrestrained 
despite some policy shifts to the contrary. Although rapid 
advances have been made in rural geography in and of the 
West, it is imperative that geographers turn attention to 
rural spaces of the South, which have so often borne the 
brunt of the evolution of global capitalism. Furthermore, 
by shifting focus in this way geographers can contribute 
to a more balanced and democratic human geography 
that is relevant to rural society as a whole and reflective 
of truly global change.

Chapter 12  Social constructions of nature    247
12.1 Questioning nature
The one thing that is not natural is nature.
(Soper 1995: 7)
What is nature? There is an easy answer. It is the birds 
and the bees, the plants and the landscapes around us – 
from the familiar things in our lives, like pet cats and 
dogs and the park at the end of the road, to more distant 
things that we see on television, like Amazonian rainfor-
ests and Giant Pandas. Nature is the set of things that are 
separate from humans. We have the social world on the 
one side, with its politics, injustices and cultural achieve-
ments, and on the other we have the natural world, a pre-
given set of biological entities – the domain of natural 
scientists – that have no politics and no culture . . . things 
that simply are.
Albert Einstein once quipped that ‘the environment 
is everything that isn’t me’. But is it really this simple? 
Can we draw lines between ourselves and the surround-
ing world so easily? The microbes that occupy our gut to 
the food like fruit and vegetables that we eat every day 
to sustain and reproduce ourselves suggest that it is hard 
to draw clear lines between our own bodies and the sur-
rounding environment. Food itself is far from natural. We 
use fertilizers, pesticides and mechanized agriculture to 
give nature a helping hand. Biologically, food represents 
the culmination of thousands of years of selective breed-
ing to create more productive plants and animals. In more 
recent times humans have created new organisms using 
genetic modification in laboratories. Bruce McKibben 
(1999) has taken this argument to its logical conclusion, 
arguing that it is impossible to find a part of the planet 
that has not been affected by humans in some way – even 
the remotest inland Antarctic ice sheets have trapped 
CO2 in them from industrial emissions. This observation 
leads him to argue that ‘nature’, in its traditional sense as 
something separate from and untouched by human soci-
ety, has now ended. Scientists are in agreement suggesting 
that the earth has entered a new geological time period 
called the Anthropocene (from the Greek word anthropos 
meaning humankind), in which humans are now the main 
drivers of environmental change (Zalasiewicz et al. 2011).
It is similarly hard to draw a line between human soci-
ety and nature at larger scales. Since our ancestor Homo 
erectus began using primitive tools some 1.9 million years 
ago, the history of human society has been one of envi-
ronmental transformation, culminating in the massive 
levels of urbanization that characterize the world today 
(see Chapters 1–3). With every technological advance, 
human society has learnt to adapt its surroundings to 
its own use. Over a hundred years ago Karl Marx tried 
to understand this process, suggesting that production is 
the critical force driving human interaction with nature:
Not only do the objective conditions change in the 
act of reproduction, e.g. the village becomes a town, 
the wilderness a cleared field etc., but the producers 
change, too, in that they bring out new qualities in 
themselves, develop themselves in production, trans-
form themselves, develop new powers and ideas, new 
modes of intercourse, new needs and new language.
(Karl Marx 1973, originally 1861, Notebook V)
This quote captures one of the fundamental argu-
ments of Marxist thought – that social development 
unfolds through the transformation of nature. From the 
basic work of a peasant clearing a field to the industrial 
exploitation of oil resources, economic production simul-
taneously transforms nature and society.
Perhaps nature existed before modern humans arrived 
on the scene then? Conservationists talk about ‘restor-
ing’ landscapes that have been spoilt by human activities 
to their natural condition. Environmentalists hark back 
to the natural conditions that existed before humans 
altered the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and biolo-
gists talk about how many more species there would be 
in the absence of humans. But when was this pre-human 
condition? For example, the dominant vegetation in 
pre-industrial Britain was temperate forest, and what is 
generally considered to be Britain’s ‘natural’ landscape is 
constituted by the species that typified this landscape, like 
oak trees. But if one goes back to the last glaciation some 
ten thousand years ago (when human impact was even 
less apparent, and thus the landscape it could be argued 
was even more ‘natural’) there was no forest, and no tem-
perate species existed in Britain (Birks 1997). Quintes-
sentially British species like oaks did not arrive until the 
end of the last ice age. Depending on what timescale is 
used they can be seen as either native to Britain, or as an 
invasive species. When we go back in time no historical 
cut-off is more valid than any other as the supposed point 
at which the environment was in a natural state.
12.1.1 The social construction of nature
So, if nature does not exist as something separate, and 
never really did, then what is it? Many academics have 
argued that instead of being a pre-given reality, nature is 
actually an idea, or a social construct, which varies for 
different people in different times and places. The phrase 
‘social construction’ was coined by sociologists Peter 
Berger and Thomas Luckmann (1966), who argued that 
humans establish meanings and truths through habits and 
institutions. So, for example, things like laws are social 
constructions because they have no essential existence 

248    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
that? If I then take that chemical formula and repre-
sent it to you as a tree, then you relate to it in a dif-
ferent way. Now, what’s nature? Is it all the molecules 
that make up the tree, or is it the tree? The point is that 
if you see a tree, you’ll react to it differently than you 
would if you saw a bunch of molecules, and if you see 
a tree in a habitat in a forest with a spotted owl sitting 
in it you would react very differently than if you just 
saw a tree.
(Harvey, in Banrffalo, 1996)
Plate 12.1 shows four representations of the same 
‘thing’. It is easy to argue that all are natural, and yet 
outside of the society in which people have decided to 
agree and act as if they exist – they are ‘social facts’.
Social constructionism recognizes that individuals 
and groups participate in the creation of their realities 
through the way in which they perceive things and events. 
Critically, it follows from this idea that various groups of 
people will interpret things and events differently, because 
their perception is coloured by their previous experiences 
and differing social norms. David Harvey gives a classic 
example of how this problem of perception can work in 
relation to nature:
What’s nature? What if I give you a chemical formula 
and say, how do you feel about your relationship to 
Plate 12.1  Carbon, tree, forest, wood.

the advent of mechanized production and better-yielding 
crop varieties, food supply has far outstripped popula-
tion growth. Despite an almost ten-fold increase in the 
number of people living on our planet since Malthus’s 
time, a greater proportion enjoy clean water today than 
ever before.
Debates today over food, climate change and oil often 
fall back on the idea of natural limits. But are these 
resources really ‘natural’? For example, in what way is it 
‘natural’ to burn oil? Oil did not become a resource until 
the invention of the internal combustion engine, and with 
the proliferation of electric cars and bio-fuels it will cease 
to be the most fought-over global resource. Oil is only 
important to human existence in the relatively recent era 
of industrialization, and, even then, only if you are one 
of the few who either buys it or owns it. Far from being 
a ‘natural’ resource, the demand for oil depends entirely 
on the existence of a socio-economic system that values 
and uses it.
David Harvey (1974) argues that the real cause of 
scarcity is the unequal distribution of resources. For 
example, the richest 1 per cent of the world’s adult pop-
ulation owned 40 per cent of global assets in the year 
2000. By contrast, the poorest half of the world adult 
population owned only 1 per cent of global wealth 
(Davies et al. 2006). As Harvey notes, the earth could 
not support the current population if everyone enjoyed 
a Western lifestyle. The idea that resource shortages 
are due to overstepping ‘natural’ limits conceals these 
grotesque imbalances. When we look at famines on a 
global scale, the problem is not food production, but the 
distribution of the food that we produce. Geographers 
have sought to understand who benefits and who suf-
fers from different social constructions of nature and 
blaming problems on overpopulation shifts the blame to 
the poorest people, while protecting the monopoly rich 
nations enjoy over resources. Radical geographers are 
interested in how constructions of nature serve different 
political interests. The notion of natural limits clearly 
serves the interests of those who control the lion’s share 
of the world’s wealth.
Social constructionists seek to understand how ideas 
of nature reproduce the cultural, political and spiritual 
beliefs of a society, and the ways in which ideas of nature 
are used to support specific political viewpoints. If cer-
tain types of behaviour or ways of organizing society can 
be shown to be ‘natural’, then it makes it hard to jus-
tify any other way of acting. The authority to speak for 
nature becomes the authority to speak for society. Geog-
raphy has traditionally tried to understand the interface 
between society and the environment, and the ways in 
which nature has been constructed and contested have 
particular relevance to this task.
each prompts very different reactions and will be inter-
preted variously by different types of people. For exam-
ple, a trained chemist will recognize the carbon molecule 
as constitutive of wood, while a conservationist will rec-
ognize that the forest depicted is not just any forest, but 
a rainforest – the most biodiverse habitat on the planet. 
Indigenous inhabitants of that rainforest will react with 
a whole different set of emotions, although they may not 
recognize their home from an aerial photo. The pile of 
timber is a resource to be burned, while the solitary tree 
is not. The way in which each representation is perceived 
depends on the experience and knowledge that the viewer 
has, which in turn depends on the society and culture in 
which he or she lives. Viewing nature as a social construct 
helps us to understand why people from different places 
and times behave so differently towards the environment. 
To return to the example of trees, early US settlers were 
fearful of the impenetrable dark forests that dominated 
the Eastern seaboard, and believed that clearing trees for 
agriculture was ‘God’s work’. In stark contrast to the atti-
tudes of today, chopping trees down was actually seen as 
morally good. The idea of nature is subjective – it means 
something slightly different to you than it does to me. 
This matters because it helps us to understand why con-
flicts occur over the environment and how they might be 
averted.
That said nature is often presented as if it is some-
thing fixed and objective, because it provides a powerful 
basis for how society should behave. As the American 
environmental historian William Cronon puts it, peo-
ple tend to ‘appeal to nature as a stable external source 
of non-human values against which human actions can 
be judged’ (1996: 26). Constructions of nature are thus 
highly political, because specific versions of what is ‘nat-
ural’ can be used to privilege certain social behaviours 
and actions over others.
Perhaps the most influential idea that has shaped 
debates concerning the environment and our relationship 
to it is that of the limits to growth. The idea that there are 
natural limits to population growth comes from the writ-
ings of Thomas Malthus in the late eighteenth century. 
Malthus was a churchman who deplored the overcrowd-
ing and unsavoury conditions in which the newly-created 
working classes of the British industrial revolution lived. 
In his Principle of Population he attributed this problem 
to a disjuncture between the geometric rate of popula-
tion increase (1,2,4,8,16) and the arithmetic rate of food 
supply (1,2,3,4,5). Overstepping the limits of natural 
resources (most notably at that time, food) would inevi-
tably result in famine and death. Malthus deplored the 
moral depravity of the working classes and sought to 
control their behaviour by invoking the idea of natural 
limits. Of course Malthus has been proved wrong. With

‘wilderness prophet’ John Muir founded the Sierra Club 
in California, which went on to establish a national wil-
derness preservation system. Of course, national parks 
are exactly that – parks – and great effort was required to 
preserve these areas as wildernesses. People had to be kept 
out, animals had to be kept in. Vistas had to be opened 
up for tourists while simultaneously not compromising 
the appearance of the area as untouched. So painstaking 
were the efforts to create wilderness that Muir actually 
praised Yosemite for its resemblance to an artificial land-
scape garden (Schama 1995: 191).
The artificiality of wilderness is taken to its extreme 
in the landscapes of Frederick Olmsted, who is perhaps 
most famous for designing New York’s Central Park. In 
1887 Olmsted became involved in the preservation of 
another symbolic American landmark of natural vigour, 
Niagara Falls. As William Irwin notes (1996: 77), Olm-
sted ‘believed that parks and nature retreats relieved the 
festering distress of the poor and working classes’. The 
area had become overrun with disorganized tourist devel-
opments and industry, and Olmsted sought to transform 
the area into a pure pastoral park in which the visitor 
might enjoy the splendour of nature in peace. In its return 
to nature, however, the minutest details were planned, 
including widespread landscaping and the installation 
of viewing points to maximize the vistas over the falls. 
The landscape that now surrounds the falls represents 
an idealized version of how Olmsted thought the Falls 
should look, rather than a reproduction of the original 
landscape, which was renowned for hindering the efforts 
of visitors to see the falls.
Wilderness appeals to the American psyche because it 
is reminiscent of the birth of their country through set-
tlement, and it remains a powerful and emotive cultural 
construction of nature in contemporary North America. 
However, while the idea of wilderness is aesthetic on one 
level today, the politics involved in valuing landscapes 
that are free of humans are still influential (see Case 
study 12.1).
In Britain the excesses of industrialization and 
urbanization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
generated a cultural backlash that began to value envi-
ronments that were seen as more natural. The Romantic 
movement which emerged at this time was typified by 
Wordsworth’s love of the Lake District and an increas-
ingly negative attitude towards cities. This was in part an 
aesthetic reaction to the physical degradation of the envi-
ronment associated with the Industrial Revolution, but 
it was also a moral reaction to the squalor and poverty 
of the cities. In contrast, the countryside became seen as 
the repository of moral purity. Interestingly, this repre-
sented a U-turn in British attitudes to wild landscapes. 
In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries mountainous 
12.2 Cultural constructions of nature
The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie – ­deliberate, 
contrived and dishonest – but the myth – persistent, persuasive 
and unrealistic.
(J.F. Kennedy)
David Demeritt (1998) identifies the main use of social 
constructionism within geography as refuting established 
claims about nature. This is perhaps not surprising as 
social constructions can be understood as a form of 
‘myth’ that may become widely accepted in the absence 
of any counter evidence. The majority of work in geog-
raphy on the construction of nature has sought to reveal 
myths concerning nature.
12.2.1 Wilderness
One of the most cherished notions of nature in West-
ern societies is that of wilderness. Images of wilderness 
are used widely, to sell holidays, relax us and inspire us. 
Motivational posters showing ‘man conquering the great 
outdoors’, with captions like ‘Success’ and ‘Risk’, will 
be familiar to you if you have ever set foot in a gym. The 
idea of wilderness as a form of nature untouched by 
humans has a long history. In the USA it has been argued 
that the idea of wilderness appealed to settlers, who, as 
they moved west across the country, preferred to believe 
that the lands they were claiming were devoid of humans 
and waiting to be inhabited. Exploding what he calls 
the ‘Pristine Myth’, Bill Denevan (1992) uses extensive 
archaeological and historical research to argue that native 
Amerindians actually managed their landscapes through 
cutting, burning, terracing and building. These forms of 
management created landscapes that European settlers 
assumed were untouched because they were unable to rec-
ognize forms of management that they were unfamiliar 
with. America was only a ‘discovery’ for the white Euro-
pean and, similarly, the plains of the USA only appeared 
to be uninhabited wildernesses to white European set-
tlers. While the idea of wilderness is obviously related 
to the inability of the settler to ‘see’ the human impacts 
upon unfamiliar landscapes, it had drastic effects. When 
indigenous people inconveniently did appear in these 
landscapes, they were often exterminated.
The idea of wilderness was fundamental to the birth 
of the modern environmental movement in North Amer-
ica. The first National Park was created by Congress in 
1864 in Yosemite Valley, quickly becoming a national 
symbol of the spiritual home of the modern United States 
in the aftermath of the Civil War. In 1892 the so-called

Contesting wilderness
Clayoquot Sound is a small ocean inlet on Vancou-
ver Island in British Columbia. The surrounding area 
contains ‘old growth’ temperate rainforest, one of the 
rarest habitats in the world. While such forests once 
covered large parts of Europe and Asia they now com-
prise just 0.01 per cent of the earth’s land area. In the 
early 1990s the logging firm MacMillan Bloedel applied 
for a logging licence in the area, but was vigorously 
opposed by the Western Canada Wilderness Society. 
The geographer Bruce Braun (2002) explored how the 
resulting dispute played out through a series of repre-
sentations and counter-representations of the area.
MacMillan Bloedel produced a brochure titled 
Beyond the Cut, which represented Clayoquot Sound 
as a natural resource that was needed by the Canadian 
people. Constructing the forest as a resource, they pre-
sented their credentials as responsible and experienced 
managers who would use scientific techniques to create 
a sustainable industry and create much-needed jobs.
By contrast, the Western Canada Wilderness 
Society produced a popular and glossily illustrated 
coffee-table book called On the Wild Side. In it they 
championed Clayoquot Sound as a pristine wilderness, 
evoking emotive spiritual ideas of the forest as a para-
dise unspoilt by humans.
On one level, the representations of the forest as eco-
nomic resource and ecological wilderness reproduced 
familiar opposing Western constructions of nature. But 
Braun’s real insight is that both the representations of 
the logging company and the environmental group fail to 
include the indigenous Indians who live in the forest. He 
argues that this erasure of the indigenous population is 
a common feature of both the wilderness and resource 
constructions of nature, and can be traced back to the 
tendency of settlers to appropriate nature from the indig-
enous peoples. The importance of constructing nature 
as separate from humans (in this case as uninhabited) 
allows powerful (if opposing) claims to be made over the 
area by both the logging company and the environmental 
group. The real political import of this process is that the 
people who live there are excluded from their own home.
Q   How does the idea of wilderness exert an influ-
ence over global conservation priorities?
landscape takes a three-dimensional world and repre-
sents a single view of it in two dimensions. In doing so 
it establishes a highly visual relation between the viewer 
and nature that emphasizes aesthetic detachment and 
mastery over nature.
A classic example of how a landscape painting con-
veys social power is found in John Berger’s (1990) analy-
sis of Gainsborough’s Mr and Mrs Andrews, which was 
completed c. 1750 (Plate 12.2). The painting depicts an 
upper-class land-owning couple in the foreground, with 
their estate stretching into the distance behind them. 
While the painting shows a highly cultivated patchwork 
of fields, there are no workers in this rural landscape. 
Their effacement represents the new balance of power 
in the countryside after the Enclosures Acts seized com-
mon land from peasants and parcelled it up to landown-
ers. The landscape is familiar to us as an archetypically 
English landscape, Constable Country if you like, and 
the nature in it is archetypically English. There are other 
things going on in this representation too, such as the 
dominance of the male figure standing over his seated 
wife, and the phallic symbol of the gun. The symbolism 
of masculine control over nature could not be more obvi-
ous. Landscape painting invented an English aesthetic of 
and uninhabited regions were actually regarded with 
fear and disregard. We have reports of travellers drawing 
the curtains of their carriages to block out the ‘Satanic’ 
view as they travelled through mountainous regions. Less 
than one hundred years before Wordsworth claimed of 
the Lake District ‘Who comes not hither ne’er shall know 
how beautiful the world below’, the great diarist Daniel 
Defoe called the area a ‘barren and frightful place’. So 
if you hate hiking up mountains, simply tell people you 
have an early Georgian attitude to nature!
As with the US environmental movement, the British 
Romantic movement established the idea that nature has 
spiritual value. In the United Kingdom this happened 
primarily as a reaction to industrialization, while in the 
United States it emerged from the pioneer/settler men-
tality. In each case the idea of nature has been carefully 
constructed by societies seeking to preserve a world free 
of human development.
12.2.2 Landscape
This new relation to nature was expressed through the 
genre of landscape painting, which emerged in the sev-
enteenth and eighteenth centuries. As a way of seeing,

agenda should dispel forever the illusion of innocence sur-
rounding the words nature, natural, and native . . .’.
The British association of nature with idealized rural 
landscapes has impacts that are felt beyond the art gallery. 
One is to divide the affairs of the city from the affairs of 
the country. The graffiti artist Banksy produced a series 
of works exploring the politics of this division, in which 
he placed typically ‘urban’ objects such as parking tick-
ets and graffiti into traditional landscape paintings (see 
Plate 12.3). This juxtaposition disturbs constructions of 
the countryside as a somehow ‘natural’ place untroubled 
by the problems of cities, and in doing so highlights how 
exclusive this vision of the countryside actually is. As 
rural geographers have noted, the idea of the rural idyll 
is not particularly helpful as it conceals real problems 
of poverty, drug-use and deprivation in rural areas (see 
landscape, but it also established a new era of control, 
both of humans over nature and of the landed upper 
classes over the countryside in Britain.
Representations of landscape are central to national 
identities. Indeed, the word ‘nature’ derives from the 
Latin natura, which comes in turn from nasci – to be 
born. Thus nature is linked to other words from the 
same root, such as nascent, innate, native and nation. 
Just as wilderness plays an important symbolic role in the 
pioneer mentality of the USA, so the ‘countryside’ land-
scape is quintessentially English. Authors have explored 
the importance of the oak tree to British culture, as a sign 
of strength derived from their use to build the ships that 
allowed the British navy to rule the seas for 200 years.
These constructions of nature also have profound 
political effects. The historical geographer David Lowen-
thal (1994) argues that in France the legacy of peasant 
agriculture has left a national landscape of diverse small-
holdings, which is cherished for the variety of cheese, 
wines and foods that it produces. Staunch French oppo-
sition to proposed reforms to the European Common 
Agricultural Policy, which would increase the exposure 
of its small producers to market forces, suddenly becomes 
intelligible as an attempt to preserve the French landscape 
and culture rather than simply blunt economic protec-
tionism (see Chapter 11). The relationship between land-
scape and national identity was carried to its ideological 
extreme by the Nazis, who were probably the most eco-
logically aware government ever to exist.
Fond of being photographed in forest settings, they 
viewed the Black Forest of southern Germany as their spir-
itual home. Non-native plants were eradicated in exactly the 
same way as the non-Aryan human population. As Anne 
Whiston Spirn notes (1997: 253–4) ‘the use of “native” 
plants and “natural” gardens to represent the Nazi political

lens that has been moulded by their social experience’. 
However sanitized lab work is made to appear, experi-
ments require human interaction and judgements to 
work. Science is a particularly influential realm in which 
nature is constructed and contested, because it has the 
capacity to make very strong truth claims about reality, 
and hence how we should live and behave. But its findings 
and models remain influenced by cultural factors.
12.3.2 Ecology and politics
In the past 30 years, geographers have become increas-
ingly interested in how dominant models of ecology rely 
on social constructions of nature. The field of politi-
cal ecology recognizes that ecological knowledge is not 
always neutral, but reflects the specific aims of those 
involved in producing it. This can have profound politi-
cal consequences upon how different landscapes are man-
aged, and for whom. In the words of Paul Robbins (2004: 
12), the goal of political ecology is to ‘take the hatchet’ to 
environmental myths, using both scientific and social sci-
entific studies to expose the false assumptions and unsuit-
ability of certain ecological models. Bill Deneven’s work 
on the ‘Pristine Myth’ described in the previous section 
is an example of this, but the hatchet has been taken to 
other scientific myths too (see Case study 12.2).
Chapter 11). Conversely, urban areas are assumed to be 
bereft of nature, despite often being more biodiverse than 
massive swathes of agricultural land, and supporting vast 
infrastructures to control elements such as water and 
waste (Gandy 2002). In many ways elements of nature are 
more important in the city, but have simply been ignored 
until recently, as they do not correspond with unspoken 
cultural constructions of what nature should look like.
12.3 Environmental myths
12.3.1 The power of science
What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our 
method of questioning.
(Heisenberg 1958)
Science adheres to a very detailed and rigorous set of rules 
for building knowledge that accurately reflects the natural 
world, but in practice science is not immune to social con-
structions of nature. As the biologist Richard Lewontin 
says (1993: 3), ‘Scientists do not begin life as scientists, 
after all, but as social beings immersed in a family, a state, 
a productive structure, and they view nature through a 
Case study 12.2 
Desertification
Desertification became an important international 
issue in the 1970s when successive years of drought 
in the Sahel (the area bordering the southern edge of 
the Sahara) caused widespread famine. The United 
Nations (UN) responded with the 1977 conference on 
desertification, and a subsequent Convention to Com-
bat Desertification, which focused on land degradation 
in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas. This con-
ference popularized and publicized the term, but was 
based on little actual science. David Thomas and Nick 
Middleton (1994) have identified four ‘myths’ of deser-
tification in dryland areas:
1	 That it is a ‘voracious process’ affecting one-third of 
the world’s land area.
2	 That drylands are fragile ecosystems.
3	 That desertification is the primary cause of human 
suffering and misery.
4	 That the UN is central to its understanding and 
solution.
They argue that the idea of desertification forms 
part of a longer history of reports from Westerners 
in the Sahara concerning advancing deserts. For 
example, early accounts of desertification originated 
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when 
scholars believed the Sahara to have been created 
by the Romans and Phoenicians through deforesta-
tion, overgrazing and over-cultivation. In the twentieth 
century, colonial land managers took on this idea that 
deserts advance because of the mismanagement and 
over-exploitation of land. In 1935 E.P. Stebbing, a for-
ester, published his views widely on the causes of the 
‘encroaching Sahara’ in British West Africa, blaming 
shortened agricultural fallow periods, shifting agricul-
ture and overgrazing. It was concluded that the Sahara 
had grown, and was still growing, owing to poor land 
management, which had worsened under the colonial 
regime. The spectre of sand dunes encroaching upon 
fertile land remained an enthralling one, and a report in 
1975 suggested that the Sahara was advancing at the 
astonishing rate of 5.5 km per year.

254    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
such as Amazonian Indians, who are romantically depicted 
living at one with nature, almost as part of nature rather 
than humanity (Slater 1995). The exclusion of humans 
from ecological models distorts conservation practices, 
which lack the ability to capture the value of landscapes 
influenced by humans. These oversights are unfortunate; 
not only do humans influence almost all habitats today, 
but, in order to live more sustainably, we require ecological 
models that can understand humans as part of ecosystems 
rather than just undesirable disturbances to them.
12.4 Constructing human nature
There is a long tradition of looking directly to the animal 
world in order to establish how humans should behave, 
and science has been integral to such attempts. If science 
can show certain behaviours or modes of social organi-
zation to be ‘natural’, then it is assumed that they are 
unquestionably ‘right’. As evolutionary biologist and 
social commentator Richard Lewontin (1993: 87) sug-
gests, ‘the problem for political philosophers has always 
been to try to justify their particular view of human 
nature’. This is a game of high stakes; think about how 
often you hear political commentators talk about things 
like war being ‘a part of human nature’, or capitalists 
➜
Thomas and Middleton question both the sup-
posed pace and causes of this process. They suggest 
that biophysical processes have been the primary 
cause of Saharan advance over the twentieth cen-
tury, because of the progressive desiccation (drying 
out) of North Africa since the end of the Pleistocene 
ice-age 10,000 years ago. Advances and retreats 
within this overall pattern reflect climatic variations 
in rainfall over tens of years. They also attack the 
idea that humans are to blame for desertification, 
arguing that policies to reduce the grazing of dryland 
areas are ineffective. ‘Expert’ knowledges about 
dryland fragility, they argue, actually undermine adap-
tive strategies that have evolved over centuries. For 
example, lowering livestock densities damages the 
ability of local farmers to resist drought. The focus 
on mismanagement obscures both the biophysical 
causes of dryland degradation and specific social 
problems, such as firewood scarcity. As Batterbury 
and Warren note (2001), degradation is usually local-
ized and ephemeral, and it is very hard to overgraze 
in a dynamic non-equilibrium system dominated by 
annual grasses, such as rangelands, where external 
forces like drought far outweigh human factors like 
over-stocking.
The myth of desertification is bound up with the fail-
ure of Western scientists to understand the dynamics of 
dryland areas, simply falling back on received colonial 
stereotypes of overgrazing and advancing deserts. As 
Paul Robbins states (2004: 109), the notion of soil ero-
sion was ‘a social construction that helped to secure 
colonial power’, and while the term is generally consid-
ered unhelpful amongst scientists today, it perseveres 
within the policies of international agencies such as the 
UN and NGOs.
Once specific constructions of nature become 
established, they assume a life of their own. Funding 
streams for research, policies and the vested inter-
ests of those that work within the field act to keep 
the concern alive. As they circulate through networks 
of scientists, institutions, funding bodies, the media 
and policies, such constructions of nature become 
­established as seemingly incontrovertible facts.
Q   Why is it hard to produce definite scientific 
answers to large-scale environmental questions?
These myths have real influence over the way in which 
environmental problems are tackled. For example, the 
assumption that degradation is caused by mismanage-
ment generally leads to the imposition of solutions upon 
people, rather than developing solutions that use their 
local knowledge and understanding (see Robbins 2004, 
Chapter 8, for a wealth of examples). This resonates 
with Bruce Braun’s work on Clayoquot Sound discussed 
in the previous section, where both economic and envi-
ronmental representations of the forest actively excluded 
the indigenous population living there.
There are aspects of ecological science that clearly 
reflect the places and periods in which they developed. 
Directly parroting the language of US settlement, ecolo-
gists in the early twentieth century talked about the suc-
cession of plant ‘communities’ from pioneers, who come 
in first and settle an area, through to the stable ‘climax’ 
forest. There is some circularity to this process. Models 
of ecology reflect the social context in which they are pro-
duced, but then, having become established as scientific 
‘facts’, become models for human society. Some authors 
have argued that the appeal of nature as a stable commu-
nity goes back to the Judaeo-Christian myth of the Garden 
of Eden, when humans supposedly lived in perfect har-
mony with nature before their fall from grace. This yearn-
ing for a return to innocence often finds expression in the 
kinds of stories that are told about indigenous peoples,

the researchers conducting the study. Male research teams 
demonstrate a tendency to explain ape behaviour in terms 
of sexual competition between aggressive males to impreg-
nate passive females. By contrast, female primatologists 
focus on communication and basic survival activities of 
the apes, generating very different interpretations of their 
social behaviour. Depending on who is doing the research, 
different aspects of behaviour will be measured and dif-
ferent inferences drawn from them. Gender and politics 
become tangled up in the process of scientific enquiry, so 
that the ape becomes the site of legitimization for what is 
and is not ‘natural’. This in turn provides a proxy moral 
framework for the social behaviour of humans. A more 
recent debate to hit the media involves the naturalness of 
homosexuality (see Case study 12.3).
justifying the free market on the grounds that competi-
tion and the need to own things are ‘in our nature’. It 
does not take much to spot the flaws in this logic. Animals 
do not cook, but no one would say cooking food is wrong 
because it is unnatural (apart from Raw Food advocates, 
of course). Putting it another way, James Weinrich says, 
‘when animals do something that we like, we say it is 
natural. When they do something that we don’t like, we 
call it animalistic’ (1982: in Bagemihl 1999: 77).
The attempt to draw parallels between animal and 
human behaviour is one of the most obvious ways in which 
nature acts as a mirror for the values of society. Donna 
Haraway’s (1989) work on primatology (the study of apes) 
re-examines evidence from major research projects on ape 
behaviour to show that they are biased by the gender of

Gay animals
WHAT DOES A DOG HAVE TO DO ROUND HERE TO 
PROVE HE’S GAY????!!!!!
(Ingilby 2002)
In 1999 a biologist called Bruce Bagemihl published a 
book called Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexu-
ality and Natural Diversity (Bagemihl 1999). Drawing 
upon a lifetime of research, Bagemihl works his way 
through the animal world, from mammals to birds to 
cockroaches, describing a profusion of homosexuality, 
bisexuality, orgies, transvestism and transgenderism. 
The book includes field sketches of female bonobos 
engaging in cunnilingus and photographs of male 
whales entwining their penises in sexual commun-
ion, all of which provoked a considerable degree of 
outrage. Being gay is seen as an exclusively human 
behaviour, something that by definition is not natural. 
This is a longstanding Christian idea (although there 
is very little about it in the bible). The Church Council 
of Nablus in AD 1120 wrote the first law condemning 
homosexuality, which was subsequently preserved in 
the Vatican library. By the time of the Renaissance this 
idea had found its way into the laws of many countries, 
and today many groups in society claim that homo-
sexuality is wrong because it is ‘unnatural’.
Bruce Bagemihl’s book threw this myth into doubt. 
In some penguin colonies, as many as one in ten 
pairs of penguins may be same-sex, while in bonobo 
chimpanzees the whole species is bisexual. If homo-
sexuality is found throughout the animal kingdom then 
how can it possibly be unnatural? As Bagemihl (1999: 
78) says, ‘what is remarkable about the entire debate 
about the naturalness of homosexuality is the frequent 
absence of any reference to concrete facts or accurate, 
comprehensive information about animal homosexual-
ity’. Bagemihl also asks a more fundamental question: 
how has science overlooked this considerable subset 
of animal behaviour? His answer is that zoology is 
essentially a conservative profession, dominated by 
white male heterosexuals who impose social assump-
tions about homosexuality as perverse and unnatural 
on to the things they study. He gives examples of how 
the term ‘homosexual’ is avoided in favour of terms like 
‘male-only social interactions’, ‘multi-female associa-
tions’, unisexuality, isosexuality or intrasexuality. As one 
newspaper reported at the time,
A female ape wraps her legs around another female, 
rubbing her own clitoris against her partner’s while 
emitting screams of enjoyment. The researcher 
explains: It’s a form of greeting behavior. Or reconcilia-
tion. Possibly food-exchange behavior. It’s certainly not 
sex. Not lesbian sex. Not hot lesbian sex . . .
(McCarthy 1999)
It is not only science that is to blame either. How com-
mon is it for parents to tell small children who enquire 
why two male dogs are mounting each other that they 
are just ‘confused’? In the USA pet owners have been 
acquitted for shooting their dogs on the grounds that they 
were exhibiting ‘gay’ behaviour. The topic of gay animals 
is laced with contradiction, which may explain why it is 
a topic so beloved of comedians, from Ricky Gervais to 
South Park’s ‘Big Gay Al’s Big Gay Animal Sanctuary’ 
➜

256    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
Estimates varied wildly from 40,000 and 200,000. When 
the preliminary results were published in 2001 it turned 
out that humans only have about 32,000 genes, far fewer 
than expected. The most disturbing element of this dis-
covery was how close other organisms were, with the 
popular press jumping on the fact that the weed thale 
cress has 25,000 gene pairs, worms 19,000 and banana 
flies 13,600. Suddenly we were not as special as we had 
thought.
Within the scientific world the idea of human unique-
ness, although momentarily shaken, was rescued by the 
explanation that our genes interact in complex ways that 
allow them to produce greater numbers of proteins than 
in other organisms. It appeared that individual genes did 
not control individual elements of an organism’s phe-
notype (appearance and behaviour) after all. The idea 
of natural human superiority was transposed from gene 
numbers to protein numbers, and the things being com-
pared shifted from genes to base pairs. So while report-
ers could write that we share 99 per cent of our genes 
with apes, they could simultaneously state that we do not 
share 3.5 million base pairs, thus upholding the distinc-
tion between human and animal. While science places us 
firmly in nature, our cultural beliefs require reaffirmation 
of our uniqueness.
12.4.2 Natural disasters
Today, these versions of nature come together in media 
descriptions of natural disasters, which hold both a fas-
cination with the frailty of human life, and highlight the 
12.4.1 Our place in nature
The biological sciences have also attempted to interrogate 
our genes to find out what makes humans distinctive from 
other organisms. Attempting to place humans in nature, 
while simultaneously maintaining their position above 
nature, is an old trick. The ‘great chain of being’ devised 
by medieval cosmologists represents a clear ordering of 
different things and beings in the world, with humans 
second only to God. Maintaining a scientific basis for 
human superiority has become progressively harder since 
Darwin placed us squarely among the apes, but has gen-
erally been based upon the argument that, while made 
of the same stuff, humans are much more complex than 
other animals.
While our attempts to benchmark human behaviour 
against ‘natural’ standards have tended to fail, even our 
own biology is not quite what we were hoping. The 
Human Genome Project (HGP) was a major interna-
tional scientific collaboration to map the entire human 
genome (the entire set of human genes that determines 
the sequence of our DNA), begun in 1990 and completed 
in 2003. The project aimed to advance our understand-
ing of human genes in order to support biotechnology 
research. Tori Holmberg (2005) has argued that the HGP 
represented a modern attempt to discover some inherent 
physical basis for what makes ‘human-ness’ distinct from 
nature. By counting the number of genes of other organ-
isms as well, the HGP promised a potential verification 
of human superiority.
As the HGP progressed the issue of how many genes 
human beings possessed became increasingly vexed. 
➜
and Sparky the Gay Dog (famously played by George 
Clooney).
Prudishness is only half the story though. Bagemihl’s 
work is scientifically controversial because it suggests 
that sex is not solely practised for reproduction.  
This seems to contradict the most important theory in 
biology – ­that of evolution. Researching animal homo-
sexuality is not the road to a successful career: applica-
tions for research grants that appear ignorant of the 
theory of evolution do not tend to stand a good chance 
of receiving funding. However, sex between animals – as 
between humans – is often a matter of enjoyment, rather 
than procreation, and this applies to animals of the 
same sex as well as opposite sexes. Non-heterosexual 
practices can also be beneficial. For example, pairs of 
male birds may rear eggs ‘donated’ by a female, and two 
males can command a larger territory than a heterosex-
ual pair, improving the chances of survival for chicks.
In 2006 the Oslo Natural History Museum ran an 
exhibition on gay animals, tellingly called ‘Against 
nature’ (BBC 2006). There was considerable hostility 
to the exhibition, with organisers reporting criticism and 
of being told by one opponent they would ‘burn in hell’. 
An American commentator said it was an example of 
‘propaganda invading science’. More recently still, sci-
entists in America have claimed that they can ‘cure’ gay 
sheep by manipulating hormone levels in their brains to 
make them attracted to ewes (Oakeshott and Gourlay 
2006). The implication that gayness might be ‘curable’ 
in humans has caused outrage. Competing construc-
tions of nature are not only highly charged politically, 
but cut across science and religion, parts of modern 
society that are often seen as unrelated.
Q   Do you think there is any such thing as human 
nature?

too. The Cambridge dictionary defines a disaster as 
‘an event causing great damage, injury or loss of life’, 
which means that it cannot be a disaster unless there 
are people involved. Yet equally a natural disaster would 
be a massive event not harming humans in any way. But 
the things commonly described as natural disasters do 
harm humans. Increasingly disasters are seen as events 
that exacerbate pre-existing social and economic prob-
lems. The flooding of New Orleans in 2005 in the wake 
of Hurricane Katrina demonstrates this point well – the 
people who were harmed most were the poorest because 
they were unable to leave. Media representations of 
the disaster tended to fall back on the traditional con-
struction of nature as a destructive force. A New York 
Times editorial on 30 August 2005 led with the headline 
‘Nature’s Revenge’, even though it went on to criticize 
the government policies that exacerbated the disaster 
(notably the loss of protective coastal wetlands to devel-
opment and the disrepair of the levees due to federal 
budget cuts).
The idea that nature can do things to us often results 
in its personification as a subjective force (in this case 
harbouring a whim for revenge). While The Day After 
Tomorrow reflects our fears about upsetting nature 
through the inadvertent effects of burning fossil fuels, 
potential for future ecological destruction. In the envi-
ronmental era, the spectre of global catastrophe is con-
stantly invoked, from the impending ice age predicted in 
the 1970s, to the threat of global warming that emerged 
in the 1990s. In The Ecology of Fear, Mike Davis (1998) 
explores this fascination with disaster through the city 
of Los Angeles, which he claims has been destroyed 145 
times on film and in books by everything ranging from 
earthquakes and nuclear weapons to Bermuda grass and 
the Devil. Crisis fascinates humans; it sells papers and 
makes people watch TV and films.
The film The Day After Tomorrow suggests what may 
happen if the Gulf Stream shuts down because of the 
melting of the Canadian and Greenland ice caps due to 
climate change. While there is evidence from Quaternary 
studies that this has possibly happened in the past, the 
film suggests that it could freeze the North Atlantic over-
night. In reality the process would take at least 50 (and 
probably more like 500) years. As the poster for the film 
shows (Plate 12.4), nature’s capacity for destruction is 
used to sensationalize the film. Representations of crisis 
can also be politically useful, for example to international 
aid agencies seeking to attract funding.
The irony here of course it that there is little ‘nat-
ural’ about a natural disaster – humans are required

environmentalism, a fragile blue image that transcends 
national borders and political divisions, and on which 
human features are invisible.
The second construction of nature beloved of the 
media is that of an uncontrollable, violent force. This 
version of nature is older, speaking to a pre-modern 
period in which human fortunes were largely determined 
by climate, natural disasters and disease. Press reports of 
floods and hurricanes often speak of nature’s wrath, and 
the unstoppable forces of nature. While the constructions 
of fragility and violence appear to be contradictory, they 
both reveal insecurities in society’s relation to the envi-
ronment. Our original fear of nature’s capricious power 
to destroy drove us to strive to control and dominate our 
surroundings, but our technological mastery has now 
made us the potential authors of our own destruction. 
The quote from the trailer for Al Gore’s documentary, 
which opens this section, asks whether we betrayed the 
planet, or the planet betrayed us. While one can ask 
whether it is possible for a lump of rock to betray any-
thing, let alone ‘us’, the personification of nature he uses 
evokes both our power over nature (the capacity for us to 
betray the planet) and fear of nature (the possibility that 
it is going to betray us).
Parallels with religious stories of God punishing 
humans are hard to ignore. But before we laugh too much 
at the polytheistic beliefs of ancient civilizations that saw 
nature as a world inhabited by gods, we should remem-
ber that the US National Hurricane Center continues an 
old tradition of giving names to hurricanes. Such disas-
ters are also commonly referred to as ‘acts of God’ by 
politicians and insurance companies. The BBC website 
offers some clues as to what nature may have been tak-
ing revenge for, claiming that the levees surrounding New 
Orleans were a ‘snub to nature’. Statements like this beg 
the question of whether it is actually possible to offend 
water and wind, and if so, how water and wind would 
be able to seek revenge. Representations of these disasters 
as somehow being the ‘fault’ of nature distract attention 
from the political, economic and social causes of human 
loss.
12.5.1 Environmental knowledge and the media
Climate change and natural disasters are pervasive, invad-
ing our TV screens and monopolizing newspaper column 
inches. And everyone seems concerned, from movie stars 
like Angelina Jolie to politicians like David Cameron. 
Never has nature been so hot a topic.
The media is a critical sphere in which knowledges 
about nature are produced and consumed. The wild-
life documentaries that are broadcast into our homes 
a similar understanding holds concerning the potential 
impact of intended responses as well. The potential to 
‘geo-engineer’ our climate by injecting particles into 
the atmosphere that would reduce the amount of the 
sun’s energy reaching the surface sounds like science 
fiction, but is being seriously explored as a potential 
palliative to global warming. Given that this is a fairly 
unusual and unknown option the UK government com-
missioned research to investigate public opinion on it, 
which revealed a strongly held general concern about the 
dangers of ‘meddling with mother nature’ (Corner et al. 
2013). The idea of nature as something that exists sepa-
rately to us in a state of equilibrium, but which is liable 
to exert its wrath upon us if we ‘meddle’ too much in its 
affairs is clearly alive and well.
12.5 Nature and the media
Did the planet betray us? Or did we betray the planet?
(Trailer for the film An Inconvenient Truth)
In each of the examples discussed so far, the idea of what 
is and is not natural forms a critical bone of contention. 
The way in which different positions are represented is 
important in understanding how certain ideas become 
dominant. For example, the idea of wilderness is insepa-
rable from its representation in landscape painting and, 
more recently, photography. But how does this process 
work out in the mainstream media?
It is possible to identify two dominant constructions 
of nature that animate media discussions of environ-
mental change: fragility and violence. The first is closely 
related to the emergence of environmentalism, which is 
concerned with the health of the planet that human-
kind depends upon for its survival. While the idea of 
caring for the planet seems quite normal to us now, 
this idea only emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. Denis 
Cosgrove (1994) argues that the environmental mindset 
was shaped by the release of photographs of the earth 
taken during the Apollo Space missions in 1968 and 1972 
(see Introduction, Plate 1). Splashed across newspapers 
and television, pictures of the earth from space had a 
huge cultural impact. Never before had the planet upon 
which we live been viewed as a single object, and the 
image of an orb hanging in space seemed to show the 
planet at its most vulnerable, as a finite, isolated island 
in a sea of nothingness. Books were written likening 
the earth to a ‘spaceship’, replete with life-support 
systems that require managing and conserving. The 
image of the earth became the leitmotif for Western 

Chapter 12  Social constructions of nature    259
reproduce notions of Africa as a great wilderness, going 
to great lengths to capture scenes in which people and 
evidence of people are absent (Davies 2000). This is an 
increasingly difficult task given the level of tourist traf-
fic and numbers of indigenous peoples that are found 
across many African savannah areas. Wildlife films 
have been edited for years to present only heterosexual 
animals, and TV shows like ‘Meercat Manor’ go out 
of their way to liken animal behavior to that found in 
typical human families. The Internet represents a huge 
source of scientific knowledge but is largely unregu-
lated, producing a range of conflicting claims about 
the state of nature. For example, popular environmen-
tal websites vary wildly in their estimates of biodiver-
sity loss (Ashlin and Ladle 2006 provide a salutary tale 
concerning the unreliability of information from the 
Internet).
The media has assumed increased importance in shap-
ing how people understand environmental issues. This 
is nowhere felt more strongly than in relation to climate 
change, which has generated a huge amount of media 
coverage (Boykoff 2007) concerning whether or not we 
are to blame and if so what should be done about it. 
While scientists have become increasingly certain that 
changes to the earth’s atmosphere are being caused by 
humans (IPCC 2013), action has been slow to follow. An 
Institute for Public Policy Research report has claimed 
that the representations of climate change in the media 
are unhelpfully alarmist, focusing on thrilling headlines 
that prevent the public from understanding what they can 
do about the problem (Ereaut and Segnit 2006). Based 
on research that analyzed more than 600 newspaper arti-
cles, and 90 TV and radio excerpts, the report identified 
the dominant construction of nature driving the climate 
change debate as ‘alarmist’. Such articles focus on the 
overwhelming size of the problem, and its potentially 
disastrous effects. By focusing on the terrible, unstop-
pable forces of nature, alarmist constructions represent a 
form of ‘climate pornography’ that seeks to thrill rather 
than increase understanding or engender action. This 
construction distracts us from what we can actually do 
to tackle environmental change. It is particularly destruc-
tive to the campaign of ‘small actions’, which empha-
sizes how small changes to behaviour can help combat 
climate change (and save money in the process). The 
report suggests that the small actions campaign is ren-
dered impotent by the sheer scale of the alarmist claims. 
As the primary interface between the majority of the 
population and environmental issues, the way in which 
ideas of nature are communicated has a decisive impact 
on how people understand and respond to environmental 
challenges.
12.6 Conclusions
12.6.1 Nature: a dangerous idea?
This chapter started by asking what nature is. Geographers 
have sought to answer this question in a range of ways, 
suggesting that nature is a social construction that varies 
between places and periods. Rather than lessen its impor-
tance, the idea that nature is an idea reveals its power to 
dictate how we should behave, how we should live and how 
we should value and use the environment. It justifies the 
exploitation of certain people while validating the luxuries 
of others. It has been used to persecute homosexuals and 
legitimize genocide. Nature is indeed a dangerous idea.
At the beginning of the chapter it was argued that 
social constructionists seek to demonstrate two aspects 
of nature: first how ideas of nature do not represent some 
external ‘truth’ but, rather, come to reflect the cultural, 
political and spiritual beliefs of a society; and second, the 
ways in which ideas of nature are used to advance spe-
cific political viewpoints. In light of the case studies, this 
picture has become more complex. As dominant cultural 
norms and preferences influence ideas about nature, so 
these arguments about nature are then used to support 
dominant cultural norms. Geographers seek to reveal the 
circularity of this process in order to expose repressive 
ideologies and open up new political possibilities for soci-
ety and our relationship to the environment.
12.6.2 The challenge
The idea of nature remains central to the challenges fac-
ing society in the twenty-first century. The growing prior-
ity attached to climate change by leading political figures 
means that debates concerning how we should live, who 
should make sacrifices and how change should be managed 
are becoming ever more pressing. The increasing influence 
of biotechnology as a major global industry raises ques-
tions concerning how far we should manipulate biology 
to our benefit, and whether or not knowledge about our 
genes will reveal some essential truths of human existence. 
The idea of nature looms large in all these debates, and 
will continue to do so. You will see people talking about 
nature every day on the TV, in newspapers and around 
you in everyday life. Think about what people mean when 
they use the word. What characteristics are they attribut-
ing to nature? What are they excluding? What political and 
social arguments are they supporting through their appeal 
to nature? Be critical of how nature is used; the power to 
refute dominant presentations of the world and our place 
in it is the power to create a different world.

13.1 What is culture?
This chapter explores some of the challenges posed by 
and for culture in the twenty-first century. First, however, 
it is necessary to define what is meant by culture. This 
is a complex and difficult task. By the 1950s, for exam-
ple, there were over 150 different academic definitions of 
culture. As Mike Crang (1998: 1) argues, despite sound-
ing like the most airy of concepts, culture ‘can only be 
approached as embedded in real-life situations, in tem-
porally and spatially specific ways’. Cultures are part 
of everyday life. They are systems of shared meanings 
that people who belong to the same community, group 
or nation use to help them interpret and make sense of 
the world, and to reproduce themselves. These systems of 
meanings are often based around such things as religion, 
language, ethnicity, custom and tradition, and ideas about 
‘place’, which can exist on a number of different spatial 
scales (local, regional, national, global, among communi-
ties, groups or nations). Cultures are one of the princi-
pal means by which identities are constructed. They give 
us a sense of ‘who we are’, ‘where we belong’ – a sense 
of our own identity and identity with others. Cultures 
are embodied in the material and social world and are 
dynamic rather than static, shifting and changing histori-
cally through processes of cultural mixing, diffusion and 
transculturation (discussed below).
Cultures are also socially determined and defined and, 
therefore, not divorced from power relations. Dominant 
groups in society attempt to impose their ideas about 
culture and these are challenged by other groups, or 
subcultures. The latter might include various types of 
youth culture, gang culture, and different ethnicities or 
sexualities, where identities are organized around dif-
ferent sets of practices and operate in different spaces 
from dominant cultures (Crang 1998). Culture makes the 
world meaningful and significant. Geographers suggest 
that we should think of culture ‘not as a thing, but as 
a relationship’ (Mitchell 2000: xviii) or as a process in 
which we are all involved. Cultures include those social 
practices that produce meaning, as well as those practices 
that are shaped by those shared meanings.
13.1.1 The ‘cultural turn’
Culture has generated a great deal of interest in recent 
years, for academics, policy makers, and at the popular 
level. Geographers have turned their attention towards 
cultural explanations of global, national and local phe-
nomena, exploring issues such as the cultural embed-
dedness of economic processes (e.g. James 2007), the 
relationship between cultures, identities and consumption 
(see Chapter 19), and cultural constructions of social 
relations of gender, ethnicity and class that shape peo-
ple’s lives (e.g. Nelson and Seager 2004). However, the 
current popularity of culture is not simply a trend in 
academe, but is reflective of a broader cultural turn in 
(Western) society as a whole.
The world has changed fundamentally in the past 
three decades and these changes are deeply cultural 
in character. For example, enormous changes have 
occurred in ‘advanced’ economies since the early 1980s 
(the decline in manufacturing, the growth of services, 
the feminization of the workforce, increased flexibil-
ity – all characteristic of ‘post-Fordism’, as discussed 
in ­Chapter 3). However, as cultural theorist Stuart Hall 
(1996: 233) argued, if ‘post-Fordism’ exists, it is as much 
a description of cultural as of economic change. Florida 
(2002) characterizes this as a shift from an industrial to a 
creative age, with 40 per cent of people in the US and UK 
economies now working in ‘creative’ sectors of science, 
technology, culture, arts and entertainment, and creative 
economies burgeoning in cities as diverse as New York, 
Shanghai and Bangalore. Culture has increasingly been 
brought into governmental and economic spheres, with 
creative economy initiatives developed for a number of 
years for small towns and small- and medium-sized cit-
ies as well as rural regions in the UK, Australia, New 
Zealand and Canada (Christopherson and Clark 2007; 
Christopherson 2008). These initiatives hinge on the 
arts and community cultural activities, including festi-
vals and special events, which are believed to contribute 
to community identity, increase community pride and 
foster participation in local economies. Creative indus-
tries, it is argued, boost the local economy by attracting 
tourists, employers and a workforce who appreciate the 
sense of community that they generate.
Cultural and creative industries have also recently 
become a policy priority in international development. 
Global trade of creative goods and services reached a 
record of US$624 billion in 2011, more than doubling 
from 2002 to 2011 (UNCTAD), with a 12.1 per cent 
annual growth in export of cultural products from coun-
tries in the global South. Cultural industries (audiovisual 
products, design, new media, performing arts, publishing 
and visual arts) are thus one of the most rapidly growing 
sectors of the world economy and a highly transforma-
tive one in terms of income generation, job creation, and 
export earnings. A recent report (UNESCO 2013) argues 
that unlocking the potential of the creative economy is a 
means for promoting the overall creativity of societies, 
affirming the distinctive identity of the places where it 
flourishes and clusters, improving quality of life, and 
enhancing local image and prestige. Culture is increas-
ingly viewed as core to local creative economies in the

the rise of ‘cultural tourism’ (Gibson 2009). In southern 
Africa, for example, many ‘cultural villages’ have sprung 
up in rural areas to showcase local traditions and sell 
crafts. These villages are intended to change the relation-
ship between consumers in the global North and peoples 
in global South, being less exploitative of the latter in 
economic terms and supposedly fostering greater cultural 
exchange. However, as Saarinen (2007) points out, these 
cultural villages have developed largely in response to 
what tourists want; communities package and sell a ver-
sion of their culture that fits with Western ideas of what 
African culture should be.
13.1.2 The ‘spatial turn’
There has also been a ‘spatial turn’ in explanations in 
cultural and social theory. The world is changing fast, and 
the rate of change is probably greater than ever before. 
Fast-developing technologies such as the Internet and 
satellite communications mean that the world is becom-
ing more global and more interconnected. The increased 
speed of transport and communications, the increasing 
intersections between economies and cultures, the growth 
of international migration and the power of global finan-
cial markets are among the factors that have changed 
everyday lives in recent decades. There is no historical 
equivalent of the global reach and volume of ‘cultural 
traffic’ (Held et al. 1999) through contemporary telecom-
munications, broadcasting and transport technologies. 
The challenge for geographers is to find ways of under-
standing and interpreting these changes.
Culture can be said to operate at three spatial scales: 
local, national and global. Two main interpretations have 
dominated discussion. The first highlights the global 
aspects of change. At its simplest, this approach sug-
gests that it is possible to identify processes of cultural 
­homogenization – the idea that everywhere is becom-
ing the same – dominated by the USA and most eas-
ily recognized in terms such as ‘Coca-Colonization’, 
‘McDonaldization’ and ‘Hollywoodization’ (Jackson 
2004) (see Chapter 19). This cultural globalization 
involves the movement of people, objects and images 
around the world through telecommunications, language, 
the media industries, radio and music, cinema, television 
and tourism. The second interpretation places emphasis 
on the local and the localization of people’s everyday lives 
and experiences. Instead of homogenization, emphasis is 
placed on the diversity of culture, on the ways in which 
global brands such as Coca-Cola or McDonald’s are rein-
terpreted locally so that they take on different meanings 
in different places. The emphasis here is on the intercon-
nectedness of global and local processes. For example, 
although the same event can be witnessed simultaneously 
global South and vital to forging new development path-
ways. This is illustrated by cities such as Cape Town, 
designated World Design Capital 2014; Johannesburg, 
actively promoted as a world-class African city of culture 
through arts festivals and city-wide cultural events; Rabat, 
labelled Moroccan Capital of Culture; Gwangju (South 
Korea), Yokohama (Japan) and Quanzhou (China), each 
designated an East Asian City of Culture in 2013; and 
Hue (Vietnam) nominated ASEAN City of Culture in 
2014. In all these cities, culture is seen as a major lever 
for increasing tourism and investment, as well as, often, 
achieving social development, urban regeneration and 
economic growth at both the urban and national scales. 
This is clearly an instrumental view of culture, which 
many in the arts might wish to resist, and brings with 
it the danger of the commodification of culture while 
leaving structural inequalities untouched (discussed in 
Section 13.5.3), but as we shall see culture is also seen as 
a route through which to foster inclusive social develop-
ment, and to create dialogue, understanding and respect 
between peoples (UNESCO 2013). Culture is thus a ter-
rain in which politics, culture and the economic form an 
inseparable dynamic (Radcliffe 2007).
Modern consumption is also a cultural process and 
also depends overwhelmingly on image (for example, 
the marketing of food and drink products and fashion 
clothing) (see Plate 13.1). Movements around the world 
of images, symbols, modes of thought and communica-
tions are unparalleled in terms of their volume, speed 
and complexity. As computer technology, video imagery 
and electronic music demonstrate, the material world of 
commodities and technologies is profoundly cultural. In 
addition, culture has become increasingly commodified; 
in other words culture is being translated into material 
goods that can be marketed and sold. We can see this in 
Plate 13.1  Image marketing is central to popular 
consumption: the world of commodities is profoundly 
cultural.

264    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
Case study 13.1 
The globalization of culture:  
some examples
Fashion
Clothing is globalized both in terms of the cultural 
identities to which different items appeal (‘African’ 
prints, ‘Indian’ embroidery) and in terms of the global 
commodity chains through which they are produced 
and sold. Through multiple media including maga-
zines, television, blogs and websites, trends travel 
rapidly across the world. The production, distribu-
tion and consumption of clothing have a particular 
geography. Fashion design happens mainly in ‘global 
cities’ in the West, while the labour of cutting and 
day and the Gregorian calendar) and products (e.g. 
the motor car, television) from advanced countries, 
and their worldwide adoption (‘Westernization’, 
‘Americanization’, ‘modernization’). This is believed 
to create global cultural convergence – people around 
the world are becoming increasingly similar in terms 
of consumption, lifestyle, behaviour and aspirations 
(see Case study 13.1). It can be perceived positively 
(as ‘modernization’ or ‘development’) or negatively (as 
‘cultural imperialism’, where ‘we’ assume that others 
in the world should aspire to be like ‘us’).
2.	 The mixing, or hybridization, of cultures through 
greater interconnections and time–space compres-
sion (the shrinking of the world through transport 
links and technological innovation), leading to a new 
universal cultural practice. This challenges the notion 
of unidirectional ‘Westernization’ and allows us to 
consider how Western cultures have influenced and 
are also being influenced by this mixing of cultures. 
Flows of music, food, ideas, beliefs and literature 
continue to percolate from around the world into the 
cultures of the West. Consider, for example, cultural 
influences from the East: the global phenomenon of 
Korean K-Pop (Psy’s ‘Gangnam Style’ was a global hit 
in 2012); Japanese sushi being sold in North American 
and European supermarkets; the popularity of tradi-
tional Chinese medicines (such as acupuncture) and 
martial arts (such as karate, aikido and judo), which 
originate in East Asian spiritual traditions; the increas-
ing popularity of the thirteenth century Persian poet 
Rumi or the teachings of Jewish Kabbalah.
In reality, both these processes are flawed explanations 
for what is happening today. If a global culture exists, it 
is far from a product of unidirectional ‘Westernization’. 
However, alternative ideas about cultures mixing to pro-
duce a universal global culture are also problematic. Cul-
tures are mixing, but this does not necessarily mean we 
are all becoming the same.
around the world (e.g. an incident broadcast in a CNN 
news report, or an international sporting event), this event 
will be interpreted differently in different places. Further-
more, locality does not necessarily refer to the opposite of 
globality. For example, some environmentalists imagine 
the world as a locality, a ‘global village’. Cultural theo-
rists have a growing interest in how increasing globaliza-
tion, especially of cultural production and consumption, 
affects people’s sense of identity and place at both local 
and national levels (Goss 2006). Thus a geographic or spa-
tial perspective has become central to studies of culture 
more widely. These are some of the concerns that form 
the focus of this chapter. Subsequent sections explore in 
more detail ideas about a global culture, examine ways of 
rethinking local cultures, and explore progressive ways of 
thinking about cultures in contemporary contexts.
13.2 Towards a global culture?
13.2.1 Imagining a global culture
Processes of cultural globalization have a very long 
history and are not peculiar to contemporary times. 
Through global patterns of trade and migrations, and 
through the spread of religions and empires, people, 
objects and ideas have been circulating for centuries (see 
Chapters 1–3). However, contemporary globalization is 
distinctive in extent, form, rapidity of change, intensity 
and impact. Some commentators suggest that the idea of 
a global culture is becoming as meaningful as the idea of 
national or local cultures, with different places and cul-
tural practices around the world converging and becom-
ing ever similar. As Shurmer-Smith and Hannam (1994: 
76) argue, a global culture might be the product of two 
very different processes:
1.	 The export or diffusion of supposedly ‘superior’ cul-
tural traits (e.g. Western time-frames – the 24-hour 

Chapter 13  Geography, culture and global change     265
sewing is concentrated in the developing world. 
These divisions of labour illustrate the uneven dis-
tribution of the benefits of global cultural industries: 
while Western designers and models are glamorized 
and often handsomely rewarded, factory workers in 
Asia and Africa typically work long hours under harsh 
conditions for meagre pay (Crewe 2008). This une-
venness manifests not only along geographical lines 
but also along lines of gender. While men dominate 
the design industry, women are the main targets and 
consumers of fashion and also make up the major-
ity of clothing factory workers (see Dwyer 2006). 
This unevenness was exposed most dramatically by 
the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, 
Bangladesh in April 2013, killing over a thousand 
people, mainly women garment workers. The disaster 
exposed the appalling pay and working conditions 
of Bangladeshi women making clothes for brands 
such as Benetton, Mango, Primark and Walmart, and 
prompted protests at flagship stores in Europe and 
North America.
Food
Food has perhaps the longest history of globaliza-
tion of any cultural artefact. Spices, tea, and sugar 
are just three of the commodities whose trade have 
shaped our modern global economies. The globali-
zation of food cultures is exemplified in the idea, 
famously put forward by the British Foreign Secre-
tary, Robin Cook, in 2001 that chicken tikka masala 
was now the British national dish (The Guardian 
19/04/01). Equally, as India's own economy has 
boomed since the 1990s, that country's rapidly grow-
ing middle classes increasingly demand the local 
availability of ingredients and dishes that they have 
sampled elsewhere. Fast food and convenience food 
corporations are only too willing to fill this gap, and in 
the last five years chains including McDonalds, Krispy 
Kreme, Taco Bell and Burger King have all expanded 
or announced their plans to do so within the Indian 
market. Even as demand increases for exotic and 
more convenient foods, the environmental and politi-
cal geographies of what we eat have increasingly 
come under discussion. Growing consumer aware-
ness of the environmental impacts of food production 
and travel (food miles), and the potential health risks 
of mass agriculture and genetic modification have 
in many societies contributed what Jackson (2010a) 
calls ‘an age of anxiety’. In response, movements 
promoting locally produced, organic food and ‘slow’ 
food have emerged in many places. Similarly, con-
sumer recognition of the often exploitative nature of 
food production in developing countries has boosted 
sales of fair trade and other ‘ethical’ products in 
Western supermarkets. While these movements aim 
to break down unjust social divisions, we should also 
pay attention to the ways in which they may reinforce 
or re-shape identities of class (organic, ‘slow’ and 
fairly traded foods typically cost more) and under-
standings of ‘Third World’ producers as ‘other’ (Cook 
et al. 2010).
Tourism
Tourism is one of the most obvious forms of glo-
balization. Until relatively recently, the geography of 
tourism has been skewed, dominated by people of 
all classes from developed countries (North America, 
Western Europe, Japan and Australia). However, 
domestic and outbound tourism is now burgeoning in 
emerging economies with rapidly expanding middle 
classes. For example, in the past decade, Chinese 
domestic tourism had a continuous increase of 
around 10 per cent each year, and outbound tourism 
increased by 18 per cent from 2012 to 2013  
(www.travelchinaguide.com/tourism/ [accessed 15 
January 2015]). Domestic tourism in Brazil has more 
than doubled since 2004 (http://riotimesonline.com/

middle-class/ [accessed 15 January 2015]). Tourism 
can be exploitative, particularly through the growth 
of international sex tourism and the dependency of 
some developing economies on the exploitation of 
women. However, it is a form of international cultural 
exchange that allows vast numbers of people to expe-
rience other cultures and places. It also locks specific 
places (tourist destinations) into wider international 
cultural patterns. For example, the English Lake 
District ‘only really became part of England when 
many visitors, especially artists and writers, travelled 
to it from the metropolitan centre at the end of the 
eighteenth century onwards’ (Urry 2005: 80). Many 
key English writers became known as ‘Lake poets’ 
even when they were not from the area, and poets 
such as Wordsworth and Coleridge became tourist 
attractions, ‘locking’ the Lake District into a relation-
ship with broader ideas of landscape, literature and 
romance, which persists today as people from all over 
the world travel to the area on literary tours.

266    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
The enormous Indian film industry is very different to the 
global film industry (dominated by Hollywood) in terms 
of its level of informality, fragmentation and patterns of 
investment, reflecting contingent structural, cultural and 
geographic conditions (Mukherjee 2008), but it too has a 
global audience, particularly among the Indian diaspora. 
Similarly, there is a mosaic of urban and national scenes 
across Asia involving the production and consumption of 
putatively Asian cultural products, such as the Hong Kong 
and Korean film industries, Cantopop and Mandarin pop, 
Japanese manga and anime productions, and animation 
and digital media industries. The Nigerian movie indus-
try (Nollywood) is increasingly popular with audiences 
across Africa, to the extent that some film-makers and 
intellectuals elsewhere across the continent are critical 
of what they see as the ‘dumping’ of these rough-and-
ready videos in their national markets and the ‘pollution’ 
of their own cultural spaces (UNESCO 2013). Paradoxi-
cally, the circulation of these diverse cultural products is 
often enabled by apparently homogenizing technological 
platforms such as YouTube and Facebook (see Case study 
13.2). What is certainly clear, however, is that given the 
significant growth of the middle classes in countries such 
13.2.2 Debunking global culture?
A different departure point for discussing global culture is 
that there is no such thing. Ideas about a singular global 
economy, politics and culture imply some sort of world-
wide commonality that does not exist. First, the image of 
rampant cultural imperialism by the West, and especially 
the USA, is flawed since apparent cultural sameness is lim-
ited in scope, located only in the consumption of certain 
products and media images. The possibilities of ‘Westerni-
zation’ eroding centuries of local histories, languages, tra-
ditions and religions are far-fetched and people in different 
parts of the world respond to these images and products 
in different ways. On the one hand, many millions of peo-
ple are not able even to access the Internet. For example, in 
2009, there were on average only about 4 Internet users per 
1,000 people in Bangladesh and about 40 per 1,000 people 
in Malawi, compared with 770 per 1,000 in the USA and 
905 per 1,000 in the Netherlands (CIA World Factbook 
2014). There is no single global culture in part because of 
the unevenness of globalization. On the other hand, it is 
also important to acknowledge the cultural dynamism and 
assertiveness of countries and peoples around the world. 
Case study 13.2 
Culture and social networking
Since their introduction in the early twenty-first cen-
tury, social network sites (SNSs) such as MySpace, 
Facebook, Bebo and Cyworld have attracted mil-
lions of users, many of whom have integrated these 
sites into their daily practices. At one level, we might 
think of the globalization of SNSs as evidence of 
an emerging global culture. However, while the tech-
nological phenomenon has a global reach (with the 
caveat outlined previously that millions of people still 
do not have access to the Internet), the ways in which 
people around the world make cultural responses to 
SNSs are complex and multiple. As Boyd and Ellison 
(2007) argue (see also Miller 2011), while their 
key technological features are fairly consistent, the 
cultures that emerge around SNSs are varied. For 
example, most sites help maintain pre-existing social 
networks, but others enable strangers to connect with 
each other based on shared interests, political views 
or activities. Some sites deliberately cater to diverse 
and heterogeneous audiences, while others attract 
people based on common language or shared identi-
ties, such as ethnic, sexual, religious or nationality-
based identities. Sites also vary in the extent to which 
they incorporate new information and communica-
tion tools, such as mobile connectivity, blogging and 
photo/video-sharing.
The question of whether and how much cultural 
differences impact upon the way people respond to 
and interact with social networks is an important one. 
It could be argued, for example, that networks such as 
Facebook mainly reflect and accommodate values and 
norms prevalent in Western cultures, which explains 
why they were at first more successful in countries such 
as the UK, USA and Canada than elsewhere. However, 
the design and use of SNSs also varies in different 
locations and are often adapted to local cultural norms, 
tastes and preferences. For example, the page design 
of SNSs varies from place to place, with greater use of 
pastel or muted colours and emoticons on South-east 
Asian sites, in contrast to the bolder, darker colours used 
by sites in Europe and North America. Different cultural 
expectations around privacy and personal modesty also 
shape the use of SNSs. For example, some users are 
often uncomfortable with posting pictures of themselves, 
preferring to use avatars. Therefore, while technologies 
such as SNSs become increasingly global, local and 
national cultural norms continue to shape how people 
use social networking.

13.2.3 Rethinking global culture
Instead of imagining a global culture that is erasing local 
and national cultures, we can think of local, national and 
global as three important, interconnected spatial scales 
at which culture operates. Those aspects of culture that 
operate at the global level are ‘third cultures’ (Feather-
stone 1995: 114). National institutions are no longer in 
complete control of cultural globalization and ‘third 
cultures’ (sets of practices, bodies of knowledge, con-
ventions and lifestyles) have developed in ways that have 
become increasingly global and independent of nation-
states. Phenomena such as patterns of consumption, 
technological diffusion and media empires are part of 
these third cultures, and transnational and multinational 
corporations are the institutions that make them global. 
In this sense, global cultures exist but only as third cul-
tures, outside national and local cultures, yet intersecting 
on both these scales in different ways around the world.
Acknowledging that ‘our’ global view might be very 
different from that of people elsewhere, living in very dif-
ferent contexts, is also important. It is clear that multiple 
global cultural networks exist, such as those connecting 
the overseas Chinese with their homeland, or those link-
ing Islamic groups around the world. These networks 
disrupt any notion of a singular global culture. Power 
and inequality bring into question the idea of global 
cultures. As Massey (2009) argues, a power geometry 
exists, which gives people with different access to power 
different notions of what global means. New institu-
tions (like global media corporations) for the production, 
transmission and reception of cultural products are cre-
ating infrastructures supporting cultural globalization, 
including electronic infrastructure (radio, television, 
music, telecommunications, digital platforms), linguistic 
infrastructure (the spread of bi- and multi-lingualism, 
particularly the dominance of English), and corporate 
infrastructure (producers and distribution networks). 
As we have seen, these new institutions often operate at 
scales beyond the nation-state, and they are sites of power 
in the production of culture. The ownership, control 
and use of these institutions remain uneven across and 
within countries (Held and McGrew 2007), thus creating 
‘power geometries’ that are centred overwhelmingly on 
the West. People have very different experiences of cul-
ture because of their different locations in the world and 
their relationship to these sites of power. Mapping this 
power geometry, identifying sites of power and revealing 
the marginalization of some peoples around the world 
by cultural globalization are increasingly significant. Of 
equal significance are forms of resistance, such as cul-
ture jamming (Dery 2010) by anti-consumerist social 
movements. This involves tactics such as media hacking, 
as Brazil, Nigeria, India and China, the notion of West-
ern global cultural dominance is becoming increasingly 
anachronistic.
Second, some theorists would argue that national 
cultures remain stronger than global cultures. This is 
borne out when we consider the many conflicts occur-
ring throughout the world along the geopolitical fault-
lines of national cultures (the ongoing conflict between 
Pakistan and India is but one example of this). For 
the past 200 years, nation-states and national cultures 
have monopolized cultural power (state television 
is one example of a national institution influencing 
national cultures within national territorial bounda-
ries). At the end of the twentieth century, this balance 
began to change, with international telecommunica-
tions and media corporations challenging the centrality  
and importance of national cultures. However, it 
could be argued that despite these changes a great deal 
of ­cultural life is still organized along national and 
­territorial lines.
Third, if culture is a system of shared meanings, then 
looking at the world today there are clearly many sys-
tems of shared meanings and many different cultures. 
People in different places use different techniques and 
technologies to reproduce culture, such as oral histo-
ries, literature or television and cinema. These tech-
niques have different patterns of dispersion, penetration 
and scale. Therefore, some cultures are more likely to 
become globalized than others – those reproduced 
through television, cinema and increasingly through 
digital media platforms have a greater range and speed 
of dispersion than those reproduced through oral his-
tories. However, this does not mean that globalized 
cultures completely erode localized cultures; the ways 
in which these different cultures intersect is important. 
Those ‘things’ (products, symbols, corporate entities) 
that have become global signifiers are clearly globalized 
(they are recognized the world over), but the ways in 
which people around the world make cultural responses 
to them are complex and multiple (see Case study 13.2). 
Globalization of products and symbols does not nec-
essarily equal Westernization. For example, Japanese 
consumer goods do not sell on the back of exporting 
Japanese culture but on a market strategy based around 
the concept of dochaku (‘glocalism’). This involves a 
global strategy not of imposing standardized products 
but of tailoring Japanese consumer products to specific 
local markets. These goods are, therefore, both glo-
balized and localized. Consequently, how intersections 
between cultures are played out at local levels is of sig-
nificance, and this suggests that imagining a universal 
global culture is quite problematic.

268    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
‘new claims to the – usually exclusive – character of 
places, and who belongs there, are being made.’ We see 
this in contemporary Western Europe, North America 
and Australia, where ‘asylum seekers, migrants, Muslims, 
militant youths, pan-handlers, carriers of transmissible 
diseases’ (Amin 2010: 10) are increasingly racialized and 
viewed as threats to established value systems and ways 
of life. Similar problems have also emerged in countries 
such as South Africa, which experienced a dramatic rise 
in xenophobic violence in 2008 that persists today (Dod-
son 2010). Therefore, modern life is characterized both 
by decentralization and globalization of culture and by 
the resurgence of place-bound traditions. Following this, 
the impact of the new global context on local cultures has 
two, possibly contradictory, outcomes.
13.3.2 Negative sense of culture
Where global processes are perceived to pose a threat to 
local culture, there might be an attempt to return to some 
notion of the exclusivity of culture. At the extreme, this 
might take the form of exclusivist nationalism or even 
‘ethnic cleansing’. Reactions to the perceived threat to 
local cultures include nationalistic, ethnic and funda-
mentalist responses, which also entail a strong asser-
tion of local cultures, such as reviving or inventing local 
traditions and ceremonies. These can create a level of 
local fragmentation, with a parochial, nostalgic, inward-
looking sense of local attachment and cultural identity. 
In this sense, cultures are thought of as bounded, with 
very clear definitions of ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ in the 
creation of a sense of belonging, and producing geogra-
phies of exclusion (Sibley 1995).
For example, English rural areas are often conceptual-
ized as the preserve of culture and identity (see Chapters 
11 and 12). This idea is mobilized through the myth of 
the ‘rural idyll’, in which rural village communities are 
portrayed as neighbourly and close-knit, with villagers 
perceived as having a deep-seated sense of local identity 
complemented by strong feelings of belonging (Garland 
and Chakraborti 2006), and in which rural cultures are 
thought of as timeless, unchanging and unaffected by 
global processes. This cosy vision of a peaceful country-
side excludes many people who live in rural areas, but 
do not fit this stereotype. Different notions of rural idyll 
create similar exclusions in other countries; for exam-
ple, Canada’s rural idyll is embedded within the colonial 
legacy of a white settler society (Cairns 2013). The myth 
of the English rural idyll deems travellers, environmen-
tal protesters, hunt saboteurs, people with alternative 
lifestyles and people from minority ethnic communities 
to be ‘outsiders’ and a threat to local cultures (Garland 
information warfare, satire, ‘terror-art’ and graffiti to 
invest advertisements, newscasts and other media arte-
facts with subversive meaning, or to refigure logos and 
product images in order to challenge what is considered 
as ‘cool’. Another form of resistance is exemplified in 
‘buycotts’, the purchasing of oppositional products aim-
ing to provide a socially acceptable alternative to a more 
powerful brand. A good example of this is Mecca Cola, 
marketed in the Middle East, Europe, Asia and Africa 
as providing a means of expressing solidarity with Mus-
lims worldwide (Littler 2008). Promoted as an alternative 
to the archetypal American product Coca-Cola, Mecca 
Cola purports to offer consumers a way to subvert what 
the company sees as American imperialism, especially as 
displayed in the support offered by the USA to the Israeli 
occupation of Palestine and the US invasion of Iraq in 
2007. It is also important, therefore, to take account of 
the ways in which marginalized peoples might be empow-
ered by engaging with, and perhaps transforming, the 
new institutions driving cultural globalization.
In summary, global processes are occurring, but they 
do not produce a universal global culture, they are not 
distributed evenly around the world and are not uncon-
tested. Global cultural processes are not simply a result 
of a unidirectional ‘Westernization’, since culture flows 
transnationally. A number of different global cultures 
exist as ‘third cultures’ – in patterns of consumption, 
flows of knowledge, the diffusion of technologies and 
media empires that operate beyond, but connecting with, 
the local and national scales.
13.3 Reinventing local cultures?
13.3.1 Locality and culture
It has often been assumed that there is a simple relation-
ship between local place and local culture. Places were 
thought of as having a distinct physical, economic and 
cultural character; they were unique, with their own 
traditions and local cultures that made them different 
from other places. It is clear, however, that processes of 
globalization are also posing serious challenges to the 
meaning of place. Places and cultures are being restruc-
tured. According to Massey and Jess (1995a: 1), ‘on the 
one hand, previous coherences are being disrupted, old 
notions of the local place are being interrupted by new 
connections with a world beyond’. The appearance of 
7–11 stores in the rainforests of northern Thailand is one 
example of how even the remotest of places are becom-
ing increasingly internationalized, in this case through 
tourism. ‘On the other hand’, Massey and Jess continue, 

Chapter 13  Geography, culture and global change     269
cultural identity and its boundaries. Women are often the 
intergenerational transmitters of cultural traditions, cus-
toms, songs, cuisine and the ‘mother’ tongue, primarily 
through their role as mothers. This is especially true in 
minority situations where the school and the public sphere 
present different and dominant cultural models from that 
of the home. Recent controversies over the Islamic veil, for 
example, have seen countries across Europe wrestling with 
issues of religious freedom, civil rights, women’s equality, 
secular traditions and escalating fears of terrorism. France 
banned Muslim headscarves and other ‘conspicuous’ reli-
gious symbols at state schools in 2004, and in 2010 made 
it illegal in public places to wear any clothes designed 
to hide the face. Belgium passed a similar law in 2010, 
banning any clothing that hides the wearer’s identity in 
public places. Turkey, a secular Islamic country, banned 
the wearing of head-scarves in all civic spaces in 2005 but 
amended the ruling in 2008 to allow women at universi-
ties to wear scarves tied under the chin. The Italian par-
liament approved anti-terrorist laws in July 2005, which 
make covering one’s features in public – including through 
wearing the burqa – an offence. The Dutch cabinet backed 
a proposal in 2006 to ban the few dozen Muslim women 
who choose to wear the burqa from doing so in public 
places on grounds that it disturbs public order, citizens 
and safety. In the United Kingdom in 2010, the Conserva-
tive MP Philip Hollobone proposed a law to regulate 
wearing in public garments that cover the face, calling 
the burqa offensive. The debates over Islamic dress reveal 
some of the issues that can arise when marginal, minority 
cultures are seen to clash with the norms and expectations 
of the majority population, which in turn raises questions 
about the possibilities and challenges of multiculturalism 
as opposed to integration and/or assimilation (discussed 
below in Section 13.4).
and Chakraborti 2004). The pervasiveness of this myth 
of the white rural idyll made headlines in the UK in a 
recent controversy over the cast of popular TV drama 
Midsomer Murders, set in a fictional Cotswolds village. 
When questioned about the all-white cast, the producer 
described the programme as the ‘last bastion of Eng-
lishness’ and stated ‘We just don't have ethnic minori-
ties involved. Because it wouldn't be the English village 
with them’ (in Pool 2011). As Garland and Chakraborti 
(2006, 2009) argue, the perpetuation of this myth 
obscures and marginalizes the experiences of minority 
ethnic residents who often feel excluded from village 
life. Moreover, their research suggests that conflation 
of rurality with notions of Englishness and ‘whiteness’ 
serves to reinforce this marginalization and can also lead 
to racist victimization. The ‘rural idyll’ is thus a selec-
tive representation, exclusive in its class, race and status 
connotations, is profoundly conservative and demands 
conformity. It is based on a very inward-looking sense 
of place and culture (see Plate 13.2).
Conservative reactions to change can be thought of 
as a kind of cultural fundamentalism through which the 
process of cultural change is often bitterly contested. 
Gender plays an important role in this. Women are often 
considered as guardians of the borders of culture (Yuval-
Davis 1997). They not only bear children for the collec-
tive, but also reproduce it culturally. In closed cultures, 
the control of women’s sexuality is seen as imperative to 
the maintenance of the purity of the cultural unit; women 
are discouraged from marrying outside their cultural and 
ethnic group. Ethnicity and culture, therefore, are seen 
to be one and the same. In addition, symbols of gender 
play an important role in articulating difference between 
cultural groups. Women’s distinctive ways of dressing 
and behaving very often come to symbolize the group’s

tolerant of difference). Increasing interconnectedness 
means the boundaries of local cultures are seen to be 
more permeable, susceptible to change, and difficult 
to maintain than in the past. Rather than everywhere 
becoming the same, some nation-states have reconsti-
tuted their collective identities along pluralistic and 
multicultural lines, which take into account regional and 
ethnic differences and diversity. In Europe, this involves 
re-creation and invention of local, regional and sub-
state or new ‘national’ cultures (for example, the cul-
tural renaissance of the Basques and Catalans, or the 
cultural assertiveness of minority ethnic communities 
in cities such as London, Paris and Berlin). The 2014 
Scottish independence referendum saw Scots vote nar-
rowly to stay within the United Kingdom, but also saw 
the emergence of a powerful civic nationalism – gener-
ally a non-xenophobic nationalism (although paradoxi-
cally not without occasional anti-English sentiment) that 
purports to be based in values of freedom, tolerance, 
equality and rights – as opposed to ethnic nationalism 
based in notions of cultural sameness. Thus, what can 
be perceived as destruction of local cultures by globaliza-
tion might in fact be the means of creating new senses 
of locality and nation. This still involves notions of local 
and national identity, but recognizes both the differences 
between cultures and their interconnectedness, taking 
account of the positive aspects of cultural mixing and 
increased cosmopolitanism. This new sense of identity 
is based on notions of inclusion rather than exclusion.
This is not to say, of course, that all people within 
the same place will share the same culture and the same 
sense of locality. Within these more culturally pluralis-
tic and cosmopolitan locales, different class factions, 
ages, genders, ethnicities and religious groupings mingle 
together in the same sites, consuming the same television 
programmes and products, but in highly uneven ways. 
These groups often possess different senses of affiliation 
to places and localities, possess different cultural identi-
ties and belong to different cultural groupings (Feather-
stone 1995: 97). A progressive sense of culture does not 
foresee the locale as a ‘melting-pot’, where everything 
becomes the same, but rather recognizes the different 
experiences of people, and that increasing interconnec-
tions might create new, dynamic and exciting cultural 
forms. An understanding of this is crucial to the creation 
of a progressive notion of place and culture, which recog-
nizes cultures as fluid, dynamic, open and interconnected, 
and accepts that older local cultures might decline as new 
ones emerge.
In summary, localities are important in maintain-
ing cultural difference, but can also be sites of cultural 
mixing and transformation. Ideas about culture can be 
negative (bounded, fixed, inward-looking) or positive 
Societies do not evolve smoothly from closed, bounded 
perceptions of culture to more open, dynamic notions. 
The question of cultural power, identity and resistance 
also needs to be considered. For many groups, cultural 
survival is seen to depend on a closed idea of culture, with 
strongly marked boundaries separating it from ‘others’. 
The controversies over Islamic dress, and the continu-
ing sectarianism and possible threats of terrorism that 
still exist in Northern Ireland despite recent progress, 
are examples of different cultures, religions and national 
identities colliding with each other. Elsewhere the mix-
ing of cultures under the impact of globalization is often 
seen as threatening and as weakening the sense of cultural 
identity. Immigration is seen as a particular threat, cre-
ating a revival of ethnicity that cuts across the political 
spectrum. Examples include the ‘little England’ reaction 
to closer European integration, encapsulated by the rise 
of the UK Independence Party, which campaigns on a 
platform of UK withdrawal from the European Union 
and imposing strict controls on immigration. Migrants 
to Britain have become scapegoats for almost every con-
temporary problem, from the squeeze on public finances 
and services, the declining economy, and the increasing 
numbers of working poor. Similar attitudes are evident 
in post-apartheid South Africa, where since 1994 African 
immigrants have been associated with illegality, criminal-
ity and a struggling welfare system, in both political and 
public discourse. According to one commentator, ‘The 
poor and the vulnerable – especially those who do not 
share the same language or customs or religion – have 
always been a politically convenient scapegoat for a soci-
ety’s various ills. It’s the oldest trick in the book’ (Fraser 
2014). It is also a means of turning those most affected 
by economic downturns and government austerity meas-
ures (e.g. working and lower middle classes) against 
other increasingly marginalised groups. This trend can 
be observed in the rise of neo-fascism across Europe, 
also characterized by anti-immigration and racism. Per-
ceived threats to religious identities have also witnessed 
the strengthening of Islamic and Christian fundamental-
ism around the world. These phenomena are not all the 
same, but they do share a response to globalization that 
involves a closed, fixed, bounded and often place-specific 
definition of culture, and a strong resistance to changes 
heralded by cultural globalization.
13.3.3 Positive sense of culture
A more positive response to global processes would be 
to imagine cultures as fluid, ever-changing, unbounded, 
overlapping and outward-looking – akin to Massey’s 
(1994: 151) ‘progressive sense of place’. This involves 
people being more cosmopolitan (free of prejudice and 

Chapter 13  Geography, culture and global change     271
of unemployment, discrimination in housing and jobs 
markets, and police harassment (see Chapter 10); the 
2011 London riots have been blamed on racism, classism 
and economic inequality that are seen as linked to crimi-
nality, breakdown of social morality and gang culture.
In contrast, a more progressive idea of culture (and its 
manifestations in ethnicity, gender and sexuality) might 
be developed through the concept of hybridity. Hybrid-
ity breaks down barriers, adhering to neither the ‘melt-
ing pot’ nor ‘mosaic’ idea of cultural mixing, but rather 
seeing different cultures coming together and inform-
ing each other in different ways to produce something 
entirely new. This process has a long historical trajectory. 
Indeed, some argue that cultures have always been hybrid 
forms and processes – they have never existed in isolation 
from other cultures, and thus have always been subject to 
change and influences from elsewhere (Werbner 1997: 15).
One of the most obvious places we can observe 
hybridity is in popular mass culture, an immediate 
example being popular music. Innovations in music have 
always involved the fusion of different styles to create 
new sounds and rhythms. Rock-and-roll, rhythm-and-
blues and Latin jazz are obvious examples. We might also 
think of recent and contemporary forms of music that 
fuse different styles, such as ‘trip hop’, which emerged in 
the 1990s; ‘post-trip hop’, which has since integrated trip 
hop with other genres, such as ambient, R&B, breakbeat, 
drum ‘n’ bass, acid jazz and new age; ‘nu metal’, which 
from the late 1990s until around 2005 combined heavy 
metal with other genres such as grunge and hip hop; and 
electro house, which fuses house music with several other 
electronic dance music subgenres and came into promi-
nence between 2000 and the present. Theorists such as 
Barthes (1972), Bourdieu (1984) and Bakhtin (1984) see 
popular hybridity as an exciting challenge to, or subver-
sion of, dominant cultures and the exclusive lifestyles of 
dominant elites. Such popular mixings and inversions, 
like the subversive elements of youth cultures (Hebdige 
1979; see also Hammett 2009; Carr 2010), are hybrid in 
the sense that they bring together and mix languages and 
practices from different and normally separated domains. 
They have the potential to disrupt dominant cultures by 
their ‘out-of-placeness’.
In many ways hybridity is related to the notion of 
transculturation. Transculturation describes one of 
the key cultural processes that operate between hitherto 
sharply differentiated cultures and peoples who are forced 
(usually by the processes of imperialism or globaliza-
tion, and primarily through migration) to interact. This 
interaction often takes place in profoundly asymmetrical 
ways in terms of relative power between different groups. 
However, communication technologies that enable simul-
taneous connections and transactions between people in 
(progressive, dynamic, outward-looking). Bounded, fixed 
notions of culture can lead to localized resistance, rac-
ism, nationalism, and even ‘ethnic cleansing’. Progressive 
ideas about culture involve the recognition of differences 
between cultures, the interconnectedness of cultures and 
their constant evolution.
13.4 Multi- and hybrid cultures?
13.4.1 Hybridity
One of the major contemporary challenges concerns 
what we do with the concept of culture in the changing 
global scene, where nation-states are forced to tolerate 
greater diversity within their boundaries. Some want to 
see national identity as homogeneous and assimilatory – 
in other words, different cultures are subsumed into the 
dominant culture (the ‘melting pot’ idea) (see Case study 
13.3). Denmark, for example, is highly assimilationist 
and has one of the toughest policies on immigration in 
Europe. Others call for the acceptance of ethnic plural-
ism and the preservation of minority ethnic cultures as a 
legitimate part of the national project. This is the politics 
of multiculturalism, which instead of thinking of dif-
ferent cultures as being absorbed by dominant cultures, 
relies more on a notion of a cultural mosaic, or a ‘patch-
work quilt’ of cultures. Each culture is recognized as dif-
ferent and distinct, but these differences are understood 
and valued. Sweden, for example, rejects Denmark’s 
assimilationist model in favour of multiculturalism.
Multiculturalism might seem more progressive, but it 
can sometimes reinforce difference because culture is seen 
as essentially connected to race, and racial difference as 
rooted in biological difference. (These ideas are no longer 
considered acceptable; anti-racists have demonstrated 
that ‘race’ is socially constructed and has little basis in 
biology (Price 2010). We could just as easily have ‘races’ 
of blue-eyed and brown-eyed people.) Multiculturalism, 
therefore, still relies on a negative notion of bounded 
cultures. It might suggest tolerance, but often results 
in segregation and ghettoization. The United Kingdom 
and Netherlands, for example, have tended towards mul-
ticulturalism but have increasingly witnessed tensions 
surrounding the lack of integration of some Muslim 
communities. The murder of Dutch film-maker Theo 
Van Gogh in 2004, the London bombings in July 2005 
and the attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo 
in Paris in 2015 – all by apparent ‘home-grown radical 
Islamists’ – are seen by some to represent the failures of 
multiculturalism. Similarly, the 2006 riots in the suburbs 
of Paris were seen as a product of the deep alienation of 
poor, largely immigrant communities facing high levels

Bounded or hybrid national culture?
Nationalists around the world cling to a notion of 
bounded cultures that make them distinct from others. 
One effect of globalization has been resistance in the 
form of increased nationalism to what is perceived to 
be the erosion of national cultures. Increased mixing 
of cultures is seen to pose a threat to the survival of 
national cultures. Nationalists seek to preserve the 
symbols of nationhood, such as language, lifestyles 
and cultural forms, in the face of what are perceived 
to be sweeping changes. However, cultures are not 
unchanging; a fundamental flaw in nationalist ideology 
(especially ethnic nationalism) is the adherence to a 
notion of static culture, and its reliance on a mythical 
history of the origin of the nation. For example, Eng-
lish nationalists define Englishness as distinct, which 
is used to justify anti-immigrationist ideas, anti-Euro-
peanism and, in some cases, racism. But who are ‘the 
English’? After the last ice age many communities 
settled Britain and Ireland from all over Europe. They 
lived and fought with each other and in a short space 
of time produced a mixed group of people who even-
tually called themselves English. The islands have 
been subject to waves of invasion and settlement (e.g. 
Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Normans). 
England has always been hybrid; peoples and cul-
tures have mixed and evolved together. Some English 
nationalists avoid thinking about this point by arguing 
that the final invasion (by William the Conqueror in 
1066) marks the origin of England and Englishness 
(Anderson 1983). This myth is also flawed. William the 
Conqueror spoke no English. Whom did he conquer? 
He conquered ‘the English’. For many nationalists 
the founding father of England is French! It is also no 
small irony that one of the symbols of Englishness, 
the monarchy, changed its official name to Windsor 
in 1917 from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, thus hiding its 
German origins.
Even protectionist policies towards language are 
flawed; as with culture more generally, language is 
always hybridised and evolving. Most sentences in ‘Eng-
lish’ contain words that derive from German, French, 
Spanish, Latin, Nordic and Celtic languages. One legacy 
of British imperialism has been the incorporation of ele-
ments of the languages of the colonized into everyday 
English. Words from Indian languages, for example, 
punctuate English, including Hindi (bangle, bazaar, cara-
van, cot, jungle, juggernaut, pajama, pundit, shampoo, 
thug), Sanskrit (atoll, aubergine, avatar, bandana, candy, 
cash, dinghy, karma, sugar), Tamil (catamaran, curry, 
mantra, pariah), and Urdu (bungalow, khaki). Technologi-
cal innovation introduces not only new words, but has 
the capacity to alter grammar: verbalising nouns (adding 
endings to nouns that turn them into verbs, such as ‘tex-
ting’, ‘emailing’, ‘googling’, ‘interfacing’) is now common-
place in British English. Such hybridity within national 
languages provides evidence for the ways in which cul-
tures have always been dynamic and mutually influential. 
Similar myths of origin and notions of bounded cultures 
exist elsewhere in the world. In some places protectionist 
policies emanate from deeply contradictory ideas (anti-
immigrationist views in the USA and Australia, for exam-
ple). In other places notions of bounded culture have 
led to conflict (for example, between Georgia and South 
Ossetia in 2008, between the Tamil separatists and the 
Sri Lankan state in 2009, and the continuing struggle by 
Kurdish nationalist organizations, some of whom seek to 
create an independent nation-state of Kurdistan, consist-
ing of some or all of the Kurdish areas in eastern Turkey, 
northern Iraq, north-western Iran and northern Syria, 
while others campaign for greater Kurdish autonomy 
within these existing national boundaries). The idea of 
nationhood, based on fixed, bounded and unchanging 
cultures, is an ideological creation that masks profound 
cultural divisions of gender, race, class and religion within 
a nation-state (see also Chapter 22), and ignores the fact 
that, in reality, all cultures are hybrid and dynamic.
even remote parts of the world are creating the possibil-
ity for more democratic forms of intercultural exchange. 
For example, intercultural exchange between schools and 
universities in different parts of the world is increasingly 
popular, facilitated by digital technologies. This has ena-
bled such things as intercultural music-making, which 
promotes knowledge of and respect for cultural diversity, 
as well as stimulating creativity of hybrid musical forms. 
One example of an intercultural exchange between 
Tswana university students in South Africa and students 
in an Australian university (Klopper 2010) promoted a 
better understanding of their own and other musical tra-
ditions – the centrality in African cultures of music to 
tradition and oral histories, its inseparability from other 
performance arts and its links to joy and shared experi-
ence, in contrast to the technical training and individual 
mastery of classical music by Western students (which 
classical musicians might point out also becomes joyful

throughout history (see Case study 13.3) and it may be 
that new technologies simply speed up the process and 
enhance the possibilities. However, for those who aspire 
to bounded notions of culture and refuse this idea of per-
petual hybridity, cultural mixing is felt to be threatening 
and a deliberate challenge to social order. In reality there 
are no fixed cultures in modern nation-states, but some 
people cling to ideas of pure or impure cultures. For oth-
ers, however, hybridity remains the site of revitalization, 
resistance and fun (see Case study 13.4).
and shared when played in an orchestra). Digital and 
communication technologies (video, on-line chat rooms 
and web-cams) also allowed the students to collaborate 
in making music together. As Klopper (2010: 48) argues, 
such technologies ensure that ‘cultural boundaries are no 
longer geographically dictated’.
Despite the illusion of boundedness, cultures have 
always evolved historically through borrowings, appro-
priations, exchanges and inventions. Cross-fertiliza-
tion of cultures is endemic to all movements of people

Hybridity/diaspora – some examples
Samba-taiko in São Paulo, Brazil
Samba-taiko is a hybrid form of music, combining the 
percussion styles of Japanese taiko (meaning ‘big 
drum’) and Brazilian samba, and a recent style of music 
emerging out of the Japanese diaspora in Brazil. Taiko 
performances are highly visual, visceral, and energetic 
in dynamics, rhythm, and movement, with dramatic 
full-body choreography and highly stylized strokes and 
arm movements. Solo taiko has its origins in ancient 
rituals, linked to Buddhism and everyday life. Taiko 
ensemble drumming is a relatively recent development 
in Japanese musical culture, which has allowed it to be 
appropriated and developed independently in Japanese 
migrant communities in both North and Latin America. 
São Paulo, home to the largest Japanese diaspora, 
has become the site of an emerging hybridization of 
Brazilian and Japanese percussion instrumentation and 
styles, which is also changing function of this music 
as cultural identity. Samba is a central part of Brazilian 
national identity (brasilidade), referring to both the musi-
cal style and the place or circle in which the music is 
placed, either in the home (casa) or in the street (rua). 
A popular idiom used to refer to ‘playing badly’ is ‘the 
Japanese in the samba’, which is symbolic of a wider 
exclusion of the Japanese diaspora from the notion of 
brasilidade. After a century of immigration, people of 
Japanese descent in Brazil are not considered ‘Brazil-
ian’ in popular discourse, and are regularly referred to 
as ‘Japanese’. Samba-taiko originated in São Paolo 
with Setsuo Kinoshita, the first taiko professor in Brazil, 
who began teaching both taiko and samba in an effort 
to help Brazilian-Japanese students deal with exclusion 
and internalized racism, and to become more comforta-
ble with their dual identities. In 2003, Kinoshota and his 
students began performing their innovations in hybrid 
samba-taiko styles (see, for example, Kinoshita's video 
clip at www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuVSB67IDgg), 
sparking a craze in Brazil, and inspiring the formation 
of over 150 taiko groups in which young Japanese and 
non-Japanese Brazilians come together through music. 
Through a shared tradition of percussion, it appears 
that a truly Japanese-Brazilian cultural rapport, particu-
larly among young people, is emerging after a century 
of cultural disconnect.

Cuban Santería
Santería is an example of a syncretic (hybrid, mixed) 
religion. It is based on West African religions brought by 
slaves imported from what are now Nigeria and Benin 
to the Caribbean to work the sugar plantations. These 
religions were suppressed by the European planta-
tion owners and in Cuba slaves were forced to convert 
to Catholicism. However, they were able to preserve 
some of their traditions by fusing together various West 
African beliefs and rituals and syncretizing these with 
elements from Catholicism. One factor enabling this 
process was that many of the orishas (primary gods) 
shared many of the same characteristics of Catholic 
saints. This enabled slaves to appear to be practising 
Catholicism while practising their own religions. This has 
evolved into what we know today as Santería, the Way 
of the Saints, whose traditions are transmitted orally 
from generation to generation. Despite suppression by 
Fidel Castro's Socialist Revolution since 1961, its influ-
ence is pervasive in Cuban life. Devotees are found in 
most households, Yoruba proverbs litter Cuban Span-
ish, and high priests (babalawos) offer guidance based 
on ancient systems of lore. Today, with less religious 
persecution, Santería is experiencing a rise in popularity 
and is part of an emerging Cuban youth culture. Similar 
syncretic religions are found in Haiti, Puerto Rico and 
other Caribbean and Latin American countries.

images to attract investment in the form of business and 
tourism. Hybrid culture is perceived as creating economic 
advantage. With increasing deindustrialization in Europe 
and North America, and many countries in the global 
South by-passing an industrial age to fast-forward to a 
knowledge- and service-driven economy, cultural strate-
gies have become key to the survival of cities. Examples 
include the international marketing of cultural/religious 
festivals such as Mardi Gras in Sydney or New Orleans, 
Gay Pride Festivals in Toronto, Cape Town or London, or 
the importance of ‘Chinatowns’ and other ‘ethnic’ districts 
to tourism in cities throughout the world (see Plate 13.3). 
Ironically, hybridity is in danger of becoming just another 
marketable commodity. For example, treating the political 
work of some British-Asian bands as marketable, hybrid-
ity trivializes black political activity and leaves problems 
of class exploitation and racial oppression unresolved. As 
Hutnyk (1997: 134) suggests, to focus on hybridity while 
ignoring (or as an excuse for ignoring) the conditions in 
which this phenomenon exists (the commodity system, 
global economic inequality, inequitable political rela-
tions) is problematic in that it maintains the status quo. 
Hybridity and difference sell, but in the meantime the mar-
ket remains intact, power relations remain unequal, and 
marginalized peoples remain marginalized. Moreover, as 
culture is subsumed into capitalism, those marginalized 
peoples who might be capable of oppositional politics are 
also subsumed under the rubric of hybridity.
The notion of hybridity, therefore, can be problem-
atic. In some Latin American countries, cultural elites 
and nation-states have appropriated the hybrid mestizo 
(mixed) identity, making it dominant. This has been 
seen to be oppressive of ‘Indian’ populations, who have 
in turn been accused of ethnic essentialism (or empha-
sizing their racial difference) because of their desire to 
13.4.2 Diaspora
Related to the idea of hybridity is the notion of diaspora. 
This term was originally used to refer to the dispersal of 
Jewish peoples, but is now used in reference to the long-
term settlement of peoples in ‘foreign’ places that follows 
their scattering or dispersal from their original homeland. 
It refers to a modern condition where a sense of belong-
ing is not derived from attachment to territory, and where 
different peoples mix together through the processes of 
migration (forced or free). European imperialism and 
associated processes of globalization have set many of 
these migrations in motion. Diasporas are classic contact 
zones – spaces in which two cultures come together and 
influence each other – where transculturation or hybridi-
zation takes place. Diasporic identities are at once local 
and global and based on transnational identifications 
encompassing both ‘imagined’ and ‘encountered’ com-
munities (e.g. Irish-Americans belong to an imagined 
international community of people who have ‘Irishness’ 
in common, but whose identities are also informed by 
the communities in which they live in the USA). In other 
words, diasporas are a direct challenge to the idea that 
there is a simple relationship between place and culture. 
They transgress the boundaries of the nation-state and 
provide alternative resources for constructing identity 
and fashioning culture.
The concept of diaspora space allows us to think of 
‘culture as a site of travel’ (Clifford 1992), which seriously 
problematizes the idea of a person being a ‘native’ or an 
‘insider’. Diaspora space is the point at which boundaries 
of inclusion and exclusion, of belonging and otherness, 
of ‘us’ and ‘them’ are contested. As Brah (1996: 209) 
argues, diaspora space is ‘inhabited’ not only by those 
who have migrated and their descendants, but equally 
by those who are constructed and represented as indig-
enous or ‘native’. In the diaspora space called ‘England’, 
for example, African-Caribbean, Irish, Asian, Jewish and 
other diasporas intersect among themselves as well as 
with the entity constructed as ‘Englishness’, thoroughly 
reinscribing it in the process. Like notions of hybridity, 
the concept of diaspora is important since it allows for 
the recognition of new political and cultural formations 
that continually challenge the marginalizing impulses of 
dominant cultures.
13.4.3 Selling hybridity and the commodification  
of culture
In today’s world, culture sells. Hybrid cultures, in 
­particular, sell. Cities are now constructing themselves 
as ­cosmopolitan, and hybridity has become a form of 
­‘boosterism’ – where city authorities create marketing

Chapter 13  Geography, culture and global change     275
producing defensive and exclusionary actions and atti-
tudes, and why are the latter so difficult to transcend? Is 
the sheer pace of change in cultural globalization produc-
ing these reactions?
To summarize, hybridity and diaspora are examples of 
more progressive ways of thinking about culture. It could 
be argued that all cultures are always already hybrid; they 
are never pure, have always evolved and changed through 
time and through contact with other cultures, and they 
continue to evolve. In today’s world, hybridity is being 
commodified, which might make it less radical. However, 
despite this, it has the potential to democratize culture 
and to allow us to rethink culture in ways that are more 
tolerant of difference. Finally, cultural hybridity needs to 
be understood in the context of growing global uncer-
tainty, xenophobia and racism.
13.5 Conclusion
In this chapter it is suggested that there are two apparently 
contradictory tendencies in thinking about cultures – the 
attempt to secure the purity of a culture by conceptualiz-
ing it as strong, fixed, bounded, permanent and homoge-
neous, and the hybridity of most cultures. Culture is thus 
a contested concept. A progressive way of thinking about 
culture is to reject the idea of boundedness and inter-
nal cohesion. In the modern world especially, culture is a 
meeting point where different influences, traditions and 
forces intersect. There is, therefore, a continual process of 
change in cultural practices and meanings. Globalization 
is undermining closed, fixed ideas of culture and leading 
to new ways of conceptualizing cultures (transcultura-
tion, contact zones, hybridity and diaspora). However, 
the fact that cultures are not fixed or homogeneous does 
not mean that we will stop thinking of them in this way. 
As Hall (1995: 188–9) argues, this is because some people 
need ‘belongingness’ and the security that closed concep-
tions of culture provide.
Despite this, recent years have witnessed a decentring 
of culture, with nation-states increasingly superseded by 
transnational institutions that are producing cultural glo-
balization and greater cultural diversity. There has also 
been a shift in the awareness of the cultural capital of the 
West, and an understanding of the cultural dominance 
of developed countries. At the same time, there are now 
more voices talking back, reflecting the cultural asser-
tiveness of marginalized groups and making us aware of 
new levels of diversity. Even though most people remain 
physically, ideologically and spiritually attached to a 
local or a national culture and a local place, complex 
cultural flows and networks ensure that it is becoming 
protect their cultures (Radcliffe and Westwood 1996). In 
the West, ideas of hybridity are currently popular with 
highly educated cultural elites, but ideas about culture, 
ethnicity and identity that develop in poverty-stricken 
underclass neighbourhoods are likely to be of a differ-
ent nature (Friedman 1997: 83–4). Evidence of racial 
tensions in many North American and European cities 
points to the fact that class and local ghetto identities 
tend to prevail, with little room for the mixing pleaded 
for by cultural elites. Such fixed notions of identity are 
produced and perpetuated in wealthy areas too. In Cape 
Town, where urban segregation persists 20 years after the 
end of apartheid, several violent, racist incidents in pub-
lic spaces in predominantly white neighbourhoods made 
newspaper headlines in 2014. The global, cultural hybrid, 
elite sphere is occupied by individuals who share a very 
different kind of experience of the world, connected to 
international politics, academia, the media and the arts. 
In the meantime, the world becomes more polarized in 
terms of wealth, and heads towards increasing balkani-
zation where regional, national and ethnic identities are 
perceived as bounded, threatened, and in need of pro-
tection. As Bhabha (1994) reminds us, hybridity is an 
insufficient means through which to create new forms 
of collective identity that can overcome ethnic, racial, 
religious and class-based antagonisms – it sounds nice in 
theory, but does not necessarily exist outside the realms 
of the privileged.
As Stuart Hall (1996: 233) argued, we should not view 
the current fashionability of hybridity in a wholly nega-
tive light. Even as cultures are increasingly commodified, 
we should not forget the potential for the democratiza-
tion of culture in this process, the increased recognition 
of difference and the diversification of the social worlds 
in which people now operate – the case of samba-taiko 
in Brazil (Case study 13.4) is but one example. This plu-
ralization of social and cultural life expands the identi-
ties available to ordinary people (at least in the advanced 
economies) in their everyday working, social, familial and 
sexual lives. For Bhabha (1994: 9), the interconnections of 
different cultural spaces and the overlapping of different 
cultural forms create vitality and hold out the possibility 
of a progressive notion of culture.
We thus need to think about the place and meaning of 
cultural hybridity in the context of growing global uncer-
tainty, xenophobia (fear of foreigners) and racism. Why 
is cultural hybridity still experienced as an empower-
ing, dangerous or transformative force? Why, on the one 
hand, is difference celebrated through a consumer mar-
ket that offers a seemingly endless choice of identities, 
sub-cultures and styles yet, on the other hand, hybridity 
continues to threaten and shock? Conversely, why do bor-
ders, boundaries and ‘pure’ identities remain important, 

276    Section 3  Society, settlement and culture
increasingly impossible for people to live in places that 
are completely isolated and disconnected culturally from 
the wider world. Thus,
if there is a global culture it would be better to con-
ceive of it not as a common culture, but as a field in 
which differences, power struggles and cultural pres-
tige contests are played out . . . Hence globalization 
makes us aware of the sheer volume, diversity and 
many-sidedness of culture.
(Featherstone 1995: 14)
This points to a ‘more positive evaluation by the West 
of otherness and differences’ (Featherstone 1995: 89). For 
Massey and Jess (1995b: 134), globalization is not simply 
a threat to existing notions of culture, but a ‘stimulus to 
a positive new response’.
People around the world have different cultures and sys-
tems of meaning, but we cannot avoid reading the world 
from within our own cultures and interpreting it through 
our own systems of meaning. Understandings of global 
culture for the majority of the readers of this book are fil-
tered through the logic of the West (Spivak 1985). Western 
ideas and cultural forms are still considered superior and 
have become hegemonic, or dominant. Similarly, one’s own 
cultural positioning (on the basis of gender, ethnicity, class, 
location, sexuality, stage in life cycle, ability) also influ-
ences understandings of local cultures. The same processes 
operate at local levels; dominant cultures marginalize oth-
ers on the basis of ethnicity, sexuality, gender and religion. 
However, as we have seen, those dominant cultures also 
produce resistances that have the potential to create new 
ways of thinking about culture.
The challenge is to confront the limits of ‘our’ knowl-
edge, to recognize other worlds, to acknowledge the legit-
imacy of other cultures, other identities and other ways 
of life. Accepting ‘cultural translation’ (Bhabha 1994) 
involves understanding the hybrid nature of culture, the 
influence of marginal cultures on dominant cultures, and 
that people in marginal cultural systems at local, national 
and international levels are also active in creating their 
own systems of meaning. They do not simply absorb 
ideas from, or become absorbed into, more dominant 
cultures. It is possible to develop cosmopolitanism in the 
twenty-first century that is global, sensitive to cultural 
difference, and dynamic.
Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter, you should be able to:
● Understand the complexities of culture; it is a 
process, rather than a thing, and subject to change 
over time.
● Demonstrate ways in which cultures operate at 
local, national and global levels.
● Discuss examples of global cultural processes and 
how these are filtered through localities to contest 
notions of a singular global culture.
● Discuss examples of negative (closed, bounded), or 
positive (progressive, hybridized) local cultures.
● Critique and utilize concepts such as hybridity and 
diaspora as a progressive way of thinking about 
culture.
● Reflect on your own cultures of knowledge, and 
the ways in which these condition your ideas about 
global, national and local cultures.

Section 4
Production, exchange and consumption
Edited by Peter Daniels

The idea of going ‘global’ is often associated with 
the economic aspects of human geography. The 
geographical outcomes are increasingly a function 
of links and dependencies that extend far beyond 
the local or national; reflecting diverse and dynamic 
interactions between places and people distributed 
worldwide. The recent shift in the global economic 
centre of gravity towards China or India is a good 
example. Many of the symptoms of ‘globalization’ 
are most obvious in the sphere of consumption 
(Chapter 19); Apple (USA) or BMW (Germany) are 
universal brands, although not equally accessible 
everywhere. This is also the case, although per-
haps less obvious, in the context of global food 
production and consumption (Chapter 15).
Consumption is both a consequence, and a driver, 
of the globalization of production. The shift from 
production systems largely focused on national 
markets to those organized as sophisticated 
global production chains and networks has accel-
erated (see Chapter 16); including food chains or 
networks (Chapter 15) that vary in complexity and 
geographical coverage for different products. The 
search for new suppliers or markets as national 
opportunities become saturated adds to network 
complexity. Improved access to information via 
the Internet, cable and satellite services has also, 
metaphorically, made the world smaller.
During the first quarter of the twentieth century 
Fordist methods of production fulfilled demand for 
high-volume, low-cost, standardized products, fol-
lowed by a shift towards post-Fordist production 
systems based on greater flexibility, specialization, 
customization, strategic alliances (see Chapter 16), 
even more fragmented divisions of labour and 
expertise (Chapter 17) and horizontal rather than 
vertical integration of production. The trend was 
led first by manufacturing and then by the rise 
of service industries (see Chapter 17). Localities 
have reasserted their role as a focus for produc-
tion (Chapter 14) although an increasing discon-
nection between, for example, food producers and 
consumers also creates food security challenges 
(Chapter 15). Symbols of the Fordist era, such as 
massive production plants, have been replaced by 
industrial districts made up of networks of firms, 
small and large, that form distinctive nodes of produc-
tion such as the Third Italy or the City of London.
Yet, large firms are as influential as ever in shaping 
the geographies of production and consumption 
(see Chapters 14, 16 and 17). Transnational cor-
porations (TNCs) often command more financial 
resources than many national governments and 
exercise significant influence on economic deci-
sions, investments in infrastructure, or regulation 
by nation-states as well as international organiza-
tions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Consumption and production are mediated by 
the circulation of finance capital (Chapter 18). 
National governments, companies, or individuals 
require finance to execute investment strategies 
(companies) or purchasing decisions (house-
holds). Advances in information technology have 
greatly increased the global circulation of finance, 
and also enable innovation in the financial instru-
ments traded on stock, commodity, or currency 
exchanges in London, New York, Shanghai or 
­Singapore. Yet again, however, the flows of finance 
capital mediated by such financial centres are 
spatially uneven, to the significant disadvantage of 
marginalized nations, regions and groups.
This section demonstrates how the geography of 
the economy simultaneously incorporates global 
and local economic perspectives. They are insepa-
rable even though there have been some important 
shifts in modes of production and mechanisms of 
consumption over time and across space. Some of 
the causes and the consequences of the uneven 
economic development that results are highlighted. 
An overview of the contributions suggests that 
there are many important issues, questions and 
challenges that economic geographers can use-
fully address as the twenty-first century unfolds.

 GEOGRAPHIES OF THE ECONOMY 
 Chapter 14 

282    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
T
he economy is everywhere. It is a set of human activ-
ities and institutions linked together in the produc-
tion, distribution, exchange and consumption of goods 
and services. Wherever we happen to live, work or play 
our daily existence requires us to make decisions that 
have an economic basis. Yet, we tend to take for granted 
the ways in which society determines how the scarce 
resources at its disposal are used to provide for its 
material needs and to produce wealth. The news media 
regularly cover the economy: the balance of trade, the 
unemployment rate, consumer spending, trends in 
house prices, the relocation of jobs to other countries, 
or the prospects for the global economy. Sections on 
business and the economy in the ‘quality’ daily newspa-
pers, specialist weekly business publications, or 24-hour 
satellite television channels are exclusively devoted to 
news and information about economic affairs.
You may have noticed that ‘economies’ or ‘economy’ 
are often preceded by adjectives such as: global, local, 
market, command (or redistributive), capitalist, infor-
mal, subsistence, mixed, Internet, information, new, or 
space economy. There are clearly many different kinds of 
‘economy’ depending on the starting point for analysis; for 
example, an informal economy signifies how it is organ-
ized while a digital economy signifies something about the 
medium used to undertake economic transactions. Eco-
nomic geographers are interested in the space economy; 
the way in which the organization of geographical space 
reflects the behaviour, values, and actions of actors (indi-
viduals, firms, institutions) that comprise the economy. 
Each actor operates from or occupies some unit of space: 
a field for a crop, a room used by a self-employed person 
working from home, a building of several thousand square 
metres for a corporate call centre, a site of several hundred 
hectares used for vehicle production in Korea or Japan, 
or an area of hundreds of square kilometres occupied 
by a sheep station in the Australian outback. The house-
holds providing the labour required for producing goods 
and services also require space in which to live and are, 
in turn, a major source for consumption of the outputs 
from production that are accessed via informal and for-
mal transactions and trading. The challenge for economic 
geographers is how to analyse and explain the geographi-
cal patterns of economic activity at different scales, how 
they change over time and the relationships between them.
14.1 The changing nature of economic 
geography
The uneven distribution of economic activities is plain 
enough to see. It can be explained by the fact that differ-
ent parts of our planet are, for example, endowed with 
different resources, climates, or levels of accessibility. 
Thus the major sub-discipline of economic geography ‘is 
concerned with the spatial organization and distribution 
of economic activity, the use of the world’s resources, and 
the distribution and expansion of the world economy’ 
(Stutz and de Souza 1998: 41). While the geographi-
cal distribution of economic activities is influenced by 
historical, political, social, and environmental factors 
the outcomes arise from spatial interaction in that it 
is not possible for all the actors in the economy to be 
located at one point in geographical space. During the 
early twentieth century economic geography was termed 
‘commercial geography’: a largely factual compilation of 
the way in which different commodities were produced 
and exchanged around the world. Commercial geog-
raphy sought, for example, to analyze the factors that 
affected where particular commodities such as coal or 
iron ore were produced. Gradually the emphasis shifted 
towards explaining observed variations in the location 
patterns of commodity production and trade with the 
transformation from commercial to economic geography 
consolidated when explanations for the location of eco-
nomic activity were derived from neoclassical economics 
­(Spotlight box 14.1). This is an early example of how eco-
nomic geography has used ways of thinking and modes 
of analysis used by other disciplines, in this case econom-
ics, to inform its own agenda. Neoclassical economics is 
the study of the allocation of scarce resources amongst 
alternative ends when there are several alternative out-
comes. Interestingly, one of these is the maximization 
of social welfare that is based on the idea that the eco-
nomic basis of society determines the form of its social 
institutions. We will see later that the social basis of the 
economy is very much part of contemporary analyses of 
geographies of the economy.
In the meantime, economic geography as a sub-dis-
cipline has undergone various transformations since 
the mid twentieth century (see Scott 2004). During the 
1950s and 1960s economic geographers led the way in 
the testing of theories and ideas, using numerically-based 
quantitative methods and modelling that were seen to be 
rigorous. However, by the 1970s a different political econ-
omy approach emerged within the sub-discipline that 
made extensive use of Marxist-based interpretations of 
economic change and its socio-economic consequences 
(Harvey 1982; Swyngedouw 1982). Analysis of economic 
crises such as the global oil shortage of 1973 or the debt 
crisis of the early 1980s focused on issues of regional ine-
quality, manufacturing decline and social justice (Blue-
stone and Harrison 1982). In the 1980s the growth of 
political economic interests was also accompanied by 
empirical and theoretical analysis of some new and sur-
prising economic growth in places previously regarded 
as peripheral or outside the mainstream. In Europe, for 

Chapter 14  Geographies of the economy    283
geography within another social science discipline – 
namely, economics. The Nobel Prize winning econo-
mist Paul Krugman advocated what became known as 
‘the new economic geography’ (NEG) (Krugman 
2000; Fujita and Krugman 2004). This provoked a 
response from geographers who have argued that NEG 
is really economic geography as opposed to ‘geographi-
cal economics’ (Martin 1999a). Economists claim that, 
methodologically, NEG belongs to them but economic 
geographers claim that economists have finally acknowl-
edged the role of space (geography) and moved it from 
the edges of their discipline into the mainstream of eco-
nomic theory; away from the ‘wonderland of no dimen-
sions’ (Sheppard and Barnes 2000: 3). To avoid confusion, 
the rest of this chapter will use ‘geographical economics’ 
to refer to this strand within economics.
The second development is the impact on economic 
geography of the ‘cultural turn’ within human geogra-
phy (Barnett 1998; Cook et al. 2000c). This ‘new eco-
nomic geography’ as practised by human geographers 
increasingly recognized the importance of ‘social’ and 
‘cultural’ factors when interpreting the ‘economic world’ 
example, these included the proliferation of small-scale, 
skilled production units to form new industrial districts 
in north-east Italy, Emilia and central Italy collectively 
known as the Third Italy (Brusco 1990). Economic geog-
raphers also began to analyze the changing nature of 
manufacturing production in the world economy, par-
ticularly the rise of new flexible kinds of post-Fordist 
production systems (Amin 1994) in North America and 
Japan (Gertler 1992). This period witnessed a marked 
increase in the international division of labour, led by 
multinational corporations (Fröbel et al. 1980), which 
became but one of the trends symbolic of globalization 
and international economic interconnectedness. The way 
in which production processes, labour and transnational 
corporations were becoming increasingly caught up in 
complex global production networks (GPNs) became 
an increasingly central concern for economic geographers 
(Dicken 2015) and we will return to this theme later.
The 1990s saw two parallel developments that have 
diversified both the nature and disciplinary reach of 
economic geography. The first is the dramatic revival 
of quantitative and modelling approaches to economic 
Spotlight box 14.1
Models of economic location
There has been much interest in economic geography in 
theories or models that help to explain the development 
of economic activities within a spatial context. Neoclas-
sical economic theory was first used by Von Thünen in 
1826 (Hall 1966) to model patterns of agricultural land 
use and later applied to industrial location (Weber 1929) 
and for explaining the distribution of services and of set-
tlements (Christaller 1966). In these and numerous other 
cases the objective is to generalize about patterns of 
economic activity. However, such is the complexity of the 
real world that it is necessary to make some assump-
tions: decision makers behave in a sensible (or rational) 
fashion; they possess complete and correct knowledge 
(often referred to as perfect knowledge); everyone is 
attempting to maximize profits; competition is uncon-
strained; economic activity takes place on a uniform 
land surface. The key assumption is that distance is the 
main influence on decision-making by households and 
businesses with the resulting spatial patterns of eco-
nomic activity explained by examining the relationship 
between distance and transport costs. The outcome of 
this approach is an ideal or optimal pattern of land use 
or industrial location.
The main criticisms are the unrealistic nature of the 
assumptions and the oversight of many other factors 
that have an impact on the geography of economic 
activity such as changes in the technology of produc-
tion and consumption or the variety of ways in which 
businesses are organized.
The limitations of neoclassical models encouraged 
the development of alternatives. The behavioural model 
also attempts to arrive at generalizations but the focus 
is shifted to the role of the individual as the principal 
explanation for spatial patterns. The motives, opinions, 
preferences and perceptions of the individuals making 
location decisions are incorporated
However, behavioural models have been criticized 
for being overly descriptive. In response, a structuralist 
approach makes use of a more holistic way to explain 
the location of economic activity and how it changes. 
It is based on the premise that behaviour is shaped 
or constrained by wider processes in the social, politi-
cal and economic spheres. Notions of culture and of 
class rather than individual ideas determine the spatial 
structure of economic activity. It is not enough to explain 
patterns of economic activity; rather, it is necessary to 
examine the ‘hidden’ mechanisms or processes (e.g. 
social, political) that underpin economic patterns.

284    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
different concepts for understanding the spatial nature 
of the economy and economic activity. In the 1990s, for 
example, economic geographers developed an increasing 
interest in the (spatial) nature of relations between differ-
ent economic actors (Bathelt and Glückler 2003). Yeung 
suggests that economic geography underwent something 
of a ‘relational turn’ that is ‘concerned primarily with 
the ways in which socio-spatial relations of actors are 
intertwined with broader structures and processes of 
economic change at various geographical scales’ (Yeung 
2005: 37). Central to this shift is a realization that eco-
nomic geographers need to better understand how power 
shapes economic action. Global production networks 
(GPNs) encapsulate many of these features (see Chap-
ter 16 for a detailed discussion of their geographies). A 
second thread to the NEG has followed on from this, 
focusing broadly on the nature of economic practices and 
how their spatiality affects economies (Jones 2014). This 
sociological perspective in economic geography has also 
been concerned with the significance of power in relation, 
for example, to how transnational firms are managed or 
how knowledge practices spread innovations through 
firms and industries (Amin and Cohendet 2004). This is 
also related to a third strand of NEG that has looked 
beyond the boundaries of geography to work in eco-
nomic sociology, cultural and technology studies as a way 
to develop what has been termed a ‘cultural economy’ 
approach (Amin and Thrift 2004). Economic geographers 
in this area have ranged into new industries and areas of 
the economy that have been previously ignored – notably 
creative sectors such as fashion design, music, or com-
puter games software. The cultural economy approach 
has also brought a fresh perspective to the traditional 
concerns of the economic geographer, such as the grow-
ing body of work on financial and other kinds of mar-
kets that seeks to understand them as produced through 
the interactions between networks of social actors, their 
performances, power relations and technological devices 
(Berndt and Boeckler 2009).
(see Chapter 19 for a discussion of the links between 
culture and the consumption of goods and services). It 
is argued that lifestyles, beliefs, languages, ideas, imagi-
nations and representations interact with the economic 
to produce culturalization of the economy rather than 
the economization of culture. For example, goods and 
services incorporate cultural attributes into their design, 
marketing, packaging and potential benefits to users. 
Material possession of a good (car, camera, smartphone) 
or consumption of a service (tourism, fast food, finan-
cial transaction) is only part of the experience (a real 
as well as an imagined event) of using or being seen to 
use or to consume. Consumption of goods and services 
involves beliefs about what it says about us as individu-
als or groups: social or job status, image or wealth (see 
­Chapter 19). Economic geographers have previously rec-
ognized cultural factors when using terms such as ‘social-
ist economy’, ‘Chinese family production networks’, or 
the various ‘corporate cultures’ encountered in transna-
tional corporations (TNCs); but only recently have they 
considered the economic and the cultural to be inter-
twined rather than worthy only of separate study.
We could conclude the overview of NEG here but it 
is worth loitering a little longer to consider some further 
issues. For example, is it too simplistic to talk of ‘eco-
nomic geography’ rather than ‘economic geographies’? If 
the economy is shaped, at least in part, by social relations 
(that are by their very nature complex) and exchanges 
that reflect multiple variations in the value associated 
with the production, consumption, or circulation of a 
good or service, then ‘are the geographies constituted 
through peoples’ struggle to construct circuits of value 
sustainable across space and time’? (Lee 2006: 417) As Lee 
points out, if societies cannot do this in ways that allow 
them to make a living they can only materially repro-
duce themselves with great difficulty. In this sense, there 
is more than one economic geography.
Another important issue is the way that the NEG 
has spawned new strands of work around a range of 
Spotlight box 14.2
Perfect competition
The intensity of competition among firms encourages 
efficiency and helps to keep prices low. The ultimate 
expression of this is perfect competition. In these purely 
theoretical circumstances the actions of any one individ-
ual buyer or seller have a very limited impact on market 
prices. This is because everybody has access to all the 
information they need, all products are the same, and 
firms earn only the base minimum profit. If firms earn 
excess profits (more than the base minimum) other firms 
will enter the market. This will continue to happen until 
profits are driven down so that only normal profits are 
made.

Chapter 14  Geographies of the economy    285
A second mechanism for resolving the economic prob-
lem is a command economy in which a key objective is 
redistribution of wealth based on public ownership of the 
factors of production. Prior to its demise during the late 
1980s countries such as the former Soviet Union, Poland, 
Hungary and East Germany used central political author-
ity to prepare directives setting production targets for a 
defined period (say three or five years) for the types, and 
quantities of goods and services to be produced. In order 
to achieve the targets and to distribute the output the 
centralized direction of national economic development 
is combined with control over the allocation of human 
and physical resources. Some countries such as Cuba and 
North Korea continue to use this approach for solving 
the economic problem. Capitalist countries may use this 
mechanism during national emergencies (e.g. wartime) in 
order to mobilize resources quickly.
The market is the third approach to solving the eco-
nomic problem. In contrast to command economies, 
market economies rely on decentralized decisions by 
consumers and by firms about the quantities of goods to 
produce, the prices to charge, and how, when and where 
exchange transactions take place. Generalizations about 
the modern market system and its outcomes are actu-
ally quite difficult because decentralized decision-making 
creates complexity; for example, professional economists 
can rarely agree about the significance of the latest unem-
ployment figures, the impact of a change in bank inter-
est rates, or the likely impact of a steep rise in crude oil 
prices on the stability of the global economy.
Economies that operate by voluntary exchange in a 
free market that is not in some way managed or con-
trolled by a central authority do not in practice exist. 
Most developed nations are mixed economies in that they 
allow markets to drive most of their economic activities, 
using regulations and government intervention to ensure 
stability and efficient economic operation. Market/mixed 
economies are now in the majority, with fast emerging 
economies such as China making big strides in the same 
direction.
Within such capitalist economies most of the 
resources and the means of production are controlled by 
a relatively small proportion of individuals and firms who 
are seeking to improve their economic well being through 
competition (see Spotlight box 14.2). If we assume that 
there is more than one producer of a given good or ser-
vice, each is seeking to create the most favourable value 
(such as lower price, better quality, superior design, or 
efficient after-sales support) so as to retain or enhance 
its share of the market.
The principle of freedom of action may be para-
mount but, in practice, market economies incorporate 
regulation by national governments and/or international 
NEG is therefore also about how to theorize economies, 
economic actors and their geographies. The scope that 
this provides for a healthy, on-going debate can be illus-
trated using a set of basic propositions that are assumed 
to be true when we conceptualize a capitalist economy 
(Hudson 2004). First, there should be a variety of concepts 
of a capitalist economy that reflect the diversity of the 
flows of people or knowledge, for example, in space and 
time that make up economies. Second, the concepts used 
should not be constructed on the basis that there are sepa-
rate economies; rather, they should necessarily be treated 
as interrelated. Third, economic behaviour and practice is 
undertaken by individuals or subjects possessing knowl-
edge and skills, although not in the sense that everyone has 
complete knowledge and skills, as in perfect competition 
(see Spotlight box 14.2). Therefore, and fourth, economies 
are a social construct incorporating the full range from the 
informal habits of individuals to the formal institutions 
of the state. Fifth, individual and collective behaviour in 
a capitalist economy is influenced by, and its structures 
and institutions based on, long-term social relationships. 
Finally, capitalist economies are reproduced using vari-
ous governance institutions that exist because capitalist 
economies are formed via social relations and practices 
that are competitive and not natural.
You may recall from the beginning of this chapter that 
there are many different kinds of economy; the capitalist 
economy is but one among many and you should con-
sider whether conceptualizations such as the one above 
are likely to be the same, or different, to those applied to 
an informal, alternative, digital, or knowledge economy?
14.2 What is the economic problem?
Each of us has a variety of needs and wants that, when 
they are combined, comprise demand for goods and ser-
vices. The resources available to fulfil this demand are 
finite. The economic problem (Heilbronner 1972) is how 
to devise a system that combines the physical and human 
resources needed to produce and distribute the output of 
goods and services to attain given ends, such as the maxi-
mization of social welfare. Possible solutions are numer-
ous but they can be distilled to just three mechanisms 
(Dicken and Lloyd 1990). The first of these is tradition 
in which the allocation of resources to production relies 
on a set of ‘rules’ based on convention or past practice, 
such as the handing down of land from father to eldest 
son. Given the contemporary interest in the relationship 
between the economic and the social, it is notable that 
traditional solutions to the economic problem incorpo-
rate socially determined norms.

286    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
amongst their own establishments and between coun-
tries. There are few parts of the world that are not in 
some way affected by the activities and decisions of 
TNCs and, for some countries, it makes the difference 
between inclusion as opposed to exclusion from the eco-
nomic mainstream.
14.3 What are economies?
So far we have considered the economy in more or less 
abstract terms, although we have made reference to vari-
ous ‘actors’ such as individuals, households, companies, 
government departments, national governments, and so 
on. In order to help economic geographers to measure 
and interpret the processes and interactions that help to 
shape spatial patterns of economic activity, it is neces-
sary to simplify the complexities of real economies into 
manageable categories or groupings.
One of the most common approaches to generalizing 
the structure of economies is to divide them into four 
broad economic sectors:
1.	 Activities engaged in the exploitation of natural 
resources, such as agriculture, fishing, mining and oil 
extraction, form the primary sector. Although still 
a significant share of activity in the less developed 
economies, this sector is declining overall. Some of 
the output from the primary sector has limited use 
and value until it has been transformed in some way 
to become part of usable goods.
institutions. In the interests of equity, society needs to 
control the behaviour of those who own the means of 
production; the market is not necessarily the most effec-
tive and equitable way to allocate its rewards. Thus, most 
countries have a national organization that monitors and 
adjudicates company acquisitions and mergers in an 
attempt to avoid the development of monopolies, i.e. a 
market situation in which there is only one provider of a 
particular product or service. The absence of economic 
competition will allow a monopoly to sell a lower quan-
tity of a product at a higher price than firms in a purely 
competitive market, leading to monopolistic profits. 
Because of the increasing integration of national econ-
omies and firms (see later in this chapter), the actions 
of individual national governments are complemented 
by groupings of nation-states such as the North Ameri-
can Free Trade Area (NAFTA), Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) or international institutions such 
as the World Trade Organization (WTO) that regulate 
and facilitate trade flows of goods and services and the 
movement of labour.
One of the key targets for cross-border control and 
regulation are transnational corporations (TNCs) 
which serve markets and operate production plants or 
distribution facilities that extend well beyond their home 
countries (see Spotlight box 14.3) (see also Chapters 16 
and 17). The distribution of TNCs varies by industry 
sector and by country; most are small relative to a lim-
ited number of very large global TNCs. But they gener-
ate significant flows of capital, knowledge, information, 
expertise, products, raw materials and components 
Spotlight box 14.3
Transnational corporations (TNCs)
The definition of a TNC is that it:
● controls establishments/economic activities in at 
least one other country apart from its home country;
● possesses an ability as a result of its size or the 
ownership of particular knowledge or skills to move 
its operations and its resources quickly between 
international locations, i.e. it is relatively footloose;
● can exploit or take advantage of differences 
between countries, regions or cities around the 
globe in factor (land, labour, capital) and non-factor 
(information, knowledge, regulation) endowments;
● owns and controls overseas activities, although this 
is not a prerequisite for TNC status since there are 
many other ways, such as franchising, licensing or 
joint ventures, of achieving a presence in markets 
outside the home country;
● organizes aspects of its operation across national 
borders at the global-scale, rather than duplicating 
its activities in each national economy where it is 
present.
You may well encounter a related term: multinational 
corporation (MNC). This suggests a firm that has prem-
ises or production plants in several countries. TNC is 
therefore a much more all-embracing term than MNC; 
there are many more TNCs than there are MNCs and 
they provide the basis for a more realistic assessment 
of the scale of international investment.

the twenty-first century. The share of the tertiary and 
quaternary sectors in the total economy has expanded 
steadily for at least a hundred years and they now 
account for four out five jobs in countries such as the 
USA, Canada, Britain, Hong Kong or Australia.
Another useful way for tracking change in economic 
structures is the distinction between white-collar and 
blue-collar occupations. The former are salaried profes-
sionals (such as doctors, lawyers or airline pilots) and 
employees engaged in clerical or administrative occu-
pations performing tasks that are mentally rather than 
physically demanding. Blue-collar workers, on the other 
hand, tend to earn hourly wages for performing skilled 
or unskilled tasks in factories, construction, or technical 
installation work. An intermediate category, the pink-col-
lar worker, is also sometimes used to distinguish women 
mainly engaged in white-collar occupations that do not 
require as much professional training or who perform 
tasks to which lower prestige is attached. In line with the 
increasing share of the tertiary and quaternary sectors, 
the proportion of white-collar workers has continued to 
grow in advanced Western economies and this shift has 
become increasingly evident in emerging economies dur-
ing the twenty-first century.
14.4 A geographical approach  
to ­economic processes
One of the benefits of analyzing the structure of econo-
mies is that it enables economic geographers to meas-
ure the dynamics of change and whether, and how, it 
has impacts at different spatial scales. These dynamics 
occur at all levels of analysis: from small rural localities 
to the largest metropolitan areas, from peripheral to core 
regions, from least developed to most developed econo-
mies. This is not new or surprising but during the closing 
decades of the twentieth century it was dominated by 
changes that will shape the economic agenda well into 
the present century (such as more flexible production 
systems, see Chapter 16; or the changing nature of work, 
see Chapter 17).
As we have already noted, the share of country 
employment in the secondary sector has been declining 
steadily; by 2007 it directly supported only one in four 
jobs in the OECD countries (Table 14.1). The primary 
sector, already a very small part of the economy in devel-
oped countries, is contracting further as improved crop 
disease resistance and better fertilizers enhance farm 
productivity. Meanwhile, the tertiary and quaternary 
sectors have expanded and diversified as rising standards 
of living and disposable incomes have boosted demand 
2.	 Whether the transformation takes place near the 
source of the primary commodity or after transfer to 
a location some distance away it requires a secondary 
sector (or manufacturing). This sector is still expand-
ing in some less developed economies and the emerg-
ing economies but contracting (share of employment 
or gross domestic product, GDP) in most devel-
oped countries. The outputs from the manufacturing 
sector may be immediately suitable for final use by 
consumers, or they may be components for incorpora-
tion in other final products.
3.	 The outputs of the secondary sector require distri-
bution to the places and markets where they can be 
assembled, consumed, or purchased (Plate 14.1). The 
tertiary sector, which includes wholesale and retail 
trade, transportation, entertainment and personal 
services, fulfils this role. Improvements in transport 
and telecommunications and their integration follow-
ing major advances in computing technology since the 
early 1980s have transformed the operation and reach 
of firms in both the secondary and tertiary sector. The 
growth of international purchasing by firms and indi-
viduals via the Internet is symbolic of these changes.
4.	 A fourth, quaternary, sector has increasingly been 
identified as a separate grouping which includes 
banking, finance, business and professional services, 
the media, insurance, administration, education, 
and research and development. These intellectual 
services assemble, transmit and process the informa-
tion, knowledge and expertise used by activities in the 
other three sectors to enable them to adjust effectively 
and efficiently to the changing geographic, economic, 
social and cultural parameters of doing business in

even ten years ago (Plate 14.2). Economic globalization, 
however, cannot be separated from the social, politi-
cal and cultural context in which it is embedded which 
means it is not really ‘a unified phenomenon’, more a 
‘syndrome of processes and activities’ (Dicken 2007: 8). 
We shall return to consider this in more depth shortly.
● Informationalization denotes the increasingly central 
role of information in production and consumption in 
the world economy. The sociologist Manuel Castells 
(2009) argues that we now live in an era of a global 
informational economy, where information (or knowl-
edge) is the key input to economic activity whatever 
the industry. The rise of a whole range of new infor-
mation and communications technologies (ICT) and 
the development of the Internet are, of course, key 
enablers of this process.
● Neoliberalization is used as a shorthand term to 
describe the spread of a complex set of political and 
policy trajectories that lead to greater liberalization 
of international trade and financial markets, reduc-
tions in government spending and a greater role in the 
economy for the private sector.
● Tertiarization/quaternerization is used to describe the 
on-going development of the global service economy. 
The proportion of GDP and employment in advanced 
economies in service-sector activities continues to rise, 
for tourism, travel or private health services. The produc-
tion of goods and services also now incorporates more 
knowledge-intensive services that are heavily weighted 
towards the employment of engineers and scientists (see 
Chapter 17). These activities are growing most rapidly in 
the newly industrialized countries such as China or Bra-
zil that are ‘catching up’ with economies where services 
already provide more than 70 per cent of total employ-
ment (see Table 14.1).
There are numerous historical, political, social and 
institutional explanations for structural and functional 
changes in economies. However, from an economic 
geographers’ perspective it is useful to think about the 
geographical nature of the processes of change that are 
occurring in the contemporary global space economy. At 
least five interconnected and overlapping processes are 
worth identifying when exploring how the world econ-
omy (and within that, individual national economies) is 
evolving in the twenty-first century:
● Globalization refers (in economic terms at least) to 
the integration across national boundaries of mar-
kets, finance, technologies and nation-states in a way 
not witnessed in the past. It has enabled nation-states, 
TNCs, as well as individuals, to extend their reach 
(markets, travel) across the globe faster, further, deeper 
and at lower cost than could ever have been imagined,

and this is now also happening in less developed econ-
omies (see Chapter 17).
● Financialization refers to the growing importance 
and centrality of financial capital in all geographical 
regions and industry sectors in the global economy; it 
is also used to describe the growing power of finance 
and financial logics (see Chapter 18).
These processes impact and affect different parts of 
the world economy in different ways, and with different 
consequences. They form, however, the basis for develop-
ing an understanding of why economic development is 
uneven at the global scale, and how it is likely to evolve. 
We now turn to consider in more depth how these pro-
cesses have led to the emergence of an increasingly glo-
balized world economy that requires analysis as an entity 
rather than as a collection of many smaller economies 
restricted to nation-states or regions.
14.5 The rise of a global economy
Earlier conceptions of globalization suggested a con-
vergence of economic, social and cultural values across 
the localities, regions and nations that come together as 
the ‘global economy’. However, as Dicken (2015) argues, 
whilst ‘there are undoubtedly globalizing forces at work, 
we do not have a fully globalized world economy’. Glo-
balization is ‘reflected in’ and ‘influenced by multiple 
geographies, rather than a single global geography’ 
(Dicken 2015: 7). As all the other chapters in this section 
of the book show, we should beware of regarding globali-
zation as producing convergence or uniformity. Rather, 
‘globalization’ is convenient shorthand for capturing 
ideas about an integrating global economy, but it should 
not divert us from the reality that there are persistent vari-
ations in the levels of participation of different parts of 
the world (Figure 14.1).
Globalization may be far from smoothing economic 
inequalities but if we assume for the moment that ‘every 
country may not feel part of the global[ization] system, 
but every country is being globalized and shaped by it’ 
(see Friedman 1999, 2005), then what are the symptoms? 
The first is the pivotal role of knowledge. The informa-
tionalization of economies (Castells 2009) means that 
production processes themselves are dependent on knowl-
edge as the key input that creates value. For manufactured 
goods, for example, it is the design, marketing and cus-
tomer support experience that makes products successful 
and makes firms’ profits. And because the creation and 
exchange of knowledge tends to be embodied in people 
(see also Chapter 17) rather than machines, national 
economic health relies more than ever on ‘producing’ an 
educated and skilled workforce.
Second, technology has become transnationalized, 
especially amongst knowledge-intensive economic 
activities such as financial services or information and 
communications technologies (ICT). This does not nec-
essarily mean better access to the factors of production; 
the increased complexity of the opportunities created by 
advanced technology means that only those individuals, 
companies and institutions with the resources to manage 
high technology can really take advantage.
Third, there has been a marked increase in the power 
and influence of finance through a range of financializa-
tion processes. Finance capital now takes many forms and 
moves almost seamlessly and with great speed, especially 
between the world’s stock, currency, commodity and 
futures exchanges located in ‘global cities’ such as Tokyo, 
New York, London and Hong Kong (see Chapter 18). 

290    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
many of the original mortgage borrowers were unable 
to repay the loans. This triggered a financial crisis with 
many banks suddenly being exposed to huge losses, or 
even going bankrupt in the case of Lehman Brothers and 
Bear Stearns in the USA. In Europe, governments had to 
intervene to prevent even large banks like Halifax Bank 
of Scotland (HBOS) and former building societies like 
Northern Rock from going bust. The ‘contagion’ that 
this financial crisis triggered, and the subsequent eco-
nomic recession, penetrated every corner of the world 
economy and demonstrates how finance has bound the 
world economy ever more closely together.
A fourth symptom of globalization is the emergence 
of global oligopolies, that is, markets dominated by a 
small number of suppliers of a product or service (Case 
study 14.1). For a market sector in which there are very 
few buyers the term oligopsony has been coined. This is 
the converse of an oligopoly; for example, just six com-
panies in the USA own the majority of movie theatres so 
that a film distribution company has very few negotiating 
alternatives. A similar story exists in many industries; the 
majority of drugs are increasingly made by a diminish-
ing number of very large pharmaceutical companies like 
GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, and in the airline industry, 
mergers continue apace with even large airlines like Brit-
ish Airways, American Airlines and Iberia seeking to 
merge. There is now a sense in which corporate and eco-
nomic survival requires ‘going global’. The fifth symptom 
of globalization is that the power of individual nations to 
regulate their own economic development or to exercise 
a strong influence on the outcome, for example, of trade 
Electronic trading has ensured volatile and fast-changing 
financial markets that can transform the economic pros-
pects of companies and, more importantly, of national or 
regional economies very quickly indeed. Equally, over the 
last couple of decades many new kinds of financial capi-
tal and financial firms have appeared replacing older and 
more traditional forms of finance for economic activity. 
This has not always been regarded as a positive develop-
ment, however, with financialization processes seen by 
many within and beyond economic geography as creat-
ing greater instability and risk in an increasingly interde-
pendent global economy (c.f. Harvey 2009).
The most recent example of this is, of course, the 
global financial crisis and economic downturn that 
began in 2007 and has led to an on-going period of low 
growth and global economic uncertainty. The recent 
recession was the deepest economic downturn in the 
world economy since the Second World War, and was 
transmitted initially through increasingly globalized 
financial markets. It began in the United States where 
banks and other financial firms got into trouble after 
developing new forms of finance around the housing 
industry. The financial industry sold on household mort-
gages as new kinds of financial ‘debt’ products (known 
as mortgage-backed securities) that were sold on in 
global financial markets. Banks across the globe bought 
these new products, and banks in other countries (the 
UK, for example) also sold their mortgage debt on in a 
similar fashion. This had had the effect of making mort-
gages cheap in countries like the USA and the UK, but 
when their economies began to slow, it became clear that

of employment and migration. In order to understand 
better the uneven consequences of the emergence of an 
increasingly globalized world economy, we consider, in 
this section, two aspects to this unevenness: trade and 
foreign direct investment.
14.6.1 Uneven trade
Trade in the world economy refers simply to the buying 
and selling of goods and services between actors in dif-
ferent localities. As the world economy has globalized, 
total trade has grown enormously but trade benefits 
some localities and not others depending on the nature 
of their economies. Whilst growth in total world trade 
stalled during the 2007–9 economic downturn, the long-
term trend has been one of expansion. In 2013, world 
trade measured in terms of goods exports amounted to 
US$18.3 trillion, while exports of commercial services 
were worth US$4.7 trillion (WTO 2014b). Much of this 
trade at the level of nations is concentrated between the 
wealthier countries in the global economy, although in 
the last decade developing countries like China and India 
have experienced huge trade growth, with China’s trade 
surplus becoming an increasing source of tension in 
international politics (see Section 14.9).
Globalization processes have made understanding the 
idea of trade increasingly difficult, however. Conven-
tionally, trade was measured at the national level with 
agreements has been diluted by the rise of transnational 
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) or the World Trade Organization (WTO) that 
coordinate, steer and even regulate aspects of the world 
economy. Nation-states have also increasingly organized 
themselves into regional trading blocs to facilitate easier 
and greater volumes of trade. The European Union 
(EU) is one, but such regional economic arrangements 
have grown in importance in the last 20 years elsewhere. 
Examples include the North American Free Trade Agree-
ment Area (NAFTA) and the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
14.6 Global uneven development:  
the examples of trade and 
foreign direct investment
In light of the many processes of integration and inter-
connectedness in the world economy, it thus makes sense 
to talk of a ‘global economy’. However, it is also impor-
tant to realize that economic globalization has been and 
continues to be highly uneven. It produces a range of 
global economic geographies whether you are consider-
ing the complex spatial form of the global city networks 
that are key in controlling global economic operations, or 
new kinds of global labour markets that shape patterns 
Case study 14.1 
An oligopoly: Nestlé
Nestlé is a Swiss-based company founded in 1866 
that is now the top-ranking food and beverage pro-
ducer in the world with sales of over US$100 billion 
in 2007. It employs 265,000 and has factories and 
operations in almost every country in the world.  
Nestlé has achieved this position by acquiring other 
related companies and brands; in 2001 it purchased 
Ralston Purina, making it the leading pet food manu-
facturer in the world; it purchased the leading French 
bottled water producer (Perrier) in the late 1990s to 
become number one for that product, the UK choco-
late maker Joseph Rowntree in 1998 (Kit Kat) and 
Novartis Pharmaceutical in 2007 (Ovaltine). It now 
owns eight further French waters including Vittel, as 
well as regional brands like Buxton in the UK, that 
are sold in 37 different countries in 2010. Nestlé is 
the leading producer of instant coffee (Nescafé was 
the first instant coffee on the market), and a major 
manufacturer of sweets and chocolates, and has 
increased its dominance of the ice-cream sector by 
merging the Nestlé Ice Cream Company with the 
leading US company (Dreyers) in 2003. In addition to 
food products, Nestlé is involved in cosmetics (it has 
a large stake in L'Oréal), nutritional supplements and 
eye care. Its long-term strategy is to continue expand-
ing worldwide, especially into emerging markets such 
as China, India, Latin America and Russia where, for 
example, in 2007 it invested US$120 million in a new 
coffee-processing plant.
Other oligopolies include Coca-Cola, Pepsico, 
Pearson, Interbrew and Gillette. For these leading 
oligopolies the key objective is to protect or to acquire 
world-class brands. There are currently some 40 con-
sumer brands worldwide with sales in excess of one 
billion dollars annually (Coke, for example, sells over 
US$15 billion). The companies with these exceptional 
products are growing and expanding internationally at 
more than 10 per cent per annum.

292    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
Organization (UNWTO) divided country arrivals in 
2013 into leisure, recreation holidays (568 million), busi-
ness travel (152 million), and visiting friends and rela-
tives, religious purposes, health treatment and so on 
(367 million). Apart from demand for land, air and sea 
transport services, such large-scale flows also represent 
tourism receipts at a large number of destinations. 
Whether travelling on business or for leisure, visitors 
spend on accommodation, food and drink, local trans-
port, shopping, entertainment and so on. In many cases 
this trade in tourism creates much-needed employment 
and other economic development opportunities, often 
in those less developed regions that have been largely 
bypassed by some of the other symbols of participation 
in the global space of flows (Table 14.2). Tourist desti-
nations such as the Caribbean islands, Thailand, Bali, 
the Maldives or Fiji are benefiting from comparative 
advantage (Spotlight box 14.5) as well as the concept 
of competitive advantage, which is the advantage that 
a country or a business has over its competitors because 
of the quality or superiority of its products or services 
which will persuade other countries or customers to buy 
from it rather than from competitors (Porter 1990). The 
latter is a more useful way of explaining how individual 
nations participate in the international tourist market in 
that it incorporates differences in values, cultures, histo-
ries and institutions as well as variations in endowments 
of the factors of production that make some tourist des-
tinations more appealing than others.
nation-states counting how many goods and services they 
exported and imported. However, globalization processes 
have complicated this in a number of ways. For one thing, 
a growing proportion of world trade is different parts of 
the same large transnational firm ‘trading’ with another 
part – this undermines the historical assumption that 
trade ended in the consumption of a product or service. 
Another issue is the nature of what is traded, with not 
only services but also new digitized products (e.g. soft-
ware, music, film) hard to measure because they are sold 
and bought in different parts of the global economy.
The uneven impacts of international trade in certain 
markets have over several decades led to the emergence of 
a growing civil society movement to promote ‘fair trade’ 
amongst, in particular, the rich countries of the global 
North and developing countries of the global South. The 
argument is that the power of oligopolies in the global 
economy has forced down prices for basic commodities 
such as tea, coffee, sugar, cocoa and cotton that are often 
produced in poorer countries with the result that the pro-
ducers (often small farmers) are penalized by low prices. 
Fair trade initiatives and campaigns for ‘trade justice’ 
thus seek to create a range of market-based mechanism to 
deliver better terms of trade to producers in low-income 
countries (see Spotlight box 14.4) (see also Chapter 16).
We can illustrate the growth and development of 
world trade in the contemporary global economy 
with the example of the worlds’ largest industry – 
namely, tourism. The United Nations World Tourism

Fair trade?
The idea of fair trade has its root in the 1940s and 
1950s, but it was in the 1960s that a number of non-
governmental organizations based in developed coun-
tries began to argue that the rise of large multinational 
firms and free market capitalism was not necessarily 
beneficial for the poorest people in the world, most of 
whom lived in the global South and worked in agricul-
ture. MNCs (now TNCs), along with the tendency for 
oligopolies to form in many industries, meant that small 
farmers and commodity producers in poor countries 
received a very low price for their goods. The fair trade 
movement thus developed with the goal of rebalancing 
these trading relations and giving poor producers in 
developing countries a fair price for their products and 
produce. The fair trade movement started with fairly 
priced ‘handicraft goods’ in the 1960s, but by the 1980s 
the emphasis had shifted to commodities like coffee, 
cocoa, sugar and cotton.
In 1998, four organizations (Fair Trade Labelling 
International, the International World Fair Trade Asso-
ciation, the Network of European Workshops and the 
European Fair Trade Association) that had all been set 
up to achieve a more equitable trading system for pro-
ducers in developing countries formed an organization 
called ‘FINE’ with the aim of together promoting fair 
trade in a coherent way. FINE produced a common defi-
nition of fair trade as ‘a trading partnership, based on 
dialogue, transparency and respect, that seeks greater 
equity in international trade’ and also which contributes 
‘to sustainable development’.
Fair trade products have now achieved more market 
penetration in richer countries than at any point previously 
with, for example, major supermarket chains like Tesco and 
coffee retailers like Starbucks selling fair trade products.

Chapter 14  Geographies of the economy    293
shocks such as the global economic crisis between 2007 
and 2010; outflows from the developed economies 
exceeded US$1.1 trillion a year prior to 2007 but had 
fallen back by 2010. An earlier slowdown of the world 
economy in 2000–1 caused a decline in corporate cross-
border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) which make up 
a large part of FDI activity, but by 2006 M&A activity 
once again reached a record high with deals worth US$4 
billion before a significant decline again in the 2008–10 
period (OECD 2009). FDI between developed countries 
is more important than FDI into developing countries. 
However, some of the biggest inflows in recent years, 
although still a relatively small proportion of the total, 
have been recorded by the newly emerging economies of 
Central and Eastern Europe and by the BRICS (Brazil, 
Russia, India, China and South Africa).
14.6.2 Foreign direct investment
Another indicator of the integration of the global econ-
omy is foreign direct investment (FDI). In the context 
of our example of tourism, the development of many 
international tourist destinations relies on FDI, which is 
defined as the acquisition by an individual or enterprise 
resident in one country of assets (such as hotels, restau-
rants and clubs) located in another. World FDI inflows 
and outflows for developed and developing economies 
fluctuate from year to year in line with the performance 
of world, regional or individual national economies 
(Table 14.3). Overall, flows have been increasing in real 
terms since 1990, with the developed economies generat-
ing outflows of FDI in excess of US$935 billion in 2010, 
or just over 75 per cent of the world total. FDI fluctuates 
year on year and is particularly vulnerable to economic

Comparative advantage
Comparative advantage explains the tendency for coun-
tries (or regions/localities within countries) to specialize 
in certain goods and/or services even if they have the 
ability to fulfil their needs from domestic production. As 
long as countries or regions specialize in those prod-
ucts and/or services in which they have comparative 
advantage, they will gain from trade. Advantages can 
stem from spatial variations in, for example, mineral or 
land resource endowments, from variations in the edu-
cational levels of the labour force, in access to markets, 
or differences in levels of technology. For comparative 
advantage to work effectively it is necessary to assume 
a system of free trade, hence the significance of the 
trade liberalization that has been high on the agenda 
of many countries since the 1980s. There is a nagging 
concern, however, that comparative advantage is not 
reflected in actual patterns of world trade. We would 
expect the biggest flows to be between the countries 
with the largest cost differences. It seems that con-
sumer tastes and geographical proximity are actually 
more important than cost differences. This explains the 
fact that the vast majority of trade is between countries 
with relatively small cost differences, often involves simi-
lar rather than different goods (such as cars, electrical 
goods of all kinds, certain kinds of business services 
such as management consulting),and occurs on a ‘near-
est neighbour’ basis. Well over half of EU goods and 
services trade takes place between the member states 
while Canada and Mexico are the major trading partners 
of the USA.

294    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
To summarize, the globalization of economies has 
strengthened the role of market forces while, as a result 
of advances in telecommunications and transporta-
tion technology, it has eased some of the constraints 
on interaction imposed by space and time. With the 
real cost of international telecommunications declining 
steadily over the past 25 years, global financial integra-
tion has strengthened and has been accompanied by 
diversified opportunities for new kinds of international 
trade, especially in services, and enabled easier transfer 
of the technology and innovation that encourages eco-
nomic development and participation. The importance 
of non-government organizations, TNCs, and regional 
trading blocs such as the European Union, ASEAN and 
NAFTA for shaping the economic geography of globali-
zation has also been greatly enhanced and will continue 
to increase.
14.7 Places and localities in an 
uneven global economy
While the geography of economies accommodates a 
global dimension, this is not at the expense of individ-
ual localities. Indeed ‘it is the combination of national 
and intensely local conditions that fosters competitive 
advantage’ (Porter 1990: 158). Localities are subdivisions 
within nations, such as cities or regions or places that 
often have a particular economic identity because of the 
kinds of activities that take place there. Rural districts 
TNCs contribute significantly to FDI activity. 
Although the number and size of developing coun-
try TNCs is now increasing, most FDI inflows result  
from the activities of developed country TNCs and over 
60 per cent of their investments are made in other devel-
oped economies. Outflows from developing and transi-
tion economies (particularly BRICS) are now increasing 
as TNCs from these countries evolve into major regional 
and even global players. For those countries able to 
attract it, FDI helps to secure access to capital, tech-
nologies and organizational expertise. The net effect is 
modernization of infrastructure, an increase in industrial 
capability and an improvement in the quality and breadth 
of much-needed financial, business and professional ser-
vices. China, a vast potential market comprising more 
than one-fifth of the world’s population, was closed to 
FDI until the mid-1980s but is now one of the leading 
recipients. Prior to an economic downturn during the late 
1990s, almost two-thirds of the FDI flows to developing 
countries went to Asia (excluding Japan). These flows 
to Asia have subsequently recovered, but whilst there 
has been some increase in the last decade, much of the 
African continent continues to be bypassed for any form 
of FDI, even though many of its countries are resource-
rich. With the exception of South Africa and a few West 
African countries such as Nigeria which have seen some 
growth (UNCTAD 2009), consumer-purchasing power is 
low and average incomes per capita are at best growing 
slowly and not in a way that will raise the consumption of 
major consumer goods to a level that justifies the invest-
ment attention of most TNCs.

lowing components: equity capital, reinvested earnings and intra-company loans.

foreign exchange trading was undertaken in London; it 
was the second largest global centre for legal services, and 
in 2009 it handled 45 per cent of the total global market 
turnover in company equities (shares) that took place in 
exchanges other than the companies’ domestic (or home 
market) exchanges.
These are just a few of the indicators of the unique 
localization of highly dynamic entrepreneurial, innovative 
and international economic activities in one very small 
space. There is clearly something about the environment 
in such localities that facilitates their competitiveness. For 
the City of London local factors such as high quality pro-
fessional and support services, a skilled and diversified 
labour force, a focus on leading soft and hard infrastruc-
ture, and a consistent, politically neutral legal system that 
is widely used and understood globally help to place the 
City ahead of its global competitors (Tokyo, New York, 
Frankfurt) (TheCityUK 2014) (see also Table 14.4). It is not 
just about economic advantages; quality of life, cosmopoli-
tan cultures, linguistic diversity, and a fair and just busi-
ness environment are some of the social/cultural factors 
that also help us to understand how such localities work. 
On the basis of its prominent international status, firms 
operating from the City of London are able to attract the 
most skilled foreign workers who meet its needs both for 
highly educated staff offering very specialized knowledge 
as well as for more routine occupations in hotels and cater-
ing, transport services, or office servicing.
It has been argued that increased localization and 
agglomeration effects are thus a crucial converse out-
come of wider globalization. Whilst London (and 
not just the City of London) is a leading example, 
research on global cities more widely suggests that to 
some extent all of them are experiencing similar trends 
and that economic success in localities is increasingly 
affected by the complex mixture of place-based fac-
tors. National governments have responded to these 
ideas with policies aimed at giving localities greater 
autonomy over the institutions and instruments that 
they put in place, using the insights gained from 
detailed knowledge of local networks, to capitalize on 
their economic advantages or to create economic and 
social environments that will attract new investment. 
One very influential idea is that the economic success 
of cities and other localities is increasingly depend-
ent on skilled knowledge workers who undertake (in 
a broad way) the creative aspects of economic activ-
ity in the global information economy (Florida 2002). 
Attracting this new ‘creative class’ has been argued to 
be a crucial component of any policies introduced by 
local government or other institutions that are seeking 
to develop strategies for strengthening regional eco-
nomic development (see Spotlight box 14.6).
or subdivisions that specialize in the production of very 
particular kinds of wine (Bordeaux region, France), dairy 
products (Jutland region, Denmark) or woollen goods 
(Wales), for example, are also included. Many are identi-
fied as named territorial units while others are industrial 
districts or agglomerations whose identities are derived 
from specific economic activities, such as Motorsport 
Valley (Pinch and Henry 1999) in southern England, Sili-
con Valley in California or the light industrial districts of 
the Third Italy. Although these are often highly special-
ized and self-contained localities with systems of govern-
ance and regulation that fit their particular needs, they 
are inextricably linked with the wider national and global 
economic system.
These local economies and ‘industrial clusters’ thrive on 
the dynamism, innovation and ‘untraded interdependen-
cies’ (knowledge and information that circulates through 
the transfer of key workers between firms or via social and 
other networks) that are made possible by proximity. Even 
TNCs, that are now often portrayed as being ‘placeless’ 
because their operations are so extensive and relatively 
mobile, started from businesses that were nurtured in a 
particular locality with its own economic and other charac-
teristics to such an extent that the locally shaped attributes 
of such firms are carried through into their organization 
and transformation into TNCs (Dicken 2015). Economic 
geographers have, for example, sought to understand how 
the proximity of firms in clusters produces ‘regional inno-
vation systems’ where the concentration of firms or sectors 
into one locality is argued to be instrumental in produc-
ing competitive success through innovation in the global 
economy (Asheim et al. 2007).
An outstanding example of the synergy between local 
and global processes is the City of London. This one-
square-mile (259 hectares) district and the areas that 
fringe it in central London provided employment for 
392,000 workers in 2013 (Department of the Built Envi-
ronment 2014). The special characteristic of the City in 
particular is that the majority of its business activities are 
knowledge-intensive services. These include commercial 
banks and insurance companies, international banks, 
sophisticated private and corporate banking, firms oper-
ating in the foreign exchange, securities, commodities, 
shipping and derivatives markets, fund management, 
corporate finance, professional advisory services (legal, 
accountancy) that are associated with the City’s finan-
cial-services complex, as well as advertising firms and 
other highly specialized activities. Furthermore, a large 
proportion of these activities are owned or managed by 
non-UK enterprises to such an extent that it is sometimes 
said that the City has stronger links with Europe and the 
rest of the world than it has with the rest of the United 
Kingdom. In 2013 more than 41 per cent of all global

The importance of a ‘new creative class’ 
in today’s global economy
The American social scientist, Richard Florida, suggested 
the idea of a new creative class in his book The Rise 
of  the Creative Class published in 2002. Florida’s initial 
concern is the role in the US economy of what he identi-
fies as a new class of creative workers that comprises 
some 40 million people (about a third of the workforce). 
Using the standard occupational classification, Florida 
divides this creative class into three groups, the two major 
ones are the ‘super-creative core’, which covers a wide 
range of occupations (science, engineering, education, 
computer programmers, research, arts, design) that cre-
ates products and consumer goods, and the ‘creative 
professionals’, who are essentially more conventional 
knowledge-based workers in finance, legal services, 
healthcare and education. A third, much smaller, group 
comprises the bohemians, including artists, writers and 
dramatists. The key argument Florida makes is that it is 
these segments of the workforce that are the major driv-
ers of growth in today’s global economy, and American 
(and hence other) cities and regions need to focus on 
attracting and supporting these groups.
The concept of the creative class has had enormous 
influence amongst policy practitioners beyond the USA 
since it was proposed, but it is not uncontroversial. Eco-
nomic geographers (amongst others) have been critical 
of the idea in a range of ways, including the view that 
the concept has no causal mechanism (it is more about 
description than about any process) (Peck 2005) or 
that empirical research has found little sense of identity 
amongst those people supposedly in these groups, with 
membership being based more on educational achieve-
ment than any measure of creativity (Markusen 2006). 
However, workers that could be classified in this way are 
an increasing feature worldwide, including in emerging 
economies across Asia and South America in particular.
14.8 The rise of a new global  
digital economy?
In many respects the interaction between localities and 
the global economy is shaped by the so-called digital 
economy. It is estimated that there were three billion 
Internet users worldwide (almost 43 per cent of the total 
population) at the end of 2014 (ITU 2014), up from two 
billion in 2010 (Table 14.5). E-commerce was already 
expanding at the end of the 1990s but it is now grow-
ing and diversifying even more rapidly, led by business-
to-business (B2B) and business-to-customer (B2C) 
transactions by service sector activities such as telecom-
munications, information technology, publishing and 
the media, travel and tourism, retailing, transportation 

Chapter 14  Geographies of the economy    297
eliminate the effects of friction of distance on economic 
interactions. But this will require a truly global network 
of telecommunications and computer infrastructure that 
is accessible to all, and increasingly it seems likely that the 
unevenness persistent in the material economy will be a 
feature of the digital one too. As the data in Table 14.5 
show, some national economies are yet to be ‘plugged in’ 
to the Internet. To be excluded is to widen the gap that 
already exists between those countries ‘inside’ and those 
‘outside’ the global digital economy. A networked readi-
ness index (Figure 14.2) reveals wide differences in the 
geographical distribution (number, density and process-
ing power, for example) of the computers, telecommuni-
cations networks and software required to participate in 
the global economy. However, Africa’s digital economy 
deficit may be rectified much more rapidly than expected 
with the expansion of cellular (mobile) telephony. Cell 
phones not only offer voice services but also technolo-
gies that bypass the need for a computer to access the 
World Wide Web so that as early as 2001 Africa was the 
first world region where the number of mobile subscrib-
ers exceeded the number of fixed-line subscribers. Access 
to mobile phones opens up all kinds of economic and 
social benefits such as better access to information about 
crop prices, guidance and support from government insti-
tutions on how to run small businesses, accessing bank 
services without the need to travel (including money 
transfers), or keeping in touch with family and friends.
A second challenge posed by the digital economy is 
the demand for human resources. More jobs will be cre-
ated by the digital economy than will be lost but they are 
generally in higher-skilled and better-paid occupations. 
In order to fill new digital-economy jobs, economies 
and professional services like management consultancy, 
industrial design and engineering. Although consumer 
sales attract the publicity (such as the phenomenal 
growth of eBay or Amazon), much of the expansion of 
e-commerce is between and within businesses. Global 
B2C sales topped US$1 trillion for the first time in 2012 
with the USA alone accounting for US$365 billion but 
are dwarfed by B2B transactions estimated at US$.7 tril-
lion by 2020, led by Chinese firm Alibaba accounting for 
twice the combined ecommerce transactions of Amazon 
and eBay. The potential for growth in direct cross-border 
sales to consumers is substantial as Internet access (see 
Table 14.5), user confidence, payment systems, Inter-
net/Web security, and mechanisms for tracking transac-
tions for levying taxes and duties, continue to improve. 
Furthermore, the development of new so-called ‘Web 
2.0’ technologies have again transformed the nature of 
Internet usage itself, with the rise of ‘real-time’ streamed 
data and increased storage capacity online. Social net-
working businesses such as Facebook offer new but still 
underdeveloped e-commerce opportunities, and the rapid 
proliferation of mobile web devices (Apple’s iPhone, for 
example) means that online commerce is a rapidly chang-
ing sector both in terms of hardware and software (see 
Case study 14.2).
Apart from the numerous legal, regulatory, security 
and other challenges it presents, the global digital econ-
omy is likely to be accompanied by new geographies of 
the economy. Just as the Industrial Revolution generated 
significant economic and social changes (both positive 
and negative) in the form of new jobs, new industries and 
new industrial regions, so will the digital economy stimu-
late its own revolution. Perhaps the Internet will finally

Facebook versus Google?
One of the most dramatic developments in the global 
economy since the turn of the century is the contin-
ued rise of new media and web industries. During the 
late 1990s, the so-called ‘tech boom’ led to the rapid 
rise (and equally rapid demise) of many new firms in 
web-based software whose success was built on the 
emergence of e-commerce and new software for the 
World Wide Web that had increasing technical capac-
ity. However, since the turn of the century, this new era 
of ‘Web 2.0’ has produced another phase comprising 
a mixture of new and existing firms enjoying meteoric 
success. No companies exemplify this more than 
­California-based rivals Facebook and Google.
Founded in 1998 by two Stanford PhD students, 
Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google is a software 
company that has become the dominant web search 
engine. Now based in California’s Silicon Valley, and at 
more than a decade old in today’s digital economy, it is a 
long-standing player. Google has developed its business 
beyond web-search into online advertising, and perhaps 
most importantly a range of software products that 
include the Android operating system for third-generation 
cellphones. In this latter area it competes with Apple, but 
it is in the lucrative area of online web advertising where 
Google makes most of its money, it also competes with 
a relative newcomer, Facebook. Famously founded 
by Mark Zuckerburg in his Harvard dormitory in 2004, 
Facebook has grown spectacularly and had overtaken 
Google in terms of visitors to its website by mid-2010. 
Facebook’s product is of course its social networking 
software that is based on Web 2.0 technology, giving 
users a personal profile they manage themselves. In 
May 2012, Facebook listed on the stock exchange at a 
value of US$104 billion, still the largest recorded value 
of any public listed company. By June 2014 it had 1.3 bil-
lion active users worldwide.
The very rapid growth of companies like Google and 
Facebook reflects the global penetration of the Internet 
in the contemporary global economy, and the potentially 
vast commercial revenues that new forms of web adver-
tising and product sales may generate. The ongoing 
challenge for both companies is how to generate com-
mercially viable business models in a digital world where 
technology moves at break-neck speed, and new com-
petitors seek to break-in with new innovations almost 
continuously.

this has become much more pronounced. China’s rate 
of economic growth since 1995 has rarely fallen below 
5 per cent per annum. Despite the economic crisis during 
the late 1990s other Asian economies have also enjoyed 
sustained growth during the first 15 years, surpassing 
the growth rates of the traditional developed countries 
in Europe and North America. Equally important to the 
‘re-balancing’ of the global economy towards the East, is 
the geographically uneven impact of the global economic 
downturn of 2007–10. Whilst the formerly wealthiest 
industrialized economies of the G7 (USA, UK, Canada, 
France, Germany, Japan and Italy) in the global North 
suffered declines in GDP of up to 9 per cent from their 
2006/7 peaks, economies in Asia suffered far less with a 
much more short-lived recession (and in some cases con-
tinued positive growth).
The result is a dramatic transformation that by 2010 had 
reached a critical turning point whereby the G7 no longer 
account for the lion’s share of global GDP. In the period 
between 2000 and 2010, the share of global GDP accounted 
for by the G7 countries declined from 72 per cent to  
53 per cent (IMF estimate for 2011). In 2013, the economy 
of countries like the UK struggled to breach 0.5 per cent. 
Compare this to the Chinese government’s attempts to 
manage a much higher growth rate of 7.7 per cent in 2013 
that continues a trend that makes it the globe’s second-
largest economy after the USA. China’s economic power 
has thus not only increased over the last decade, but has 
even eclipsed almost all the formerly ‘rich’ countries of 
the G7. Whilst, because of its enormous population, 
GDP per capita still places it as an upper middle-income 
everywhere need to retrain existing workforces and to 
train future workers. History suggests that the response 
to this challenge will be uneven; comparative advan-
tage will enable some economies and some localities to 
respond more quickly and effectively than others. Per-
haps less certain is how this will modify existing spatial 
patterns of economic development. A digital economy, 
for example, enables a wide range of purchasing and 
banking transactions to be undertaken from home via 
the telephone, laptop computers, televisions, or on the 
move using mobile phones that provide access to Internet 
services. An international door-to-door delivery time of 
24 hours or much less is now commonplace, depending 
on the type of good or service, whether it is required just 
in time, or the location of the supplier. Moreover, cross-
border transactions and payments are as easy as those 
made to the local supermarket or bookstore. With shop-
ping sites on the Internet presenting themselves as ‘vir-
tual malls’ and encouraging users to place their selections 
in ‘baskets’ or ‘carts’, they are attempting to replicate 
offline retail outlets. More than 75 per cent of Internet 
users shopped online for books, travel, banking and a 
wide range of goods in the USA and 85 per cent in Aus-
tralia and New Zealand in 2013. This, combined with 
trends such as increased working from home or telework-
ing, whether self-employed or as an employee of a TNC, 
points to the potential for significant changes.
The challenge for economic geographers is how 
to understand the ways in which the digital economy 
impacts on the structure and pattern of economic activi-
ties at different scales, on the structure of localities and 
their relationship with the global economy, or on the rela-
tive importance of nations and TNCs in regulating or 
influencing the outcome.
14.9 Global re-balancing:  
the eastward shift
We end our overview of the geographies of economy 
with a consideration of probably the most pressing 
question that economic geographers can address in the 
first half of the twenty-first century: the re-balancing 
of the geography of the global economy away from the 
historical pattern of economic activity that has long 
been dominated by North America and Europe. In 
short, the key issue is the progressive ‘shift eastwards’ 
in terms of the centre of gravity for growth and output 
in the global economy.
Whilst there has been a longstanding trend since the 
1980s for significant growth in the formerly ‘less devel-
oped’ economies of Asia, since the turn of the century

rather than a high-income country, China is no longer 
accurately described as a developing economy; many 
parts of its coastal regions are highly developed even if 
large areas of its inland provinces remain poor and agri-
cultural. To a lesser extent, as there remains considerable 
poverty in many areas, a similar transformation has also 
been occurring in India around the key metropolitan cen-
tres of Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. With annual GDP 
growth ranging between 3.5–7 per cent between 2004 and 
2014, India’s rapid economic growth has also led to the 
emergence of a new middle class (some 24 per cent of the 
population in 2010) with rising incomes and increasingly 
employed in the tertiary sector.
Furthermore, annual growth rates across the globe 
seem set to continue this re-balancing beyond just Asia. 
Increasingly economic geographers have become inter-
ested in other growth nodes in the former south. A new 
focus has been the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, 
China, South Africa) economies, but transformations are 
also evident in other parts of the global South – in Tanza-
nia (east Africa), or in small but increasingly prosperous 
Costa Rica and Panama in Central America. While it may 
not be pertinent at present to refer to an eastward shift in 
terms of GDP, there are signs that the general rebalancing 
away from the global North comprises a complex pattern 
of haves and have-nots.
The implications of this shift in economic power for 
understanding the economic geography of the global 
economy are enormous. It seems likely that Asian econ-
omies will continue to grow more strongly than many 
economies of the global North over the next decade, and 
political unrest notwithstanding in central Asia and Rus-
sia, the trajectory of the BRICS economies appears one 
of continued significant growth in the coming decades. 
Moreover, historic divisions between the nature of the 
economies in the global north and south are also eroding 
as tertiary and quaternary industries take hold to at least 
some extent in many economies of the global South. The 
questions that face economic geographers are no longer 
therefore so much about the impact of developing econo-
mies that become more developed, but rather about the 
effects of a fundamental further geographical shift in the 
centre of gravity of the global economy away from the 
advanced industrial economies of the West.

 GEOGRAPHIES OF FOOD 
PRODUCTION 
 Chapter 15 

Chapter 15  Geographies of food production    303
15.1 Thinking about food
This chapter introduces some debates about the chang-
ing nature of food provision and presents ideas and case 
studies to prompt critical reflection. Food has become a 
topic of great interest to human geographers in the last 
decade or so (see, for example, Cook et al. 2006, 2008, 
2011; Morgan et al. 2006; Maye et al. 2007; Goodman et 
al. 2010; Sage 2012; Maye and Kirwan 2013; Hopma and 
Woods 2014; Friedberg 2014) and the chapter begins by 
identifying its value as a tool for geographical analysis. 
The chapter examines the changing nature of agri-food 
production systems and shows how the way food provi-
sioning is conceptualized, framed and debated changes 
over time. Analysis of past debates about industrial agri-
culture and more recent calls for the ‘sustainable intensi-
fication of global agriculture’ (Beddington 2010) reveals 
important differences in terms of external pressures that 
in part shape restructuring processes, even if the main-
stream mantra remains essentially productivist. This 
more recent period of agri-food restructuring is charac-
terized by the need for an effective rather than exploita-
tive use of resources, in response to growing concerns 
about the depletion and rising costs of energy supplies, 
population growth and climate change.
Such a ‘mode of thinking’ is significantly influenced 
by past events and a realization that energy-greedy pro-
duction systems that propelled food systems in the 1980s 
and 1990s are no longer workable or sustainable (Jarosz 
2009; Harding 2010). Food has thus become a touch-
stone for wider environmental discourses. As Harding 
(2010: 4) puts it, ‘feelings about eating and not eating are 
more immediate than thoughts about rainforests; like the 
energy or water embedded in the produce we buy, many 
fears, including fundamental ones about life and death, 
destruction and incorporation, are already embedded 
in food’. As we shall see later in this chapter, these feel-
ings, fears and anxieties (Jackson 2010a) have been com-
pounded by recent global price increases and the trends 
that food analysts suggest they reflect.
First though, it is useful to think about food more 
generally and to consider why we – as humans – relate 
to it in the ways Harding and others (e.g. Belasco 2008) 
suggest that we do. The first point to note is that food 
extends well beyond its obvious biological significance 
as the protein for sustaining life. It is something that 
one relates to on a very human scale – it reflects who 
we are. According to Atkinson (1991) food is a ‘liminal 
substance’ that links humans and nature. It also reveals 
important social, cultural and economic geographies. 
On the social side, there are inequalities in terms of food 
access, good nutrition and the reported problems with 
obesity and diet, often tied to socio-spatial inequalities 
in terms of wealth and education (for a critical review 
of these issues, see Guthman 2011). Food also has cul-
tural significance. Thus, ‘food shapes us and expresses 
us even more definitively than our furniture or houses 
or utensils do’ (Visser 1986: 12). Think, for example, 
about the different places associated with eating food 
(e.g. roadside café, Burger King, a Michelin-starred res-
taurant) and the different behaviours associated with 
them. There are also cultural associations between dif-
ferent cultural groups and ethnic or national cuisines 
(e.g. the favourite dish in the UK is Tikka ­Masala –  
this curry dish originated in the first Indian restaurants 
in Soho, London in the 1970s and exemplifies the cross-
cultural origin of some foods), as well as a range of cul-
tural images used to market and sell food. Finally, the 
economic significance of food is enormous: for instance, 
one only has to think about the investment and the num-
ber of people involved in the production, processing 
and retailing of food. In the USA, for example, almost  
10 per cent of US Gross Domestic Product is food-related.
Thus it is quite easy to make a case as to why food 
matters as an object of study in human geography. How-
ever, tracing material and metaphorical associations with 
food is less obvious because they are connected together 
in complex ways and often ‘hidden’ as incidental parts 
of everyday life. For example, drinking a cup of coffee 
has numerous social and geographic connotations (Gid-
dens 2001): it has symbolic value (as part of day-to-day 
life); it is a drug (caffeine provides ‘extra lift’, but coffee 
drinkers would not be seen as ‘drug users’); it represents 
past social and economic relationships (e.g. in terms of 
colonization, mass consumption); and it is a symbol of 
globalization and world trade links (e.g. global brands 
like Nescafé and Starbucks). Geographers argue that 
one cannot separate these localized, mundane acts from 
larger social settings that extend around the world. This 
realization about the need to trace ‘connections’ between 
food production and consumption, sparked in part by 
on-going public debates about obesity, food risks and so 
on, has become central to agri-food studies and has been 
given further impetus more recently by debates about 
food security and the interdependence of food systems 
with wider environmental and socio-economic systems 
(Maye and Kirwan 2013; Hinrichs 2014).
A key feature of geographical research in this area 
involves thinking about where and how food is produced, 
how it is retailed and how and where it is consumed. The 
routes traced by particular foodstuffs from ‘farm to fork’ 
are often referred to as a ‘food chain’ (or ‘network’) and 
geographers have attempted to ‘map’ the system of connec-
tions for different products, which may vary both in com-
plexity and geographical coverage. Hartwick (1998: 425) 

304    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
countries are reportedly linked together in ‘highly indus-
trialised and increasingly globalised networks of insti-
tutions and products, constituting an agri-food system’ 
(Whatmore 1995: 37).
The global food economy is not new. For example, 
Friedmann and McMichael (1989) argued that relations 
between agriculture and industry have historically been 
more global than generally thought. Using the concept 
of food regimes, they linked international patterns of 
food production and consumption to the development of 
the capitalist system since the 1870s. They identified three 
food regimes, each one representing the modern food sys-
tem of its time (see Spotlight box 15.1). Thus, there has 
been a global dimension to the geography of food supply 
for some time and, as we will see later in the chapter, the 
food regime concept is now being reapplied in the context 
of the ‘new food crisis’ (McMichael 2009; Sage 2013).
The main criticism of this conceptualisation is its view 
of the globalization of agriculture as a logical progres-
sion (similar in this respect to modernisation theory). In 
reality, it is much more unstable. Take the fast food chain 
McDonalds for example, often heralded as symbolic of 
global mass food consumption. Its global presence is in 
fact atypical of the complex and highly uneven process 
of globalization that has reshaped food production since 
the post-war period. Much less contentious in these 
debates is identifying the key agents involved. FitzSim-
mons (1997), among others, identifies TNCs as the pri-
mary agents of globalization in the agri-food sector; to 
her mind, they sit at the centre of webs of relations that 
link farming, processing and marketing. Food retailing 
in Europe and America is concentrated in the hands of a 
few supermarkets and these agents also play an important 
role in developing regulatory systems that ensure their 
dominance over the supply of key food products. It is also 
agreed that TNCs and corporate retailers played signifi-
cant roles in the ‘industrialization’ of farming and food 
production activities, which, initially at least, were mostly 
concentrated in the developed world.
15.2.1 Industrialized agriculture in the developed world
Encouraged by governments as a response to food short-
ages and the need to raise productivity after the Second 
World War, ‘industrial farming has dominated . . . agri-
culture in the EU and North America since the 1950s’ 
(Millstone and Lang 2008: 38). This system of farming is 
particularly prominent in livestock (i.e. meat, dairy, and 
eggs production) and is designed to maximize productiv-
ity in the shortest timeframe (Sage 2012). Key features 
of the industrial model of farming include a specializa-
tion of labour, product specialization and intensification, 
and assembly-line type production. It has led to three 
defines food chains as ‘significant production, distribution 
and consumption nodes, and the connecting links between 
them, together with social, cultural and natural condi-
tions involved in commodity movements’. Geographers 
have thus adopted the supply chain metaphor to literally 
trace and follow the nature of ‘connections’ for particu-
lar commodities (Cook et al. 2006). The food chain is not 
a new concept but it has been re-cast as a ‘food system’, 
‘food circuit’, ‘food network’ or ‘food convention’ (see, for 
example, Maye and Ilbery 2006; Morris and Kirwan 2010). 
Despite the varied terminologies, the food chain continues 
to have symbolic and applied values.
Food, therefore, is a geographical topic. This includes 
its role in society and economy, and the food chain can 
be used as an overall organizing framework to explore 
geographies of food production. The rest of the chapter 
is divided into four parts: first, past and present modes 
of global food supply are examined, including the chang-
ing nature of global food chains; second, some of the 
ways in which producers and consumers are beginning 
to establish alternative systems of food provision are 
outlined; third, debates about food security are exam-
ined, including its definition and interpretations about 
how food should be produced now and in the future; and 
finally, the chapter summarizes some recent food chain 
trends and discussions about the ethics of food produc-
tion, recognizing the need for geographers to continue to 
critically interrogate the conceptual foundations of food 
production and supply.
15.2 Geographies of food production 
and global supply
This section examines farming, food production and 
global food supply. It outlines some of the ways geog-
raphers and other food analysts have framed global 
food production until relatively recently. Two processes 
are significant: the industrialization of farming and the 
­globalization of food supply. After introducing some 
concepts, case studies of global food commodity chains 
in different parts of the world are explored and then some 
questions are raised, particularly about the relationship 
between agricultural productivity, food governance and 
trade. Globalization is often defined in terms of the 
integration of systems among geographically dispersed 
places (see Dicken 2015). Crucially, this process of global 
integration has been guided by powerful transnational 
corporations (TNCs), institutions and actors, which in 
this context led to a new political economy of agricul-
ture, epitomized by the mass production of manufactured 
food. Despite inequalities, developed and developing

Global food regimes since the 1870s
First regime: pre-industrial (1870s–1920s)
This involved settler colonies supplying unprocessed 
and semi-processed foods and materials to the met-
ropolitan core of North America and Western Europe. 
Characterized by extensive forms of capital accumu-
lation, the main products were grains and meat. The 
regime slowly disintegrated when agricultural production 
in developed countries competed with cheap imports 
and trade barriers were erected.
Second regime: industrial (1920s–1970s)
This regime relates to the productivist phase of agri-
cultural change, focused on North America and the 
development of agri-industrial complexes based 
around grain-fed livestock production. Characterized 
by intensive forms of capital accumulation, the second 
regime incorporated developed and developing nations 
into commodity production systems. Agricultural sur-
pluses and environmental disbenefits undermined this 
phase of production in the 1970s.
Third regime: post-industrial (1980s onwards)
This regime refers to the crisis surrounding industrialized 
farming systems and involves the production of fresh 
fruit and vegetables for the global market, the continued 
reconstitution of food, and the supply of inputs for ‘elite’ 
consumption in developed countries. Characterized by 
a flexible form of capital accumulation, this regime is 
dominated by the restructuring activities of agribusiness 
TNCs and corporate retailers.

and McMichael (1989)
shifted towards the largest firms. FitzSimmons also iden-
tified a process of vertical disintegration, whereby seg-
ments of the production process were subcontracted out 
to smaller scale growers. The second example is poultry, 
a key product when it comes to integrated production 
systems and the first livestock sector to industrialize. 
Constance et al. (2013) provide a historical analysis of 
poultry production and processing in the United States. 
They show how the locus of production activity shifted 
from the North-east, where it started in the 1930s, to 
the South by the 1950s. Underemployed farm labour, a 
favourable climate, lower wages and less unionization, 
cotton-crop failures, and the stabilization of feed prices 
were key factors that made the South an attractive place 
to locate. A model of vertically-integrated production, 
based on contract production and non-union labour, was 
developed. In a bid to increase market share, a number 
of mergers and acquisitions took place in the 1980s 
and 1990s, leading to a process of horizontal integra-
tion and industry consolidation that created regional 
monopsonies. This model of a few very large vertically 
integrated poultry farms anchoring agro-industrial dis-
tricts is efficient in that it produces low-priced chicken 
for consumers, but it has also been criticized as a system 
of asymmetrical power relationships that marginalizes 
contract producers, workers in processing plants, and 
rural communities.
In these and other examples, it is often the non-
farm sectors of the agri-food system that have become 
most industrialized and dominated by TNCs. This has 
important food production trends in the developed world: 
first, the concentration of agricultural production on a 
limited number of large-scale farms; second, an increase 
in capital expenditure on major agricultural inputs like 
chemicals; and third, a growth in the processing and man-
ufacturing of food. These developments explain why it 
is now vital to view farming in the wider context of an 
agri-food system, where the production sector itself is 
inextricably linked to various ‘upstream’ (input supplies) 
and ‘downstream’ (processing, distribution and market-
ing) industries. In many cases, the food supply system is 
also dominated by large agribusinesses which, accord-
ing to Davis and Goldberg’s (1957) seminal work, are the 
sum of all operations involved in the manufacture and 
distribution of farm supplies, the production operation 
of the farm, storage, processing and distribution of farm 
commodities and items made from them. These agribusi-
nesses often develop commodity chains beyond national 
boundaries (Wallace 1985; McMichael 2009).
A number of studies have charted the industrializa-
tion of agriculture, especially in the United States. Two 
brief examples are presented here. The first is the Sali-
nas Valley in California where lettuce production was 
transformed between 1950 and 1980 by two key things: 
intensification, as a result of a shift to more investment 
in intensive crops, increased labour productivity and 
intensified planting; and restructuring, whereby large 
farms dominated sales (FitzSimmons 1986). By 1978, the 
ten largest grower-shippers in the region sold 65 per cent 
of all lettuce. Over time, therefore, power and control 

306    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
in newly agriculturalizing countries because of low-cost 
labour, government support (via structural adjustment 
programmes), good global communication links and 
the ability to produce high quality/value products for the 
developed world market. There are a number of detailed 
accounts of the export trade in high-value foods (see, for 
example, Freidberg 2004; van der Ploeg 2010).
The example used here is salmon farming in Chile. It 
is mostly located in Chiloe, a large island that runs along 
the southern third of the Chilean coast and is charac-
terized by a mild, rainy climate and protected inlets. 
Since the 1990s, the salmon farming industry has been 
growing rapidly; in 1987 Chile produced 2,000 tonnes 
of Pacific salmon, but did not produce any Atlantic 
salmon (Phyne and Mansilla 2003). By 2000 Chile pro-
duced 17 per cent of the world’s Atlantic salmon and 
also dominated the global production of Pacific salmon. 
At its peak, in 2006, Chile contributed 38 per cent of 
the world’s salmon trade and was the leading exporter 
of farmed salmon after Norway (Iizuka and Katz 2015). 
However, the sector suffered decline in 2007 as a result of 
a salmon disease crisis, which decimated stocks (Atlantic 
salmon stocks dropped from 400,000 tonnes in 2005 to 
100,000 tonnes in 2010). Figure 15.1 shows a simplified 
model for the salmon aquaculture supply chain which 
starts when eggs are hatched and the fingerlings raised 
near the hatchery; once fingerlings become smolts, they 
are raised in smolt-rearing facilities in fresh-water cages; 
after a period of 12 months they are shipped to sea-water 
cages and raised for a further 12–18 months (thanks to 
new feeds, this grow-out stage is reducing rapidly); har-
vested salmon enter processing plants (with automated 
feeding systems and where labour is most concentrated) 
and are prepared by standards set in Japan and America. 
Over 80 per cent of the product is sold to Japanese and 
American retail markets.
This case study shows how the Chilean salmon farm-
ing industry is inserted into a ‘buyer-driven’ com-
modity chain, where major distributors and retailers in 
export markets shape the nature of production. Power is 
at the retail end of the chain rather than the production 
end. Essentially, the industry is characterized by govern-
ance from lead firms and external authorities (Iizuka and 
Katz 2015; cf. van der Ploeg 2010). In the middle part of 
the salmon supply chain there is also clear evidence of 
concentration and squeezing, with forward integration 
by feed giants and increasing concentration of produc-
tion by foreign and domestic firms. At the production 
end of the chain, benefits are skewed in favour of those 
in management positions. Grow-out sites and process-
ing plants are where most local people work. Wages are 
low and the working conditions poor, with 80 per cent 
of plant workers being female. Analysts of the sanitary 
occurred through two processes (Goodman et al. 1987): 
appropriationism, where certain agricultural inputs 
are replaced by ‘industrial’ alternatives (e.g. synthetic 
chemicals replacing manure); and substitutionism, 
which focuses on outputs rather than inputs and is con-
cerned with the increased utilization of non-agricultural 
raw materials and the creation of industrial substitutes 
for food and fibre (e.g. sweeteners for sugar). Agri-food 
systems are different from other production systems 
because agriculture is bound by biological processes 
and cycles, and the essential aim of appropriationism 
and substitutionism is to ‘replace’ nature. Agribusiness 
TNCs also attempt to increase their influence over farm-
ing indirectly through a process of formal subsumption, 
where arrangements or contracts are made with farm-
ers to provide ‘raw materials’ for their value-adding food 
manufacturing activities. Agricultural industrialization is 
also increasingly global in scale, where food commodity 
chains lengthen and producers become ‘distanced’ from 
consumers.
The overall key pattern of agricultural industrializa-
tion is concentration in particular sectors, regions and 
individual countries characterized by large farm busi-
nesses that have adopted intensive farming methods and 
become integrated into global food networks. In the 
European Union, for instance, 80 per cent of agricultural 
production is concentrated on less than 20 per cent of 
farms in particular ‘hot spots’, including East Anglia, the 
Paris Basin, southern Netherlands, and Emilia Romagna 
in north-east Italy. In response to various issues in the 
developed world market, a key feature of TNCs and 
major retailers has been their attempt to relocate the pro-
duction function of the agri-food system to new agricul-
tural spaces, often in less developed countries (LDCs). 
This shift was associated with the intensive production of 
high-quality, high-value food commodities.
15.2.2 Developing world agriculture
Goodman and Watts (1997) argue that the classic export 
commodities (e.g. coffee, tea, sugar, cocoa) associ-
ated with the LDCs have been complemented by high-
value foods, including fruits, vegetables and shellfish. 
By the 1990s, 24 low-middle income countries annually 
exported over US$500 million of high-value foods; 
just five countries (Brazil, Mexico, China, Argentina 
and Kenya) accounted for 40 per cent of such exports 
from the LDCs. The growth in high-value food exports 
reflects various things, including: technical changes in 
the food industry, the liberalization of world trade, and 
dietary changes in the developed world, with high-value 
foods produced to satisfy consumer tastes. Agribusiness 
TNCs are also attracted to high-value food production

apace (Gardner 2013) and is criticised because countries 
focus on growing for the global market at the expense of 
staple products required for the domestic market. The 
Brazil case shows a continued focus on global demand, 
but in this instance the emphasis is on growing bulk food 
commodities like soybeans, as well as expanding its beef 
markets, with increasing reliance on GMO technology 
from abroad to develop resistant beans, an innovation 
which farmers want but environmentalists reject on the 
grounds that these forms of bioeconomy ‘lock in’ Brazil 
to certain, technology-reliant, ways of farming.
Certain types of productivist, intensive farming sys-
tems have relocated to ‘peripheral’ regions to take advan-
tage of local conditions (for example, cheaper labour, 
land). Also significant is the diffusion of the vertical 
integration food governance model to other countries 
around the world. Processes of agricultural industri-
alization and globalization are therefore more complex 
than a shift from core to periphery. The model of poul-
try production developed in the US South, for example, 
around agro-industrial districts, has since been adopted 
and applied elsewhere as a low-cost production system. 
The outcome of this diffusion process is the creation, by 
transnational agribusinesses, of a global poultry agri-
food complex that targets the best production areas and 
the most profitable consumer markets. These complex 
governance arrangements include powerful US companies 
crisis that severely damaged the sector in 2007 argue it 
was the result of overexploitation and overconcentration 
of fish farms (Iizuka and Katz 2015). In this example, and 
in others cited, global food production raises significant 
questions, especially in terms of who truly benefits.
15.2.3 Global food production hubs and the  
diffusion of governance innovations
Recent studies of global agriculture (e.g. Gardner 2013) 
reveal sustained and increasing regional spatial concen-
tration for certain food/crop types. North America and 
Europe are now important areas for maize and wheat 
production. China and India collectively grow a quarter 
of the world’s wheat and over half the global produc-
tion of rice. A large proportion of the world’s animal 
feed is produced in South America, North America and 
Eastern Europe. Not all of these systems will be highly 
industrialized but most are, or will be, moving rapidly in 
that direction.
A key trend in food production concentration is the 
rise of newly agriculturalizing countries (NACs). 
This idea is not new (Friedman 1993), but Spotlight box 
15.2 introduces a case study of Brazil to show how some 
NACs are attempting to become new global food produc-
tion hubs. NACs were originally associated with world 
trade in high value foods. This process has continued 

308    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
influence of food policy in shaping patterns of global 
food production and supply. This is an area that has also 
faced significant criticism.
International trade in food has expanded dramati-
cally in recent decades. Between 1961 and 1999, there 
was a four-fold increase in the amount of food exported 
(Millstone and Lang 2008). In 2012, the USA and the EU 
dominated agricultural exports (16 per cent and 14 per 
cent respectively) and imports (12 per cent and 17 per 
cent respectively) (Gardner 2013). However, the pat-
tern of world food trade is changing. The simple two 
way north-south world trade exchange has now become 
much more complex. In recent years, for example, devel-
oping countries have increased production of staples 
(e.g. wheat, maize) and now export to each other, as 
well as exporting high value fruit, vegetables and meat 
to Europe and North America. As noted earlier, trade in 
high value foods has increased rapidly. China and other 
BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa) 
are increasingly involved in world food trade.
One of the drivers of this process has been the World 
Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO’s Agreement 
on Agriculture promoted trade liberalization through 
reductions in agricultural subsidies, tariffs and import 
quotas. More than 150 countries are signatories of 
like Tyson, who have joint-venture poultry operations 
all over the world, but also companies like JBS, which 
is Brazilian-owned and is now the largest multi-protein 
processor in the world.
15.2.4 Trade patterns, food policy  
and global governance
Agricultural industrialization is thus extending its global 
reach; it is also clear that large-scale agribusinesses and 
corporate retailers have successfully linked regional 
economies and food sectors to a global system of food 
production and consumption. However, these systems 
of provision also raise questions about, for example, 
their suitability for LDCs, especially their contribution 
to sharp inequalities in income, productivity and tech-
nology compared to the sector producing staple foods 
(i.e. foods that are eaten regularly and provide a large 
proportion of a population’s energy and nutrients, such 
as cereals or tubers) and the unsustainable nature of agri-
cultural practices often favoured by agribusiness TNCs. 
Questions also abound about the logic and impacts of 
industrialized farming, particularly in relation to food 
production, fair trade and environmental responsibil-
ity. We turn now to look in more detail at the role and 
Spotlight box 15.2
The rise of Brazil as a ‘global farm’
Brazil is rapidly overtaking other countries in food pro-
duction and exports. In particular, Brazil is emerging as 
the world’s lead producer of beef, a commodity that is 
being consumed in growing quantities globally every 
year. In the past decade, Brazil quadrupled beef exports, 
overtaking Australia as the world’s largest exporter. The 
rise of Brazil as a ‘global farm’ is also about a second 
commodity: soya beans – it’s the country’s largest food 
crop, with an estimated value of US$17 billion in 2008.
Soya was mostly grown in the south of Brazil until 
the 1960s. Since then plant breeders and agricultural 
scientists have developed varieties that can grow across 
most of the country. It is now competing with the USA to 
be the world’s largest soya exporter. Transgenic crops 
are also important. The first GM soya plant – a herbi-
cide-resistant bean, developed and sold by Monsanto 
(a US-based company) – was approved for cultivation 
in 1998. A judge later issued a moratorium to block 
the use of the seed but Brazilian farmers ignored the 
legislation and started to import it (illegally!) from Argen-
tina. Its use became so widespread that the Brazilian 
president signed a law in 2003 to legalize it. The law 
was designed to better control imports and to protect 
Brazilian seed companies. Brazil now has 21 types of 
GM plant approved for use in the field. GM soya makes 
up 70 per cent of the Brazilian soya market.
Brazil currently relies on GM products developed 
abroad, although in 2010 its biosafety commission 
approved the first transgenic seed to be developed by 
Brazilian scientists. At the moment transgenic crops 
used in Brazil help farmers to fight against weeds and 
insects – they do not increase the amount of food pro-
duced by individual plants. Pro-GM scientists argue 
more productive varieties could eventually take pressure 
off the Amazon rainforest, which has been extensively 
cleared to make way for agriculture. Producing for a 
global market thus offers economic benefits but it can 
also come at a significant cost.

(FMs), box schemes, community supported agriculture, 
buying-groups and food cooperatives, and home deliver-
ies (Renting et al. 2003; Kneafsey et al. 2008; Little et al. 
2010). In 2012, 7.8 per cent of US farms were marketing 
foods locally, for example (USDA 2015). This interest is 
often seen as a response to the environmental and socio-
economic disbenefits associated with agricultural indus-
trialization and global food supply.
Many authors have referred to the distinctions drawn 
between ‘conventional’ and ‘alternative’ agri-food sys-
tems (see Table 15.1). Binary opposites such as ‘qual-
ity’, ‘embedded’, ‘sustainable’, ‘traditional’ and ‘natural’ 
characterize alternative food production systems (Ilbery 
and Maye 2005). In reality, these binary opposites are 
not as simple and clear-cut as this. For example, while 
organic food may be regarded as ‘alternative’, most 
organic sales still occur through ‘conventional’ super-
markets. Interest in the alternative food economy has 
also led some geographers to proclaim the emergence of 
‘alternative geographies of food’, which revolve around 
changing production and consumption relations that give 
rise to new regional and local food ‘complexes’. It has 
been argued, for example, that alternative geographies 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
(Carolan 2011). However, concerns have been voiced 
about the unfairness of global trade because of the 
continued use of national subsidies and tariffs. For 
example, a number of trading blocs exist that have sig-
nificant power when it comes to how food is traded. 
These regional trading blocs sit below the GATT/WTO 
governance structure and include the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (an agreement between the USA, 
Canada and Mexico) and the European Union (which 
comprises 28 countries). Effectively these arrangements 
promote patterns of bilateral food trade and also influ-
ence how food is grown and traded, because they distort 
markets. Developed nations use direct or, as is now more 
common, indirect or de-coupled payments (i.e. the 
payment is deemed non-trade distorting because it is 
independent of production levels) to support their farm-
ers. As Carolan (2011: 20) remarks, ‘these payments still 
shield producers from low prices . . . they make farmers 
deaf to market signals, allowing them to continue to 
(over)produce and profit even when the costs of produc-
tion exceed what the market is willing to bear’.
What this tells us is that free trade is rarely fair. At 
the time of writing the latest debate in this area con-
cerns the development of the Transatlantic Trade and 
Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal. This is still being 
negotiated, and hotly debated, but if it goes ahead it will 
effectively create a trading area that would stretch as far 
as Alaska to the Black Sea. It is proposed that standards 
between the United States and the EU will be harmonized 
across a plethora of issues, including animal welfare, food 
safety and public services. Lobbyists argue the process is 
undemocratic and designed by and for big corporations. 
Many argue it will also inevitably lead to a reduction in 
standards on both sides. If approved, TTIP is likely to 
significantly influence how and where food is produced 
and traded globally in the future.
15.3 Alternative geographies of food: 
concepts and case studies
One important way to respond to some of the above 
criticisms is to establish alternative food networks 
(AFNs). There has been a huge resurgence of interest 
within many developed market economies in foods of 
local and regional provenance (Watts et al. 2005; Maye 
and Kirwan 2010; Tregear 2011; Goodman et al. 2012; 
Rippon 2014). These include consumer initiatives like the 
Slow Food movement and fair trade, as well as a growth 
in food purchases from ‘alternative’ supply chains rather 
than supermarket outlets, including farmers’ markets

Table 15.1  Distinctions between ‘conventional’ and 
‘alternative’ food supply systems

310    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
of food may be associated with agriculturally peripheral 
regions because such regions have, ‘. . .  for a variety 
of reasons, failed to fully engage with the productivist 
conventions that have predominated in the agri-food sys-
tem in the second half of the twentieth century’ (Parrott 
et al. 2002: 243). Goodman (2003) draws a comparison 
between American and European alternative food prac-
tices, conceptualizing US alternatives more as social and 
oppositional movements, in contrast to the EU’s more 
endogenous interventions, linked to historical and cul-
tural traditions of product and place.
One can equally talk about alternative geographies 
of food in a global sense, notably through the interna-
tional fair trade and organic food movements that chal-
lenge exploitative relations in agri-food systems. These 
networks offer ethical and ecological possibilities that 
counter some of the negative externalities associated 
with conventional food supply (Maye et al. 2007). Inter-
national trade often appears as a remote concern, but 
when commodity prices fall it has devastating impacts 
on the livelihoods of millions of small producers. The 
prices paid for coffee, for example, have not increased in 
real terms in the last 40 years, whereas the costs of inputs 
like fertilizers and machinery have. Low coffee prices in 
the early 1990s had catastrophic impacts on the lives of 
millions of small farmers, mostly in LDCs, who were 
producing coffee at a loss. However, despite the positive 
benefits of fair trade and organic foods, both sectors have 
been subjected to recent debates about ‘mainstreaming’ 
and ‘conventionalisation’.
Fair trade offers an alternative to overcome the injus-
tices of free trade, guaranteeing producers a fair price. It 
was started some 50 years ago by development agencies 
and charities like Oxfam and Traidcraft who realized the 
important role consumers could play in improving the 
lives of impoverished producers. Fair trade is now avail-
able in most European supermarket chains, with some 
products achieving 15 per cent of the national market 
share. It is, quite rightly, a global success story and fair 
trade consumerism is celebrated as enabling better eve-
ryday ethical practice. The success of these networks 
depends upon the ability and willingness of Northern 
consumers to pay redistributive premiums for such com-
modities. Some fair trade organizations have started to 
compete on price, lowering premiums paid to produc-
ers and aggressively pursuing ‘mainstreaming’ strategies. 
This parallels developments in organic farming where 
some have argued that organic supply chains have become 
‘conventionalised’ (especially in terms of rent structures, 
the size of businesses controlling production, conven-
tional patterns of marketing and distribution), suggest-
ing that it is often very difficult for alternative economies 
to maintain their differences from the global capitalist 
economy (Guthman 2004; Goodman et al. 2012).
Spotlight box 15.3 provides a summary of two con-
cepts central to an understanding of the development 
of ‘alternative geographies of food’. These and related 
concepts will be examined further below, via some 
empirical case studies; hopefully, they will also help you 
to think critically about the blurring between ‘conven-
tional’ and ‘alternative’ systems of food provision. A 
simple ‘alternative geography of food’ does not exist. 
The processes affecting ‘alternative’ food chains are 
complex. We explore some of these issues using three 
case studies that attempt to ‘reconnect’ food production 
and consumption and make a statement about the alter-
native food economy, especially in terms of the nature 
of the food chain.
Spotlight box 15.3
Conceptualizing AFNs: key concepts
Short food supply chains (SFSCs)
The key characteristic of SFSCs is that foods reach the 
final consumer having been transmitted through a supply 
chain ‘embedded’ with value-laden information concern-
ing the mode of production, provenance and distinctive 
quality assets of the product. In many cases, the number 
of nodes between the primary producer and the final 
consumer will also be minimized (Renting et al. 2003). 
While this ‘re-connection process’ is best demonstrated 
through forms of direct marketing and thus face-to-face 
contact between producer and consumer, Marsden et 
al. (2000) identified two further types of SFSC: spatial 
proximity and spatially extended. The former is where 
products are sold through local outlets in the region, 
locality or place of production, so that the consumer is 
immediately aware of the locally embedded nature of 
the product at the point of retail. In contrast, the latter 
occur when products are sold to consumers (e.g. via the 
Internet) who are located outside the region of produc-
tion and/ or have no personal knowledge of the area.
Social embeddedness
This propagates the idea that economic behaviour is 
embedded in, and mediated by, a complex and extensive 

Chapter 15  Geographies of food production    311
(Watts et al. 2005; Ilbery and Maye 2010). This is often 
defined as a process of relocalization, in which locally 
distinctive quality food products (see Plate 15.1, for exam-
ple) are transferred to regional and national markets as a 
15.3.1 Quality food
One of the dominant features of AFNs, particularly 
in Europe, has been the attempt to link ‘product and 
place’ in order to add value to agricultural products

web of local social relations. In the case of local (‘alterna-
tive’) foods, both economic (e.g. price, markets) and social 
(e.g. local ties, trust) relations are vital for success (for 
details see Hinrichs 2000). By stressing the role of social 
relations in generating the trust necessary for economic 
transactions, it is easy to make the false assumption that 
social embeddedness relates just to alternative food 
systems. In reality, all economic relations are socially 
embedded in a range of contrasting ways and so there 
are different degrees of embeddedness in all food supply 
systems (Winter 2003). Nevertheless, social interaction 
between producer and consumer can make the difference 
between success and failure for local food businesses. 
This can take the form of acknowledgement, attention, 
respect, friendship and sociability, often subsumed within 
the concept of ‘regard’ (Sage 2003; Kirwan 2006).

312    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
in all these examples is the direct nature of the supply 
chain and the important social and economic benefits 
that accrue from these types of food transaction. This 
is illustrated in Plate 15.2, which shows the direct inter-
action between producers and consumers at a farmers’ 
market. To help explore some of these processes in more 
detail, the second case focuses on an organic meat pro-
ducer business (Ilbery and Maye 2005).
The organic farm and on-farm butchery is located 
in the Northumberland uplands. Established in 1998, 
the business produces and retails a range of organi-
cally reared meat products, using local branding and 
traceability. The business supply chain is reproduced 
in Figure 15.2 and records both the upstream inputs 
coming into the business and the downstream links in 
terms of how and where final products are sold. This 
‘whole chain’ approach extends previous conceptuali-
sations of SFSCs which focused only on downstream 
elements of the supply chain (cf. Marsden et al. 2000).
Most of the inputs coming into the farm are from local 
suppliers. Constructed to add and retain value from pri-
mary production, the business sources some cattle, sheep, 
pigs and poultry from other organic farms in the region. 
All livestock are slaughtered at the (organically accred-
ited) abattoir at Whitley Bay in North Tyneside, Tyne 
and Wear (about 20 miles from the farm), and then deliv-
ered to the on-farm butchery to be processed and pack-
aged for retail. Businesses like this have to ‘dip in’ and 
‘dip out’ of ‘conventional’ supply chains because of the 
ways in which the dominant agri-food system is currently 
structured. The meat products are sold through various 
SFSCs, for example direct sales, local/regional specialist 
food shops and caterers, and mail order. Meat sales over 
the Internet are minimal. Over time, the business reduced 
sales output at farmers’ markets and stopped supply-
ing (specialist) butchers in the region in favour of more 
mechanism to provide a valuable economic stimulant and 
reduce the deleterious impact of national and EU sub-
sidy reforms and increasing trade liberalization. In other 
words, quality and locality are inextricably linked. In par-
ticular, regional speciality food products have been linked 
to particular places in this way, especially via a formal 
system of quality food labels and the establishment of 
regional speciality food groups. The most notable exam-
ple of this is the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) 
and the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) qual-
ity labels introduced by the European Union in the early 
1990s to ‘protect’ and ‘promote’ food and drink products 
with a recognizable geographical origin (Rippon 2014). 
Groups of producers in Europe can thus apply for either 
a PDO label (product originates from a specific place and 
is linked to its natural environment) or PGI label (linked 
to place, but not necessarily in terms of raw materials). 
These labels protect producers from attempted copies 
and act as a marketing device. These changes have been 
interpreted as symbolizing a quality turn (Goodman 
2003), with particular emphasis on specialist food pro-
duction, especially in ‘marginal economies’.
In terms of geography, the UK already has 60 PDO/
PGI labels. Specialist cheeses dominate the PDOs, indi-
cating that these are made exclusively from local raw 
materials (e.g. Stilton cheeses). In contrast, drinks domi-
nate the PGIs. The sales value of British Geographical 
Indications in 2010 was €5.506 billion and food and 
agricultural products comprised €1.059 billion (Rippon 
2014). There are now more than 595 PDOs and 601 PGI 
designations in the EU, with a southern concentration 
in places like France and Italy (over 150 each, including 
cheeses, wines and meats, such as Parmigiano-Reggiano, 
Roquefort and Champagne) and Greece and Portugal 
(over 80 each), compared with limited numbers in north-
ern member countries (e.g. Finland, Denmark and Ire-
land). This implies that regional/speciality food has more 
cultural significance in some European societies than in 
others (Parrott et al. 2002). Protected status thus provides 
cultural benefits by preserving place-based identities. 
They also provide exclusive control over geographical 
names, allowing businesses to exploit the positive ideas 
that consumers have about particular territorial names 
(Rippon 2014). Some countries have developed this form 
of market premium more than others.
15.3.2 Direct food
Studies of the local food sector in the USA, UK and other 
parts of Europe typically include some of the archetypal 
examples noted earlier, especially farmers’ markets, box 
schemes, farm shops and on-farm butchers (Watts et al. 
2005; Maye and Kirwan 2010; USDA 2015). Significant

organization began in November 1994, seeking to edu-
cate the public about the consequences of the industrial 
agricultural system and to persuade more people to par-
ticipate in local, sustainable alternatives. It argued that 
industrial agriculture had eroded soils, made water unfit 
to drink, and increased pesticide resistance in insects; 
the food system had become so centralized that citizens 
lacked control over their food choices. For KCFC, the 
industrialized food system was unhealthy, unjust, unethi-
cal and economically unviable.
The explicit political alternative that emerged from 
this critique was an attempt to create a local, organic 
food system where consumers can get seasonal, fresh 
food at a price that supports farmers who use sustain-
able practices. The KCFC thus connects all actors in the 
food system in a way that sustains and returns control 
‘stable’ alternatives (e.g. independent retail and catering). 
Thus the producer adjusts the supply chain in a bid to 
establish as much control of it as possible.
15.3.3 Community food
Attempts to relocalize food production and establish 
‘alternative’ supply chains also extend beyond farm-
based production. This is an important point. The final 
case study of the Kansas City Food Circle (KCFC) is an 
example of a community food scheme (Hendrickson 
and Heffernan 2002). KCFC is presented as a (local) site 
of resistance within an industrialized food system domi-
nated by global corporations like Con Agra, Cargill, 
and Monsanto whose food chain arrangements are typi-
fied by joint ventures and strategic alliances. The KCFC

314    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
and community-based forms of innovation and alter-
ity (otherness). There is certainly evidence to support 
the need for a broader range of AFNs. Kirwan et al.’s 
(2013) analysis of the Local Food programme in Eng-
land, for example, looked at the types of organization 
responsible for running local food projects and found 
that by far the most common were registered charities, 
followed by a range of community groups and schools. 
Renting et al. (2012) introduce ‘civic food networks’ 
(CFNs) as a useful way to conceptualize new modes of 
food governance and contemporary sources of innova-
tion within agri-food networks. It is an attempt to con-
ceptualize new types of consumer-producer cooperation 
in food networks (i.e. ‘second-generation AFNs’) where 
consumers play an active role. These networks are often 
organized by civic groups (NGOs, charities, etc.) and the 
concept is intended to complement rather than replace 
previous conceptualisations of AFNs and SFSCs. Exam-
ples include consumer co-ops, solidarity buying groups 
of local and organic foods, CSAs and collective urban 
gardening initiatives. The key argument is that the role 
of civil society as a governance mechanism for agri-food 
networks has increased in significance compared to mar-
ket and state actors. As we will see in Section 15.4, these 
debates about AFNs have been further unsettled by recent 
increases in, and volatility of, global food prices alongside 
concerns about food availability. The scale of the discus-
sion has therefore shifted from the regional and the local 
back to the global.
15.4 Food security: questions of scale, 
definition and interpretation
Some of the challenges associated with food security 
have been usefully discussed earlier in this book (see 
Chapter 7). It merits attention here too because it is sig-
nificantly re-shaping how we think about global food 
production. Food security has commonly been associ-
ated with developing countries in recent decades. Given 
the choice and daily availability of foods in supermar-
kets and restaurants, it is easy to see why the thought of 
food shortages or supply chain disruptions might not be 
uppermost in peoples’ minds in most developed market 
economies. However, there is now recognition that the 
food system and issues associated with securing food 
supplies need urgent attention (Maye and Kirwan 2013).
The reason why political interest in food worldwide 
has suddenly arisen is easy to explain: global food prices 
have increased significantly in recent years (House of 
Commons 2009). The significant price spike was in late 
2007, when the price for basic food staples rose sharply 
to local communities. Effectively, the KCFC is about 
creating a new kind of community that recognizes the 
interconnectedness of people through the production and 
consumption of food. The Circle continued to grow, with 
30 organic growers in the region surrounding Kansas City 
signing up to supply food, and roughly 600 consumers. 
The trust-based relationships that the KCFC is trying to 
cultivate between farmers and consumers mirror those 
reported in other similar studies (see, for example, Kneaf-
sey et al. 2008; Little et al. 2010).
15.3.4 Critiquing and redefining AFNs
Given the range and diversity of work on ‘alternative 
geographies of food’, these mechanisms of food supply 
can also be critiqued, especially in terms of the privilege 
assigned to terms like ‘local’ and ‘alternative’. Geogra-
phers and other agri-food researchers are thus asking 
what is ‘alternative’ about the alternative food economy 
(see Whatmore et al. 2003; Maye et al. 2007; Goodman 
et al. 2012). This critique is evident in the critical tone 
of the ‘conventionalisation thesis’ introduced earlier, 
which raises important questions about the alternative 
status of some fair trade and organic food chains. Watts 
et al. (2005) distinguish between ‘weaker’ and ‘stronger’ 
alternative systems of food provision. The former place 
emphasis on quality and the labelling features of locality 
food networks (i.e. the product is key), whereas the latter 
focus on the revalorized and embedded characteristics of 
local food networks (i.e. the supply chain/network and 
nature of relations are key). In the three examples of 
AFNs, the first case study falls within this weaker clas-
sification, whereas the other two are stronger because of 
their emphasis on establishing alternative production-
consumption networks. It is beyond the scope of this 
chapter to enter into debates surrounding the definition 
of terms such as ‘local’, ‘locality’ and ‘regional’ (see Maye 
and Kirwan 2010, Goodman et al. 2012); nevertheless, 
it is important to also note that the literature is divided 
about whether ‘quality’ or ‘local’ is more important in 
local food production. Winter (2003) used the concept 
of defensive localism to suggest that the turn to local 
is more important than a turn to quality based on, for 
example, organic or ecological principles. The turn to 
local is not just about alternative food systems; instead, 
it can cover different forms of agriculture and a range of 
consumer motivations.
Goodman et al. (2012) suggest that ‘first-generation’ 
AFNs (regional PDO/PGI locality foods, organic agri-
culture, local food networks that involve farmers’ mar-
kets, CSAs and box schemes) are now being renewed and 
complemented by a ‘second generation’ of relocalization 
initiatives, many of which involve collective, non-market

scarce natural resources. Various environmental and 
resource challenges require urgent consideration, notably 
the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced by 
the food system, the need to reduce dependency on fos-
sil fuels, and the need to reduce the depletion of natural 
resources and ecosystem services on which food depends 
(especially soil and water) (House of Commons 2009: 13; 
Sage 2013). Any response to the above crisis is not simply 
about producing more food; it is about doing it in a way 
that is sustainable and uses resources less exploitatively. 
Increases in food production will thus need to be achieved, 
making an effective, rather than exploitative, use of 
resources (Ilbery and Maye 2010). This has been described 
elsewhere as ‘an unprecedented double challenge’ (House 
of Commons 2009: 13). The following sub-sections con-
sider two aspects of this debate: first, how the term food 
security is defined and for whom; and secondly, some ways 
food analysts suggest we respond to the challenge.
15.4.1 Food security for whom?
The emphasis in much of the discussion on the current, 
perceived ‘global food security crisis’ is about the need to 
produce more food (i.e. food availability). There is rec-
ognition that increases in production must be consistent 
with systems that are sustainable and that we produce 
food that consumers want. However, this policy places 
too little emphasis on broader understandings of food 
security, which include questions about access and utiliza-
tion as well as availability (Maye and Kirwan 2013). The 
standard definition of food security is that given by the 
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in its 
1996 World Food Summit Plan of Action:
Food security exists when all people, at all times, have 
physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and 
nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food 
preferences for an active and healthy life.
(quoted in Ericksen 2008: 234)
Food security has multiple meanings for different peo-
ple and organizations and varied scales of interpretation 
(global, national, regional, local, the household). It can be 
viewed as a ‘master frame’ with several distinct claims to 
ownership or, in other words, there is ‘contested ownership 
behind the apparent consensus on food security’ (Mooney 
and Hunt 2009: 470; see also Maye and Kirwan 2013; 
Hopma and Woods 2014). Three collective action frames 
that encompass food security as a master frame have been 
suggested by Mooney and Hunt (2009) and these are:
● Food security associated with hunger and malnutrition;
● Food security as a component of a community’s devel-
opmental whole; and
on international commodity markets (the price for wheat 
rose by 50 per cent and for rice by 20 per cent, for exam-
ple). The price spike was unusual in one important way 
in that ‘[it] applies to almost all major food and feed 
commodities, rather than just a few of them’ (Chatham 
House 2008: 2). High prices in agricultural markets are 
not uncommon, but increases across such a range of food 
commodities are.
The escalation in food prices had some well-docu-
mented impacts, notably a series of violent protests and 
demonstrations that were witnessed in different parts of 
the developing world, including the ‘tortilla riots’ in Mex-
ico. Some countries (e.g. Argentina) also imposed trade 
restrictions to limit the amount of food being exported 
to protect national food supply. The price spike affected 
households in developed nations such as the UK in less 
dramatic ways, via food inflation. Prices for oils and fats 
in the UK rose by 29 per cent in the year to July 2008, 
meat by 16.3 per cent, bread and cereals by 16 per cent, 
vegetables by 11.1 per cent and fruit by 10.7 per cent (Bar-
ling et al. 2008, quoted in House of Commons 2009). 
Although less dramatic, these impacts served to underline 
‘our global interdependency and demonstrated the politi-
cal and social importance of affordable food’ (Chatham 
House 2009: 5).
The factors that contributed to the increase in food 
prices at this time are widely reported and include poor 
harvests, the use of food crops for biofuels, especially 
maize in the USA, rising energy prices, which led to 
high prices for fertilizers and fuel, changes in demand 
for certain foods (e.g. growing demand for more meat 
in China), export bans and speculation (Jarosz 2009). 
There is still on-going debate about whether food price 
rises will be sustained longer term, or whether what 
was experienced in 2007 was merely a blip (see Gard-
ner 2013). Food prices have fallen again in international 
commodity markets, but they remain volatile. Industry 
analysts suggest higher and more volatile food prices are 
set to stay (von Braun 2009).
Addressing the consequences of higher food prices is 
only part of the challenge. Constraints on global food 
supply are also influenced by longer-term trends, notably 
changing global patterns in diet and world population 
pressures. Population expansion is a particularly signifi-
cant driver of the long-term increase in food demand, 
with predictions that the world may need to feed over 
nine billion people from 2050. Projections suggest that 
95 per cent of this growth will occur in the developing 
world. At the World Food Security Conference in Rome in 
June 2008, it was estimated that food production needed 
to increase by 50 per cent by 2030 and to double by 2050.
Undercutting all of this discussion is an increased aware-
ness of the risks posed by climate change and increasingly 

316    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
underpinning the response to the current ‘global food 
security crisis’. This is described by Godfray et al. 
(2010) as ‘sustainable intensification’. The essence 
of this idea is that we need to achieve higher yields 
from the same acreage without damaging the envi-
ronment. In a similar vein, the UK Government’s 
Chief Scientist, John Beddington (2010: 61), argues 
that we need ‘a new, “greener revolution”’ (original 
emphasis). Advocates of this approach claim that sci-
ence and technology have time and again provided 
huge increases in yield growth when required. Impor-
tant areas to focus upon in this context include, for 
example, crop improvement, smarter use of water 
and fertilizers, the introduction of novel non-chem-
ical approaches to crop protection, the reduction of 
post-harvest losses and more sustainable livestock 
and marine production. Projects and initiatives are 
also emerging to meet the challenge to produce more 
food (or they are at least marketed in this food crisis 
context). One example is the development of modern 
hydroponic schemes. A state-of-the-art version now 
exists in the UK, called Thanet Earth (see Spotlight 
box 15.4), and such schemes are well known in The 
Netherlands and California. Another highly contro-
versial example is the proposal to build the UK’s first 
‘super dairy’. Plans were originally submitted for an 
● Food security as minimizing risks in industrialized 
agricultural production in terms of the risk of ‘normal 
accidents’ and ‘intentional accidents’ associated with 
agri-terrorism.
These collective action frames are grounded in the 
US experience and identify the different perspectives 
and interests on one seemingly consensual social prob-
lem. It also distinguishes between relatively tame institu-
tional responses and much more critical viewpoints and 
positions. This resonates with earlier material in this 
chapter in which weaker and stronger variants of alter-
native food networks are identified as part of a critique 
of neoliberalism (Watts et al. 2005). Crucially, Mooney 
and Hunt (2009: 493) do more than simply identify a 
plurality of framings by locating ‘this process within an 
ordered, yet contentious, multi-organizational political 
field of differential power wielded by various insiders 
and outsiders’.
15.4.2 Three food security ‘action frames’
This sub-section outlines three illustrative action frames 
that are emerging outwith the US experience:
1.	 Sustainable intensification. There has been a 
strong science-oriented or techno-centric discourse 
Spotlight box 15.4
Is the future hydroponic? Thanet Earth
Hydroponic schemes are a well-established feature of 
the California and the Netherlands agro-foodscape. A 
state-of-the-art version also now exists in Kent, called 
‘Thanet Earth’. It is owned by a consortium of Dutch 
growers and Fresca, a fresh-produce agglomerate. 
The consortium bought 90 hectares of land and has 
assembled three gigantic glasshouses, with planning 
permission for another four.
In 2009, Thanet Earth’s first year in production, 2.5 
million tomatoes left the glasshouses for the sorting 
area in an average week and the cucumber and pep-
per harvests peaked at half a million and three-quarters 
of a million a week (Harding 2010). This amounts to 
about 2 per cent of UK demand and the target is to sup-
ply 4 per cent of all tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers 
consumed in the UK.
Thanet Earth is heralded as an example of low-­
carbon horticulture on a grand scale. As Hardy notes, it 
scores well in terms of certain facets of sustainability. In 
terms of water, for example, produce is grown on blocks 
of rock wool about a meter off the ground and surplus 
water drains into long trays underneath the blocks and 
from there to lagoons, along with rainwater off the 
roofs, to be pumped around again. Thanet Earth is also 
clever in terms of its energy strategy, using a system 
called combined heat and power. On other issues it is 
also virtuous – minimal pesticide use and preserving 
biodiversity – but it scores less well in terms of labour, 
with very few indigenous British workers among the 
workforce who harvest the crop, although such labour 
issues are not uncommon in other, smaller-scale, horti-
cultural enterprises.
So could Thanet Earth-like growing models poten-
tially bring Britain to self-sufficiency in ‘salad’? The 
paradox is that it is not just about growing more food; 
it is also about getting people to eat the right type and 
balance of foods. As Harding (2010: 7) puts it: ‘A larger 
query hanging over hydroponic growing in the UK is 
quite what it solves until we all start eating many more 
tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers.’

The scheme, including a revised proposal (for a 3,770-

continued opposition from the Environment Agency 
(the regulator managing UK freshwater systems), as 
well as animal welfare groups and local residents.
2.	 Waste. This example is about making better use of 
what we already have (i.e. we need to be less wasteful). 
There is growing realization that we are eating beyond 
our means and that food chain dependency on imports 
creates vulnerability. This approach is captured well 
in Stuart’s (2009: xxii) text, Waste, where he argues 
‘industrialized nations need to learn what it means to 
live in scarcity – because the appearance of infinite 
abundance is an illusion‘. The essence of his argument 
is that we can increase food supply and reduce envi-
ronmental consequences by reducing waste within the 
food supply chain. In the USA, for example, around 
50 per cent of all food is wasted. In Britain, we create 
up to 20 million tonnes of food waste per year. The 
Japanese dispose of food worth ¥11 trillion [US$101.6 
billion] annually. Food is treated as a ‘disposable com-
modity’ throughout the developed world (Stuart 2009: 
xvi). We waste food at all stages of the food chain, 
from production and harvesting through to post-pur-
chase by the consumer. Waste may arise due to poor 
handling, poor storage, cultural perceptions, retailer 
demands, consumer ignorance or sheer laziness. Stuart 
(2009: xix) argues that we can turn this wastefulness to 
our advantage in that ‘the world’s mountain of surplus 
food is currently an environmental liability – but it is 
also a great opportunity’. Efficiency measures could 
create savings and help the fight against hunger. Sal-
vaging food would also help tackle global warming. 
In Europe, for example, more than 30 per cent of 
Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions come from food. 
If food waste was halved, emissions would be reduced 
by 5 per cent or more. There are now a number of 
social movements, national and global campaigns and 
food chain initiatives emerging to promote awareness 
about reducing different forms of food waste, includ-
ing Feeding The 5000.
3.	 The urban foodscape. Burgeoning prices for basic food-
stuffs and concerns about the security and sustainabil-
ity of the agri-food system are also raising awareness 
of the pressures facing urban areas and their need to 
grow as well as consume food. For example, in a study 
of the evolution of food strategies in London and New 
York it is argued that both of these world cities are 
being forced to think anew about food security so that 
‘despite being highly developed sites of global capital-
ism, [they] have not managed to banish the spectre of 
hunger from their streets’ (Morgan and Sonnino 2010: 
222). Urban food security policy in both cities is focus-
ing on two key dimensions of the problem: food pro-
duction and food access. For the former, new planning 
dispensation for urban agriculture allows the city to 
feed itself from within (as in London) or from neigh-
bouring areas (as in New York). For the latter, both cit-
ies have used the school meal service as the main food 
access scheme for children, with New York actively 
promoting the consumption of fresh food in poor dis-
tricts via schemes like Green Cart.
The last of these three indicative examples articulates 
a wider definition and framing of food security beyond 
that conceived in the pages of agricultural trade journals 
and the sustainable intensification mantra (i.e. not just 
about availability of food but also concerned with access 
and utilization). As Mooney and Hunt (2009) suggest, 
these framings exist side-by-side as part of a multi-organ-
izational political field of differential power networks 
that constitutes food security.
15.5 Conclusion: the ethical 
foodscape
This chapter has reviewed the changing nature of food 
production, especially in the context of developed mar-
ket economies. The important contributions that geog-
raphers have made to debates concerning the long-term 
sustainability of agri-food systems have been highlighted. 
Such a broad assessment is always partial in its cover-
age, but it shows how geographers have examined differ-
ent systems of food production in different spatial and 
temporal contexts. Different types of production system 
have attracted particular research attention at certain 
times. A good deal of the research in the late 1970s, 1980s 
and early 1990s examined industrial agriculture and the 
industrialization of the food system. The capitalist mode 
of production still prevails and large agri-food compa-
nies and corporate retailers have developed considerable 
power and effectively exert control over the entire food 
supply system. Geographers and others are continuing 
to provide valuable insights into these processes, as evi-
denced through the salmon farming studies in Chile and 
Friedberg’s (2014) recent work on the technopolitics of 
Life Cycle Assessment footprints. Techniques like foot-
printing are increasingly used by food corporations as 
new forms of governance that demonstrate and at the 
same time construct how sustainability is defined.
Despite these efforts, there is dissatisfaction with the 
performance of the food system. Since the late-1990s, 
much attention has been placed on alternative and local 

318    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
food systems. Farmers and other producers have devel-
oped ‘alternative’ forms of agriculture, based on ter-
ritorial association and direct consumer contact, and 
geographers continue to actively examine these modes 
of production. In some cases, these systems of provision 
directly challenge ‘mainstream’ forms of food provision. 
They represent ways of growing and procuring food that 
are different in terms of scale and operation. Debates 
about food security are also attracting renewed attention 
from food policy analysts, geographers and other agri-
food researchers. This threat to ‘global food security’ is 
not new and many food analysts have in fact predicted it 
for some time. Crucially, the new emphasis is forcing a 
re-think about the way we produce food, where and how 
we produce food, and how we value food. Much of this 
is still to be worked out, but we are already seeing how 
the ‘crisis’ is forcing different actors in the foodscape to 
reposition their alliances (Maye and Kirwan 2013).
This debate is also forcing us to re-conceptualize food 
systems and the way in which we assess whether they 
are a sustainable and ethical way of food provisioning. 
As Hinrichs (2014: 143) argues, the present context of 
intertwined and intensifying economic, environmental 
and climate change challenges and crises means we must 
enlarge our thinking about food systems change and sus-
tainability transitions. McMichael (2009) argues that the 
food regime concept is a useful way to do this because it 
not only reveals the structured moments and transitions 
in the history of capitalist food relations, but also of capi-
talism itself (see also Sage 2013). In these terms the ‘world 
food crisis’ is thus a consequence of industrial capital-
ism’s long-term over-dependence on fossil fuel, combined 
with the inflation-producing effects of biofuels offsets, 
financial speculation activities, and the concentration 
and centralization practices of agribusiness capital.
Another example relates to ‘ethical foodscapes’, where 
‘morality is a key and growing currency in the provision-
ing of food in much of the post-industrial North and 
beyond’ (Goodman et al. 2010: 1783). While all food has 
ethical implications, some food has taken on the con-
notation of being, often in quite particular ways, more 
ethical. This applies particularly to foods labelled as 
alternative. Many of these more ethical foods are equally 
a part of conventional food systems and many foods 
that we label ‘conventional’ or ‘ordinary’ have their own 
implicit moralities and ethical relationships and mean-
ings so that ‘the ethics of ethical foodscapes can thus be 
ambiguous, slippery and consist of a number of inter-
woven layers’ (Goodman et al. 2010: 1783). This means 
that we need to break down dualistic characterizations 
of ‘alternative’ foods as uniquely ethical and conven-
tional foods as unethical. We also need greater critical 
analysis of our assessments of ‘goodness’ and ‘badness’, 
whether in terms of practical indicators, material prac-
tices or acceptable food politics. The current ‘food crisis’ 
offers an excellent opportunity to carry out closer food 
system examinations of what constitutes ‘goodness’ and 
‘badness’. How and where should we grow food? Do we 
want our cities to be places where we grow (more) food? 
Should we challenge methods of growing food that pro-
mote so-called ‘sustainable intensification’? What about 
the role of local food systems in the future?
Finally, new debates about ‘sustainable diets’ (i.e. how 
diets impact and could be changed to improve the sus-
tainability of the planet) and the emergence of ‘less meat 
initiatives’ (Morris et al. 2014) raise significant socio-eco-
nomic and ethical questions, including their potential to 
contribute to a transition towards more sustainable forms 
of meat production, provisioning and eating. As a more 
general concluding point, it is suggested that an emphasis 
on food ethics in a context of growing uncertainty about 
food supplies is a highly fruitful means by which to exam-
ine food production geographies. A better understand-
ing of food production geographies and capacities will 
also help to ameliorate social and ecological inequalities. 
The material presented in this chapter suggests the era of 
endless food may be winding down. Our habits will have 
to change because, as the food writer Felicity Lawrence 
(2008; quoted in Harding 2010: 3) puts it, ‘they simply 
cannot go on. We are now entering a period of rapid tran-
sition’. Human geographers are well placed to provide 
analytical insight into transitions to food sustainability.

Learning outcomes
After reading this chapter, you should have:
● An understanding of the importance of food 
to modern economies and societies and what 
is meant by a food chain and its application in 
different contexts.
● An awareness of how and why the agri-food system 
has become globalized – especially the dominance 
and spatially uneven penetration by transnational 
agribusinesses.

commodity food production in some parts of the 
developing world and the reasons why this has 
happened.

including some of the main reasons why they have 
arisen, how they are conceptualized and case study 
examples to explain their diverse character.
● An appreciation of recent debates about food 
security and ethics and a sense of how these 
issues disturb and unsettle notions of ‘goodness’ 
and ‘badness’ in relation to food production and 
provisioning more generally.

PRODUCTION NETWORKS 
 Chapter 16 

322    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
16.1 Engaging with global 
production networks
Imagine the scene. We could be in San Francisco, 
­Shanghai, Sheffield, Singapore or Sydney, or many other 
places besides. A student – having just been to a lecture 
and en route to her evening job in a restaurant – stops for 
a drink in a café. After choosing from the extensive menu 
of coffee options, she takes a window seat and boots up 
her laptop computer, instantly connecting to the free 
wifi the café offers for its customers. Essay assignment 
in hand, the student starts surfing the Internet, looking 
for the reading materials and background information 
she will need. Every so often, she pauses, takes a sip of 
­coffee – an iced caffè mocha or some such like – and gazes 
out at the street . . . 
On the one hand, what is being described here is a unique 
consumption event, an individual lost in her thoughts as 
she consumes her coffee and uses her laptop at a particular 
time and in a particular place (see ­Chapter 19). And yet, 
on the other hand, the two central non-human artefacts in 
this particular story – the coffee and the ­laptop – may have 
remarkably similar economic geographies and histories, 
wherever the event is taking place.
For example, the coffee bar in question might be a 
branch of Starbucks, with annual revenues of US$16.4 
billion making it the world’s largest coffeehouse chain, 
serving millions of customers every day in some 20,500 
cafés across more than 60 countries (as of January 2015). 
It is one of many other similar chains offering their own 
standardized take on the continental European coffee 
house experience: for example, Caffè Nero, Costa Coffee 
or Coffee Republic in the United Kingdom; Caribou Coffee 
or Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf in the United States; Barista 
or Café Coffee Day in India; and Gloria Jean’s or Dome 
in Australia. There is a strong chance that the ­coffee beans 
were roasted and processed by one of just ten American 
and European firms – a mixture of large ­transnational 
corporations such as Nestlé, Mondelez and D.E. Mas-
ter Blenders 1753, and a few big coffee roasters such as 
Smucker’s, Strauss, Starbucks and Tchibo – which handle 
some 40 per cent of the world’s coffee each year. Equally, 
the laptop used by our student may well be made by either 
Hewlett Packard (HP) or Lenovo, which between them, at 
the end of 2014, accounted for 39 per cent of the global 
market share. Indeed, just five companies – HP, Dell, and 
Apple (US), Lenovo (China), and Acer (Taiwan) – account 
for almost 70 per cent of laptop sales worldwide.
Why are these observations interesting? In short, 
because both the cup of coffee being consumed and the 
laptop being used are the end result of far-reaching global 
production networks, which are in turn ­dominated by 
powerful corporate interests of various kinds. Almost 
all the commodities that we consume have complicated 
histories and geographies and yet, as a system, capital-
ism seems to conceal these. The purchase of commodities 
such as coffee or computers with money serves to discon-
nect producers and consumers, meaning many consumers 
are unaware of the nature of the ­production system that 
has enabled those commodities to be available to them. 
This poses profound challenges to both conscientious 
consumers actively curious about the ­history of the com-
modities they consume (see Chapter 19), and economic 
geographers who want to understand connections and 
interdependencies within the global economy. In reality, 
even drinking just one cup of coffee links the consumer – 
albeit unknowingly in most cases – to hundreds of thou-
sands of workers involved directly or indirectly in its 
production through complex global webs of connections.

then consumes it. Consumption, in turn, is not just a 
single act of purchase, but an ongoing process that may 
include maintenance, repair, waste disposal, recycling and 
the like. This basic model holds whether it is a physical 
good – such as a television or bicycle – being produced, 
or a service such as a haircut or insurance policy, with 
the difference coming in the relative balance of tangi-
ble and intangible elements in the production chain (see 
­Chapter 17). While simple chains can be thought of in 
linear terms, in reality (as Figure 16.1 shows) they are 
enmeshed within much wider networks of relationships 
involving a broad range of other functions that are nec-
essary for economic activities to take place: for example, 
research and development, market research, technologi-
cal inputs, logistics services, advertising, legal services, 
accounting, personnel management, software, security 
and so on. In turn, these inter-firm relations are embed-
ded in broader financial and regulatory systems that may 
bring non-firm entities such as the state and its many 
institutions into view. In this chapter we use the term pro-
duction network to refer to the full mesh of relationships 
that lies behind any economic activity.
Production networks vary greatly in their complexity. 
At one end of the scale is the single farmer who grows 
This chapter is therefore about how we, as economic 
geographers, can explore and understand the inherent 
variability of global production networks. In what fol-
lows, we will look in turn at four generic dimensions of 
all global production networks, namely their organiza-
tion, geography, power relations or ‘governance’, and 
institutional context. We will use the contrasting exam-
ples of the coffee and laptop global production networks 
as illustrations of these various dimensions. In the final 
section of the chapter we will look at ongoing attempts 
to reshape production networks through the implementa-
tion of different kinds of standards and codes of conduct.
16.2 Production chains, 
production networks . . . 
Every economic activity can be thought of as a produc-
tion chain – a linked series of value-adding activities 
(see Figure 16.1). In very simple terms, material and non-
material inputs are combined and transformed through 
some kind of production process, leading to a new good 
or service that needs to be delivered to the customer who

324    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
In sum, every production network constitutes a unique 
constellation of activities performed via complex com-
binations of internal and external network connections. 
The first step in understanding any production system, 
therefore, is to map out the key participants and the 
nature of the relationships that connect them.
The coffee production network is relatively straight-
forward and is represented schematically in Figure 16.2. 
Even so, coffee travels a long way and changes hands sev-
eral times on the journey from bean to cup. The major 
participants in the network are depicted by boxes, and 
the transactions that move coffee in its different forms 
between participants are shown by arrows. Coffee flows 
through the network from the growers, who in effect 
begin the system, to the consumers who represent the 
end point. Coffee – which comes in two main types, Ara-
bica and Robusta – is generally grown on small farms or 
estates in the tropical countries. Once basic processing 
has extracted the ‘green’ coffee beans from picked coffee 
cherries, they will pass in 60-kg bags from an exporter 
to a consuming country importer, trader or broker, then 
on to a roaster or instant coffee manufacturer, and then 
finally to a consumer via either a supermarket shelf or 
café of some kind. These relationships are essentially 
‘arms-length’ market connections, with prices being 
set by international commodity markets such as the 
New York Board of Trade (Arabica) and the London 
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange 
(Robusta). We will see later, however, how the roles of 
these various participants have evolved over time.
In contrast, laptop computers are the outcome of a 
much more complicated production network that brings 
together hundreds of different components into the fin-
ished product. It is estimated, for example, that a laptop 
may contain around 2,200 separate parts (Dedrick et al. 
2010). The personal computer (PC) industry is therefore 
a complex network of firms involved in a wide range of 
different industry segments – from microprocessors and 
other electronic components to applications and systems 
software providers – and covering a wide range of activi-
ties: R&D and design, manufacturing, assembly, logistics, 
distribution, sales, marketing, service and support. How 
these various functions are split between different compa-
nies has changed over time. Historically in the computer 
industry, vertically integrated giants such as IBM, HP and 
Siemens operated in all the industry segments and carried 
out the key functions of product innovation, manufactur-
ing and customer relations internally.
Since the advent of the PC, however, a much more 
complex ‘tiered’ network has evolved in which most 
companies concentrate on one particular market seg-
ment, for example, assembling PCs, or making circuit 
one particular kind of vegetable and transports it to a 
local market for sale at harvest time. Conversely, a com-
plicated manufactured product such as a car mobilizes a 
wide range of skills and technologies to bring together 
the thousands of components that comprise the finished 
product. The next step is to think about who undertakes 
the different activities in a given production network. 
Hypothetically, every single function might be carried out 
by one huge firm, which would coordinate the production 
network through its internal management hierarchy (a 
vertically integrated system). Equally, every single func-
tion might be undertaken by separate firms, meaning 
that the production network would take the form of a 
series of external, inter-firm relationships (a vertically 
disintegrated system). In reality, all production networks 
fall somewhere between these extremes. In a context of 
increased global competition, however, the dominant 
trend has been for firms in many sectors to focus on their 
core activity or ‘competency’, while seeking non-core 
inputs via external relationships. For some commenta-
tors, this trend is part of a broader shift from Fordist to 
more flexible post-Fordist production systems.
These increasingly important external networks can 
take on many forms:
● Markets: some inputs – usually of low value and 
standardized – will simply be purchased by firms on 
the open market. In this case, there is no long-term 
relationship between the two parties and firms can 
readily switch between suppliers.
● Subcontracting: this involves firms buying inputs that 
have been made, under contract, to meet their own 
specific requirements. The stability of the relation-
ship will vary according to the formality and length 
of the contract. Subcontracting may involve the entire 
manufacture of a particular good or service, known 
as commercial subcontracting, or it may take the form 
of a firm buying in particular inputs that it does not 
have the skills or capacity to produce cost-effectively 
‘in-house’– industrial subcontracting.
● Strategic alliances/joint ventures: this is where firms 
come together to create a new corporate entity in 
order to undertake a particular task, for example 
costly joint research. In many other respects the par-
ticipating firms may still remain competitors.
● Franchising and licensing: here, firms allow a company 
(the franchisee or licensee) to sell their product or ser-
vice in a particular territory under given terms and 
conditions, and in return for a set fee. Franchising is 
very common in the service sector (including fast food, 
retailing, coffee shops, etc.), allowing rapid geographi-
cal expansion.

relations, ‘outsourcing’ the remainder of the production 
process to other firms. This system reflects the nature of 
the PC as a standardized product assembled from compo-
nents that can be produced in a wide variety of locations 
by a broad range of firms. Only limited value is added 
by assembling a PC: in most cases PC firms add value 
through customer relationships, either directly through 
their own direct sales and service relationships (e.g. help 
desks, repairs, etc.) or indirectly through their branding, 
marketing and quality assurance practices. They also 
extract value from the network through coordinating the 
logistics operations that turn components into finished 
products on customer doorsteps. As Curry and Kenney 
(2004: 114) suggest, ‘a PC assembler is, in many ways, 
more a logistics coordinator than a manufacturer’.
Most laptop assembly operations, therefore, are sub-
contracted to contract manufacturers (CM), and increas-
ingly, to a particular form of subcontractor known as 
the original design manufacturer (ODM) who will also 
contribute to the design process. In the case of contract 
manufacturers, a branded PC firm is likely to employ 
its own, on-the-ground design and development teams 
throughout the production process to supervise sub-
contractors: this is the model preferred by Toshiba and 
Lenovo (the leading Chinese manufacturer), for example. 
With an ODM, however, the PC maker may take primary 
responsibility for design, but it will then pass a product 
specification on to the ODM for final development and 
manufacturing; HP and Apple operate in this way and

tiers of firms and assemblers spread across East and 
South-east Asia. It is to these complex, on-the-ground 
geographies of production networks that we now turn.

Geographies of production 
networks: spatial divisions of 
labour
It goes without saying, of course, that the production 
networks described above do not exist on the head of a 
pin, but rather connect together, and indeed partly con-
stitute, real places within the global economy. Every pro-
duction network requires a spatial division of labour, 
this is currently the most common model in the industry. 
In yet another model, smaller PC vendors without the 
scale to undertake their own design activity may simply 
purchase generic ‘off-the-shelf’ products from ODMs to 
be labelled and sold under their own name. Backwards 
relationships from branded PC firms to ODMs may also 
extend forwards to the customer through the delivery and 
servicing of laptops on behalf of PC vendors. Overall, 
the result is a highly responsive and efficient production 
system in which an order via a branded PC company’s 
website can be dispatched by an ODM within 48 hours.
It is important to bear in mind that Figure 16.3 only 
provides a limited window on what is, in reality, a highly 
complex network connecting together hundreds of firms 
and tens of thousands of workers. For example, the hard 
disk drive industry (see ‘Core Tier 3 suppliers’ box in

Massey’s conceptual apparatus is still extremely 
­powerful today, although her study – which was pri-
marily about intra-firm and intra-national divisions of 
labour – needs to be extended in two important ways. 
First, as we have already noted, spatial divisions of 
labour can be constructed through combinations of 
intra-firm (internal), and increasingly, inter-firm (exter-
nal) networks. Second, we need to apply these ideas at 
the international scale. One of the defining character-
istics of the world economy over the past two to three 
decades has been the dramatic increase in the number 
of transnational corporations (TNCs) organizing their 
spatial divisions of labour at the international scale. It 
is now difficult to think of a production network that 
does not have at least some international elements, even 
if it is just seen in the sourcing of one or two inputs, 
or a limited export market for the final good/service. 
Global production networks, as we will call them here, 
have become one of the most important organizational 
features of the contemporary global economy. Spotlight 
box 16.1 considers different attempts to conceptualize 
the nature of international divisions of labour at differ-
ent points in the global economy’s evolution.
We can make three further arguments about the geog-
raphies of global production networks:
● First, their geographical complexity is increasing, ena-
bled by a range of developments in transport, com-
munication and process technologies. As we shall see 
shortly, the assembly of a laptop requires components 
manufactured at places all across East Asia.
which refers to the way in which certain elements of the 
production process are concentrated in particular places. 
The concept of the spatial division of labour is elucidated 
particularly well by Massey (1984) who explored how these 
spatial variations are both created and exploited by the 
ongoing restructuring of capitalist firms in their pursuit 
of profit. After examining the spatial restructuring of the 
UK economy in the 1960s and 1970s, her key argument 
was that under conditions of increased global competition, 
corporations were increasingly looking to separate spa-
tially the control functions performed by managerial work-
ers from the execution functions undertaken by manual 
workers. In its most simple form, low-skilled manual tasks 
were tending to locate in peripheral areas, while manage-
rial and R&D tasks were concentrating in core cities and 
their surrounding regions. Massey argued that, over time, 
different layers of investment fan out across the economic 
landscape, redefining the nature of relationships between 
places as they gain or lose different kinds of activities.
Different spatial divisions of labour arise from varia-
tions in corporate structures which, at a simple level, can 
be divided into cloning and part-process structures. In 
the cloning structure, the production apparatus is simply 
replicated in different localities, with ultimate control 
residing at a headquarters, usually sited in the firm’s ini-
tial place of origin. In the part-process format, there is a 
technical division of labour between branch plants, with 
components being made in one location and passed on 
to another for final assembly. The different stages of the 
production process will have varying requirements, and 
hence tend towards different kinds of location.
Spotlight box 16.1
Conceptualizing global divisions 
of labour?
It is helpful to distinguish between three separate 
attempts to conceptualize international spatial divisions 
of labour, which broadly coincide with different phases 
of development of the global economy.
● First, it is possible to identify the traditional interna-
tional division of labour (IDL) that took shape by 
the nineteenth century and prevailed largely unal-
tered until the 1950s. The IDL essentially depicted 
a trading system – shaped initially by global trading 
empires, and later by the rise of the USA as an 
economic power – in which the developing world 
or ‘periphery’ was largely relegated to providing 
raw materials and agricultural plantation products 
(e.g. coffee from Brazil, copper from Chile, gold 
and diamonds from South Africa) for the industri-
alized economies of the ‘core’ (Western Europe 
and the USA). High-value manufactured goods 
were exchanged between the industrialized coun-
tries, and some were exported back to developing 
countries.
● Second, from the 1960s onwards, a new inter-
national division of labour (NIDL) started to 
emerge in which European, North American and 
Japanese TNCs created labour-intensive export 
platforms in so-called ‘newly industrializing econo-
mies’ (NIEs) (especially in East Asia and, to a 
lesser extent, Latin America) in response to falling 
profit rates in the core countries. Crucially, the sys-
tem depended on new technologies that allowed 
➜

328    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
production fragmentation, thereby creating tasks 
that could use, often young and female, semi-skilled 
or unskilled workers in the periphery. Two kinds of 
technology were important: process technologies 
that allowed the subdivision of the manufacturing 
process into simple and self-contained tasks, and 
transportation technologies such as jet aircraft and 
containerized shipping that allowed the efficient 
shipment of both components and finished goods.
● Third, it has become clear that in recent decades a 
new global division of  labour has emerged that is 
far more complex than the system depicted in the 
NIDL model, which does not capture, for example: 
how the range of NIE economies has broadened 
and deepened considerably, particularly in Asia; 
increasing investment into NIEs, such as China and 
India, to access their domestic markets; significant 
outward investment by NIE transnational corpora-
tions, e.g. from South Korean giants such as LG 
and Samsung; continued high levels of investment 
between developed economies and the emergence 
of complex international divisions of labour in the 
service sector. The contemporary global economy 
is clearly not characterized by one single type of 
IDL but rather many different forms. Rather than 
disappearing, the traditional IDL and the NIDL 
remain important in a range of industries (e.g. natu-
ral resources and clothing/toys, respectively) and 
have subsequently been overlain by, and have inter-
acted with, newer and more complex international 
divisions of labour. For more on these debates, see 
Coe (2011).
➜
● Second, the geographic configurations of global pro-
duction networks are becoming more dynamic and 
liable to rapid change. This flexibility arises, first, from 
the use of certain ‘space-shrinking’ information and 
communication technologies and, second, from organ-
izational forms that enable the fast spatial switching 
of productive capacity (Dicken 2015). In particular, 
the increased use of subcontracting and strategic alli-
ance relationships (noted above) allows firms to switch 
contracts between different firms and places without 
incurring the costs of moving production themselves.
● Third, we need to connect these ideas about the geo-
graphical extensiveness and complexity of global produc-
tion networks with notions concerning the geographical 
clustering of economic activity. Not all the connections 
within the system can be ‘stretched out’ across the global 
economy; some interactions will need to take place within 
the same locality because of the sheer intensity of trans-
actions or because of the importance of place-specific 
knowledge to the activity concerned. From this perspec-
tive, global production networks need to be seen as the 
organizational forms that connect clusters together.
Let us now move on to apply these ideas to our two 
products. The global map of coffee production and con-
sumption is not very complicated. Growing coffee involves 
several million farmers, who ultimately support the con-
sumption of an estimated 2 billion cups of coffee every 
day. The vast majority of coffee production takes place in 
tropical countries while most of the consumption occurs 
in the wealthy markets of North America, Western Europe 
and East Asia. Some 8.5 ­million tonnes of coffee were pro-
duced in 2014, of which 6.7 million tonnes, or nearly 80 per 
cent, were exported. Although over 50 countries currently 
produce coffee, the top 12 exporters account for more than 
90 per cent of the global trade (Figure 16.4). The geography 
of production is shaped by the ecology of the coffee plant 
which requires a consistently warm and wet climate, mak-
ing it most suitable for growing in tropical highland areas. 
The production geography is not static, however. Most 
notably, exports of Robusta coffee grown in the central 
highlands of Vietnam have expanded dramatically over the 
last two decades – rising from just 100,000 tonnes in 1990 
to 1.3 million tonnes by 2012 and remaining at or around 
that level ever since – creating an over-supply in the global 
market and putting severe downward pressure on prices. As 
a result, coffee growing is an increasingly marginal practice 
for growers across Central and Latin America and Africa. 
The consumption of coffee has a long history linked to 
colonial expansion by Europeans, which served to both 
spread the taste for coffee, particularly from the sixteenth 
century onwards, and spread coffee ­cultivation from its 
supposed origins in present-day Ethiopia to the band of 
tropical countries shown in ­Figure 16.4 (Topik 2009). The 
key commodity markets and international traders and 
roasters are, however, all based in the USA and Europe 
(see Figure 16.2).
Turning to the geography of the laptop production net-
work, the majority of the world’s laptops are produced by 
Taiwanese firms. All branded manufacturers – such as HP, 
Acer, Apple and Toshiba – rely on Taiwanese ODM firms 
for manufacturing and product development. In 1998, Tai-
wanese companies accounted for 40 per cent of a world 
market of 15 million units; this rose to 72 per cent of the 
46 million laptops produced in 2004, and 94 per cent of the 
195 million laptops produced in 2011. By the end of 2014, 
the top five Taiwanese manufacturers (see Table 16.1) 
alone produced 34.6 million (or 75 per cent) of the 46 mil-
lion laptops shipped worldwide that quarter. Production 
is also growing faster than the PC market as a whole; in 

Chapter 16  The geographies of global production networks    329
However, these geographies are also far from static. 
­Taiwanese electronics firms have been moving production 
‘offshore’ – to South-east Asia, Europe and, most impor-
tantly, China – since the early 1990s. There are now two 
key PC clusters in China: the Shenzhen area of Guang-
dong province (in the south of the country), specializing 
in desktop machines, and the Shanghai/Suzhou/Yangtze 
River delta area, home to the laptop PC industry (see 
Figure 16.5). Before 2001, the Taiwanese government pro-
hibited its laptop manufacturers from undertaking final 
assembly in China. When this restriction was lifted, the 
ODMs moved collectively, and incredibly rapidly, to the 
Shanghai area: in 2001 only 5 per cent of Taiwanese laptops 
were produced in China but by 2004 the figure had shot 
up to 80 per cent, and it is now almost 100 per cent. The 
2005, one in three PCs sold globally was a laptop, while 
by 2014 nearly six in ten PCs were laptops. The industry 
can change incredibly rapidly, however, with both desktop 
and laptop PC shipment levels under threat of being over-
taken by tablet devices by 2015, the production of which 
has mushroomed since the release of the first iPad in 2010. 
As Table 16.1 suggests, each leading laptop vendor tends to 
contract with two or three Taiwanese firms, arrangements 
which in the cases of HP and Apple account for upwards 
of 90 per cent of their total global laptop production; for 
Japanese companies such as Sony, Sharp and Toshiba, the 
proportion tends to be somewhat lower (50–70 per cent). 
Taipei – and the nearby region of Hsinchu where many 
Taiwanese high-tech firms are based – is therefore a critical 
node in the laptop production network.

lower costs of land, labour and facilities on the mainland 
allowed the firms to build giant factories, expand output 
and reduce costs through scale economies. The produc-
tion levels involved are quite staggering: in 2014 the lead-
ing Taiwanese producer Quanta was manufacturing just 
under 4 million laptops per month at its Chinese plants. 
The offices of these firms in Taiwan remain responsible 
for product development, technology research, materials 
procurement, financial management and marketing (Sax-
enian 2006). In this way, a new intra-firm spatial division 
of labour is added to the system depicted in Figure 16.3.
Many Taiwanese component suppliers had already relo-
cated to the region by 2001, and now almost all the parts 
needed to make a laptop are manufactured in the Suzhou 
area. Initially, the highest-value components such as the 
central processor, hard drive and displays continued to be 
made overseas by Japanese, Korean and US companies,

but over time many firms such as the US hard disk drive 
manufacturer Seagate and chip firm AMD have themselves 
established production facilities in the Shanghai region. 
Moving the entire supply chain to the Shanghai region in 
this way allowed the Taiwanese firms to overcome deficien-
cies in the Chinese logistics and distribution sectors. The 
scale of the undertaking should not be underestimated: 
by 2005 some 3,300 Taiwanese firms had already invested 
US$26 billion in Suzhou alone. Several of the transnational 
computer brand manufacturers (e.g. Toshiba, Samsung 
and Sony) also have bases in the region.
More recent developments suggest that these geogra-
phies are once again in flux, driven both by rising costs 
in the coastal provinces and strong growth in the Chinese 
domestic market for IT products and services of all kinds. 
In line with many other kinds of manufacturing activities 
in China, since 2010 significant levels of PC production 
have started to move to inland provinces. In particular, 
the massive inland city of Chongqing in Sichuan province 
(see Figure 16.5) has rapidly become an important site of 
PC manufacturing involving both branded PC firms and 
Taiwanese ODMs. In 2010, for instance, HP and the Tai-
wanese motherboard company Foxconn jointly opened 
two facilities in the city capable of manufacturing 20 mil-
lion laptops a year. The companies were attracted by the 
low labour, land and logistics costs as well as the city’s 
free trade zone. They were also able to benefit from a dis-
counted corporate tax rate of 15 per cent (down from the 
usual 25 per cent), while the city authorities also prom-
ised to extend the second runway of the local airport to 
meet HP’s logistical requirements. Quanta and Inventec 
have likewise established manufacturing bases in the city. 
As these trends continue, the geography of global laptop 
construction is once again being reworked.
While the laptop global production network has a 
relatively concentrated geography around the key nodes 
of Taipei/Hsinchu and Shanghai-Suzhou, the PC indus-
try generally has a somewhat more disparate geography. 
We can use the case of Dell as an example. There are 
three distinctive elements to Dell’s business model. First, 
the company only sells direct to its customers, bypassing 
almost entirely distributors, resellers, and retailers (see 
Figure 16.3). Second, unlike some PC manufacturers, Dell 
chooses to undertake a significant proportion of the final 
assembly of both desktop and laptop computers itself, 
allowing customers to specify the components included in 
a particular product line (a process that can be thought of 
as ‘mass customization’). The proportion of final assem-
bly has been declining over time due to competitive pres-
sures, however, with some laptops now made entirely 
by ODMs and some arriving in Dell’s factories semi-
assembled (the so-called ‘two-touch’ approach).Third, it 
has aggressively used the Internet to establish not only 
its system of direct sales, but also the procurement and 
assembly operations, thereby dramatically reducing its 
inventory of components. Figure 16.6 illustrates how Dell 
services its global market by using a series of regional 
production and service clusters (Fields 2004). Such clus-
ters are an integral part of the global space economy (see 
Spotlight box 16.2).

Spotlight box 16.2
Types of clusters in the global economy
There is a wide variety of different kinds of clusters in 
the global economy, created through different historical 
processes, and bound together by varying combinations 
of both traded and untraded interdependencies. Traded 
interdependencies are created by firms co-locating in a 
cluster alongside suppliers, partners and customers with 
which they have formal trading relationships. Untraded 
interdependencies are the less tangible benefits of being 
located in the same place, for example the emergence 
of a particular pool of specialized workers. In particular, 
clusters can facilitate patterns of intense and ongoing 
face-to-face communication – and thereby transfers of 
important forms of intangible knowledge – between peo-
ple working in the same or closely related industries.
We can think of at least eight significant types, each 
performing different roles within the global system:
1.	 Labour intensive craft production clusters. These 
are often found in industries such as clothing where 
firms are involved in tight subcontracting networks 
and often use high levels of immigrant labour and 
homeworkers. Examples include the garment pro-
duction districts of Los Angeles, New York and Paris.
2.	 Design intensive craft production clusters. These 
refer to dense agglomerations of small- and medium-
sized firms specializing in a particular aspect of 
the high-quality production of a good or service. 
­Examples include the renowned towns and districts 
of the Third Italy including Prato (textiles), Santa 
Croce (leather goods) and Sassuolo (ceramics).
3.	 High-technology innovative clusters. These 
clusters tend to have a large base of innovative 
small- and medium-sized firms and flexible, highly 
skilled labour markets in sectors such as computer 
software and biotechnology. Examples include 
Silicon Valley in the USA and Cambridge, United 
Kingdom.
4.	 Flexible production hub-and-spoke clusters. In these 
clusters, a single large firm, or small group of large 
firms, buys components from an extensive range 
of local suppliers to make products for markets 
­external to the cluster. Examples include Boeing in 
Seattle, USA, and Toyota in Toyota City, Japan.
5.	 Production satellite clusters. These clusters 
­represent congregations of externally owned 
­production facilities. These range from relatively 
basic assembly activity, through to more advanced 
plants with research capacity. Examples are to 
be found across the export processing zones 
(ePZs) of the developing world – the Shanghai 
­laptop ­cluster would also fall into this category.
6.	 Business service clusters. Business services 
­activities such as financial services, advertising, 
law, accountancy are concentrated in leading cities – 
such as New York, London and Tokyo – and their 
hinterlands.
7.	 State-anchored clusters. Some clusters have 
­developed because of the location of government 
facilities such as universities, defence industry 
research establishments, prisons, or government 
offices. Examples include agglomerations that have 
developed because of government research invest-
ment (Colorado Springs, USA; Taejon, South Korea) 
and universities (Oxford/Cambridge, United Kingdom).
8.	 Consumption clusters. There are also strong 
­propensities to cluster – often in central urban 
areas – in a wide variety of consumer service 
­activities including retailers, bars and restaurants, 
and cultural, leisure and tourism facilities.
16.4 The governance of production 
networks
So far we have exemplified the various actors within 
production networks, the functions that they undertake, 
and where they are located. The next step is to explain 
how such production networks function, and more spe-
cifically, the way in which some firms use their power 
over other firms to control or ‘drive’ the overall system. 
These ‘lead’ firms are able to define which other firms 
can join the network, the roles they perform, and the 
financial and technological conditions under which they 
perform those roles – despite not directly owning them. 
This shaping of global production networks by power-
ful corporations through inter-firm relations is known 
as governance.
Governance can take different forms. A useful 
­starting point is the distinction between networks that 
are ­producer-driven and those that are buyer-driven 

Chapter 16  The geographies of global production networks    333
of leading TNCs, and manifests itself in the ability to 
exert control over ‘backward’ linkages to raw material 
and component suppliers, and ‘forward’ linkages with 
distributors and retailers. High levels of profits are 
secured through the scale and volume of production in 
combination with the ability to drive technological devel-
opments within the production system. The automobile 
(Gereffi 1994; see Figure 16.7 and Table 16.2). Producer-
driven networks tend to be found in sectors where large 
­industrial corporations play the central role in controlling 
the production system, for example in capital- and tech-
nology-intensive industries such as aircraft, automobile 
and semiconductor manufacturing. Power in these net-
works is exercised through the headquarters operations

network – and indeed the constituent relationships 
within it – may change over time because of a wide range 
of factors, both internal and external to the system. In 
particular, firms and/or particular regions may seek to 
improve their position within the global production net-
work through pursuing upgrading strategies.
At first glance, comparing coffee and laptops would 
seem to provide a nice contrast between buyer- and pro-
ducer-driven networks. The coffee network is ‘clearly 
buyer-driven and coffee roasters play the lead role in 
determining the functional division of labour along the 
chain. In other words, roasters define the key terms of 
participation directly for their immediate suppliers and 
indirectly for other actors further upstream’ (Gibbon and 
Ponte 2005: 83). Roasters capture about 30 per cent of the 
value that is added in the coffee production network, but 
retailers (22 per cent) and international traders – such 
as Neumann and Volcafe – also do well (8 per cent). 
The result is that at least 60 per cent of the economic 
value derived from coffee goes to developed country 
firms, although some estimates put the figure as high as  
80 per cent (Fitter and Kaplinsky 2001). The domination 
by these actors is in large part a simple story of con-
centrated market power and economies of scale: the top 
four international coffee traders account for 40 per cent 
of the global trade; as noted in the introduction to this 
chapter, the top ten roasters handle about 40 per cent of 
the world’s coffee; and the top 30 global grocery retailers 
account for about one-third of global coffee sales. Roast-
ers, for example, reap the economic benefits of buying the 
beans in bulk and having captive suppliers that depend 
on their purchases. Even so, the coffee network is not 
as buyer-driven as networks driven directly by supermar-
ket chains (e.g. fresh fruit and vegetables) or by retailers 
and branded marketers (e.g. clothing and footwear). To a 
degree, the strong coffee roasters/brands are able to coun-
teract the huge buying power of the retailers, meaning 
that influence is shared. Ideal-type buyer- and producer-
driven chains, then, should perhaps be seen as the ends of 
a spectrum rather than discrete categories.
Typically, as noted in Table 16.2, the computer indus-
try has been seen as a capital-intensive producer-driven 
network dominated by vertically integrated giants such 
as IBM. However, the computer industry has changed 
beyond recognition over the past 25 years as the PC has 
increasingly become a mass-market standardized prod-
uct. The branded PC companies continue to drive the 
global production network, taking the decisions that 
drive the whole system and coordinating the activities 
of the other main players. But their role has changed 
over time. Leading manufacturers like HP and Apple 
have increasingly focused on final assembly, design 
and branding, with the vast majority of production 
industry provides an excellent example of producer-
driven networks. Leading assemblers such as Toyota and 
Ford coordinate production systems involving literally 
thousands of subsidiaries and tiers of subcontractor 
firms around the world, as well as extensive global net-
works of distributors and dealers.
Buyer-driven networks, by comparison, are charac-
teristic of industries where large retailers (e.g. Wal-Mart 
or Tesco) and brand-name merchandisers (e.g. Nike or 
Reebok) play the central role in establishing and shaping 
the network, with production activity itself often located 
in developing countries (see Figure 16.7). This form of 
global production network is common in labour-intensive 
consumer goods sectors, such as clothing, footwear, toys 
and handicrafts. Production is usually undertaken using 
tiered networks of subcontractors that supply finished 
goods subject to the specifications of the powerful buy-
ers. These buyers in turn extract substantial profits from 
bringing together their design, sales, marketing and finan-
cial expertise with strong brand names and access to large 
consumer markets.
The notions of producer- and buyer-driven networks 
are ideal types that allow us to get an overall impression of 
how a particular system functions, and in turn, who ben-
efits most from the way it functions. In reality, however, 
the governance of global production networks is highly 
complex and variable both within, and between, different 
economic sectors. We can think about this complexity in 
three ways. First, there may be other forms of govern-
ance that seem to better characterize the overall nature of 
a particular production network. For example, in some 
contexts it might be useful to think of relational forms 
of governance that fall in between the producer- and 
buyer-driven models (Gereffi et al. 2005). These can be 
thought of as close inter-firm relationships that develop 
on a more even footing. In others, it might be trading 
firms – such as the Japanese giant trading firms, the so-
called soga shosha – or intermediaries that drive the net-
work. In the Internet era, for example, there is evidence 
that new forms of ‘infomediaries’ with extensive access 
to online consumer information (e.g. Google, AOL, etc.) 
may play increasingly important roles in production net-
works (Gereffi 2001). Second, when we look at the detail 
of a particular production network, it is important to 
recognize that there may be a variety of governance types 
in operation between the various actors within the overall 
system. A study comparing the PC production networks 
in the Yangtze and Pearl River delta regions of China, 
for example, found that in reality governance relations 
are extremely complicated and, indeed, varied signifi-
cantly within the same industry (Yang and Coe 2009). 
Third, governance regimes are not static, but need to be  
seen in dynamic terms. The nature of a production

outsourced to Asian subcontractors, thereby sharing the 
characteristics of the lead firms in buyer-driven systems 
such as clothing and shoe production. Over time, there 
has clearly been a shift in the governance characteristics 
of the PC industry.
However, it is possible to make another argument 
relevant to the PC sector. The branded PC marketplace 
has become increasingly competitive over recent years 
as the standardization process has progressively reduced 
profit margins for even the leading firms. The result has 
being ongoing consolidation and rationalization, with 
several large brands being swallowed up by competitors 
(e.g. Compaq by HP, IBM by Lenovo). O'Riain (2004) 
has suggested that we might think of the PC network 
(and others like it) as falling into another governance 
category – the technology-driven network, in which it 
is control over technical standards which is critical for 
exercising power over the system. In that sense, it is the 
firms that set the dominant architectural standards for 
PCs in terms of software (Microsoft’s operating sys-
tems) and hardware (Intel’s computer chips) that benefit 
most from the production network and secure profits 
rates significantly higher than any other participants 
in the industry. ‘Power . . . resides, therefore, in what 
is ­getting made and mobilizing networks of support 
for those products rather than in how that product is 
itself produced – emphasizing the place of intellectual 
property holders in securing the rewards . . . within the 
system’ (O'Riain 2004: 645). These arguments are sup-
ported by detailed research into the gains associated 
with manufacturing a HP laptop computer (Dedrick 
et al. 2010). The study found that while Microsoft and 
Intel secured net profits of 36 and 31 per cent respec-
tively, and key component manufacturers in the range 
of 4 to 12 per cent, HP themselves only made a profit 
of 4 per cent, with the assembler (i.e. ODM) making an 
even lower profit rate of 2.4 per cent. These pressures 
are forcing the Taiwanese ODMs to branch out from 
laptop ­manufacturing into other segments, for instance 
Pegatron is moving into tablet production while Inventec 
and Quanta are expanding production of data servers. In 
Case study 16.1 we use the case of the iPhone to consider 
more broadly the issue of who gains from electronics 
global production networks.
Case study 16.1 
Who gains from electronics global 
production networks? The case of the 
iPhone 3
As with laptop computers, the final assembly of many 
leading smartphones also takes place in the coastal 
provinces in China. The Apple iPhone 3 (available from 
2009 to 2012) provides an interesting case in point 
(Xing and Detert 2010). It was primarily assembled by 
Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn at its huge produc-
tion complex in Shenzhen, China. Trade data records 
that, in 2009, 11.3 million iPhones were shipped to the 
USA from China at an average cost US$178.96 each, 
a trade flow of US$2.02 billion worth of goods. How-
ever, that presents a somewhat misleading picture. 
If you were to disassemble the iPhone 3, you would 
find that eight other companies, none of which are 
based in China, supplied the key manufactured com-
ponents assembled by Foxconn. The most important, 
by value, were provided by Toshiba (Japan), Samsung 
(Korea) and Infineon (Germany); the other five main 
suppliers were in the USA, Germany and Japan. 
Toshiba, for instance, contributed the touchscreen 
and the flash memory, while Samsung manufactured 
the all-important microprocessor. Unpacking the 
US$178.96 that Apple paid for an assembled iPhone 
3 to see where the money ultimately went shows that 
U$172.46 went to component manufacturers, leaving 
just US$6.50 to be accrued in China by Foxconn for 
product assembly (see chart below). For example, the

flash memory provided by Toshiba alone accounted 
for US$24.00 of the total, with this firm accruing 
around one-third of the total manufacturing costs of 
the iPhone. The US–China trade deficit created by 
iPhone shipments is therefore much smaller than it first 
appears, and a more realistic assessment of China’s 
contribution to the manufacturing process of iPhone 
becomes possible – essentially it is operating as a 
low-wage assembly location for components created 
elsewhere. Ultimately, of course, the biggest share of 
the value from an iPhone is captured by Apple itself; 
the ‘mark up’ on the iPhone creating a US retail price 
of US$300+. The wider lesson here is that assessing 
who gains most from global production networks – 
either in terms of firms or places – is not a simple 
process but requires a detailed understanding of the 
configuration of such networks and how they touch 
down in particular places.
➜
Returning to coffee, we can start to appreciate the com-
plexity and dynamism of global production networks. 
The coffee production network is not static in organi-
zational and governance terms. It can no longer simply 
be understood as a sequence of market transactions. 
Three changes illustrate this point. First, the roasters 
are increasingly concentrating on their roasting, blend-
ing and branding activities, employing coffee traders to 
source coffee and manage their supply networks for them, 
along with undertaking the steaming of certain kinds of 
beans. These are particularly important roles in a coffee 
network which is increasingly concerned with coffee qual-
ity testing and assurance, and reflect the establishment 
of more long-standing, relational connections between 
roasters and traders. Second, international traders are 
vertically integrating their operations by buying export 
firms in producing countries in order to ensure secure and 
high-quality supplies. This serves to consolidate the posi-
tion of traders within the system and potentially increase 
further the value captured by developed-country firms. 
In turn, the potential for developing countries’ producers 
and processors to upgrade their activity is restricted by the 
fact that roasting and final processing ideally needs to be 
undertaken near final markets. Third, growing consumer 
demand for new kinds of specialty, organic and fair-trade 
coffees has opened up some direct connections between 
producers and smaller roasting houses, potentially at least 
improving the financial returns for the coffee farmers con-
nected to these new networks. We shall return to this issue 
in the last section of the chapter.
In terms of the laptop production network, at the 
same time as branded PC firms have retreated from 
manufacturing activity, Taiwanese manufacturers have 
evolved or upgraded to take on new roles and, as a result, 
now occupy much more significant positions within the 
production network. Many Taiwanese firms started 
out as simple assemblers of components for PCs. Over 
time, they moved – through what is known as process 
­upgrading – into the manufacture and assembly of PCs 
sold under the brand names of other firms (i.e. they 
became OEMs – original equipment manufacturers). 
The next step was to develop design capacity, as we have 
already noted, becoming ODMs (original design manu-
facturers) through a step known as product upgrading. 
Next, some firms have taken things further and started to 
manufacture and sell PCs under their own brand, thereby 
becoming OBMs (original brand manufacturers) through 
functional upgrading. Acer, for example, started out as 
one of Taiwan’s main electronics suppliers, producing 
various computer products for international buyers. Over 
time, it separated off its OEM activity, leaving it to focus 
on the marketing and R&D activities of its own brand 
laptops. Acer’s rise to the very top of the industry was 
confirmed by the purchase of two large US PC brands, 
Gateway and Packard Bell, in 2007 and 2008 respec-
tively. Asus followed a similar path, spinning off much 
of its manufacturing activity into the now independent 
Pegatron. In reality, however, these categories may not 
map neatly onto individual firms, many of which will 
combine both OEM/ODM and OBM activities. In some 
cases, firms may be able to use their expertise to shift into 
entirely new production networks (e.g. from laptops to 
smartphones) in a shift termed chain upgrading (Kap-
linsky 2005).
Two further points should be noted here. First, there 
is no automatic or simple progression along this upgrad-
ing path. These shifts reflect changing strategies on the 
part of Taiwanese firms in response to changing market 
conditions. As PCs have become ever more standardized 
commodities, however, OEM and ODM producers have 
increasingly been squeezed for cost savings by branded 
PC firms. They have tended to respond in one or more 
of four different ways: moving into original brand man-
ufacturing themselves; making more components them-
selves as a way of cutting costs (i.e. vertically integrating 
their activity); trying to cut costs through production 
relocation within China; or by expanding in new but 
related product segments such as tablet computers. Sec-
ond, the successful ongoing upgrading of Taiwanese 
electronics firms is not only due to firm strategies and 
inter-firm networks. It also reflects a range of deliberate 
strategies pursued by the Taiwanese state to develop the 

Chapter 16  The geographies of global production networks    337
industry since the early 1970s, for example: the estab-
lishment of the Hsinchu Science Park; direct investment 
in early key players in the sector including UMC (United 
Microelectronics Corporation) and TSMC (Taiwan 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation); and steer-
ing developments in the industry through its agencies 
such as ERSO (Electronics Research Service Organiza-
tion), ITRI (Industrial Technology Research Institute) 
and CETRA (China External Trade Development Coun-
cil). These reveal the importance of also considering the 
institutional context of production networks, a topic to 
which we now turn.
16.5 The institutional context of 
production networks
So far we have focused almost entirely on the production 
network as a mesh of intra- and inter-firm connections. 
Production networks are also shaped by a wide range of 
extra-firm relationships that (as we saw in Figure 16.1) 
are an integral part of the system and may incorporate a 
wide range of non-firm entities (e.g. supranational organ-
izations, the state, labour unions, business associations, 
etc.). Expressed slightly differently, every relationship in a 
production network is shaped by its institutional context.
We can unpack the complexity of these institutional 
contexts in two ways. First, institutional context is signifi-
cant at various spatial scales. At the sub-national scale, 
local governments may seek to stimulate particular kinds 
of economic activity in their locality, for example by pro-
viding low-rent premises for small high-tech businesses. 
At the national scale, nation-states still wield a huge 
range of policy measures to try to promote, and steer, 
economic growth within their boundaries (Dicken 2015). 
Increasingly important in an era of globalization are 
measures designed to promote (or restrict) movements of 
traded products, investment and migrants across national 
boundaries. At the macro-regional scale, regional blocs 
such as the European Union or the North American Free 
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have considerable influence 
on trade and investment flows within their jurisdiction. 
At the global scale, supra-national institutions like the 
World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) increasingly determine the 
regulatory frameworks for global trading and financial 
relationships. Even a relatively simple global production 
network will, therefore, cross-cut and connect a wide 
range of institutional contexts. Second, it is important 
to distinguish between formal and informal institutional 
frameworks. The former relates to the rules and regula-
tions that determine how economic activity is undertaken 
in particular places (e.g. trade policy, tax policy, environ-
mental regulations and so on), while the latter refers to 
the rather less tangible, and often place-specific, ways of 
doing business that relate to the social, economic and 
political cultures of particular places.
Again, we can use the examples of coffee and laptop 
production to illustrate these arguments. First, the coffee 
production network demonstrates the importance of for-
mal institutional frameworks at the national and global 
scales. From 1962 to 1989, the international trading of 
coffee was governed by a series of International Coffee 
Agreements (ICAs) managed by the International Cof-
fee Organization (ICO), a supra-national organization 
made up of representatives of a wide range of coffee 
importing and exporting countries. The ICAs combined 
price bands and export quotas to provide a coffee trad-
ing system that was widely credited with both raising 
and stabilizing coffee prices. During this period, many 
exporting countries established coffee marketing boards: 
government institutions that controlled markets, moni-
tored quality and acted as a link to exporters and inter-
national traders (see Figure 16.2). Such boards provided 
an important protection for farmers and growers from 
the vagaries of the international coffee market. In 1989, 
however, the ICA was not renewed in the face of rising 
production levels and low-cost competition from non-
member exporting countries.
The ending of the ICA regime has dramatically altered 
the balance of power in the coffee chain, as the now mar-
ket-based coffee trading system has led to lower and more 
volatile coffee prices. Its demise has served to concentrate 
power in the hands of consuming-country firms, and in 
particular the small group of roasters introduced earlier. 
The collapse of the ICA has meant that coffee-producing 
countries are no longer cooperating, but are in fact com-
peting with each other, resulting in overproduction and a 
drop in prices which the roasters have been able to benefit 
massively from, a process exacerbated by the fact that 
consumer coffee prices have not dropped in a similar way, 
but have in fact risen significantly. At the same time, the 
national coffee marketing boards in the exporting coun-
tries either have been eliminated, or have retreated into 
a restricted overseeing role that has left them marginal-
ized within the production network (see dotted lines in 
­Figure 16.2). As a result of these changes to the inter-
linked international and national institutional contexts, 
millions of coffee farmers worldwide are exposed to price 
fluctuations on the global coffee market. On occasion, 
this can result in farmers receiving less for their coffee 
beans that it costs to grow them.
What this story shows is how changing institutional 
frameworks can impact on all the other dimensions of a 
global production network. In terms of its basic structure, 

338    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
the demise of the ICA has led to the bypassing of a pre-
viously important actor, namely the coffee marketing 
boards. In terms of changing geographies, the rapid growth 
of exports from Vietnam was both a cause of the ICA’s 
demise and at the heart of the subsequent overproduction. 
The expansion of production in Vietnam – strongly sup-
ported and marshalled by the government – also shows the 
significance of national institutional factors. Overall, in 
governance terms, the post-ICA regime has enabled a fur-
ther concentration of power in the hands of roasting firms.
The laptop industry is similarly affected by multi-scalar 
regimes of formal institutional relationships. For exam-
ple, as we have seen, rules governing outward investment 
from Taiwan to China were crucial in determining the 
timing of shifts in laptop production, and the fact that, 
for geopolitical reasons, direct flights between Taipei and 
China only restarted in 2008 had a significant impact on 
the practicalities of investment. Moreover, the role played 
by municipalities such as Kunshan, Suzhou and Wujiang 
in setting up industrial parks and actively courting invest-
ments from Taiwanese ODMs was crucial in helping the 
Shanghai region steal leadership in the Chinese PC indus-
try from the longer-established Guangdong cluster (Yang 
2009). Similar mechanisms underpin the more recent pro-
duction shifts to Chongqing. Here, however, we will use 
the laptop industry to open a window on a range of other 
less formal connections that are integral to the success of 
Taiwan’s electronics industries. More specifically, there is 
now increasing recognition of the significance of migration 
flows of skilled engineers between Taiwan and California 
for driving the economic success of both high-tech regions. 
Hsu and Saxenian (2000) describe the development of a 
transnational technical community linking Hsinchu and 
Silicon Valley. For several decades now, Taiwanese migrants 
to Silicon Valley – in combination with those from India, 
China and other parts of Asia – have played an important 
part in the continued dynamism of the Californian region 
through their entrepreneurial activity and links back to 
Asian markets and supplier firms.
However, the more recent reversal of this standard 
‘brain drain’ phenomenon has seen thousands of US-
educated engineers returning to Taiwan – reaching a 
peak of 5,000 per year in the mid-1990s – and playing 
a pivotal role in transforming it into a high wage and 
skill economy. ‘These returnees to Taiwan, many of 
whom had worked for at least a decade in the United 
States, brought with them not only technical skill but 
also organizational and managerial know-how, intimate 
knowledge of leading-edge IT markets, and networks of 
contacts in the United States technology sector’ (Sax-
enian 2006: 149). Return migrants have taken on lead-
ing roles in Taiwan’s technology sector: they are highly 
represented in the management cadre of leading firms, 
appear to be more entrepreneurial than non-migrants, 
and are active players in Taiwan’s burgeoning venture 
capital markets. Not all are permanent returnees, how-
ever: some have instead become the ‘new argonauts’ of 
the global economy (Saxenian 2006), criss-crossing the 
Pacific on a weekly or monthly basis and facilitating con-
nections between firms, suppliers, clients and investors 
in the two high-tech clusters. What these migrant flows 
serve to demonstrate is that global production networks 
in industries such as the PC sector are more than just for-
mally regulated firm-to-firm connections – they are also 
constituted by broader personal and knowledge flows.
16.6 Reshaping global production 
networks?
We now have an appreciation of how to identify, analyze 
and explain global production networks. But what if vari-
ous actors – and in particular, we as consumers – want 
to try to change how a production network is structured 
and operates? In an increasingly media-saturated and 
interconnected world, awareness has grown in consum-
ing countries of the social, economic and environmental 
conditions under which commodities are produced. This 
has seen a rise of so-called ethical consumption, whereby 
interventions surrounding the consumption stage are 
designed to improve conditions at points ‘upstream’ in 
the production network (see also Chapter 19). There are a 
number of forms such intervention may take. Perhaps the 
simplest form of consumer campaign is to boycott – that 
is, not purchase – the products of a particular company. 
We can also think of corporate campaigns that seek to 
target highly visible corporations by mobilizing informa-
tion regarding violations against workers or the environ-
ment, such as were targeted at the sweatshop operations of 
sportswear giants like Nike and Reebok in the late 1990s. 
Increasingly, however, the development of various kinds 
of benchmarks or standards – against which various end 
products and their production processes can be measured – 
are an increasingly important part of production network 
regulation within the global economy (see Figure 16.8).
The world of standards and codes has very rapidly 
become a broad and varied one. There are seven dimen-
sions to this complexity:
1.	 They may be applied to different facets of the pro-
duction system, for example environmental, social or 
labour conditions or rates of economic return.
2.	 They may take a variety of forms: a code of conduct, a 
label on a finished product, a tightly specified techni-
cal standard, a set of voluntary initiatives or a combi-
nation of some, or all, of these forms.

Chapter 16  The geographies of global production networks    339
3.	 They may apply to a particular chain (e.g. beef), a sec-
tor (e.g. fresh meat), or be generic (e.g. all fresh foods).
4.	 They may be developed by firms, NGOs, trade unions 
or international organizations, and usually by a com-
bination of some, or all, of these institutions.
5.	 The certification or accreditation of the standards – 
that is, judging whether they have been met – may be 
undertaken by public or private, and profit or not-for-
profit organizations.
6.	 They will range from the voluntary (e.g. seeking ‘Fair 
Trade’ status for a product) to the mandatory (e.g. 
safety standards for plastic toys).
7.	 They are inherently geographical, in terms of both the 
territory in which they apply (often the place of con-
sumption) and the places in which the effects are felt 
(usually places of production).
In terms of our two case studies in this chapter, we 
will focus exclusively on coffee, as these kinds of initia-
tives are more prevalent and developed in buyer-driven 
sectors characterized by labour-intensive production – 
e.g. shoes, garments, food stuffs, etc. A wide range of 
schemes seeking to promote sustainable coffee produc-
tion currently exist (Table 16.3). The eight listed schemes 
clearly illustrate the degrees of variation just described. 
For example, they may apply primarily to environmen-
tal or economic conditions (Bird-friendly vs. Fair Trade, 
respectively); involve a label or be primarily a code of 
conduct (Fair Trade vs. Utz Kapeh); and be global or 
regional in their coverage (Organic vs. Bird-friendly). 
Moreover, schemes may be initiated by companies  
(e.g. Starbuck’s CAFE – Coffee and Farmers Equity – 
Practices), civil society organizations (e.g. Fair Trade) or

multi-stakeholders organizations (e.g. 4C) encompassing 
a range of domains. A growing proportion of global cof-
fee falls under these schemes which are rapidly becoming 
mainstream: while the overall level was estimated at just 
1 per cent of total production in 2003, by 2013 the various 
schemes accounted for 40 per cent of global coffee pro-
duction. Interestingly, however, certified coffee accounted 
for only 15 per cent of the coffee purchased (e.g. between 
28–35 per cent of coffee certified as Fair Trade, Rainfor-
est Alliance and Utz Kapeh at the point of production 
was sold as such). This discrepancy suggests two things: 
first that there is a ceiling to market demand for gener-
ally more expensive certified coffee, and second that the 
schemes overlap, with the same coffee having multiple 

Chapter 16  The geographies of global production networks    341
certifications (e.g. there is significant overlap between 
Organic and Fair Trade coffee).
Such schemes have certainly initiated improvements in 
the social, economic and environmental conditions of the 
coffee growers that are enrolled in them. Growers of certi-
fied Fair Trade coffee, for example, are guaranteed a pre-
mium above the market price, and their product may fetch 
significantly more in certain market conditions. And yet 
we need to add some significant notes of caution, such as 
the fact that the majority of the world’s coffee farmers are 
still labouring outside the jurisdiction of these schemes 
which are voluntary in terms of participation. Addition-
ally, as we just saw, producing certified coffee does not 
necessarily mean the coffee will be sold as such. And we 
need to ask who pays for, and who benefits from, the cer-
tification process? The rise of standards-based schemes 
has fuelled the emergence of a new category of commod-
ity chain participant, the independent auditor – such as 
Scientific Certification Systems (SCS), for example, who 
audit the Starbucks scheme – many of whom themselves 
are profit-seeking firms. The costs of auditing long and 
complicated production networks are significant, and 
firms will vary in their ability and willingness to meet 
these costs. In many instances, buying firms will expect 
suppliers to meet the extra production costs. Farmers 
involved in certified organic coffee production in Oax-
aca State, Mexico, for example, may pay between 10 and 
30 per cent of their gross receipts to certify their produce. 
This serves as a significant barrier to entry and only the 
best organized and most well-funded farmers can turn 
organic production into a profitable enterprise (Muters-
baugh 2005). Together, these points suggest that we need 
to look carefully and critically at initiatives to alter the 
nature of global production networks; there is always the 
risk that, in certain contexts, they will serve to enhance 
the very injustices and inequalities they seek to diminish.
16.7 Conclusion
Returning to where we began, we now understand far 
more about the global economic interconnections and 
exchanges that enable the student in the café to drink a 
coffee and surf the Internet on her laptop computer. We 
could tell similar, yet at the same time profoundly differ-
ent, stories about the smartphone in her jacket pocket, 
about the jeans she is wearing, about the machine that 
brewed the coffee, the furniture in the café and so on. 
Whether the student in question is aware of the complex 
‘back stories’ of the commodities around her is uncer-
tain: as economic geographers, however, it is beholden 
on us to unravel those stories and their implications for 
the people and places across the globe that they connect.
This chapter has provided us with a framework and 
a language for exploring and understanding these eco-
nomic geographies. Sophisticated global production 
networks lie behind nearly all of the products and ser-
vices that we consume on a daily basis. These can be 
understood as the meshes of intra-, inter- and extra-firm 
relationships through which material and non-tangible 
inputs are transformed into consumable outputs of many 
kinds. They provide the organizational glue that con-
nects together the disparate local clusters of economic 
activity that constitute the ‘on the ground’ reality of the 
global economy. As a result of recent shifts associated 
with increased competition, technological change, and 
trade and foreign investment deregulation – for which 
globalization is often used as shorthand – global pro-
duction networks in general have arguably become more 
geographically extensive, disintegrated and dominated 
by developed-country buyers. Ultimately, however, each 
global production network has its own unique organiza-
tional structure, geographical configuration, governance 
regime and institutional context. In this chapter we have 
used just two examples, namely the coffee and laptop 
computer production networks, to explore some of this 
inherent variability in the configuration of global produc-
tion networks.
What this chapter has also demonstrated is the futil-
ity of seeking to understand the contemporary global 
economy and its workings without adopting a geo-
graphical perspective. Lead firms in global production 
networks use uneven geographies – taking advantages 
in differences in labour costs and skill levels, for exam-
ple – and in turn reshape those uneven geographies 
through their investment and disinvestment decisions. 
Today’s global economy is undoubtedly more compli-
cated and interdependent than ever before: it is the task 
of the economic geographer to unravel and explain this 
complexity.

 Chapter 17 

344    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
O
ther chapters in this book explore the environmen­
tal implications and inequalities of wealth crea­
tion at a variety of spatial scales. This chapter is about 
the large and complex capitalist economic system and, 
in particular, the ongoing shift from manufacturing 
to services that is being experienced by a range of 
economies (Plate 17.1). Put another way, it is a shift 
towards various forms of expertise- or knowledge-
intensive employment in economies that are increas­
ingly structured around experiences (Sundbo 2015). 
Services support all aspects of everyday living – 
logistics, communications, dining, entertainment, 
education – and have become an important compo­
nent of international trade. In 2013 the value of world 
exports of commercial services was US$4.6 trillion, 
or 20 per cent of total trade (WTO 2014: 24–5). The 
export of commercial services had increased from 
US$1439 billion in 2000.
The focus here is on understanding some of the 
dynamics of expertise-intensive service work, with the 
important caveat that the complexity of the modern 
economy makes it problematical to view service activities 
as a distinct and separate category from manufacturing. 
One consequence is that the other chapters in this section 
that cover aspects of manufacturing, finance, knowledge-
intensive services, and even consumption, should be seen 
as part of an integrated whole. Isolating finance, manu­
facturing or food production processes from a range of 
service functions overlooks the multiple interconnec­
tions between them to form a complex and integrated 
production system. The flows of money and finance that 
take place around the world in the twinkling of an eye 
are manipulated and coordinated by service workers, 
or more specifically knowledge workers. They convert 
information into knowledge that then informs investment 
decisions of all kinds; this is enabled by manufactured 
technologies such as computers. Many manufacturing 
firms now produce hybrid products that blend service 
and manufacturing tasks (Bryson and Rusten 2011), for 
example smartphones combine a good, the phone, with 
a service, an advanced operating system that links the 
phone to a complex array of web-based services (Bry­
son and Rusten 2011). This implies that a post-industrial 
society is not inevitably a post-manufacturing society; it 
thrives on the relationship between production, manufac­
turing and services in which the latter are just part of a 
much more complex production process. Economic geog­
raphers should explore production in the round rather 
than exploring aspects of manufacturing and service 
activities in relative isolation.
This chapter begins by defining services and placing 
them within the context of the overall production system. 
The continued development of this system over time (and 
space) reflects the ongoing process of economic speciali­
zation that has in turn driven the continuous extension of 
the division of labour, which is ‘one of the foundational 
features of what capital is about’ (Harvey 2014: 112) and 
the development of a new spatial division of exper-
tise. The division of labour refers to the disaggregation 
of complex activities into discrete tasks that comprise 
a continuous extension of the division of labour and 
the development of a new spatial division of expertise. 
The latter is a key concept that will be examined in more 
detail in the second part of this chapter where the ways 
in which service expertise is integrated into complex 
production systems are explored. The chapter concludes 
with an introduction to some of the characteristics of 
services offshoring/reshoring, global sourcing or the rise 
of the second global shift (Bryson 2007).
17.1 Defining services
A walk through a supermarket highlights the role that 
marketing, advertising and packaging design services 
play in our society. Simple products incorporate quanti­
ties of visible and often invisible service expertise; the 
former as advertising campaigns and the latter as the 
logistics services that ensure that raw materials and 
completed manufactured goods are transported and dis­
tributed efficiently to producers and consumers. Much 
of the service expertise hidden within products arises 
from the constant search for product differentiation. In 
the economically developed market economies, the vast 
majority, often more than 75 per cent, of all jobs involve 
some form of service work (Bryson et al. 2004; Bryson 
and Daniels 2015a, 2015b). Furthermore, in Europe,

regionally, nationally and internationally. They are also 
heavily wrapped within and around the production pro­
cesses of manufactured goods as well as other services; 
they add value by smoothing the relationship between 
production and consumption, for example via market 
research, product design, development and testing and 
advertising (Bryson and Rusten 2011) (Spotlight box 
17.1). Services can be exported either directly via transfer 
across borders or direct representation of the provider in 
another country or indirectly through the incorporation 
of a service into a product or another service which is 
then exported.
North America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, as 
well as parts of the developing world, some 90 per cent 
of new jobs are created in services (Table 17.1). As a 
result, the economies and societies of these countries 
appear to revolve predominantly around service activi­
ties and the experience of service work. Indeed, schol­
ars and policy makers generally accept that developed 
market economies are now dominated by various forms 
of service work, ranging from extremely well-paid law­
yers and merchant bankers to less well-paid hotel and 
retail workers. Services contribute to economic growth 
in a variety of ways; for example, they are traded locally,

Services and the production process
The creation of any product or service requires ser-
vice expertise to be embedded in different parts of 
the production process – pre-production, during pro-
duction and post-production or consumption (Figure 
17.1) (Bryson and Daniels 2015b). Pre-production 
involves understanding the design process, including 
market research and the ability to innovate; it may be 
applied to the design of a production process as well 
as to an actual product or service (Bryson and Rusten 
2011). The development of services may require the 
creation or modification of a process, for example the 
systems that support a financial services transaction or 
the check-in process at an airport. Services incorpo-
rated into the production process are concerned with 
achieving its efficient management, for example per-
formance management of a manufacturing process, 
queue management at leisure parks or call monitoring 
in call centres. Post-production incorporates marketing 
and related services or supporting services, for exam-
ple finance packages linked to the purchases of goods 
(cars, furniture).
The production process can be divided into five parts 
with each part requiring different forms of service knowl-
edge and expertise:
1.	 Pre-manufacturing – product development, 
research & development, design, product testing, 
market research, finance.
2.	 During manufacturing – finance, quality control, 
stock control, purchasing, safety, management, 
continuity/contingency planning, testing, etc.
3.	 Selling – logistics, distribution networks, marketing, 
finance.
4.	 During product and system utilization – 
maintenance, leasing, finance, etc.
5.	 After product and system utilization – waste 
management, recycling, etc.

During the 1970s economists tended to consider 
services as ‘immaterial goods or simply as goods’ (Hill 
1977: 315). But services are not goods; they exhibit a 
range of characteristics that fundamentally distinguish 
them from goods. Hill (1977) identified some of the 
primary differences between goods and services begin­
ning with the observation that a diverse selection of ser­
vices, the shipment of goods by a transport firm, vehicle 
repair, painting and decorating, the cleaning of a house 
by servants, hairdressing and dentistry, actually share a

classification of service activities incorporates six differ­
ent types:
1.	 Consumer services that provide services for final end-
users, for example retailers, opticians, hotels and retail 
banks.
2.	 Producer and business services that provide interme­
diate inputs into the activities of private- and public-
sector organizations.
3.	 Services incorporated in to manufactured goods. This 
includes goods that are leased to provide services, for 
example, Rolls-Royce, the British engine manufac­
turer, leases engines to provide ‘power-by-the-hour’ 
(Bryson 2010: 698).
4.	 Public services provided directly by the state or 
indirectly by the private sector and not-for-profit 
organizations.
5.	 Not-for-profit organizations working beyond the con­
fines of the state (Bryson et al. 2002).
6.	 Informal services or unpaid service work, which is usu­
ally predominantly undertaken by women, and which 
is a vital element of peoples’ daily lives.
Each of these categories includes a heterogeneous col­
lection of service functions. It is not proposed to cover 
them all in this chapter. Rather, the focus here is pre­
dominantly on knowledge-intensive services (second in 
the list above). This reflects the increasing importance 
of a group of distinctive activities that have exhibited 
dramatic growth rates in both the numbers of firms 
established and their contribution to employment crea­
tion. It incorporates key sectors such as legal services, 
accountancy, market research, management consultancy, 
design and technical consultancy. All these services make 
an important contribution to economic development. 
They contribute directly to the creation of added value; 
they contribute to a national economy’s balance of 
­payments through exports; and they have also experi­
enced dramatic growth rates in employment as well as 
new firm formation.
17.2 Two common misconceptions 
about service economies
It is far too easy to assume that manufacturing no longer 
matters in economies that are dominated by service 
employment. Many service jobs are highly visible within 
the economy, as a visit to a local shopping centre satu­
rated with service experiences shows. In contrast, manu­
facturing employment remains largely invisible since the 
production process is almost always isolated from the 
consumption of the product (Bryson et al. 2008; Bryson 
common set of characteristics. For Hill the two defining 
characteristics were the way in which services brought 
about:
1.	 A change or transformation in the condition of a good 
or person.
2.	 A change that is the result of the activity of another 
individual or firm.
Hill used these principles to construct what is con­
sidered to be the classic service definition: ‘A service 
is defined as a change in the condition of a person, or 
of a good belonging to some economic unit, which is 
brought about as the result of the activity of some other 
economic unit, with the prior agreement of the former 
person or economic unit’ (Hill 1977: 318). While very 
useful, this definition also highlights one of the primary 
problems with the category of services, namely that in 
many instances the consumer often only observes or 
experiences the production or performance of the service 
(Sundbo 2015). This simultaneous production and con­
sumption, and even co-production of a service, creates 
confusion between the process of producing it and the 
final end process of consumption. This added complex­
ity may be confusing but fundamental to the distinction 
between goods and services should be the realization that 
the delivery of the latter does not result in the exchange 
of ownership of a material product. The output of 
many services is ephemeral or non-material, for exam­
ple attendance at a lecture or viewing/experiencing a live 
theatrical performance. It is often suggested that software 
could be considered as a material service since it is can 
be stored on a computer device, but this overlooks the 
fact that the software provider does not transfer complete 
ownership of the software to the user: most of us own the 
software under licence from the service provider. This is 
different from the way in which ownership of a laptop 
computer or a mobile phone is physically transferred 
from the seller to the purchaser.
It is important not to become too distracted by 
attempts to arrive at a precise definition of service activi­
ties. Nevertheless, their classification is an important 
activity for those engaged in measuring the economy, for 
example national statistical agencies. It is far too easy 
to become preoccupied with systems of classification at 
the expense of understanding the changing dynamics of 
capitalism. In any event, such is the pace of economic 
change that classifications have to be continually modi­
fied to incorporate the development of new types of work 
or the on-going ‘extended division of labour’ (Sayer and 
Walker 1992; Bryson 2009).
All attempts to classify services must accommodate 
the complexity and diversity of the business activi­
ties involved (Illeris 2007). For our purposes a simple 

348    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
(Hyde 1973). As the United Kingdom and the United 
States were becoming industrialized societies they were 
simultaneously being transformed into service econo­
mies; the growth of manufacturing employment went 
hand in hand with the growth of service employment.
17.2.2 Productivity and services and the myth 
of ­service economies
Since the nineteenth century the employment structure 
of many countries has steadily shifted away from manu­
facturing to service employment. This shift should not be 
equated with the demise of manufacturing or the com­
plete displacement of manufacturing with service work. 
Many national economies (Germany, Italy; see Table 
17.1) are still dominated by the development, design, 
manufacture and sale of goods; the absence of manufac­
turing within a national economy would present serious 
problems since everyday life as well as service work is 
supported by a complex array of manufactured prod­
ucts – clothes, toasters, cars, clocks, toothpaste, tissues, 
deodorant, laptops and toys (Bryson and Rusten 2011). 
Some of these products can of course be traded between 
countries but many need to be manufactured or custom­
ized locally, for example products that are difficult or 
impossible to transport (perishable foods, commercial 
air-conditioning systems) or production processes that 
require close contact between producers and consumers, 
for example, customized alterations to machine tools or 
the co-innovation of new products (Bryson et al. 2008).
Since products can be traded for services, it is pos­
sible to argue that manufacturing no longer needs to 
be undertaken in service-dominated economies. Nev­
ertheless, many services support and are supported by 
et al. 2015). This separation of the production process 
from the moment of consumption is atypical of many 
service-based economic relationships. The dominance 
of the latter and the apparent recent shift from manu­
facturing has led to two common misconceptions about 
service employment and it is to these that we now turn 
our attention.
17.2.1 Services as old as the Industrial Revolution
It is a common mistake to assume that the transformation 
of economies towards services is a phenomenon of the 
twentieth century. The social sciences have paid too little 
attention to the role services played during the Industrial 
Revolution or earlier. A good example is the development 
of London in the nineteenth century as the command and 
control centre of the British Empire. A detailed analysis 
of London’s fire office registers between the years 1775 
and 1825 concluded by noting that the
service industries made no less contribution to the 
British economy during the Industrial Revolution 
than manufacturing, and that nowhere was this more 
true than in London. Its service economy was on a 
very large scale, serving the nation as a whole as well 
as the capital . . . London’s service industries under­
pinned both its own and the national manufacturing 
and commercial infrastructure and at the same time 
contributed to the new ‘commercialisation of leisure’.
(Barnett 1998: 183)
During the late eighteenth century London was already 
being transformed into an important world city; a pro­
cess that has continued to the present and which has fur­
ther enhanced its status as a global city (see ­Chapter 14). 
Deane and Cole (1962: 166, 175) calculated that in 1851 
some 45.3 per cent of the United Kingdom’s national 
income was derived from service activities (trade, trans­
port, housing, the professions and the civil service) as the 
structure of employment changed dramatically as a result 
of technological innovation and the increasing maturity 
and extension of the capitalist system. Growth occurred 
in occupations that facilitated the exchange of goods and 
services between producers and consumers (Plate 17.2). 
Between 1881 and 1901 the number of business clerks 
increased from 175,000 to 308,000; bank officials from 
16,000 to 30,000; and insurance officials and clerks from 
15,000 to 55,000 (Marsh 1977: 124). During the nine­
teenth century the expansion of international trade was 
restricted by financial problems until it was enabled and 
supported by the introduction of bill markets and bank­

Chapter 17  Service economies, spatial divisions of expertise and the second global shift     349
between work practices and new technologies (such as the 
introduction of people-facilitated, as well as automated, 
call centres) but is either non-existent or extremely low 
in, for example, medical services, teaching and the crea­
tive industries. It is very difficult for a dance company 
to achieve productivity improvements; it involves putting 
on more performances, using fewer dancers, or increas­
ing the speed of delivery to enable two performances to 
be given during the time previously devoted to a single 
performance. This is a good illustration of the fact that 
many service occupations are labour-intensive (Moretti 
2013: 63) and often involve face-to-face interactions 
between service providers and clients for which produc­
tivity improvements are difficult to achieve. As a result, 
overall productivity improvements in the service side of 
the economy have, as a general rule, lagged behind manu­
facturing with the implication that this differential partly 
explains the shift from manufacturing to service work.
The significance of this reasoning can be demonstrated 
with reference to UK manufacturing exports, which 
amounted to £230 billion or 46 per cent of total exports 
in 2013 (Rhodes 2014). Yet manufacturing directly 
employed only 2.62 million workers, with a further 3 
million jobs dependent on the sector. A major problem 
is that official definitions of manufacturing employment 
do not include jobs and activities that depend on, or are 
closely allied to, manufacturing such as design or market­
ing activities undertaken by specialist ‘service’ providers. 
Recent research has identified that some of the highest 
paid services are tied to manufacturing, for example 
research and development, design and finance (Sisson 
2011). One difficulty with analyzing the shift towards 
service-dominated economies is that activities that were 
once undertaken in vertically-organized manufacturing 
firms have been outsourced and are now purchased on 
the market (Levinson 2013).
On average, UK manufacturing output has grown by 
1.4 per cent a year since 1948, but it contracted during the 
economic downturns of the early 1970s, 1990s and fol­
lowing the 2008 economic downturn. The overall rate of 
output growth has been at a much slower rate than other 
sectors of the British economy (Hardie and Banks 2014). 
Thus, although the gross added value (GVA) created by 
manufacturing increased by 26 per cent over the period 
1992 and 2003 (Figure 17.2), it was actually lower than 
the rate achieved in other sectors of the economy. Service 
sectors were growing at a much faster rate even though 
in absolute, rather than relative, terms manufacturing’s 
contribution to the overall economy increased over this 
time period. It is important to recognize that a restruc­
turing of economic activity is taking place; new types 
of economic activity such as information management 
or digital services (e.g. website design) are flourishing 
manufacturing activities, for example the complete 
removal of manufacturing from the West Midlands 
(United Kingdom) would reduce the client base of local 
service companies by 25 per cent (Daniels and Bryson 
2005: 3). It has also become apparent that a national 
economy that is over-reliant on products that are manu­
factured elsewhere is increasingly exposed to many differ­
ent types of risk. First, since the 2008 financial crisis and 
global recession manufacturing firms in Germany and the 
UK have proved to be more resilient than many service 
firms with increases in employment, output and exports 
(Markit 2011). Over-reliance on products manufactured 
abroad also has implications for health and safety. In 
August 2007, for example, Mattel, the world’s largest toy 
company, issued a product recall for 436,000 toys made 
in China that were painted with lead-based paint and 
18.2 million toys that were designed with small magnets 
that could become detached. This type of product recall 
provides American toy manufacturers with a competitive 
advantage as they are able to market their toys as ‘Made 
in America’ (Rusten et al. 2007) and as ‘100 per cent kid-
safe’ (Martin 2007).
After the Second World War, manufacturing employ­
ment encountered gales of creative destruction (Schum­
peter 1942) that eventually culminated in, what some 
commentators have termed, the crisis of Fordism (Gaffikin 
and Nickson 1984). This led to an ongoing reduction in 
manufacturing employment and a shift towards a diverse 
collection of service jobs. The difficulty is that scholars 
and policy makers tend to equate such a decline of (often) 
high-profile manufacturing firms with a contraction in 
manufacturing overall. In practice it does not mean that 
countries in Europe and North America, for example, 
have been transformed into service economies; it is essen­
tial that a distinction is made between adjustments to the 
employment composition of an economy and changes in 
economic output (productivity). These two indicators of 
economic change are not necessarily related, or they are 
related in unexpected ways.
Especially important is that the types of productivity 
improvements that have been achieved by manufacturers 
through automation and process improvements are not 
necessarily achievable by service providers. The category 
‘services’ includes an extremely diverse group of business 
activities: from very highly paid professional occupations 
(lawyers, surgeons, bankers) to very poorly paid occu­
pations (janitors, waiters). The common denominator 
is that, unlike manufacturing, many of these occupa­
tions rely on people-based skills or what is commonly 
termed ‘embodied labour’ (Bryson et al. 2004; Bryson 
and Daniels 2015a). In these circumstances the chal­
lenge of improving productivity is considerable. It is at 
its highest and still increasing where there is interaction

cent in market research and management consultancy 
(Figure 17.2 and Table 17.1). In 2004, computer services 
alone accounted for 2.9 per cent of total GVA (£30.0 bil­
lion). It is clear then that the recent growth of the UK 
economy has been led by service industries; they com­
prise all of the top ten fastest growing industries between 
1992 and 2004, for example. An inexorable decline in 
manufacturing employment has therefore been offset by 
employment gains in services.
While the shift towards services is ongoing the 
economy continues to be integrated in complex ways 
and it is important to identify and explore some of the 
interactions between manufacturing and service activi­
ties. The question is ‘How does this perspective affect 
our interpretation of employment gains in services at 
the expense of manufacturing?’ After all, the employ­
ment roster of a manufacturing company can be largely 
made up of individuals working on activities such as 
alongside the development of innovations in well-estab­
lished services such as insurance, banking and retailing. 
Such restructuring arises from, first, the externalization 
of previously in-house services to independent providers 
and, second, the continuation of an extended division 
of labour based upon the development of new services, 
technologies and business models. The latter arises from 
the growing complexity that accompanies many service 
innovations as service providers seek to refine product 
differentiation in the marketplace.
While most of the key manufacturing sectors have 
therefore declined in relative terms, and some in abso­
lute terms (for example, footwear, knitted goods, leather 
goods, man-made fibres, wearing apparel), the service 
sector has expanded, whether measured by employment 
or GVA. In the United Kingdom between 1992 and 2004 
GVA increased by 381.5 per cent in computer services, 
252.2 per cent in other business services and 266.2 per

experiences must be co-created as part of an interaction 
between service producers and consumers delivered by 
people rather than by machines. Unlike manufacturing, it 
is difficult, and in many instances impossible, to replace 
service workers with machines and this means that pro­
ductivity improvements are difficult for those services 
that rely on people-based expertise. This is an important 
point given that some service activities can certainly be 
codified and replaced with relatively simple computer 
programs. A good example is an application for a mort­
gage that can be processed by a computer using simple 
rule-based logic such as a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, 
for example, related to the value of the property or the 
income of the applicant(s) (Levy and Murnane 2004: 
16–17). Yet it is very much the case that such simple rule-
based software cannot replace many service jobs because 
they require complex pattern recognition such as reading 
body language in service encounters.
The importance of face-to-face contact in the simulta­
neous production and consumption of a range of services 
plays an important role in differentiating the new world 
of service work from that of manufacturing (McDowell 
2009). At the centre of interactive service relationships 
are three important elements: client interaction, an indi­
vidual’s reputation, and embodied knowledge. In this ser­
vice age, the workplace is increasingly conceptualized as 
a stage upon which employees must execute an aestheti­
cally pleasing performance. Service employment is not 
simply about the exchange of goods or services but is a 
complex skill in which presentation, communication and 
display are integral to success (Bryson and Wellington 
2003: 60). It follows that for some service jobs, appear­
ance, the body and accent matter (McDowell 2007) and 
this implies that service economies have within them 
cohorts of people who do not possess the desired bodily 
attributes to meet the expectations of employers and per­
haps customers (Bryson and Wellington 2003). McDowell 
argues that in the United Kingdom this group includes 
white working-class males who find it difficult to obtain 
well-paid service work.
The academic literature on service work is heav­
ily influenced by Arlie Hochschild’s (1983) important 
work on the commercialization of emotions in face-to-
face service encounters. Hochschild was inspired by C. 
Wright Mills’s (1959 [1951]) classic work, White Collar. 
Mills was the first sociologist to explore the complexity 
and diversity of service work in his analysis of the new 
American middle class. Mills developed the concept of 
the ‘personality market’ to describe the ‘shift from skills 
with things to skills with people’ (1959: 182); central to 
this shift is the enhanced importance of the psychologi­
cal dimensions of service work. In this account of the 
new world of work, men and women ‘are to be shaped’ 
marketing, advertising, management, accounting and 
purchasing. This returns the analysis to the definition 
of manufacturing and services. On the one hand, we can 
suggest that part of the shift towards service employ­
ment reflects a transfer of service tasks that were pre­
viously undertaken within manufacturing firms to 
external service providers. On the other hand, we can 
suggest that ‘although the objective of manufacturing 
industry is the production of commodities many people 
employed in manufacturing are not directly employed in 
the actual production process’ (Crum and Gudgin 1977: 
3). Questions then follow about the wisdom of dividing 
the economy into service and manufacturing activities 
(Daniels and Bryson 2002; Bryson and Rusten 2011). In 
1971 every two production workers needed to be sup­
ported by rather more than one non-production worker 
(Crum and Gudgin 1977: 5); the term non-production is 
used to identify people within a manufacturing firm who 
are not directly involved in the actual production process 
(managers, designers, sales team, research scientists).
Since Crum and Gudgin’s research, there have been 
two major organizational changes to production pro­
cesses. First, knowledge has become more important as 
well as being increasingly combined or embedded within 
products and services. Second, the production of goods 
and services has increasingly required the blending of dif­
ferent types of expertise that include processes involving 
shop-floor workers (manufacturing as well as services) 
and a complex array of service and management exper­
tise. All these different types of expertise can be organ­
ized within a manufacturing company or, alternatively, 
by buying in the activities provided by many separate and 
independently owned service firms. These relationships 
between manufacturing and services can be measured as 
‘multiplier’ effects whereby jobs in one sector create jobs 
in other sectors. For example, Bivens (2003) has estimated 
that in the United States business services have an employ­
ment multiplier of 1.63: that is, every business service job 
creates 1.63 jobs elsewhere in the economy. Manufactur­
ing jobs have an employment multiplier of 2.91 and jobs 
in transportation a multiplier of 1.66. The high multi­
plier for manufacturing highlights that the production of 
goods creates jobs in other manufacturing firms, as well 
as in transportation, business services and retailing.
17.3 The body, services and emotional 
labour
The classic definition of services developed by Hill (1977) 
highlights the importance of people-based expertise in 
the creation of services. This implies that many service

not surprisingly, is highly visible in interactive business 
service occupations and, in particular, the ‘professional 
managerial classes’.
The importance of the body and image in service 
economies has led to a new occupation, that of image 
consultancy or impression management. Image con­
sultants are employed by individuals and firms to alter 
the surface appearance of the body. Image consultants 
provide seminars and one-to-one consultations directly 
related to the restructuring of professional employees’ 
bodies. According to Wellington and Bryson (2001: 940):
KPMG [the accountancy firm] employs image consult­
ants on a monthly basis primarily to provide employ­
ees with a ‘confidence boost’, and also to provide staff 
with a ‘bonding experience’. The accountants Coop­
ers and Lybrand as well as Ernst and Young hire image 
consultants to provide seminars in personal presen­
tation for their audit teams. These seminars exam­
ine ways of increasing credibility and projecting the 
right image when undertaking client audits and when 
pitching for new business. Price Waterhouse employed 
image consultants to instruct potential partners in 
dining etiquette and in the art of looking, acting and 
sounding like a partner of a major global accountancy 
company. Note the use of the terms act and art and 
the link to the literature on flight attendants.
(Taylor and Tyler 2000)
The literature on emotional labour suggests that in the 
service economy employees have to develop skills in deal­
ing directly with people. The implication is that extrovert 
personalities may have little difficulty in fitting into this 
new world of service work, but that introverts may experi­
ence some challenges. It is important to remember that in 
many instances facing-based work that is heavily involved 
in emotional labour will be supported by back office or 
out-of-client-sight supporting labour. This suggests that 
a new division of labour is developing that links front and 
back office workers together. The concept of emotional 
labour also highlights the importance of proximity in the 
co-creation of services (Bryson 2007). Developments in 
information and communications technology continue 
to transform the relationship between geography and 
economic activity. In 1970, Tobler famously identified 
what he termed ‘the first law of geography; everything is 
related to everything else, but near things are more related 
than distant things’ (1970: 236). This ‘law’ draws atten­
tion to the importance of the localization of relation­
ships of all types – social, economic, financial, service, 
etc. Tobler’s first law is important for understanding ser­
vices: all expertise, knowledge and emotional labour is 
determined by its geographical context.
(1959: 183) and their personalities managed, by them­
selves and by others.
Horchschild developed Mills’s work by undertaking 
theoretically grounded research into the commercializa­
tion of the body and the feelings of male and female 
flight attendants and debt collectors. Central to this 
analysis is ‘emotional labour’, a concept that describes 
the management of employees’ feelings during social 
interaction in the work process (Hochschild 1983: 137). 
The best example is the emphasis placed on providing 
a ‘service with a smile’ to show customers that they are 
valued. Hochschild reveals that much face-to-face inter­
active service work (flight attendants, debt collectors, 
waitresses, secretaries, fast-food operations) involves 
having to present the ‘right’, managerially prescribed, 
emotional appearance or mask to the customer or client, 
and that this involves real labour. In these occupations 
workers are faced with the dilemma of how to identify 
with their work role without it becoming part of their 
identity.
Service employees have to depersonalize the work 
by ‘surface acting’ and ‘deep acting’. In surface acting 
‘we deceive others about what we really feel, but we do 
not deceive ourselves’ (Hochschild 1983: 33); the body 
not the soul is the main tool of the trade; the smile on 
the face of the worker is a false smile, but it is still a 
smile. In emotional labour a smile becomes attached to 
the feelings that a company wishes to project rather than 
being attached to its usual function – to show a personal 
feeling (Hochschild 1983: 127). In deep acting the ‘act’ 
is no longer an act but becomes part of the individual’s 
persona. It is about persuading employees to be sincere, 
‘to go well beyond the smile that’s just “painted on”’ 
(Hochschild 1983: 33). Unprecedented efforts are being 
made by employers to control employees not simply in 
terms of what they say and do at work, but also how they 
feel and view themselves. In deep acting the disjunction 
between displayed emotions and private feeling is severe 
and potentially psychologically damaging. The danger is 
that deep acting becomes part of the worker’s person­
ality and is used beyond the workplace. If this occurs 
then the new ‘emotional proletariat’ (Macdonald and 
Sirianni 1996) might find it difficult to ‘interpret and take 
appropriate action in response to bodily signals’ (Shilling 
1993: 119). Hochschild’s account of male debt collectors 
highlights how the display of aggression required by debt 
collectors can spill over into personal relationships with 
wives and children. According to Bryson and Welling­
ton (2003: 62), ‘active involvement in “emotional labour” 
renders employees’ appearance and personality a form 
of “adjudicated cultural capital” that can be recruited, 
managed, manipulated and utilized to buy the hearts and 
minds of consumers’. The commodification of image,

arithmetic in which he noted that one of the greatest 
English clockmakers of the seventeenth century, Thomas 
Tompion (1639–1713), produced watches via a complex 
division of labour in which ‘one man [sic] shall make the 
Wheels, another the Spring, another shall engrave the 
Dial-place, and another shall make the Cases, then the 
Watch will be better and cheaper, than if the whole work 
be put upon one man’ (Petty 2004[1678]: 16).
Adam Smith’s theory makes no explicit reference to 
geography. The obvious extension of the division of labour 
is to incorporate geography into the process, and this 
leads to a spatial division of labour (Massey 1984). Once 
a production process had been subdivided into its com­
ponent parts it is a comparatively simple step to construct 
warehouses or offices dedicated to a particular part of the 
production process, such as consignment assembly and 
packing for despatch or a marketing function. The spatial 
division of labour began with manufacturers establishing 
specialist units that were contiguously located, but soon 
developed into a more dispersed spatial division of labour. 
Different parts of the production process were located 
close to sources of raw materials, the market, or cheap 
or skilled labour. Very quickly, some regions and coun­
tries came to specialize in particular types of economic 
activity. For example, a (international) division of labour 
soon developed between the industrial countries (core) 
producing manufactured goods and the non-industrialized 
countries (semi-/periphery) supplying raw materials and 
agricultural goods as well as a market for manufactured 
products. This spatial division of labour can occur within 
service or manufacturing firms (Bryson et al. 2004) (Case 
study 17.1). One location (a major city such as London) 
is used for the headquarters (HQ), another for research 
and development (R&D), yet another (a peripheral region, 
South Wales, or a country, China) for the manufacturing 
branch plant, and sales and service centres will be distrib­
uted over the globe (Bryson and Rusten 2008).
17.4 Services and the spatial division 
of expertise
The division of labour is a key concept for understanding 
the organization of work under capitalism and the shift 
towards service activities. In 1776 Adam Smith published 
The Wealth of Nations, in which he established the foun­
dations of economic theory. For Smith,
the greatest improvement in the productive powers 
of labour, and the greatest part of the skill, dexterity, 
and judgement with which it is anywhere directed, or 
applied, seem to have been the effects of the division 
of labour.
(Smith 1977: 109)
To illustrate the importance of the division of labour, 
Smith explores pin-making, suggesting that an individual 
without knowledge of the production process would be 
unable to make even one pin in a day. The production 
process of pin-making can be divided into 18 distinct 
operations: from the drawing out of the wire to the mak­
ing of the pin head. If one person performs all of these 
tasks, then they might make 20 pins in a day. If, however, 
individuals specialize in particular tasks, by introducing 
a division of labour, Smith shows how ten people could 
make 48,000 pins in a day (Bryson and Henry 2005).
Adam Smith’s division of labour is based on his obser­
vations of specialization within factories. There is no rea­
son, however, why its principles should not be applied to 
the services production process, not least to the ways in 
which new service activities are identified and firms devel­
oped to create a market for the provision of new forms 
of services. It is worth noting that the division of labour 
was extremely well known prior to Adam Smith’s work. 
In 1678 Sir William Petty published an essay on political 
Case study 17.1 
ICT and business process outsourcing 
factories in the Philippines and India
Developments in ICT have made the transfer of 
service jobs to low-cost locations possible (Bryson 
et al. 2004; Bryson 2007). What is occurring is an 
intriguing ongoing international division of labour, 
but with a difference; it used to be that branch plants 
in developing or less developed countries were only 
associated with the assembly of products designed by 
and for the developed world: now, many such branch 
plants process data and/or interact with customers 
located thousands of miles away.
Data-processing factories, for example, in the 
Caribbean or Philippines are linked via cable and 
satellite with service workers in Ireland, the Dominican 
Republic, Jamaica, Mauritius and the United States. To 
Freeman this development ‘signals an intensification of 
transnational production and consumption – of labour, 
capital, goods, services and styles’ (2000: 1). In 2013, 
➜

354    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
the Axiem Corporation established a business process 
outsourcing (BPO) facility in Mandaluyoing City, Philip-
pines. The company employs over 200 providing data 
entry, call centre services, accountancy and IT services 
to clients from Australia, New Zealand, Europe, USA 
and Asia. It is worth emphasizing that this example 
highlights the shift away from the provision by offshore 
BPS providers of relatively simple data entry to the 
provision of more knowledge-based services such as 
accountancy including taxation.
Call-centre operations are labour-intensive, labour 
accounting for over 65 per cent of their running costs. 
In the 1990s, in the United Kingdom, American Express 
and British Airways (BA) transferred their customer 
services divisions from the United Kingdom to Delhi and 
then Bombay. BA was attracted by India’s large pool of 
English-speaking graduates who could be employed on 
starting salaries of between £1,500 and £2,500. India 
has dominated the market for the provision of English-
speaking call centres, but is being challenged by coun-
tries like the Philippines. Every year India produces 2 
million graduates, mostly taught through English, and 
who are desperate for well-paid employment in a coun-
try where the national average wage is £300. It has 
been estimated that the Philippines has 350,000 call 
handlers compared to 330,000 in India; Philippine call-
centre workers speak English without an accent (Walton 
2015) but wage costs are also between 50–80 per cent 
less than in the USA, UK and Canada. In the United 
Kingdom, call centres are staffed by students and tem-
porary workers and are considered to be twenty-first 
century sweatshops with high staff turnover rates and 
low salaries (£12,000–15,000). In India, they are desir-
able places, regarded as ‘hip and funky places to work, 
somewhere to hang out with like-minded, outward-look-
ing young people’ (Spillius 2003: 44). In the 1990s the 
call-centre industry did not exist in India, but by 2003, 
1,500 Indian call-centre providers employed 102,000 
young people in the ‘remote services’ industry; the 
industry is growing by 70 per cent a year (Spillius 2003: 
41). The increasing maturity of the offshoring market is 
seeing growth in the Philippines, Poland, Romania and 
Mexico and the continued existence of small centres 
(Caribbean, Guatemala). Nevertheless, higher-value 
service work, for example mobile app development, 
remains located in developed market economies.
Deciding to offshore a service function is a difficult 
decision. Cost might be the most important driver, 
but for some firms this might mean the provision of 
a less than satisfactory service to clients. There is 
a continual attempt by companies to reduce costs 
and the offshoring of services, at the moment, plays 
an important role in this process and this create dis-
advantages for clients and staff. In 2011 staff at an 
Orange call centre located in England were told that 
they could retain their jobs if they relocated to the 
Philippines (Walton 2015).
Offshoring is a complex process that involves an 
on-going reorganization of the relationship between 
service functions, place and space. The first decade of 
this century was associated with the rise of service off-
shoring. The current decade has seen ‘onshoring’ or the 
return of previously offshored functions to relatively high 
cost locations. In July 2011 Santander, UK, announced 
that it had returned all its call centres in India to the UK 
because of customer complaints. The banks noted that 
customers were frustrated in dealing with offshore call 
centres and that this rapidly turned into dissatisfaction. 
Quality issues have played an important role in the new 
process of ‘return onshoring’. India has also experienced 
higher wage inflation whilst high unemployment rates in 
the UK have increased staff retention and reduced the 
cost differential related to training and wages.

Chapter 17  Service economies, spatial divisions of expertise and the second global shift     355
to distinguish between corporate strategies that affect 
production workers and those that involve expertise or 
forms of creative work. A spatial division of expertise 
distinguishes between the spatial organization of exper-
tise (non-production activities, advanced business and 
professional services (BPS) and management functions) 
and the spatial organization of  production (Bryson 
and Rusten 2005, 2006, 2008). It reflects the distinction 
between production and non-production activities within 
manufacturing (Crum and Gudgin 1977). The concept of 
a spatial division of expertise shifts the focus of analysis 
to the places where expertise is produced and consumed; 
it also exists within and between international business 
service firms and manufacturing firms. The building 
blocks of these ‘expertise’ economic systems are dis­
tributed in a complex mosaic that reflects the ways in 
which all firms (from micro- to large transnational) try to 
maximize profitability. The spatial division of expertise 
is informed by the social division of labour, which gives 
considerable emphasis to relationships between people 
and to the joint supply and co-production of service 
knowledge/expertise.
The development of a spatial division of expertise has 
important implications for the geographies of service 
as well as manufacturing companies (Case study 17.2). 
Companies, and even governments, increasingly develop 
services (as well as products) using production processes 
designed to exploit differential comparative advantages. 
This is not an entirely new process; earlier international 
divisions of labour were based on core countries produc­
ing and exporting manufactured goods whilst peripheral 
countries exported raw materials. This was the first manu­
facturing division of labour, or the first global shift (Dicken 
2015). The evolution into a spatial division of expertise 
came later. The comparative advantage for services is 
derived from a different form of raw material, that is, a 
highly educated and expert labour force and, importantly, 
language skills. It is to the geographies of the new spatial 
division of expertise that we now turn our attention.
Within geography, the division of labour concept is 
traditionally associated with deskilling, branch plants 
of manufacturing companies, and the ongoing develop­
ment of an international division of labour, mostly asso­
ciated with textiles and clothing, automotive, electronics 
and to a much lesser extent services (Dicken 2015). It 
has been noted earlier in this chapter that the services 
literature increasingly emphasizes the importance of 
emotional labour and embodied expertise in service rela­
tionships and production (Hochschild 1983; Fineman 
2000; Warhurst et al. 2000; McDowell 2007, 2009). The 
concept of a spatial division of labour therefore needs 
to accommodate the increasing centrality of embodied 
expertise in the economy (Wellington and Bryson 2001; 
Bryson and Wellington 2003). There has also been a shift 
in the nature of particular forms of work. Some types 
of high-paid work, for example, are moving away from 
delivery by labour that is controlled by capital and regu­
lated by company law to a situation in which control, or 
more correctly power, in the ‘employment’ relationship is 
transferred from the employers to the employed experts. 
These are the most important asset ‘owned’ or managed 
by expertise-intensive firms; such walking, highly mobile 
resources leave their firms’ offices each evening and may, 
or may not, return next morning. This contrasts with 
manufacturing where owners of capital exercise most of 
the power in the relationship with their employees. The 
rise of expertise-intensive occupations has shifted power 
away from employers to employees. Indicative of this 
‘new order’ are the difficulties experienced by firms try­
ing to manage business service professionals and the con­
troversial role of staggered bonus payments and golden 
handcuffs for staff retention in, for example, investment 
banking (Leicht and Fennell 1997; Alvesson 2000).
The spatial division of labour has continued to evolve 
and is increasingly centred on the expertise that is located 
within or outside client companies. This is not to sug­
gest that the spatial division of ‘production’ labour is 
still not important, but it is now conceptually useful

Boeing’s new spatial division 
of expertise
It is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish 
between manufacturing and service companies 
(Daniels and Bryson 2002). Many physical products 
contain embedded services, for example software, or 
are supported by service agreements. The increasing 
symbiosis that is developing between manufacturing 
and services is changing the geographies of produc-
tion in complex ways, creating new business models 
that capitalize on service/manufacturing expertise and 
repositioning expertise as a key source of competitive 
advantage. There are many examples, but perhaps one 
of the most dramatic is found in the aerospace industry. 
In 2002, Boeing, the American manufacturer, began

developing the 787 Dreamliner, a new aircraft with a 
range of 8,500 nautical miles that carries between 200 
and 300 passengers (see Bryson and Rusten 2006, 
2008, 2011). This was in response to airline’s new con-
cern with fuel efficiency rather than extra speed.
For Boeing the Dreamliner manufacturing pro-
gramme represented a new way of designing and 
manufacturing a complicated product that requires an 
extended, complex supply chain. Before the Dream-
liner programme, Boeing followed a build-to-print 
model. Over 1,000 companies in Boeing’s supply chain 
were provided with detailed part specifications and 
they only became involved with the aircraft programme 
towards the end of the design and development pro-
cess. These companies provided parts that Boeing 
assembled into subsystems and then aircraft. In this 
production model, Boeing was responsible for the 
detailed design of the complete plane. For the Dream-
liner, Boeing was responsible for the overall design of 
the plane, for systems integration and final assembly, 
but detailed design work was transferred to a net-
work of global partners. The result was a new spatial 
division of expertise that was constructed around

Chapter 17  Service economies, spatial divisions of expertise and the second global shift     357
capitalizing on Boeing’s own internal design and man-
agement expertise combined with that of its partners 
distributed around the globe. This expertise is a com-
bination of research and development with industrial 
design inputs developed in centres of excellence that 
support high-tech engineering activities. This new spa-
tial division of expertise was based on the recruitment 
of around 50 Tier 1 suppliers or partners and these 
suppliers sourced parts from Tier 2 suppliers that 
included parts from Tier 3 suppliers.
This new model represented a radical alteration to 
the way Boeing designed and manufactured aeroplanes; 
most of the manufacturing was undertaken at factories 
owned and managed by Boeing’s partners; the only 
major part of the Dreamliner’s airframe made by Boeing 
was the vertical tail. Boeing’s key partners include three 
major Japanese manufacturing companies (Kawasaki 
Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Fuji 
Heavy Industries) and Alenia Aeronautica, an Italian 
company. The Japanese companies were responsible 
for the design and production of the Dreamliner’s wings; 
the first time Boeing had outsourced the most important 
part of an aircraft. Initially, the Japanese wing design 
team worked closely with Boeing’s design team and was 
based at Boeing’s Everett facility in Washington State 
(USA). This team then returned to Japan to concentrate 
on the development of the detailed designs for the wing 
while the Boeing design team shifted focus to concen-
trate on systems integration.
In this way the Dreamliner combined Boeing’s ‘ser-
vice’ expertise (design, development, system integra-
tion, project management) with that of its partners. 
Once assembled in the Kawasaki plant the completed 
wing box are transported by barge to Nagoya’s new 
Centrair airport and from there flown to Charleston, 
South Carolina, in modified 747 cargo freighters (Fig-
ure 17.3). Charleston is the main fuselage hub in this 
spatial division of expertise; sections manufactured in 
Japan, Italy and the USA are assembled before being 
flown to Everett for a final assembly process that nor-
mally takes only three days. This is both a conventional 
spatial division of ‘production’ labour, with finished parts 
travelling from one supplier to another down the chain, 
and a spatial division of ‘embodied’ expertise. This is 
an example of an expertise-rich production system 
in which conventional shop-floor manufacturing work-
ers play a relatively minor role. Some 3,600 engineers 
were directly employed by Boeing in the design of the 
Dreamliner, with the majority of these positions based at 
the company’s Everett plant (Washington, USA) (Gates 
2005). A further 670 engineers are employed by Spirit 
Aerosystems, Wichita (Kansas, USA) and 570 in Japan.
The Dreamliner was three years behind schedule 
when it made its first commercial flight in October 2011. 
The development programme was delayed due to dif-
ficulties with the engineering, supply chain problems 
and a 58-day labour strike in 2008. The new production 
process based on global outsourcing (a new global 
production network) proved to be flawed. Some of the 
partners in the Dreamliner’s supply chain experienced 
major capacity problems and there were technical and 
quality difficulties. In 2009, Boeing spent US$1 billion to 
acquire a plant located in North Charleston, SC, owned 
by Vought Aircraft Industries that makes parts for the 
787’s rear fuselage. There had been difficulties with this 
supplier that was causing a bottleneck in the Dream-
liner supply chain. Boeing employed additional staff at 
Everett to overcome many of the difficulties the com-
pany faced as it tried to complete this new aircraft. The 
production of the Dreamliner highlights the importance 
of the interplay that occurs between manufacturing and 
services as companies develop new spatial divisions of 
labour. The Dreamliner’s development programme was 
delayed due to engineering difficulties and problems 
coordinating and managing Boeing’s new approach to 
working with suppliers.
17.5 The second global shift
The traditional view of services is that they were pro­
duced and consumed locally; they were regarded as hav­
ing limited export potential. As we noted earlier in this 
chapter this reflects the way in which services were con­
ceptualized in traditional economic theory. Today, how­
ever, services are exported and companies are increasingly 
adopting business models that involve combining service 
expertise, activities and functions located in different 
parts of the world. In other words, companies are devel­
oping competitive advantage through the development of 
an evolving spatial division of expertise. In the popular 
media or in political accounts this trend is known as ‘ser­
vice offshoring’ (see Case study 17.1), a term developed 
in the Anglo-American context that should be used with 
considerable care. Services can indeed be ‘offshored’ 
but this is a less than helpful and even misleading term 
when applied to the transfer of work from, say, France 
to Eastern Europe. Outsourcing can occur at many dif­
ferent spatial scales – from the local to the international 
whilst the term ‘offshoring’ describes the international 
outsourcing of service functions. Perhaps the best term 
to use would be ‘international outsourcing’ rather than 
offshoring.

358    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
offshore services market would reach US$252 billion in 
2010. This activity is included within commercial services 
exports; the top five exporters in 2013 were the United 
States (14.3 per cent of the world total), the UK (6.3 per 
cent), Germany (6.2 per cent), France (5.1 per cent) and 
China (4.5 per cent). If the European Union is treated as 
single entity then it becomes the top exporter of com­
mercial services (US$891 billion, 25 per cent of the world 
total). The top five importers of commercial services in 
2013 were the United States (9.8 per cent of the world 
total), China (7.5 per cent), Germany (7.2 per cent), 
France (4.3 per cent) and the UK (4.0 per cent) (WTO 
2014: 27).
Service offshoring is not easily analyzed because ser­
vice tasks can be traded in four ways (United Nations 
2002: 1):
Mode 1: cross-border supply occurs when suppliers of 
services in one country supply services to consumers in 
another country without either supplier or consumer 
moving into the territory of the other.
Mode 2: consumption abroad refers to the process by 
which a consumer resident in one country moves to 
another country to obtain a service.
Mode 3: commercial presence occurs when enterprises in 
an economy supply services internationally through the 
activities of foreign affiliates.
Mode 4: presence of natural persons describes the process 
by which an individual moves to the consumer’s country 
to provide a service, whether on his or her own behalf or 
on behalf of his or her employer.
Three of these modes are concerned primarily with 
service transactions between residents and non-residents. 
Mode 1 involves the provision of services that require 
no direct contact with customers but procedures must 
be developed to overcome cultural barriers that exist 
between countries. Recently, there has been a particular 
interest in Mode 3, whereby enterprises supply services 
internationally through the activities of foreign affiliates 
(Bryson et al. 2004). For services, the Mode 3 ‘method of 
serving foreign markets is particularly important because 
it is often the only method that permits the close and 
continuing contact between service providers and their 
customers necessary to compete effectively with indig­
enous firms’ (United Nations 2002a: 54). In this instance 
the provision of services through foreign direct invest­
ment represents a type of captive offshoring or offshoring 
without outsourcing. Captive offshoring enables a firm 
to retain control over its assets, intellectual property and 
core business processes. Trade in services must address 
cultural differences between countries that restrict the 
The concept of service outsourcing emerged during 
the 1990s, but only became of major concern during this 
century. Between January and May 2004, there were 2,634 
reports in American newspapers that focused on service 
outsourcing (Amiti and Wei 2004: 4). Journalists tended 
to focus on the fear of job losses as service outsourcing 
had the potential to strip jobs out of the American labour 
market and relocate them to lower-cost production loca­
tions. Service offshoring is based on the concept of out­
sourcing, a term that describes the process by which a 
firm procures a material or service input from another 
organization.
Service offshoring was made possible by developments 
in ICT. During the late 1980s and early 1990s pioneer 
companies experimented with offshoring service func­
tions on the basis of opportunistic searches to reduce 
costs and also in response to sequential learning (Lewin 
and Peeters 2006). In the early stages, relatively simple 
business processes related to finance, accounting and 
information technologies were offshored. As experi­
ence of offshoring these functions has accumulated, it 
has encouraged firms to include more technically com­
plex processes and higher value-added tasks. Offshoring 
was originally developed by business units within firms 
interested in cutting costs but it has become a stand­
ard business process and another management tool or 
approach sold by management consultancy firms to their 
clients and also heavily marketed by providers of offshore 
services.
Service offshoring occurs when firms shift production 
to foreign locations. The objective may be to reduce costs, 
to service a foreign market, to reduce exposure to coun­
try risk, or to access skilled labour. An additional factor 
influencing the location of offshore service centres is the 
requirement to provide a 24-hour service to customers 
or an extended service beyond standard working hours. 
The cost of providing such services can be high as late-
shift workers expect higher wages or extended ­holidays. 
Advanced call-routing and networking technologies 
­enables companies to mitigate this by implementing a 
‘follow-the-sun’ geographical policy. By locating call 
centres open 8–12 hours per day in widely separated 
time zones, companies can use automatic call routing 
to provide clients with a 24-hour/7-day-a-week service. 
Country risk is removed when a company is able to shift 
the provision of a function between facilities located in 
different countries.
Global data on service offshoring and inshoring is dif­
ficult to find (Amiti and Wei 2004); inshoring describes 
the amount of outsourcing that a country receives. In 
2008, estimates of the size of service offshoring ranged 
from US$101 to US$157 billion (Gereffi and Fernandez-
Stark 2010: 6) and in 2008 the OECD estimated that the 

Chapter 17  Service economies, spatial divisions of expertise and the second global shift     359
not require face-to-face interaction with consumers 
or clients. Second, the inputs and outputs required to 
deliver the service must be capable of being traded or 
transmitted with the assistance of ICT (OECD 2005: 
12). Third, some service activities are not fixed in space 
and can be provided either as a form of foreign trade 
or by the temporary relocation of a service worker to a 
client’s premises, for example management consultancy 
or various forms of auditing. Fourth, specialist services 
can be provided from central locations with consumers 
travelling to avail themselves of the service. In many cases 
such services would be provided within the confines of a 
nation-state, but some are being consumed by a form of 
service-based travel, for example education (secondary 
and tertiary), plastic surgery and a whole range of other 
surgical procedures.
During the 1980s India began to develop capability 
and capacity in the provision of offshore services. It was 
triggered by three events. During the late 1980s some of 
the key chip designers employed by Texas Instruments 
in America were Indian and Texas let them return home 
to work for them from there using early forms of ICT. 
In 1989, Jack Welch, the then Chairman of the Ameri­
can conglomerate General Electric (GE), visited India 
and realized that it offered a pool of talented individu­
als who could be of benefit to GE. A team was sent to 
India and GE set up a joint development project with 
an Indian engineering company, Wipro. Second, during 
the late 1990s the Y2 computer crisis, or the millennium 
bug, provided India with clients interested in computer 
remediation. When computers were originally designed, 
to save memory their clocks used six digits for dates – 
two for the day, two for the month and two for the year. 
When the year 2000 arrived there was a risk that comput­
ers would not recognize it, but would think that it was 
the year 1900. The resulting need for Y2 upgrading was 
tedious work and many American and European compa­
nies commissioned Indian companies for the task. This 
allowed the Indian computer industry to enter the global 
marketplace for the provision of computer services, an 
opportunity they would build upon when the Y2 work 
was replaced by the e-commerce or dot-com boom. The 
dot-com boom led to investment in undersea fibre-optic 
cable, but the dot-com bust that followed meant that the 
cost of using this cable was virtually nil and this vastly 
increased the number of American companies wanting 
to outsource service activities to India (Friedman 2005: 
106–10).
Outsourcing services to companies located in other 
countries comes with a number of risks attached to lan­
guage, culture and the quality of the provided service. 
Unlike the first ‘global shift’, the geography of the sec­
ond global shift is determined by the educational and 
ability of service providers to export standardized ser­
vices. Modes 3 and 4 enable service providers to local­
ize provision to take into consideration local cultures 
and client expectations. Modes 1, 3 and 4 involve what 
is commonly termed ‘service offshoring’ or more cor­
rectly ‘service global sourcing’. This is encapsulated by 
the concept of a ‘second global shift’ (Bryson 2007). 
The first global shift involved the relocation of manu­
facturing employment to low-cost production locations 
while the second implicates services in this process. There 
have been three distinct phases to the second global shift. 
First, during the early 1990s IT programming, testing and 
network support activities were outsourced and then 
globally sourced. Second, during the late 1990s global 
sourcing diversified into the provision of back-office and 
call-centre functions and also the development of com­
puter applications. Third, during the early years of this 
century full service centres emerged that provide a wide 
range of administration, process, contact and support 
functions.
The second global shift highlights the potential for 
transferring service work from developed economies to 
low-cost locations, and it has provoked a major policy 
debate, or even panic, in the USA and Europe (Parker 
2004; Blinder 2006). For example, Forrester (a consul­
tancy company) has estimated that 1.1 million Western 
European jobs will move offshore during 2005–15 and 
that two-thirds of these jobs will originate from the 
United Kingdom (Parker 2004). Perhaps the best estimate 
comes from an analysis of occupational data for several 
OECD countries which suggests that around 20 per cent 
of total service employment has the potential to be geo­
graphically footloose as a result of rapid developments in 
ICT (van Welsum and Reif 2005: 6). Ultimately, the only 
types of service jobs that will be safe are those for which 
face-to-face interaction is absolutely essential (Levy and 
Murnane 2004).
The development of service offshoring represents a 
new type of international division of labour, but with a 
difference. It is various forms of service activity, ranging 
from call-centre-based work to back-office administra­
tion that is being relocated to low-cost locations rather 
than manufacturing or assembly activities. This new form 
of trade involves low-value call-centre-type activities as 
well as high-value services such as legal work, account­
ancy, design, business analysis, and equity research (Table 
17.2). Using high-speed fibre-optic cables and undersea 
telephone lines data scanned in Britain or America is 
transmitted to a low-cost offshore location to be pro­
cessed in back offices or used in call centres.
A number of factors influence the decision to send 
a particular service activity offshore. First, it must be 
capable of some degree of standardization that does 

360    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
language abilities of service workers located in foreign 
locations that may also perhaps, but not always, be lower-
cost locations (Bryson 2007). For the English-speaking 
world this means that potential suppliers must be able to 
provide English-speaking employees in other countries, 
while France, Norway or Sweden, for example, require 
a pool of staff fluent in French, Norwegian or Swedish. 
Language and culture plays a much more important part 
in this global shift than they did during the development 
of an international division of manufacturing labour. 
This means that countries with relatively localized lan­
guages may be protected from the global sourcing of ser­
vices whilst countries with more widely spoken ‘global’ 
languages (such as English, Spanish or French) will 
almost certainly participate in the second global shift. 
Therefore the geography of the second global shift is also 
different from the first; it is more constrained by language 
as well as cultural nearness, that is, the ability of foreign 
service suppliers to relate to customers located in other 
countries (Figure 17.4).
An implication is that countries which developed 
extensive empires during the nineteenth century may have 
inadvertently laid the foundations for the emergence of 
foreign competitors who are able to exploit the benefits 
associated with their acquired or imposed non-native lan­
guage. This is a form of ‘post-colonial twist’ in that the 
various trading and political empires encouraged the use 
of a common language and, in many cases, common legal 
and educational systems (Bryson 2007). It is therefore not 
surprising that countries such as the United Kingdom and 
the United States that are part of a globalized language 
grouping may be most at risk from companies choosing 
to deliver services from lower-cost locations either by 
establishing their own operations via a process of foreign 
direct investment or by subcontracting the activities to a 
third party and often foreign service provider. Whether

this is a ‘real’ threat will depend on whether the avail­
ability of lower-cost services will actually enhance the 
competitiveness of other parts of the developed market 
economies, leading to future innovation and wealth-crea­
tion opportunities. It is also important to remember that 
the second global shift does not just involve the transfer 
of jobs from high- to low-cost economies but it is also 
a two-way process in which service providers based in 
low-cost locations must also establish branch offices in 
developed market economies. Service offshoring is a com­
plex process involving the development of firms that have 
the ability to provide service functions from a number 
of different locations. This type of transnational service 
firm can develop out of the activities of firms located, for 
example, in the United States or United Kingdom (devel­
oped market economies) or in India or China (developing 
or transition economies).
The evolving geography of service offshoring is com­
plex as the geography differs by the task that is offshored 
and by sector. Technological innovations, the Internet, 
and the language and IT skills of the workforce have facil­
itated the offshoring of information technology services. 
The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Information 
and Technology Agreement (ITA) was concluded in 
1996 and this removed duties on IT products included 
in the agreement. The ITA facilitated major growth in 
the export and import of IT services. India has become 
the predominant location for the offshoring of software 
services (Table 17.3). In 2009, India exported US$33 bil­
lion of computer services and other developing countries 
(Philippines, Malaysia and Costa Rica) have experienced 
significant growth in IT exports. The export of IT ser­
vices in some developing countries has been growing at 
much greater rates than developed economies so that 
the Philippines, for example, has experienced dramatic 
growth with IT exports increasing from US$89 million 
in 2005 to US$1.9 billion in 2010; an annual growth rate 
of 85 per cent (WTO 2014: 92)
Service offshoring represents a stage in the evolv­
ing global geography of production. It was driven by 
developments in ICT and also salary differentials. The 
threat of offshoring service jobs from the US and Europe 
exerted a downward pressure on salaries rather than 
leading to major job losses in developed market econo­
mies. Developments in computer coding, new algorithms 
and industrial robots have perhaps displaced many more

call-centre operators in developed market economies that 
service offshoring. In 1998, Jack Welch, the then chief 
executive of General Electric, noted that ‘ideally, you’d 
have every plant you own on a barge to move with cur­
rencies and changes in the economy’ (The Economist 
2013: 11). The factors that influence the location of a 
call centre or any business activity are constantly chang­
ing. Salary differentials narrow and may be replaced 
by a concern with the quality of service provided. In 
2012, KPMG International noted that there was a revo­
lution underway in business services that might mean 
‘the death of outsourcing’ as we know it (Justice 2012). 

Chapter 17  Service economies, spatial divisions of expertise and the second global shift     363
Outsourcing is considered as playing an important role 
in developing new processes and technologies, reducing 
cost, accessing new sources of talent and transforming 
business through working with new partners. Neverthe­
less, KPMG notes that different firms have very differ­
ent attitudes to the provision of services. Some firms 
consider sales and general administration as technical 
necessities that must be managed to reduce costs whilst 
other firms consider these business functions as part of 
a differentiation strategy in the marketplace. This is to 
highlight the important role core services play in build­
ing market share and reflects a shift away from a focus 
just on cost control. Some business activities that used to 
be outsourced and offshored, such as data management 
and the analysis of Big Data are increasingly considered 
to be strategic business processes that are best under­
taken in-house.
The global sourcing or offshoring of services does not 
have to entail the supply of services over large distances. 
It may occur as ‘near-shoring’ or the relocation or provi­
sion of services over short distances and often between 
locations on the same continental land mass (Gál 2009), 
for example the ‘near-shoring’ of American services to 
Canada. Services can now be supplied on-shore, near-
shore and offshore. Presented in this manner these may 
appear as simple alternatives but in many instances firms 
have developed ‘blended delivery systems’ that capitalize 
on the place-based advantages of coupling or blending 
activities located in a variety of different locations: home 
country, near, far (Bryson 2007).
17.6 Conclusion
The history of economic development is one of increased 
economic specialization combined with the development 
of new and often complex geographies. All this repre­
sents and reflects the constant working through of new 
divisions of labour and new ways of maximizing wealth 
creation. The development of service-dominated econ­
omies represents a working through of the division of 
labour but it is worth remembering that it is important 
to differentiate between employment and output. All ser­
vices must be supported by manufactured products and 
all manufactured products are supported by services. 
The implication is that we have an integrated economy 
in which the worlds of production (services and manu­
facturing functions), finance and consumption combine 
to produce local, national and international economies.
The spatial division of expertise and the related second 
global shift continue to evolve and have the potential to 
rework the national and global dynamics of the capitalist 
economic system. Employment that was considered to 
be safe from foreign competition is suddenly exposed to 
business models that operate by blending together differ­
ent forms of expertise related to differential comparative 
advantage. This may enhance productivity improvements, 
leading to new innovations, but it also has the potential 
‘to undermine the service-based solution to the employ­
ment crisis that is still being experienced by many devel­
oped regional economies’ (Bryson 2007).
Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter, you should understand:
● Different ways in which services have been 
defined and conceptualized by economists and 
geographers.
● The concept of a ‘personality market’ or emotional 
labour highlights the importance of embodied 
labour, or skills with people, in the world of service 
work.
● Appreciate that as the United Kingdom and the 
United States became industrialized societies 
they were simultaneously transformed into service 
economies.
● Service economies should not just be identified by 
measuring employment, but should also take into 
consideration gross value added (GVA).
● Economic production is a story of economic 
specialization and the continual reworking of the 
division of labour.
● A spatial division of labour occurs with the geo-
graphical separation of production tasks, for exam-
ple, writing, printing, binding and distributing a book.
● The development of a concept of a spatial division of 
expertise draws attention to the development of new 
corporate strategies that are founded upon exploiting 
comparative advantage based on expertise.
● Different economic geographies can be explained 
by distinctive combinations and patterns of spatial 
divisions of labour and of expertise.
● Services were conventionally conceptualized as local 
untraded activities. The rise of the second global 
shift or service offshoring highlights one of the latest 
developments in the capitalist economic system.

 GEOGRAPHIES OF MONEY, 
FINANCE AND CRISIS 
 Chapter 18 
 Money is simultaneously everything and nothing, everywhere but 
nowhere in particular.
 (david harvey 1985b: 167) 

366    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
T
his chapter explores the social, economic, politi-
cal and geographical attributes of money, finance 
and crisis. Many accounts of money and ‘the global 
financial crisis’ are written by economists or finance 
specialists, who pay little attention to its geographi-
cal anatomy. Is finance something that we should 
think about geographically? Money can certainly 
be placed, whether it’s in your pocket, your bank 
account or in the stock market, but only in the first 
case is your money a physical object. As the Harvey 
quote suggests, money can be a difficult subject and 
many contemporary debates about globalization 
stress the increasingly integrated, global machina-
tions of the financial system in which ‘virtual’ or 
‘digital’ monies can be moved around the globe at 
the touch of a button. One of the purposes of this 
chapter is to persuade you of the existence and 
importance of different geographies of finance that 
together contribute to an understanding of the so-
called ‘global financial crisis’.
Novelists, filmmakers and social theorists alike have 
grappled with money’s contradictory characteristics. 
Money can be everything and nothing, everywhere and 
nowhere; money can be the root of all evil and a source 
of independence and freedom. Even simple questions 
like ‘what is money?’ present some difficulties. Davies 
(1994: 29) suggests that money is ‘anything that is 
widely used for making payments and accounting for 
debts and credits’. Historically, a wide range of items 
including beads, shells, whales’ teeth, cattle, salt, skins, 
tobacco, beer, gold and silver have been used as money. 
Such variation suggests that rather than asking what 
money is, we should perhaps ask what functions does 
money perform? This question reveals the important 
economic functions of money and finance and their 
status as a source of social power. This is illustrated 
through a geographical reading of the financial crisis 
that started in 2007 and ended in . . . well, we are not so 
sure about when the financial crisis ended or will end, 
as it has mutated from a subprime mortgage crisis and 
a foreclosure crisis into a banking crisis, an economic 
crisis, a political crisis, a sovereign debt crisis and a  
euro crisis.
We are used to thinking of money and finance ‘oiling 
the wheels’ of commerce and also being a measure of 
worth or value. Yet these two facets of money and finance 
can be contradictory. As a store of value, it is desirable 
for money to be a stable, fixed representation of value. 
As a medium of circulation and as a form of capital – 
money that is thrown into circulation with the intent of 
generating more money – it is desirable to have money 
freely available as credit, divorced from its moorings in 
the ‘real economy’. As Davies (2002: 30) argues, the his-
tory (and geography) of the evolution of money reveals 
‘unceasing conflict’ between borrowers, keen to expand 
the quantity of money in circulation, and lenders, keen to 
limit the supply of money and, at all costs, preserve the 
quality of monies in circulation. Managing this conflict 
or, more accurately, reacting to financial crises resulting 
from it, has been and still is the mission of various regula-
tory authorities.
18.1 Money and finance in geography
Although we may be used to thinking of money as pri-
marily an economic phenomenon, geographers and other 
social scientists are now recognizing that money is satu-
rated with cultural, social and political significance. In 
this section, we examine some of the social-geographical 
aspects of money. We focus initially on money and power, 
before moving on to consider the financialization of 
society and the geographies that connect individuals and 
groups in different places and times. We also examine 
some of the arguments concerning the globalization of 
money and finance, before outlining some of the prob-
lems with this view.
Many of the social and cultural aspects of money 
are related to its role as ‘the very incarnation of social 
power’ (Harvey 1982: 245). Again, however, we confront 
the contradictory qualities of money. As a means of 
expressing social power money has both desirable and 
less desirable qualities. Leyshon and Thrift (1997) talk 
of two discourses about money: one of suspicion and 
one of liberation.
To understand the discourse of suspicion, we can 
turn to the work of Georg Simmel (1978: 277), for whom 
money is ‘the most perfect representation’ of the ten-
dency to reduce quality to quantity. As a store of value 
and unit of account money transforms social relations – 
­qualitatively different commodities and experiences – into 
an abstract quantity, namely their price. In contemporary 
capitalism, money has become the mediator and regula-
tor of economic relations between individuals, a meas-
ure of wealth and a means of expressing social power. 
All manner of social, political and cultural issues – from 
healthcare, housing, education, leisure and sports, the 
environment, and so forth – are debated not in terms 
of what they are worth, but in terms of how much they 
are worth in the sense of what can be afforded. Money 
‘affects our very ideals of what is good and beautiful 
and true’ (Mitchell 1937: 371). Money, in this sense, has 
­corroded the importance of other meanings and meas-
ures of ‘value’.

Chapter 18  Geographies of money, finance and crisis     367
18.1.1 Global monies?
Many geographers, particularly those working in a 
political economy tradition, have argued that capital-
ism appears to be speeding up and spreading out (Harvey 
1989; Massey 1994). Capitalism is seen to be spreading 
out in that more people in different countries and regions 
are becoming bound up with the logics of contemporary 
capitalism. It is also speeding up in that the pace of life 
seems to be increasing in different parts of the globe. 
In Spotlight box 18.1, we noted the ability of money to 
transform qualitatively different commodities and expe-
riences into an abstract quantity, a price. This has led 
many theorists to argue that money is a vehicle for the 
homogenization of space, for making different spaces 
more similar. While there are ongoing debates about the 
extent to which capitalism is generating a global culture 
(see Chapter 13), it is difficult to argue with the conten-
tion that financial markets in different countries have, 
Yet there is also a discourse of liberation that accom-
panies money. First, money provides a degree of individu-
ality, freedom, security and independence for those that 
hold it. This is especially true in societies like the UK 
where laws regarding private property buttress ideologies 
of liberty, equality and freedom. The idea that money is 
empowering and liberating is central to the desire to pos-
sess money, to work for it, to accept it as payment and to 
save and invest it. Second, as Simmel (1991: 20) argues, 
money ‘creates an extremely strong bond among mem-
bers of an economic circle’; people have far more connec-
tions to other people in modern, monetized societies than 
was the case in feudal society. Through the division of 
labour in capitalist societies (see Chapter 2), money links 
people together in offices, factories, homes and shopping 
malls in different parts of the world. Money may in some 
senses be corrosive of social bonds, but it also creates 
a community that can forge new connections and hold 
people together.
Spotlight box 18.1
The functions of money
● Money is a unit of  account: it is the base of 
­economic accounting systems.
● Money is a measure of  value: it is the commodity 
against which the values of other commodities can 
be calibrated and compared on the same scale.
● Money is a store of  value, in that you can sell a 
good for a certain amount of money and then use 
that money to buy something else at a later date. 
Money thus allows for the separation of the sale 
and purchase of commodities over space and 
time if it is a reliable store of value. Preserving this 
­ability of money to store value is one of the reasons  
why governments are so concerned about the 
­phenomenon of inflation.
● Money is a medium of  exchange and circulation.
● Money is a means of  payment and a standard for 
deferred payments.
These different functions of money often come into con-
flict with each other. As a store of value, governments, 
firms and individuals alike want monies to maintain their 
value and hence their purchasing power, between differ-
ent times and spaces. As a medium of circulation, how-
ever, it is important for money to be extended as credit.
Banks create credit – and thereby money – by 
extending loans to individuals, firms, governments 
and . . . each other. During economic growth, there is 
temptation for banks and other lending institutions to 
create large volumes of credit. Any sudden loss of con-
fidence in the quality of credit, as happened in the Wall 
Street Crash of 1929 (see Plate 18.1) or in the recent 
global financial crisis (from 2007), can trigger financial 
panics and devaluation as depositors, investors and 
financial institutions flee from credit moneys and seek 
out safer havens.
Plate 18.1  The Wall Street Crash 1929: the stock 
market collapse of October 1929 brought the 1920s 
boom to an end and led to widespread bank failures, 
bankruptcies and drastic reduction in the availability 
of credit.
(Bettmann/Corbis)

368    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
We could extend the example by thinking through how 
job losses in any other place would also have been felt by 
those not in paid work. For those in households depend-
ent on the wages of someone made redundant there 
would be further belt-tightening or a search for alterna-
tive sources of income. For the unemployed, job losses in 
the area might mean more competition for any new jobs 
that are created and so forth.
18.1.2 Forces for globalization and financialization
The organization of monies into different financial mar-
kets can appear dauntingly complex. In addition to the 
financial jargon describing different products and mar-
kets, the ‘global financial system’ can sometimes seem 
like something ‘out there’, a fast-moving, volatile ‘thing’, 
running out of control, increasingly uncoupled from the 
‘real’ economy and operating beyond the regulatory 
reach of any one nation-state (Langley 2003). This global 
sense of money and finance can be difficult to grasp and 
sometimes it is difficult to understand just how its machi-
nations affect us. For example, how did the US housing 
and subprime mortgage crisis that started in 2007 change 
the lives of people not only in the United States, but also 
in other continents (see Section 18.2)?
The global financial crisis is often framed as one 
caused by unscrupulous financial practices in both 
the global financial command and control centres 
(­London, New York and so forth) and the daily life of 
consumer banks and their customers. There is a feel-
ing that finance is now playing a bigger part in both the 
economy at large (the Economy with a capital ‘E’, that 
is measured in ‘gross domestic products’, stock indices 
and other statistics) and the economy of daily life (the 
many economies with a lowercase ‘e’, i.e. how individu-
als and households go about in their personal lives) have 
become more financialized. The burgeoning literature on 
financialization tries to answer the who, what, how, why, 
when and where questions of the presumed financializa-
tion of the E/­economies. Financialization can be defined 
as ‘the increasing dominance of financial actors, markets, 
practices, measurements and narratives, at various scales, 
resulting in a structural transformation of economies, 
firms (including financial institutions), states and house-
holds’ (Aalbers 2015).
The ‘-ation’ part of financialization suggests that 
it is not a state or end result but an action, something 
that is produced. Many financialization scholars situ-
ate the beginning of this most recent bout of financiali-
zation in the 1970s with the rise of neoliberalism (see 
 ­Chapter 8), the crisis of Fordist capitalism in the West (see  
­Chapter 3), the breakdown of the Bretton Woods sys-
tem (see Section 18.1.3) and other developments. Others 
since the mid-1970s, become more interconnected (Har-
vey 1989; Martin 1994) and homogeneous.
When we talk about the globalization of finance, how-
ever, we are talking about more than just the growth of 
international financial transactions, or the growing pres-
ence of multinational companies in domestic financial 
markets. Globalization implies:
a strong degree of integration between the different 
national and multinational parts . . . the emergence 
of truly transnational banks and financial compa-
nies . . . that integrate their activities and transac-
tions across different national markets. And above 
all, it [globalization] refers to the increasing freedom 
of movement, transfer and tradability of monies and 
finance capital across the globe, in effect integrating 
national markets into a new supranational system.
(Martin 1994: 256)
The emergence of this supranational system coincides 
with the increasing difficulties faced by nationally based 
regulatory authorities like the Bank of England or the 
US Federal Reserve. The ‘discourse of suspicion’ we men-
tioned earlier rears its head in many popular represen-
tations of ‘global finance’ as a ‘global financial casino 
staffed by faceless bankers and hedge fund speculators 
who operate with a herd mentality in the shadowy world 
of global finance (Korten 1998: 4). This kind of discourse 
was also prevalent in the UK in 2008: Alex Salmond, First 
Minister of Scotland, argued that ‘spivs and speculators’ 
were putting ‘the quality of life and jobs of hundreds, 
thousands and millions of people across the world at risk 
through “short-trading”’ – where investors make money 
by betting that the price of shares in a company will fall 
(cited in McIntosh and Maddox 2008). Whether or not 
you agree with these views, it is true that the degree of 
integration of the financial system profoundly shapes 
and connects the lives of people thousands of miles away 
from each other. In this sense, Leyshon (1995) talks of 
money being able to ‘shrink’ space and time, bringing 
some (but not other) parts of the globe relatively closer 
together through the working of financial markets. A 
good example of this is considered in Case study 18.1, 
which describes how the fates of property developers in 
Bangkok (Thailand) ultimately affected the fortunes of a 
bartender, Graham Jones, in Whitley Bay (UK). The fates 
of individuals and companies in Britain and Thailand 
are connected through the workings of foreign exchange 
markets that, in turn, link national currencies to the com-
petitiveness of different nation-states.
This example highlights only some of the interconnec-
tions between changes in the value of the Thai baht and 
how these affected businesses across Asia and Europe. 

Chapter 18  Geographies of money, finance and crisis     369
to some scholars, we have been here before, e.g. in the 
run-up the 1929 Wall Street Crash that was followed by 
the 1930s depression, and financialization thus should be 
understood as a recurrent phase in capitalist development 
(Arrighi 1994).
To illustrate the financialization argument, differ-
ent authors cite different statistics to show that a whole 
range of financial markets have grown rapidly since the 
1970s. In the USA finance has become the dominant 
source of profits since the 1990s (Krippner 2011), but 
this can be witnessed in most OECD countries. For 
the EU27, Eurostat (2011) has calculated that the FIRE 
have pointed at financial deregulation and the associated 
changes on Wall Street and the City of London in the 
1980s, including technological developments (see below) 
and the growing volumes of money that pension funds 
seek to invest. The decline of communism and the fall of 
the USSR (see Chapter 3) at the end of that decade are 
also mentioned as contributing factors, in part because 
they discredited non-capitalist alternatives and under-
wrote how neoliberal and financial discourses became 
dominant (Aalbers 2015). More generally speaking, 
financialization is part of and key to structural trans-
formations of advanced capitalist economies. According

From Bangkok to Whitley Bay . . .
1 Devaluation in Thailand, July 1997
In 1997, several property companies collapsed 
in Thailand; property prices and the stock market 
started to fall. Currency speculators, already nervous 
about slowing growth in the region, started to sell the 
baht (Thai currency) as they expected the currency 
to be devalued. In July, the baht was devalued. As 
a result, Thai exports became cheaper and, to stay 
competitive, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea and 
the Philippines allowed their currencies to fall sharply. 
Some Korean firms who needed foreign currency 
to pay off loans started dumping cheap microchips, 
forcing microchip prices down from US$10 a unit to 
US$1.50.
2 Factory closure in North Tyneside,  
UK, 31 July 1997
Rapidly falling semiconductor prices meant losses 
of £350 million for German electronics company 
Siemens. Siemens semiconductors were produced 
at plants in Tyneside (UK), Taiwan, Germany, France 
and the USA. Managers in Munich announced plans 
to close their £1.1 billion plant in North Tyneside 
that employed 1,100 people and had opened only in 
1994.
3 The cleaning company
The Siemens factory provided 10 per cent of 
­business in the North East for Mitie, a cleaning 
­company. One-third of the workforce of 90 people 
were facing redundancy and their boss had his salary 
bonus cut 10 per cent, in line with the loss of work 
from Siemens.
4 The hotel
Siemens and its contractors, like Mitie, were the ­single 
biggest sources of business for the Stakis Hotel. 
The hotel responded to the closure by switching their 
market focus. As the flow of German executives and 
their UK contractors slowed and then ceased, the hotel 
sought to attract more families.
5 The taxi firm
Foxhunters, a taxi firm, had a contract with Siemens 
that generated more than a dozen runs a day, usually 
to the Stakis Hotel, the airport or the university. Since 
August, Siemens business had dried up and 85 ­drivers 
were chasing work for 50. Despite working longer 
hours, drivers’ takings were down by between £100 
and £200 a week. Drivers started to economize by 
bringing in their own lunches and by cutting down their 
trips to the local pub.
6 The local pub
Takings at Cameron’s had fallen by £600 a week since 
August. The landlord, who blamed the Siemens shut-
down for the reduced trade, cut his opening hours. 
Attempts to drum up more trade by price reductions 
had little effect. The landlord was hoping for more 
­business around Christmas. He and his partner had 
less money for spending on their leisure activities, 
which included visiting places like Whitley Bay.
7 Graham Jones, bartender in Whitley Bay,  
October 1998
Graham was fired from his job at a pub in Whitley Bay; 
there was not enough business to occupy two bartenders 
in the public bar.

to firms and consumers. Online providers, without the 
costs of maintaining the bricks and mortar associated 
with a high street presence, provide insurance, banking, 
pension and other financial products to firms and con-
sumers with access to Internet technologies.
Third, and closely related to developments in tech-
nology, there have been innovations in tradable financial 
products that have made it easier and faster to move 
money around the globe. Derivatives are one example 
of this kind of innovation. Derivatives are contracts 
between two entities that specify rights/obligations based 
on (hence ‘derived’ from) the performance of some other 
currency, commodity or service. They often include 
swaps, options, futures and mortgage-backed ­securities 
(see also Section 18.2.2 and Spotlight box 18.4). They 
can be used to hedge against risk, or to provide leverage. 
In the 1970s, financial derivatives were created to allow 
financial managers to deal with currency risk, but since 
that time they have become increasingly sophisticated 
and extended to more markets. Since 1997, for exam-
ple, energy suppliers, transport agencies, construction 
companies, wine bar owners and other firms exposed to 
weather risk (the possibility that weather could have an 
adverse impact on their profits and cash flow) have been 
able to purchase weather derivatives contracts to protect 
themselves against this risk (Pollard et al. 2008). With this 
extension, however, there has been the proliferation of 
purely speculative trading of such financial instruments – 
and the development of other much more complex con-
tracts. The derivatives’ market has grown exponentially 
between 1990, when the market was almost too small to 
measure, and 2006 when the number of outstanding con-
tracts added up to US$370 trillion (BIS 2008).
Innovations in computing and software technologies 
and in financial instruments are fundamental to argu-
ments about the growing financialization of the economy 
alluded to earlier; this is an argument that asserts that 
the speculative accumulation of capital has become an 
end in itself in contemporary capitalism, that the finan-
cial system has come to feed on itself, so to speak, rather 
than supporting firms and industries and other elements 
of the ‘real’ economy (Strange 1999). Round the clock 
trading of financial instruments in different places and 
time zones opens up opportunities for speculation and 
arbitrage, which is the ability to profit from small differ-
ences in price when the same financial product is being 
traded on more than one market. One indicator of how 
growth in the international financial system is outpac-
ing the growth of the ‘real’ economy is provided by for-
eign exchange trading data. According to the Bank for 
International Settlements the daily turnover of foreign 
exchange trading in 1973 was US$10–20 billion, roughly 
twice the amount necessitated by world trade. By 2004, 
(finance, insurance and real estate) sectors together con-
tributed 29 per cent to GDP. Even in Germany, which is 
often said to have a less financialized economy, the FIRE 
sectors contributed more to GDP than manufacturing 
(30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively). Financial assets 
held by institutional investors as a percentage of GDP 
grew rapidly in all OECD countries and now represent 
more than 200 per cent in countries like the USA and 
UK and around 100 per cent in countries like Germany 
and France, increasing three- (US) to tenfold (France) 
between 1980 and 2001 (Deutschmann 2011). By con-
trast, the wage share of national income has fallen across 
the board, although less so in countries with strong 
labour unions (Epstein and Jayadev 2005). Geographers 
have repeatedly stressed that financialization is an inher-
ently spatial phenomenon that should be much more cen-
tral to economic geographic analysis. Local, national and 
macro-regional institutions act as filters of how finan-
cialization plays out and is perceived.
How has this financialization of the economy and glo-
balization of money come about? There is a range of fac-
tors to consider here. First, through the 1980s and 1990s, 
different governments and international institutions, like 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have pursued 
neoliberal, free market policies and encouraged the dereg-
ulation of financial markets (by eliminating exchange and 
capital controls) and the liberalization of flows of capital 
across national borders.
Second, there have been advances in telecommuni-
cations and computing technologies. Computers have 
transformed payments systems. For hundreds of years, 
payments and transfers of money were completed in 
cash – coins and notes – and written down in ledgers. 
Coins and notes were superseded by cheques that in turn 
have been superseded by electronic monies that can be 
moved around the world at the speed of light. Semicon-
ductor chips in computers mean that consumers in many 
countries can use credit and debit cards to pay for goods. 
In some countries, computer chips are now embedded 
in plastic ‘smart’ cards to allow the use of ‘electronic’ 
or ‘digital money’, or, more accurately, electronic rep-
resentations of currencies, to pay for groceries, public 
transport or lunch at the university cafeteria. Finally, 
there are the systems of communication, using earth-
orbiting satellites, that are integral to the operation of 
computing systems, e-mail, the Internet and other forms 
of communication that are used by banks, governments 
and other financial players. These innovations have made 
24-hour trading possible as high-speed computers link 
stock markets in different countries. New communica-
tions and software technologies have also spawned the 
proliferation of financial websites, information providers 
and intermediaries able to provide financial information

18.1.3 Debunking global monies
A rather different departure point for talking about the 
‘globalization of finance’ is to argue that the financial 
system is not really global at all, that it is more like 
a web of connections between different financial sys-
tems, some of which are bound together more tightly 
than others. This argument has developed because the 
idea of a ‘global financial system’ is problematic for 
several reasons.
The first problem stems from the simple observation 
that ‘global finance’ is largely the province of North 
America, Europe and parts of Asia, most notably Japan, 
Hong Kong, Singapore and, more recently, China; it is 
an idea centred on the experiences of the West. Many 
parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America are not only not 
included in ‘the global financial system’; they are being 
actively excluded as banks refuse to lend money until out-
standing debts have been repaid. There is what Massey 
(1993) describes as power geometry at work when some 
commentators describe the financial system as ‘global’. 
For some financial workers in New York, London, and 
Tokyo, international finance may be regarded as ‘global’ 
in the sense that all countries and regions of the globe 
deemed creditworthy and capable of producing profits 
have been included; sub-Saharan Africa, however, ceases 
to exist in such a conception of ‘the global’.
Second, and resulting from this geographical concen-
tration of the management of ‘global finance’ in North 
America, Europe and parts of Asia, some currencies cir-
culate more widely and have greater spatial reach than 
others. The Japanese yen, the euro and most especially 
the US dollar are very useful in international markets 
because they are accepted as forms of payment, unlike, 
for example, Indian rupees. For that reason, the US dollar 
daily trade in foreign exchange averaged US$1.9 trillion, 
roughly ninety five times that necessitated by world trade. 
By April 2010, daily trading volumes had reached US$4 
trillion (www.bis.org/publ/rpfx10.htm). For individual 
consumers with access to the appropriate technology 
there are now on-line financial bookmakers encouraging 
clients to enjoy spread betting (and possibly tax-free prof-
its) on price movements of stocks, stock indices, curren-
cies, interest rates, commodities and even house prices.
These, then, are some of the ways in which money has 
become more global since the 1970s. But what motivates 
such changes? What motivates the implementation of ‘free 
market’ policies, the development of new technologies and 
financial instruments like derivatives? For those working 
in a political economy tradition, like David Harvey (1989), 
the motivation for these changes is the search for profit. 
Capitalism is fundamentally about the accumulation of 
surplus. Competition drives capitalists to seek out new 
markets, new products and to reduce the turnover time of 
capital (see Spotlight box 18.2). In different parts of the 
globe, finance is the language through which the impera-
tives of capitalism are being communicated.
So, there is a very strong economic rationale for the glo-
balization of money. And it is difficult to argue with the 
contention that money has become more globalized since 
the 1970s, that it has, increasingly, connected people in dis-
tant places and homogenized financial space. For Richard 
O'Brien (1992) the growth of the international financial 
system is tantamount to ‘the end of geography’, the notion 
that geography is becoming relatively less important 
because money, in its different forms, is able to overcome 
the friction of distance and link distant places together. 
Others argue that this view is too simple, that geography 
remains critical to our understanding of global finance. We 
now turn to consider these views in more detail.
Spotlight box 18.2
The circulation of money as capital
In capitalist societies, the circulation of money as capital 
is as follows. From left to right in the equation, money (M) 
is invested by producers to purchase commodities (C), 
namely labour power (LP) and the means of production 
(MP), say pieces of wood and wood-cutting machinery. 
Labour power and the means of production are com-
bined in production (P) to make more commodities (C′), 
in this example, let us say chairs, which are then sold 
for more money (M′) than was originally invested (M).
M S C S {LP}
{MP}  S P S C′ S M′ S . . .
The purpose of production in capitalist societies is 
to produce profit and accumulate capital. The turnover 
time of  capital is the amount of time it takes for money 
to complete this circuit. The shorter the turnover time, 
the more often money can be lent out and the more profit 
can be made. Producers therefore have a very strong 
incentive to, where possible, reduce the turnover time 
of capital; time is money.

372    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
are motivated by ecological concerns, the desire for com-
munity development and social cohesion, and the desire 
to construct alternative local economic geographies as a 
form of resistance against the global spread of capitalism 
(Lee 2000).
Third, as Martin (1999b: 6) argues, for all the talk 
of ‘global finance’, there remain different geographical 
circuits of  money that form the ‘wiring’ of an econ-
omy, along which ‘currents’ of wealth, consumption and 
power are conveyed. He identifies four geographies of 
money: locational, institutional, regulatory and public. 
The locational geography refers to the location of differ-
ent financial institutions and markets. Financial institu-
tions and specialized functions (like foreign exchange 
markets) tend to be agglomerated in large urban centres, 
with London, New York and Tokyo sitting at the top 
of the global hierarchy. Different countries also have 
different institutional geographies, in that they organ-
ize their financial institutions and markets in distinct 
ways. In parts of Asia, Latin America and Africa, banks 
and other community-based financial institutions like 
Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCAs) 
(see Spotlight box 18.3) are important in organizing and 
funding economic activity. ROSCAs take different forms 
in different regions and vary with the class, gender and 
ethnicity of their members (Ardener and Burman 1995). 
One of the attractions of ROSCAs for men and women 
in Ghana and elsewhere is the speed with which news of 
hardship or an emergency can be spread, and the order 
of rotation of the fund changed, to help out a member 
in trouble (Ardener 1995).
is also the most popular as a global reserve currency, that 
is, as a store of value (see Spotlight box 18.1). Histori-
cally, the country that occupies a dominant economic 
and political position has underwritten the soundness of 
the international financial system and had its currency 
accepted internationally as the currency in which com-
modity prices are quoted and payments made. Before 
the Second World War, Britain and the pound sterling 
fulfilled this role; after the Bretton Woods conference in 
1944, the US dollar became the key international cur-
rency. More recently, as the economic dominance of the 
USA has declined, the yen, the euro and the Chinese ren-
minbi have become relatively more important in interna-
tional markets.
So, some currencies, like the US dollar, are truly 
international while some others are national. There are 
estimated to be over 4,000 local currencies in operation 
around the globe that facilitate exchange only within very 
specific spatial and social contexts. For example, Local 
Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) are associations whose 
members list their services needed/offered in a directory 
and trade with each other in a local unit of currency; 
for example, ‘bobbins’ in Manchester and ‘solents’ in 
Southampton (Williams 1996). Since their establishment 
in Canada in 1983, LETS schemes have spread to Europe, 
Australia, New Zealand and North America, allowing 
members not only access to credit, but also the chance to 
engage in productive activity to earn such credit. Some 
local currency schemes are devised in times of hardship to 
allow local people to trade goods and services when they 
are unemployed and have little money. Other schemes 
Spotlight box 18.3
Rotating Savings and Credit  
Associations (ROSCAs)
A ROSCA is ‘an association formed upon a core of par-
ticipants who agree to make regular contributions to a 
fund which is given, in whole or in part, to each con-
tributor in turn’ (Ardener 1995: 1). ROSCAs are known 
by different names, depending on their form and scale, 
the social classes of their members and their location. 
In South India they are known as kuris, chitties or chit 
funds, in Cameroon as njangis or tontines, and in Suri-
name as kasmoni, a word probably derived from ‘cash 
money’.
ROSCAs were well developed in China, India, Viet-
nam and parts of West Africa and the Caribbean by 
the end of the nineteenth century. Variants of ROSCAs 
also existed in Scotland and parts of northern England. 
Members, usually ranging in number from a few to sev-
eral hundreds, make regular contributions, in cash or in 
kind, to a fund. The fund, or part of it, is then given to 
each member in turn, depending on age, kinship senior-
ity, or by rules established by the organizer.
In addition to encouraging regular savings and pro-
viding small-scale capital and credit for their members, 
many ROSCAs have strong moral and social dimensions. 
Trust, social solidarity and responsibility are emphasized 
and members have an interest in ensuring that no mem-
ber defaults on regular payment. Some ROSCAs are 
women-only and their potential to empower women, by 
giving them greater control over income and credit, has 
attracted the attention of anthropologists, sociologists 
and feminists (see Ardener and Burman 1995).

Chapter 18  Geographies of money, finance and crisis     373
perspective, to arrive at a geographical understanding of 
the global financial crisis. The concepts of globalization 
and financialization that were discussed in the previous 
section are central to such a geographical understanding. 
We start in the USA where local housing problems turned 
into a national crisis, that then became a trigger for the 
global financial, economic and political crisis.
18.2.1 Subprime lending in the United States
Real estate (houses, offices, factories, malls, etc.) is, by 
definition, local as it is spatially fixed. Mortgage lend-
ing, however, has developed from a local to a national 
market and is now increasingly a global market. An 
understanding of the financial crisis is ultimately a spa-
tialized understanding of the linkages between local and 
global. Housing bubbles, faltering economies and regula-
tion together have shaped the geography of the financial 
crisis on the state and city level in the USA. Subprime 
and predatory lending have affected low-income and 
minority communities more than others and we therefore 
not only see a concentration of foreclosures, or property 
repossessions, in certain cities, but also in certain neigh-
bourhoods (Aalbers 2009; Immergluck 2009).
The default and foreclosure crisis that was at the root 
of the financial crisis has hit US households across the 
country, but people in some states and cities are more 
likely to be in foreclosure (see Case study 18.2). The rise 
in default rates started some years ago in the American 
Rustbelt (the North-east and Mid-west of the USA, 
regions most heavily affected by deindustrialization 
processes) where housing prices went down and unem-
ployment went up. The combination of lack of employ-
ment and falling housing prices is perilous. People who 
lose their job in an area of high unemployment not only 
have a smaller chance of finding a new job within a few 
months, but they also more likely to be unable to pay off 
their mortgage loan and might then be faced with nega-
tive equity, a situation that occurs when the amount 
of the outstanding loan is larger than the market value 
of the house for which the loan is provided. As a result 
lenders will see higher foreclosures as a direct result of 
default, compounded by the fact that homeowners with 
financial problems in declining housing markets are less 
likely to sell their house which would have enabled them 
to pay off their loan.
The rise of subprime lending started in the early 
1990s, often in the poorer parts of Rustbelt cities. 
Increasing default rates led to a first subprime mortgage 
crisis in 1997–8, ten years before the second subprime 
crisis (Ashton 2009; Immergluck 2009). Subprime mort-
gage lending had been growing fast, from about US$35 
billion (5 per cent of total mortgage originations) in 
These varied institutional geographies are products, in 
turn, of contrasting regulatory geographies. There are a 
wide range of supranational, national and regional reg-
ulatory agencies that govern the workings of financial 
institutions and markets. As Martin (1999b: 9) observes,
[M]oney has had a habit of seeking out geographical 
discontinuities and gaps in these regulatory spaces, 
escaping to places where the movement of financial 
assets is less constrained, where official scrutiny into 
financial dealing and affairs is minimal.
Offshore financial centres like the Bahamas, Cayman 
Islands, Jersey and Guernsey are attractive because of 
their low tax rates and minimal regulation. But countries 
like Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the Nether-
lands are also key centres in moving money around the 
world in order to minimize tax payments. Some of that 
behaviour is legal, but some of it is illegal.
Finally, when Martin (1999b) discusses public geogra-
phies, he refers to the role of states in distributing monies 
across regions in the form of goods and services, infra-
structure, health, education and so forth, and in trans-
ferring monies in the form of various social and welfare 
programmes.
18.2 The global financial crisis
The financial crisis that started in 2007–8 and continues 
to drag on and mutate in various ways and places can be 
characterized as a global crisis since it affects most sec-
tors of the economy and most places around the world 
(Aalbers 2009). The fact that one can mention sectors or 
places that are not affected much by the crisis, should not 
be seen as proof that this is not a global crisis. It is merely 
proof that some sectors and places have not yet been fully 
integrated into the global capitalist system or that they 
are not seen as safe havens to switch investment to. This 
is ‘only’ the third global crisis of capitalism; it follows 
the 1930s Depression (with the Second World War as its 
aftermath) and the post-1973 crisis that had been build-
ing up throughout the 1960s. The current global crisis 
was the culmination of various economic disruptions 
throughout the 1990s and early 2000s; these included 
more localized events such as the first subprime crisis in 
the late 1990s in the USA, the late 1990s Asian and Rus-
sian financial crises, the Argentine crisis at the dawn of 
the new millennium, and the explosion of the dot-com 
bubble in the early 2000s.
This section discusses the global financial crisis from 
a geographical perspective. We look at it not only from 
an economic but also from urban and political geography 

374    Section 4  Production, exchange and consumption
Subprime lending is often defined as lending to a bor-
rower with poor credit, but this would be a misrepre-
sentation of the essence of subprime lending, which is 
lending at higher fees and interest rates whether or not 
the borrower actually has bad credit (Aalbers 2012a). 
Some estimates suggest that more than half of the 
subprime loans went to prime borrowers (Brooks and 
Simon 2007).
Housing prices can go down because of structural 
stresses in economies such as those of the Rustbelt, but 
also because they have been growing rapidly in the way 
typical of many cities in the Sunbelt. Housing prices in 
the Sunbelt were simply more inflated than elsewhere in 
the USA: the housing bubble was bigger and more likely 
to burst. However, some local and regional economies 
in the Sunbelt also showed signs of a declining economy. 
1994 to US$600 billion (20 per cent) in 2006 (Avery et 
al. 2006), 75 per cent of which was securitized (see Spot-
light box 18.4). The growth of subprime lending halted 
for a few years in the late 1990s as a response to the first 
subprime crisis, but picked up again after 2000 when 
subprime loans were no longer exclusively targeted at 
borrowers with low credit scores but re-designed to be 
sold to middle-class borrowers, in particular in the Sun-
belt, i.e. the South and South-west of the USA, regions 
that had seen above-average economic growth since the 
1970s. As a result, the fastest increases in defaults and 
foreclosures since 2007 were not in the Rustbelt but in 
the Sunbelt where housing prices had been rising fast-
est and subprime loans were more common. In Nevada 
and a few other states subprime loans accounted for 
more than 30 per cent of the loans originated in 2006. 
Case study 18.2 
Foreclosure cities and neighbourhoods 
in the USA
Up to 2006, the top ten foreclosure cities almost 
exclusively consisted of Rustbelt cities. In 2007, when 
the crisis started, the list was a mix of Rustbelt and 
Sunbelt cities, but since 2008, the top ten foreclosure 
cities is entirely made up of Sunbelt cities, although 
Rustbelt city Detroit occasionally makes it back to the 
top ten. There are several such foreclosure lists and 
they look slightly different, but generally speaking cities 
in California made up more than half of them between 
2008 and 2010. Since 2011, cities in Florida have 
increasingly taken the lead. The differences across the 
USA are huge: in 2008, at the height of the foreclosure 
crisis, the foreclosure rate in Stockton, CA – the ‘fore-
closure capital’ – was almost 100 times as high as in 
Richmond, VA (Aalbers 2009). Although some cities in 
the Sunbelt are now hit harder than those in the Rust-
belt, on a neighbourhood level the Rustbelt still tops 
the foreclosure lists. On the list of most foreclosed zip 
codes, four are now in Detroit, while the Slavic Village 
in Cleveland has the most foreclosure filings. From 
the 1950s onwards, redlining and suburbanization 
(see Chapter 3) hit this neighbourhood hard. Due to 
a combined economic and foreclosure crisis, demand 
for housing has fallen so dramatically that one can 
now buy many homes in the Slavic Village for under 
US$30,000; on eBay you could even buy one for less 
than US$5,000. The Slavic Village, now referred to 
as foreclosure’s ground zero, has also seen a rapid 
increase in crime (Christie 2007).
Subprime, and in particular predatory, loans fre-
quently result in mortgage foreclosures at the individual 
level and housing abandonment at the neighbourhood 
level (Immergluck 2009; Squires 2004). It is not just 
defaulting borrowers that are hit; in addition, there are 
severe spillover effects on housing prices, crime and 
neighbourhood decline. Besides borrowers and neigh-
bourhoods, cities are also hit hard because their tax 
income goes down in line with property foreclosures 
and lower real estate prices, while their expenses 
increase as a result of foreclosures and property 
crime (Dymski 2010; Immergluck 2009). Local govern-
ments around the USA have cut expenditures on edu-
cation, infrastructure and social services. The public 
school system in California alone faces a loss of US$4 
billion in funding in 2009. Many cities in these states, 
but also in countless others, are facing lower incoming 
taxes (in particular real estate taxes) and cuts in fund-
ing of schools, social services, garbage collection, infra-
structure, etc. One complication in the USA is that local 
governments as well as many states are not allowed 
to run a deficit. While the national government tries to 
stimulate the economy by spending more, municipali-
ties and many states that are faced with decreasing 
revenues also have to cut back on expenses. This is a 
significant development. State revenues in New York, 
a state that in no way presents a worst-case scenario, 
went down 36 per cent in one year (fiscal year 2007–8).

Chapter 18  Geographies of money, finance and crisis     375
lending. As Wyly et al. (2009) have shown, states like 
North Carolina, New Mexico, Massachusetts and West 
Virginia regulate a wide range of practices related to 
foreclosure rules, prepayment penalties and other things. 
New Mexico, for example, introduced the Home Loan 
Protection Act (2003).
Furthermore, high economic growth equated with a high 
rate of new construction and more homeowners who had 
recently bought a house, thereby increasing the pool of 
possible victims of falling housing prices. Finally, several 
states in the USA have tightened their own regulations 
in an effort to minimize the many excesses of subprime

Securitization
● Securitization is the process of transforming 
localized, non-standard and opaque assets like 
mortgages into transparent and liquid securities 
that people can easily exchange on global markets. 
Securitization is designed to reduce the uncer-
tainty of buying and selling atypical assets (leases, 
homes, loans, etc.) by transforming them into 
marketing investments that have common features 
and characteristics. Securitization has been used 
as a tool to obtain funding for lenders by liquefying 
assets and to reduce regulatory capital holdings. As 
a mechanism for easing the spreading and trading 
of risk, securitization seeks to homogenize diverse 
commodities and weaken the institutional buffers 
between local, national and global markets. Secu-
ritization may also be used to transform mortgage 
default risk into a range of low-risk notes (that were 
comparable with the risk rating of sovereign debt) 
whilst creating a smaller range of high-risk debt.
● Secondary mortgage market: The market where 
investment banks, financial institutions and the two 
major government-sponsored enterprises – the 
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, 
or Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mort-
gage Corporation (FHLMC, nicknamed ­Freddie 
Mac) – repackage mortgages as securities to sell 
to institutional investors in national and global 
capital markets. While the secondary mortgage 
market originated during the 1930s, it was not until 
the 1980s that Congress passed several ­statutes 
to encourage the securitization of relatively ­illiquid 
assets, such as mortgages, and attract new 
sources of investment to finance real estate. Unlike 
the primary mortgage market, where the source of 
profit is the payment of the mortgage to the bank 
that originated the loan, the source of profit in the 
secondary mortgage for securitized mortgages is 
the sale of mortgage pools that contain hundreds 
or thousands of individual mortgages. The goal of 
the secondary mortgage market is to increase the 
exchangeability and liquidity of mortgages through 
the rationalization and standardization of mortgage 
features and characteristics.
● Fannie Mae was founded in 1938 to buy and sell 
mortgages as an expedient to stimulate capital 
investment in the residential construction industry 
that had collapsed because of the Great Depres-
sion. A related purpose of Fannie Mae was to 
stimulate cash flow to enable mortgage banks, sav-
ings and loan associations, and commercial banks 
to make new loans. In 1949, Fannie Mae expanded 
its activities to include buying and selling mortgages 
guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (VA). 
The Housing Act of 1968 removed Fannie Mae 
from the federal budget and privatized the agency 
as a shareholder-owned company. In 1981, Fannie 
Mae issued its first mortgage-backed security. The 
economic downturn caused by the subprime crisis 
motivated the federal government to put Fannie 
Mae under conservatorship on 7 September 2008.
● Freddie Mac is a government sponsored enterprise 
(GSE) of the US federal government. The US 
Congress created the FHLMC in 1970 to attract 
investors to finance housing through an expanded 
secondary mortgage market. Freddie Mac buys 
mortgages on the secondary market, pools them, 
and sells them as a mortgage-backed security 
to investors to increase the money available for 
new home purchases. In response to the savings 
and loan crisis, the Financial Institutions Reform, 
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) 
revised the regulation of Freddie Mac and made 
the Federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development the supervisory agency of the GSE. 
The economic downturn caused by the subprime 
crisis motivated the federal government to put 
Freddie Mac under conservatorship on 7 Septem-
ber 2008.

Case study 18.3 
Narvik, Norway
The example of Narvik in the far north of Norway is 
widely discussed (e.g. Aalbers 2009; Pani and Holman 
2013). The city council of Narvik (population: 18,000) 
and three small, nearby municipalities had invested 
US$78 million of the revenues of a nearby hydroelectric 
plant in MBS and other products offered by investment 
banks – they lost most of it. The city’s investments were 
meant for the construction of a new school, a nursing 
home and a child-care facility. Instead, the city has cut 
the budget and as a result several small rural schools 
will be closed, budgets for elderly care have been cut, 
the city is behind payments to civil servants, and the fire 
department will cease their 24-hour/7-day-a-week ser-
vice and switch to day-time service (in a city with mostly 
wooden houses). The Norwegian state has declared it 
will not help Narvik and other municipalities, as it does 
not want to set a precedent by which the national state 
has to bear the losses of local authorities.
and mortgage markets is global in scope and also affects 
other credit markets. The crisis does not just hit invest-
ment banks on Wall Street, European banks and pension 
funds that bought MBS, but also individual investors 
and cities and towns around the globe (Case study 18.3). 
Cities and towns around the globe have been hit by the 
financial crisis. There are cities in Greece, Spain, Ireland 
and Iceland that have all been severely hit, but also cities 
in countries that seem to have weathered the financial 
crisis, whether they are located in Germany, Turkey, Bra-
zil, China or Australia. In some way, the crisis is felt in 
most economic sectors and in most places around the 
world. The only partial inclusion of, for instance, China 
in the global capitalist system has meant that produc-
tion growth was slowed down but not that the country 
entered a recession. Yet, the rapid increase in the num-
ber of vacant luxury apartments in Chinese cities sug-
gests that Chinese capitalism is also feeding local and 
national real estate bubbles – bubbles that have resulted 
in a crisis of real estate and may lead to a larger eco-
nomic crisis in China and likely elsewhere. It is crucial 
to link the spatial and temporal dimensions of local and 
global crises alike.
Cities, pensions funds, banks and individuals around 
the world had invested in MBS or the financial institu-
tions that went down in this crisis such as the US Lehman 
Brothers or the Icelandic Landsbanki. Narvik (see Case 
study 18.3) illustrates well how connected the world has 
become in the twenty-first century. It also illustrates very 
well that the world is not flat: the old geography of local 
housing markets has not been replaced by a global hous-
ing market, but by a chain that starts with the local (a 
mortgage loan on a particular property), turns national 
(through lenders), then global (in the MBS market) and 
then reverts to the local again (via the effects in places like 
Narvik). Nearly everyone in North America, Europe and 
Australia, and many in Asia, are in some way involved in 
18.2.2 The globalization of the crisis
The current financial crisis originates in local housing and 
mortgage markets, but it affects financial markets and eco-
nomic sectors around the world (Aalbers 2009; Engelen 
and Faulconbridge 2009; French et al. 2009). A few decades 
ago most mortgage lenders were local or regional institu-
tions. Today, most mortgage lenders are national lenders 
who tap into the global credit market. This is not so much 
because lenders are global financial institutions – most 
lenders are national in scope – but because they com-
pete for the same credit in a global market. In the past 
the idea was that in the wider credit market it would be 
easy for mortgage lenders to get funding, as mortgages 
were considered an ideal investment for low-risk investors. 
Cheaper credit, in return, would result in lower interest 
rates on mortgage loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, 
two government-sponsored enterprises that were meant 
to spur homeownership rates for low- and middle-income 
households, had already introduced securitization in the 
1960s. Securitization enables mortgage lenders to sell their 
mortgage portfolio on the secondary mortgage markets to 
investors (see Spotlight box 18.4).
In 2007, when foreclosure and default rates were ris-
ing and housing prices were falling, the credit crisis was 
inevitable. It was clear that investing in mortgages was 
not as low risk as people thought. The value of mortgage-
backed securities (MBS) fell even more dramatically. This 
was not only the case because many people had mortgage 
loans that were granted without down-payments, but also 
because MBS were sold on the basis that they would pro-
vide high returns. These were partly based on high inter-
est rates and not just on the value of the house, and partly 
on speculation, which increased the value of MBS beyond 
what they were actually worth. In sum, not only were 
risks underestimated, returns were also overestimated.
It now becomes easier to understand why the impact 
of partly local and partly national problems in housing 

Chapter 18  Geographies of money, finance and crisis     377
While in the past a mortgage bubble or a housing bub-
ble would affect construction firms and homeowners, the 
recent bursting of these bubbles affects the economy not 
just through homeowners (of which there are also many 
more these days), but also through financial markets. 
Because lenders are now national in scope this no longer 
affects only some housing markets, but all housing mar-
kets throughout a country. In addition, secondary mort-
gage markets are global markets, which means that a crisis 
of mortgage securitization implies that investors around 
the globe, and therefore economies around the globe, are 
affected. Housing bubbles, faltering economies and regu-
lation together have shaped the geography of the financial 
crisis at the state and city level in the USA. Subprime and 
predatory lending have affected low-income and minority 
communities more than others and we therefore not only 
see a concentration of foreclosures in certain cities but 
also in certain neighbourhoods, often those places inhab-
ited by low-income and minority groups that have been 
excluded by earlier rounds of exclusion and exploitation. 
Yet, the meanings of globalization, not unlike the causes 
and consequences of this crisis, remain geographically 
uneven. It is important to understand that cities are an 
essential element in both, and that the fates of places like 
Stockton and Narvik are not only related to each other, 
but also to those of Wall Street and Raffles Place (Singa-
pore’s financial district). The space of places is intrinsi-
cally linked to the flow of spaces.
Are the geographies of money, finance and crisis merely 
a specific case of geographies of the economy? As should 
be clear after reading this chapter, money, finance and cri-
sis are also attached to political geographies. First, finan-
cial institutions don't exist outside the political sphere but 
lobby to get what they want and what they don't want. 
They do not simply want less regulation, but sometimes 
more regulation to enable them to innovate/destruct. This 
is not only something that happened in the decades prior 
to the financial crisis, but also something that continues 
and is undermining re-regulatory efforts. Second, states, 
in particular, though not exclusively in the USA, have 
failed to protect their citizens. Financial institutions have 
been able to prey not only on homeowners and pension-
ers but also on businesses and the people who depend on 
them for their livelihoods. States are complicit in the crisis 
because they have facilitated financial innovation/destruc-
tion. Years of neoliberal restructuring, albeit in different 
forms and intensities, have yet to be replaced with more 
consumer protection and financial regulation. The funda-
mental question of what state/market relations should be, 
has hardly been addressed. There is no simple answer and 
it is of course heavily politicized (as it should be), but the 
Occupy movement and others, including insiders from the 
financial sector, have pointed to the under-regulation and 
under-policing of financial institutions.
this crisis, often as passive investors, e.g. through pensions 
funds or investments by local governments. We may not 
all be capitalists now (as a saying goes), but most of us are 
investors, whether we want – or know – it or not.
It took surprisingly long before the financial crisis 
resulted in mass demonstrations. The streets of Dublin 
remained almost empty after the government had bailed 
out the banks at the expense of its citizens. Cutbacks in 
Greece and Spain have resulted in many demonstrations, 
but it was the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement that 
resulted in something more akin to a global grassroots 
response to the financial crisis, even though OWS itself 
was inspired by revolts throughout the North and South 
Mediterranean region (Aalbers 2012b).
18.3 Conclusion: placing finance
Financial markets have become increasingly globalized 
since the 1970s, although truly ‘global’ markets are con-
centrated in a select number of major financial centres 
located in global cities (Sassen 1991). There remain dis-
tinct regional, national and supranational geographies 
of money, such that the ‘global financial system’ can be 
conceptualized as a web of intersecting networks, some 
fast, some slow, some long, some short. These financial 
networks connect different geographies of employment, 
technology, regulation, government policies, leisure 
trends and so forth. Such a conceptualization allows us to 
understand how the fates of property developers in Thai-
land affected Graham Jones in Whitley Bay. It is impor-
tant to remember then that when we talk about ‘global 
finance’, we are not talking about a machine operating 
‘out there’, but a socially, economically, culturally and 
politically constructed network of relations with which 
we engage, in some way, shape or form, on a daily basis.

 CONSUMPTION AND ITS 
GEOGRAPHIES 
 Chapter 19 

380    Section 4  Geographies of the economy
19.1 Economic geographies 
of consumption
If production refers to the economic process of making 
goods and services, then consumption refers to their 
utilization. Consumption is vital to capitalist economies. 
Without consumption, capitalist ways of organizing eco-
nomic life simply could not function. Businesses need the 
sales generated by consumption in order to realize value 
from their production processes. However, consumption 
does not just happen as a matter of course. It does not fol-
low production as night follows day. The sales that busi-
nesses require involve huge organizational efforts. Those 
efforts are of crucial importance to capitalist economies; 
they are not just ‘afterthoughts’ that try to sell what has 
been made but key components that shape the wider 
economy and its geographies. Thus, retailing is a large 
economic sector devoted to the fostering of consump-
tion and, in many cases, retail capital exercises profound 
organizational power within the systems of commodity 
production (Wrigley and Lowe 1996). More generally, 
marketing, advertising and branding are now recognized 
as strategically central to contemporary economies. This 
importance reflects their vital mediating role between the 
worlds of the producer and the consumer (Jackson and 
Taylor 1996; Nava et al. 1997; Nixon 1997; Hackley 2010). 
In parallel, discourses of consumption – that is, framing 
thought and action through a focus on ‘the consumer’ – 
have come to dominate organizational theory (du Gay 
1996), spreading out across not only private enterprise 
but on to marketized public services. The consumer has 
become a key figure, perhaps the key figure, in governing 
political economic life. Research in economic geography 
has responded to these trends, recognizing consumption 
as an important interest, alongside concerns with the 
geographies of production and finance.
However, even as consumption is economically vital, 
it is not purely economic. Indeed, this is one of the main 
reasons why so much effort and expense is devoted to 
commercial practices of retailing, advertising, market-
ing and branding. Consumption is not a simple matter 
and goes well beyond the limited transactional moment 
of purchase. Any sale has a ‘back story’, the predisposi-
tions that shape our buying of this or that. Any sale also 
has an ‘afterlife’, as we use what we have purchased. If 
we reflect back on our opening definition of consump-
tion – the utilization of the products of human labour – 
then we see how purchase is but the start of an on-going 
story concerned with the active use of the things we buy. 
If we think of consumption as being about how we use 
products then we begin to sense that whilst consump-
tion is central to economics it is not reducible to it. How 
we use things is implicated in an array of other issues: 
the way we conduct our daily lives, our management of 
household and family affairs, our senses of self-identity, 
our moral senses of how our lives ought to be and of 
how we ought to relate to others. This is one reason why 
consumption has been something of an enigma to main-
stream economics (Douglas and Isherwood 1996).
Our suggestion, then, is that consumption is a vital 
economic process, but not limited to a narrowly defined 
economic realm. In particular, it extends into our wider 
culture. Consumption is cultural as well as economic; it is 
‘cultural-economic’ (Amin and Thrift 2004). One has to 
approach consumption not through a narrow economic 
geography but through a wider ‘cultural-economic geog-
raphy’ if one is to understand its causes, characters and 
consequences. The cultural character to consumption has 
been pursued in various ways that, in turn, relate to var-
ied emphases on what is meant by culture. For some, this 
means emphasizing the adoption of goods within exist-
ing status structures and patterns of class distinction, so 
that consumption is regulated by, and reproduces, socially 
structured and inherited cultural tastes (Bourdieu 1984). 
What we consume both reflects and creates what sort of 
class position and cultural identity we have. Others high-
light the role of commodities within the private dream 
worlds of consumers, so that consumption is more about 
fulfilling our culturally inflected fantasies and desires 
than conforming to socially structured tastes (Camp-
bell 1987). And still others, focusing on more mundane 
forms of consumption, like household provisioning and 
food shopping, attend to how the things we buy enact 
domestic relations of love and care. From this perspective, 
consumer culture is about concretizing our relationships 
to our nearest and dearest and forming domestic ‘moral 
economies’ (Miller 1998).

geographies’.

on or up. Both that embodied sense of comfort, and 
his response, are far from innate. Nor are they subject 
solely to crude economic forces of price. As Elizabeth 
Shove has demonstrated, our senses of things like com-
fort are not fixed, but change historically and between 
cultures (Shove 2003; Shove and Walker 2014). Philip, 
for example, grew up in a house without central heat-
ing; back then, if he was cold during the day he either 
moved to a room that had a heat source in it (an open 
fire or the cooking range) or put on more clothes. Now, 
like most households in the UK, he has got used to a 
normal domestic environment close to 20°C and the 
energy consumption that goes along with that. Now 
when he feels cold he turns on the heating. His habits and 
embodied senses of comfort have changed in conjunction 
with transformations in domestic infrastructure such as 
central heating. This may seem pretty inconsequential, 
after all Philip only flicked a switch. But, as Shove says, 
it ‘acquires more sinister overtones when we recall the 
Another way of framing the cultural character to 
consumption is to emphasize that often what we are 
consuming is not only material goods but images, mean-
ings, feelings and experiences. A close to hand example 
may help to illustrate the point. Think a little about the 
clothes you are currently wearing. Clothes are material 
goods. In capitalist societies most of our clothes are 
products of industrialized systems of production and 
consumption. Notwithstanding the supposed renaissance 
of crafts like knitting, we rarely make our own clothes. 
Now, for sure, clothing fulfils some basic material needs 
such as warmth, but it does much more than that (Miller 
2010). Clothing can be a language, through which we say 
something about who we are. It is likely, for example, 
that your clothes speak to aspects of your identity such as 
your gender or your age. They may do this through their 
material form – what type of clothing they are (blouse or 
shirt?; skirt or trousers?), what cut and shape they are, 
what fabric or colour – and through their associations 
with particular retailers and designers – what brand they 
are, whether they are new or second-hand or ‘vintage’, 
and so on. And clothes do not just convey an image; they 
help to make us who we are through their role in our 
embodiment. Clothes do indeed maketh the man and 
woman. What we wear shapes how we carry ourselves, 
maybe even how we feel. An old pair of sweatpants for 
‘slobbing out’ at home; high heels to feel glamorous; a 
suit, to be professional; there are lots of examples that 
illustrate how what we wear shapes how we comport 
and feel about ourselves. What about you? What are you 
wearing right now? What do your clothes say about you? 
How do they make you feel?
Not all the consumption we undertake is as self-con-
scious as when we choose what clothes to buy and wear. 
Another way of thinking about consumption as cultural 
(as well as economic) is to emphasize its relationship to 
somewhat taken for granted habits and technologies. This 
has become known as a ‘theories of practice’ approach 
to consumption (Warde 2014). Here, the emphasis is not 
so much on how we can express our social and cultural 
identities through consumption, but rather more on how 
routine practices of consumption come to be and come 
to be taken for granted.
Another ‘close to hand’ example can illustrate the 
approach. While writing and editing this part of the 
chapter in his study at home this morning, one of us, 
Philip, got cold, and in response turned on the central 
heating. He is now buying additional gas. He is also, to a 
small measure, further depleting the quantity of a non-
renewable energy resource. He is doing so because his 
own sense of comfortable domestic ambient tempera-
ture was disturbed, and because he has become used to 
responding to a feeling of cold by turning the heating

382    Section 4  Geographies of the economy
Indeed, here consumer culture is cast as a way of life that 
is brought into being in order to ensure that mass produc-
tion is accompanied by the appropriate levels of mass 
consumption. All in all, in such accounts consumers are 
portrayed as rather sad and pacified figures whose cul-
tural lives are subordinated to the economic priorities of 
producers (see Spotlight box 19.1).
On the other hand, it is possible to see consumer cul-
ture as less passive, as less controlled, as less subordi-
nate. Here the emphasis is not on consumers being made 
to consume, but on consumers using the things they buy 
for their own ends. In this perspective, consumption is 
less the death of the commodity, the end point of an 
economic chain that began with the commodity’s pro-
duction, and more the commodity’s resurrection. Here, 
consumption is seen as involving the ‘culturalization 
of the economy’. In this spirit a range of research has 
stressed how consumers can creatively rework the prod-
ucts being sold to them, giving them new meanings in 
the process, and using them as launch pads for their own 
symbolic and practical creativity (Willis 1990). A classic 
example is the Italian motor scooter and its histories of 
consumption in the UK (Hebdige 1987). Having been 
originally aimed in the post-war years at a market of 
young, urban women in Italy, in the United Kingdom the 
Lambretta and Vespa scooters became a central identi-
fier of the ‘Mod’ subculture. Initially attractive to Mods 
for its Italianicity and design aesthetics, by the late 
1960s the scooter was increasingly symbolically recast 
and materially customized to act as a subcultural icon 
opposed to the British, brute masculinity of ‘Rockers’ 
global environmental costs of maintaining what we now 
think of as comfortable conditions indoors’ (Shove 2003: 
28). It is quite likely that as you read this chapter you may 
also be in a centrally heated or air-conditioned building 
and thus part of a conventionalized consumption prac-
tice of ambient temperature and artificial climate con-
trol. You too may need to feel comfortable to work well. 
You too may be undertaking a mundane, habitual act of 
energy consumption that has wider implications. You too 
may be embodying how consumption is shaped by taken 
for granted cultural norms and practices that co-evolve 
with socio-technical systems like domestic heating and 
energy supplies.
Our argument, then, is that consumption is: (a) an 
important topic for economic geography; and (b) one 
that tends to require approaches that are, in various 
ways, ‘cultural-economic’ in character. In turn, this begs 
the question of the kind of relationships between cul-
ture and economy generated through consumption. For 
some, the predominant trend is for economic, commer-
cial imperatives to dominate and degrade our cultural 
lives: a so-called ‘economization of culture’. Famously, 
the philosopher Herbert Marcuse argued that in capital-
ist societies ‘false needs’ are produced (Marcuse 1964), 
with consumption promoted by a wanting and requir-
ing of far more than is materially necessary (Plate 19.2). 
More specifically, numerous studies have debated the 
role of advertising in stimulating consumption, creating 
desires for products that would otherwise not exist (for 
a classic study in this vein, see Packard 1977). According 
to this portrait, then, it is economic forces that dominate. 
Spotlight box 19.1
Don Slater on consumerism as the end 
of culture
Consumers are often cast as ‘irrational slave[s]  
to trivial, materialistic desires who can be 
­manipulated into childish mass conformity by 
­calculating mass producers. This consumer is 
a cultural dupe or dope, the mug seduced by 
advertising, the fashion victim . . . yuppies who would 
sell their birthright for a mass of designer labels. 
Ostensibly exercising free choice, this consumer 
actually offends against all the aspirations of modern 
Western citizens to be free, rational, autonomous 
and self-defining.
(Slater 1997: 33)
‘Consumer culture’, in this perspective, is merely an 
ersatz, artificial, mass-manufactured and pretty poor 
substitute for the world we have lost in post-traditional 
society. In fact, it is the antithesis and enemy of culture. 
In it individual choice and desire triumph over abiding 
social values and obligations; the whims of the present 
take precedence over the truth embodied in history, tradi-
tion and continuity; needs, values and goods are manu-
factured and calculated in relation to profit rather than 
arising organically from authentic individual or communal 
life. Above all, consumerism represents the triumph of 
economic value over all other kinds and sources of social 
worth. Everything can be bought and sold. Everything 
has its price. ‘Consumer culture’, therefore, is a contra-
diction in terms for much of modern Western Thought.
(Slater 1997: 63)

reflecting on the process of branding, the circulation of 
brands, and the implications of both for cultural and 
geographical difference. Second, in examples ranging 
from shopping centres to nightclubs, we foreground 
the local contexts of consumption, reflecting on how 
they can both represent the strategies of commercial 
interests, designed to promote and regulate consump-
tion, and stage the remaking of places into forms that 
accord to different cultural logics than those of com-
merce and economic rationality. Third, we turn to the 
connections between consumers and producers forged 
through consumption. The everyday acts of consump-
tion we undertake in particular places are dependent 
upon wider networks of provision. The last part of the 
chapter therefore reflects on these networks and what 
we consumers know about them. In so doing, it offers 
a critical consideration of ideas of a (geo)ethical con-
sumption and the kinds of worldly knowledge fostered 
through our lives as consumers.
19.2 Branding and marketing  
geography
Today’s consumer landscapes are populated with brands 
(Arvidsson 2006). From renowned exponents of brand 
development (like Apple or Nike), to globally recognized 
brands (like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s) and more 
locally specific brand names (like Marks & Spencer, Aldi 
or Lidl in Western Europe), brands mark out both what 
and where we consume. Pike defines a brand as an ‘iden-
tifiable kind or variety of good or service . . . constituted 
of values or “equity” . . . such as associations, awareness, 
loyalty, origin and perceived quality’ (2009a: 619). In many 
and their motorbikes (Plate 19.3). The scooter became 
part of a culture that its original designers had no 
knowledge of and certainly did not control. Designed 
as a form of transport for urban women in post-war 
Italy, the Italian motor scooter actually enabled a novel 
form of working class culture and youthful masculinity 
to be created in the UK.
More recently, commentators have placed renewed 
emphasis on these forms of consumer creativity. In par-
ticular, some have argued that consumers are increas-
ingly becoming ‘prosumers’, not just using products 
supplied to them but making them anew or completing 
them (Ritzer and Jurgenson 2010). Digital culture is often 
cast as central here, leading to product forms where con-
sumers are also producers. Think of a smartphone. It is 
made and supplied with a range of capacities but it is the 
consumer who completes and develops these: download-
ing apps, creating a music library, and so on. In turn, 
how consumers use their smartphones becomes central to 
digital economies. Taking photos, making videos, down-
loading and using apps like Instagram and Twitter, build-
ing up contacts, friends and followers . . . putting these 
together through the smartphone helps to make a new 
media economy in which consumer practices (what we 
do), cultural identities (how we present ourselves) and 
social networks (who we share this with) become mon-
etized (see Pfaff 2010).
In weighing up these relations between economy and 
culture in consumption this chapter focuses on three 
geographies. First, we focus on ‘brands’ as a crucial 
component of contemporary economic geographies,

are remade through their consumption.

2004) – as bywords for a consumerist homogenization and 
cultural imperialism (Plate 19.5). In a fascinating analysis, 
the sociologist George Ritzer (2004) sees brands as part of 
a new global culture of ‘nothingness’. As he puts it: ‘The 
social world, particularly in the realm of consumption, is 
increasingly characterized by nothing. In this case, “noth-
ing” refers to a social form that is generally centrally con-
ceived, controlled and comparatively devoid of distinctive 
substantive content . . . we are witnessing the globalization 
of nothing’ (Ritzer 2004: 3, 2). In turn, brands are associ-
ated with designed commercial spaces, ‘brandscapes’ and 
‘non-places’, characterized by a lack of substantive differ-
ence, which makes them amenable to global distribution. 
For Ritzer, consumption tends to produce empty forms 
and spaces, devoid of ties to particular times and places. 
McDonald’s the brand is delivered through McDonald’s 
outlets that look and feel the same around the world.
Others are less sure that the result of global brands is 
global homogenization. Indeed Ritzer himself accepts that 
sometimes branded nothingness is reworked into ‘some-
thing’ through how it is received in particular times and 
places. Consumer culture does not float above the world 
in some abstract space of capital or modernity. Global 
products land and take root in particular places and times. 
In so doing, such forms of global consumer culture not 
only impact on their surroundings; they are also shaped 
by them. Anthropological studies in particular have devel-
oped this theme, exploring how globally distributed facets 
of consumer culture – whether particular goods, styles or 
cultural orientations – are locally incorporated. Take, for 
example, one of the exemplars of homogenizing Ameri-
can consumer culture: McDonald’s restaurants. They are 
famed for their uniformity; the same decor, the same basic 
menu (with very small variations, such as McSpaghetti in 
the Philippines or the Maharajah Mac in India), and the 
same service style the world over. And yet, McDonald’s 
may not be just a force for cultural homogenization. This 
areas of the economy, analysts see a shift in emphasis away 
from material manufacture and towards the fashioning of 
branded ‘signs and spaces’ (Lash and Urry 1994) that are 
oriented to commercially profitable consumption.
According to Robert Goldman and Stephen Papson 
(1998), Nike are exemplary here, illustrating a wider shift 
towards a ‘sign-economy’ in which brands are central to 
both production and consumption. For them, Nike do not 
so much make and sell sportswear as make and sell the 
Nike brand, constituted through the sign and typography 
of the Nike name, the logo of the ‘swoosh’, advertised 
‘philosophies’ such as ‘Just do it’, and retail spaces like 
‘Niketown’. Nike adverts work to present the brand and 
its values. Rather than focusing on specific products and 
their material qualities, Nike adverts have tended to focus 
on portraying Nike in relation to wider ideals of empower-
ment and self-realization (‘Just do it’). The now ubiquitous 
strategy of celebrity brand ambassadors and representa-
tives was pioneered by Nike, as a means to associate the 
brand with sporting achievement in general, specific 
impressive figures (from Michael Jordan to Serena Wil-
liams) and wider sporting and style cultures (in particular, 
American black cultures). For Nike, Goldman and Pap-
son suggest, the brand is now supreme; the material good 
and its production are simply a means to that end. Nike 
sportswear and its other physical products are the vehicles 
to mobilize the brand. So, Nike sub-contract manufacture; 
they do not make Nike stuff themselves. Sure, Nike execu-
tives are concerned about the physicality of Nike products, 
but this is less in terms of them as manufactured goods 
than in terms of them as outcomes of a ‘design’ process 
that materializes brand and sign value within the product. 
Goldman and Papson document how Nike invest far more 
in advertising and promotion (around 10 per cent of annual 
revenues) than in physical infrastructure (around 3 to 5 
per cent; and this includes facilities such as the ‘Niketown’ 
retail outlets) (Goldman and Papson 1998: 13). Nike’s busi-
ness and its corporate geographies are constructed to be 
market-led and market-leading. In emphasizing the brand 
and its brand values, Nike is consumption focused.
19.2.1 Branded geographies of nothingness?
Economic geographers have now begun to pay attention 
to brands (see in particular Pike 2009a, 2009b, 2011). One 
key area of interest is the relationship between brands and 
cultural and geographical differences. For some, brands 
are powerful forces of homogenization in the world. It is 
hard to miss the worldwide spread of products and brands 
such as McDonald’s, Coca-Cola or Starbucks. Indeed, 
such brands have entered academic language – in the form 
of theses on the ‘McDonaldization of society’ (Ritzer 
2000) or of ‘Coca-colonization’ (for a critique see Flusty

His conclusion is that there is indeed a two-way 
interaction:
McDonald’s has effected small but influential changes 
in East Asian dietary patterns. Until the introduction 
of McDonald’s, for example, Japanese consumers 
rarely, if ever, ate with their hands . . . this is now an 
acceptable mode of dining . . . [However,] East Asian 
consumers have quietly, and in some cases stubbornly, 
transformed their neighborhood McDonald’s into 
local institutions. [For example,] In the United States 
fast food may indeed imply fast consumption, but this 
is certainly not the case . . . [in] Beijing, Seoul, and 
Taipei . . . [where] McDonald’s restaurants are treated 
as leisure centers, where people can retreat from the 
stresses of urban life.
(Watson 1997a: 6–7)
was certainly Watson’s (1997a) conclusion, based on stud-
ies of the consumption of McDonald’s in East Asia (see 
Case study 19.1). These studies found that McDonald’s 
has been localized, indigenized and incorporated into tra-
ditional cultural forms and practices, even as it has played 
a part in the ongoing dynamism of those traditions. As 
Watson poses the question:
Does the spread of fast food undermine the integrity 
of indigenous cuisines? Are food chains helping to cre-
ate a homogeneous, global culture better suited to the 
needs of a capitalist world order? . . . But isn't another 
scenario possible? Have people in East Asia conspired 
to change McDonald’s, modifying this seemingly 
monolithic institution to fit local conditions? . . . [Per-
haps] the interaction process works both ways.
(Watson 1997a: 5–6)
Case study 19.1 
Consuming McDonald’s in East Asia
McDonald’s outlets have colonized much of East 
Asia, from their arrival in Hong Kong in the 1970s to 
their growth in metropolitan mainland China since the 
1990s. However, just how McDonald’s is consumed 
varies across the region. In Beijing, for example, 
McDonald’s lost its American role as a place of fast 
and cheap food. Instead, Yan suggests, it became a 
middle-class consumption place, somewhere for a 
special family outing where ‘customers linger . . . for 
hours, relaxing, chatting, reading, enjoying the music’ 
(1997: 72). McDonald’s here is seen as American, 
but Americana means something stylish, exotic and 
foreign, resulting in the meanings and experiences of 
McDonald’s in Beijing being very un-American. In con-
trast, in Japan, whilst there is a similar leisurely use of 
McDonald’s, it is not a place of exotic social prestige, 
but a youth hangout, a place where someone in a busi-
ness suit would be out of place (Ohnuki-Tierney 1997). 
In Hong Kong (Watson 1997b), where McDonald’s was 
introduced in the 1970s, its restaurants were initially 
patronized by adolescents seeking to escape products 
associated both with China and with Hong Kong’s per-
ceived provincialism. However, by the 1990s McDon-
ald’s had become routinely local, just another mundane 
part of the Hong Kong landscape: ‘[t]oday, McDonald’s 
restaurants in Hong Kong are packed – wall to wall – 
with people of all ages, few of whom are seeking an 
American cultural experience. The chain has become a 
local institution in the sense that it has blended into the 
urban landscape . . . McDonald’s is not perceived as 
an exotic or alien institution’ (Watson 1997b: 87, 107).

Hence the meanings and practices of consuming 
McDonald’s – often cast as an icon of global homog-
enization – vary from place to place. Melissa Caldwell’s 
work (2004) on McDonald’s and consumer culture in 
post-Soviet Moscow reinforces the argument. In Russia 
too McDonald’s has been indigenized or ‘domesticated’, 
and not just at the level of everyday practice. Counter-
intuitively, McDonald’s – which as outsiders we might 
read as an American export to Russia – has come to be 
understood by consumers in Moscow as an ‘authenti-
cally Russian product’, to the extent that eating there is 
seen as responding to ‘nationalist-oriented consumer 
campaigns’ (Caldwell 2004: 5). Whilst initially perceived 
and promoted as an exotic American import, more 
recently McDonald’s has become Russian, explicitly mar-
keted as ‘Nash Makdonalds’ (which Caldwell translates 
as ‘our McDonald’s’). Since the mid-1990s, Russian con-
sumer culture more generally has evidenced a patriotic 
enthusiasm for goods understood as ‘Nash’. This Nash 
ideology entangles notions of national space with those 
of everyday familiarity and trust. McDonald’s in Moscow 
has embraced this ideology and has thus been trans-
formed from American exotica to both mundane familiar-
ity and imagined Russianness.
19.2.2 Brands and their geographical entanglements
Not only does the consumption of branded products dif-
fer from place to place, but also ideas of cultural and 
geographical difference – what we might call ‘imagina-
tive geographies’ (Driver 2014) – are produced and sold 
within brands themselves. Pike sees this as part of the 
‘geographical entanglement’ of brands, how brand val-
ues and equity ‘are imbued to varying degrees and in 
differing ways by spatial connections and connotations’ 
(2009a: 619). Taking the example of Newcastle Brown 
Ale (a beer brand) (Plate 19.7), Pike (2011) shows how 
the meanings of the brand are bound up with imagina-
tions of its geographical origin (sometimes framed as 
Newcastle, sometimes framed as the North, sometimes 
framed as England). An iconic Newcastle landscape, with 
the bridge over the Tyne, still adorns Newcastle Brown 
Ale’s logo and packaging. These imaginations are also 
related to the product’s spatial movements around the 
world; for example, in the American market, where sales 
now outnumber those for the UK, Newcastle Brown Ale’s 
particular local origins are less important than a looser 
sense of it as an English and an ‘urban’ product. Others 
too have noted how geographical images are a resource to 
be used in projects of brand making and differentiation. 
Marianne Lien, for example, narrates a fascinating case 
study of frozen pizza marketing in Norway, as one com-
pany (given the pseudonym Viking Foods) differentiates 
its product lines through geographical associations (Lien 
2000). Some of these are predictable and none too sub-
tle: one pizza line is ‘made Italian’ and more ‘authentic’ 
through packaging that references Il Tricolore’s green, 
white and red, and uses Italian place names and lan-
guage; another line is ‘made American’, more ‘modern’ 
and more oriented to a youthful market with a packag-
ing that incorporates images of the stars and stripes, 
American football helmets, cowboys and the Statue of 
Liberty! But other positionings are more complicated, in 
particular in the case of a pizza product line that Viking 
Foods wanted to establish as meaningfully Norwegian to 
their Norwegian consumers. This meant branding and 
producing what they term a ‘folkepizzaen’ (which one 
might translate as ‘the Norwegian people’s pizza’).
More generally, you are probably familiar with a range 
of examples of such branded place association. Think, 
for example, about the bottled waters that appeal to place 
imagery to differentiate a somewhat generic commodity: 
Highlands water from Scotland, French mineral water from 
Evian, Fiji Water (‘straight from the isolated and idyllic Fiji 
Islands without ever being touched by man’), and so on (on 
water branding see Wilk 2006; for the case of marketing

Chapter 19  Consumption and its geographies    387
There are a number of implications of these associa-
tions between consumption and imaginations of cultural 
and geographic difference. For a start, it means we need 
to broaden the critique of consumer culture beyond a 
debate over its tendencies for homogenization (making 
everything and everywhere the same) to consider capi-
talist processes of ‘heterogenization’ (making things 
and places ‘different’ as a marketing process). In Naomi 
Klein’s terms, we need to recognize the emergence of 
a ‘market masala’, where differences become part of 
capitalist consumer culture (Klein 2000). For some com-
mentators, such as Klein herself, it is the politics of incor-
poration that are key here. Capitalism, via consumer 
culture, increasingly absorbs forms of difference, whether 
cultural, geographical or political, that might seem in 
opposition to it. Oppositional voices need to find ways 
either to resist or to use this incorporation for their own 
ends (see also McGuigan 2009; Mukherjee and Banet-
Wieser 2012).
For others, capitalist heterogenization is not so much 
a top-down process of incorporation as it is a diverse 
range of ways in which difference becomes commodi-
fied and consumption acts as a space for cross-cultural 
encounters and translations (Jackson 1999). In this per-
spective a range of other issues come to the fore. How, 
for example, are consumer cultures implicated in present 
and past circulations of different material cultures, and 
with what effects on national cultures? What kinds of dif-
ferences are fostered or discouraged within consumption 
and what are the implications of this for the wider poli-
tics of identity? What options are there for both produc-
ers and consumers to express and develop their cultural 
identities through commercial cultures? Such questions 
have shaped a set of research projects by Philip Crang 
and colleagues on the presence of South Asian ‘stuff’ 
in British consumption cultures, especially of food and 
fashion. Drawing on wider conceptual reflections on the 
relations between commodity cultures and transnational-
ity (Crang et al. 2003) these studies have looked at topics 
such as: how ‘Asian’ and ‘Eastern’ difference is presented 
and commodified in contemporary British food market-
ing (Jackson 2002) and fashion design and retail (Dwyer 
and Crang 2002; Dwyer and Jackson 2003; Jackson et 
al. 2007); and how these contemporary fashions for 
South Asian styled goods relate to past colonial histo-
ries in which South Asian materials (such as cotton, or 
the boteh/Paisley pattern) were central to British cultures 
of design, fashion and dress (Crang and Ashmore 2009; 
Breward et al. 2010).
More generally, we have long argued that consumer 
cultures can act as arenas of geographical knowledge, 
in which understandings of both the origins of what we 
consume and our own places in the world are played out 
Fijian water see Connell 2006 and Kaplan 2007). Or con-
sider products that associate themselves in some way with 
imagined geographical areas such as the tropics or the rain-
forest, often to claim some ‘natural’ qualities (for a critical 
analysis of a ‘rainforest’ perfume see Slater 2004; on ‘tropi-
cal fruit’ see Cook et al. 2004). Or there are the brands 
that draw upon national identities in framing their brand 
equities: for example, the likes of Paul Smith and Burberry 
presenting their Britishness within the fashion economy 
(Goodrum 2005); or car brands like Alfa Romeo (claiming 
Italian passion) or MINI (with its fascinating marriage of 
British quirkiness and Germanic efficiency).
This interest in the ‘geographical entanglements’ and 
‘placing’ of brands (Pike 2009a) builds on longer stand-
ing arguments. Central here is research on ‘brandscapes’ 
and themed environments, that focuses on how imagina-
tive geographies shape the making of consumption spaces 
(Klingmann 2007). In Disneyland and Disney World, for 
example, the amusements and other consumption oppor-
tunities are not just randomly arrayed, but organized into 
distinct imaginative geographies: Frontierland, themed 
on the American West; Adventureland, themed on land-
scapes of European colonialism and imperialism; and so 
on (see Gottdiener 1982; Wilson 1992; Bryman 1995). This 
is a pattern to be found in many large shopping centres, 
most famously the huge West Edmonton Mall in Canada 
(Crawford 1992; see also Goss 1999a) but also in more 
recent developments such as the Mercato Mall in Dubai. 
The promotional text on the Mercato Mall website gives a 
good sense of the geographically and historically themed 
experience on offer: ‘Mercato is ideally located in the heart 
of Jumeirah, one of Dubai’s most prestigious residential 
areas. Much more than just a shopping mall, Mercato 
epitomizes the very best in Italian architecture and trans-
ports you back to the Renaissance period. Home to pic-
turesque cobbled streets, charming piazzas and authentic 
Tuscan and Venetian features, Mercato on Jumeirah Beach 
Road offers a unique and incomparable ambience, not 
to mention a thoroughly enjoyable ­shopping and leisure 
experience’ (http://mercatoshoppingmall.com). Whole 
urban areas can extend this sort of themed consump-
tion landscape; the Las Vegas strip being perhaps the best 
known. Indeed, Gottdiener (1997) goes so far as to posit 
that consumer culture has produced a general ‘theming of 
America’, so that theme parks become models for what is 
happening across the urban landscapes outside them. Sack 
(1992: 98) agrees that consumer culture is marked by a pro-
duction of ‘pseudo-places’. As part of a wider time–space 
compression, Harvey (1989) sees a general trend towards 
highly packaged, and indeed simulated, experiences of cul-
tural and geographical difference, such that microcosms of 
the whole world are encountered in particular consump-
tion spaces.

event, that says they were thinking about you (Miller 
1998); the birthday present; and so on.
This entangling of economic and social relations 
through consumption is not limited to domestic space. It 
is also true of public spaces of consumption. Here com-
modity culture is implicated in our forms of public social-
ity and in how we relate to our immediate environments, 
our local places. By way of illustration, we start with the 
places where people go shopping.
19.3.1 Shopping and place
Shopping centres (or malls as they are more commonly 
termed in North America) are routinely cast as the cathe-
drals of our consumerist age, symbols of our worship 
of commodity culture. But what goes on inside a shop-
ping centre, and what does this tell us about the kinds 
of places being produced in the world of consumption?
One response would be that in shopping centres we 
are manipulated into behaving in certain ways, and espe-
cially into buying things, by the power of the shopping 
centre as a place. It is certainly the case that shopping 
centres are in part designed according to a ‘merchandise 
plan’ (Maitland 1985: 8) that tries to maximize the expo-
sure of consumers to goods. In older shopping centres 
and malls this plan tended to be understood in quite 
mechanical terms. Shopping centres were seen as func-
tional ‘machines for shopping’. ‘Generator’ stores are 
used to pull us to the shopping centre in the first place, 
and once we are there ‘magnet’ stores every 200 metres or 
so make sure we do not just pop in and out, but explore 
every part of it. Here, then, ‘the public mall [is defined] 
as essentially the passive outcome of a merchandising 
plan, a channel for the manipulation of pedestrian flows’ 
(Cook and Crang 1996). Think, for instance, of how food 
marketing presents geographically referenced cuisines 
(Indian food, Chinese food, Italian food, Mexican food, 
and so on). Here, a mundane realm of consumption is 
also a setting in which ideas of cultural difference and 
mixture are played out, as retailers and restaurants pre-
sent consumers with ‘the world on a plate’ (for a sample 
of work on food geographies see Cook et al. 1999, 2000a, 
2008; Duruz 2005; Monrreal 2008).
19.3 Local geographies of consumption
Earlier we suggested that consumption involves the exten-
sion of the economy into realms of life that we might 
not usually think of as economic, into our wider ‘cul-
ture’. This is also true at the more immediate scale of 
our own everyday economies. When we buy goods we 
take them home; we ‘domesticate’ them. In consuming 
things, we make them part of household relations; we 
live with them and their lives become shaped by ours 
(Gregson 2007). They become part of what we might call 
‘moral economies’, insofar as: ‘[t]he household is a moral 
economy because the economic activities of its members 
are defined and informed by a wider set of cognitions, 
evaluations and aesthetics, which themselves are defined 
and informed by the biographies of the household and its 
members’ (Silverstone et al. 1992: 11). The language here 
may be unfamiliar, but we all have experiences of how 
economic goods become part of something else, some-
thing more than economic, in their consumption: the toys 
that become childhood companions and then symbols of 
our childhood and its end (a narrative powerfully mined 
by the makers of Pixar’s Toy Story movie trilogy); the lit-
tle ‘treat’, bought by a loved one in a mundane shopping

Chapter 19  Consumption and its geographies    389
Take the case of Bert, 78 years old, and a regular visitor 
to a shopping mall in New England (USA):
I come here at quarter to eleven and I leave at twenty 
minutes past one . . . I do this five days a week, except 
I missed one day this year . . . And I have my lunch 
here at noontime . . . I move every half-hour. I go from 
here down to where the clock is, I go down in front of 
Woolworth’s, then I come back again and go up there 
and take my bus by the front of JC Penney.
(Quoted in Lewis 1990: 126)
For Bert, the mall is not a place to shop, but some-
where sheltered to go outside his house, a chance to meet 
up with friends. For the mall management there is the 
option of evicting these low-spending visitors, but eject-
ing old people forcibly on to the pavement is hardly good 
public relations. Instead, and as part of wider moves to 
see malls as the new civic centres, Bert’s mall has actually 
established its own walking club for the elderly, with over 
300 members, for whom the doors open at 6 a.m., rather 
than 9 a.m. when shops open.
Adolescents also use the mall as a meeting place, 
somewhere to hang out. They also spend very little. 
‘Suburban kids come to malls to look around, meet and 
make friends, and hang out – because there is nowhere 
else to go’ (Lewis 1990: 130). Or as Ed and Tammy, self-
confessed ‘mall rat’ and ‘mall bunny’ respectively, put it:
[Gesturing around himself] I met all these people here. 
I’ve met lots of other people, too. One place where you 
can always find someone . . . 
(Ed; quoted in Lewis 1990: 130)
I used to come here every Saturday from 11 am to 9.30 
pm and just walk around with my friends, like Gina 
here, and just walk around and check out the guys.
(Tammy; quoted in Lewis 1990: 130)
Unlike the elderly, the mall is less indulgent of these 
teenagers. There are constant skirmishes with the secu-
rity staff over how long ten people can share one Coke 
at the food court, and some mall rats and bunnies get 
banned altogether.
So what are we to make of our trip to the mall? What 
does it tell us about the local geographies of consump-
tion? Well, it certainly tells us that place matters to con-
sumption. But how? Here the answer is more ambivalent. 
In part what we see is a pseudo-public space symbolizing 
and enacting claims for consumption to be all there is 
to civic life, making citizens consumers in a very con-
crete way. In this light, shopping centres illustrate how 
place can produce both acts of consumption and people 
as consumers. Yet in shopping centres one also sees the 
(Maitland 1985: 10). There are well-known tricks to 
make us behave as the shopping centre management and 
its shops want: escalators arranged so we have to walk 
past shop fronts or merchandise when going between 
floors; hard seats so we do not linger too long without 
getting up and seeing some more potential purchases; no 
water fountains so we have to buy expensive drinks (see 
Goss 1993).
In more recent shopping centres, however, the manip-
ulation may be more subtle. Increasingly, retail planners 
and developers see their job as providing spectacular 
places that people will want to spend time in. This is 
partly because research suggests that the longer people 
stay the more on average they spend; but it also stems 
from intensified competition between shopping centres, 
such that each one needs more than just the usual shops 
to attract us in the first place – everything from fountains 
to funfairs (see, for example, Goss 1999b on The Mall 
of America). Here, then, the manipulation of shoppers 
is less mechanical and more ‘affective’. The hope is to 
excite, inspire, relax and please. Jacob Miller’s (2014) 
study of the Abasto mall in Buenos Aires, Argentina 
is an excellent up-to-date exploration of this issue. Of 
course, as Miller notes, these are promotional intentions 
rather than shoppers’ experiences. As Chaney (1990) 
puts it in his review of the MetroCentre in Gateshead, 
north-east England, the designer’s utopian impulses 
to produce a place of perfection often result in rather 
underwhelming, ‘subtopian’ forms. Nonetheless, there 
is much here to be taken seriously. There is the attempt 
to produce a fabricated space in which the individual 
consumer can be made to feel like consuming (see Goss 
1999a). There is the emphasis on creating an internal, 
closed-off, privately owned but partially public envi-
ronment, divorced from the harsh exterior world, not 
only climatically but also socially, through the operation 
of security systems that ensure the absence of anyone 
who might threaten this consumer paradise or disrupt 
the pleasure of the shopper. There is the emphasis on 
managing how malls make us feel, their affective quali-
ties and atmospheres, as part of the commercial work of 
retail capital (Miller 2014).
Such shopping centres recognize that there is much 
more to going shopping than buying things (Glennie and 
Thrift 1992). Shopping is in part about experiencing an 
urban space, seeing and being seen by other shoppers. It 
is a social activity. Malls seek to manage this social expe-
rience. The street gets recast as a purified space of lei-
surely consumption, cleansed of ‘nuisances’ that inhabit 
the ‘real’ streets, like ‘street people’. However, this fash-
ioning of the mall can be disturbed. Retail spaces can be 
reclaimed by those who use them. Leading the charge are 
a mixed assortment of senior citizens and adolescents. 

390    Section 4  Geographies of the economy
practices, of memorable performances. For Borden, this 
contests the commodified logic that underpins contem-
porary urban space.
However, these sorts of performative engagements 
with place can also be reclaimed as commodities. The 
business theorists Joseph Pine and James Gilmore talk 
more generally about the emergence of an ‘experience 
economy’ focused on the production and consumption 
of memorable experiences (Pine and Gilmore 1999; see 
also Sundbo and Sorensen 2013). Place is again central 
here; this is a theatrical economy, in which places are the 
arenas in which certain kinds of social performances can 
be developed. Consumption is the undertaking of those 
performances. Clubs (in the sense of nightclubs) are 
exemplary.
In London alone there are over 500 club nights on offer 
every week. In Britain the industry has a turnover of £1.8 
billion per annum, and it is estimated that 42 per cent of 
the population now visit a club once a year, 42 per cent 
of 15–19-year-olds at least once a month (Mintel 2004, 
2006). Although the industry has suffered some decline in 
the UK (Robinson 2013), urban and regional economies 
have developed based on thriving club scenes: in Berlin, as 
clubbers jet in on low-cost carriers from across Europe; in 
Ibiza, as a youthful tourist market is targeted; in Goa, as 
international ‘trance freak’ tourists join Indian youth in 
sometimes uneasy dancing crowds (Saldanha 2002). But 
what are such economies actually selling? Ben Malbon 
(1997, 1999) argues that clubs are spaces of play. This 
should really not need saying. It is patently obvious that 
people go to clubs to have fun. It is also patently obvi-
ous that this fun is achieved through a variety of means. 
Through enjoyment of the music; through an enjoy-
ment of being part of a crowd of people with whom, 
temporarily, one can feel at one; through the feelings of 
competency and bodily expressiveness that dancing can 
give you; through the sharing of a special place and time 
with friends; through behaving in ways one cannot in 
other social situations, for example at work. Perversely, 
though, this fun needs to be taken seriously. We need to 
understand the playfulness of such consumption. We 
need to analyze the complicated micro-spatial practices 
through which this play is enacted; the ways in which one 
gets to feel, and enjoy being, part of the clubbing crowd; 
the ways in which one dances so as to lose oneself in the 
music. We need to grasp the importance of place to play-
ful consumption; the ways in which one has to be in the 
right place, with the right music and the right crowd, 
to have these feelings of exhilaration, communality and 
vitality; the way that in such consumption ‘the empha-
sis is placed on the near and the affectual: that which 
unites one to a place, a place that is experienced among 
others’ (Maffesoli 1996: 128). And we need to appreciate 
small-scale, trivial resistances that people enact, their 
refusal to be just consumers in the sense of purchasers, 
their determination to use this space for their own ends. 
And that too has a wider symbolism, signalling the pos-
sibility that consumption is rarely just about what we are 
being sold, but also about fulfilling our own needs for 
social affiliation, participation and place making.
19.3.2 Economies of experience: skateboarding 
and dancing
Shopping is not just about buying goods, then; it is a 
placed experience. More generally, a range of research 
has framed consumption as experiential. For some, this 
involves understanding consumption as a resistant act in 
which we, as consumers, creatively use the places made 
for us. Writing from the discipline of architecture, Iain 
Borden (2001) pursues this approach in a study of skate-
boarding, space and the city. Paying particular attention 
to ‘street skating’, he argues that skateboarders remake 
urban spaces designed for other purposes: sometimes 
explicitly symbolic monumental space (e.g. town halls, 
national theatres, historical monuments, tourist attrac-
tions); but more often everyday spaces of neglect, the 
left-overs of rational, economically focused planning (e.g. 
mini-roundabouts, the spaces under bridges and urban 
highways, mini-malls). Thus spaces of public, official 
symbolism and of arid architectural functionality become 
the stages for energetic practices of place consumption. 
Handrails become tools for ‘ollie nose grinds’; cement 
banks opportunities for ‘shredding’. Skaters consume 
the city with their boards, recomposing it in the process. 
Skateboarding enacts a way of consuming the city that 
precisely emphasizes use over commercial or other val-
ues. The city becomes a site of play, of skillful embodied

social structure that produces the coffee, the economic 
impact of coffee production on the Colombian economy, 
or the way coffee growing affects the Colombian environ-
ment’ (Sack 1992: 200). Such ignorance, he argues, makes 
it impossible for consumers to behave responsibly in rela-
tion to those involved in commodity production and dis-
tribution. Unless we know about the origins of the goods 
we consume, then we lack the necessary understanding to 
assess the impacts of our actions as consumers; without 
such understanding of consequences, responsible action 
is impossible. Thus, modern consumption’s disconnected 
geographies make it deeply amoral.
One critical response to such ignorance and amoral-
ity is to see consumers as blinded by a veil that is draped 
over the things we consume, through a process of what 
Marx called ‘commodity fetishism’. In this portrait the 
true history or biography of a product, and its basis in 
the productive work of others, is obscured to consumers. 
Instead, one is confronted by advertising imagery that 
seeks to associate the product with other fantasy worlds. 
The critical response to this situation is often to punc-
ture these fantasies with some sharp shafts of reality, to 
‘de-­fetishise’ the commodity. Writing in the 1990s, Elaine 
Hartwick points to the startling incongruities and ine-
qualities that such a puncturing can bring to light:
Michael Jordan, basketball player extraordinaire, 
receives US$20 million a year to endorse Nike; Philip 
Knight, cofounder and chief executive officer of Nike, 
is worth US$5.4 billion; Indonesian workers are paid 
US$2.40 a day and Vietnamese workers are paid 
US$10.00 a week to make the sneakers . . . The Walt 
Disney Company is publicly criticized for its treat-
ment of Haitian workers making Pocahontas shirts 
for 28 cents an hour; Disney’s chief executive officer 
makes US$78,000 a day.
(Hartwick 1998: 423)
Hartwick’s suggestion is to approach consumption in 
terms of ‘commodity chains’. Here she draws on a much 
wider body of scholarship (see Hughes and Reimer 2004) 
to argue for what she terms a ‘geoknowledge’ of con-
sumption, one that traces back the stuff we consume 
through the links in a provision chain, eventually con-
necting consumers to producers. Such knowledge, she 
argues, allows a ‘geoethics’ of consumption, attuned to 
the politics of the economic systems upon which con-
sumption depends.
Smith’s account of Starbucks Coffee shops makes a 
similar ‘de-fetishisation’ argument. He highlights how 
unfairly traded coffee sees only 25 per cent of the retail 
price returning to the producing country, with even 
less going to those who actually cultivate the crop (the 
the wider significance of such playful consumption for 
our productions of local experience, such that consumer 
culture is not just made up of atomistic, avaristic indi-
vidual consumers, but also facilitates temporary, some 
would say ‘neo-tribal’, gatherings, through which people 
come to feel part of something bigger than themselves 
(see Maffesoli 1996: 72–103).
Clubbing is, then, a place-specific practice of con-
sumption. Whereas in the shopping centre or with street 
skateboarding senses of communal belonging tend to be 
forged by those occupying space for purposes other than 
those for which it was designed, in clubs that commu-
nal belonging is the very product that people are buying. 
Clubs may be distinctive places of consumption, charac-
terized by an exceptional emotional and bodily intensity, 
but they also point to wider trends within the so-called 
‘experience economy’ towards localized places of theatri-
cal consumption.
19.4 Consumption and geographies 
of (dis)connection
In this final section of the chapter we discuss the wider 
implications of our everyday practices of consumption. 
Our focus in particular is on how consumers are both 
connected to, but often feel disconnected from, the other 
people and places involved in providing the things we 
consume.
Consumption may often feel mundane, or perhaps not 
serious enough to matter that much, but it has profound 
political and economic implications. In the words of 
Danny Miller, the figure of ‘the consumer’ has become a 
sort of ‘global dictator’: ‘Today, real power lies unequivo-
cally with us, that is the waged consumers of the First 
World’ (1995: 10). In consequence, opposing the study of 
consumption because so many in the world are not afflu-
ent consumers is profoundly misplaced. Quoting Miller 
again, ‘The acknowledgement of consumption need not 
detract from the critique of inequality and exploitation, 
but this critique is foundering precisely because the enor-
mous consequences and attractions of consumption are 
left out of the analysis’ (ibid.: 21). A fundamental chal-
lenge for the twenty-first century is to fashion economic 
forms that fulfil those attractions of consumption, but 
deal too with its consequences.
19.4.1 Dis-connections
In Robert Sack’s view, we consumers are profoundly igno-
rant of the geographies of provision that bring goods to 
us: ‘A shop that sells Colombian coffee does not reveal the 

392    Section 4  Geographies of the economy
them. A recent example is the letter found in a Saks Fifth 
Avenue shopping bag in New York from Tohnain Emma-
nuel Njong, a Cameroon national making them in a Chi-
nese prison who wanted a consumer to know about the 
terrible conditions in which he was forced to work and 
to help his story to be told (Kelleher and Cook 2014b).
Finally, there are the apparently accidental traces of 
producers’ work that are left in and on commodities 
for consumers to discover. Perhaps the most famous of 
these happened in 2009, when photos of a quality control 
worker in a Chinese electronics factory were found on a 
new iPhone when it was first turned on by a consumer 
in the UK. He posted them online with a note asking if 
anyone else had found photos like this on their phones. 
The story then went viral with countless people around 
the world posting their opinions about who she was, why 
the photos had been taken and left on the phone, and 
what would happen to her now she could be identified as 
having left them there (Cook 2011d).
Naomi Klein (2000) notes how the power of global 
brands, combined with their concern for their sign 
values, has generated a political response – a ‘brand 
­boomerang’ – in which the meanings being promoted 
in marketing discourses are contested by other stories, 
often centred on the social relations of production. In 
recent years, these contestations have increasingly taken 
place online via websites, blogs and social media-based 
‘marketing’ strategies working in parallel to those used 
by corporations (Baringhorst et al. 2009). Using relatively 
non-specialist on- and offline tools and networks, jour-
nalists and activists have been able quickly and vividly 
to highlight, hijack and call into question large corpora-
tions’ neglect of the health, safety and wages of farmers, 
factory workers and others making their branded goods. 
This work is said to be responsible for some corporations’ 
apparent turn towards more transparent and ethical busi-
ness practices. One notable example is what happened 
after the Hong Kong based NGO Students and Scholars 
Against Corporate Misbehaviour (SACOM) hijacked 
Apple’s carefully planned launch of the iPad in 2010 (see 
Case study 19.2).
19.4.2 Ethical Consumption
These academic, journalist, activist and other attempts 
at reconnecting consumers and producers speak to a 
wider consumer movement, that of ‘ethical consump-
tion’. Here, consumption is explicitly cast in relation to 
wider provisioning systems and their human and non-
human participants, of which the consumer is a part (for 
a general introduction, see Lewis and Potter 2011). Green 
consumerism, fair trade, vegetarianism and other animal 
welfare concerns would be principal strands.
smallholders, waged workers and seasonal pickers). He 
contrasts the stylish coffee-shop culture that a brand like 
Starbucks epitomizes with the lives of those who produce 
coffee. For the women who pick the coffee beans, their 
working day begins somewhere between three and four 
in the morning. Getting back home at six in the evening, 
they still have evening meals to prepare, water to fetch 
from the river, a family to feed and clear up after. Few live 
in houses with electricity or running water. They face a 
major health hazard from the pesticides used on the cof-
fee plants (M.D. Smith 1996: 512–13). Other academic 
accounts profess a more open reading of the juxtaposi-
tions of different moments and places in a commodity’s 
life (see Cook and Woodyer 2012). Cook’s ‘followings’ of 
foods – particularly the papaya - provide vivid examples 
of what is possible here (Cook et al. 2004, 2006).
It is not just academic accounts that look to make 
apparent the often hidden relations between the produc-
ers and consumers of commodities. The spoof shopping 
website followthethings.com documents over 60 exam-
ples of ‘follow the thing’ work by journalists, filmmak-
ers, artists, activists and others. There are a number of 
serious documentary films here including: Dziga Ver-
tov’s (1924) Kino Eye, which involves reverse-action 
sequences following beef steaks back to pasture lands in 
Russia (Cook 2011a); and Mark Phillips’ (1997) Mange 
Tout, which follows a UK supermarket buyer as he vis-
its a farm producing mangetout peas in Zimbabwe and 
asks packing house workers to trim them differently ‘for 
the consumer’ (Cook 2011b). There are bitingly funny 
activist films, like Amnesty International’s (2006) spoof 
Teleshopping advert in which shopping channel demon-
strators show how easy it is for children to buy and kill 
people with AK-47 rifles (Livingston 2011), and Emily 
James’ (2002) film The Luckiest Nut in the World, in 
which an animated American peanut sings country and 
western songs about the international trade rules which 
favour him over other nuts grown commercially outside 
the USA (Cook 2011c).
There are commodities reworked and made afresh 
by artists and activists. Examples include: the bottles of 
‘B’eau Pal’ mineral water (‘bottled at source’) produced 
by the Bhopal Medical Appeal and the YesMen in 2009 
for delivery to the UK headquarters of Dow Chemical 
whom they wanted to pay compensation to the victims 
of the 1984 Bhopal chemical factory explosion (Parkin 
2013); and the labels found in Primark clothing in 2014 
saying ‘Degrading Sweatshop Conditions’ and ‘Exhaust-
ing Hours’ which were believed to have been sewn in to 
them by an artist/activist who then returned them to the 
store for re-sale (Kelleher and Cook 2014a). There are 
the ‘real’ letters found in commodities that were written 
by the people who made them to the people who bought

Case study 19.2 
Timeline: the iPad – ‘a gadget to 
die for?’
San Francisco, 27 January 2010: at an invitation-
only event, Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveils a thin, 
light, aluminium and glass ‘multi-touch’ tablet media 
player called the iPad. It is, he claims, a ‘magical and 
revolutionary device’ which ‘creates and defines an 
entirely new category of devices that will connect 
users and their apps and content in a much more 
intimate, intuitive and fun way than ever before’ (in 
Apple 2010a). A video of his presentation is posted on 
the Apple website, YouTube and elsewhere, and the 
iPad features in news stories worldwide.
Online, 31 March–1 April 2010: iPads distributed 
to a small, select ‘inner circle’ in advance of their sale 
are reviewed in mainstream North American media 
­outlets – like Time magazine – and on specialist 
blogs – like boinboing.net. Readers submit hundreds of 
online comments in response, and these reviews are 
read, commented upon, and written about worldwide.
USA, 3 April 2010: the iPad goes on sale. Reports 
describe people queuing for days to be the first to get 
one in store. Customer reviews quickly appear online 
and in the press.
San Francisco, 3 May 2010: Apple announces that 
one million iPads have been sold. Jobs states that 
‘Demand continues to exceed supply and we’re working 
hard to get this magical product into the hands of even 
more customers’ (in Apple 2010b).
Hong Kong, 25 May 2010: SACOM publish a report 
and lead a group of protesters performing traditional 
Chinese funeral rights at the headquarters of the Fox-
conn Corporation. The report details a series of ten 
suicide attempts (eight ‘successful’) since the begin-
ning of 2010 by young factory workers employed by

Foxconn in Shenzhen City’s Longuhua Science and 
Technology Park. Foxconn is China’s biggest exporter 
and, with 300,000 assembly workers, this is the largest 
factory in the world. Local press reports attribute the 
suicide attempts to ‘overwork’, ‘too much pressure’ and 
‘unstable emotions’ resulting from the factory regime. 
TV news bulletins in China show security camera foot-
age of one 24-year-old victim ‘walking unsteadily out 
onto the roof of a Foxconn building on the way to her 
death’ (Moore 2010). An ongoing series of TV news 
reports about ‘Foxconn suicides’ – in Chinese, English 
and with English subtitles – are posted on YouTube. By 
the time SACOM’s report is published, Foxconn work-
ers at Longhua Park have already assembled two mil-
lion iPads (alongside Nintendo Wiis, Nokia cellphones 
and other popular consumer electronic devices). The 
report suggests that Apple’s marketing campaign 
and the enthusiastic take-up of iPads by US consum-
ers contributed to the suicides by sending ‘extreme 
pressure all the way down to [Apple’s] Chinese suppli-
ers’ (Chan 2010: 5).
UK, 27 May 2010: the front page of a UK national 
newspaper brings the two strands of this story together 
in a starkly visual way (Hickman 2010a). Beneath the 
headline – ‘A gadget to die for?’ – is a photograph of 
two objects in a spotlight. They're the same size and 
shape. One is an iPad. The other is a framed photo of 
a young Chinese man. The text beneath one reads, 
‘This is the iPad, the most eagerly awaited consumer 
product of the year, available in the UK from tomorrow’. 
The text beneath the other reads, ‘This is Ma Xiang-
qian, driven to suicide, the latest victim of “inhuman” 
conditions in Asia’s electronics factories’. His suicide is 
detailed in SACOM’s report, and his family takes this 
framed photograph with them to protest and mourn 
the Foxconn deaths. Hundreds more mainstream and 
online media stories link the iPad to the ‘Foxconn sui-
cides’ over the following days, weeks and months.
Worldwide, 28 May 2010: after delays caused by 
massive sales in the USA, the iPad goes on sale in 
Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
Spain, Switzerland and the UK (Apple 2010c). Similar 
scenes, stories, reviews, comments and discussions 
are reported in the press.
San Francisco, 2 June 2010: Jobs claims the 
Foxconn factory is not a ‘sweatshop’, that its suicide 
rate is lower than the USA’s, and that Apple is ‘on top’ 
of the situation (Beaumont 2010). A worker dies there 
after working a 34-hour shift.
Shenzhen, 3 June 2010: Foxconn raises basic 
Shenzhen factory wages by a third.
Hong Kong, 8 June 2010: SACOM declares this 
day the ‘Global Day of Remembrance for Victims of 
Foxconn’, protests outside a Foxconn shareholder 
meeting, and hands over a petition endorsed by ‘more 
than 5,000 organizations and individuals from over 100 
countries’ (SACOM 2010 np).
Shenzhen, 9 June 2010: Foxconn is reported to be 
‘employing psychologists, punchbags for prostrated 
workers . . . and safety nets around its roofs to stop 
workers leaping from them’ (Harding 2010, np).
Shenzhen, 10 June 2010: Foxconn pay rises 
encourage workers in other Chinese factories to strike for 
higher pay.
Shenzhen, 11 June 2010: Foxconn is reported to 
have recruited monks and social workers to help work-
ers with their problems, and to have compelled workers 
to sign contracts promising not to sue Foxconn as a 
result of ‘any unexpected death or injury, including sui-
cide or self-torture’ (Malone and Jones 2010 np).
USA, 12 June 2010: an Apple fan called Mike Daisey 
returns from talking to Foxconn workers in preparation 
for a monologue show about Steve Jobs and concludes, 
‘It’s painful to realize that these things you love so much 
have blood on them’ (in McKeon 2010 np).
China, 6 July 2010: Chinese factory workers are 
reported to have been following this press cover-
age online, to be coordinating strike action via social 
networking websites, and to be gaining pay rises as a 
result of their actions.
UK, 16 July 2010: journalist Leo Hickman (2010b, 
np) argues that Apple is no longer the ‘creative, edgy 
innovator that launched the iPod in 2001’, and that 
the reputation of the ‘entertainment and information 
colossus’ has crumbled.
Washington DC, 20 July 2010: the premiere of 
Mike Daisey’s The Agony and the Ecstasy of  Steve 
Jobs takes place in the Wooly Mammoth Theatre. This 
becomes a controversial, high-profile critique of Jobs’ 
company. Two years later, one reviewer describes it 
as ‘the play that shook Apple and has compelled labor 
reforms in China’ (Anonymous 2012, np).
China, 22 July 2010: Foxconn workers are reported 
to have been offered two pay rises in June which could 
more than double their pay, the company increased 
its prices to clients to cover increasing wage costs, 
the wave of strikes in China’s coastal industrial cit-
ies continued, and Foxconn was said to be increasing 
automated production and moving low-margin produc-
tion to new, lower-wage factories inland.

Chapter 19  Consumption and its geographies    395
In ethical consumption, being a consumer is not 
opposed to being a political actor or a citizen. Rather, 
consumption is seen as a realm for political agency. 
However, the motivations, forms and implications of 
such agency cannot be assumed. Ethical consumption is 
not as simple as correcting the ignorances and amoral-
ity of most consumers through more accurate informa-
tion about the origins of products. This is so in at least  
three ways.
First, we have argued that consumption is an arena for 
the production, circulation and reception of geographi-
cal knowledges. It is tempting for Geography academics 
and students to respond by looking to export the factual 
knowledge of our subject to this everyday arena, in order 
to correct the ignorances that we all operate under as con-
sumers. But that, we suggest, is both too easy – offering a 
very simplistic account of both geographical knowledge 
and the politics of consumption – and impossibly diffi-
cult, given the complex histories and geographies of the 
multitude of things we consume (Cook et al. 2007). Just 
think, for example, about how many component parts 
your mobile phone has, how many hands those parts and 
their constituent materials have been through. To detail 
these would take many thousands of words; to find out 
about them many hours, days, maybe even months of 
research. Even the most committed ethical consumers 
therefore rely on shorthand rationales, whether that be 
guidance from those judged to be experts on appropri-
ate ethical actions, recognized audits of ethical standards 
(e.g. through certification schemes such as Fairtrade, 
organic or animal welfare), or adverts that present ethi-
cal products (with their carefully managed, and often 
romanticized, representations of producers; see Wright 
2004 and Zick Varul 2008). Ethical consumption is not 
about a simple transparency; it still involves the repre-
sentation of commodity production and its relations to 
consumers (Goodman 2004).
Second, studies of ethical consumption also suggest 
that its existent forms stem as much from personal his-
tories and collective organizations of political action as 
they do from the decisions of better informed consum-
ers (Barnett et al. 2005, 2011; Clarke et al. 2007; Clarke 
2008). In consequence, ethical consumption practice is 
as much a matter of political organization, and collec-
tive regulation, as it is of individual product choices. In 
turn, those forms of regulation operate within complex 
political fields where the interests of a range of interest 
groups have to be negotiated and may compete. Produc-
ers may, and do, find ethical regulation an imposition 
upon them by powerful consumer interests; corporate 
actors, such as supermarket retailers, may use ethical 
concerns to reinforce their role of speaking for consum-
ers and dictating terms to producers (Cook et al. 2000b; 
Freidberg 2003). The politics of ethical consumption are 
complex.
Third, a preoccupation with the dark side of consump-
tion – to put it crudely, with suffering, injustice, and our 
responsibility for it – is too partial. Rather than articu-
lating worlds of consumption and production, it can end 
up dismissing worlds of consumption and their positive 
possibilities altogether. It is not a coincidence that Hart-
wick’s (1998) commodity chain approach pays no atten-
tion to consumption per se. The danger of that limited 
view is that consumption is framed as unequivocally bad. 
That is neither true, as hopefully the discussions earlier in 
this chapter have demonstrated, nor terribly attractive in 
shaping political action. Particularly if one’s own worlds 
of production, as a worker, are thoroughly unrewarding – 
admittedly not usually the case for academic critics of 
consumption, but true for many others – then giving up 
all the pleasures of consumption is pretty hard to stom-
ach. Certainly the last three decades in Western politics 
suggest that failing to recognize the genuine senses of 
autonomy and creativity that consumption can facilitate 
is a sure way to alienate those very same workers in whose 
name one wishes to re-centre the world of production 
(Miller 2001).
The pleasures and responsibilities of consumption do 
not have to be opposed in this way. There are connections 
to be made. Early empirical research on ethical consum-
ers in London challenged any sense of ethical consump-
tion as joyless moral prescription (Bedford 1999), instead 
emphasizing the positive pleasures gained through such 
consumer movements: the feelings of achievement, the 
senses of empowerment, the forms of sociality fostered 
(see also Barnett et al. 2011: 153–80). What is more, much 
routine consumption has a moral core, centred on caring 
for one’s nearest and dearest. Ethical consumption looks 
to extend the reach of such a consuming sensibility. We 
consumers are both global dictators and local freedom 
fighters. Understanding and inhabiting those two roles in 
conjunction remains a significant challenge.

Section 5
Political geographies:
geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship 
and governance
Edited by James Sidaway

Those who have reached this section after reading 
other chapters should already be aware that many 
elements of geography touch on political issues. 
Such ‘politics’ may not be confined to those things 
that are usually designated by the term: govern-
ments, elections, referendums (or the lack of 
them), political parties, revolutions, territorial con-
flicts and so on. Rather, readers will have noticed 
that debates about culture, economic change, his-
tory, changing gender relations and many other 
things described in this text are also political. They 
are political in the sense of being about power, 
albeit at different levels and in lots of different 
ways. So, in an important way, all geographies are 
political geographies. Though focused on geopoli-
tics territory, nation-states and global governance, 
the chapters that follow aim to bring that home. 
Chapter 20 examines the meanings of geopolitics. 
It will explore how geopolitics has been defined in 
different times and places: including South Amer-
ica in the second half of the twentieth century, Ger-
many, some other European countries and Japan 
before and during the Second World War as well 
as through the Cold War confrontation between 
the Soviet Union and the USA, the ‘global war 
on terror’ of the 2000s to contemporary debates 
about the rise and role of China; all building on 
the moment when geopolitics was first established 
as a way of understanding (and indeed seeking to 
influence) world politics, in early twentieth-century 
Europe. As the chapter describes, when consider-
ing what geopolitics might mean today and in the 
future, these pasts are mobilized and reworked.
Chapter 21 examines ‘territory’; the ways that 
human individuals and social groups claim or 
are assigned to particular areas: in short, the 
human territorial strategies which regulate, demar-
cate and divide social and political spaces, and 
their uses. Whilst this is perhaps most clearly 
expressed in the form of the political geography of 
nations and states and their boundaries (the focus 
of Chapter 22), Chapter 21 stresses that territoriality 
operates in myriad ways and at local scales: for 
example, in the manner in which particular areas 
within many cities become associated with differ-
ent ethnicities (as in the history of urban ghettos 
and city ‘quarters’ or other places that are seen 
as being overwhelmingly white – such as many 
rural areas in Britain) or, more widely, in the ways 
that some spaces are seen as public and oth-
ers private or as male and female. Readers will 
therefore find many connections with earlier sec-
tions of the book here. Chapter 22 introduces the 
historical and geographical variability of nations 
and states. It stresses that neither the nation nor 
the state is to be taken at face value. Or in other 
words, it examines how nation-states are complex 
symbolic systems that crucially depend upon par-
ticular visions and associations of territory, place 
and space. Chapter 23 focuses on citizenship: the 
relationship between individuals and political units 
(largely, but not only states).
The last chapter in the book should be read in 
tandem with the others in this section. Its consid-
eration of the geographies of global governance 
also connects with many others in the book. In 
particular, it is easy to see how Chapter 24 relates 
to issues of population, resources, development 
and the environment that are considered in Sec-
tion 2. In the relationships with culture, nature and 
cities, the links to Section 3 are evident, but so too 
are those with the economic and financial geog-
raphies described in Section 4. And it is not hard 
to appreciate how the present and future of all 
the issues considered in this section derive from 
the historical geographies examined in Section 1. 
Such interconnections are part of what makes a 
geographical approach so inviting and exciting.

Geopolitical traditions
Chapter 20
Few modern ideologies are as whimsically all-encompassing, as roman-
tically obscure, as intellectually sloppy, and as likely to start a third 
world war as the theory of ‘geopolitics’. Popularized at the beginning 
of the twentieth century by an eccentric British geographer, Sir Halford 
Mackinder, geopolitics posits that the earth will forever be divided into 
two naturally antagonistic spheres: land and sea. In this model, the 
natural repository for global land power is the Eurasian ‘heartland’ – the 
territory of the former Russian empire. Whoever controls the heartland, 
wrote Mackinder, will forever seek to dominate the Eurasian landmass 
and ultimately the world.
(Charles Clover 1999: 9)

20.1 Introducing the idea of a 
­geopolitical tradition
Geopolitical rhetoric is more popular than ever. Writ-
ing in the (London-based newspaper) Financial Times 
in May 2015, China’s ambassador to Britain began his 
article on how China’s growing power and investments 
should not be seen as threatening, with a note about how 
‘A century ago, Sir Halford Mackinder, the British geog-
rapher and politician credited as the father of western 
geopolitics’ had coined ideas about power and space in 
Eurasia that ‘captivated generations of geo-strategists 
who saw Eurasia as the “heartland” of the world’s most 
populous and pivotal region’ (Liu 2015: 9).
Ambassador Liu noted that new Chinese proposals for 
enhanced transport and trade links connecting Europe 
and Asia were being misinterpreted by some as confirm-
ing Mackinder’s theories. Instead he stressed the shared 
benefits of ‘development and prosperity’ from Chinese 
initiatives, arguing that ‘the Chinese mind is never pro-
grammed around geopolitical or geoeconomic theory’ 
(op cit.). Some beg to differ, however, and as the closing 
section of this chapter details, Chinese actions are fre-
quently interpreted through geopolitical lenses.
But what does geopolitics mean? Our answer is 
that whilst the term can and does refer to many things, 
and is much in vogue, it is important for students of 
geography (a subject with which geopolitics has often 
been associated) to understand that geopolitics is com-
monly associated with particular ways of writing (and 
thinking) about space, states and the relations between 
them. Often this takes the form of mapping, emphasiz-
ing the strategic importance of particular places (as in 
Figures 20.1 or 20.3). Geopolitics in this sense often sees 
itself as a tradition: that is, something conscious of its 
unfolding historical development and with a sense of 
important founders (and certain key texts written by 
them). Many of those who write about this tradition or 
see themselves as working within or extending it usually 
trace its origins to the late-nineteenth-century writings 
of a conservative Swedish politician Rudolf Kjellén. 
Kjellén is reputedly the first person to have used the 
term ‘geopolitics’ in published writings (see Holdar 
1992; Tunander 2001). But beyond this idea of a found-
ing moment when the geopolitical ‘tradition’ begins 
with the first use of the term by Kjellén, things start to 
get complicated. The ‘tradition’ divides, fractures, mul-
tiplies and finds itself translated into many languages 
and cropping up in everything from the writings and 
speeches of American politicians to texts written by 
Brazilian generals and Russian journalists. All these 
reinvent and rework the ‘tradition’ as they go along. As 
the introduction to a critical collection on ‘rethinking 
geopolitics’ explained:
the word ‘geopolitics’ has had a long and varied his-
tory in the twentieth century, moving well beyond its 
original meaning in Kjellén’s work . . . . Coming up 
with a specific definition of geopolitics is notoriously 
difficult, for the meaning of concepts like geopolitics 
tends to change as historical periods and structures of 
world order change.
(Ó Tuathail 1998: 1)
In other words, exactly what is meant by the term 
‘geopolitics’ has changed in different historical and geo-
graphical contexts. However, a good way to begin to 
understand something about this idea of a tradition of 
geopolitics is to look at some of the people, places and 
ideas associated with one of its most significant appear-
ances, in the ideology of the right-wing dictatorships 
that ruled many South American countries in the 1960s, 
1970s and 1980s. In most cases they had come to power 
through military coups and became more concerned with 
internal security (patrolling the towns and country as a 
kind of police force and running the wider government) 
than with fighting or preparing to fight wars with other 
countries.
Consider the case of Chile. On 11 September 1973, 
the elected left-wing government of Chile (headed by the 
communist President Salvador Allende) was overthrown 
in a brutally violent coup led by the head of the armed 
forces General Augusto Pinochet (Plate 20.1). Pinochet 
and his generals ruled Chile with an iron fist. All opposi-
tion was crushed and thousands of people were rounded 
up by the armed forces. Many ‘disappeared’ into secret 
military jails. Hundreds of these prisoners were tor-
tured and murdered. The use of torture became a rou-
tine instrument of state. For the next 17 years, Chile was 
ruled by Pinochet and his cronies who imposed a new 
‘neoliberal’ economic and political model (of the form 
that is described in Chapter 8) and murdered any signifi-
cant opposition. Pinochet finally stepped down as head 
of state in 1990, when democracy was restored, but not 
before he had entrenched himself as a senator (in the 
parliament) for life; he died from heart failure in 2006, 
aged 91.
The ideology of the military regime in Chile (like 
those elsewhere in South America) was intensely nation-
alist. More importantly it was a particular conservative 
form of Chilean nationalism. The nation was held to be 
sacred and the military were rescuing this ‘sacred body’ 
from communists, subversives and so on (i.e. anyone 
who opposed the military vision of ultra-nationalism 
and order and the neoliberal economic and social model 
which was now imposed). It is in this nationalism and 

Chapter 20  Geopolitical traditions    401
space’ (a certain amount of resources and land) for the 
nation to thrive is particularly evident in South American 
geopolitics. A certain reading of Charles Darwin’s idea 
of a struggle for the ‘survival of the fittest’ is therefore 
transferred to the realm of states. Drawing upon con-
servative German writings of the nineteenth and early 
twentieth century and with this organic notion of the 
state in mind, geopolitics claims to identify certain laws 
that govern state behaviour and that, once identified, can 
be a guide for those charged with furthering and protect-
ing the ‘national interest’ (or at least a certain definition 
of the latter).
It is not difficult to see how this idea could appeal to 
South American military dictators, for it gives the mili-
tary, equipped with the supposedly scientific study of 
geopolitics, a special mission. In other words it legiti-
mizes their rule. Moreover, the organic idea was extended 
further to legitimize the extermination of those whom 
the military defined as enemies of the state. People 
labelled as communist or subversive, indeed all those who 
oppose the military dictatorship, can be compared with 
a disease or cancer which threatens the lifeblood of the 
state-organism and is best ‘cut out’, that is, eliminated. 
The otherwise unthinkable (the murder of thousands of 
people in the name of the wider welfare of the nation-
state) is made to seem natural and a good thing, since it 
serves the longer-term interest of the health and power 
of the ‘living being’ that is the state (see Hepple 1992 for 
an exploration of this). With the ‘cancer’ of subversion 
and disloyalty eliminated, the ‘state-body’ can go on to 
grow and thrive.
20.3 Brazilian national integration
Aside from Chile (and neighbour Argentina, of which 
more will be said in Section 20.4), perhaps the most 
important expressions of geopolitics in South America 
were in Brazil. The military in Brazil overthrew the demo-
cratic government in 1964 and stayed in power for the next 
20 years. Although never as despotic as the regime led by 
Pinochet (or similar military governments in Argentina 
and Uruguay), the long years of military rule gave the 
Brazilian generals a chance to elaborate and impose a 
geopolitical vision on the country. One of the most evi-
dent aspects of Brazilian geopolitics is the idea that state 
security requires a measure of national integration. The 
vast scale of Brazil, the difficulty of travel across its Ama-
zon ‘heartland’ (the world’s largest tropical rainforest) 
and the fact that it shares borders with every other South 
American country except Chile and Ecuador gave the 
geopolitics of the Brazilian generals a special sense of its 
conception of the nation as a kind of sacred body that 
geopolitics enters the picture. A few years before the coup, 
Pinochet had published an army textbook on geopolitics. 
Intended mainly for use in Chilean military academies, 
the 1968 textbook indicated that Chile’s future dictator 
took the subject very seriously. For Pinochet, geopoli-
tics was a science of the state, a set of knowledges and 
programmes to perfect the art of statecraft, that is to 
strengthen the state in a continent and wider world in 
which it was held to be in competition with others. The 
starting point and the heart of Pinochet’s textbook and 
of the wider bleak tradition of geopolitics that it presents 
is an organic theory of the state.
20.2 The organic theory of the state
This idea is at the core of most South American geopo-
litical writings and of the wider geopolitical tradition. In 
summary, it holds that the state or country (and the sense 
of nation that goes with it) is best understood as being 
like a living being. Like any living organism, it therefore 
needs space to grow and it will be in competition with 
other living beings. An idea that the state needs ‘living

have also moved into the Amazon region in search of 
land and freedom. They are fleeing from the oppression 
and landlessness they themselves face in the north-east 
of Brazil, where the vast majority of the land is still in 
the hands of an elite class. Of course, in the geopolitical 
visions of the Brazilian generals, this population move-
ment was seen as overwhelmingly positive, reinforcing 
the Brazilian population of the Amazon and redistrib-
uting what they regard as marginal ‘surplus’ people in 
the process (in much the same way that the coloniza-
tion of the ‘wild west’ was seen as the advance of civi-
lization and America’s ‘manifest destiny’ in the United 
States). At the same time this has defused some of the 
political pressures for land reform in north-east Bra-
zil. In all this we can see how Brazilian geopolitics was 
implicated in a complex web of social and environmental 
transformations.
20.4 Antarctic obsessions
An interest, at times an obsession, with the last unex-
ploited continent of Antarctica is evident in much South 
national mission and an obsession with the potential for 
the country to be a great power (known in Portuguese as 
Grandeza). The associated sense of the urgency of the 
integration of Brazil required the extension of a network 
of highways across Amazonia and the settlement of its 
lands by farmers and ranchers. It is this geopolitically 
inspired vision, combined with a highly corrupt system 
of patronage and favours to those close to the regime, 
that underlies the enclosure and division of Amazonia 
into private lands (some larger than European countries 
such as Belgium) and the accompanying transformation 
or destruction of the tropical rainforest (see Hecht and 
Cockburn 1989; Foresta 1992) (Figure 20.1).
Although the Brazilian military have been back in the 
barracks for more than three decades and Brazil is again 
a lively democracy, the long-term consequences of this 
geopolitically motivated (and economically profitable) 
strategy have been disastrous for many of the indige-
nous peoples of Amazonia. They have found themselves 
forced off land that was traditionally theirs, sometimes 
murdered or attacked by ranchers, the state and settlers, 
and disoriented by the arrival of a frontier culture of 
violence, destruction and consumption. Poor peasants, 
particularly from the impoverished north-east of Brazil,

Atlantic], but also to. . .  national sovereignty, patriot-
ism, and pride. This is a particularly touchy combi-
nation after the humiliating defeat of the Malvinas/
Falklands conflict. The Argentine National Antarctic 
Directorate has professors of Antarctic geopolitics on 
its staff. Through the media, maps, and postage stamps 
and the centralized educational system, Argentines 
are constantly taught and reminded that there is an 
Argentine Antarctic just as much as there are Argen-
tine Malvinas. The need to assert Argentine rights in 
the Argentine Sea, islands, and Antarctica is linked to 
dreams and national projects of Argentine greatness.
20.5 Heartland
Although Antarctica and the South Atlantic are signifi-
cant components of Argentine (along with Brazilian and 
Chilean) geopolitics, the former also looks beyond other 
Argentine frontiers. In particular, Argentine geopoliti-
cal writers together with some Brazilians and Chileans 
have taken a particular interest in the security of Bolivia. 
They have scripted Bolivia (a relatively impoverished 
land-locked mountainous country, which has borders 
with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Peru) and 
proximate areas of its neighbours as a key strategic con-
tinental heartland (see Kelly 1997). Control of Bolivia, 
in this vision, would be a vital key to a relative domi-
nance in the South American continent. That Bolivia has 
a strong revolutionary tradition and was for many years 
characterized by chronic political instability has rein-
forced the tendency of the other South American coun-
tries to meddle in Bolivian politics. Indeed, during the 
years (1976–82) when Argentina was last ruled by a geo-
politically obsessed military junta, the Argentine armed 
forces were actively involved in supporting a Bolivian 
military government. This activity took the form of the 
kinds of brutal suppression and frequent murder of those 
(trade union leaders, dissidents, opposition members and 
leaders) who opposed the military government and its 
economic and social strategies. The idea of Bolivia as a 
‘heartland’, control of which would be a kind of magic 
(geopolitical) key to domination of South America, 
links back to one of the best-known genres in classical 
(European) geopolitical thought. For although the South 
American countries have seen some of the most signifi-
cant expressions of geopolitical discourse of modern 
times, geopolitics originates in Europe and it is to some 
examples of European geopolitics, including the idea of 
heartland, that we now turn.
The designation of a heartland was first made by 
that British geographer (and strongly pro-imperialist 
American geopolitics. Antarctica is also prominent in 
geopolitical writings from Argentina, Chile and Uruguay 
and also appears in Peruvian, Brazilian and Ecuadorian 
geopolitical texts (see Dodds 1997). To understand what 
this amounts to and what forms it takes necessitates 
some understanding of Antarctica’s exceptional politi-
cal geography. Antarctica has a unique territorial status, 
in so far as it has no recognized state on its territory. 
Everywhere else in the world forms part of the patch-
work of states that we learn to be familiar with and take 
for granted. Antarctica is a stark reminder that there is 
nothing natural or inevitable about this. The absence of 
recognized states in Antarctica reflects the inhospitability 
and remoteness of the continent, the only one without an 
indigenous human population. Although the plankton-
rich waters around Antarctica were exploited for seal and 
whale hunting in the nineteenth century, it was not until 
the twentieth century that exploration of the interior 
began. Even today, Antarctica has only a non-permanent 
population (at any time) of a few hundred scientists. This 
presence, plus the relative proximity of the continent to 
South America and the possibility of exploitable min-
eral resources, has led to a series of territorial claims. 
Although Argentinean writers had already represented 
Antarctica as an extension of the southern Argentine area 
of Patagonia, the British made the first formal claim in 
1908. In turn, parts of this claim were ‘granted’ to Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. France and Norway made claims 
in the 1930s and 1940s, followed shortly by Argentina and 
Chile. After 1945, the USSR and the USA also established 
a wide network of bases, although without staking for-
mal claims to territory. The claims made by Argentina, 
Chile and the United Kingdom overlapped – and fore-
shadowing the British–Argentine conflict over the Falk-
lands/Malvinas, British and Argentine forces exchanged 
fire in Antarctica in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In the 
context of this potential for conflict and growing pos-
sibility of Cold War confrontation (on the Cold War, see 
Section 20.7), a United Nations Treaty in 1959 agreed that 
all claims would be (forgive the pun) ‘frozen’ for at least 
30 years, and the continent reserved for scientific (not 
commercial or military) use. The Treaty was extended in 
1991. But prior to then, it was not clear what the future 
status of the continent would be. Even today, the Treaty 
merely defers the issue of claims.
Argentina is the South American country with the 
largest claim (Figure 20.2). The Argentine claim has also 
become central to geopolitical discourse there. As Child 
(1985: 140–1) explains in a study of geopolitics and con-
flict in South America:
For Argentine geopolitical writers, the subject of Ant-
arctica is not only linked to tricontinental Argentina [a 
power in the South American continent and the South

Chapter 20  Geopolitical traditions    405
Mackinder’s writings reflect his place and time. Mack-
inder, writing from the vantage point of imperial Britain, 
is concerned to identify threats and dangers to British 
power. At the time when Mackinder presented his paper 
to the RGS, Britain was the pre-eminent world power. 
It still seemed that way to Mackinder in 1919 when he 
wrote about the ‘Heartland’. But British imperial politi-
cians, like Mackinder, were aware of the growing power 
of the United States of America, Germany and Russia. In 
fact, potential British imperial competition with the latter 
in Asia provided a key context to Mackinder’s work. As 
Peter Taylor (1994: 404) explained:
Behind every general model there is a specific case 
from which it is derived. For the heartland model this 
is particularly easy to identify. Throughout the second 
half of the nineteenth century Britain and Russia had 
been rivals in much of Asia. While Britain was consoli-
dating its hold on India and the route to India, Russia 
had been expanding eastwards and southwards pro-
ducing many zones of potential conflict from Turkey 
through Persia and Afghanistan to Tibet. But instead 
of war this became an arena of bluff and counter-
bluff, known as the ‘Great Game’. . . . Mackinder’s 
presentation to an audience at the Royal Geographi-
cal Society would not have seemed so original as it 
appears to us reading this paper today . . . . Put simply, 
the heartland model is a codification and globaliza-
tion of the Great Game: it brings a relatively obscure 
imperial contest on to centre stage.
Not only does this envisage the world in a particular 
way, as a ‘stage’, but it sees only select key actors as the 
significant figures at play. These are the European pow-
ers (plus Russia). Other peoples and places are merely 
the backdrop for action by White Men. The taken-for-
granted racism of Mackinder’s model, in which only 
Europeans make history, is also that of European imperi-
alism and that of the bulk of wider European geographi-
cal and historical writings of the time (see Chapter 3).
Yet, although Mackinder’s 1904 paper is very much 
a product of its time and Mackinder’s own conservative 
world-view, it has proven durable and has been integrated 
into rather different contexts, which saved it from the rel-
ative obscurity that it deserves as a turn-of-the-century 
imperialist text. The transfer of the discourse of ‘Heart-
land’ to Bolivia by South American codifiers of geopoli-
tics has already been noted. In addition, ‘Heartland’ was 
appropriated by German geopolitics in the 1930s and 
1940s and formed part of the backdrop to Cold War 
American strategy from the late 1940s through to the 
last decade of the twentieth century. Today it is widely 
read and debated in Russia and other countries of the 
former Soviet Union, such as Ukraine (Wilson 2002) and 
conservative politician) Halford Mackinder. In what 
has since become a widely cited article first published in 
1904 following its presentation to the Royal Geographical 
Society (RGS), Mackinder argued that the age of (Euro-
pean) geographical exploration was drawing to a close. 
This meant that there were hardly any unknown ‘blank’ 
spaces left on European maps of the world. According 
to Mackinder, the consequence of this closing of the 
map, this end of the centuries-long task of exploration 
and discovery, was that political events in one part of the 
world would invariably affect all others, to a much greater 
extent than hitherto. There would be no more frontiers 
for Europeans to explore and conquer. Instead, the great 
powers would now invariably collide with one another. 
Mackinder called this end of European exploration ‘the 
post-Columbian age’ and the closing of frontiers, the 
emergence of a ‘closed political system’.
Given that this was the case, Mackinder claimed to 
identify the places of greatest world-strategic signifi-
cance, control of which would give any great power a 
key to world power. In his 1904 paper, he termed this the 
‘pivot area’. With Mackinder’s address to the RGS and 
his subsequent article came a series of maps, the most 
frequently reprinted one of which claims to describe ‘The 
Natural Seats of Power’ (Figure 20.3). As Ó Tuathail’s 
(1996a: 25) critical account of Mackinder argues:
Mackinder’s January 25 [1904], address to the Royal 
Geographical Society, ‘The Geographical Pivot of His-
tory’, is generally considered to be a defining moment 
in the history of geopolitics, a text to which histories 
of geopolitics invariably point.
One of the key formulas in Mackinder’s notion of 
geographical determinism is his identification of a ‘pivot 
area’ or ‘heartland zone’ in east-central Europe, control 
of which would be a kind of magic key to world domi-
nation. Reworking the ideas of his 1904 article after the 
First World War, Mackinder refined this notion and 
penned a formula that encapsulated it:
Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland.
Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island.
Who rules the World-Island commands the world.
(Mackinder 1919: 4)
According to this (simplistic) formula, ‘rule’ of the 
eastern portion of Europe offered the strategic path to 
that of the African–Asian–European continents (which 
together constitute what Mackinder terms the ‘World-
Island’) and hence a dominant position on the world 
scene.

terms, in Italy under the fascist dictator Benito Musso-
lini, geopolitical journals saw themselves as serving and 
expressing the aspirations of the fascist state to establish 
a new Roman Empire across the Mediterranean (Figure 
20.5) (Antonsich 2009). However, it is the German geo-
politics of this epoch that has become the best-known. In 
Germany, organic notions of the state had already been 
popularized by conservative nineteenth-century academ-
ics. Moreover, Germany was characterized by extreme 
political and economic turbulence in the decades follow-
ing its defeat in the 1914–18 World War. This combina-
tion provided a fertile environment for the elaboration 
and circulation of a distinctive geopolitical tradition. In 
Ó Tuathail’s (1996a: 141) words:
After the shock of military defeat and the humilia-
tion of the dictated peace of Versailles, the Weimar 
Republic proved to be fertile ground for the growth of 
a distinct German geopolitics. Geopolitical writings, 
in the words of one critic, ‘shot up like mushrooms 
after a summer rain’.
The main features of these writings (which they 
shared with a wider German revanchism, later codified in 
Nazism) were a critique of the established ‘World Order’, 
and of the injustices imposed on Germany by the victors. 
German claims were often presented graphically in maps 
Uzbekistan (Megoran and Sharopova 2012). The next 
two sections of this chapter will examine aspects of Nazi, 
Fascist and Cold War geopolitics in greater detail.
20.6 Nazi and Fascist geopolitics
The formal tradition of writing about space and power 
under the title of ‘geopolitics’ also found fertile contexts 
in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Japan. Influenced and sup-
ported by Nazi Germany, all these countries (together 
with Hungary and Romania) saw the rise and victory of 
ultra-nationalist or Fascist governments (often through 
violent struggle or full-scale civil war with democratic 
or communist forces) (see Chapter 3). In each case geo-
political debates were crucially negotiated through other 
cultural and political debates about race, nationalism, 
the colonial pasts and futures, supposed national ‘mis-
sions’ and destinies and the European and global politi-
cal contexts. In Portugal, for example, the right-wing 
dictatorship argued that it was bringing Christianity and 
civilization to the territories it had acquired in Africa and 
Asia, even projecting these onto a map of Europe to show 
that – if the African territories controlled by Portugal 
were taken into account (Figure 20.4), then Portugal was 
not a small country (Sidaway and Power 2005)! In similar 
Figure 20.4  Portugal is not a small country. Henrique Galvão, 1934.

that were widely circulated (see Herb 1989: 97). Like the 
variants of the geopolitical tradition that were developed 
amongst right-wing and military circles in Italy, Portu-
gal, Spain and Japan, German geopolitics also asserted 
an imperial destiny. Indeed, as Agnew and Corbridge 
(1995: 58–9) explain: ‘The Nazi geopoliticians of the 
1930s came up with formalized schemes for combining 
imperial and colonized peoples within what they called 
“Pan-Regions”.’
In this vision, notions of racial hierarchy were blended 
with conceptions of state ‘vitality’ to justify territorial 
expansion of the Axis powers (see O’Loughlin and van 
der Wusten 1990) (Figure 20.6). In Europe, related con-
ceptions of the need for an expanded German living-
space were used as justification for the mass murder 
of occupied peoples and those who did not fit into the 
grotesque plans of ‘racial/territorial’ purity. The practi-
cal expression of these was the construction of a system 
of racial ‘purification’ and mass extermination. At least 
6 million Jewish people were murdered in concentration 
camps together with millions of others: disabled people, 
gays and lesbians, gypsies and political opponents. His-
torical debates about the role and relative significance 
of German geopolitics within the Holocaust and within 
broader Nazi ideology and strategy continue (see Heske 
1986: 87; Bassin 1987; Ó Tuathail 1996a; Natter 2003). 
Paul Gilroy (2000: 39), however, reiterates the connec-
tions between racial, early ecological and geopolitical 
thinking:
connected in profound ways to the notions of Leben-
sraum (living-space) that figured in but were not cre-
ated by the racist population policies and agricultural 
and scientific planning of the Nazi period . . . [and 
to] the geo-organic, biopolitical and governmental 
theories of the German geographers Friedrich Ratzel 
and Karl Haushofer and the early-twentieth century 
geopolitican Rudolf Kjellén. These writers supplied 
important conceptual resources to Nazi racial science, 
helping it to conceptualize the state as an organism 
and to specify the necessary connections between the 
nation and its dwelling area.
In the United States in the 1940s, German geopolitics 
became the subject of lurid tales and depictions, cropping 
up in media, military and government ‘explanations’ of 
Nazi danger. Popular magazines, such as Readers Digest, 
would inform Americans of the ‘scientists behind Hit-
ler’ describing German geopolitics as the key to Nazi 

Chapter 20  Geopolitical traditions    409
once the minority Jewish and Gypsy populations there 
had been murdered and the majority Slavic population 
enslaved (see Rössler 1989 and Barnes and Minca 2013).
The defeat of the Axis powers in 1945 (culminating in 
the use of American atomic weapons against the civilian 
populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan) and 
the lurid wartime depictions of Nazi geopolitics in the 
United States dealt something of a blow to the formal 
tradition of geopolitics. In the 1990s, however, right-
wing geopolitics returned – in Russia and Ukraine for 
example, where references to Nazi-era concepts (such as 
Grobraum, ‘larger space’) and associated racist and anti-
Semitic ideologies have become influential within some 
contemporary geopolitical thought (Ingram 2001; Wilson 
2002; O’Loughlin et al. 2005). Moreover, references to 
geopolitics had continued through the 1950s to the 1970s 
in both Spain and Portugal (see Sidaway 1999, 2000; Sida-
way and Power 2005), where Fascist regimes remained in 
power to the mid-1970s, as well as in Turkey (especially 
when it too was under military rule through part of the 
1960s, and again in the early 1970s and early 1980s). On 
the Turkish example, Pinar Bilgin (2007: 753) argues that:
Constructed through texts authored by military 
geopoliticians, and disseminated through a variety 
strategy. And whilst the relative significance of the Ger-
man geopolitical tradition in the wider genocidal ultra-
nationalism of German Fascism was certainly overstated 
in such accounts, we should see geopolitics as a particular 
expression of wider academic and intellectual involve-
ment and complicity in authoritarian state power, war-
making and genocide. Much more widely, beyond the 
geopolitical tradition per se, academic geography was 
deeply implicated in these activities. Exploring this, Nat-
ter (2003: 188) notes how
[T]he work of disciplinary historians of geography 
has demonstrated the extent to which the demarca-
tion of geography seems inseparable from the history 
of war, imperialism and quests for national iden-
tity. . . . Geopolitics, thus, would mark a particular, 
but in no way separable (and hence containable) geo-
political deployment of geo-power.
An example of this wider complicity was the way in 
which the models of ‘Central Place Theory’ (an abstract 
model of the ideal spatial distribution of towns), which 
were developed in Germany by Walter Christaller in 
the 1930s, were elaborated with the express purpose of 
providing planners with a model of German settlement 
to impose on conquered territories of Eastern Europe,

20.7 Cold War geopolitics and the 
­logics of containment
The Cold War is used as a shorthand description of 
the conflict (which to many seemed to be a conflict for 
world domination) between the ‘communist’ East, led 
by the USSR, and the ‘capitalist’ West, led by the USA 
from around 1949 to around 1989. This was not simply 
a rift between two great powers, but a complex ideologi-
cal conflict, which often appeared to be about different 
ways of life and contrasting social systems (the bureau-
cratic ‘command economies’ based on predominantly 
state ownership of the means of production, with a rul-
ing class drawn from the bureaucracy; and the capitalist 
economies based on predominantly private ownership, 
with a ruling class drawn from a bureaucracy controlled 
by the owners of capital). It was also a conflict in which 
direct military confrontation between the two great pow-
ers was avoided. Hence the metaphor of Cold, that is, 
‘poor, frozen or frosty’ relationships, but short of all-out 
‘hot’ war, involving direct exchanges of missiles, bombs 
and so on. In part this avoidance of direct conflict arose 
because both powers were conscious of the enormous 
stakes, armed with nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons as well as vast arsenals of increasingly high-
tech ‘conventional’ armaments. By the 1960s, they were 
each capable of destroying virtually all human life sev-
eral times over. Moreover, neither could attack the other 
without being sure that the enemy would not still pos-
sess enough undamaged nuclear weapons to retaliate, 
a ‘balance’ of terror known, appropriately enough, as 
MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction). Instead, conflict 
took the form of the continual preparation for war (as 
in ‘civil defense’ preparations, see Plate 20.3) plus proxy 
wars in what became known as the (originally not pro-
West, not pro-East, but contested) ‘Third World’ and 
many other political, economic and cultural forms of 
competition. That is, it was a conflict conducted by every 
means except direct military confrontation between the 
superpowers.
Of course there was no shortage of indirect confron-
tation and preparation for war. Europe was divided into 
two armed camps and split down the middle between 
Soviet and American zones of influence by a fortified 
military and ideological frontier that became known as 
the ‘Iron Curtain’. Whilst Europe was characterized by 
an uneasy stability and balance of terror, by the 1970s 
the term ‘geopolitics’ had been revived (or rediscovered) 
by US national security advisers Henry Kissinger and 
Zbigniew Brzezinski (see Hepple 1986; Sidaway 1998) 
to refer to the strategic vision deemed necessary to 
of institutions including compulsory military ser-
vice (with access to all males 18+ years of age), the 
National Security Academy (proving in service train-
ing to high level civil servants and journalists), and the 
compulsory high-school course ‘National Security’, 
Turkey’s geopolitical discourse has allowed the mili-
tary to play a central role in shaping domestic political 
processes but also make this role seem ‘normal’.
In addition, as this chapter has detailed, geopolitics 
has been influential in recent decades in a number of 
South American countries, especially in the 1970s’ and 
early 1980s’ epoch of military rule through much of the 
continent. These regimes (and plenty of others) were 
integrated into the US-led anti-communist network of 
allies. In a policy that became known as containment, 
the USA aimed to encircle and block the potential expan-
sion of Soviet power and influence beyond the immediate 
borders of the USSR and the pro-Soviet states installed by 
the USSR in the Eastern European territories that it had 
occupied during its Second World War battle for survival 
against Nazi Germany. In the allied countries (and as an 
expression of this strategy of containment), the functions 
of geopolitics, in particular its ‘strategic vision’ and claim 
of ‘scientific’ objectivity, continued to operate or were 
displaced into other disciplines and branches of knowl-
edge, including geography and the expanding subject of 
International Relations. This displacement of strategic 
knowledge was particularly evident in the United States, 
which by 1945 was the greatest power that the world had 
ever seen, constituting over half of the world economy 
and (until the recovery of the Soviet Union and its own 
development of atomic weapons in 1949) possessing a 
virtually unrivalled military capacity.

China remained a force to be reckoned with and opposed 
American support for Taiwan. Thousands of American 
troops stationed in South Korea were just a short dis-
tance from a hostile communist North Korea. By the 
early 1980s, American concern about the security of oil 
supplies from the Persian Gulf region had escalated to 
the extent that the then US President Carter declared that 
it was of vital importance to the USA (see Spotlight box 
20.1). In this world of superpower competition, geopoli-
tics again found its moment and expression in the visions 
of the national security advisers and American generals.
More widely, American leaders and policy makers 
declared that the Soviet Union had to be encircled and 
contained. The metaphor of disease (containment) was 
mixed with that of ‘dominoes’ – if one country (say Viet-
nam or Cuba) had ‘fallen’ to Soviet control or influence, 
then it could (like a chain reaction) ‘infect’ other proxi-
mate ones. The irony of this (which is equally present 
in the formal geopolitical tradition) is that in the name 
of security and strategy, the real complexity of human 
geographies in the places (such as Vietnam or Chile, or 
Afghanistan, Nicaragua or the Persian Gulf) that are 
deemed strategic is sometimes obscured or erased. Forget 
about the complex details of the people, culture and soci-
ety. What matters is the ‘strategic value’ of the place, or 
the political identity of its government as an ideological 
and strategic friend or foe. At times this could take quite 
extreme forms, as with US National Security Advisor 
Robert McNamara (previously head of Ford, and later 
head of the World Bank):
circumvent the sense of growing Soviet power, particu-
larly in the Third World, where a wave of successful revo-
lutions had brought left-wing, pro-Soviet governments 
to power. One of these was in Cuba, but by the end of 
the 1970s, there were also pro-Soviet governments in the 
countries of Indochina (Vietnam, Laos and Kampuchea) 
where the United States had been unable to defeat com-
munist insurgencies despite a massive military effort, in 
the African countries of Angola and Mozambique, in 
the Arabian country of South Yemen and in Afghanistan 
as well as in the small Central American state of Nica-
ragua. Although China had moved away from its close 
alliance with the Soviets by the early 1960s, communist

The Carter Doctrine: contexts and 
consequences
In late 1979, the USSR invaded Afghanistan. For the 
Soviets, this meant supporting a communist govern-
ment in a neighbouring country, who had come to power 
just a couple of years before (in a coup, after several 
years of political instability) and were facing rebellion 
and resistance in the Afghan countryside (already being 
fostered by the Pakistani and US intelligence agencies). 
For strategists in Moscow, the invasion would secure 
the USSR’s southern flank, especially from the grow-
ing perceived threats from a new Islamic radicalism: the 
USSR had millions of Muslim citizens in its Central Asian 
territories, and feared that the Islamic revolution in Iran 
and the insurgency in Afghanistan might influence them 
and threaten Soviet power and stability. However, for 
the USA – at least to those in influential positions, like 
US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski – this 
marked a new phase of Soviet expansion and a failure 
of containment. In tandem with the Islamic revolution in 
Iran which overthrew the Shah (who was an American 
ally and whose rise to power in the 1950s was orches-
trated by the USA and Britain) was the second jump in oil 
prices in a decade, and American concern over the secu-
rity of oil supplies from the Persian Gulf region grew. 
Brzezinski and the American media had already starting 
talking about the region as ‘an arc [or crescent] of crisis’ 
(see Sidaway 1998) (see Plate 20.5, which shows how 
the influential Time magazine represented these ‘geo-
political dangers’). And soon after the Soviets invaded 
Afghanistan the US media started to describe it as the 
first Soviet step towards the Middle East, and President 
Carter announced that any threat by an outside force to 
the Persian Gulf was a matter of direct American stra-
tegic interest and would result in a military response. 
This commitment became known as the Carter Doctrine, 
taking its place amongst a succession of other US Presi-
dential geopolitical doctrines: such as Truman in 1947, 
who set out the overall commitment to containment, to 
(after Carter) the Reagan Doctrine in the 1980s (which 
sought to roll back Soviet influence in places like Afghan-
istan and elsewhere in the Third World where pro-Soviet 
regimes had come to power, rather than simply contain 
the USSR and its allies). Under the Reagan Doctrine, 
vast quantities of weapons were channelled to rebel 
forces fighting the pro-Soviet government in Afghanistan. 
Amongst those who took part in the anti-Soviet struggle 
in Afghanistan and through which the armaments were 
channelled was Osama Bin Laden – later to turn against 
the United States, whom he came to regard as intent on 
dominating the Muslim world (Coll 2004).

Robert McNamara was, of course, the leading speci-
men of homo mathematicus – i.e., men who behave 
and believe other men [and, we might suppose, women 
too] behave primarily in response to ‘hard data’, usu-
ally numbers (infiltration rates, ‘kill ratios’, bomb 
tonnage). Like the classic private eye on television, 
they are always looking for ‘the facts’, but usually 
the wrong ones. They miss reality, for they never get 
close enough or related enough to another society 
to do more than count things in it. If you relate to a 
country as a military target you do not need to know 
anything about it except details as are easily supplied 

Chapter 20  Geopolitical traditions    413
modern art in the second half of the twentieth century 
became intertwined with Cold War geopolitics. More 
generally, art and politics have frequently been inter-
twined. The Nazis (and their leader Adolf Hitler, who 
was a failed artist of minimal talents) detested modern 
art, condemning it as decadent. Other dictators, such as 
Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union from the 
mid-1920s till his death in 1953, were also wary of mod-
ern art and favoured a garish realist style, depicting heroic 
smiling workers and peasants. Meanwhile, and especially 
in the years between the two World Wars, Paris became 
the centre of production of modern art. The American 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) stepped in after 1945 
to fund and promote American modern art, bankrolling 
major exhibitions and tours, to demonstrate the creative 
artistic culture of the United States.
Of course, the Cold War was waged too in every-
thing from science fiction comics and action movies and 
thrillers (in which good Americans, like Rambo, and the 
occasional heroic Brit, like James Bond (Plate 20.7), faced 
and defeated totalitarian, alien and frequently commu-
nist enemies) to chess (where ‘Soviet Man’ could demon-
strate intellectual superiority and training) and Olympic 
sports (in which the Soviet, Chinese, East Germans and 
Bulgarians invested enormous resources in training and 
drug-enhanced muscles, to ‘prove’ the superiority of the 
communist system in the Olympic stadiums). Heroic men 
(and sometimes women) were invoked. Each one seeking 
to outdo the other, rather like men on sports fields or in 
street fights might (see Spotlight box 20.2). The ‘Space 
Race’, to build and launch artificial satellites and then to 
put men into space and reach the moon became a military, 
technical and a cultural expression of the Cold War – full 
of moments of national superpower pride, media specta-
cles and the basis of tales of heroic and daring American 
and Soviet men in space (Carter 1988). We might thus 
write of a ‘popular geopolitics’ to designate how geo-
political concepts are reflected in and take on meaning 
through popular culture: from art and literature, through 
film to comics, sport, computer games (Power 2007) or 
the Internet (Dodds 2006) and more traditional media 
like magazines, newspapers, radio and television. Car-
toons and comic books have received ample attention in 
studies of such popular geopolitics – and continued to 
proliferate after the Cold War (Plate 20.8): see the article 
by Dittmer (2005) listed in the further reading for this 
chapter. Even more radically removed from the circles of 
policy makers are the studies that contest the bird’s eye 
views of classical geopolitics and that firmly refocus the 
attention upon the impact of geopolitical policies and 
practices in the everyday life of regular people. Femi-
nist geopolitics have offered the most powerful avenues 
towards such analyses (see Spotlight box 20.2).
by reconnaissance satellites, spy ships, secret agents, 
etcetera. You need never know who the victims of your 
attack were. Your task is merely to assess the results 
of what you have done and this is done by counting 
bodies, destroyed factories, enemy soldiers.
(Barnet 1973: 119)
Such logic is seemingly far removed from the promi-
nence of maps in the formal geopolitical tradition. Yet 
we can see that, in both the kind of thought present in 
McNamara’s mind and in classical geopolitics, there are 
moments when the myriad complexity of the world is 
reduced to a simple black and white representation, be it 
numerical or cartographic.
20.8 Cold War geopolitics in art and 
culture and ‘popular geopolitics’
Few works of art explicitly refer to geopolitics. A famous 
one that does is Geopoliticus Child Watching the Birth 
of the New Man by the Catalan painter Salvador Dalí. It 
was painted in 1943 in New York, during his stay in the 
United States from 1940 to 1948 (Plate 20.6). The paint-
ing is generally read as representing the rising of the USA 
as the new world power during the Second World War. 
The crushing of Europe is seen as a representation of its 
diminishing role in international politics and the oversize 
of Africa and South America as a growing importance 
of the (former and remaining) colonies. More widely, 
however, the art world and, in particular, the course of

Feminist geopolitics
As in other academic fields, feminist scholars brought 
social struggles into academia to question taken-for-
granted assumptions in geopolitical research and, more 
generally, in political geographical scholarship. Bringing 
issues of emancipation and empowerment, and their 
counterparts subordination and oppression, to the fore, 
feminist approaches problematized the state-centric 
approach of geopolitics, its elitism (as it is concerned 
with the visions and the behaviour of those in power), 
and its abstract, disembodied view of politics. They 
question, for example, the definition of security in terms 
of state security, undermine the idea of a national inter-
est that would give clear direction for the conduct of 
foreign policy, and scrutinize by contrast how foreign and 
military policies affect the everyday life of people on the 
agenda. After all, if a state is more secure, does it auto-
matically mean that the people it rules are? And whose 
security? Of ruling elites, or the state? Or security from 
disease, detention or from violence in the home?
Fiona Smith (2001), for example, showed how the 
end of the Communist regime in Eastern Germany and 
German reunification were received with mixed feeling 
by people whose life was highly disrupted by the institu-
tional changes (disorientation, massive unemployment, 
disappearance of many public services, etc). Address-
ing more acute situations, Jennifer Hyndman (2007, 
2010) discusses the politics of body counts in the 
American intervention in Iraq and the fate of child 
soldiers in different geopolitical context. Another line 
of research has been the inquiry into the militariza-
tion of the lives of soldiers and their families, not only 
in wartime but also in military bases, for example as 
epitomized by the pioneering and prolific work of femi-
nist scholar Cynthia Enloe (1983, 1989, 1993, 2000, 
2004, 2007). As such, feminist geopolitics also exam-
ines environmental geographies of militarization (such 
as pollution by weapons in and around the battlefields 
and test sites – see Woodward 2004, 2005). Rachel 
Pain (2009, 2014) has addressed the geopolitics of glo-
balized fear. She questions the hegemonic discourse 
about globalized fear and security that has become 
pervasive in the West and serves to justify the US led 
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the intensification of 
surveillance practices. She foregrounds the uneven 
distribution of the insecurities of everyday life among 
people, and how much less attention and less means 
are devoted to the reduction of everyday insecurity and 
widespread forms of domestic violence that she calls 
‘everyday terrorism’ than to the terrorist attacks that 
remain exceptional.

20.9 New World Order, the Long War, 
Cold Peace and beyond
The notion of the Cold War faded with the collapse of 
the USSR and associated communist allies between 1989 
and the early 1990s, leaving the United States as the sole 
effective global military superpower. Yet this Western 
and American ‘victory’ quickly produced a certain sense 
of disorientation. This had been evident before, as the 
so-called ‘bipolar’ world of the early years of Cold War 
confrontation in which Washington and Moscow were 
the main political, economic and ideological points of 
orientation became progressively more ‘multipolar’ from 
the 1960s onwards. That is, as Western Europe and Japan 
recovered from wartime devastation and as Communist 
China split on ideological grounds with the USSR, the 
sense that the world was divided into just two superpower 
points of orientation lessened. But the sensation of geo-
political complexity was to grow precipitously once one 
of the established ‘poles’ (Soviet communism and pro-
Soviet regimes in Central and Eastern Europe) collapsed 
at the start of the 1990s. Having a clearly demarcated and 
identifiable enemy – as both sides had in the Cold War 
– offered contrasting but apparently solid ideas of iden-
tity, purpose and common cause that has faded in a post-
Cold War world. If the Cold War embodied a relatively 
coherent geopolitical map (East against West, with the 
allegiance of the Third World as one of the prizes), the 
post-Cold War world has been characterized by a diver-
sity of maps and scripts. A variety of interpretations and 
geopolitical ‘models’ now attempt to offer explanation 
and impose meaning on contemporary events.
Amongst the most influential of these was the dis-
course of New World Order, articulated by then US 
President George Bush (senior) in the early 1990s. In 
Bush’s vision, what is called the ‘international commu-
nity’ (the member states of the United Nations, led by the 
USA, but with financial and military support from key 
allies such as Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan) 
would act as a kind of global police force, intervening 
where and when they felt necessary to maintain or restore 
‘order’. Both the 1990–1 Gulf War and the 1999 conflict 
with Yugoslavia were justified and conducted (in part) in 
the name of building such a ‘New World Order’. But it 
was his son, President George W. Bush, who was left to 
articulate a new American strategy (which became the 
Bush Doctrine, of pre-emptive attack on states that may – 
it was claimed – threaten the United States or harbour 
terrorists) in the aftermath of 9/11. And even this was, 
arguably, partially within a long American geopolitical 
tradition of overthrowing overseas regimes during and 
before the Cold War, which has its roots in the rise of 
American power in the Pacific and Americas in the late 
nineteenth century and has some deeper roots in the colo-
nization of the continent (Kinzer 2006). Even well before 
9/11 and the Bush administration’s strategic reactions to 
it, critics had pointed out that, as Booth (1999: 49) put it, 
the New World Order ‘means the New World [gives out 
the] Orders’. That is, the United States was seeking global 
military hegemony and with the Soviet resistance out of 
the way, at first there seemed little, save its own ‘public 
opinion’ (or perhaps, economic limits?) to stop it.
Others stressed that such apparent American mili-
tary superiority and rhetoric counted for less than might 
appear at first sight, and that what continued to be evi-
dent in the post-Cold War world was enhanced economic 
(and in some ways, cultural) competition between blocs 
or great powers. In this vision, American power is poten-
tially contested by Russia and more notably China. But 
the terms of the ‘contest’ not simply in conventional mili-
tary and strategic terms (though these continue) than in 
competition for markets, productivity and profit. A world 
of ‘geopolitical’ competition is, it was argued, being par-
tially displaced by ‘geoeconomic’ competition (for an 
example, see Luttwak 1990). In the USA (and beyond), 
this was also sometimes interpreted as an impending 
‘supposed clash of civilizations’ (e.g. Huntington 1993), 
between that of the ‘West’ and, for example, societies 
oriented to alternative belief systems such as (Chinese) 
‘Confucianism’ or ‘Islam’. Although superficially quite 
different, notions of geoeconomic competition and a 
clash of civilizations both betray a sense that the relative 
military dominance of the USA at the end of the Cold

War may not in itself be enough to preserve America’s 
sense of leadership, power and world-historical destiny 
in the context of a complex ‘multipolar’ world. Cer-
tainly it quickly faced multiple challenges, as attempts 
to implement visions of ‘A New American Century [of 
leadership]’ (www.newamericancentury.org) mutated 
into an open commitment to what the US Department 
of Defense, in the form of National Security Strategy 
documents, called (and codified in the February 2006 
Defense Review as) ‘The Long War’ with the ‘global war 
on terror’ (GWoT) taking the centre stage once occupied 
by communism. However, as Buzan (2006: 1102) argued, 
despite the prominence of the global war on terror in 
these texts, it could not define contemporary US grand 
strategy overall:
US grand strategy is much wider, involving more tra-
ditional concerns about rising powers, global energy 
supply, the spread of military technology and the 
enlargement of the democratic/capitalist sphere. US 
military expenditure remains largely aimed at meet-
ing traditional challenges from other states, with 
only a small part specifically allocated for the GWoT. 
The significance of the GWoT is much more politi-
cal . . . the main significance of the GWoT is as a 
political framing that might justify and legitimize US 
primacy, leadership and unilateralism, both to Ameri-
cans and to the rest of the world.
A few years later, Clark (2011: 20) noted how:
President Obama’s 2010 National Security Strat-
egy . . . described ‘a dynamic international environ-
ment in which different nations are exerting greater 
influence’ and ‘emerging powers in every region of the 
world are increasingly asserting themselves’. . . . Offi-
cial US projections up to 2025 paint a broadly similar 
picture. These highlight the trend towards multipo-
larity, associated with a greater diffusion of power 
internationally.
Meanwhile, as Sakwa (2015b: 565) describes: ‘An 
extended period of “cold peace” settled over relations 
between Russia and the West, although punctuated by 
attempts by both sides to escape the logic of renewed 
confrontation’. By the mid-2010s, this cold peace was 
starting to look more like a reproduction of Cold War 
practices (Sakwa calls this ‘mimetic Cold War’) but with-
out the deep ideological divide. This, plus fears about 
cybersecurity, geoeconomic shifts, the assassinations 
of Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders, the conflict 
between Russia and Ukraine in the east of the latter, the 
2011 war in Libya, and the ensuing wars between fac-
tions in that country and in post-revolutionary Egypt, 
the establishment of the Islamic State in Iraq and the 
Levant, its ethnic-confessional cleansing policies and the 
succeeding wars in Northern Iraq and in Syria, have been 
at the fore of renewed debate about geopolitics in the 
United States and elsewhere. Who would have predicted 
these two or three decades ago? And what forms will such 
debates take in 20–30 years’ time?
20.10 Conclusions: shifting 
hegemonies?
Despite early post-Cold War proclamations about the 
great prospects for a more peaceful and secure New World 
Order, the world soon came to appear to American strate-
gists (and many others) as more ‘disordered’ and unpre-
dictable. So on one level, the apparent simplicity of the 
great power and Cold War confrontations, let alone demar-
cated and fixed ‘heartlands’, have been replaced by the 
sense of a world of proliferating uncertainty and threats. 
Indeed, the scares, anxieties and insecurities that revolve 
around (non-state) terrorism activities in different parts of 
the world have greatly reinforced this – from the loose and 
amorphous terrorist networks of Al-Qaeda to the transna-
tional threats posed by Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq.
But this is not to suggest that traditional state-centred 
powers have fallen under the global geopolitical radar. 
Contrary to that, there have been widespread debates 
(especially in the ‘West’) that the remaining superpower 
(i.e. the USA) will have to contend with the challenges 
presented by emerging players on the geopolitical scene. 
Notwithstanding notions of the European Union (EU) 
as a distinctive geopolitical actor (Bachmann and Sida-
way 2009; see also Spotlight box 20.3) it is, however, the 
concern over whether China is set to replace America as 
the next global hegemon that have garnered widespread 
attention (see Mearsheimer 2010; Luttwak 2012). Indeed, 
given the proliferating discourses pertaining to China ‘on 
the rise’, it is worth reflecting deeper on the geopolitical 
logic underpinning such claims and the associated reac-
tions within China.
That China is often viewed through the lens of ascend-
ancy is hardly surprising: there is an impressive list of 
economic growth credentials, not to mention its sheer 
advantage of size in both area and population. But more 
crucially, the series of assertive actions that have char-
acterized Chinese foreign policy since 2008 – including 
China’s extensive territorial claims in the South China 
Sea (see Chapter 24 on global governance) as well as its 
new doctrine of defending ‘core interests’ (
) 
in Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet – have come to serve 
as testaments of a China that is intent on extending 
and consolidating its growing geopolitical influence (Li 

Chapter 20  Geopolitical traditions    417
2010; Swaine 2010). However, China has been quick to 
dismiss such actions as emblematic of its irredentist and 
expansionist geopolitical ambitions. Chinese leaders have 
constantly maintained that its contemporary geopolitical 
engagements are in line with its purported idea/strategy 
of ‘peaceful rise’ (
) and its so-called ‘aggressive 
behaviors’ are no more than justified acts (as per global 
norms) to preserve its ‘territorial integrity’ (
). 
According to Hughes (2011), such a reasoning constitutes 
the Chinese state’s ‘pragmatic nationalism’ which care-
fully traverses the duality of conveying China’s status as 
a responsible global actor whilst simultaneously attempt-
ing to fuel a recognition and respect of the nation’s sover-
eign space. The latter is achieved through a ‘cartography 
of national humiliation’ (Callahan 2010) whereby his-
toric and contemporary instances of humiliation (
) 
at the hands of foreign powers are routinely invoked by 
Chinese elites through maps (see Figure 20.7) to shape 
and defend imaginative geographies of China’s geobody 
(Wang 2012).
But as Hughes goes on to caution, this seemingly prag-
matic approach adopted by China can be easily exploited 
by variants of what he calls ‘geopolitik nationalism’ that 
currently infuse popular Chinese political writings (see 
also Lei 2005). As opposed to a defensive strategy, these 
works hinge on a geopolitik view of international rela-
tions as the struggle for survival to exhort for strong lead-
ers and a militaristic China. For instance, Wolf Totem 
(
) describes China as an entity with a personality 
that can only function properly if it strikes the right bal-
ance between the ‘sheepish qualities’ of the Han and the 
‘wolfish traits’ of the northerners, with the latter being 
Figure 20.7  One of the maps documenting China’s Century of National Humiliation. The shaded areas on the 
map represent the loss of China’s territory between 1895-1945 as a result of Japanese invasion.

‘somewhat greater’ (Jiang 2004: 375). The strategic impli-
cations for China then, is to become a ‘sea wolf’, emulating 
models such as Genghis Khan and the Japanese pirates of 
old, so as to satisfy its need for lebensraum (
). The 
need for China to defend its living space is also addressed  
in Zhang Wenmu’s (2009) China’s Maritime Rights 
(
). Zhang (ibid: 109) looks to Alfred Mahan’s 
ideas about sea power to develop a ‘naval theory with spe-
cial Chinese characteristics’ in order to uphold China’s 
interests which are threatened by a combination of EU trade 
barriers and a US Navy that can block access to imports, 
as the world’s hegemon sucks up the world’s resources 
like a giant leech. It is interesting to note that a sense of 
moral exceptionalism pervades these Chinese texts, which 
is reminiscent of arguments used by 1930s and 1940s Ger-
man geopolitik thinkers to claim that their own country’s 
expansion is aimed at restoring equilibrium in an unjust 
international order. Thus, China’s ‘rise’, as many of these 
Chinese scholars argue, will be different because it is built 
on a ‘humane power’ (
) rather than the ‘hegemonic 
Spotlight box 20.3
The EU as a geopolitical actor
The European Union (EU) incrementally developed a 
new type of geopolitical role. At the beginning of the 
1950s, France and West Germany aimed at constructing 
new collaborative institutions between Western Euro-
pean states in an effort to prevent a fourth major con-
flict between themselves after the French Prussian war 
of 1870–1, the Great War of 1914–18 and the Second 
World War of 1939–45; these collaborative institutions 
later evolved into the European Union.
The first effort to collaborate more formally was the 
establishment in 1952 of the European Coal and Steel 
Community (ECSC) by six member states: France, West 
Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Nether-
lands. This was a limited and technical form of integra-
tion, but economically and militarily crucial. Coal was 
still the major source of energy then and steel was key 
to manufacturing and weapons industry. The geopolitical 
idea behind the proposal of the French Minister of For-
eign Affairs Robert Schumann was articulated by high-
ranked civil servant Jean Monnet who had worked during 
the world wars and in the postwar reconstruction at col-
laborative efforts between the allies to improve their war 
and reconstruction logistics. The idea of a technical and 
technocratic approach was successful and the role of 
the Community has spilled over to many other economic 
and social activities and enlarged to include 28 member 
states: including many former communist states that had 
been precluded from joining during the Cold War.
The EU remains, however, an extraordinary geopolitical 
actor as it does not have its own army and it has to 
coordinate its diplomatic services, the European External 
Action Service (EEAS) and its foreign policies with that 
of its member states.
The content of its geopolitical representations is 
worth underlining. The EU is primarily conceived as a 
civilian power: its weight in regional and global politics 
is derived from its economic, political and cultural influ-
ences, not from its military power (Bachmann and Sida-
way 2009). As the largest single market and the largest 
economy in the world (if the economy of the 28 mem-
ber states is taken as one), with a large regulatory and 
normative power, it greatly influenced a wide array of 
countries with strong ties with it, economic or otherwise.
The civilian power of the EU is projected particularly 
strongly in the so-called European neighbourhood, the 
countries bordering the EU, some of them applicants 
to become EU members at some point, like the Balkan 
countries and Turkey, with others encouraged to become 
‘good’ neighbours’ like North Africa, Ukraine and the 
Caucasus. These policies more than once reveal the 
contradictions between the EU’s principles and its 
actions, for example when it implements a restrictive 
migration policy and externalizes the control of its exter-
nal border to neighbouring countries who do not respect 
human rights, let alone the rights of asylum seekers and 
migrants in transit (see for example Bialasiewicz 2012 
for the relation with Gaddafi’s Libya).
Although the ENP policy is conceived as benevolent 
in Brussels, it is perceived as threatening in Moscow, 
and it has proven particularly divisive in Ukraine where 
a conflict about signing the Association Agreement with 
the EU was the catalyst of massive protests that evolved 
into a civil war and the disintegration of the state, with 
the Russian annexation of the Crimea and an ongoing 
war in the Donbas(s), including the shooting-down of a 
commercial airliner – flight MH17 from Amsterdam to 
Kuala Lumpur – on 17 July 2014 above Eastern Ukraine. 
The confrontation between Russia and the EU (and the 
USA) has brought about a revival of geopolitical narra-
tives both from the Cold War period and from the 1930s 
and the disastrous appeasement policies towards Hitler’s 
ambitions (Sakwa 2015b).

way’ (
) of the ‘West’. Moreover, as Agnew (2010a), 
Reid and Zheng (2008) and Zeng et al. (2015) have rightly 
pointed out, China, as with any other country in the world, 
does not operate in a vacuum and has to negotiate its rela-
tions with other states, international organizations and all 
manner of private actors. There is no easy or predictable 
end to this uncertain situation and new challenges – climate 
change – complicate the global scene. New and old chal-
lenges and shifting patterns and forms of power, resistance 
and domination are expressed in space and time.
Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter, you should understand:
● That the term ‘geopolitics’ has been associated with 
a wide variety of texts and contexts.
● However, geopolitics is frequently associated with 
the sense of a self-conscious tradition of writing 
about and mapping the relations between states, 
geography and power.
● This is usually traced to the early twentieth-century 
writings of Rudolf Kjellén and Halford Mackinder.
● One of the key features of this tradition is the idea 
that the state resembles a living organism which 
requires living space and will compete with others 
(the organic theory of the state).
● The oppressive military regimes in South America 
(notably Argentina, Brazil and Chile) during the 
1960s and 1970s elaborated and applied a variety 
of the geopolitical tradition.
● However, it also proliferated in a number of 
­European countries and Japan, particularly 
between the two world wars.
● The rise and eclipse of the Cold War have pro-
duced wide and deep geopolitical transformations.
● Since this proliferation of geopolitics was most evi-
dent in Fascist states, the defeat of the Axis pow-
ers in 1945 signified its relative decline as a formal 
tradition, although it continued in Fascist Spain and 
Portugal and in South American military circles.
● Beyond the self-conscious tradition of geopolitics, 
similar forms of thinking about territory, states and 
power have proliferated in many disciplines and 
countries. Indeed, we can also think of ‘popular 
geopolitics’ – whereby everyday culture (such as 
cinema) contains and expresses wider geopolitical 
narratives.
● This has been particularly evident during the Cold 
War, when broader geopolitical discourses suffused 
many aspects of art, science, culture and daily life.
● Since the decline of the Cold War, there was a pro-
liferation of geopolitical visions of the ‘New World 
Order’, amongst them a more complex cartography 
of perceptions of threats and dangers. However, 
the ability of any new single geopolitical ‘big picture’ 
(such as ‘the war on terror’) to inherit the mantle of 
the Cold War was limited.
● There is a flourishing debate about the geopo-
litical impacts of rising Chinese power, Western 
responses and the geopolitical dynamics and con-
sequences of other conflicts, latterly in Eastern 
Ukraine, Iraq and Syria.

21.1 Territory and territoriality
We live in a world where we are regularly confronted with 
signs reminding us of where we can or cannot go, and 
how to behave when we are there. We may be barred, 
admonished, instructed or warned through signs telling 
us ‘keep out’, ‘authorized personnel only’, ‘no trespass-
ing’, ‘keep off the grass’ and so on. These are everyday 
reminders of how control of space facilitates various 
forms of social control (Plate 21.1). The global politi-
cal map provides us with the most obvious formalized 
manifestation of this territorialized mode of thinking. 
However, this macro-scale territorialization is accompa-
nied by a myriad of much more micro-scale, often less 
formal, variants. In everyday usage, territory is usually 
taken to refer to a portion of geographic space which is 
claimed or occupied by a person, a group or an institu-
tion. In this way it can be seen as an area of bounded 
space. Following from this, the ways in which individuals 
or groups lay claim to such territory can be referred to 
as ‘territoriality’. Territories and territorial strategies are 
bound up with attempts by individuals or groups to wield 
power, or to resist power imposed on them. However, as 
will be seen, these somewhat simplified definitions mask 
considerable complexity.
It is sometimes assumed that humans have a natural 
tendency to behave in a territorial manner: to claim space 
and to prevent others from encroaching on ‘our’ terri-
tory. Considerable debate has occurred over the extent to 
which territorialization and territorial behaviour should 
be seen as a ‘natural’ or ‘social’ phenomenon, a debate 
echoing wider long-standing arguments over the relative 
influence of nature and nurture, a division that many see 
as somewhat blurred (see Whatmore 2014). In his land-
mark book Human Territoriality: Its Theory and History, 
published in 1986, Robert Sack cautions against deter-
minist views of human territoriality as a basic instinct 
and emphasizes instead its role as a geographic and 
political strategy. For Sack, territoriality is ‘the attempt 
by an individual or group to affect, influence, or control 
people, phenomena, and relationships, by delimiting and 
asserting control over a geographic area’ (Sack 1986: 19). 
He draws attention to the means through which territo-
rial strategies may be used to achieve particular ends. In 
essence the control of geographic space can be used to 
assert or to maintain power, or, importantly, to resist the 
power of a dominant group:
Territoriality, as a component of power, is not only 
a means of creating and maintaining order, but is a 
device to create and maintain much of the geographic 
context through which we experience the world and 
give it meaning.
(Sack 1986: 219)
In this way territoriality is deeply embedded in social 
relations and territories, rather than being natural enti-
ties, result from social practices and processes and are 
produced under particular conditions and serve specific 
ends (Delaney 2005). Sack (1986) argues that territoriality 
involves a classification by area whereby geographic space 
is apportioned. However, territories are more than mere 
spatial containers; they link space and society conveying 
clear meanings relating to authority, power and rights 
(Sassen 2006; Delaney 2009). David Delaney has defined 
a territory as ‘a bounded social space that inscribes a cer-
tain social meaning onto defined segments of the mate-
rial world’ (2005: 14). These geographic spaces convey 
messages of political power and control which are com-
municated through various means, most notably through 
the creation and maintenance of boundaries that divide 
those ‘inside’ from those ‘outside’; separating ‘us’ from 
‘them’. Space is controlled and territory facilitates clas-
sification, communication, enforcement and exclusion 
through boundary-making. This may have important 
implications, through constraining, restricting or limit-
ing mobility, for example.
While Sack’s work focused usefully on territoriality as 
a political strategy, more recently Stuart Elden has drawn 
attention to the concept of territory itself. He argues that 
debates on territoriality have tended to take the idea of 
territory for granted so that they ‘conceptually presup-
pose the object that they practically produce’ (2010: 803). 
In The Birth of Territory (2013) and in other writings, 
Elden suggests that the concept is bound up with particu-
lar ways of thinking about geographic space; ways which 
reflect notions of power and control. He persuasively 
argues that territory is contingent and the relationships

useful political functions. Territoriality and the produc-
tion of territories can be seen as devices that tend to reify 
power so that it appears to reside in the territory itself 
rather than in those who control it. Attention is thereby 
deflected away from the power relationships, ideologies 
and processes underpinning the maintenance of territo-
ries and their boundaries. In this way, as Delaney argues, 
‘territory does much of our thinking for us and closes off 
or obscures questions of power and meaning, ideology 
and legitimacy, authority and obligation’ (2005: 18). Once 
created, territories can become the spatial containers in 
which people are socialized through various social prac-
tices and discourses so that territoriality can be seen as 
‘a primary geographic expression of social power’ (Sack 
1986: 5). As Paasi (2003) suggests, a number of important 
dimensions of social life and social power are brought 
together in territory. There is a material component such 
as land, a functional element associated with control of, 
or attempts to control, space, and a symbolic compo-
nent associated with people’s social identity. The spatial 
is not simply the outcome of the social but the two are 
intrinsically bound up together (Delaney 2009). Painter 
(2010) argues that territory is an effect or an outcome 
of a set of practices and networks of inter-connections. 
Such things as the collection and production of regional 
statistics and the devising of regional economic strate-
gies, reproduces a sense of delimitation, contiguity and 
coherence to the idea of regional divisions. The social, 
cultural and political are brought together so that people 
identify with territories in such a way that they can be 
seen ‘to satisfy both the material requirements of life and 
the emotional requirements of belonging’ (Penrose 2002: 
282). Notwithstanding the evolution of a more globally 
interconnected world, territory continues to retain both 
an allure in terms of identity as well as a strategic value 
(Agnew 2010b; Murphy 2013). This is reflected in a vari-
ety of ways such as preferential claims to jobs on the basis 
of nationality (Ince et al. 2015).
The creation and imagining of territories and the 
utilization of territorial strategies can be observed at 
a variety of spatial scales. The most obvious (and regu-
larly contested) expressions of territoriality are man-
ifested at the level of the state, currently the world’s 
dominant form of political organization (see Chapter 
22). Political maps of the world display this territorial 
configuration of bordered spaces in a way that leads 
us to view it as ‘natural’ and this impression of solid-
ity engenders a very state-centred view of the world in 
which territory is viewed as a mere canvas on which 
political processes play out (Kadercan 2015). However, 
the state system is a political and geographic construct 
that displays considerable dynamism. In recent decades 
the number of states has risen dramatically, consequent 
between people, place and land have been understood dif-
ferently in different historical and geographic contexts 
so that our ways of thinking about geographic space are 
more historically and temporally specific than we might 
otherwise imagine. Within this, Elden argues that our 
contemporary ideas of territory emerged alongside devel-
opments in cartography and spatial calculation. Territo-
ries are more than simply land; instead territory can be 
viewed as what Elden calls a ‘political technology’, related 
to the measurement of land and the control of terrain. 
Territory can be seen as something calculable, mappable 
and controllable. As such, it is suggested that both ter-
ritories themselves and their boundaries (concepts which 
we tend to take for granted) reflect a distinctive mode 
of social and spatial organization which is dependent on 
particular ways of thinking about space. The Swiss geog-
rapher Claude Raffestin (2012) views territoriality as a 
process produced by the various relationships between 
individuals and groups and their wider social environ-
ment. While he emphasizes the meanings of space for 
individuals rather than the functional attainment of par-
ticular goals, the ways in which spatial practices become 
solidified allows for the utilization of territory in stra-
tegic ways (Murphy 2012). The features of territoriality 
identified by Sack (1986), in allowing classification and 
differentiation, are thus a product of the way in which 
space is imagined and territories are in effect politicized 
space; mapped and claimed, ordered and bordered, meas-
ured and demarcated.
If territories reflect a particular way of thinking about 
space, then this points to the importance of maps in 
solidifying and legitimizing these spatial units. Rather 
than neutral depictions of supposed geographical reali-
ties, a more critical analysis suggests that maps have 
always been useful weapons in larger political projects 
associated with territorial claims, and counter-claims 
(Harley 1988; Black 1998; Crampton 2014). Mapping of 
territory itself functions so as to enhance power send-
ing out messages signifying control over portions of geo-
graphic space. Maps of the British Empire conventionally 
depicted Britain’s overseas territorial possessions in pink, 
conveying information while simultaneously proclaiming 
power over roughly one quarter of the planet’s land area. 
Advances in cartography altered the ways in which space 
was considered and led to attempts to apportion and 
control it. The military and political underpinnings of 
cartographic developments and the consequent role of 
mapping (in both practical and symbolic terms) in the 
creation of colonial territory was a key element in the 
imposition and maintenance of political control (Smyth 
2006; Hewitt 2010).
While being mindful of the complexity of ideas sur-
rounding territory and territoriality, it is clear they serve 

424    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
products. Rather than seeing identities as rigidly defined, 
it is more useful and realistic to regard them as unstable, 
relational and contingent. Consequently the chapter is 
concerned with raising questions about who is ‘allowed’ 
to be in particular spaces and who is barred or discour-
aged from being there. In doing so, it sheds light on the 
ways in which space is conceived, used and organized, 
and highlights the idea that identity is both a social and 
spatial phenomenon. The chapter also highlights the use 
of territorial strategies in both managing and policing 
specific issues, and also in resisting particular forms of 
domination.
21.2 Territoriality, race and class
21.2.1 Class and territorial segregation
Societies are seen to be marked by clear inequalities: 
between rich and poor; between property owners and 
those who are not; between those who own and con-
trol resources; and between those who are paid work-
ers or are unable to obtain a job. These social divisions 
(together with race, ethnicity, gender and others) not only 
reflect inequality, they are also deeply spatialized. What 
have been termed social enclaves emerge and these are 
frequently manifested spatially. For example, most cit-
ies appear to have distinct residential neighbourhoods, 
colloquially defined as ‘rich’ or ‘poor’, ‘working class’ 
or ‘middle class’. These spatial divisions are reflected in 
ideas that some people come from ‘the wrong side of 
the tracks’ and everyday discourses of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ 
areas within cities. These latter zones are often viewed 
as separate spaces inhabited by many people who are 
marginalized not just in social and economic terms, but 
also spatially. Moreover, discourses of securitization, 
operationalized through the deployment of various tech-
nologies, often leaves many people relatively immobile 
and spatially confined, reflecting what sociologist Bryan 
Turner (2007) has referred to as an ‘enclave society’. Parts 
of cities may become synonymous with high unemploy-
ment, crime and related negative images. Their residents 
suffer discrimination and inequality, while being sub-
jected to negative stereotyping and often harsh policing. 
Such areas may come to be characterized as dangerous 
neighbourhoods inhabited by people pathologized as an 
underclass. These feelings of alienation and animosity 
fuel an intense stigmatization of both residents and the 
places in which they reside. The stigmatization of place 
tends to be self-reproducing, serving to further reinforce 
class and ethnic divides.
Forms of segregation arise and are reinforced 
through various mechanisms, particularly the housing 
on state collapse (many associated with the fall of 
communism) and secessionist nationalism. Clearly, 
secessionist ideologies (Basque, Kurdish or Scottish 
nationalism for example) are premised on the construc-
tion of a territory, politically detached from the state(s) 
to which it currently belongs. Elsewhere, groups such as 
‘Islamic State’ (in Iraq and Syria) and Boko Haram (in 
Nigeria) are utilizing the control of space in the pursuit 
of ideological objectives. The emergence of quasi-states 
such as South Ossetia (officially part of Georgia) and 
Transnistria (formally belonging to Moldova) reflect a 
means of territorial construction through opting out of 
larger spatial-political entities (Blakkisrud and Kolstø 
2011; O’Loughlin et al. 2011). Ultimately territorial sov-
ereignty is relative, contingent and never complete. It is 
useful to think in terms of effective sovereignty wielded 
by both states and quasi-state actors and deployed 
across a range of territorial contexts where sovereign 
power does not necessarily stop at the border (Elden 
2009; McConnell 2010; Kadercan 2015). The effective 
sovereignty of many states is reduced through various 
processes and global flows, alongside the widening 
range of non-state actors who might be seen to exert 
power across networks rather than over rigidly bor-
dered territory (Agnew 2005a). More broadly, some have 
begun to suggest that jurisdiction and sovereignty are 
not inextricably dependent on territory and boundaries, 
suggesting a need to think in terms of broader concep-
tualizations associated with religious law or ideas of 
natural law, for example (Miller 2013).
Apart from these state and sub-state examples, ter-
ritorial configurations exist at a variety of spatial scales. 
Although these may be less obvious and may often seem 
more vaguely defined with less clear-cut boundaries, 
these ‘informal’ divisions run through a wide range of 
social, cultural and political issues concerning race, class, 
gender and sexuality so that what can be termed spatial 
enclaves of varying degrees of permanence are regularly 
created and sustained (Sidaway 2007). The remainder of 
this chapter explores some of these examples, demon-
strating how particular social practices are spatialized 
and the ways in which territories are constructed, con-
tested and used to achieve particular outcomes. While the 
examples are arranged under distinct headings, it should 
be abundantly clear that many of the issues raised are 
interrelated (and also overlap with earlier chapters in 
the book and others in this section). Identity is a highly 
complex and contested term. People have more than one 
single identity: gender, sexuality and ethnicity cross-cut 
each other in a system of overlapping identities. Ethnic 
groups and classes are not immutable but are social con-
structs. In other words, they vary in time and space and 
are not simply natural categories, but human (or social)

quite different uses and symbolic meanings (Plate 21.2). 
In South Wales, for example, the regenerated Cardiff 
Bay area has been transformed from a place associated 
initially with the export of coal and subsequently with 
industrial decline and decay. Other UK cities like Glas-
gow, Liverpool and Birmingham continually engage in 
processes of re-imagination. Such processes are some-
times entwined with attempts to claim a ‘prize’ that may 
further enhance the city’s profile and boost its image, 
such as being crowned European Capital of Culture. 
The scale and extent of contemporary developments in 
global cities like New York and London, where a super-
rich elite engages in intense investment and conspicuous 
consumption, has led to the coining of the term super-
gentrification (Butler and Lees 2006). These attempts to 
purify urban space have led to the displacement of some 
urban residents while others are rendered homeless. In 
cities such as San Francisco fragile lives are lived out on 
the streets amidst an atmosphere in which the homeless 
are seen as a blot to be removed rather than a mani-
festation of a systemic problem. Homeless people are 
criminalized and medicalized so that urban space can be 
cleansed and put to more profitable uses (Gowan 2010).
Class-based segregation is rendered even more obvious 
through the long evident phenomenon of urban gating 
(Atkinson and Blandy 2006; Glasze et al. 2006; Bagaeen 
and Uduku 2010). The apparent rise in the numbers and 
varied forms of gated communities within urban areas in 
various parts of the world in recent years could be inter-
preted as a very obvious manifestation of attempts to 
control and limit access to portions of geographic space. 
The creation of residential fortresses where security 
guards patrol the perimeter of walled residential zones in 
market which effectively determines who can afford 
to live where. The ‘poor’ cannot afford to live in ‘rich’ 
areas and the rich are generally unlikely to want to 
reside in close proximity to poorer run-down neighbour-
hoods. Nevertheless, attempts to regenerate older work-
ing class areas tend simply to reshape the geographies 
of class rather than eliminate them. Gentrification is 
where parts of the urban area experience regeneration 
or renewal, resulting in more affluent residents moving 
in and displacing the original predominantly working-
class inhabitants. Driven in part by economic processes 
and in part through consumer choice, it serves to rein-
force economic divisions within society, thereby per-
petuating the idea that some households do not belong 
in particular places. Linked to this, it is argued that the 
role of urban ‘gatekeepers’ (such as estate agents) may 
play a key role here in altering (or endeavouring to main-
tain) the social composition of particular areas (Shaw 
2008). Gentrification reflects broader socio-economic 
processes and the resultant residential territorializa-
tions can be seen as an expression of both demand for 
housing (from homeowners) and supply of capital (from 
financial institutions). It serves to highlight how broader 
global processes play out alongside (and are implicated 
in) the destruction and reconstruction of local territo-
rialized identities (Butler 2007). The major regeneration 
schemes undertaken in recent decades in older industri-
alized and dockland areas in cities throughout Europe 
and North America reflect this transformation from 
manufacturing and working-class residential spaces into 
service sector zones with middle-class residents. Dock-
land and waterfront areas, like other ‘regenerated’ urban 
zones, have been transformed into different places, with

gating in its various guises touches on vitally impor-
tant questions of the privatization of previously public 
space, inclusion, exclusion and the territorialization 
of social life (Lemanski and Oldfield 2009; Rosen and 
Razin 2009). Extremely exclusive forms of gating can 
be recognized in places such as Dubai, Malaysia and 
Singapore. Pow (2011) points to the creation of micro-
territories (facilitated by state incentives) inhabited by 
a global elite who enjoy the specific environment while 
cocooned and protected from the outside world, though 
they are intimately connected to it in many other ways 
via work, travel, media and so on. Paradoxically, such 
mini-territories, though bordered and separated, func-
tion as inherently transnational spaces.
21.2.2 Ethnicity, ‘race’ and space
In the same way that class is mapped onto space, so too 
is ethnicity. Ideas of race are firmly embedded in everyday 
discourses but racial and ethnic categories are social con-
structions rather than innate biological realities. While 
race can be questioned as a problematic and dubious 
form of social classification there is no doubt that rac-
ism and ‘race thinking’ are very real social phenomena 
(Saldanha 2011). Kobayashi and Peake argue that race is 
socially constructed but that ‘racialization’ is ‘the pro-
cess by which racialized groups are identified, given ste-
reotypical characteristics, and coerced into specific living 
conditions, often involving social/spatial segregation and 
always constituting racialized places’ (2000: 293). While 
issues linked to ‘race’ are clearly social phenomena, they 
are often manifested spatially. Amongst the most rigid 
examples of racialized space was that devised under 
the apartheid system in South Africa from the late 1940s 
through to the early 1990s: a territorial system that 
enhanced and entrenched the political, economic and 
social power of a minority white population over non-
white populations. Both nationally and at the more local-
ized level of individual urban areas, space was divided on 
racial lines. Non-white people were ‘placed’ in locations 
not of their own choosing in order to entrench minor-
ity white power. In this way, there was a legal transposi-
tion of inequality on to geographical space. This spatial 
arrangement was designed to ensure greater degrees of 
control over the majority black population and is a clas-
sic example of the utilization of a territorial strategy to 
attain political objectives. At localized levels, there was a 
racialization of space with buses, public toilets and other 
amenities reflecting this divide. A racial ideology was 
mapped on to the South African landscape. Although 
apartheid ended in the early 1990s, after a long struggle 
for democratic rights for all in South Africa, its legacy 
means that a division of space based on the racial and 
an effort to exclude those seen as ‘undesirable’ has been 
repeated and deepened in many other cities in order to 
exclude those seen as not belonging there, so maintaining 
the ‘undefiled’ and ‘exclusive’ nature of the neighbour-
hood. The level of ‘fortification’ of these developments 
is quite varied ranging from perimeter walls, gates and 
barriers, through the limiting of non-residential access 
by intercoms and associated ‘screening’ devices, to more 
perceptual barriers or codes deterring access (Plate 21.3). 
Individual streets, where homes are owned by super-rich 
global elites, may be subject to private security and moni-
toring, as in parts of London. The general population is 
prevented, or at least discouraged, from traversing such 
spaces (Gentleman 2014).
The idea of gating can be seen as a consequence 
of two inter-connected factors: security and prestige. 
Though not strictly the preserve of the better-off, dis-
courses of safety and security serve as a useful rationale 
for developers to design, build and promote spatially 
exclusive housing often surrounded by security fences 
and with highly limited public access regulated by inter-
coms and other ‘screening’ technologies which have 
come to be regular features in contemporary landscapes 
of power. These territorial strategies work in ways which 
ensure a particular residential mix and may well serve to 
link together both racial and class divisions. These ten-
dencies have been facilitated by technological advances 
in recent decades through geodemographics and the 
use of postcode data and associated marketing strate-
gies of companies who are keen to identify particular 
types of consumer, and link these to geographic areas. 
In this way residential homogeneity is both reflected and 
reproduced. The social and the spatial are inextricably 
linked as ‘gated minds’ are translated into gated places 
(Landman 2010). While the forms it takes may vary 
somewhat according to place-specific circumstances,

depicted as untrustworthy and are subject to a range of 
discriminatory practices (Shubin 2011). Yet travellers 
also have nuanced notions of community, territory and 
belonging amidst movement that may parallel, as well 
as clash with, those of more ‘settled’ communities (see 
Convery and O’Brien 2012).
Leaving aside these overt and coercive examples, it is 
clear that many cities exhibit high degrees of ethnic seg-
regation. In most US cities and European cities, for exam-
ple, the elites and middle class are disproportionately 
white, reflecting the coincidence of class and ethnic seg-
regation (Crump 2004). These patterns of exclusion and 
inclusion and attendant territorialities reflect the complex 
intersections of race, class and ideology. In considering 
these spatial concentrations of ethnic groups in urban 
areas, it might be argued that individuals choose to locate 
in such areas for a variety of reasons. In brief there are a 
combination of ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ factors; for some 
there are attractions such as ‘being amongst one’s own’, 
while others may feel driven to seek sanctuary from a rac-
ist, hostile society. Clustering offers feelings of defence, 
mutual support and a sense of belonging and community. 
This in turn may be a useful means through which group 
cultural norms and heritage may be preserved. Cluster-
ing also produces spaces of resistance whereby external 
threats, whether to cultural norms or of physical attack, 
may be reduced. However, these arguments should not 
detract from the fact that residential clustering is often 
more a function of necessity rather than free and uncon-
strained choice. The idea that people may choose to 
cluster is to ignore the fact that quite often no easy alter-
natives are available. Discriminatory ideologies of race 
work to exclude people from particular areas through the 
class lines reinforced during the apartheid era has left 
enduring marks on the social landscape.
Elsewhere, nationalist conflicts may give rise to 
attempts to create ethnically pure spaces through the 
forcible removal of ethnic ‘others’. The phenomenon of 
ethnic cleansing in parts of the former Yugoslavia during 
the 1990s is a striking example of an attempt to ‘purify’ 
territory of those deemed to belong to other ethno-cul-
tural groups in an apparent attempt to justify territorial 
control in the name of the nation (Case study 21.1). In a 
not unrelated manner, the generally negative stereotyp-
ing of gypsies in much of Europe has led to consider-
able discrimination, with gypsies seen as an undesirable 
‘other’, as a consequence of which they are effectively 
de-territorialized; they are seen not to belong anywhere 
and active attempts are made to exclude them from cer-
tain spaces. In recent years there have been attempts to 
exclude gypsies from France through ‘repatriation’ of 
ethnic Roma (gypsy) people to Romania and Bulgaria, 
a flagrant breach of EU policy on freedom of move-
ment between member states. Collective expulsion was 
justified through a security discourse that portrayed the 
Roma as a threat to French society, culture and identity 
(Bărbulescu 2012). Broader issues emerge here in rela-
tion to groups which pursue nomadic lifestyles and who, 
consequently, are subject to considerable public oppro-
brium. Attempts by gypsies and other traveller groups 
to use particular spaces are often resisted by settled 
residents. As a group they are partly de-territorialized, 
simultaneously belonging everywhere and nowhere, 
their mobility juxtaposed to the settled nature of place-
based communities. The mobile lifestyles of some are 
seen as unnatural and those who practice them are often 
Case study 21.1 
Ethnic territorial cleansing
Following the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the early 
1990s, violent conflicts erupted in Croatia, Bosnia-
Herzegovina and, later, Kosovo. These ethno-national 
conflicts were characterized by attempts by various 
groups to eradicate other ethnic groups from ‘their’ 
territory. This strategy was built on an essentialist 
version of defining ethno-national identity and, quite 
literally, clearing the territory of those possessing 
a supposedly ‘different’ identity. Armed movements 
claiming to be representing Serbs, Croats and Bos-
nians (predominantly Muslims) tried to carve out 
spaces which they could call their own in the ruins of 
the former federal state. Viewed from the outside it is 
easy to argue that such a strategy is both dangerous 
and simplistic. However, for those directly involved the 
control of territory was seen as an essential element 
in the conflict. Despite the region’s complex multicul-
tural history, reductionist interpretations of identity 
led to attempts to assert territorial control through 
the elimination of ‘others’. Nationalist rhetoric, and 
the associated desire to control particular portions 
of territory in the name of a specific group, hardened 
divisions which were of relatively minor significance 
only a few years previously when Yugoslavia was a 
federal (and communist) republic under one-party 
rule. Once the conflict was underway, however, it 
➜

428    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
became impossible to reverse, as the conflict drew 
upon and reinforced group identities and compet-
ing territorial claims underpinned through reference 
to historical myths and forms of boundary-making, 
particularly within Bosnia. In order to achieve peace, 
areas were mapped and information gathered on the 
various ethno-national groupings living in different 
localities. In this way territory was designated ‘Serb’, 
‘Muslim’, ‘Croat’, and so on, with lines dividing towns 
and cities into different zones. After a number of 
failed alternatives, the Dayton Agreement of 1995 
divided Bosnia-Herzegovina into two autonomous 
units: a Muslim-Croat Federation and a Bosnian Serb 
Republic (Republika Srpska). While this solution was 
lauded in many circles, critics have argued that it is 
inherently unstable and that it also reinforces ethnic 
divisions rather than rising above them (Figure 21.1).
The partition of territories and ‘transfer’ of popula-
tions has occurred in many other situations of territo-
rial, ethno-cultural, national and state conflict. Greece 
and Turkey in the early 1920s, India and Pakistan in 
1947, Palestine and Israel in 1948 and Cyprus (whose 
northern part was occupied by Turkey in 1974) are all 
examples. Understanding them requires critical attention 
not only to the details of each case, but also to the con-
cepts (territoriality, the political geography of nations and 
states and geopolitics) and background that are consid-
ered both in this and the other chapters in this section.

linked to immigration, smuggling and security are seen 
as priorities. The manner in which policing is carried 
out also reflects ideas of territory and territorial control, 
ranging from police having particular ‘beats’ or zones of 
responsibility to the spatial tactics employed by police, 
for example funnelling street marches and protests along 
agreed routes. Policing of space does not just regulate 
that space, it also plays a role in the social construction 
of space and shapes the ways in which particular spaces 
are imagined (Herbert 1997, 2006).
While traditionally policing has been seen as the 
purview of state forces, in recent years, and in many 
countries, the nature of policing has become ever more 
complicated, with an expanding array of agencies with 
often overlapping geographic and authoritative remits 
(Yarwood 2007). The increasing array of non-state (pri-
vate) actors engaged in forms of policing also brings with 
it a series of additional territorializations, with private 
security firms patrolling office blocks and shopping 
malls, or controlling access to pubs and clubs, as well as 
running security screening at many airports and ports. 
These sometimes create various tensions over authority 
and power, including attempts to prevent people taking 
photographs in certain spaces. The advent of citizen-
based groups such as Neighbourhood Watch also rests 
on notions of local territories, with people encouraged 
to report suspicious behaviour. Current government 
strategies in the UK and elsewhere appear designed to 
deepen trends towards greater community control, the 
broadening of policing partnership arrangements and a 
significantly enhanced role for private security provid-
ers. Recent years have also seen an increasing range of 
security measures deployed in various contexts at places 
such as airports, national monuments and so on, which 
highlight tensions over the securitization of public space 
thereby placing constraints on freedom of movement 
while increasing levels of public surveillance (Benton-
Short 2007).
Policing is about more than simple law enforcement, it 
is also about the regulation and endorsement of specific 
values and moral codes (Mawby and Yarwood 2011). In 
addition to territorializations associated with the polic-
ing of space, there are those which endeavour to exclude 
individuals or particular forms of behaviour from cer-
tain spaces. In the United Kingdom, Anti-Social Behav-
iour Orders (ASBOs) and related instruments provide a 
controversial example of bringing a territorial approach 
to dealing with particular behaviours that are seen to con-
stitute a nuisance. They can be used to prevent specified 
individuals from being in particular places, streets, and 
so on, or to prevent individuals from repeatedly engaging 
in specified behaviours such as aggressive begging, dis-
turbing neighbours or drunkenness in public places. They 
operations of the housing market and other processes, 
thereby translating social exclusion into geographical 
exclusion (see Knox and Pinch 2010).
We should also be mindful of the fact that much 
discussion surrounding issues of ‘race’ and ethnicity 
in Western societies tends to assume ‘whiteness’ as the 
norm. As McGuinness (2000) argues, much progressive 
research itself falls into this trap with a focus on non-
white groups, tending to deflect attention away from 
white ethnicity. One consequence is that relatively little 
attention is given to ‘white spaces’. Ideas of white flight 
to the suburbs (in response to the evolution of ‘black’ 
ghettos) and the creation of ‘white’ territories are them-
selves elements in the racialization of space. Similarly 
the construction of rural Britain as a relatively ‘white 
space’ reflects deeply embedded ideas associated with 
belonging, rurality and with national identity (Hollo-
way 2005; Journal of Rural Studies, 25(4), 2009). Such 
constructions can have serious implications for those 
who do not (or are seen not to) ‘fit in’ with the dominant 
assumptions and ethos. Recent debates over immigra-
tion into the UK and other Western European countries, 
fuelled by populist right-wing politicians, have tended 
to focus on supposed ‘swarms’ of asylum seekers and 
‘illegals’, and ‘hordes’ of Eastern Europeans (Gilmartin 
2008; Storey 2013a). While much of this is inaccurate 
and misleading, the nature of the comments suggests 
that countries should increasingly seal themselves off 
from invasions from ‘outside’ by those who do not 
‘belong’ there. These arguments are often (misleadingly) 
bound into security discourses emphasizing the need to 
protect the country and its citizens. Territory, terror-
ism and identity become inextricably linked in debates 
calling into question who has the right to be in certain 
places and who has not. Additionally, countries are 
seen to extend their border controls well beyond their 
own territory with immigration personnel screening 
passports in foreign airports in order to interdict those 
deemed ‘illegal’ (Mountz 2009).
21.3 Geographies of security,  
policing and protest
Given the territorializations noted above it is worth 
exploring the ways in which space is policed. Fyfe initially 
drew attention to the geographies of policing in 1991. 
One elementary version of this is the division into police 
forces with responsibility for particular regions: West 
Mercia police in the UK and so on. Linked to this are 
ideas of particular spaces in which special units operate 
such as harbours and airports, where specific concerns 

430    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
exemplify a trend towards socio-spatial design whereby 
territorial strategies associated with crime prevention 
effectively exclude those not wanted. Some people are 
effectively barred from certain areas – a policy of territo-
rial containment enforced through increased surveillance 
and architectural design features. In part, these forms of 
exclusionary policing reflect broader geographies of fear 
and the perceived risk of crime associated both with spe-
cific groups and with specific geographic spaces (Pain and 
Smith 2008). Increasingly space is patrolled by private 
security companies whose remit is territorially circum-
scribed. In cities such as Cape Town in South Africa this 
produces a patchwork of fragmented spaces patrolled by 
different companies, leading to displacement of undesira-
bles from certain streets and commercial zones (Paache 
et al 2014).
While space is policed, it is also used to facilitate pro-
test, as marches, demonstrations, sit-ins or rallies happen 
in specific places. However, state authorities can delimit 
(or try to) where and when these may take place. Many 
countries honour the right to use public space to protest 
and permission to march through the streets is granted, 
though in most instances there is a requirement that routes 
must be pre-agreed and these events are generally heavily 
policed. In the UK in recent decades anti-war protests, 
as well as demonstrations by student groups opposed to 
higher fees for university education, have taken place in 
London and other cities. The Occupy Movement (see 
Case study 23.4 in Chapter 23) is a good example of a 
protest organized with a specific spatial dimension. Pro-
tests against global social and economic inequality and 
the wider capitalist system emerged in 2011. Individuals 
and groups were motivated by opposition to austerity 
measures seen to affect the more vulnerable within society 
while ignoring the deep-seated structural issues and the 
wider global financial architecture that enriched a minor-
ity at the expense of the majority. Using slogans such as 
‘we are the 99%’, these protests tapped into a collective 
feeling of unfairness and injustice. The initially spontane-
ous happenings saw an occupation of public space, itself 
a clear political statement, but the spaces themselves were 
symbolically chosen. Wall Street in New York (where the 
protests first emerged) is the US financial hub. Protest 
then spread to many other cities in the USA and other 
countries. The London version was initially intended for 
the stock exchange building, but heavy security meant 
it concentrated in the open space outside the nearby St 
Paul’s Cathedral at the edge of the city’s financial heart. 
Occupy and other social movements were simultaneously 
globally connected while being grounded in place. These 
protests, while drawing attention to serious global issues, 
also highlight the right to protest and the right to do so 
within particular spaces.
have proved controversial, seen by some as the criminali-
zation of certain social behaviours (Squires 2008). What 
they clearly do is suggest the idea that certain forms of 
behaviour are not allowed in public space and they can be 
punished with territorial exclusion. What is also clear is 
that they tend to be imposed on people in certain types of 
place, mainly areas of public housing in UK cities (Painter 
2006). Similar so-called ‘bubble’ laws in the USA also 
function to exclude people behaving in certain ways from 
specific places (Mitchell 2005). Regardless of our view of 
the rights and wrongs of such moves, and whether they 
might be deemed successful even on their own terms, they 
raise important geographical questions related to what is 
meant by ‘public’, who is allowed to be where, and how 
people are expected to behave (Cameron 2007).
Of course the ultimate spatial sanction for law-
breaking is imprisonment. In all societies, those who 
are convicted (or even in some cases simply accused) 
of criminal offences may also be excluded by territorial 
confinement (this is a key function of prisons) or con-
trols on their movement. Geographers have displayed 
an emerging interest in what have been termed carceral 
geographies with explorations of the geographic distribu-
tion of systems of incarceration and the experiences of 
these (Moran 2015). In the USA, the prison population 
has quadrupled in recent decades, so much so that a new 
extended geography of prisons and incarceration can be 
critically mapped (Gilmore 2007; Martin and Mitchel-
son 2009). In the current geopolitical climate, territory 
and territorial strategies are deployed in intriguing ways. 
The US prison camp at Guantánamo Bay (on the island 
of Cuba) is outside the territorial United States and 
its ambiguous territorial status has proven an effective 
excuse in allowing the indefinite detention without trial 
of its inmates who are simultaneously subject to interro-
gation by US military authorities (see Reid-Henry 2007).
At a more micro-scale, taken alongside the privatiza-
tion and ‘gating’ of residential zones, the proliferation 
of covered shopping malls can be seen as the erosion of 
shared urban street space and its replacement with privat-
ized, more exclusionary spaces of consumption. Where 
once streets were open to a broad public, there are now 
privatized spaces whose owners (invariably resorting to 
security firms who take on some police powers) can evict 
those seen to behave inappropriately or who simply look 
‘out of place’. The shopping mall has become a privat-
ized and highly regulated space in which people may 
be excluded by virtue of their appearance or behaviour 
(Staeheli and Mitchell 2006). Shopping complexes are 
considered private space into which people are ‘invited’ 
rather than having any automatic right to be there. These 
‘secure’ shopping centres, office blocks and apartment 
buildings, complete with gates and intercom systems,

feminist thought and practice have resulted in significant 
advances with regard to equal rights for women. While 
this can be seen within the arena of legislation in many 
countries associated with equal pay and related issues, it 
is also reflected in terms of spaces. Thus, the heightened 
visibility of women in public space reflects the changing 
status of women. Phenomena such as ‘reclaim the night’ 
marches demonstrate the overt use of a spatial strategy 
to make a political and human point. While particular 
groups may find themselves excluded from certain spaces, 
those spaces can also be reclaimed (Plate 21.4).
Historically, the gender division of labour tended 
to confine women to the private realm, leaving men 
to inhabit (much of) the public domain. This view of 
women as playing a subordinate role has in the past been 
reflected in discriminatory attitudes and practices, par-
ticularly in relation to women in the paid workforce, with 
active discouragement through lower wages, if not actual 
exclusion, from many jobs. These views are predicated 
on the undesirability of women going out to work. It can 
be argued that this ascribing of women’s role, through 
delimiting the spaces in which women were encouraged 
to appear, is another spatial expression of power. In 
other words, the confining of women to domestic space, 
and their exclusion from male territories, was a key ele-
ment in male control (see Little 2002). With increasing 
female participation in the workforce and a raft of equal 
opportunities legislation in many countries, such a gen-
eralization may appear to have lost some of its validity. 
Nevertheless, the division between a (largely) male pub-
lic sphere and a (largely) female private sphere still has 
considerable resonance in many societies (although the 
extent of this is itself immensely geographically variable 
across the world).
Where women enter the workforce, they may still 
encounter territorial divisions in the workplace. Thus, 
21.4 Territoriality, gender and sexuality
21.4.1 Gendered spaces
As with race and class, issues of gender are mapped on 
to space in various ways and the implications of gender 
are seen to be as important as other political, social and 
economic factors in the structuring of spaces and places. 
In its most simple form this is reflected in the sexist 
notion that ‘a woman’s place is in the home’. The home 
has tended to be seen as a space of reproduction juxta-
posed to the workplace as a space of production (Laurie 
et al. 1999). Underpinning this are ideas that distinguish 
between sex as a biological fact and sex as gender, which 
refers to the socially constructed roles of both male and 
female identities. In emphasizing the role of social con-
ditioning, the argument is that as individuals we are not 
biologically predetermined to be more suited to some 
roles rather than to others.
One reason for the relative absence of women in par-
ticular places is overt discrimination or active discour-
agement in the sense of certain activities or pursuits not 
being deemed suitable for women. Historically, women 
who transgressed these boundaries were often portrayed 
in a negative light, an idea reflective of notions of ‘good’ 
and ‘bad’ women. Women out alone at night might be 
seen as not conforming to what is expected of them. A 
crucial aspect of the relationship between women and 
place centres on the perception of some specific places as 
‘unsafe’. Many women do not feel safe in certain public 
places, most notably darkened streets. As Valentine (1989) 
suggested, women transfer a fear of male violence into a 
fear of certain spaces, which has profound implications 
for the ways in which men and women negotiate their 
way through urban areas. Clearly, the various strands of

(Oksana Perkins/fotolia)
Geography, 25(8), 2006; Browne et al. 2007). At its most 
elementary level this has seen the mapping of gay and 
lesbian ‘zones’ in selected cities. It is fair to point out 
that such spaces are not as easy to identify as, say, areas 
inhabited predominantly by a particular ethnic group. 
It is equally obvious that, in the main, these are not 
strictly demarcated areas. Rather, they are zones where 
gay people may feel more at ease through being accepted 
rather than rejected, scorned or ignored (or worse) by 
their neighbours. The mapping of ‘gay territories’ runs 
the risk of focusing on what some see as deviant behav-
iour as well as essentializing sexuality and reinforcing a 
gay/straight dichotomy. Nevertheless, the fact that those 
who identify themselves as gay and lesbian do, in some 
instances, become associated with particular (usually 
urban) spaces, suggests that another form of territorial 
behaviour may be evident. A concentration of visibly gay 
restaurants, bars and clubs results in the creation of what 
Castells calls ‘a space of freedom’ (1997: 213). Places such 
as the Castro District of San Francisco (Plate 21.5) and 
the more spatially confined ‘gay village’ in Manchester 
serve as important examples, while the city of Brighton 
has acquired an image as the ‘gay capital’ of the UK 
(Browne and Lim 2010).
Spain (1992) documents the ‘closed door’ jobs of managers 
(mainly men) and the ‘open floor’ jobs of manual workers 
(who may be predominantly women in certain countries/
regions/sectors). Employers may locate in particular local-
ities (or countries) in order to take advantage of what they 
see as an available (and exploitable) workforce based on 
prevailing wage levels or skills and assumptions about 
gender roles (Hanson and Pratt 1995). The presence of 
women in the armed forces periodically provokes debate 
over the supposed appropriateness of women performing 
such roles. The deaths of female soldiers in recent years 
in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have been depicted in 
especially poignant terms in the media while the appro-
priateness of women being engaged in military activity in 
a war zone, rather than being at ‘home’ playing the key 
role in bringing up children is never far below the surface. 
In Iraq and Syria in 2014–15, Islamic State’s recruitment 
of young women (expected to perform support roles, 
rather than ‘front line’ action) has also provoked sets of 
responses which reflect the perceived ‘abnormality’ of 
women participating in violent actions. Social processes 
reproduce attitudes that tend to ‘naturalize’ a gendered 
division of labour in which women perform certain func-
tions which are acted out in specific spaces, for exam-
ple ‘home-making’ and child-rearing in domestic space. 
Socially constructed gendered difference is inherently also 
spatialized. Within the arena of sport and leisure, gender 
stereotyping remains prevalent. While there are undoubt-
edly marked changes, gendered ideas and practices about 
leisure activities and, hence, separate spaces for men and 
women, are still common. Such social practices are built 
upon ideas of what is or is not acceptable behaviour for 
men and women to engage in (built on socially or cultur-
ally constructed notions of masculinity and femininity) 
and where. Stereotypes of women spending leisure time 
shopping while men attend sporting events, or watch them 
on television at home or in pubs, have a self-perpetuating 
quality. Within most Western societies, deep-seated ideas 
about woman’s role as homemaker, cook, cleaner, child-
rearer, and so on, mean that women have often been his-
torically presumed to ‘belong’ in some rooms and spaces 
more than others. While such ideas have been challenged 
(and in many cases transformed), they sometimes endure. 
All these reflect territorial expressions of power whereby 
the designation or apportionment of space within the 
domestic sphere reflects the relative status or roles of the 
individuals concerned.
21.4.2 Sexuality and space
The idea of places territorialized by particular groups 
on the basis of sexual orientation has begun to receive 
more academic attention in recent years (see Political 

Chapter 21  Territory, space and society    433
of urban regeneration or place promotion is problematic. 
The complex intersections between different identities 
can create specific tensions which play out in different 
ways in different places. For example, the ways in which 
gay and lesbian identities are interconnected with pro-
cesses of gentrification through which they take on a spa-
tial dimension is apparent in places such as the Marais 
district in Paris where tensions between ‘old’ and ‘new’ 
residents and within the ‘gay community’ emerge (Siba-
lis 2004). Similarly, the intersections of sexualized and 
racialized identities in post-apartheid Cape Town serve as 
another useful insight into how issues of identity play out 
in specific contexts (Tucker 2009). The relations between 
class, capital, sexual identity and place may be manifested 
in various complex ways. Sexual citizenship becomes 
implicated in wider processes of urban transformation 
while sexualized spaces may continue to be quite highly 
regulated (Bell and Binnie 2004). The perception of gay 
spaces as the effective preserve of white gay males may 
lead to the emergence of different types of ‘queer’ neigh-
bourhoods. As Nash (2013) highlights, Toronto’s gay vil-
lage is effectively incorporated into the wider image and 
social, economic and political structures of the city. In 
this way, it has been argued both gay identities and the 
spaces associated with them have become increasingly 
commodified.
It might be argued that it is acceptable to be openly 
gay in an area so designated but in other spaces and soci-
eties the pressure to keep this identity hidden may well 
persist. While gay spaces may allow for more open expres-
sions of sexual identity, homophobic assaults on sexual 
minorities reflect contested place meanings (Sumartojo 
2004). Openly gay behaviour may be accepted or toler-
ated in some places but may remain decidedly unaccep-
table elsewhere. Here of course there are profound links 
between the small-scale (often neighbourhood or urban) 
territorialities and the wider policies of the city or state 
concerned. Many countries still criminalize gay sexuality 
and almost everywhere sexual mores and regulations are 
highly territorialized.
21.5 Work, rest and play
We can recognize two important social tendencies that 
bolster territoriality: the wish by people to have space of 
their own and the wish by others to exclude people from 
certain spaces. We have already seen ample evidence of 
the latter in this chapter. Even in what might appear to be 
very mundane or innocuous ways, the apparent claim to 
territory seems to manifest itself. At its most elementary 
level, the assertion of territoriality is reflected in claims 
The construction of such zones may arise for reasons 
similar to those associated with ghettos and other forms 
of segregated space. Castells (1997) has argued that 
there are two key factors: protection and visibility. The 
first of these is fairly obvious. The idea of ‘strength in 
numbers’ may make people feel safer from homophobic 
‘gaybashers’. Visibility may have an emancipatory effect 
through which identification as gay or lesbian within a 
culture that is predominantly straight (heterosexual) and 
in which a straight discourse dominates, may work to 
nullify views that see homosexuality as deviant or abnor-
mal. Gay neighbourhoods become a means of asserting 
identities. The significance of San Francisco’s gay area 
was reflected in that community’s ability to gain politi-
cal representation. In obtaining power over territory they 
also gained political representation and San Francisco has 
become recognized as something of a ‘gay capital’ of the 
United States with a somewhat more liberal attitude. In 
this way, the designation of ‘gay territories’ plays a crucial 
role in raising awareness of gay people and issues and 
also provides a means by which some degree of power 
and self-confidence can be attained. Celebratory events 
such as ‘gay pride’ marches can be seen as an assertion of 
citizenship rights through staking a claim to public space. 
Conversely, heightened visibility may render people tar-
gets for homophobic assault, both verbal and physical. 
The examples of gay and lesbian spaces suggest another 
important point, that of the temporality of territory. The 
longevity of these spaces may be quite brief as the ‘scene’ 
moves to somewhere else. Lesbian spaces may be very 
short-lived in time, whether caused by the transience of 
lesbian bars/clubs or the even more short-term phenom-
ena of lesbian or gay evenings.
Of course, such places and events may be inextricably 
bound up with factors that extend well beyond the realm 
of identity. ‘Gay spaces’ have often been associated with 
an economic imperative as the importance of the ‘pink 
pound (dollar, or euro)’ in aiding urban regeneration 
has frequently added a strong commercial angle to these 
developments. As with ‘ethnic’ spaces, one consequence 
may be the ‘co-option’ of the identity in order to present 
an ‘acceptable’ image of the group concerned which feeds 
into broader strategies of place promotion. Not surpris-
ingly, some activists have expressed disquiet over the 
appropriation of such events and their dislocation from 
their original social and cultural roots and from their 
original territorial base. The fact that Manchester’s ‘gay 
village’ and San Francisco’s Castro District are firmly on 
the tourist trails of their respective cities may be lauded 
as an acceptance of identities previously scorned but it 
can also be seen as a commercialization of that identity 
which may, to some extent, serve to further ghettoize it. 
The instrumental use of an identity for wider purposes 

434    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
women and younger people within this domestic space, 
as discussed earlier (McDowell 1999). While the home is 
commonly depicted as a refuge from the outside world it 
may also be a site for domestic violence and fear (Squire 
and Gill 2011). Similarly teenagers may view the home 
as somewhere to escape from. In any event, the emphasis 
on the domestic idyll may have highly exclusionary con-
sequences (Delaney 2005).
Even within buildings territorial behaviour can be 
recognized. As we have seen, the idea of the kitchen as 
a ‘woman’s place’ is one example of this. The domestic 
home in many different cultural contexts is often spatially 
divided, not just in terms of gender but also in terms of 
age, with certain spaces being designated for women or 
for children (Spain 1992). The banning of children from 
some rooms and the proprietorial attitude towards one’s 
own room in a house are other examples of this. In the 
home, space is even being claimed at the level of ‘my chair’, 
‘my place at the table’ and so on. There are also distinc-
tions amongst those allowed in, with differential access 
for close family and friends on the one hand and more 
casual acquaintances on the other. Even then, friends may 
be welcomed into the living room but are less likely to be 
invited into the more ‘private’ spaces such as bedrooms 
(Morley 2000). In any consideration of the home, we need 
to be mindful that it is not a straightforward and unam-
biguous entity. While for some it conjures up feelings of 
comfort and security, for others it may be a place of dis-
comfort, alienation and tension (Blunt and Dowling 2006). 
For some the home may come to feel like a prison – quite 
literally so for those sentenced to home imprisonment or 
the many others subject to degrees of curfew, control and 
house arrest. Home is therefore a social construction in 
which social identities are (re)produced but which conveys 
different meanings to different people.
Equally, in workplaces some areas and rooms can 
only be entered by staff of a certain level and are out of 
bounds to more junior staff (Case study 21.2). These can 
be interpreted as managerial strategies designed to ensure 
a particular outcome; staff know their ‘place’ and can be 
more effectively controlled, sometimes through very obvi-
ous visual intrusion. Hanson and Pratt (1995) reveal how 
companies reproduce social segregation through spatial 
practices within the workplace whereby different sets of 
workers inhabit different parts of the factory and rarely, 
if ever, meet. Thus, office staff may be located downstairs 
in ‘cubicles’ separated by room dividers, with sales staff 
and management upstairs in individual or shared offices 
while production staff are located in an entirely separate 
part of the building. Socializing between workers often 
reflects their spatial segregation with limited social con-
tact between them. Work hierarchies are reflected in the 
spatial arrangements of the workplace. These practices 
to private property. Thus, people desire to mark their 
own home, to adorn it in their chosen style (influenced 
of course by social trends, technologies and fashions) 
and, in various ways, to mark it out as theirs. Homeown-
ers are generally keen to stamp their personality on their 
home through the ways in which they choose to deco-
rate it, alterations to layout, choice of colour schemes, 
furnishings and so on. This personalizing of space is 
further manifested through such things as the display of 
paintings, posters or photographs and the collection and 
arrangement of ornaments. The geographer Jean Gott-
man suggested that people ‘always partitioned the space 
around them carefully to set themselves apart from their 
neighbours’ (1973: 1). This manifestation is commonly 
interpreted as being symptomatic of our inherently ter-
ritorial nature. This emphasis on the centrality of the 
home also has a broader cultural and political signifi-
cance. Symbolic connections are often made between the 
domestic home and the nation whereby images of the 
former are seen to give material meaning to the latter. 
The home is seen in some ways to be at the heart of the 
nation. In times of war, for example, people have been 
encouraged to fight for the ‘homeland’ and the defence 
of ‘hearth and home’.
Private property is regarded by many as an outcome 
of human territorial behaviour and it represents a claim 
to space that is reinforced by the legal system of many 
countries. However, as Alland points out, it might well 
be the case that ‘private property is the child of culture 
and develops into a major preoccupation only with the 
evolution of complex society’ (1972: 64). It follows that 
we need to be careful to avoid the trap of translating a 
need for personal space into an ideological claim for 
the sanctity of private property. The centrality of the 
family home, encapsulated in such phrases as ‘home, 
sweet home’, glosses over the fact that the privacy which 
many of us associate with the home is comparatively 
recent and is specific to some societies. Where ‘domes-
tic’ space is limited (or for those who find it constrains 
them), life may be lived in the street (or perhaps the mall 
or car), much more evidently than the ‘behind four walls’ 
lifestyle many take as ‘natural’. We need to be mindful 
of social, ethnic and geographic differences in the ways 
in which the home is conceived. In the United Kingdom, 
the notion of private home space was initially quite a 
middle-class idea which has since permeated the rest of 
society (Morley 2000).
Hegemonic ideas of the home within Western socie-
ties, exemplified by such notions as the home being an 
‘Englishman’s castle’ or associated with ‘The Ameri-
can Dream’, can be argued to have led to an ignoring 
of internal tensions and, in particular, a consideration 
of the different positions, roles and experiences of men, 

Chapter 21  Territory, space and society    435
resent others ‘invading’ their space (unless invited!). This 
can be interpreted as a territorial claim to a portion of 
geographic space. While this might be taken as reflecting 
a natural tendency, it is worth noting that the amount of 
space needed appears to vary from one society to another, 
a fact noted long ago by Hall (1959). For many young peo-
ple, their own room, apartment, etc., may seem like a ‘nat-
ural’ ambition, but for many of the world’s inhabitants 
have clear outcomes. They may render it difficult for 
workers to organize through physically keeping them 
separate and through engendering a sense of difference 
between different sections of the workforce.
Taking the idea of territory down to its most elemen-
tary level, the desire for personal space can be seen as 
a form of territorial behaviour. Humans like to have a 
pocket of space around them that is ‘theirs’ and they 
Case study 21.2 
Playgrounds and lecture halls
There has been a growing interest recently in the 
geographies of younger people (see Holloway and 
Valentine 2000; Leyshon 2008; Yarwood and Tyrrell 
2012) and as an example of micro-scale territoriality 
it is instructive to consider the space of the school 
playground. Thomson (2005) suggests that while chil-
dren’s behaviour is clearly spatialized in a wide vari-
ety of ways, it might be thought that the playground 
is ‘their’ space in which school children can enjoy a 
degree of freedom to engage in a range of activities 
as distinct from the constraints imposed in the more 
formalized and controlled spaces of the classroom 
or other parts of the school buildings and grounds. 
However, while play spaces can be seen as eman-
cipatory they are simultaneously regulating. Thom-
son’s research indicates that on closer inspection 
the playground displays two key criteria associated 
with territories and territoriality. First, it remains heav-
ily controlled by adults (teaching staff) who delimit 
the times it can be used and the activities which are 
permitted there. Second, it often contains internal ter-
ritorial divisions in the sense of discrete spaces for 
different types of ‘play’ activity – sports, etc. What is 
also obvious of course is that children themselves 
will often endeavour to claim their own territory within 
the larger space of the playground with groups ‘hang-
ing out’ in particular places. In addition it is equally 
apparent that these spatial practices are open to 
contestation. Rival groups of children may ‘compete’ 
for spaces within the playground. What is also appar-
ent is the manner in which children may try to test or 
push the spatial boundaries imposed by teachers and 
supervisors through such actions as encroaching on 
grass playing pitches and so on. Another important 
dimension of this (in addition to classification, com-
munication, enforcement and resistance) is the way 
in which the control of territory is masked through 
recourse to other discourses such as that of health 
and safety – prohibiting access to spaces deemed 
dangerous or hazardous (Thomson 2005).
In a similar vein we might take the example of the 
university teaching room. Here a lecturer may exert a 
strong degree of territorial control; occupying a space 
at the top of the room while controlling (or trying to) 
who else may speak and when they may do so. Even 
in highly interactive and more student-led sessions, a 
lecturer, by virtue of their status, continues to exert con-
trol over the space. She or he can ‘command’ the room 
and walk around it in ways which students cannot (or 
are discouraged from doing). However, such control has 
very obvious temporal constraints. What the students 
and lecturer may regard as ‘their’ room is usually limited 
to a regular time-tabled slot. Before and after that time, 
their right to be there is denied as other lecturers and 
students take over the space and control it. Your geog-
raphy lecturer is unlikely to walk into a lecture theatre 
during a biochemistry class and commence to speak 
to the assembled students. (Well, they might try to do 
so but they would be met by a bewildered reaction and, 
more than likely, a phone call to security!) (Plate 21.6).

436    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
such a desire is completely unobtainable. For those liv-
ing in overcrowded conditions, the amount of personal 
space available is extremely limited. For a homeless per-
son, their ‘own’ space may be limited to a hostel bed in 
central London, a doorway in downtown Manhattan, or 
a small patch of pavement in the Tenderloin district in 
San Francisco (Gowan 2010). Nurture, culture, power and 
politics all need to be considered where the complexities 
and diversities of human territorialities are concerned.
Sport provides an example of an activity in which terri-
tory and space are of obvious importance. Sport is deeply 
connected to questions of place and identity with some 
sports intrinsically connected to particular places, Gaelic 
games in Ireland being a classic example (Storey 2012a). 
Particular spaces are required for sports and these range 
from formal arenas and large stadia down to the level of 
the street or indeed to a corner of a room, depending on 
the sport. Sports grounds and facilities occupy areas of 
urban and rural space and we can consider these in rela-
tion to wider ideas of inclusion and exclusion. Issues of 
gender or ethnicity may be important here and the main-
tenance of men only rules at some sports facilities results 
in a highly gendered division of recreational space. Sports 
such as football and rugby thrive on inter-place rivalry and 
fans come to closely identify with their sporting ‘home’. 
In some instances this rivalry may be at a relatively local-
ized, yet highly intense, scale such as that between Arsenal 
and Tottenham Hotspur football clubs in north London. 
In some cases wider social issues may overlay geographic 
rivalry, as with Celtic and Rangers football clubs in Glas-
gow, Scotland where sectarian division between Protestants 
and Catholics is part of the cultural context for the antipa-
thy between supporters. At a still more micro-scale fans 
will occupy different sections of a ground, usually related 
to security considerations designed to keep ‘home’ and 
‘away’ supporters apart. In some cases minorities of sup-
porters may try to ‘take’ the home section of ground while 
visiting fans sometimes like to be seen to assert control 
over some bars and streets in the ‘host’ city or town, a ver-
sion of territoriality of very short duration. In sport itself 
territorial strategies of dominating the pitch, or areas of 
it, may be a fundamental tactic. In rugby endeavouring to 
keep play in the opposition’s half is a normal tactic while 
tennis players may wish to dominate the court as a means 
of dominating their opponent.
21.6 Conclusions
The idea of territory reflects a way of thinking about 
geographic space while territorial strategies are utilized 
in conflicts concerned with social power and identity. 
Territorial thinking, the production of territories and the 
employment of territorial strategies are bound up with 
maintaining power or with resisting the imposition of 
power by a dominant group. While forms of exclusion can 
be consolidated and reinforced through territorial prac-
tices, they can also be resisted through similar means. The 
examples provided in this chapter are evidence of the ways 
in which social relations are expressed through spatial 
patterns and they highlight how these geographies help 
in turn to shape social relations. Social phenomena such 
as class, racial or gendered identities invariably embody a 
territorial component. Territorial strategies are often used 
to control and police those who are defined as ‘out of 
(their) place’. In this way particular ideologies are trans-
posed on to space. People are confronted with wider prac-
tices through their use of space or through the ways in 
which they are allowed to use space. Power relationships 
take on a spatial dimension, even at the most mundane 
and everyday level. Issues of identity, particularly within 
multi-cultural societies, have a spatial expression as social 
divisions (associated with class, ethnic, religious, gender 
or other factors) are given material form through spatial 
divisions. The examples used here demonstrate the spa-
tialization of wider ideas and they show how people are 
kept ‘in their place’ whether through overt mechanisms or 
more subtle means. Social boundaries are often commu-
nicated through space. This can have serious implications 
with some groups of people effectively treated as ‘second-
class (or indeed as non-) citizens’ denied full rights in the 
society in which they find themselves, confined to spatial 
enclaves which become characterized as dangerous and 
threatening spaces. Social and spatial exclusion has the 
effect of denying full access to those rights often thought 
of as inalienable for all people everywhere. Many territo-
rial strategies have deeply discriminatory and exclusion-
ary outcomes giving rise to social and spatial exclusion. 
They can be used to deny people effective participation 
in society through restricting choice, mobility and pos-
sibilities to participate. However, as indicated earlier, 
just as dominant ideologies can be reinforced through 
territorial practices, they can also be resisted. Territorial 
strategies are useful mechanisms in the assertion of iden-
tity. Spatial concentrations within particular geographic 
areas make visible people and issues that might otherwise 
remain unseen. They can be used to draw attention to 
exclusionary practices and to assert the right to be equal 
citizens. In doing so, this demonstrates the ‘positive’ and 
‘negative’ dimensions to territoriality; it can be both a 
force for oppression and also one for liberation. Particular 
strategies can be used to assert an identity and territori-
ally transgressive acts can be employed to reclaim space 
and, hence, to assert basic rights. While many people 
do not necessarily freely choose their ‘place’, they may, 

Chapter 21  Territory, space and society    437
nevertheless, identify with their immediate neighbour-
hood or locality. This sense of identity can in turn be 
converted into forms of action aimed at obtaining par-
ticular outcomes. The formation of community or resi-
dence groups reflects feelings of belonging or attachment 
to a particular place. It follows that notions of territory 
are connected with ideas of social power. The claiming 
of space is a political act whether it occurs in the ‘public’ 
or ‘private’ arena (and the categorization and demarca-
tion of these areas is a key expression of territoriality) 
and territories provide a material expression of the fusion 
of meaning, power and social space (Delaney 2009). In 
other words, power permeates society and this is some-
thing which is marked in and expressed through a range 
of human geographies. As the next chapter details, the 
nation-state has come to be a key container of power and 
an expression of human territoriality. As such, nation-
states are frequently contested, not only by other states, 
but also by those acting in the name of other loyalties and 
other scales and ideologies of belonging.

of territory and the relationships between territories and geo-

historically about how territory has evolved. See, in particular,

The territory of a nation is not just a profane part of the Earth’s 
surface. It is a constitutive element of nationhood which gener-
ates plenty of other concepts and practices directly related to it: 
for example, the concepts of territorial integrity and political sov-
ereignty; border control, conflict, invasion and war. It defines and 
has some control over many other national affairs, such as the 
national economy, products, industry, trade, education, administra-
tion, culture and so on. Unarguably, the territory of a nation is the 
most concrete feature of a nation for the management of nationhood 
as a whole. For a theoretical geographer, it is the territoriality of a 
nation . . . For people of a nation; it is a part of SELF, a collective 
self. It is a nation’s geo-body . . . . The geo-body, the territoriality of 
a nation as well as its attributes such as sovereignty and boundary, 
are not only political but also cultural constructs.

Chapter 22

22.1 Historical and geographical 
­variability of states
Although it is also other things, notably a provider of 
services, a system of regulations, ideologies, legal regula-
tions and police powers (‘law and order’), flows of capi-
tal (budgets, taxation and government spending) backed 
up by the threat of discipline and violence (for example, 
armed forces), the state can be interpreted as a form of 
community. As earlier chapters (in particular those in 
Section 1) have shown, forms of human community and 
their attendant territorialities (see Chapter 21) have been 
extremely variable historically and geographically.
The contemporary system of states, in which all of 
the land surface of the earth (with the partial exception 
of Antarctica as is detailed in Chapter 20) is divided into 
state units, whose outlines become familiar to us from 
maps and globes, is after all fairly new. In the early twen-
tieth century, the borders between many of today’s states 
were only vaguely defined, and more recently large areas 
of the world were ruled by colonial empires or dynastic 
realms (the Austro-Hungarian in Central Europe, Otto-
man in the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean, and 
Ch’ing empire in China, for example). Alternatively, the 
concept of nation-statehood was simply not in the politi-
cal vocabulary. In the latter cases, ethnically, linguistically 
or religious specific groups owed allegiance to the impe-
rial order rather than to a defined nation. That is, loy-
alty would be foremost to the empire and any sense of 
national or ethnic identity would be a local or ‘private’ 
matter.
Such imperial visions are no longer dominant and 
today few formal colonies and no large-scale dynastic 
empires remain (see Chapter 3). Therefore the territories 
that were once ruled as part of, for example, a Japanese, 
British, French, Ottoman (Turkish), Portuguese or Rus-
sian empire are today mostly divided into self-avowed and 
recognized sovereign states. They possess the same appa-
ratus of statehood (leaders, flags, capital cities, adminis-
trations, postage stamps, seats at the United Nations and 
so on) that the former imperial powers have. Moreover, 
the global map of states continues to change. In recent 
decades, some have disappeared as separate states (like 
the former East Germany and South Yemen), whilst oth-
ers have split into two or sometimes many component 
parts (like the former USSR, Ethiopia, Sudan and Yugo-
slavia), and others have been subject to violent fragmen-
tation fuelled by civil unrest, internal and external power 
plays using coercive force (such as Syria and Somalia). 
All this reinforces the point that states, like other com-
munities, particularly the ‘nations’ with which they are 
associated, are not to be taken at face value. The claims 
made for and on behalf of them deserve critical examina-
tion. However, this is not an easy task. For, as Benjamin 
Akzin (1964) pointed out over half a century ago, to dis-
cuss nations, states and nationalism is to enter a termino-
logical maze in which one easily and soon becomes lost. 
Claims to nationhood frequently involve the blending of 
‘tangibles’ and ‘intangibles’ in a unique brew that may 
contain such volatile ingredients as ‘blood’, language, 
‘race’ and religion. A fundamental goal of nationhood is 
to generate a strong sense of belonging associated with 
a particular territory. In practice it may prove difficult to 
distinguish between ‘the nation’ and other human col-
lectivities, but as Walker Connor (1994: 93) puts it, ‘what 
ultimately matters is not what is but what people believe 
is’. This chapter will indicate some pathways into the 
maze of tangibles and intangibles surrounding the term 
nation-state. It begins with an account of ‘nations’ and 
nationalism before returning to the relationship of these 
to states.
22.2 Nations as ‘imagined’ political 
communities
One of the most influential and suggestive critical stud-
ies of nations and nationalism was a book by Benedict 
Anderson (1983) entitled Imagined Communities: Reflec-
tions on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism. He 
begins with a reminder of the ubiquity of nations and 
nationalism:
Almost every year the United Nations admits new 
members. And many ‘old nations’ once thought fully 
consolidated find themselves challenged by ‘sub’-
nationalisms within their borders – nationalisms

violence: armed forces.

of higher-level collectivities not directly but only by 
virtue of their membership of lower-level bodies.
In many parts of the pre-colonial world, sovereignty was 
not based upon fixed boundaries and territorial control 
per se. For instance, much of North Africa and the Mid-
dle East had very different forms of political sovereignty in 
pre-modern times. According to George Joffé (1987: 27):
political authority was expressed through communal 
links and was of varying intensity, depending on a series 
of factors involving, inter alia, tradition, geographic 
location and political relationships. The underlying 
consideration, however, was common throughout the 
region and involved a concept of political sovereignty 
that derived from Islamic practice. The essential con-
dition was that ruler and ruled were bound together 
through a conditional social contract in which the ruler 
could expect loyalty in return for enduring the condi-
tions in civil society for the correct practice of Islam.
Not surprisingly, many of the colonially inspired geo-
metrical boundaries that define the modern states of the 
Middle East and North Africa have limited relation to 
pre-colonial political landscapes. They have faced post-
colonial challenges, by nationalists who argued they did 
not coincide with where national borders should be and 
by those who refute them in the name of confessional 
(religious) identity, most dramatically the leaders of the 
self-declared Islamic State that emerged in Iraq and Syria 
in 2014. Similarly, in many pre-colonial Asian states, the 
emphasis of sovereignty was not on the territorial limits 
of control ‘but on pomp, ceremony and the sacred archi-
tecture of the symbolic centre’ (Clarke 1996: 217). In the 
classical Indianized states of South and South-east Asia, 
sovereignty was often focused on rulers who claimed divin-
ity, and further eastwards, emperors held the ‘mandate of 
Heaven’, and the mandarins’ right to exercise their author-
ity was derived from their being ‘superior men’ (Sino-Viet-
namese, quan-tu; Chinese chun-tzu) ‘who acted according 
to Confucian ideals’ (Keyes 1995: 195). But it would be 
too simplistic to think of sovereignty purely in terms of 
emperors, kings, queens, chiefs and so on, as ruler-ruled/
state-society relations in pre-modern societies were often 
complex, hierarchical, shifting and not based on strict ter-
ritoriality. O.W. Wolters (1982: 16–7) described the scheme 
of power relations in South-east Asia as mandala (a San-
skrit word that defies easy translation, but which refers to 
a political apparatus that was without fixed boundaries, 
but which rested on the authority of a central court):
[The] mandala represented a particular and often 
unstable political situation in a vaguely definable geo-
graphical area without fixed boundaries and where 
smaller centers tended to look in all directions for 
which naturally dream of shedding this subness one 
happy day. The reality is quite plain: the ‘end of the era 
of nationalism’, so long prophesied, is not remotely in 
sight. Indeed, nationness is the most universally legiti-
mate value in the political life of our time.
(Anderson 1983: 3)
Although enormously variable between, say, Nepali, 
Israeli, Singaporean, Nicaraguan, Vietnamese, Eritrean, 
American, Greek, Turkish and Irish versions, the ide-
ology of nationalism holds that everyone will have a 
primary identity with a particular ‘nation’. Such commu-
nities should be able to express themselves in a state; that 
is, they should enjoy what is called ‘sovereignty’ within 
certain geographical boundaries. ‘Sovereignty’, which 
is a term of long vintage and was previously associated 
with royal dynasties (the sovereign monarch), shifts to 
the ‘people’ of a ‘nation’, and even if a royal figurehead 
is retained, she or he will have to become in some way a 
‘national’ symbol. However, it is important to remember 
that territorial sovereignty as depicted on the world polit-
ical map of today is of relatively recent origin (see Section 
22.3), that more differentiated forms of sovereignty and 
other territorialities have existed in the past, and that sov-
ereignty is continually being challenged in various ways.
Examples of quite different conceptions of sovereignty 
in the past are abundant in many parts of the world, from 
medieval Europe to most parts of the pre-colonial world. 
The labyrinthine world of medieval times in Europe was 
at some levels intensely ‘local’, involving much smaller 
communities and political units than today, although 
these were usually a ‘part of a complex hierarchy of polit-
ical or cultural entities, such as the Church of Rome, the 
Hanseatic League, or the dynastic Habsburg Empire’ (J. 
Anderson 1986: 115). Sovereignty was not rigidly territo-
rial as it mostly is with modern nation-states (see Chap-
ters 1 and 2). As James Anderson (1995: 70) explained:
Political sovereignty in medieval Europe was shared 
between a wide variety of secular and religious institu-
tions and different levels of authority – feudal knights 
and barons, kings and princes, guilds and cities, bish-
ops, abbots, the papacy – rather than being based on 
territory per se as in modern times. Indeed the territo-
ries of medieval European states were often discontin-
uous, with ill-defined and fluid frontier zones rather 
than precise or fixed borders. Then the term ‘nation’ 
meant something very different and non-political, 
generally referring simply to people born in the same 
locality. Furthermore, the different levels of overlap-
ping sovereignty typically constituted nested hierar-
chies, for example parish, bishopric, archbishopric 
for spiritual matters; manor, lordship, barony, duchy, 
kingdom for secular matters. People were members

1996). Through the twentieth century, the ideology of 
nationalism (and the associated idea of nation-states) 
became one of the dominant and most widespread influ-
ences on politics across the world, arguably becoming a 
key (or the key) manifestation of modern territoriality.
Occasionally nationalisms recognize that the state 
itself may be multinational (as in British nationalism, 
which contains English, Scottish, Welsh, northern Irish 
protestant and catholic, and other affiliations due to gen-
erations of migrants and mixed religious, ethnic groups 
over time becoming part of the United Kingdom), but in 
so doing, the wish is usually expressed that somehow a 
more inclusive national identity will evolve or has evolved 
which coincides with the boundaries of the state. Britain, 
China, Switzerland, South Africa, Nigeria and the United 
States of America are all cases where different versions 
of the claim and goal of an inclusive ‘national identity’ 
that supposedly unites disparate ‘sub-nations’ or com-
munities have been asserted. All have been challenged 
and contested, sometimes peacefully through political 
process (referenda, debate and elections), but often vio-
lently by those who would wish to secede, eliciting rounds 
of repression and violent response. Often, the assertion 
of a particular dominant nationalism in a territory has 
required the suppression of or conflict with other national 
claims on the same territory (the emergence of the state 
of Israel is a clear example of this; and in turn the pro-
ject of a national home for Jewish people in the land of 
Palestine is in part a reaction to the genocidal extremes 
associated with German and other European national-
isms earlier in the twentieth century). As a result many 
‘national’ communities that assert a claim to statehood 
have been denied this (see Case study 22.1, for example). 
Others remain contested. Myanmar, for example, has wit-
nessed over five decades of protracted ethno-nationalist 
struggles, particularly between successive military regimes 
holding power in the predominantly ethnic-Burman heart-
lands, and various movements in the provinces that are 
seeking either greater political autonomy within a federal 
structure or complete independence. Indeed, for many 
years, large tracts of northern and eastern Myanmar are 
patched together by a series of fragile ceasefires and nat-
ural resource joint ventures between the ruling military 
junta and various ethno-political parties, companies and 
warlords. Specific armed political groups, such as the Wa 
United State Party, have effective authority over sections 
of the Burma–China and Burma–Lao border areas, which 
provide examples of de facto territorial power by ‘shadow 
state’ organizations (Grundy-Warr and Dean 2011). Thus, 
the political-legal integrity of ‘the Union of Myanmar’ has 
been contentious. Following the Myanmar national elec-
tions in November 2015, in which the National League for 
Democracy (NLD) party led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi 
security. Mandalas would expand and contract in 
concertina-like fashion. Each one contained several 
tributary rulers, some of whom would repudiate their 
vassal status when the opportunity arose and try to 
build up their own networks of vassals.
Territories of pre-modern kingdoms were often dis-
continuous, with outer tributaries and chiefdoms often 
paying tribute to more than one authority at the same 
time, and with areas of sovereign ambiguity, particu-
larly in heavily forested zones, high mountain areas, 
and remote regions. In a sense, the vast mountain ‘fron-
tiers’ of the mainland South-east Asian massif, South-
west China, Himalaya, and Afghanistan, have variously 
retained certain ‘frontier’ ‘resistance’ and ‘refuge’ char-
acteristics well into the era of modern nation-states (refer 
to Case study 22.2).
This system of tributary relationships carried its own 
forms of obligations, sanctions and allegiance. Manda-
las created complex geographies of power, ‘a polycentric 
landscape-seascape’ (Friend 2003: 18), including smaller 
chiefdoms paying tribute to more than one ‘overlord’ at 
the same time. Initially, the multiple sovereignties of the 
region were very confusing to the European imperial pow-
ers in the region who were eagerly trying to carve out their 
own spheres of unambiguous control. As Theodore Friend 
(2003: 21) notes in relation to the making of Indonesia:
The Netherlands required centuries to unify Indonesia 
in their own fashion: first for mercantilist advance-
ment of trade and then for nineteenth-century motives 
of geographic empire . . . How could so few succeed 
over so many? The answer: because only a handful of 
mandalas had to be overcome, each caring little about 
the others or knowing nothing of them. The Dutch 
brought a layer of assiduous modernity to political 
vacuums strung throughout a vast archipelago. Geo-
graphically disconnected and culturally discordant but 
now administratively centralized, the Netherlands East 
Indies was for the length of one human generation the 
first comprehensive empire that region had ever known.
Although significant vestiges of such territorial struc-
tures remain, today they have mostly been displaced by 
nation-states with fixed (though sometimes disputed) 
boundaries. Sometimes the new geography was imposed 
by the colonial powers, but indigenous polities were also 
active in transforming the political map, such as China’s 
long quest to have political control over numerous stub-
born non-Han ethnic polities in the vast south-western 
frontier (Giersch 2001), and in Siam in the late nineteenth 
century, where the Siamese Court began to employ ‘mod-
ern’ political cartography backed up by military power to 
determine the sovereign limits of the kingdom (Winichakul

being probably the only community of over 15 mil-
lion persons which has not achieved some form of 
national statehood, despite a struggle extending 
back several decades’. The lands predominantly 
inhabited by Kurds came to be divided between 
four states (see Figure 22.1): Iran, Iraq, Turkey and 
Syria (there are also smaller Kurdish communities in 
the former Soviet Union – Armenia, Azerbaijan and 
Georgia – and significant Kurdish diaspora popula-
tions in Europe, especially in Austria, Germany and 
Scandinavia).

444    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
national identities within a multinational state (such as 
Scotland in the United Kingdom or Quebec in Canada) 
become the basis for claims that they should enjoy full state-
hood. In many cases too, either the central state or some 
other community with another affiliation resists. There 
are numerous examples of this, including the complex 
case of Northern Ireland, where most Catholics (Repub-
licans) would wish to see the province united with the rest 
of the Irish Republic (which itself successfully broke away 
from the British colonial empire earlier in the twentieth 
century). Most Protestants (Unionists), who claim descent 
from settler populations from England and Scotland, wish 
to remain part of a ‘United Kingdom’ (see Case study 21.4).
The Irish case is just one of dozens of situations 
where conflicting nationalist and confessional (religious-
cultural) logics collide, often with violent consequences. 
There is clearly something very powerful going on, 
whereby nationalist visions are linked with particular ter-
ritories and conceptions of state. Yet, as Anderson (1983: 
3) recognizes:
But if the facts [of the existence of many and some-
times conflicting nationalisms] are clear, their expla-
nation remains a matter of long-standing dispute. 
Nation, nationality, nationalism – all have proved 
notoriously difficult to define, let alone analyse. In 
contrast to the immense influence that nationalism 
has exerted on the modern world, plausible theory 
about it is conspicuously meagre. Hugh Seton-Wat-
son, author of by far the best and most comprehen-
sive English-language text on nationalism, and heir 
to a vast tradition of liberal historiography [theories 
of history writing] and social science, sadly observes: 
‘Thus I am driven to the conclusion that no “scientific 
definition has existed and exists”.’
Readers may wish to ‘prove’ Seton-Watson’s observa-
tion for themselves, by trying to come up with a univer-
sally valid definition of a nation. Faced with this task, 
won a decisive majority, thus replacing effective military 
rule since 1962 with a fledgling democracy, there are likely 
to be peaceful changes to the political landscape, although 
key ethnic parties and ethnic armed organizations still 
prefer a federal nation-state to a union where politics 
is dominated by the ethnic Burman or Bamar majority 
population. Globally, there a numerous other examples 
of de facto states (Pegg 1998; Bacheli et al. 2004), such as 
Somaliland (Srebrnik 2004), Abkhazia (O Loughlin et al. 
2011) and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (Nav-
aro-Yashin 2005, 2012), as well as bi- or ‘multinational’ 
territories, such as Bosnia-Herzegovina (Dahlman and Ó 
Tuathail 2005; Ó Tuathail and Dahlman 2006). Such cases 
reveal the truly complex nature of the historical, cultural 
and political geographies that complicate and sometimes 
contradict territorial nation-statehood.
Two ‘multinational’ communist countries, namely 
Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, sought to regulate 
nationalism by assigning citizens to one of a number of 
constituent national identities. This sometimes involved 
inventing nationalities to rationalize and simplify more 
complex tribal and religious identities, whilst asserting 
that these should be subservient to an overarching sense 
of Soviet or Yugoslav identity which coincided with the 
boundaries of the USSR or of Yugoslavia. So, for exam-
ple, in the USSR, people could be declared on their iden-
tity documents as having one of a number of officially 
recognized nationalities (Uzbek, Latvian or Russian, for 
example), but they would also and supposedly above all 
be citizens of the USSR. In due course, it was in part 
because of local nationalist challenges to wider Soviet 
and Yugoslav affiliations that the USSR and Yugoslavia 
collapsed in the early 1990s.
Many of those self-identified nations without their own 
state (the Kurds are an example, see Case study 22.1; as 
are Palestinians, Basques, Karen and Tibetans, to name a 
few) claim either the right to one or at least a high level of 
self-rule or autonomy. And frequently, smaller recognized 
➜
Yet frequent attempts on the part of the states in the 
region to eradicate Kurdish identity and nationalism were 
not able to quash either the widespread sense of Kurd-
ishness or the often violent struggle in pursuit of a Kurd-
ish nation-state. After years of struggle, which became 
interconnected with the Cold War, regional rivalries and 
then the American-led wars with Iraq in 1991 and 2003, 
the northern part of Iraq – which is predominantly Kurd-
ish – is now an autonomous region. Since 2013, autono-
mous Kurdish cantons have also emerged in northern 
Syria, in the wake of the wider civil war there whilst the 
allied Kurdish nationalist movement that had hitherto 
sought a state in the eastern part of Turkey now officially 
seeks a democratic con-federal settlement. The future 
status of these territories and relationships between 
them and their neighbours (which include the insurgent 
‘Islamic State’ in Iraq and Syria that was established in 
2014, the Turkish state, which will be a century old in 
1923, Iran and the weakened central governments in 
Iraq and Syria) remain uncertain and pose challenges 
to established concepts of nationhood, sovereignty and 
territory (Paasche and Sidaway 2015).

Case study 22.2 
Zomia: highland resistance to nation-
building and state-making
The map refers to a vast mountainous region of approxi-
mately 2.5 million square kilometres, spanning the 
boundaries of ten recognized nation-states, and sprawl-
ing across the designated ‘world regional area’ limits of 
‘South Asia’, ‘Central Asia’, ‘East Asia’ and mainland 
‘South-east Asia’ (Figure 22.2). This transnational high-
land zone is called ‘Zomia’ (based on a Tibeto-Burman 
term ‘zomi’), a term invented and proposed by historian 
Willem van Schendel (2005: 284–5), who argues that 
‘much of Zomia resisted the projects of nation-building 
and state-making of the countries to which it belonged’. 
Part of the reason for this are the great many dispersed 
‘national minority’ groupings, such as Naga, Akha, Lahu, 
Hmong, Lisu, Shan and Kachin, as well as numerous 
other groups, each with their own peculiar socio-ecolog-
ical adaptations to highland life, and cultural, linguistic 
and religious affinities that are distinct from dominant 
‘national’ languages and religions. Similar communities 
(the four towns indicated on the map) – just a short dis-
tance apart – fall into four states and macro-regions.
James C. Scott (2009) has produced an ‘anar-
chist history of upland Southeast Asia’, revealing the 
connected but often antagonistic co-evolution of hill 
and valley across much of Zomia. He argues that 
‘Zomia coheres as a region not by political unity, which 
it utterly lacks, but by comparable patterns of diverse 
agriculture, dispersal, mobility and egalitarianism’ (Scott 
2008: 12). Scott (2009) reveals that, over long periods 
of time, many groups of people viewed the uplands as 
economic, cultural and political ‘refuges’ from interfering 
and hierarchical lowland state authorities. Thus, histori-
cally, many people migrated to these areas in order 
to escape, evade or resist state interference. These 
spaces of state ‘evasion’, ‘resistance’ and ‘refuge’ were 
ultimately partitioned into various national geo-bodies 
following the nineteenth and early twentieth century 
rivalries and boundary-making activities of imperial 
powers, and the adoption of modern political geogra-
phy by dominant indigenous polities, and subsequent 
post-colonial nationalist elites (Winichakul 1996).
The arbitrary and abrupt nature of geopolitical 
boundaries generated tensions between central states 
and the upland groups, who have frequently been 
regarded as suspicious, backward, primitive and unco-
operative ‘minorities’, and, occasionally, as security 
threats by lowland state authorities (van Schendel 
2005; Michaud 2009; Scott 2009). In the modern

446    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. 
Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, 
over the past two centuries, for so many millions of 
people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such 
limited imaginings.
Within all this is a profound territorial link between 
the nation and the state. The state claims to be a sov-
ereign expression of the nation – bound to it and to a 
particular place. That is, it has territorial limits. The 
nation-state has a geography, which is charted, demar-
cated, mapped and represented to the ‘national popula-
tion’ in their school atlases and geography lessons. Such a 
system of ‘national’ geographical representation is always 
combined with an historical vision, a grand narrative 
of ‘national history’, often assuming that the nation is 
ancient, even primeval.
Yet Anderson and other critical accounts of national-
ism stress that it is very much a modern ideology. For what 
makes mass nationalism possible are certain socio-eco-
nomic and technical transformations, notably the arrival 
of media and national educational systems. Schooling, 
newspapers, and later radio and television all help to 
promote and popularize the idea that people belong to 
and share in the nation. Whilst others have emphasized 
the longer historical roots of many nationalisms in pre-
modern ethnic affiliations (for example, Smith 1988), 
for Anderson and most other critical observers, what is 
striking is nationalism’s relative modernity. Even where 
nationalists imagine the nation as ancient, such an imagi-
nation is itself more often than not predominantly a nine-
teenth- and twentieth-century phenomenon. At a pinch, 
nationalism might be traced to the seventeenth century. 
But the ideology of the nation-state was not anywhere 
very evident before then. So whilst someone might talk 
about a thousand years (or more) of, for example, Eng-
lish or British, Korean or Indian national history, they 
students will often work through a long list of character-
istics ascribed to nationality. But it seems that exceptions 
can always be found. Language is a favoured criterion, 
but then many languages are spoken by more than one 
‘nation’ (English is an example) and some ‘nation-states’ 
(Switzerland, Belgium or Mozambique, for example) 
contain substantial communities speaking different lan-
guages. Religion is sometimes chosen, but the same objec-
tions apply. Ethnicity and ‘race’ turn out to be problematic 
criteria, favoured by racists of all stripes, and often part 
of the basis for national identities, but susceptible to the 
obvious and undeniable point that everywhere is much too 
mixed up historically and genetically for such categoriza-
tions to be watertight. Besides, some nationalisms have 
come to celebrate their multiracial and multicultural com-
position, as in the ‘melting pot’ United States or the ‘rain-
bow nation’ of South Africa. ‘Culture’ usually crops up as 
a criterion. Yet (as Chapter 13 has indicated), cultures are 
always (though of course to varying degrees) heterogene-
ous and contested. Think, for example, of age, gender, 
class and other variations and the coexistence of multi-
ple sub-cultures and identities (which, as Chapter 21 has 
shown, are often related to distinctive ‘local’ territoriali-
ties) that characterize every supposedly ‘national society’.
All this leads Anderson to declare that nations are in 
a sense ‘imagined communities’. This imaginary status 
is not to deny that they are not in a sense real to those 
who feel they belong to them. Indeed, Anderson (1983: 
6–7) feels that:
In fact, all communities larger than primordial villages 
of face-to-face contact (and perhaps even those) are 
imagined. Communities are to be distinguished, not 
by their falsity/genuineness, but by the style in which 
they are imagined . . . Finally, it is imagined as com-
munity, because regardless of the actual inequality 
and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation 
history of these nation-states, Zomia has been char-
acterized by ‘a high incidence of regionalist and sepa-
ratist movements, “non-state spaces”, and discursive 
battles around concepts such as “tribe” and “indigenous 
people”’ (van Schendel 2005: 285). Central territorial 
states have sought to extend administrative control 
into the uplands of Zomia through various ‘develop-
ment projects’, forced resettlement of highland groups, 
campaigns aimed to extend settled farming into higher 
lands, religious conversions, spatial extensions of 
central bureaucratic administration and infrastructure 
such as roads, making these ‘spaces of evasion’ more 
accessible over time.
‘Zomia’ is part of a new conceptual map proposed 
by scholars to address relative academic neglect in 
‘area imagination’, which helps us to break free of our 
rigid national geographic imaginaries, particularly with 
regard to the histories, ethnographies and geographies 
of mobile groups (Ludden 2003), the politics of place 
and belonging of so-called ‘minorities’ (Michaud 2010), 
and the complex interrelated, transitional and transient 
dimensions of borderscapes (Rajaram and Grundy-
Warr 2007). We need to be critical of reifying ‘national 
geo-bodies’ and pay attention to myriad pre-existing 
and contemporary transnational social and political for-
mations that challenge the map of nation-states.

Chapter 22  The place of the nation-state    447
century, which, considering the repeated political and 
cultural realignments within the space we now label 
‘Thailand’, seems only a little more bizarre than its 
neighbour on the shelf, a history of the Soviet Union 
from palaeolithic times to World War II.
There has been a strong tendency to see nations and 
nationalisms as essentially being derived from American 
and European prototypes. It is important to challenge 
the idea that nationhood is a nationalist project originat-
ing in the West that was simply implanted onto the rest 
of the world without significant transformations in the 
various cultural, ethnic and religious contexts it touched. 
African, Middle Eastern or Asian variants of nationalism 
or constructions of statehood are far more than simply 
colourful (or failed) replicas of the European–American 
model(s). To be sure, imported idioms and motifs from 
Europe and America have been important; for example, 
the official state language in a fair number of former 
colonies is that of the old colonial power. And European 
(and less often United States) imperialism has provided 
an important backdrop to the trajectory of nationalisms 
in Africa and Asia, not least because the anti-colonial 
nationalists themselves were often educated in Western 
institutions and adopted concepts such as self-determi-
nation, national liberation and territorial sovereignty 
in their political struggles against the colonial powers. 
Yet whilst ‘globalizing’ capitalism and especially impe-
rialism are part of the picture, African, Middle Eastern 
and Asian nationalisms are also (like those of Europe 
and the Americas) rooted in local historical trajectories. 
In many cases these are of much longer vintage, often 
based on sophisticated cultural, religious and ethnic tap-
estries, some of the main patterns of which have subse-
quently been appropriated or (re)invented as pre-colonial 
‘national’ histories.
Thus, we should perhaps think in terms of multiple 
histories and geographies of nations and states, and 
not just of particular European or American modular 
forms. The influential Bengali intellectual Partha Chat-
terjee (1993) has persuasively argued against the imagin-
ing of Indian national identity through the lens of the 
colonial power and stresses the ‘essential’ inner or spir-
itual domains of culture that were never colonized, never 
European. Furthermore, there are different coexisting 
national voices or ‘fragments’ – among women, peasants, 
elite, castes, outcasts, and so on – each with its separate 
discourse. As Stein Tønnesson and Hans Antlöv (1996: 
32) put it:
When the national idea entered Asia it could not be 
implemented without mediation, hence transforma-
tion, by indigenous agencies in particular settings. 
There were existing and alternative ideas with which 
conveniently forget that English or British, Korean and 
Indian nationalisms are relatively modern concepts, much 
less than a thousand years old.
The tendency for nationalists is to ‘reinvent the past’, to 
pick out selective moments from the past, or to manipulate 
history (Hobsbawm 1996), whether this is in banal ways 
through the national curriculum of schools or through 
deliberate propaganda to mobilize the masses. Whilst his-
tory is undoubtedly significant, the nationalist brew would 
be incomplete without ancestral connections to ‘home-
land’ and to particular places. In other words, territory 
is central to nationalism, and this is often why whenever 
there are divergent nationalist claims to one piece of land, 
extreme violence often follows. Indeed, the terrible forms 
of so-called ‘ethnic cleansing’ witnessed in the former 
Yugoslavia in the 1990s are illustrations of recent nation-
alist extremism and the significance of historical imagina-
tions concerning territorial-political and cultural identity.
Nationalist narratives and claims are not always linked 
to such violent actions. At times they may be rather more 
rhetorical or theatrical. Graham E. Clarke (1996: 231–2) 
raises a particular Nepalese example:
[I]n the 1960s in Kathmandu the sole national newspa-
per carried articles, no doubt read tongue in cheek by 
some educated Nepalese, arguing that since Lumbini, 
the birthplace of the historical Buddha (Gautama), 
was located some few five miles north of the current 
southern border, that Buddha was therefore Nepalese 
and not Indian.
All of this relates to the important issue of how we 
deal with things like space and identity in history. As 
Morris-Suzuki (1996: 42) writes:
The nation . . . casts a long shadow backwards on our 
vision of the past, and channels our perceptions into a 
particular spatial framework. In my bookcase, I have 
a volume on the history of Thailand since the tenth

inferior to men, or as requiring the protection of natu-
rally more powerful men, frequently provided the prior 
backdrop to depicting hierarchies (between dominating 
and dominated classes, for example) within the nation as 
natural, like those of a family. A similar conception pro-
vided part of the racist justification for overseas colonies. 
Peoples subject to colonial domination were often repre-
sented in such racist terms as being equivalent to ‘families’ 
of black ‘children’ ruled by a ‘benevolent’ white father.
22.3 Constructing boundaries: 
upwards and outwards
States come in diverse shapes and sizes. But they all have 
boundaries (which, if they have a coastline, also extend 
into the sea and are governed by international protocols: 
see Stienberg 2001). The extract from Winichakul (1996) 
quoted at the start of this chapter noted how the ‘ter-
ritoriality’ of the modern nation-state is of a bounded 
space: ‘a certain portion of the earth’s surface which 
can be easily identified’. Pre-modern dynastic realms 
and empires could make do with loose boundaries. But 
modern nation-states have felt it necessary to demarcate 
their boundaries, to iron out perceived irrationalities and 
anomalies, sometimes by going to war. In short, they have 
sought to nationalize and unify ‘their’ space and ‘their’ 
(national) populations and render them into known, sur-
veyed and defensible sovereign territory and communi-
ties. They also seek to order and frame ‘nature’. In The 
Nature of the State, Whitehead et al. (2007) examine why 
a two-dimensional view of states is problematic, through 
foregrounding state-nature relations. A number of key 
issues emerge from ‘excavating the political ecologies 
of the modern state’ (the subtitle to their book). They 
cite the way that the Netherlands emerged as a nation-
state through a dual process of building a global empire 
(extending to the Americas and South-east Asia) and 
reclaiming land from the sea as an example of how the 
regulation of nature is folded into a nation-state project. 
But similar examples can be found elsewhere in both 
pre-modern and contemporary states. Elden (2013: 49) 
likewise points to the significance of ‘the political tech-
nology of territory’ with its associated ‘biometrics and 
geo-metrics’ used to ‘secure the volume’ in terms of both 
state security as well as environmental resource exploita-
tion. In other words, state territory extends upwards into 
airspace and downwards into geological resources. For 
example, Biggs (2010) examines how successive states in 
Vietnam (pre-colonial, French colonial, national, regional 
and superpowers, such as the US during the Vietnam 
European-style nationalism interacted and inter-
mixed . . . the nationalist ideas were invested with 
local qualities, meanings and nuances which could 
not be found in Europe. People had their own views 
on what constituted a legitimate social order, and such 
views could not be ignored by the modernizing leaders 
of the anti-colonial struggles.
As well as different cultural ‘forms of the nation’, 
we may also consider different gendered perspectives of 
nationalism and nation-states. Although Chatterjee’s 
(1993) arguments are quite specific to the South Asian 
case, they do reveal the coexistence of different voices, 
men and women, and this relates to the point about 
nationalism and constructions of nation-statehood 
invoking different conceptions of ‘manhood’ and ‘wom-
anhood’ more widely. Although there are immense histor-
ical and geographical variations of this, there is a general 
tendency for women to be seen as particularly important 
transmitters of ‘national culture’ (for example, in the idea 
of a ‘mother-tongue’ language) (Yuval-Davis 1997) and 
as somehow the embodiment of the nation. McClintock 
(1994: 352) thus notes that:
Nations are contested systems of cultural represen-
tation that limit and legitimize people’s access to 
the resources of the nation-state, but despite many 
nationalists’ ideological investment in the idea of 
popular unity, nations have historically amounted 
to the sanctioned institutionalization of gender dif-
ference. No nation in the world grants women and 
men the same access to the rights and resources of 
the nation-state.
Moreover, particular ideas of the ‘family’ are central 
to most imagined communities:
Nations are frequently figured through the iconogra-
phy of familial and domestic space. The term nation 
derives from [the Latin] natio: to be born. We speak of 
nations as ‘motherlands’ and ‘fatherlands’. Foreigners 
‘adopt’ countries that are not their native homes and 
are naturalized into the national ‘family’. We talk of 
the ‘Family of Nations’, of ‘homelands’ and ‘native’ 
lands. In Britain, immigration matters are dealt with 
at the Home Office; in the United States, the president 
and his wife are called the First Family. Winnie Man-
dela was, until her recent fall from grace, honoured 
as South Africa’s ‘Mother of the Nation’. In this way, 
despite their myriad differences, nations are symboli-
cally figured as domestic genealogies.
In several European nationalisms (including ‘British’) 
one significance of this is that the sexist notion of women 
(usually grouped with children) supposedly as naturally

many wars, homicides and excesses, as a conse-
quence of which the lands of both [kingdoms] have 
been looted, burnt and ruined, weighing heavily on 
God . . . [and] because of our sins, risking the danger 
of losing them and them falling into the hands of our 
enemies in the faith and most gravely [causing] the 
violation of God’s will and injury to the holy church 
of Rome and Christendom.
(Cited in Martíñez 1997: 15; our translation)
Moreover, the actual demarcation of the Portuguese–
Spanish borderline had to wait until the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries. Two formal delimitation treaties set 
out an agreed frontier and established mechanisms for 
its physical demarcation on the ground. But gone are 
‘amens’ and references to ‘the will of God’. Instead, the 
treaties (the first of 1864 for the northern half of the bor-
der and the second of 1926 for the southern half of the 
border) make reference to the need to impose order and 
well-defined demarcations, to ‘eliminate the anomalous 
situation in which, in the shadow of ancient feudal tradi-
tions’ (Tratado de Limites 1866: 1; our translation), some 
frontier areas (including a number of villages) were rec-
ognized as shared or common lands with usage rights by 
communities of both states/‘nationalities’. Following the 
treaties, such areas were divided and the border, where 
not demarcated by a river, was marked on the ground by 
rectangular boundary stones every few hundred metres 
(although it took a couple of decades to put in place all 
the boundary markers and resolve local conflicts and dif-
ferences over the ‘fine-scale’ division of lands). In other 
words, the Portuguese-Spanish case indicates how the 
epoch of modern nationalism (i.e. the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries) saw what James Anderson (1995: 
71) called:
a territorialisation of politics, with a sharpening of 
differences at the borders of states and of nations 
between ‘internal’ and ‘external’, ‘belonging’ and ‘not 
belonging’, ‘us’ and ‘them’.
By the same logic, or an extreme extension of it, 
minorities who do not ‘fit in’ sometimes have to be moved, 
murdered or deported – or, in the euphemisms of our 
times, ‘cleansed’ (see Sibley 1995). This has been associ-
ated with, for example, Nazi racial territorial visions of 
a Europe cleansed of Jews and Gypsies and an expanded 
racially pure Germany. The Nazi Holocaust represents an 
extreme case. But ‘cleansing’ or ‘purification’ of national 
space, amounting to the expulsion or murder of people 
defined as ‘foreign’ or ‘alien’, has been widespread in 
the twentieth century. There are examples from all con-
tinents: the creation of modern Turkey whose Armenian 
War) have tried to extend their territorial, political and 
economic power over the ‘fluid, volatile environment’ of 
the Mekong delta. What he reveals is that nation-nature 
are constantly in some sort of flux, and that with every 
effort to contain, harness and transform nature, there 
are many ways in which the ‘serpentine force’ of the 
Cuu Long (Nine Dragons, the Vietnamese name for the 
Delta) is never entirely under full state control. Sea-level 
change, salt water intrusion, flooding, and siltation are all 
processes of change that require actions that make state-
nature relations central to the logic of the nation-states, 
but also exceed their capacity and power.
The rise of geopolitics in the late nineteenth and early 
twentieth centuries represented a particular expression 
of these state-territorial rationalities (as Chapter 20 
explored), with lots of ideas about nature folded into 
the arguments, but state rationalities have wider forms 
and deeper roots. The nineteenth-century invention and 
refinement of statistics (state-istics = the science of the 
state) and demography (demos = people, graphy = writ-
ing) and the establishment of geography (geo = earth, 
graphy = writing) as a university discipline and field of 
research are all part of this regime of knowledge and 
power where people are surveyed and made into subjects 
of nation-states. For states with land boundaries the 
occupation and official demarcation of the frontiers is 
an important part of this process.
Consider the example of the border that is often recog-
nized as the oldest, more or less stable, still-existing bor-
der in the world, that between Spain and Portugal. The 
mutual recognition of the border between Spain and Por-
tugal is usually traced in modern Spanish and (particu-
larly) Portuguese history to the Treaty of Alcañices signed 
on 12 September 1297 (in fact, the date on the Treaty is 12 
September 1335, but amongst other things, our conven-
tions for counting years have altered since). The Treaty 
has acquired something of the status of a foundational 
text. In other words, it is interpreted as a kind of proof 
of the ancient historical basis of the nations concerned.
Yet the treaty was not signed in the name of states or 
‘nations’. Named after the Templar castle in which it was 
sealed and witnessed, the text of the treaty of Alcañices 
begins with the words ‘In the name of God. amen.’ and 
is signed in the presence of the Templars and other holy 
orders by those who describe themselves as:
by the grace of God the King of Portugal and the 
Algarve and by the grace of God the King of Castille 
and Leon, 
and has as its subject:
towns, castles and lands, town boundaries, divisions 
and orderings . . . [disputes over which] have caused 

450    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
bureaucratic actions are its most commonplace ritu-
als. There are other such everyday rituals: Hegel saw 
the reading of the morning newspaper as the secular 
replacement of prayer.
There are indeed many public rituals of nationality 
and statehood: coronations and remembrance days, mili-
tary parades, national holidays, national prowess (or the 
lack of it) at football or the Olympics, swearing in of gov-
ernments, state funerals. (Football in the United Kingdom 
is also revealing of the complexity of British nationalisms, 
and the existence of separate Scottish, English, Welsh and 
Northern Irish squads is a testimony to the limits to ‘Brit-
ishness’ and the endurance or ‘revival’ of other national 
affiliations.) In all these rituals, the nation is reaffirmed 
and the state performed and made to seem omnipresent, 
historical and real. Dramatic cultural or political events 
(as well as notable national sporting occasions, such as 
soccer World Cup or Olympic successes) covered by the 
media reinforce senses of national community. The events 
population were slaughtered in the second decade of the 
twentieth century (and which still has not resolved the 
status of its Kurdish minority); the creation of Israel in 
the 1940s, which was accompanied by the flight of indig-
enous Palestinian Arabs from territories deemed part of 
the new Jewish national state; the system of reservations 
for native Americans in the USA and Canada; the vio-
lent exchange of Muslim, Hindu and Sikh populations 
which accompanied the 1947 partition of India; the 1974 
partition of Cyprus; the wars of the 1990s in the for-
mer Yugoslavia (see Case study 21.2); and the partition 
of Ireland. These logics have also produced calls for the 
modification of boundaries, sometimes resulting in vio-
lence and war. No continent has been without examples 
of such conflict and violence and it is probably impossible 
to find a state which has not at some time expelled people 
or murdered them in the name of some nation or other. 
Yet each nationalism must also be unique, establishing 
itself as different from others (even if the apparatuses of 
flags and anthems are superficially similar), constructing 
a sense of self against others who are defined as outside 
the imagined community. We will return to borders and 
borderlands in Section 22.5.
22.4 Nation-states as symbolic 
systems
As we have seen, the state is the bureaucratic expression 
of nationalism. This is not to say that a widespread sense 
of nationalism inevitably precedes the state. Indeed, what 
is often termed the state apparatus (everything from regu-
lations governing schools, to tax inspectors and politi-
cians) seeks to foster national subjectivities out of the 
frequently ambivalent and disparate array of identities 
contained by its boundaries. If, as has been argued by 
many, nationalism is akin to religion, then the state 
becomes its symbolic structure. When examining the 
superficially quite different cases of Australia and Sri 
Lanka, Bruce Kapferer (1988) claims that nationalism is 
itself a religion, owing to the fact that, as with most reli-
gious-like beliefs, nationalism demands the recognition 
(his word is ‘reification’, which means something more 
than this) of an all-encompassing entity (the nation). The 
nation fulfils the role of a sacred cause, something greater 
than any individual and something which may be worth 
dying for. The nation is the God or deity of the religion 
of nationalism and the state is its theology or temple. 
Moreover, as Herzfeld (1992: 37) notes:
Every bureaucratic action affirms the theology of the 
state. Just as nationalism can be viewed as religion,

state’: boundary patrols.

Chapter 22  The place of the nation-state    451
competing authority structures take over. For instance, 
Helander wrote about the complex power situations in 
Somalia affecting every single aspect of daily life, where 
‘any opinion expressed or action performed must always 
be positioned in the political landscape’ of rival clans, 
warlords, and issues of ethnic, religious and cultural iden-
tity. In the contexts of atomistic and antagonistic power 
struggles we need to appreciate the local power configu-
rations that enable communities to continue with every-
day life in the absence of a meaningful state apparatus. 
Helander was critical of international organizations that 
tend to act too rashly in countries such as Somalia, often 
distributing massive sums of inappropriate aid according 
to the ‘shifting agendas of foreign donors’ and frequently 
without great familiarity with the nuances of the ‘local’ 
human, cultural and political landscape. Such perspec-
tives would clearly be even more applicable in situations 
of failed international interventions creating uncertain 
and extremely dangerous regime changes, unpopular 
occupations, and an almost complete absence of any 
form of security for large segments of the population. 
This happened in parts of Iraq after the US-led invasion 
to depose the government of Saddam Hussein in 2003 
and in Libya following uprising against Kaddafi and 
Western-led intervention to enable his overthrow in 2011. 
Arguably this was also the situation in Afghanistan in the 
1980s, after the Soviet Union invaded to prop up a com-
munist government in the capital city who faced rebellion 
in the more conservative countryside. Afghanistan then 
became a focus of Cold War geopolitical conflict (as was 
detailed in Chapter 20), laying the basis for many more 
years of confrontation, subsequent interventions (by the 
United States and its allies) and enduring state failure. In 
such situations, we may actually have to ask, ‘What kind 
of State? Where and who are the authorities?’
of 11 September 2001 were thus narrated in the United 
States as an ‘attack on America’. It is also said, for exam-
ple, that virtually every adult American alive at the time 
can recall where they were on hearing the news of the 
assassination of US President John F. Kennedy in 1963. 
Whilst his funeral, like that of Diana Spencer in 1997, 
became a global media spectacle, it was represented and 
felt most acutely as a kind of national loss.
But the nation-state also demands (like all effective 
religions) personal commitment and more minor ritual-
istic acts, many of which rest on a geographical imagi-
nation of inside and outside, belonging and otherness 
(see Taussig 1997). The anthropologist Michael Herzfeld 
(1992: 109) examines this theme and is worth quoting at 
some length:
Nationalist ideologies are systems of classification. 
Most of them are very clear about what it takes to 
be an insider. That, at least, is the theory. In practice, 
however, divergent interpretations give the lie to such 
essentialist claims, as to take one prominent and cur-
rent example, in the debate currently waging in Israel 
about the definition of a Jew. Such taxonomic [nam-
ing] exercises . . . are central to the very existence of 
the nation-state. All other bureaucratic classifications 
are ultimately calibrated to the state’s ability to dis-
tinguish between insiders and outsiders. Thus . . . one 
can see in bureaucratic encounters a ritualistic enact-
ment of the fundamental principles upon which the 
very apparatus of state rests. Seen in these terms, 
arguments about the number on a lost driver’s license 
or an applicant’s entitlement to social security do not 
simply challenge or reinforce the power of particular 
functionaries of state. They rehearse the logic of the 
state itself.
Not only that, but the whole exercise of state power 
gets taken for granted as the natural order of things. Only 
when many of those activities which are ascribed to the 
state are no longer carried out (in situations of war, for 
example) or when a person finds themselves on the wrong 
side of a state-sanctioned category (the wrong side of 
the boundary, the wrong side of the law) is the power 
(a power over life and death and thousands of lesser 
things) and the universality of the symbolic order of ‘the 
state’ revealed. The state claims the monopoly over these 
things. And for others to exercise judgment and to punish 
or to kill is ‘to take the law into their own hands’. These 
things are reserved for the territorial state. But what if 
there is no state? Or as cultural anthropologist Bernhard 
Helander (2005: 193) asks: ‘Who needs a State?’ There 
are parts of the world where any semblance of effective

but revived subsequently in new forms. We should try 
to avoid overly dualistic perspectives of ‘trans-border’ or 
‘transnational’ flows, such as ‘domestic/foreign’, ‘internal/
external’, ‘legal/illegal’, because by doing so, we would 
be perceiving flows entirely from rigid state-centred 
and fixed territorial positions. Even if we just consider 
state practices such as the enormous efforts of the US 
federal authorities in trying to keep ‘illegal aliens’ ‘out’  
(Plate 22.3), there are many more countervailing actions 
at official, quasi-official, unofficial levels, trying to make 
sure that as many people ‘get in’ because of their enor-
mous contributions to economic sectors (Andreas 2000).
Why is such work of relevance to ideas about ‘nation’ 
and the ‘nation-state’? It is precisely the very everydayness 
of many cross-border interactions, movements and con-
nections that raises big questions about the impression of 
solidity of spatially fixed notions of nationhood. Despite 
attempts to police them (indirectly resulting in the death 
of thousands of migrants in the recent decade as they 
seek to cross those fortified land-frontiers or are smuggled 
across dangerous maritime ones), the southern border of 
the United States and the maritime and land frontiers of 
many southern and eastern member states of the Euro-
pean Union exhibit similar porosity. Migrations have 
also produced significant transnational social networks, 
for example amongst Hispanics in the United States or 
Maghrebis in Europe or British and other Europeans in 
the settler-colonies of Australia and New Zealand.
22.6 Conclusions: the place of the 
nation-state?
There have never been so many states as there are today. 
In the nineteenth century a wave of new states (coun-
tries such as Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia) emerged in 
22.5 Sovereigntyscapes: 
­‘shadows’, ­‘borderlands’ 
and ‘transnationalisms’
We have seen that the geographies of ‘nations’ and states 
do not always coincide (consider again the Kurdish case, 
described in Case study 22.1), and that national territo-
rial histories are insufficient to account for ethno-histories, 
transnational identities and human mobilities (as illustrated 
in Case study 22.2). Thus sovereignty is rarely without 
contradictions or challenges from other states, potential 
states and nations. But how else might we think about the 
challenges to sovereignty and the historical and geographi-
cal complexity of nations? One way might be to think of 
political landscapes as ‘soveriegntyscapes’ (Sidaway 2003; 
Sidaway et al. 2005) containing varieties of countervailing 
tendencies, fragmented state sovereignty, ambiguous forms 
of sovereign control, and situations (such as Somalia, as 
noted above) where state authority may have collapsed 
or been replaced by various contending de facto forms 
of authority. Even when we consider the state as strong 
and central, we may view sovereignty as being ‘graduated’, 
whereby, as Aiwha Ong (1999: 217) observed, ‘states make 
different subject populations, privileging one gender over 
the other, and in certain kinds of human skills, talents and 
ethnicities; it thus subjects different sectors of the popula-
tion to different regimes of valuation and control.’
A variation on the theme of ‘shadow networks’ is to 
consider myriad cross-border connections between peo-
ple that somehow circumvent or subvert state-centred 
rules and regulations. In some contexts, such as the Euro-
pean Union, cross-border links are actively fostered and 
promoted (along with a common market and internal 
freedom of capital and personal mobility) with the aim 
of fostering a supranational (beyond nation) community 
(Kramsch and Hooper 2004). In other cases (such as the 
USA–Mexican border) or places where there is large scale 
‘illegal’ movement of people and goods, state power is 
defied or subverted. In this regard, Abraham and van 
Schendel (2005) draw upon a critical distinction between 
what states define as ‘legal/illegal’ and what ordinary 
people perceive as ‘licit/illicit’. Thus many transnational 
movements of people, commodities and ideas are illegal 
because they defy the norms and rules of formal politi-
cal authority, but they are quite acceptable, ‘licit’, in the 
eyes of the participants in these transactions and flows. 
Here the authors were not so concerned with the flows 
associated with big syndicates, but with the many ‘micro-
processes’ and transactions that form ‘everyday transna-
tionality’ in borderland spaces (van Schendel 2005: 55). 
Such transactions may involve kinship and family net-
works that were partitioned by superimposed boundaries,

the Americas in revolt against Spanish and Portuguese 
empires. These American prototypes and the USA itself 
(which dates from 1776) provided an example to nation-
alists elsewhere in the colonial world. But it was not 
until the twentieth century that most of Africa and Asia 
could escape direct colonial domination. This frequently 
required violent ‘national-liberation’ struggles against 
entrenched resistance from the colonial powers and 
white settler populations and in due course, the United 
Nations became a key arbiter of such post-colonial pro-
jects. In the decades between about 1945 and 1975, doz-
ens of new ‘sovereign’ states emerged in place of the old 
colonial map. The end of the Cold War saw a fresh crop, 
as the Soviet Union was succeed by 15 recognized sov-
ereign states (and more that went unrecognized or are 
contested, such as Transnistria, along Moldova’s border 
with Ukraine) and there have been several secessions 
since, yielding some universally recognized new states 
(such as Eritrea and South Sudan or most of those that 
succeed Yugoslavia) as well as others that are not univer-
sally recognized, such as Kosovo and some that operate as 
de facto states without any formal international recogni-
tion (such as Somaliland).
Yet, for many years the demise or decline of the state 
has been discerned or predicted, and such claims have of 
late become even more common in discourses about ‘glo-
balization’. These usually argue that the growing scale 
and power of transnational flows, particularly of capi-
tal (but also of people, ideas and religious affiliations, 
technologies and so on) is subverting the capacity of the 
state and weakening national identities. The nation-state 
is often described as being ‘hollowed-out’ or ‘eroded’. In 
this view, the state no longer has the power to command, 
for example, the society and economy inside its bounda-
ries that was once attributed to it. And such a ‘hollowing 
out’ is sometimes seen to point the way to a post-national 
world (or some kind of shared global culture in which 
national cultures are replaced by a more hybrid, but com-
mon global mixture).
Yuval-Davis (1997, reprinted in Brenner et al. 
2003: 322) pointed to the lack of congruence between 
nations and states, arguing that there is often a lack 
of ‘overlap between the boundaries of state citizens 
and “the nation”’, which requires us to have a much 
more ‘multi-layered’ notion of people’s citizenship 
needs, ‘because people’s membership in communities 
and polities is dynamic and multiple’. And, as we have 
seen, in recent years, the sovereignty of many states has 
also been questioned through imperial ‘interventions’ 
in the name of humanitarian intervention or the ‘war 
on terror’.
Others object that transnational forces of ‘globali-
zation’ are really nothing new and that capitalism in 
particular has shown itself to be able to coexist with 
states and nations and in symbiotic relationship with 
them. In other words, they reinforce each other. Moreo-
ver, ‘globalization’ is not only massively uneven (as we 
have seen in earlier chapters) but as likely to produce local 
backlashes as a universal culture of, say, the same fast 
food, drinks and soap operas and political orientations 
everywhere in the world. That is, the technologies of capi-
talism (particularly media) provide the preconditions for 
strengthening, rather than undermining, imagined com-
munities of nationalism, while states still act to fine-tune 
the regulatory frameworks for continued capital accu-
mulation (resorting where needed to force to suppress 
opposition). States still enact laws about business, trade 
unions, property rights and so on. Everywhere, buying a 
property or land or setting up a legal business requires 
some kind of registration with the state. No amount of 
globalization has ended this. However, instead of further 
entering the large and complex debates about the impacts 
of ‘globalization’ on nations and states, let us return to 
the conception of the state as a symbolic system, and as 
a complex of representations. The historian-philosopher 
and activist Michael Foucault (1979: 29) (see too Spot-
light box 24.2) argued in one of his most famous essays 
that:
We all know the fascination which the love, or hor-
ror, of the state exercises today; we know how much 
attention is paid to the genesis of the state, its his-
tory, its advance, its power and abuses, etc. . . . But the 
state, no more probably today than at any other time 
in its history, does not have this unity, this individual-
ity, this rigorous functionality, nor, to speak frankly, 
this importance; maybe after all the state is no more 
than a composite reality and a mythicised abstraction, 
whose importance is a lot more limited than many of 
us think.
Hence, to recognize the state as, in part at least, a 
symbolic system is also to recognize that, as Rose and 
Miller (1992: 172) argue: ‘“the state” itself emerges as an 
historically variable linguistic device for conceptualizing 
and articulating ways of ruling’. In other words, things 
like the ‘nation’ and the ‘state’ are made real mainly in 
certain words, texts (including maps) and deeds, that is, 
in language and action. The nation-state is an histori-
cally specific way of governance that links land, nation, 
population and polity. Think again of the staging of 
those national sporting, political and cultural occasions, 
which bring the nation home, and the more mundane or 
bureaucratic acts of state, such as the display of maps in 
schools and public buildings or the action of showing a 
passport or filling in a form with your national (insur-
ance, social security, registration or identity) number. 

454    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
The political geographer Joe Painter (2006: 753) called 
this ‘prosaic stateness’, ‘the mundane practices through 
which something which we label “the state” becomes 
present in everyday life’. According to Painter (2006: 753) 
therefore:
Behind each of these registration numbers, licenses 
and certificates are yet more documents and records 
held in state archives tracking employment, earn-
ings, criminal convictions, academic performance, 
visits to doctors and hospitals, ownership of vehi-
cles and landed property and numerous other fea-
tures of individuals’ ‘private’ lives. If weighed down 
by anxieties about the scope of the state’s knowl-
edge of us, we repair to the local pub for a drink, 
we will find that the state decides when and where 
the pub can open, the possible sizes of our serving 
of beer, how much of its price goes in tax . . . how 
our drinks are labeled . . . hygiene required in the 
pub kitchen and the minimum wages paid to the 
staff.
He might have added that in many places states 
(including the USA during the 1920s’ ‘prohibition’ era) 
have outlawed the sale or production of alcohol alto-
gether and that all states seek (with varying degrees 
of coercion and persuasion and success) to regulate 
or proscribe the consumption of other intoxicants. In 
this, as in other aspects of their regulatory, ideological 
and coercive power, perhaps nation-states exist above 
all as systems of actions and beliefs – an ‘imagination’ 
if you like – which must be continually re-enacted, re-
narrated and re-imagined as territorial sovereign spaces 
in order to seem important and real to us. Just as they 
have been here. And as they will be should you go to 
a pub, or perhaps even to a café, classroom or canteen 
instead.

Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter, you should understand that:
● Nations, nationalism and states are complex histori-
cally and geographically variable phenomena.
● Nationalism is an ideology (a system of beliefs) 
which holds that people have a primary identity to a 
particular nation and that such communities should 
be able to express themselves in a geographically 
defined state.
● Nations can be understood as a kind of imagined 
community. They are imagined because not all 
members of a national community can know each 
other.
● Such national imaginaries contain a geography, a 
mental map of national space and its boundaries.
● Nation-states embody particular ways of governing 
population, nature, territory and economy: these 
modes of governance are variable in space and 
time (the role of the state has and continues to 
change) – and new modes and scales (such as the 
supranational project of the European Union) of 
governance have emerged.
● National imaginaries are also gendered, for exam-
ple in the idea of mothers as key transmitters of 
‘national culture’ to the next generation.
● States can be understood as complex symbolic 
systems.

deep-seated cultural and political practices interact with

Chapter 23  The geographies of citizenship    457
23.1 Introduction: citizenship and place
Citizenship matters. Without it you are unable to access 
easily many basic rights such as education or welfare ben-
efits. It is a precondition of being able to work and move 
legally within and between countries. Being a citizen may 
also foster a feeling of belonging or even a sense of duty 
and a desire to serve a wider community. Citizenship is 
also geographical; it is something that is only given mean-
ing when it is put in a spatial context. You are a citizen of 
a place, be it a formally recognized country or an informal 
community. You may also see yourself as a citizen of the 
world, keen to engage in international politics or actions 
aimed at tackling global issues such as climate change or 
unfair trade. At the same time, local places and sites pro-
vide a context for you to act as a citizen, be it through 
voting, writing to a councillor or simply taking part in 
many aspects of everyday life. This said, citizenship often 
operates in the background of life, subtle and unremark-
able until it is disturbed. Perhaps you only consider it when 
presenting a passport at a border control (Plate 23.1) or if 
your rights are threatened in some way. When this slumber-
ing giant is awoken, it can provoke protest, activism and 
even revolution. No wonder, therefore, that geographers 
are starting to take the idea more seriously and examine 
its social and political significance.
Citizenship traditionally referred to the relationship 
between an individual and a political unit. With this 
association comes an obligation for a person to fulfil 
particular duties and the state to assure certain rights. 
For example, in some states a citizen has an obligation 
to undertake national service, perhaps in the form of 
military duty. In turn, citizens have recourse to certain 
political, social and civic rights that are determined and 
enforced by national and international law.
Yet, these seemingly straightforward statements belie 
that citizenship is a contested idea (Spotlight box 23.1). 
It is far from a universally agreed concept and, instead, is 
continually being disputed, renegotiated and redefined. 
Take, for example, the citizenship tests that have been 
introduced by many countries to prescribe what would-be 
citizens should know about the daily life, history, politics 
and tradition of their adoptive state. The Australian test 
tends to focus on European and Aboriginal histories with 
little attention given to the significance of Asian influ-
ences on Australian daily life. In the UK politicians have 
debated the relative merits of including questions on the 
UK’s history over ones on current political-legal struc-
tures. And in any case, can a series of multiple-choice 
questions really get the essence of what it means to be a 
citizen? More often they advocate a particular view of cit-
izenship, usually reflecting rather prescribed nationalistic 
ideas. Despite efforts to fix citizenship through tests, the 
idea is far too evasive to be captured in this way. Similarly, 
policies that have introduced various citizenship ‘lessons’, 
Plate 23.1  Citizenship is most often associated with 
membership of a nation-state.

Spotlight box 23.1
Defining citizenship?
Citizenship traditionally refers to a person’s relationship 
with a nation-state. It defines who is or isn’t a member 
of a country and the rights and duties associated with 
that membership. But citizenship refers to more than 
a set of laws that define a person’s rights and duties 
in relation to a nation-state. Anderson et al. (2008) 
describe it as ‘people’s senses of belonging in rela-
tion to places near and far; senses of responsibility 
for the ways in which these relations are shape; and a 
sense of how individual and collective action helps to 
shape the world in which we live’. Understandings of 
citizenship require consideration of the ways in which 
political structures shape, and are shaped by, personal 
identities, institutional structures, everyday actions and 
symbolic landscapes. Barker (2010) refers to citizen-
ship as an ‘unstable outcome of ongoing struggles’. It 
is therefore difficult to pin down, both as a concept and 
a lived reality. It is the contested, multiscalar and, per-
haps, ephemeral nature of citizenship that makes it of 
interest to geographers.

Electoral geographies, citizenship and 
beyond
Formal structures of government and governance reveal 
much about citizenship and the ability of individuals to 
engage with decision making and democracy at local 
and national scales (Plate 23.2). Universal suffrage is 
considered a key political right, and the right to vote has 
been fought for, sometimes using other civil rights includ-
ing freedom of speech and the right to protest (see Case 
study 23.1, for example). It would be naïve, though, to 
assume that a universal right to vote implies equality 
amongst citizens. Geographers have critically examined 
electoral systems and the social and political outcomes 
of their organization (Johnston 2005). In some cases, 
electoral boundaries can be manipulated through prac-
tices such as gerrymandering (altering electoral bound-
aries to suit particular political parties) to influence the 
outcome of elections. Governments may also seek to 
allocate goods and services to particular places to solicit 
or reward support.
Other authors have examined how minority groups 
continue to be excluded from electoral politics (Secor 
2004). Women, for example, are under-represented in 
positions of power; the young are less likely to vote and, 
conversely, parties may favour welfare benefits aimed at 
older votes, such as free travel on public transport, as 
they are deemed more likely to vote and, hence, influ-
ence the outcome of an election. It has been suggested 
that a disenfranchisement of some groups from electoral 
politics has contributed to a stratified decline in electoral 
turnout. In the UK’s 2015 General Election, the come-
dian Russell Brand stated he would not vote in protest 
against a political system that has created a ‘disillusioned 
underclass’ and encouraged young people to do the 
same (although he later changed his mind and voiced his 
support of the Labour Party). Other commentators have 
also questioned who politicians are serving and whether 
multi-national cooperations now have more influence than 
democratically elected politicians. Noreena Hertz com-
mented, ‘as citizens we must make it clear to govern-
ment that unless government focuses on people as well 
as business . . . we will continue to scorn representative 
democracy, and will chose to shop and protest rather than 
vote’ (Hertz 2001: 212). Others have argued that as many 
citizens do not participate in any political actions, a closer 
focus on social citizenship is required (MacKian 1995).
Much attention has been given to new structures of 
governance that combine governmental and non-gov-
ernmental organizations and whether they offer ‘active 
citizens’ new or better opportunities to participate more 
fully in local decision making (Painter and Jeffrey 2009). 
Other geographers have paid attention to actions out-
side formal political structures that seek to challenge 
rather than comply with state readings of citizenship. 
The scope, nature and significance of these actions 
ranges from local, tactical protests to globalized cam-
paigns that use space as part of a broader strategy of 
resistance (Spotlight box 23.3).
Plate 23.2  Voting in elections is an important 
political right, yet many groups, including women 
and the young, are frequently under-represented in 
electoral politics.

action, and an ‘active’ citizen who responds to govern-
ment calls to undertake voluntary work to replace ser-
vices once provided by the state (Spotlight box 23.2).
These contrasts are important as different norma-
tive theories of citizenship can be used to evaluate gaps 
between what rights citizens are entitled to and the gap 
‘duties’, ‘service’ and ‘charters’ have been criticized for 
following a particular vision of citizenship. Yet what is 
viewed as ‘good’ or acceptable citizenship is subject to 
contest (Staeheli 2011). There are stark differences, for 
example, between ‘activist’ citizens who seek to challenge 
governments, often through civil disobedience or direct

warrior, a patriarch and an owner of slaves. Although 
contemporary citizenship aims to be inclusionary and 
more equitable, exclusion continues to cast a ‘long 
shadow’ across the concept (Bellamy 2008). For example, 
despite universal suffrage in the West, the geographies of 
elections reveal much about social difference and power 
(Spotlight box 23.2).
Contemporary citizenship emerged with and continues 
to be strongly associated with the Western nation-state 
(Turner 2012) and, for most, is simply conferred by birth 
within the territory of a state (jus soli or ‘law of the soil’) 
or through family or ethnic descent (jus sanguinis or ‘law 
of the blood’) (Bauder 2014). These categories can be 
subject to contest. In 2004, a referendum in the Repub-
lic of Ireland led to an amendment of its constitution to 
remove citizenship from any future Irish-born children of 
immigrant parents (Tormey 2007). The favouring of jus 
sanguinis over jus soli reflected concerns about a perceived 
increase in immigration, especially by asylum seekers, and 
‘baby tourism.’ Tormey (2007) suggested that the refer-
endum succeeded as its advocates successfully positioned 
citizenship as ‘a moral regime’ with foreign nationals, 
their offspring and foetuses as ‘suspect patriots’.
Being a citizen of a country contributes to its sense of 
national identity and is an important part of state-build-
ing (Jones et al. 2004). It confers a sense of membership 
that, like membership of any organization, determines 
what someone is entitled to (rights) and what he or she 
is expected to contribute (duties). Precisely how citizen-
ship has been defined and practised has varied over time 
and space, reflecting a state’s political and social history 
(Case study 23.1).
T.H. Marshall’s (1950) key essay ‘Citizenship and 
social class’ outlined the growth of civil, political and 
social rights over time in Britain (Table 23.1). Marshall 
noted that the development of a national set of rights 
brought with it a shift in the geographical focus of citi-
zenship, from the local to the national. Thus, national 
institutions and bureaucracies replaced local charities in 
the provision of social rights. Marshall argues that as the 
institutions responsible for these rights became remote, 
citizens needed to employ experts or intermediaries to 
recognize and realize the rights afforded to them. Offices 
of the welfare state, for example, advise upon and deliver 
(or increasingly deny) social benefits to those in need of 
them. It has been suggested that this has led to a ‘thin’ or 
passive form of Liberal citizenship, one where the citizen 
expects rights to be delivered to him or her by the state 
rather than contributing to their delivery (Desmoyers-
Davis 2001). Other forms of citizenship have developed 
in other places. Republican models, for example, have led 
to ‘thicker’, more active form of citizenship that places 
greater emphasis on the duties of citizens. These ideals 
between these in reality. We might assume, for example, 
that all citizens should be treated equally but many peo-
ple continue to be excluded from full citizenship in de jure 
(legal) or de facto (actual) terms on the basis of race, sex-
uality, gender, disability, age, wealth and other forms of 
social labelling (Smith 1989b). Studies of citizenship not 
only draw attention to social inequalities but the political 
structures that cause it and, significantly, how they can 
be challenged and changed. For example, the language 
of rights may be used to contest racism, exploitation in 
the workplace, or poor access to services (Tonts and Lar-
son 2002). New forms of political engagement, such as 
women’s cooperatives in the majority world, can form 
a platform for new voices to be heard and empowered.
Understandings of geography and citizenship are 
deeply and mutually intertwined. Citizenship ‘marks a 
point of contact between social, cultural and political 
geography’ (Smith 2000: 83) and challenges us to think 
across our various sub-disciplines. At the same time, citi-
zenship requires an appreciation of geography. Its multi-
scalar nature (Painter 2002) means that ‘geography as a 
discipline is uniquely placed to work through what citi-
zenship may mean at a wide diversity of levels’ (Askins 
and Fuller 2006: 4).This chapter explores the exciting 
relationship between geography and citizenship across a 
series of spaces from the local to the global. It starts by 
considering the nation-state, which is still seen by many 
as the bedrock of citizenship.
23.2 Bounded citizenship
Citizenship has been described as a bounded concept 
(Isin 2012). This is in two ways. First, citizenship is 
widely defined as membership of a political community 
that has formally recognized boundaries (Smith 2000). 
In other words, citizenship is territorial and bound into 
the dimensions of a particular geographical unit. Second, 
citizenship might be thought of as ‘social glue’ that binds 
people to each other and a territory. It promotes feelings 
of belonging, identity, duty and entitlement.
Over time, the territories of citizenship have changed 
(Painter and Philo 1995). The idea originated in the Clas-
sical period, which, in turn, influenced ideas and practices 
of citizenship in the West (Bellamy 2008). Greek citi-
zenship, for example, was associated with the territory 
of a particular city-state and could not be transferred 
to another. The duties of citizenship were onerous and 
required an active contribution to public life through 
political, civil, legal and military service. Classical citi-
zenship was exclusive: to be a citizen of Athens was to 
be male, over 20, born to an Athenian citizen family, a

Case study 23.1 
The complex citizenship of Hong Kong
In 1997 Hong Kong ceased to be a Crown Colony of 
the United Kingdom and reverted to the authority of 
the People’s Republic of China. In accordance with the 
1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which guaranteed 
continuity in its capitalist economy and lifestyle for 50 
years after the hand-over (Kean 2010), Hong Kong has 
been run as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of 
China.
Under British rule, efforts were made to pacify the 
people of Hong Kong in light of ‘Maoist’ influences 
from mainland China: citizenship was regarded by 
many ‘as a matter of holding passports and enjoy-
ing some degree of civil liberties’ (Shiu-Hing 2001: 
127). After 1984 more Hong Kong residents began to 
demand and apply rights of political participation. In 
part this reflected a feeling by many citizens who felt 
that self-determination was being denied to them by 
both the British and Chinese states.
Yet many of Hong Kong’s residents, particularly the 
skilled or wealthy, have sought to use citizenship as a 
personal strategy. There has been large-scale immigra-
tion to countries that offered dual citizenship, such as 
Canada or Australia, especially in times of perceived 
crisis. This form of transnational citizenship is seen by 
some as offering ‘an escape route’ if the autonomy of 
the region is ever threatened. Pivotal events have led to 
periods of net emigration, including the signing of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, the Tiananmen 
Square massacre in 1989, the outbreak of the SARS 
virus in 2003 and the global financial crisis in 2009. Yet 
Hong Kong also experienced immigration from China 
that became the subject of progressively tighter legisla-
tion. Currently some ‘one-way’ permits are offered to 
those from China with skills and qualifications in the 
information technology and financial service sectors 
rather than those who might become a burden upon 
the welfare system.
The current citizenship of Hong Kong is complex. 
In de jure terms Hong Kong citizens are citizens of 
China but the ‘one county, two systems’ paradox 
means that Hong Kong’s citizens enjoy political and 
civil rights that have not been afforded to citizens in 
the rest of China – such as the right to travel, protest 
and read a free press. Many citizens identity more 
strongly with Hong Kong than China, refusing to 
acknowledge the Chinese national day and resenting 
political interventions from Beijing (Degolyer 2001). 
This said, there is also a strong faction that supports 
closer ties with Beijing.
In September 2014, Hong Kong’s Central District 
and other areas of the city were occupied by students 
protesting for democratic reform. More precisely, the 
protests centred on proposals to reform the election 
of Hong Kong’s Chief Executive in 2017. Although 
the principal of universal suffrage had been agreed 
by the Chinese Government, in August 2015 Beijing 
ruled that voters would have a choice of three pre-
approved candidates. This prompted the formation of 
the ‘Occupy Central’ movement to campaign for pan-
democracy. Their actions were essentially part of a 
tactical protest in aid of specific rights, and so differs 
from the wider Occupy movement (Case study 23.4), 
which sought wider reforms of the capitalist economy. 
Both, however, used the tactical occupation of symbolic 
space to bring supporters together and draw maximum 
attention to their causes.
Occupy Central held marches, conducted an unof-
ficial ballot (in which nearly 800,000 people voted to 
oppose the reforms) and proposed an occupation 
of the Central District on 1 October 2014, China’s 
National Day. In the event, the occupation was 
prompted by students who had organized a boycott 
of lectures. As numbers grew, Occupy Central activ-
ists joined the students. There were efforts to break 
up the occupation by riot police using tear gas. In 
response, protestors deployed umbrellas, usually 
carried as protection against the sun, which soon 
became the symbol of the movement. The robust 
response by authorities also prompted greater num-
bers to join the protests and a largely peaceful stand-
off occurred with the authorities. Indeed, the BBC 
reported how polite and well-ordered the event was 
with protestors acting as ‘good citizens’ by tidying 
litter, doing homework and apologizing for the disrup-
tion. Although illegal, the protest was ‘allowed’ to take 
place relatively peacefully, reflecting Hong Kong’s 
autonomous position. Protests by students in Tianan-
men Square in 1989 were violently repressed by the 
Chinese security forces with the loss of an estimated 
2,000–3,000 lives. These events remind us that rights 
are rarely given away but represent the outcome of 
struggle between citizen and state.
Hong Kong’s position as a global city made direct 
intervention from the Chinese government less likely: 
to do so would damage a valuable and develop-
ing territorial and trading asset. While occupations 

Chapter 23  The geographies of citizenship    461
occurred in various places in Hong Kong, the main 
one centred on the Central Financial District. This 
was not only to cause maximum disruption to global 
business but also because the area had become 
strongly associated with Hong Kong’s emergent post-
colonial identity (Law 2002). The symbolic space 
(Plate 23.3) of the Central District was subverted 
using street art, slogans and a sense of carnival 
to draw attention to Occupy’ Central’s demands. 
Over time, people dissipated from the protest sites 
although there were interventions from Hong Kong’s 
police. The situation remains fluid and it remains to 
be seen how protestors and the authorities (of both 
Hong Kong and China) will respond in the longer term 
to popular demands for democratic reform in Hong 
Kong.

Kong. The site of the protest was chosen for its

Table 23.1  The development of rights in the UK
reflect a wariness of state power and, instead, favour 
self-governance and self-determination at the local level. 
Republican citizenship is significant in the USA (Staeheli 
2005), where participation is encouraged through town-
hall meetings, religious congregations, and participation 
in voluntary and civic groups (Turner 2002).
Both of these models are based on the experiences of 
Western countries and ideas of citizenship have tended 
to reflect European values (Isin 2005: 35). This is in part 
because the nation-state emerged from the European geo-
political arena. As European powers colonized other parts 
of the world, the European model of state-citizenship was 
imposed on them (Isin 2002, 2005). The nature of Imperial 
Citizenship ranged widely. At the one extreme were exclu-
sionary and paternalistic ideas. Thus indigenous Austral-
ians were not granted citizenship until 1968 (when they 
were also included in the census for the first time). Prior 
to this indigenous Australians were wards, not citizens, 
of the state and with very few rights. They were unable 
to marry, work or travel without the permission of the 
state; sale of alcohol, land and property was prohibited; 
mobility was restricted; and parents had no legal rights 
over their children. Other forms of Imperial Citizenship 
attempted to provide equal rights for colonized peoples. 
Prior to 1983, Citizens of the UK and Colonies had the 
right to work and live in Britain as well as to hold a Brit-
ish passport and vote in UK elections. Ultimately, though, 
Imperial Citizenship was unable to reconcile forms of citi-
zenship based on kinship and community (found in many 
non-Western countries) with individualistic notions of 
citizenship based on political rights (Gorman 2006).
In many places, tensions remain between forms of citi-
zenship based on nation-states and other associations based 
on kinship, tribes and belief. This has led Isin (2012: 567) 
to conclude that it is now ‘difficult to imagine citizenship 
merely as nationality or membership in the nation-state’. It 
is important to move beyond Western definitions and lin-
guistics to appreciate how citizenship plays out in different 

462    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
new forms of transnational citizenship (Samers 2010). 
Transnationalism, as the name suggests, recognizes 
that ideas and practices of citizenship cross national 
boundaries and flow between their borders, rather than 
being confined by them. By implication, the nation-state 
becomes less significant in the determination and regula-
tion of citizenship (Case study 23.2).
Yet, transnationalism has also prompted responses 
from nation-states. States experiencing net emigration 
have attempted to redefine citizenship for their own 
advantage. Mexico, for example, has sought to extend 
citizenship to emigrants in order to benefit economically 
from its citizens who have moved abroad (Escobar 2006). 
Indeed, more people than ever before hold dual citizen-
ship (Sassen 2002), reflecting a response by states to claim 
mobile citizens as their own.
Many states have also sought to reassert national 
sovereignty and citizenship. In many countries quo-
tas on numbers of migrants, stringent border security, 
the streamlining of removal processes, confinement of 
asylum seekers, citizenship tests, a lack of welfare sup-
port and the withdrawal of rights to work all represent 
a fortification of state boundaries and make it harder 
for migrants to achieve citizenship. Such policies have 
sought to stratify citizenship and migration. Samers 
(2010) identifies a continuum that encompasses full citi-
zens of a single nation-state; dual, transnational and 
cosmopolitan citizens with varying rights and duties; 
denizenship; and, finally, illegal residents and aliens 
with few or no rights.
In contrast to the ‘super rich’, ‘super-mobile’ citizens, 
temporary and ‘illegal’ migrants can suffer economic 
cultural settings. McEwan argues that the concept of citi-
zenship is ‘unable to recognize either the political relevance 
of gender or of non-western perspectives and experiences’ 
(2005: 971). Her work in South Africa draws attention to 
the ways in which marginalized people, including women, 
the young and unemployed youths, have carved out alterna-
tive spaces away from traditional, male-­dominated political 
assemblies from which they can be heard. Other authors 
have also pointed to the growing importance of places 
above and between nation-states to citizenship (Desforges 
et al. 2005), as the next section examines.
23.3 Beyond boundaries
For some groups of people wider opportunities to travel, 
work and live between states have led to what has been 
termed ‘transnational’ citizenship, which draws on the 
rights and identities of more than one country (Ho 2008). 
In 2013, there were over 231 million migrants on a global 
level and, between 2000 and 2013, these numbers increased 
by 2.2 per cent (UN 2013). Migration has not only acceler-
ated but has become increasingly differentiated, with mul-
tiple forms and entry points reflecting social difference at a 
global scale. On the one hand, this so-called ‘Age of Migra-
tion’ (Castles and Miller 2009) has loosened the moorings 
of citizenship from the nation-state but, on the other, has 
led to increased efforts to assert the significance of the 
nation-state as the primary determinant of citizenship.
It has been argued that new and significant forms of 
international migration and mobility are indicative of 
Case study 23.2 
Transnational citizenship in the 
­European Union
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty established the precedent 
of European Citizenship that was awarded to citizens 
of its member states in addition to their already-held 
national citizenship. This meant, for example, that a 
citizen of France also became a citizen of the Euro-
pean Union super-state (Ferbrache and Yarwood 
2015). With this status came the right for most EU 
citizens to live, work and move between the states of 
the EU (most but not all: following expansion in 2004 
and 2006 many member states restricted the right of 
citizens from accession states to migrate and work in 
their territories). European citizens availing themselves 
of these rights have contributed to the development 
of transnational business networks, wider forms of 
political participation and the growth of employment 
markets across Europe (Favell 2003). Strüver (2005) 
also found that regular cross-border movements of  
Dutch citizens living in a German border town ­identified 
as being transnational European citizens rather than 
of one nation. In some circumstances ­transnational 
citizenship has allowed physical, imaginative and 
­communicative travel between countries to the 
extent that it is getting harder to distinguish places 
of ­origin from places of settlement. Instead, they 
are ­simultaneously linked in economic, cultural and 
­emotional ways (Ho 2008).
There is, however, growing resistance to this form 
of transnational European citizenship, witnessed by 
a surge in right-wing populist political parties that are 
seeking to withdraw their nation-states from Europe 
and European political influence.

Chapter 23  The geographies of citizenship    463
(Desforges et al. 2005). This can lead to a view that sees 
local communities, rather than deeper social or politi-
cal forces, as the cause and solution of local problems 
(Rose 1996). Depending on how communities respond, 
they may be judged and rewarded with, or denied, further 
funding (Desforges et al. 2005).
In another development, many charities have been 
obliged to ‘professionalize’ their activities in order to 
win government funding or contracts (Milligan and Fyfe 
2005). This is so much so that large, cooperatist charities 
have emerged that get most of the their funding from 
government rather than private donations. Jenifer Wolch 
(1990) referred to this as ‘the Shadow State’, reflecting 
that voluntary groups now do the government’s work but 
appear separate from it.
Governments pursuing active citizenship poli-
cies have been criticized for passing the buck of wel-
fare provision to the voluntary sector, reflecting a shift  
from Liberal to more Republican forms of citizenship 
(Case study 23.3). This said, those who volunteer often 
do so out of an ethical desire to help others rather than 
government policy or institutional mission statements 
(Cloke et al. 2007). Places such as soup kitchens give 
volunteers opportunities to act on personal, political, 
religious and altruistic beliefs.
exploitation social hostility with few rights. The United 
Nations Refugee Agency has estimated that there are ten 
million people without a state, with no legal recourse to 
education, travel, work, healthcare and even a home as these 
often depend on having formal identification. Statelessness 
can arise from changes in state borders and instances where 
a person’s parents have migrated to a state that does not 
permit nationality to be passed to children. States may also 
seek to revoke citizenship as, for example, has been dis-
cussed recently by some Western states in response to those 
who have travelled to support terrorist organizations.
Transnational practices and ideas have opened up the 
possibility of new spaces of citizenship but this form of 
citizenship remains the preserve of a few. If, as Cresswell 
(2009) contends, the right to be mobile is an significant 
aspect citizenship, then it continues to be denied to many.
23.4 Local citizenship: activist citizens
Mobility is an important signifier of citizenship but, for 
many people, citizenship is something that is played out 
in the localities where they live. Staeheli (2005: 196–7) 
comments that ‘while nation-states may be where the 
formal standing as citizen is vested, it is largely through 
localities that the horizontal bonds of citizenship oper-
ate’ to mobilize citizens and create identity. Thus, vot-
ing in local elections, writing to counsellors, engaging in 
planning enquiries, participating as governors of schools 
or campaigning for local services all offer opportunities 
for citizens to engage with the running of affairs in their 
locality and, in doing so, to exercise their political and 
civic rights.
Increasingly citizens are also expected to have a duty to 
participate in their localities (Cheshire and Woods 2009). 
Over recent years many Western neoliberal governments 
have developed policies aimed at encouraging ‘active citi-
zenship’ or voluntary activity to provide or support local 
services. Examples include involving local citizenry in 
policing (Yarwood and Edwards 1995) (Plate 23.4), the 
provision of health care (Barnett and Barnett 2003), wel-
fare (Conradson 2003) and housing (Yarwood 2002). New 
Zealand has followed these principles to such a degree 
that it has been regarded as ‘a social laboratory of the 
world’ (Tennant et al. 2008: 26).
The impact of these reforms has been geographi-
cally uneven, reflecting differences in local participation 
and community leadership. Some communities, usually 
middle-class ones, are better placed to organize and help 
themselves. This may lead to more parochial forms of 
citizenship in which vocal, well-organized and compli-
ant local communities are granted more rights and duties 
than residents who are unable or unwilling to volunteer 
Plate 23.4  Neighbourhood Watch is a voluntary 
crime prevention scheme in the UK that has embodied 
state-led ideas of active citizenship. It has found favour 
largely in middle-class areas.

reliance on local charity. The growth of food banks not 
only points to the uneven terrain of citizenship, where 
the right to food seems unobtainable to many, but 
also a view that the voluntary sector are being given 
increased responsibility, even for fundamental issues 
such as hunger (Plate 23.5).
That said, many of those who volunteer to provide 
welfare are far from neoliberal policy dupes or apolo-
gists but, instead, act out of concerns driven by beliefs 
or ideals. Indeed, the space of the food bank or soup-
run allows citizens to act on personal ideals of care. 
Cloke et al. (2007: 1095) have termed this a form of 
‘ethical citizenship’ in which people volunteer ‘because 
they wanted to rather than because they felt obliged  
to’. In some cases, these activities have been viewed 
as a form of resistance by drawing attention to gaps 
in welfare provision and challenging the state policies 
(Conradson 2003; Staeheli 2013). In Philadelphia, for  
example, there has been a long-standing conflict 
between organizers of soup-runs and the Mayor, who 
has repeatedly tried to ban them from public places. 
Although volunteering has become increasingly politi-
cized, the ethics and motivations of individual citizen-
volunteers remains important. An emphasis on the 
individual citizen (Staeheli 2011, 2013) and acknowl-
edging his or her political and ethical entanglements 
with community, however imagined, is crucial to under-
standing how local places are shaped by citizen action.
Food banks: the dilemma of ethical 
citizenship
There has always been a ‘moving frontier’ between the 
state and voluntary sector in the provision of social 
welfare (Mohan 2003). Its position varies over time and 
space but, recently, it has been argued that the frontier 
has shifted away from the state and towards the third 
sector as a result of neoliberal reforms that have seen 
governments withdraw from the provision of social 
welfare. These debates have been encapsulated by 
a growing reliance on charity-run food banks in many 
countries.
Food banks originated in North America but are now 
found in most parts of the world. They are run by chari-
ties with the aim of distributing food directly or indirectly 
(via other charities) to people in need.
In many countries there has been a phenomenal 
increase in the numbers of people asking for support 
from food banks, especially following the 2007 reces-
sion. In the UK, the Trussell Trust estimate that they 
provided 913,138 people with food in 2013–14, com-
pared to 25,889 in 2008–9 (see Trussell Trust website, 
www.trusselltrust.org/stats). The charity established its 
first food bank in 2004; it now has 423 with an average 
of two new ones opened each week. The European 
Food Banks states that it distributed 402,000 tons of 
food to 5.7 million people in 2013. According to Freedom 
America, one in seven families rely on food banks and 
associated food distribution programmes.
Food banks are intended as an emergency 
response to those without food. In the UK, food is 
only distributed to people who have been referred to a 
food bank from professionals such as doctors, social 
workers, the police or the Child Support Agency. This 
entitles them to three days of food that is intended 
to fill a gap caused by, say, a delay in welfare pay-
ments. Although food banks are intended as a stop-
gap measure to supplement rather than replace the 
welfare state, critics have suggested that an insidious 
creep is occurring towards these kinds of charities 
providing more permanent forms of welfare (Cooper 
et al. 2014). For many, the increasing enrolment of 
food banks into the state welfare provision represent 
an abrogation of government responsibility (Cloke 
2011) and a shift away from universal rights towards 
Plate 23.5  Soup kitchens and food banks offer 
opportunities for people to act upon ethical and 
humanitarian convictions but may also reflect the 
state’s withdrawal from social welfare provision.

free-trade and deregulation have diminished the power 
of state governments and, consequently, the significance 
of electoral politics. As some multi-national corpo-
rations now have more power and wealth than many 
nation-states, they are more likely to respond to custom-
ers than citizens. In response, activist citizens have devel-
oped new forms of political action (Jones et al. 2004) 
that operate outside conventional political channels. 
Direct action, protest and consumer pressure are used 
to pursue economic, social, political and environmental 
goals (Routledge 2003).
NSMs are characterized by fluid alliances between 
diverse sets of people with various identities, affili-
ations and motivations that find expression in a par-
ticular campaign or form of resistance. Thus, a protest 
against the use of child labour might be supported by 
faith groups with a concern about social justice; trade 
unions seeking to improve employment rights; NGOs 
23.5 Activist citizens and  
transnational networks
Active citizenship has been criticized for promoting duties 
over rights, volunteering above political participation 
and, implicitly or otherwise, supporting the neoliberal 
roll-back of the state. By contrast, it is possible to trace 
a range of ‘deviant’ actions that also use local sites to 
challenge state and corporatist power to assert social and 
political rights. In contrast to active citizenship, which is 
largely focused on changing neighbourhoods, activist citi-
zenship is global in its concerns and reach (Parker 1999) 
(see Spotlight box 23.3).
The growth of ‘New’ Social Movements (NSMs) 
reflect a feeling, popularized in books such as No Logo 
by Naomi Klein (2001), that conventional politics is 
failing to fulfil citizens’ political rights. It is argued that 
Spotlight box 23.3
Active and activist citizens
Gavin Parker (1999) illustrates clearly the difference 
between ‘active’ and ‘activist’ citizenship (Table 23.2). 
‘Active’ citizenship operates at spatial scales below the 
nation-state – neighbourhood, community and locality 
are emphasized – but generally in support of the state 
and its policies. Hence Parker describes them as ‘good’ 
in the sense that they obey laws and use formally rec-
ognized channels for action.
By contrast, activist citizens challenge the state and 
other institutions. They often mistrust authority and feel 
obliged to voice their concerns outside its formal appa-
ratus using various forms of direct action that range in 
intensity, duration and legitimacy; from violent direct 
action to mundane acts of everyday consumption. Engin 
Isin (2008: 38) summarizes these differences in citizen-
ship aptly:
we contrast ‘activist citizens’ with ‘active citizens’ who 
act out already written scripts. While activist citizens 
engage in writing scripts and creating the scene, active 
citizens follow scripts and participate in scenes that 
are already created. While activist citizens are creative, 
active citizens are not.
They are labelled ‘deviant’ in the sense that they may 
depart from the law. What constitutes ‘good’ citizenship

Table 23.2  Citizen protest and action
is, of course, hugely subjective and reflects political and 
ethical standpoints. It reminds us that citizenship is not 
a static term but a contested one.
Although Table 23.2 is useful in drawing out different 
types of citizen action, it should not be thought of as a 
rigid binary. People may display both kinds of behav-
iour, depending on spatial and political context. One 
thing that is remarkable about New Social Movements 
is their ability to enrol a range of citizens, from Anarchist 
to Zapatista, into specific causes.

466    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
with a focus on protecting young people; Marxists 
seeking to resist free-trade capitalism and so on. These 
alliances extend across borders as activists in different 
countries share information and coordinate actions. 
These often crystallize in specific sites chosen for their 
symbolic meaning or potential to maximize the impact 
of a protest (Case study 23.4).
Peter Jackson (2010b: 139) also contends that glo-
balized flows of ideas and cultures are leading to a form 
of transnational ‘cultural citizenship’. Faith, politics, 
ethnicity and cultural practices may, for example, play a 
greater role in shaping identity as a citizen than loyalty to 
a nation. Desforges et al. (2005: 444) sum up these trends 
succinctly and optimistically:
it is the connections to strangers without – living, 
working and dying – in other places that form some 
of the most important, and potentially liberating, 
new geographies of citizenship in the contemporary 
world.
23.6 Citizenship and everyday places
The study of active and activist citizens implies that 
citizenship involves some form of conscious engagement 
with politics and/or wider society. Yet, for many people 
citizenship is something that is rarely thought about; it 
might be acknowledged when crossing a border, reflected 
upon when living in another country or drawn upon when 
rights are lost. Sara MacKian (1995: 212) has argued that 
more attention should be given to citizens who are simply 
living out their daily lives rather than choosing ‘to sit on 
committees or to shake boxes on flag days’.
Geographers have turned their attention to the 
importance of everyday spaces, such as shops, parks and 
schools, to the practice of citizenship in daily life. Painter 
and Philo (1995:195) have argued that:
If people cannot be present in public spaces (streets, 
squares, parks, cinemas, churches, town halls) without 
Case study 23.4 
The Occupy movement
The Occupy movement started in Wall Street, New York 
in September 2011. Using the slogan ‘We are the 99%’, 
the Occupy movement drew attention to the dispropor-
tional amount of wealth held by just 1 per cent of the 
population. Inspired in part by popular uprisings against 
authoritarian regimes in the Middle East (referred to in 
the media as the ‘Arab Spring’), but using global activ-
ist networks and social media, other occupations were 
established in 952 other cities in 81 countries. Occupa-
tions centred on the spaces associated with or close to 
urban financial centres including La Defense in Paris, 
the Beurs World Trade Centre in Rotterdam and Dame 
Street in Dublin. All were organized, peaceful, leaderless 
and informal, establishing agreed norms of behaviour 
and cooperation. Sites were linked electronically and 
used commons symbols, notably the ‘We are the 99%’ 
logo and Guy Fawkes masks (Plate 23.6) based on the 
film V for Vendetta. Globally coordinated days of action 
were used to show solidarity and mirror the international 
reach of the corporations and individuals they opposed.
As well as wealth redistribution, Occupy also called 
for a reform of banking, a reduction in the political influ-
ence of corporations, an end to austerity measures, job 
creation and democratic reform. Camps were supported 
by a wide range of interest groups that had a common 
grievance with laissez-faire capitalism and its conse-
quences. These included trade unions, activist groups, 
faith groups, politicians, academics and musicians. 
Marxist geographer David Harvey spoke at a number 
of meetings, encouraging anti-wealth (as opposed to 
anti-poverty) protests. By the end of 2012, protestors 
had been evicted from their sites by governments using 
legal injunctions enforced by the police. The Occupy 
movement continues to exist as an informally organized 
global network that draws attention to the inequalities 
caused by modern capitalism.

mask became a world-wide symbol of the movement.

feeling uncomfortable, victimized and basically ‘out 
of place’, then it must be questionable whether or not 
these people can be regarded as citizens at all.
As was noted in the discussion of territoriality in 
Chapter 21, women, for example, may sometimes feel 
excluded from some public spaces, especially at night, 
due to the threat of sexual assault; gay people may feel it 
necessary to hide their sexuality in ‘public’; and religious, 
‘racial’ or ethnic difference may be the target of victimi-
zation, verbal or physical assault. In addition, those with 
physical disabilities may be unable to access sites, young 
people can be excluded from public space by curfews and 
the elderly may find it harder to find employment.
Although legislation has been enshrined to ensure 
equality, there is often a gap between de jure (legal) 
rights and whether these are manifest in daily life (de 
facto) (Smith 1989b). To take one example, Bell and Bin-
nie (2000: 10) suggest that ‘all citizenship is sexual citi-
zenship’ but it is often assumed to ‘hetronormative’ (i.e 
heterosexuality is the hegemonic norm) (Bell and Binnie 
2006). Sexuality impacts on the right to marry or form 
civil partnerships; practice religion; work, including ser-
vice in the military; migrate; travel; adopt children; par-
ticipate in public events; and express national identity. 
Even where legislation has improved the rights of sexual 
minorities, for example in countries where same-sex mar-
riage is legal, homophobic abuse may still occur on a de 
facto level and in particular institutional settings. Hub-
bard (2013), for example, outlines how two gay men were 
excluded from a London pub despite national legislation 
to ensure equality in terms of sexuality.
Some geographers have also drawn attention to the 
importance of non-public spaces in the formation of citi-
zenship. Feminist scholars, for example, have noted that 
domestic spaces have often been ignored in the study of 
citizenship yet provide an important context for establish-
ing and asserting women’s and children’s rights (Lister 
2003; Chouinard 2009). Institutional spaces can also be 
important as they can attempt to shape the practice of 
what is viewed as ‘good citizenship’. Schools and youth 
groups (Pykett 2009; Mills 2013) are particularly signifi-
cant here, sometimes reflecting a view that children are 
‘citizens in making’ (rather than citizens already) that 
need instruction so that they will be useful to society. 
Landscapes reflect citizenship idea through the order-
ing of buildings, monuments, open spaces, vistas and 
views (Jones et al. 2004); this is often linked to ideas of 
the nation-state (as Chapter 22 documented). In France, 
for example, through the twentieth century, the idea of 
a national identity was strengthened by the flying of a 
national flag (the tricolour), the use of the Gallic Coq as 
a national symbol, the construction of state buildings in 
prominent urban spaces and the erection of national war 
memorials in public spaces (Baker 2012). In the second 
half of the twentieth century, the advent of postcolonial 
states in the wake of the decline of European imperial-
ism led to the proliferation of such national symbols and 
rites of citizenship – such as national anthems, school 
and university systems, armies, as well as passport agen-
cies and embassies. After the collapse of the Soviet Union 
(see Chapter 20) yielded 15 successor states, each new 
state had to establish norms, laws and symbols of citizen-
ship, often raising thorny questions about who belonged 
and who would be refused citizenship and deemed a ‘for-
eigner’, since borders and citizenship rules had changed, 
even though they might still be living in the place where 
they were born.
Although the study of citizenship has traditionally con-
cerned itself with political engagement in public spaces, it 
is clear that citizenship is about more than this. Citizen-
ship is also about the way that people engage with spaces 
on an ‘ordinary’ basis (Steaheli et al. 2012). Although the 
formal rules and regulations that define citizenship are 
important, so too are the everyday negotiated practices 
that constitute belonging to a particular state or commu-
nity. Thus, interactions in schools, homes, shops, nurs-
eries and community groups help to establish migrants 
and their families as visible and valuable citizens in wider 
society (Bauder 2014). For example, Dominican immi-
grant shopkeepers were able to overcome anti-immigra-
tion sentiments in predominantly African-American and 
Puerto-Rican neighbourhoods of Philadelphia through 
daily negotiations with customers. Practices included flex-
ible pricing, stocking ‘boutique’ services and allowing the 
shop to be used as a site of interaction between ‘old’ and 
‘new’ groups of residents (Pine 2010).
The emphasis on cultural as well as political forms of 
citizenship have reflected a spatial shift in its study, from 
central, political spaces to everyday and sometimes mar-
ginal places. Indeed, Bullen and Whitehead (2005: 499) 
consider that the:
contribution of geography to the study of citizen-
ship has been . . . a changing spatial focus concerning 
where citizens are to be found – from the town hall to 
the ghetto; the public square to the private home; the 
city to the edge community.
23.7 Conclusions
This chapter has introduced the idea of citizenship and 
examined its significance across a range of geographi-
cal scales. Although traditional associations between 
individuals and the nation-state continue to have sig-
nificance, it is clear that citizenship is more than this. 

468    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
A person’s identity as a citizen is not simply a reflection 
of national belonging but, rather, is shaped by a whole 
series of local and global cultural influences that are 
played out on a daily basis upon a range of scales (Jack-
son 2010b). It is a fluid idea that is not only defined by 
political engagement but, for some, is political engage-
ment (Isin 2002). At the same time, others have also 
pointed to citizenship as being simply able to participate 
in everyday life, often in a political ways. This diversity is 
what makes the study of citizenship of interest to geog-
raphers. It pulls together social, cultural and political 
geographies to produce rounded, but not holistic, views 
of society and space. To quote from my own book, 
Citizenship:
The idea of citizenship underpins concerns between 
individual identity and performance and understand-
ings of broader political structures that shape, and 
are shaped, by these contexts. It offers a chance to 
bridge the personal and performative aspects of the 
cultural turn with the structural and institutional foci 
of political and social geography within variously and 
fluid spaces and places.
(Yarwood 2014)
It does so across a multiple and coexisting range of 
scales, from the global to the local. Thus, a householder 
who chooses to recycle goods is simultaneously engaging 
with his or her state though the local council (who may 
provide a recycling service), as well with global initiatives 
to improve sustainability, and at the same time is acting 
in the private space of his or her home.
Geographers have not only engaged with citizenship 
academically but have also performed them through per-
sonal and varied forms of political and social engage-
ments (Fuller and Kitchen 2004). The inclusion of 
citizenship in introductory textbooks such as this marks 
a recognition of its essential geography (Anderson et al. 
2008: 39). To paraphrase Cloke et al. (2005: 603): citi-
zenship matters, you matter, your citizenship matters. 
Having been introduced to geographies of citizenship, 
how and where will you practise citizenship for yourself?

Chapter 24  Global governance    471
24.1 Conceptualizing governance
The term governance, derived from the Greek verb 
kubernan, suggests notions of steering and/or piloting. 
Governance as a term is, on the face of it, a source of 
reassurance. Actions involving steering and piloting con-
note a sense of in-control, predictability and stability. 
But there are occasions where the very institutions and 
structures that (partially) govern our lives (such as inter-
national regulations) appear powerless and inadequate to 
cope with the events at hand. For example, in June 2013, 
Singaporean and Malaysian officials reported extreme 
levels of air pollution, with forest fires in neighbouring 
Indonesia widely blamed for creating a transnational haze 
over South-east Asia. It was not the first time a pollution 
haze has affected those countries, as in 1997–8 and 2006 
when once again Indonesian illegal logging practices and 
associated forest fires were cited as the primary source 
(Jones 2006). Even though these affected nations have 
entered into a legally binding agreement, via ASEAN 
(the Association of Southeast Asian Nations), to inter-
vene against the haze problem, the seeming inability of 
the Indonesian government to control management prac-
tices in large and remote forested areas of the archipelago 
stimulated intense debates about an apparent lack of and 
forms of national governance as well as the inability of 
regional treaties in governing individual states’ actions 
(see Nurhidayah et al. 2014). Moreover, it also raised 
questions about complicity and whether neighbouring 
countries, via their companies, were involved in attempts 
to circumvent restrictions on burning (Varkkey 2014).
Likewise, when severe disasters such as flooding and 
earthquakes affect communities, we gain further insights 
into what the geography (and lack) of governance looks 
and feels like – it can be devastating, as the people of the 
Philippines discovered when typhoon Haiyan struck and 
killed over 6,000 people in November 2013 and devas-
tated vast swathes of the country and its infrastructure 
(Plate 24.1). Whilst it is easy to attribute blame to ‘natu-
ral’ weather phenomenon, claims abound that the dys-
function of proper governing mechanisms (e.g. absence 
of a clear disaster preparedness program and political 
corruption that distorts relief missions) also accentu-
ated the (unequal) impacts of the disaster (see Keister 
2013). Over 1 million people were left homeless and 
some 6 million were displaced. In its aftermath, over 40 
countries supported the UN effort alongside an array of 
non-governmental organizations in attempting to both 
respond to the initial destruction and implement recovery 
and rebuilding programmes as well as to support the dis-
placed (McCall 2014). The relationship between natural 
catastrophes and governance is complex therefore and 
disasters have also frequently offered opportunities for 
states to extend their role and may become catalysts in 
the reordering of society and politics. It has been argued 
that only war offers greater potential to achieve such 
reconfigurations (Guyot-Réchard 2015).
Moreover, there are other ways in which governance 
manifests itself. For scholars working in fields like politi-
cal geography and related disciplines such as Interna-
tional Relations (IR), governance refers to a system of 
rules, norms, codes, regulations and compliance mecha-
nisms designed to regulate human activity, especially at 
the global level (Herod et al. 1998; Held and McGrew 
2002; Sparke 2006). However, the mere identification 
of ‘global governance’ presents an important challenge 
to dominant strands of IR and their depictions of the 
international arena which focus on states, as the domi-
nant actors, and how they ‘navigate’ and ‘steer’ their way 
in the global arena in order to maximise their interests 
(Donnelly 2000; Goldin 2013).
However, critics of this view (which is known as real-
ism in IR) argue that states, societies and markets are 
embedded and implicated with one another, across a 
range of geographical scales. It is apparent, moreover, 
that even if states remain the primary political actors 
there is not only a great deal of variation within the inter-
state community but also a range of other organizations 
facilitating, respecting and obstructing ‘global govern-
ance’ (for earlier reflections on colonial governance, see  
Chapter 8). The list would include non-governmen-
tal organizations, inter-governmental organizations, 
corporations and/or criminal cartels. Likewise, it no 
longer seems plausible to adhere to a rigid distinction 
between the domestic and the foreign. As John Agnew 
(1994) rightly cautions, such a domestic/foreign polar-
ity constitutes the ‘territorial trap’ whereby there is a 
neglect of the changing significance and meanings of 
states in different historical-geographical circumstances. 
Indeed, states might well continue to enjoy formal sov-
ereignty over their national territories, but they are

points, namely the Arctic and the South China Sea where 
there is no shortage of material pertaining to states and 
political leaders eager to perform, protect and exclude 
in the name of governance (as detailed in Chapter 20). It 
might seem odd to investigate maritime spaces but in doing 
so we will be able to reflect on how governance has been 
understood and implemented in watery environments. In 
so doing, we recall that 70 per cent of our planet is com-
posed of water and that the seas and oceans are complex 
spaces claimed by coastal states, traversed by commercial 
traffic, fished and exploited for its resources, and enrolled 
in legal frameworks, strategic planning and defence 
arrangements by local states, international organizations 
such as the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, and 
extra-territorial powers alike.
Initially, we consider why there has been an upsurge of 
reflection on global governance, with due reverence given 
to some relevant contextual and theoretical perspectives. 
Thereafter, the governance of the Arctic and the South 
China Sea are used as examples of how the regulation of 
these maritime spaces have become embedded in an ever 
more complex matrix of states, non-governmental organ-
izations, and international governmental bodies includ-
ing the United Nations (see Spotlight box 24.1). Finally, 
the chapter concludes with how governance questions 
remind us of the importance of accountability, access 
and authority in the contemporary world.
also deeply affected by the contemporary transnational 
flows and global capital markets. The financial crisis of 
2008–10 (and subsequent ‘austerity’), for example (see  
Plate 24.2), duly demonstrated how the notion of the 
state as a territorial container was being challenged, while 
ideas pertaining to the safeguarding of ‘national econo-
mies’ and ‘national interests’ were constantly (re)pro-
duced by political leaders and senior figures in financial 
authorities like the Bank of England, US Federal Reserve 
and European Central Bank who were eager to convey the 
impression that they were in ‘control’.
We might, at this stage, make a fundamental distinc-
tion between two kinds of political-territorial world 
orders. There is an idealized order, which in the inter-
national system is composed of states, which enjoy de 
jure sovereignty over their national territories. This 
intricate link between sovereignty and territory is often 
traced back to the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) between 
European sovereigns, whereby there is an international 
codification of the basic principles of territorial integrity, 
border inviolability and supremacy of the state. Alter-
natively, there is a functional order that is rather more 
complicated which holds the de facto view that states, for 
example, do not enjoy complete and absolute authority 
over their territorial domains. This might manifest itself 
in all kinds of ways from an inability to impose law and 
order on parts of their ‘national territory’ (as described 
in Chapter 22) to an inability to stop others interfering 
with the territorial integrity of a country (for example, in 
2014, Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and destabi-
lized eastern Ukraine, with many observers arguing that 
Russia was seeking to extend its international borders 
into Ukrainian territory). As John Agnew (2005b; 2009) 
claims, sovereignty is never complete and/or absolute – 
rather than assuming sovereignty as fixed and naturally 
tied in to the nation-state and territory, attention should 
be given to how sovereignty can function on different 
geographical scales and can be shared by multiple actors 
(Jessop 2002; Brenner 2004).
In this chapter we explore a number of themes and 
issues germane to a discussion on global governance mind-
ful of those idealized and functional senses of world order. 
But we will do so from some potentially unusual vantage 
Spotlight box 24.1
United Nations
The UN has 193 member states, a figure that includes 
the vast majority of the world’s sovereign states. Estab-
lished in 1945, it was meant to succeed the League of 
Nations, to facilitate ‘cooperation in international law, 
international security, economic progress, social pro-
gress, human rights and achievement of world peace’ 
(UN website). The League of Nations was an inter-gov-
ernmental organization whose primary goals, as stated

purpose of drawing attention to how governance gets 
made in and through particular places.
But global governance is increasingly being theorized 
through the optics of climate change as well, especially 
24.2 Theorizing global governance
In the last decade or so, terms like governance have 
become associated for many Western viewers with tel-
evision reports of political leaders, global corporations 
and international financial organizations such as the 
World Bank (see Chapter 8). G7/8/20 meetings around the 
world in places like Genoa, London, Seattle and Toronto 
further cement an impression of the rich and powerful 
gathering to manage the world (see Plate 24.4). In close 
proximity, it is common to find individuals and social 
movements taking to the streets of those aforementioned 
cities protesting against global economic and political 
integration, and highlighting the persistence of inequal-
ity (Klein 2007). The Occupy movement, a social move-
ment of anti-austerity protestors, has targeted particular 
sites of international governance and in particular the 
European Central Bank and World Bank, for the explicit

in its Covenant, included preventing war through collec-
tive security, disarmament and settling international dis-
putes through negotiation and arbitration. However, the 
onset of the Second World War demonstrated that the 
League had failed in its primary purpose. There were 
many reasons for this failure. The USA had refused to 
join – following political debate and lack of consensus 
over the League in the US Senate. It has also been 
pointed out that the structural weakness of the organi-
zation – many decisions required the unanimous con-
sent of the entire Assembly which made conclusive 
and swift action difficult – culminated in its eventual 
demise (see Gill 1996; Pollock 2003). The inspiration 
for the formation of the UN thus stems from the wish 
for a more effective organization for the managing of 
world affairs.
Headquartered in New York, the UN has six major 
elements: the General Assembly (the debating cham-
ber), the Security Council (addressing resolutions per-
taining to peace and security), the Secretariat (providing 
support for the UN), the UN Trusteeship Council (inac-
tive), the International Court of Justice (based in The 
Hague), and the Economic and Social Council (promot-
ing international economic development and coopera-
tion). There are also other major agencies associated 
with the UN, including the World Health Organization, 
the World Food Programme and UN Children’s Fund. 
The current Secretary-General is the former South 
Korean diplomat, Ban Ki-Moon, who took over the post 
in 2007 (see Plate 24.3).
The organization is funded by assessed subscrip-
tions from member states. The regular two-year budget 
of the UN and its specialized agencies are funded by 
assessments – the General Assembly approves the 
regular budget and determines how much each member 
state has to give. This is broadly based on the relative 
economic capabilities of various countries, as evalu-
ated by their Gross National Income, taking into account 
adjustments for external debt and low per capita income 
(UN website). Given that the Assembly has established 
the principle that the UN should not be overly dependent 
on any one member to finance its operations, there is a 
‘ceiling’ rate, setting the maximum amount a state can 
contribute to the budget.

474    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
‘worldwide peace and prosperity’. Premised on a market-
driven approach in shaping the political and economic 
priorities of the state, neoliberalism is unequivocally 
represented as a force that will lift the whole world out 
of poverty as more and more communities embrace and 
partake in the workings of the capitalist global economy 
(Tickell and Peck 2003). Thus, the critics complained that 
underlying claims to good governance was actually a dis-
ciplinary impulse (a form of governmentality, see Spot-
light box 24.2) in which governments and their national 
populations were trained to operate in new ways, with 
the incentive being that they were more likely to attract 
additional aid and investment (Larner 2003; Watts 2003). 
In this sense, governance came with certain caveats and 
stringent conditions.
It was no accident that good governance debates and 
structural adjustment coincided with the decline of the 
Cold War and the intensification of a sense of global 
interdependence (see Chapter 8). To put it bluntly, North-
ern states were still eager to control further aid packages, 
while at the same time take advantage of new economic 
opportunities in emerging markets, especially with the 
demise of the Soviet Union and Cold War networks and 
relations (see Chapter 21). For Southern states, espe-
cially those with weak economies and limited control 
over their national territories, these kinds of demands 
were accepted as part of what was termed ‘structural 
adjustment’. For instance, many Latin American nations 
including Mexico, Argentina and Brazil implemented 
both internal and external changes (notably privatization 
and deregulation and the reduction of trade barriers) in 
the 1980s so that they could qualify for loans from IMF 
and the World Bank to ‘save’ their debt-ridden econo-
mies. Furthermore, international institutions asserted 
further control in the late 1990s when the subject matter 
of corruption was addressed. Countries such as Kenya 
that were judged to be aberrant for a period of time had 
funding support suspended (see Chapter 17).
In the aftermath of the 11 September 2011 attacks 
on the United States, this good governance trend was 
supplemented by further financial and military pres-
sures. Fearful of a repeat of 9/11, the USA led attempts 
by the international community to control more closely 
financial flows and, at the same, intervene in the global 
South if concerns were expressed that some countries 
and regions might harbour terrorists and their terror 
networks. This concern for ‘quasi-states’ (as Intera-
tional Relations theorist Robert Jackson (1993) had 
termed them) and ‘weak states’ manifested itself in the 
invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and surveillance and 
other military initiatives elsewhere. For example, the 
firm belief that Philippines’ susceptibility to transna-
tional terrorist networks due to its government’s weak 
as it relates to how contemporary capitalism is complicit 
in continued environmental degradation, greenhouse gas 
emission and fossil fuel production and consumption. 
In her provocative book, This Changes Everything, the 
Canadian author Naomi Klein (2014) argues that our 
ability to act decisively with regard to climate change 
mitigation is constrained by ideological and structural 
forces. She argues that, ‘we have not done the things that 
are necessary to lower emissions because these things 
fundamentally conflict with deregulated capitalism ... 
We are stuck because the actions that would give us the 
best chance of averting catastrophe – and would benefit 
the vast majority – are extremely threatening to an elite 
minority that has a stranglehold over our economy, our 
political process, and most of our major media outlets’ 
(Klein 2014: 18). For this critic, governance is effectively 
‘captured’ by self-interested political and financial elites. 
All of this placed further pressure on those attending the 
2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris to secure 
meaningful progress on greenhouse emission reduction.
In discussing global governance, we need to address 
two different constituencies. First, we should provide 
some contextual detail to these aforementioned activi-
ties. Why, for example, is it now so common for high-level 
meetings between the G7 and G20 to attract such pro-
tests, violence and even death? Second, how have theo-
rists explored the nature of governance with reference 
to world order? Who, for example, benefits from good 
governance?
In an earlier phase, the 1980s and 1990s, governance 
was a subject matter more often reserved for discus-
sions of the global South (Sheppard and Nagar 2004; 
Slater 2004). Indeed, as Williams et al. (2009: 3) rightly 
note, this period has seen the global South being con-
stantly represented ‘as a collection of place and peoples 
in need of external (i.e. Northern) intervention’. Under 
the euphemism of ‘good governance’, it was argued by 
international institutions like the World Bank and leading 
states such as the USA that public decision making would 
be better served if state bureaucracies were reduced, 
legal systems reformed, accountability improved, for-
mal democracy and democratic institutions entrenched 
and market led reforms implemented. For the critics 
of good governance, these reforms were empowered by 
a neoliberal economic vision, which placed a premium 
on a reform package designed to make Southern econo-
mies more ‘accessible’ to foreign direct investment and 
corporations (Harvey 2005). As Roberts’ et al. (2003: 
887) put it, neoliberal idealism, bolstered by the ‘simple

Governmentality
Developed by the French philosopher and historian 
Michel Foucault (see Plate 24.5) in a series of essays 
delivered at the College de France in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s, it addresses the ways in which subjects are 
governed via a series of techniques and rationalities. 
In so doing, it considers how governments attempt to 
manage their populations. Foucault himself described it 
as the ‘art of government’ and suggested that authori-
ties might control populations in a manner whereby 
particular understandings of how to behave and act 
become simply accepted without contestation. Neo-
liberal governmentality, for instance derives its power 
in part from the image of the absentee state and the 
acceptance of market mechanisms as the best way to 
allocate resources. However, as Peck (2004) cautions, 
the practical content of neoliberal reform strategies is 
often quite ‘interventionist’, albeit in different ways. In 
his words, neoliberal imperatives are always melded 
with ‘a range of paternalist, authoritarian, developmen-
talist and socio-democratic state form, together with 
the concomitant ascendancy of (appropriately elastic) 
notions of governmentality’. Hence beyond the clichés 
of more market/less state, the neoliberal script actually 
suggestively encompasses a wide range of proactive 
state strategies designed to refashion state–economy 
relations around a new constellation of elite, manage-
rial and financial interests. In this formulation, there 
is a restructuring (rather than ‘rolling back’) of state 
responsibilities and spatialities – contemporary phe-
nomena like the proliferation of NGOs, many of which 
are organized, financed or co-opted by national govern-
ments or international agencies, many of which deliver 
services and operationalize discourses that were once 
the privileged province of nation-states and their local 
outposts, signifying that the clean lines once imag-
ined to exist between the national state and the off-
shore world, or between bureaucracy and civil society 
have become increasingly complicated (Ferguson and 
Gupta 2002; Brenner et al. 2003). What this means is 
that there is no one simple outcome to neoliberal gov-
ernmentality, comprising a series of unified and fully 
integrated market-oriented policies; the focus is placed 
instead on how these ‘neoliberal’ processes are medi-
ated and played out in different historical-geographical 
circumstances.

control over peripheral islands with ongoing separatist 
insurgencies has led to the USA deploying armed forces 
(in tandem with those of the Philippines) in the name 
of dealing with such potential threats (Glassman 2005; 
Woon 2009). Thus, it can be seen that countering ter-
rorism, promoting market-led reform and geopolitical 
realignment in the aftermath of the Cold War have all 
played their parts in reshaping contemporary global 
governance. For the critics, including the protestors that 
gathered at some G20 meetings (and those in the Occupy 
movement, which was examined in Chapters 21 and 23), 
these transformations have deepened market hegemony 
and arguably reduced the capacity of many countries to 
manage their own affairs.
Making sense of these kinds of changes has attracted a 
range of theoretical perspectives, and we can only briefly 
review the major ones. For disciplines such as Interna-
tional Relations (IR), a consideration of governance is 
never far removed from the central concern of order. 
For a theorist such as Hedley Bull (1995), order in world 
politics was epitomized by ‘concerns [for] the pattern 
or disposition of international activity that sustains the 
elementary, primary or universal goals of the system and 
society of states’. These goals included: the preservation 
of the system, the maintenance of peace, and the uphold-
ing of the sovereign independence of states. For other the-
orists, order has also been understood as embracing both 
the production and preservation of stability and regular 

476    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
others that the prevailing system should be preserved. 
This approach has enjoyed renewed popularity in recent 
years because of interest in the growing importance of 
China (connected with the debates described in the clos-
ing section of Chapter 20) and debate about whether 
this might lead to a new hegemonic power replacing Pax 
Americana. Some have argued that a decline of Ameri-
can power and the rise of new challengers might be seen 
not simply as a putative transition from one hegemon to 
another, but a change in the very nature of hegemony, 
from one of states closely connected with their ruling 
classes to a more dispersed pattern (see Figure 24.1), 
whereby ‘What binds these diverse regions and actors 
together is a shared commitment to an ideology of mar-
ket economics and a growing recognition that territorial-
ity alone is not a secure basis for economic or geopolitical 
power’ (Agnew and Corbridge 1995: 205–7).
Others have explored world orders on the premise 
that stability is ensured by a so-called balance of power. 
This is largely based on what IR calls a realist under-
standing of world politics, which posits that states are 
patterns of behaviour within the system of states and, as 
a consequence, the promotion of cooperative behaviour 
(Elster 1989).
This understanding of order remains influential but 
the nature of that order might, and indeed does, vary 
over time and space. For some theorists, the long-term 
stability of any world order depends on the role of a 
hegemonic party (Gilpin 1989, Cox 2001). In this con-
ception, hegemony, denoting the political, economic, 
cultural and especially ideological dominance that one 
group, state or class has over others, is widely seen as the 
necessary condition for harnessing stability in the global 
arena. Hegemony is not simply domination, but relates 
to the capacity to persuade others that the system as a 
whole is also in their interests. As such, interest is devoted 
to the role of the United States in the post-1945 era in 
shaping and maintaining a new international economic 
and political order based on ideas such as free trade and 
economic liberalization. While a hegemonic state might 
enjoy extraordinary military and other power capabili-
ties, its influence lies in part in its capacity to persuade

Chapter 24  Global governance    477
(2000) claim that EU possesses a multi-level governance 
system is premised on the observation that overlapping 
competencies among multiple levels of government and 
the interaction of political actors across those levels exist 
within the regional bloc. Concurring that member state 
executives, while powerful, are only one set among a 
variety of actors in the European polity, Leitner et al. 
(2002), on the other hand, exemplify how transnational 
networks among cities and regions in the EU are good 
examples of new political relations emerging across 
national boundaries, but situated at subnational politi-
cal scale. According to them, the ‘horizontal collective 
action among cities and regions, forged around a com-
mon agenda of mutual advantage [crosses] – and may 
challenge – the hierarchical relations between different 
scales of political governance (local, regional, national 
and supranational)’ (Leitner et al. 2002: 296–7) (see too 
Chapter 14 and Spotlight box 20.3).
Subsequent work informed by the Kantian tradition 
has investigated further the manner in which like-minded 
states create international regimes for the purpose of 
sharing certain rules, values and norms in the apparent 
absence of a world authority. Indeed, the initial justifi-
cation put forth by the Bush administration to invade 
Iraq in 2003 was premised on the claim that the country 
possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). How-
ever, when these alleged WMDs were not found on Iraqi 
soil, the argument shifted to the notion that the Saddam 
regime was a dictatorship, and abusive of human rights 
(see Dalby 2003; Flint and Falah 2004). In both cases, 
while many members of that American administration 
were sceptical of the UN, they still wanted nonetheless 
the imprimatur of the UN Security Council. And the 
subsequent arguments about the legality of the US-led 
invasion of Iraq were rooted, on all sides, in competing 
arguments about international law and the scope of exist-
ing UN resolutions addressing Iraq’s behaviour regarding 
weapons of mass destruction and human rights abuses. 
The debate was also mired in accusations that Iraq’s sub-
stantial oil reserves were an important strategic consid-
eration within the Bush administration (see Chapter 5 
and Le Billon and El Khatib 2004).
Governance, in this sense, is a shared if imperfect pro-
ject in which states (and the emphasis often remains on 
these actors) seek to embed and develop an international 
society. For Kantians, the existence of democratic/repub-
lican states was considered to be critical to the long-term 
viability of such an international society not least because 
it was believed that democracies were less likely to wage 
war on one another. But in a world where not all states 
are democracies (and the democratic spectrum is a broad 
one), theorists disagree about what kinds of conditions 
improve stability and order.
constantly in the processing of negotiating their relations 
with one another, and that this occurs against a back-
drop in which there is no single overreaching authority 
(the UN is itself an expression of the member states, not 
above them). The international system is judged to be 
anarchical because there is no effective world govern-
ment. So, as a consequence, states have to coexist with 
one another, sometimes uneasily. In so doing, if there is 
a stable world order then it is likely to be balanced by 
two or more states acting as restraining influences. So, 
according to this concept, the Cold War era was com-
paratively stable because the Soviet Union and the USA 
counterbalanced one another. What matters under this 
approach is a concern for power projection and the eco-
nomic and military strengths of states. Of course these 
different forms of power and governance may coexist, 
albeit with the emphasis between them and their relative 
significance evolving.
As we have noted, from this vantage point, the United 
Nations is not considered to be any kind of substitute 
for the absence of world government. Fundamentally, the 
UN is a collective of individual member states, which cur-
rently stands at 193. Realists tend to be sceptical about 
the nature and scope of the authority of this international 
body. This scepticism is in part rooted in the experiences 
of the League of Nations, which proved unable to prevent 
conflict in the inter-war period, and the experience of the 
Cold War where the superpowers both routinely margin-
alized the UN when it did not suit their purposes. Crit-
ics of contemporary US foreign policy would also note 
that the Bush administration was eager to by-pass any 
restraints imposed by the UN General Assembly when it 
came to seeking authorization for the US-led invasion of 
Iraq in 2003.
Finally, other scholars have considered how states 
work together to create something akin to an interna-
tional society. Mindful of a lack of world government 
and inspired by the writings of Immanuel Kant (Spot-
light box 24.3) and his studies of ‘perpetual peace’, these 
analysts consider how governance is addressed through 
restraint and cooperation. How do sovereign states 
seek to avoid confrontation and exercise restraint? One 
answer is by building ‘thick relationships’ that empha-
size mutual interdependence and universally accepted 
norms. For these authors, the creation of the United 
Nations and later regional blocs such as the European 
Union (EU) is emblematic of this trend of seeking to 
promote interdependence and cooperation. In particu-
lar, the EU has frequently been utilized as a case study 
to exemplify how multi-level governance has functioned 
to enable the formation of interlocking and collabora-
tive networks between various nation-states (Paasi 2003, 
2009; Bialasiewicz et al. 2005). For instance, Sbargia’s 

478    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
were to further entrench a particular global order – one 
that is perhaps best understood as a neoliberal one, 
empowered by shared values, norms and rules designed 
to ease global exchange. But the notion of ‘shared’ should 
not blind us to the fact this is an imposed project. Gov-
ernance, as Richard Ashley (1987) once noted, is via 
imposition – imposing rules, silencing others and their 
knowledge, practices and projects.
Whatever understanding of governance we choose 
to adopt, it is never divorced from fundamental ques-
tions of power and knowledge. The manner in which 
the world appears to be organized and managed is not 
a natural condition of global life. The prevailing global 
At a systemic level, there is broad agreement that the 
development of multilateral institutions and institution-
alized cooperation has been tremendously important in 
shaping contemporary global governance. Whether it is 
expressed through the United Nations and/or organi-
zations such as the World Bank and IMF, states and 
non-state actors alike are embedded in a whole raft of 
obligations and restraints ranging from global human 
rights to international trade law and intellectual prop-
erty rights. While the United States might be unrivalled 
as a military power, it is also deeply dependent on others 
for its economic and financial stability. Indeed, as noted 
earlier, the effects of the ‘good governance’ developments

Immanuel Kant
Immanuel Kant (see Plate 24.6) was an eighteenth-cen-
tury philosopher who wrote an essay in 1795 entitled 
‘Perpetual peace: a philosophical sketch’. Kant outlines 
what he calls some ‘preliminary articles’ necessary for 
more pacific relations between states including ‘No 
independent states, large or small, shall come under 
the dominion of another state by inheritance, exchange, 
purchase, or donation’. He then outlined what he called 
three definitive articles which would provide the neces-
sary foundation for peace itself: every state should be 
republican, the ‘law of nations’ would function amongst 
a federation of free states and a law of world citizen-
ship would be based on universal hospitality. Kant talked 
about republican not democratic states, which would be 
defined by representative government and that legis-
lature will be separated from the executive branch of 
the government. He also does not regard that repub-
lican governments are sufficient by themselves to pro-
duce peace; rather he envisages some kind of league 
of nations and freedom of emigration that would be 
necessary to manage human affairs (Archibugi 1995; 
Kleingeld 2004). It is perhaps unsurprising then that 
observations have been made that the EU is in some 
ways Kantian, given how its regional structures and inte-
grative (economic and immigration) policies are largely 
indicative of Kant’s model of a ‘federation’ of states 
(Elden and Bialasiewicz 2006; Wolin 2010). This is con-
trary to the USA’s (generally realist) view of the world, 
in which the absence of an effective world government 
signifies that the USA has to take the lead in maintaining 
peace and order in an otherwise anarchical geopoliti-
cal scene. Such a distinction, according to scholars like 
Balibar (2003), was most clearly seen in the post-9/11 
era whereby (the majority of) Europe’s attachment to 
international laws and norms to deal with ‘terrorism’ 
is contrasted to America’s enhanced world role in this 
transformed security condition.

the EU. One event often cited as transformative in that 
regard was the 2007 planting of the Russian flag on the 
bottom of the central Arctic Ocean. Images of an under-
water submersible gently dropping the titanium flagpole 
into place were widely circulated in national and global 
media networks (Dodds 2010). For Russian audiences, the 
flag planting exercise was widely interpreted as indica-
tive of national prowess and technological sophistication 
even if the expedition itself was privately funded by a 
Swedish benefactor. For others, including senior Cana-
dian political officials, the expedition and flag planting 
ceremony was judged to be provocative and unnecessary. 
While international lawyers noted that such an activity 
had little to no international legal significance, political 
scientists and journalists were penning evaluations of 
the resource and strategic significance of the Arctic in 
the post-Cold War era, while raising the spectre of un-­
governability (Anderson 2009; Emmerson 2010; Spotlight 
box 24.4 and Chapter 5).
This flag planting episode brought to the fore both 
the changing geopolitical representation of the Arctic 
and, relatedly, the governance of the Arctic, and specifi-
cally the role of international cooperation between and 
beyond states. Six years after the flag planting episode, 
however, the geographical imaginaries surrounding 
the Arctic were altered substantially when five ‘Asian 
states’ namely China, India, South Korea, Japan and 
Singapore became observers to the Arctic Council and 
in so doing encouraged a broadside of media commen-
tary reflecting on the growing role of these countries 
and what that might mean for cooperation and indeed 
competition (see Solli et al. 2013). Almost inevitably, 
China’s role in the Arctic was scrutinized most closely 
with concern raised by some that Chinese financial and 
political investments might destabilize existing govern-
ance arrangements.
economic order, based on neoliberal capitalism and good 
governance strategies, is a human creation. The rules, 
norms and values selected to regulate that order are 
also imposed. This in turn shapes public debate about, 
for instance, feasible policy options. Some policies and 
practices appear more ‘reasonable’, such as cutting public 
spending in the aftermath of a financial crisis, and those 
that seek to challenge those policies are often presented as 
iconoclastic and disruptive, such as activists, students and 
trade unionists. The prevailing norms and mechanisms 
of governance work to promote particular agendas, and 
geographers are increasingly mindful of how those ‘struc-
tures’ of governance impact, in highly differential ways, 
upon communities and places around the world.
Let us now turn to the case studies of the Arctic and 
South China Sea to find some evidence of how institu-
tions, networks and processes associated with governance 
shape these two increasingly contested oceanic spaces. 
We focus on these two examples not to suggest that they 
are in any way unique or exceptional. Rather, in line with 
growing acknowledgements that seas and their associated 
maritime geographies can provide important geopolitical 
insights (Steinberg 2001; Steinberg and Gerhardt 2015), 
we argue that there is plenty of evidence to be gathered 
about how their governance works, according to prevail-
ing norms and values associated with the contemporary 
neoliberal economic and political order.
24.3 Governing the Arctic Ocean
In the last decade, the changing physical conditions in the 
Arctic region have generated scores of commentaries (see, 
for example, Johnson 2010; Young 2012), and captured 
the attention of states and other organizations including 
Spotlight box 24.4
Defining the Arctic
Definitions of the Arctic region vary from those based 
on biological, climatic and/or geographical factors, such 
as the Arctic Circle and/or political criteria. The Arctic 
Council’s definition includes all oceans and territories 
north of the Arctic Circle and adjacent territories in Sibe-
ria and North America, and southern oceanic regions in 
the Atlantic and Bering Strait (see Figure 24.2). All eight 
members of the Arctic Council are typically described 
as ‘Arctic states’, namely Canada, Denmark/Green-
land, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and 
the United States. Of those eight, five are described as 
Arctic Ocean coastal states (Canada, Denmark/Green-
land, Norway, Russia and the United States) because 
of their geographical proximity to the Arctic Ocean and 
the rights they acquire under the terms of the United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Chapter 24  Global governance    481
The two strands (i.e. geopolitics and governance) are 
closely inter-related because debates over polar govern-
ance have followed on from a sense in which the Arctic is 
in a state of physical and geopolitical flux (Johnson 2010; 
Dodds and Nuttall 2015). To put it simply, during the 
Cold War, while the Arctic was indisputably a frontline 
between the USA and the Soviet Union, it was a region 
in which the presence of thick sea ice acted as a physical 
barrier to movement and extra-territorial interest – it was 
a space of ‘thin governability’. The Arctic Ocean, while 
accessible, was not characterized by the kind of accessi-
bility that might have been taken for granted in the other 
maritime spaces such as the Mediterranean and South 
China Sea. Both the Soviets and the US navies developed 
polar strategies predicated on the belief that each side 
would seek to contain the movement of their enemies’ 
submarine fleets in particular and were not concerned 
about Korean, Chinese and Japanese shipping operators, 
for example.
The dominant Cold War conceptualization of Artic 
security was, therefore, based on containment (as part of 
the wider Cold War geopolitics examined in Chapter 20) 
rather than territorial transgression. As part of this con-
tainment exercise, both sides conducted an assortment 
of underwater, drifting ice and aerial surveillance opera-
tions of the kind depicted in films such as Ice Station 
Zebra (1968) and The Hunt for Red October (1990) (see 
Plate 24.7). One immediate consequence of such activi-
ties was to ensure that the Arctic Ocean was a highly 
militarized space with little to no evidence of coopera-
tion among the Soviet Union and the four coastal states 
in particular, namely the USA, Canada, Denmark and 
Norway. With four out of the five Arctic Ocean coastal 
states being members of NATO, this sense of the Arctic 
as a geopolitical frontline was well founded.
As the Cold War declined, the dominant geopolitical 
representation of the Arctic shifted. In part, this was due 
to the improvement of relations between the previously 
opposing sides. After Mikhail Gorbachev’s noted speech 
in 1987 calling for the Arctic to be a ‘zone of peace’, con-
certed efforts were made to improve relations between the 
five Arctic Ocean coastal states and neighbouring coun-
tries such as Finland, Iceland and Sweden. One manifesta-
tion of this rapprochement was the creation in 1996 of the 
Arctic Council (AC), which was designed to improve coop-
eration over matters of mutual concern including environ-
mental management and shipping. Polar governance was 
entering a new phase but a period nonetheless dominated

as fishing, tourism and trans-polar shipping routes, with 
their apparent promise of cutting thousands of nautical 
miles for those seeking to move freight from East Asia to 
Europe (Powell 2008).
This interest in spatial administration manifests itself 
in the interest shown by political actors, including the 
European Union (EU), in examining a variety of govern-
ance options. At present, Arctic Ocean governance is 
shaped by three key factors – the Arctic Council, the Law 
of the Sea and a host of regional regimes such as fisheries 
agreements. The Arctic Council (AC) is a soft-law institu-
tion, meaning that it is largely advisory and lacking in a 
permanent secretariat, for example (McIver 1997; Bloom 
1999). It does not have any legal competence. It cannot 
demand that member states restrain from, for example, 
drilling offshore for oil and gas. Organizationally, the 
Arctic Council has attached to its permanent member-
ship so-called observer states such as Britain, and now 
new observer states such as China, South Korea and Sin-
gapore. These ‘observer states’ cannot shape the agenda 
of the annual meetings but they are allowed to attend a 
certain amount of the formal business of the member 
states and contribute to the work of the AC. Permanent 
participants such as indigenous peoples’ groups (e.g. 
Inuit Circumpolar Council, Sami Council, Aleut Inter-
national Association) also attend the meetings of the AC 
but do not have voting rights.
Since its creation in 1996, the AC arguably demon-
strates something that is considered axiomatic by realist 
scholars, namely that states tend to veer towards self-
interested behaviour. One of the central reasons why the 
AC is a soft-law institution is that the five Arctic Ocean 
coastal states in particular were reluctant to agree to a 
more substantial treaty-based international regime, as 
found in Antarctica. Notwithstanding concerns about 
the growing accessibility of the Arctic Ocean, and the 
mounting interest from parties geographically remote 
from the region, the states concerned have sought to 
improve and indeed strengthen cooperation with one 
another in specific areas such as shipping, search and 
rescue, and environmental cooperation.
The United States and Russia have at times been reluc-
tant to strengthen the remit of the AC. Smaller states 
such as Norway, Denmark and Sweden have shown 
a willingness to strengthen the AC. Between 2006 and 
2012, the three Nordic countries agreed to create a semi-
permanent secretariat in Tromso, which later became 
permanent in 2013 onwards. This move to improve the 
coordination and networking capacity of the AC was, in 
very large part, driven by growing interest in the forum 
from outside parties. As the Arctic states recognized at 
a ministerial meeting in Greenland in 2011, there was 
more of a need to be seen to be generating more ‘Arctic 
by states and their security-led agendas. Hence, rather than 
a straightforward ‘rolling back’ of the state, contempo-
rary governmentality functions through a restructuring of 
state’s role and responsibilities – participation in an inter-
state forum whereby negotiations of positions and agendas 
are made vis-à-vis other relevant actors.
The AC is an intergovernmental organization. It is 
intended to aid and abet Arctic states in areas of common 
interest. Notably, all parties agreed that any discussions 
involving military and security matters would be avoided 
even though the Cold War was considered to be finished. 
On a more progressive note, however, indigenous peo-
ples and organizations such as the Sami Council were 
invited to be permanent participants of the Arctic Coun-
cil. Underlying the creation of the Arctic Council was a 
sense in which the members involved recognized that the 
logic of containment was neither sufficient nor desirable 
in the changed geopolitical circumstances. Instead the 
Arctic has been understood as a weakly governed space 
needing effective spatial administration.
Apart from the apparently obvious point that the super-
powers were no longer so threatening to one another (with 
the Arctic as a major theatre of operations), a key driver 
of change has been the spectre of climate change (Johnson 
2010; Steinberg and Gerhardt 2015). While serving as an 
indicator of global environmental change, melting sea ice 
was widely identified as indicative of greater accessibil-
ity in a political and material sense. Politically, the Arctic 
Ocean has attracted more interest from national govern-
ments, corporations, scientific communities, indigenous 
peoples and media networks. The 2007 flag planting epi-
sode coinciding as it did with satellite images of an appar-
ently ice-free North West Passage encouraged a maelstrom 
of media speculation about an apparent ‘scramble for the 
pole’. Materially, a more accessible Arctic Ocean raises 
the spectre of further resource extraction in areas such as 
oil and gas (see Plate 24.8), alongside other activities such

of square miles of seabed. The implications for the Arctic 
Ocean are considerable – it is likely that the five coastal 
states will enjoy collectively sovereign rights to explore 
and exploit the natural resources of virtually the entire 
maritime region and anything left over will be classified 
as ‘The Area’ and thus under the auspices of the Interna-
tional Seabed Authority.
So the notion that there is a wild ‘scramble for 
resources’ in the Arctic Ocean is misplaced in one sense. 
There is no ‘scramble’ because there is no need to ‘scram-
ble’ (Dodds 2013). In 2008, the five Arctic Ocean coastal 
states in the so-called Ilulissat Declaration re-affirmed 
their commitment to respect the Law of the Sea as the 
primary mechanism for ensuring cooperation in the Arc-
tic Ocean and thus rejecting calls for any kind of Arctic 
Treaty. Non-coastal states, under the terms of LOSC, 
enjoy rights of innocent passage in these particular mari-
time zones, subject to some regulatory rights of coastal 
states. Innocent passage, under Article 19 of the LOSC, 
is defined as:
Passage is innocent so long as it is not prejudicial to 
the peace, good order or security of the coastal State. 
Such passage shall take place in conformity with this 
Convention and with other rules of international law.
This right to innocent passage, alongside a growing 
commercial interest in trans-polar shipping routes, in large 
part explains the interests of the EU, South Korea, Singa-
pore, Japan and China, for example. The EU Commis-
sion in 2008 outlined the EU’s interests in the Arctic and 
the European Parliament called for the EU Commission to 
develop an Arctic policy in 2009. Shipping and fishing have 
been identified as core interests, and Denmark, Finland 
and Sweden are EU member states, and, at one stage, it 
was even possible that Iceland might have emerged as a 
fourth EU member state with distinct Arctic interests.
The third element shaping contemporary Arctic Ocean 
governance is a patchwork of national and regional 
fisheries management organizations such as the North 
East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, the North Atlantic 
Salmon Conservation Organization, the North Atlantic 
Conference and the North Atlantic Fisheries Ministers’ 
Conference. With the ‘opening up’ of the Arctic Ocean in 
the coming decades, as a consequence of sea ice thinning, 
a number of Arctic states and others including the EU 
Commission have called for further multilateral mecha-
nisms to be developed for the purpose of managing Arctic 
fisheries. One suggestion in particular has been to cre-
ate an Arctic Regional Fisheries Management Organiza-
tion for the purpose of coordinating such efforts across 
the Arctic Ocean. In 2014, the five Arctic Ocean coastal 
states held a meeting in Greenland to discuss the need to 
develop in advance agreement on how to manage central

Convention in 1982.

governance’. A new legally binding measure on search 
and rescue was signed and in 2013 another agreement on 
oil spill response was also negotiated at the same time 
new observers were admitted with new rules and criteria 
governing their behaviour were published.
The second major element in the governance of the 
Arctic Ocean lies in the provisions of the Law of the Sea 
Convention (LOSC) (see Plate 24.9). For the five Arctic 
Ocean coastal states, the LOSC regulates large sways of 
the Arctic Ocean by acknowledging a series of jurisdic-
tions exists, ranging from the 12 nautical mile wide ter-
ritorial sea, the 24 nautical mile wide contiguous zone 
and a 200 nautical mile wide exclusive economic zone in 
which coastal states enjoy sovereign rights when it comes 
to the exploitation of resources (Steinberg 2001; Dodds 
2010). As Article 56 notes:
In the exclusive economic zone, the coastal State has:
(a) sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and 
exploiting, conserving and managing the natural 
resources, whether living or non-living, of the waters 
superjacent to the seabed and of the seabed and its 
subsoil, and with regard to other activities for the eco-
nomic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such 
as the production of energy from the water, currents 
and winds
Moreover, under Articles 76 and 77, coastal states can 
seek to extend their sovereign rights over extended conti-
nental shelves (ECS). Interested parties, including all the 
Arctic Ocean coastal states barring the USA (which has 
not acceded to the LOSC), have (or will have) submitted 
geological and oceanographic materials to the Commis-
sion on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) based 
within the United Nations in New York. If accepted by 
the CLCS, coastal states are allowed to identify ECS and 
extend their sovereign rights over potentially thousands 

484    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
the Danish government agreed, after a referendum in 
2008, to further autonomy and the awarding of resource 
rights to the population there. So oil and gas exploration 
off the coast of Greenland in the future might provide a 
new revenue stream for eventual independence from Den-
mark, as might aluminium smelting – but this is contro-
versial, with critics fearing that Greenland will become 
dependent on multinational corporations and their strat-
egies, not to mention the whimsical nature of global mar-
kets (Nuttall 2008). Moreover, indigenous groups help to 
unite the native peoples who may be artificially divided 
by national territorial borders so that a platform is avail-
able for them to articulate their concerns. A good case in 
point is the Inuit Circumpolar Conference whereby Inuit 
living in USA, Russia and Canada often come together 
to actively elicit responsibility on the part of the Arctic 
states to deal with the issue of climate change so that a 
sustainable living environment can be made available to 
the indigenous communities (Osofsky 2006/2007).
24.4 Governing the South China Sea
The Arctic Ocean and the South China Sea are very differ-
ent in terms of their geography, climate and geostrategic 
importance. Yet there has been no lack of comparisons 
made between these two seascapes, primarily because of 
their commonality stemming from the presence of rich 
natural resources and the competition to exploit them 
(VanderZwaag and Vu 2012; Storey 2013b; Taylor 2014). 
Indeed the South China Sea – the second largest semi-
enclosed sea in the world which is bordered by China and 
eight other ASEAN states – is not only a crucial con-
duit for more than a quarter of the world’s trade volume 
(Schofield 2009) but it is also home to a large number of 
assets, notably maritime living resources as well as oil 
and gas reserves (Rosenberg 2009; Nguyen Dang 2013).
Whilst the presence of valuable resources in the Arctic 
and the South China Sea have arguably led to disputing 
claims in these two regions, the scope of such claims has 
differed greatly, however. In the whole of the vast Arctic 
area, there is only one piece of territory that is being dis-
puted: Hans Island, a 1.3 km2 atoll in the Nares Straits 
that is claimed by both Denmark and Canada. The sce-
nario in the South China Sea is far more complex, whereby 
multiple parties contest entire archipelagos. The Paracels, 
a group of some 30 small islands, reefs and shoals situ-
ated to the central north of the South China Sea, forms 
the subject of a bilateral dispute between Vietnam and 
China (including Taiwan). Further south, China, Taiwan 
and Vietnam assert sovereignty over all the atolls in the 
Spratly Islands, while the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei 
Arctic Ocean fisheries, if and when this maritime area 
becomes more accessible and more attractive to commer-
cial fishing, especially if fish stocks migrate northwards 
due to warming waters further south.
Looking ahead, the future governance of the Arctic 
Ocean is likely to be largely determined by, on the one 
hand, the continued existence of the AC and, on the other 
hand, by the provisions of the LOSC. Neither Russia nor 
the United States appears willing to act in hegemonic ways, 
although Russian involvement in eastern Ukraine in 2014 
raised the possibility that a new ‘Cold War’ might once 
again encapsulate the Arctic region. They and smaller Arc-
tic states such as Norway and Denmark/Greenland benefit 
from this ‘pooling’ arrangement and there has been a great 
deal of governance talk emphasizing how the Arctic should 
be ‘contained’ and or ‘insulated’ from crises further south.
The eight Arctic states have effectively agreed to abide 
by particular rules, customs, values and norms, while 
at the same developing their own national strategies for 
‘their’ part of the Arctic. They have also been emphatic 
in their rejection of a proposal by the EU Commission 
in 2008 to create an Arctic Treaty, along the lines of the 
1959 Antarctic Treaty. One reason for this initiative was 
to encourage the Arctic states to collaborate more closely 
with extra-territorial actors such as the EU and to work 
towards transforming the Arctic Ocean into a zone of 
peace and cooperation. For the five Arctic Ocean coastal 
states there is little or no apparent incentive to agree to 
any further treaty development. Each, in their different 
way, is eager to protect its sovereign rights in the Arc-
tic Ocean without neglecting to cooperate in areas of 
mutual interests such as fishing. But all of this can also 
be a delicate project as issues such as energy exploitation, 
shipping and fishing alongside military/strategic consid-
erations all have the capacity to be divisive.
Contemporary governance in the Arctic Ocean 
reminds us of two things. First, states do tend, as real-
ists would note, to articulate their interests in the Arc-
tic in national terms. An emphasis on national security, 
resource control and maritime surveillance is common to 
all the major policy pronouncements of the five coastal 
states (e.g. Canada’s Northern Strategy of 2007). Second, 
however, states and non-states are able to cooperate with 
one another and to create regimes and mechanisms (albeit 
with limited powers) to encourage information exchange, 
cooperation and negotiation. The establishment of inter-
national norms and conventions help to arbitrate the 
different interests of relevant parties so that issues per-
taining to the Arctic can be debated and resolved in a 
peaceful and orderly manner. Third, indigenous groups 
and organizations have become more active in demanding 
greater autonomy in terms of regional governance and 
future resource exploitation. In Greenland, for example, 

Chapter 24  Global governance    485
claim part of the group. A more recent island sovereignty 
dispute, which has nevertheless garnered international 
attention, is that between China and the Philippines over 
the ring-shaped Scarborough Reef, which comprises sev-
eral rocks to the North of the Spratly Islands. Similarly, 
for maritime boundary disputes, the situation in the South 
China Sea has proved much more challenging as compared 
to the Arctic. The two disputed areas in the High North of 
the Arctic (between Canada and America in the Beaufort 
Sea and between Canada and Denmark in the Lincoln Sea) 
are relatively small and neither has generated serious fric-
tions in bilateral relations. However, in the South China 
Sea, China’s maritime boundary claims have been expan-
sive, overlapping with the EEZs of all the littoral states.
In analyzing the multiple disputes in the South China 
Sea, many commentators have pointed to China’s uncom-
promising stance as being the main source of the prob-
lems. In justifying its claims, China has often referred 
back to official Chinese maps to indicate a discontinuous 
nine-dash line that encloses approximately 80 per cent 
of the South China Sea (see Figure 24.3). This U-shape 
line first appeared in a map in 1914 drawn by Chinese 
cartographer Hu Jin Jie (Zou 1999) – part of the claims 
considered in the closing section of the chapter – and it 
was originally confirmed by China in 1947 with 11 dashes 
entitled ‘Locations of the South China Sea Islands’ (Xue 
2014). The Chinese authorities subsequently removed 
two dashes in the Gulf of Tonkin in 1953. Although 
China has never officially clarified what the nine-dash 
line denotes, it appears that Beijing is not only claiming 
sovereignty over the atolls within the line but also ‘histor-
ical rights’ to maritime resources. In 2013 Zhiguo Gao – 
a Chinese judge on the UN’s International Tribunal on 
the Law of the Sea – published a co-authored academic 
article which argued that the nine-dash line was justified 
under international law and had ‘become synonymous 
with a claim of sovereignty over the island groups that 
always belonged to China and with an additional Chinese 
claim of historical rights of fishing, navigation, and other 
marine activities (including the exploitation of resources, 
mineral or otherwise) on the islands and in the adjacent 
waters’ (Gao and Jia 2013: 108). However, the nine-dash 
line significantly cuts into the maritime claims of the 
Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam, 
who argue that it violates their sovereign right to develop 
maritime resources provided for under the LOSC.

486    Section 5  Political geographies: geopolitics, territory, states, citizenship and governance
To negotiate these territorial and boundary disagree-
ments, several governing frameworks have been concevied 
and adopted, but they are not without their limitations. 
As with the Arctic case, contestants in the South China 
Sea have vowed to settle their differences in accordance 
with the LOSC. However, China’s commitment to exist-
ing international legal regimes has remained question-
able. For instance, few non-Chinese legal experts believe 
that the nine-dash line promulgated by China is compat-
ible with the LOSC, and in January 2013 the Philippines 
formally challenged such a cartographic imagination of 
the South China Sea. Despite China’s refusal to partici-
pate in the proceedings, the case is ongoing and the Arbi-
tral Tribunal is set to issue a verdict. However, even if 
the Tribunal rules that the nine-dash line is incompatible 
with the LOSC, Beijing seems set to ignore the ruling, 
leaving the problem unsolved.
The governance of the South China Sea has also been 
approached through the diplomatic, cooperative route, 
whereby official negotiations have been taking place 
between ASEAN and China. The initial result of this 
process is the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Par-
ties in the South China Sea, which serves as a confidence 
building measure to prevent possible conflicts that might 
arise from island disputes in the area. The implemen-
tation of this political document, however, is long and 
daunting (it took nine years for ASEAN and China to 
agree to the Guidelines for the implementation of the 
Declaration of the Conduct of Parties in the South China 
Sea), with many scholars questioning its effectiveness in 
reducing tensions over the disputed islands (see Nguyen 
2003). ASEAN is now urging China to negotiate a Code 
of Conduct in the South China Sea, which is expected to 
be binding and contain more stringent compliance mech-
anisms, but this has been met with lukewarm responses 
from Chinese officials. The fundamental problem here 
is that Beijing rejects multilateral talks vis-à-vis the 
ASEAN forum, insisting instead that disputes can only 
be resolved bilaterally – that is between China and each 
of the claimants on a one-to-one basis. However, many 
ASEAN members are extremely wary about direct bilat-
eral engagements with a big regional player like China 
because of the asymmetrical power relations involved.
Lastly, a more proactive governance approach coming 
in the form of joint development of resources have been 
mooted. According to this ‘solution’, claimant states will 
put aside their territorial claims to engage in a coopera-
tive undertaking in the exploration and exploitation of 
resources (particularly hydrocarbon ones). On the sur-
face, such a proposal is attractive given that it will help 
to ease tensions by creating a win–win situation through 
all parties having access to the valuable maritime assets. 
A practical implementation of this approach is the Joint 
Marine Seismic Undertaking (JSMU) between oil corpo-
rations of China, the Philippines and Vietnam in 2005. 
Once hailed as a ‘historic event’ or a ‘breakthrough’ 
in the cooperation amongst the actors involved in the 
Spratly Islands dispute, the JSMU is stillborn, however. 
No concrete results were being registered and no follow-
up actions have been undertaken upon the completion 
of the project. According to Schofield and Storey (2011), 
the shortcomings of such a cooperative venture are fully 
revealed insofar as it is a highly sensitive issue, with 
claimant states remaining adamant that they have undis-
puted sovereignty over the area in question.
Summarizing the preceding discussion, it can be 
seen that there are significant differences in the ways 
in which the Arctic states and South China Sea claim-
ants approach their maritime disputes. As pointed out 
in the previous section, Arctic actors have subscribed to 
the principles of neoliberal governmentality by appeal-
ing to and relying on international laws and conventions 
to govern and address their disagreements in an orderly 
manner. This resolution pathway has proved to be unten-
able in the South China Sea, however, given that coopera-
tion through legal and developmental regimes is arguably 
marred by what realists describe as the maximization of 
individual state’s interests and agendas. Under such cir-
cumstances, it is hardly surprising that pessimistic over-
tures have emerged to characterize the future of politics 
in the South China Sea. Specifically, there have been con-
tentions that the rapid modernization of China’s navy 
and the expansion of its civilian maritime agencies will 
allow the Beijing government to increase its presence in 
the South China Sea and bring coercive pressures to bear 
on the smaller claimants. The rise of Chinese military 
power will in turn provide a catalyst for regional mili-
tary modernization programs, notably in Vietnam and 
the Philippines (Bateman 2014). Others have argued that 
some ASEAN states such as the Philippines may hinge 
on the USA’s ‘pivot’ to Asia Pacific to create a common 
front with America so as to counterbalance China’s 
assertive actions in the South China Sea (Bhattacharaya 
2014). But as Storey (2013b) rightly points out, such mili-
taristic initiatives do not get to the root of the problem 
and getting the USA involved in the South China Sea 
will only provoke a more belligerent and uncooperative 
China. The key then is to return all parties to the negoti-
ating table, so that a sustainable and plausible governing 
framework can be derived to resolve the disputes in the 
region. Such a framework, according to Storey, has to 
be outcome-­oriented rather than process-driven and will 
need to factor in a cooperative ethos through adherence 
to international legal regimes, especially the LOSC, as 
well as establishing effective conflict management and 
crisis-prevention mechanisms.

Chapter 24  Global governance    487
24.5 Conclusion
In both the Arctic and the South China Sea, the govern-
ance regimes are changing in large part because of their 
further integration into the contemporary neoliberal 
world order. But this is throwing up tensions between 
states and non-state organizations. In the Arctic, a lim-
ited number of coastal states are attempting to cement 
their sovereign rights, while others such as China are 
eager to ‘open up’ the Arctic Ocean to trans-polar 
shipping routes and resource exploitation. In the South 
China Sea, a ‘more assertive’ China is widely viewed as 
reshaping interactions and dynamics amongst claimant 
states, thereby raising critical questions for multilateral 
governance in the region. International law and pro-
tocols are emerging as increasingly important mecha-
nisms for ensuring that these potential flashpoints are 
addressed in an orderly manner. And by orderly, we 
mean not only in a non-violent manner but also in 
ways that minimize disruptions to commercial activi-
ties and investment. Following Foucault, this is in line 
with neoliberal governmentality whereby international 
conventions help to arbitrate the different positions 
and interests of states so that consensual partnerships 
and collaborative efforts can be harnessed to deal with 
various issues pertaining to these two maritime spaces. 
Without suggesting the determinacy of such an out-
come, sovereign states in the Arctic and the South China 
Sea have also been eager to remind international audi-
ences that they are determined to protect their interests, 
militarily if necessary.
But debates about governance should not be restricted 
to states alone and their sovereign rights. One danger 
of focusing on world order and global governance is 
that we give states a kind of privilege they don’t merit. 
States and their claims to sovereignty don’t just exist – 
they are actively produced. Likewise claims to govern-
ance are just claims – they will have to be constantly 
negotiated with other state and non-state actors in the 
global arena. This is especially pertinent given that many 
contemporary issues can no longer be confined within 
the limits of national territorial boundaries nor can a 
singular state authority adequately deal them with. A 
good case in point is the regulation of ‘global commons’ 
(e.g. oceans and the atmosphere) whereby the role of 
the international community is essential in collectively 
governing the resources that are vital to the sustenance 
of life. Alternatively, concerns have also been raised 
with regards to the trans-national impacts arising from 
increased mobilities of people, goods and corporations 
in this globalizing era. It is then hardly surprising that 
inter-governmental organizations such as the UN and EU 
have functioned as governance regimes in facilitating dia-
logues and meaningful cooperation to tackle these ‘prob-
lems’. For instance, the cross-border danger posed by 
infectious diseases such as the deadly Ebola and Middle 
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks in recent 
years has led to the reiteration of the importance of the 
UN, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and states 
in coordinating joint efforts to deal with such dangers. 
More widely, NGOs have frequently become key agents 
in networks of governance. A good example would be the 
protests enacted by Greenpeace to critique the lacklus-
tre commitments of many states in dealing with climate 
change. In this sense, governance is never emblematic of 
a natural state of affairs. It is a complex social process 
that involves multiple actors often with conflicting agen-
das. This makes governance a highly contested endeavour 
and closely bound up with issues of power – it is not 
only capable of being supported but can also be resisted, 
rejected or even overthrown.
As the previous chapters reminded us, therefore, we 
are talking here in large part about how we, as human 
beings, choose to organize our affairs. Ideas about space, 
place, knowledge, power, international relations, govern-
ance and order are critical here and embedded within 
human cultures. Those ideas are then put to work and 
continue to inform and influence the ways in which we 
understand the world around us including our relation-
ship with others. All of this is, of course, profoundly 
geographical.
Learning outcomes
Having read this chapter you should understand:
● The term governance and the manner in which it 
has been understood within geography and related 
disciplines such as International Relations.
● The term international order and how we might make 
a distinction between functional and idealized orders.
● In the 1980s and 1990s governance was strongly 
associated with reforming government and 
economy in the global South, especially in the light 
of concerns over debt.
● Governmentality is a term developed in the writ-
ings of Michel Foucault addressing the ‘art of 
government’ and the way in which populations are 
organized and managed.

Balkanization progressive subdivision of a region into 
small political units.
Bands societies of hunter–gatherers typically number-
ing up to 500 individuals. See Spotlight box 1.1.
Billion thousand million.
Biodiversity  the variability among living organisms 
from all sources including terrestrial, marine and other 
aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of 
which they are part; this includes diversity within spe-
cies, between species and of ecosystems.
Biomass plant and animal residue burnt to produce heat.
Biosphere  that part of the earth’s surface, extending 
from the uppermost part of the earth’s rocky core (litho-
sphere or geosphere) to the lower atmosphere, including 
the hydrosphere. The biosphere corresponds to and sus-
tains the domain of life.
Biotechnology a branch of technology concerned with 
the industrial production of living organisms and their 
biological processes.
Birth rate number of babies born per thousand popula-
tion per year; known as the crude birth rate.
Bottom-up development economic and social changes 
brought about by activities of individuals and social 
groups in society rather than by the state and its agents.
Bounded applied to the behaviour of decision makers 
whose access to information, for example, is constrained 
by financial resources or time. They also have a limited 
capacity to process the information that they are able 
to obtain and they will also be constrained (bounded) 
by the environment within which their behaviour is tak-
ing place. Bounded cultures may be regarded as reac-
tions to perceived threats to local cultures, entailing a 
strong assertion of the latter. These can create a level 
of local fragmentation, with a parochial, nostalgic, 
inward-looking sense of local attachment and cultural 
identity. Bounded cultures generally involve very clear 
definitions of ‘insiders’ and ‘outsiders’ in the creation of 
a sense of belonging.
Brand boomerang  where the stories companies add 
to their goods through branding are contested by other 
stories – often about the social relations of production – 
brought to public attention by journalists, NGOs, film-
makers, artists, activists and others.
A
Abjection the process by which we seek to repress that 
which we regard as unclean, improper, impure or dan-
gerous. In geographic terms, abject material tends to be 
located in marginal spaces which become repositories 
for those things which are regarded as threatening the 
social body.
Active citizenship  voluntary action, often at the in-
stigation of governments, aimed at improving local 
communities.
Activism political activism that is strategic in nature and 
may go beyond conventional or formal political channels.
Agglomeration the concentration of productive activi-
ties in a particular region.
Agribusiness  large-scale, capital-intensive, agricul-
tural businesses incorporating supply, production and 
processing capacities.
Agri-food system the highly integrated system of agri-
cultural production which involves both upstream (e.g. 
suppliers) and downstream (e.g. processing) industries.
Alternative food networks a reaction to conventional 
(e.g. supermarket-dominated) food chains, in which 
local and/or organic foods are marketed through alter-
native outlets such as farmers’ markets, box schemes 
and home deliveries.
Anthropocentric a way of understanding the value of 
the environment which prioritizes humans as having the 
most value. In other words the environment is only use-
ful as a resource for humans. In this approach humans 
do not have any responsibility to ensure the environ-
mental sustainability of our actions.
Apartheid  the policy of spatial separation on racial 
grounds employed in South Africa under National Party 
rule between the late 1940s and early 1990s.
Appropriationism  the replacement of agricultural in-
puts with industrial alternatives. It forms a key process 
in the industrialization of the agri-food system.
B
Balance of payments (BOP)  the difference in value 
between a country’s inward and outward payments for 
goods, services and other transactions.
Glossary

492    Glossary
Branding an important means by which the worlds of 
the producer and the consumer are mediated; marketing 
and advertising that adds to a company’s goods stories 
of particular associations, awarenesses, loyalties, ori-
gins and perceived qualities. See commodity fetishism.
Brundtland Report published in 1987, it adopted the 
position that it was possible to pursue economic growth 
without compromising the environment and introduced 
the first widely used definition of sustainable develop-
ment: ‘development which meets the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability of future generations 
to meet their own needs’.
Buyer-driven commodity chain a chain in which the 
nature of production (e.g. salmon farming) is shaped or 
driven by powerful ‘downstream’ actors such as distrib-
utors and retailers.
C
CAP  Common Agricultural Policy of the European 
Union.
Capital money put into circulation or invested with the 
intent of generating more money. See Spotlight box 18.2.
Capitalism an historically specific economic system in 
which production and distribution are designed to ac-
cumulate capital and create profit. The system is charac-
terized by the separation of those who own the means of 
production from those who work for them.
Chiefdom social formation based on societies charac-
terized by the internal and unequal differentiation of 
both power and wealth and organized around the prin-
ciple of kinship. See Spotlight box 1.3.
Citizenship traditionally used to describe the relation-
ship between an individual and a nation-state, including 
what rights and duties he or she can expect. The defini-
tion now encompasses wider, more fluid and often con-
tested relationships with other political units.
City-states urban regions having political jurisdiction 
and control over a specific territory. A form of social 
organization associated with some of the earliest states.
Civic food networks food networks that are run and 
organised by civic groups (e.g., charities, NGOs).
Civilization  refers to an advanced form of social de-
velopment characterized by such things as urban life, 
commercial activity, writing systems and philosophical 
thought.
Class  social distinctions between groups of people 
linked to their material conditions and social status.
Clean development mechanism (CDM) a mechanism 
whereby industrialized countries can earn credits towards 
their own greenhouse gas reduction targets by investing 
in emission-reducing projects in the developing world. 
Part of the aim is to aid economic growth in developing 
countries without a commensurate increase in green-
house gas emissions. At the same time this benefits the 
industrialized countries; such assistance is often cheaper 
than reducing their own emissions.
Climate change a change in climate that is attributed 
directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the 
composition of the global atmosphere and which is in 
addition to natural climate variability observed over 
comparable time periods. Includes temperature rise, sea-
level rise, precipitation changes, droughts and floods.
Climate migration  a subset of environmental migra-
tion whereby persons or groups of persons are forced 
to move because of gradual changes in the natural en-
vironment, such as extreme weather events, droughts, 
water scarcity or sea-level rise (see also environmental 
migration).
Cluster a localized concentration of similar and inter-
linked economic activities.
Cold War a period extending from 1945 to the late 1980s 
during which two ideologically opposed blocs emerged 
within the world system, both with nuclear capabilities. 
The first was headed principally by the USA while the 
other was dominated by the Soviet Union.
Command economy  an economic system character-
ized by state-led central planning of economic activity 
combined with the simultaneous suppression of market-
type relations.
Commodity a good or service produced through the use 
of waged labour and sold in exchange for money.
Commodity fetishism how the relationships between 
the lives of commodities’ consumers and producers are 
made invisible by advertising imagery which places their 
meanings, values and qualities in other imagined geog-
raphies. See also follow the thing.
Communism a political theory attributed to the works of 
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Communism is charac-
terized by the common ownership of the means of produc-
tion. The foundations for full communism were supposed 
to be laid during a transitional period, known as social-
ism. The Soviet Union was the first state to be ruled by 
an avowedly communist government, from 1917 to 1991.
Community food scheme  a site of resistance to the 
industrialization of agriculture, in which the local com-
munity retains control and where consumers get sea-
sonal, fresh food at a price that supports farmers who 
use sustainable practices.
Comparative advantage  in economic geography, re-
fers to an advantage held by a nation or region in the 
production of a particular set of goods or services. See 
Spotlight box 14.4.

Glossary    493
Competitive advantage exists when a firm can deliver 
the same benefits as competitors but at lower cost (cost 
advantage). A firm may also deliver benefits that are 
greater than those of competing products (differentia-
tion advantage).
Conditional reserve  those (mineral or ore) deposits 
that have already been discovered but that are not eco-
nomic to work at present-day price levels with currently 
available extraction and production technologies.
Consumption a cultural-economic process; a placed and 
place-creating experience. The utilization of goods and 
services produced by economic processes, fostered by the 
retailing sector through marketing, advertising and brand-
ing. A process which, for every consumer, has a ‘back 
story’ – what shaped our buying of this or that – and an 
‘afterlife’ – how we actively use the things we buy. A pro-
cess implicated in many other aspects of our lives, includ-
ing our senses of self-identity and caring relationships with 
others near and far. A process involving not only shopping 
but also entanglements in sociotechnical systems that pro-
duce our heating and lighting, for example.
Contact zone the space in which transculturation takes 
place – where two different cultures meet and inform 
each other, often in highly asymmetrical ways.
Containment the Western strategy of encircling the So-
viet Union and its allies during the Cold War.
Core according to Wallerstein, the core refers to those 
regions of the capitalist world economy characterized 
by the predominance of core processes associated with 
relatively high wages, advanced technology and diversi-
fied production. See Spotlight box 2.1.
Counterurbanization  population increases in rural 
areas beyond the commuting range of major urban areas.
Cultural capital the possession of taste, style or attitude 
that can be converted, in many instances, into financial 
capital. In the post-industrial economy, where ideas are a 
global currency, cultural capital is a lucrative commodity.
Cultural dupe  a type of consumer described in some 
accounts as being pacified and seduced by advertising, 
an easily manipulated person following materialistic de-
sires. See also prosumer.
Culture  a system of shared meanings often based 
around such things as religion, language and ethnicity 
that can exist on a number of different spatial scales 
(local, regional, national, global, among communities, 
groups, or nations). Cultures are embodied in the ma-
terial and social world, and are dynamic rather than 
static, transforming through processes of cultural mix-
ing or transculturation. See Spotlight box 13.1.
Culture jamming tactics such as media hacking, infor-
mation warfare, ‘terror-art’ and graffiti, which aim to 
invest advertisements, newscasts and other media arte-
facts produced by powerful agencies and organizations 
with subversive meaning.

the 1970s as a pollutant, which is a probable human car-
cinogen and causes damage to internal organs.
De-coupled payments  subsidy payments made to 
farmers (e.g. CAP single farm payment) that are not 
linked to production levels.
Deep ecology An environmental approach which asks 
us to consider humans not only as part of nature but of 
equal value to non-human entities. This is a holistic vi-
sion whereby all human and non-human entities are in-
terconnected and interdependent. A holistic perspective 
enables us to understand that if we upset one element, it 
will have an impact on all other elements.
Defensive localism  a process where consumers pur-
chase local foods to support local farmers and the local 
economy, irrespective of their quality and whether they 
are produced organically or conventionally.
Deforestation the removal of forests from an area.
Deindustrialization refers to a relative decline in indus-
trial employment. It may also refer to an absolute de-
cline in industrial output as well as employment.
Demarginalization the process whereby a marginal or 
stigmatized space becomes ‘normalized’, and its popula-
tion incorporated into the mainstream.
Demographic transition model traces the shift from 
high birth and death rates to low ones.
Dependency  a viewpoint or theory of development 
which argues that global inequality is explained by the 
patterns of exploitation of the periphery by the capitalist 
core, established during the colonial period and perpetu-
ated by neo-colonial economic relations in recent times. 
The dependency theorists’ recommendation for poorer 
countries is to de-link from the global economy.
Dependency approaches explanations of the the eco-
nomic development of a state that are shaped by politi-
cal, economic or cultural influences that are external to 
that state. Typically dependency involves two sets of 
states described as dominant/dependent, centre/periph-
ery or metropolitan/satellite.
Depopulation  the reduction of population in an area 
through out-migration or a reduction in the birth rate 
below the death rate.
Derivatives contracts between two entities that specify 
rights/obligations based on (hence ‘derived’ from) the 

494    Glossary
performance of some other currency, commodity or 
service. They often include swaps, options, futures and 
mortgage-backed securities. They can be used to hedge 
against risk, or to provide leverage.
Diaspora literally, the scattering of a population; origi-
nally used to refer to the dispersal of Jews in AD 70, now 
used to refer to other population dispersals, voluntary and 
non-voluntary. Evokes a sense of exile and homelessness.
Diaspora space the spaces inhabited not only by those 
who have migrated and their descendants, but also by those 
who are conceptualized as indigenous or ‘native’. Similar 
to contact zone – a meeting point of different cultures.
Discourse social and cultural theorists understand dis-
course to be the dominant meanings that are attached to 
a linguistic term or utterance.
Displaced persons  refugees who have no obvious 
homeland.
Division of labour the separation of tasks in the pro-
duction process and their allocation to different groups

cerned with sustainable development.
Ecocatastrophism  the prediction of impending envi-
ronmental disasters, often as a result of human actions.
Ecocentrism a way of understanding the value of the 
environment which critiques the priorities of anthro-
pocentrism and suggests that non-human entities have 
intrinsic value.
Ecological democratization  an approach that sug-
gests that the only way to achieve environmentally sus-
tainable practices is to value participation and justice in 
environmental decision-making. Thus, this approach 
requires extensive citizen participation and the develop-
ment of democratic institutions to tackle environmental 
issues at all scales.
Ecological modernization an environmental manage-
ment approach that argues that economic growth does 
not need to be slowed to ensure environmental protec-
tion. It does not undermine the limits to growth thesis 
entirely, but suggests that we can ‘reorient’ economic 
growth and use technological solutions for environ-
mental problems, thus overcoming the environmental 
impact of growth. It is a very weak interpretation of 
sustainable development that allows for a reformist 
response where the current dominance of free-market 
capitalism is not challenged.
Economies of scale occur when mass production of a 
good (product) results in a lower average cost for each 
item. Economies of scale occur within a firm, such as 
using expensive equipment more intensively, or outside 
the firm as a result of its location, such as the availability 
of a local pool of skilled labour or good transport links.
Edge city (exopolis) a term referring to an area with 
city-like functions usually arising on the edge of an al-
ready urbanized area or conurbation and heavily de-
pendent on fast communications systems. Edge cities 
are regarded as symptomatic of the most recent phase 
of urbanization.
Electronic/digital money a payment system in which 
money is stored on a card and can be used to make, typi-
cally small, purchases, often simply by briefly holding 
the card at a contact point. Many universities and large 
companies use such cards in their canteens and for other 
services. Increasingly, public transport companies use 
these stored-value contactless smartcards as well, e.g. 
London’s Oyster Card.
Emerging markets refers to those markets that are per-
ceived to have a substantial growth potential. The term 
is often used in relation to selected countries of the for-
mer Soviet Union, Asia, Latin America and Africa.
Emotional labour workers are expected to display cer-
tain emotions, often in line with the goals of their em-
ployer or organization, as part of their job.

built up, often by force, under a supreme authority. Em-
pires usually involve rule over alien or subject peoples.
Energy mix the balance between various sources of en-
ergy in primary energy consumption.
Energy ratio the relationship between energy consump-
tion and economic growth in an economy:
Energy ratio =     Rate of change in energy consumption
	
Rate of change in economic growth (GDP)
A value greater than 1 indicates that the amount of en-
ergy required to create an additional unit of GDP is in-
creasing; a value less than 1 suggests the reverse.
Entitlements  the set of all commodity bundles over 
which a person can establish command given the legal, 
political, economic and social arrangements of the com-
munity in which they live.
Environmental Kuznets Curve  illustrates the hypo-
thetical relationship between measures of environmental 
degradation and per capita income. Shaped rather like 
an upside-down U, the curve shows environmental deg-
radation (e.g. pollution) increasing with rising wealth 
up to a certain point, beyond which higher income per 

Glossary    495
capita leads to a reversal of damage. There is evidence 
that this theory applies to some environmental problems 
but not others.
Environmental migration defined by the International 
Organization for Migration as persons or groups of per-
sons who, for compelling reasons of sudden or progres-
sive changes in the environment that adversely affect 
their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their 
habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily 
or permanently, and who move either within their coun-
try or abroad.
Environmentalism  a broad term incorporating the 
concerns and actions in aid of the protection and preser-
vation of the environment.
Ethical consumption where consumption is seen as a 
realm for political agency, a process that is not only gen-
erated by consumers being informed about the origins 
of commodities, but also by consumers’ diverse personal 
and collective histories of wider ethical reflection and 
behaviour. A process which looks to extend consump-
tion’s ‘close to home’ caring relationships to those mak-
ing the things we buy and share.
Ethnicity  refers to the process through which groups 
are recognized as possessing a distinct collective cultural 
identity. See also race and racism.

omized by McDonald’s, it is usually eaten out of the 
home and out of our hands.
Fertility rates the number of live births per thousand 
women of child-bearing age.
Feudalism a hierarchical social and political system com-
mon in Europe during the medieval period. The majority 
of the population were engaged in subsistence agriculture 
while simultaneously having an obligation to fulfil certain 
duties for the landholder. At the same time the landholder 
owed various obligations (fealty) to his overlord.
Financial exclusion the processes that prevent disad-
vantaged social groups from gaining access to the finan-
cial system.
Financialization refers to the growing influence of cap-
ital markets, their intermediaries and processes in con-
temporary economic and political life.

ate the social relationships between producers and con-
sumers by tracing the lives of individual commodities 
from farm to fork, from factory to home, etc. See also

patterns of international food production and consump-
tion and the developing capitalist system.
Food security when all people, at all times, have physi-
cal, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and 
nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food 
preferences for an active and healthy life.
Fordism  a regime of accumulation involving mass 
­production and consumption. Named after Henry Ford 
(1863–1947), Fordism is known for a differentiated 
­division of labour, assembly-line production and afford-
able mass-produced consumer goods.
Fordist or ‘organized’ capitalism a form of capitalism 
that reached its zenith during the period 1945 to 1973. 
It was characterized by the dominance of extractive 
and manufacturing industries, large-scale manufacture, 
mass-production and a significant level of state involve-
ment. See Spotlight box 3.1.
Foreclosure or repossession is a legal process in which 
a lender attempts to recover the balance of a mortgage 

496    Glossary

ated with major redevelopment and regeneration schemes.
Geographies of exclusion  the spatial processes by 
which a powerful grouping consciously seeks to dis-
tance itself from other less powerful groupings.

commonly associated with notions of deprivation, un-
employment and social exclusion.
Global cities  the term ‘global city’ was popularized 
by the sociologist Saskia Sassen in her 1991 book The 
Global City and is taken to refer to a small number of 
cities that serve as the command and control centres 
of the global economy. These cities possess a concen-
tration of financial and business services linked to the 
multinational corporations that control the activities and 
organization of the global economy, and which are often 
conspicuously clustered in their downtown business dis-
tricts. Global cities are also characterized by increasing 
social polarization as a result of a growing division in 
occupational and income opportunities, with growth in 
both high-skilled and low-skilled employment.
Global production networks  the extensive webs 
of intra-, inter- and extra-firm connections through 
which commodities are produced, distributed, sold and 
consumed.
Global warming an increase in the temperature of the 
Earth’s surface caused by trapping infrared radiation in 
carbon dioxide, increased amounts of which are pro-
duced by burning fossil fuels.
Globalized or ‘disorganized’ capitalism  a form of 
capitalism identifiable since the mid-1970s. It is char-
acterized by a relative decline in the importance of ex-
tractive and manufacturing industries, together with a 
relative increase in the importance of services. There is 
also an increasing tendency for the production process 
to be dominated by small-scale and flexible forms of or-
ganization. See Spotlight box 3.3.
Globalization a contested term relating to transforma-
tion of spatial relations that involves a change in the re-
lationship between space, economy and society.
GM See genetic modification.
Governance the way in which power operates through 
the relationships between different organizations.
Green revolution a large increase in crop production in 
developing countries achieved by the use of fertilizers, 
pesticides and high-yield crop varieties.
Greenhouse gases gases that trap thermal radiation 
in the Earth’s atmosphere, acting as a kind of blanket, 
leading to warming of the global climate system. Com-
mon greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane 
and nitrous oxide.
Gross domestic product (GDP) the value left after re-
moving the profits from overseas investments and those 
profits from the economy that go to foreign investors.
Gross national product (GNP) a broad measure of an 
economy’s performance; it is the value of the final out-
put of goods and services produced by the residents of 
an economy plus primary income from non-residential 
sources.
H
Heartland identified by the British geographer Halford 
Mackinder (1904) as the zone in East-Central Europe 
and Siberia, control of which would be a key to world 
domination. The term has since been appropriated by 
Latin American geopolitics.

Glossary    497
Hegemony  term derived from the work of Antonio 
Gramsci which refers to the ability of a dominant group 
to exert or maintain control through a combination of 
overt and subtle mechanisms.
Heritage according to UNESCO, ‘heritage is our legacy 
from the past, what we live with today, and what we 
pass on to future generations. Our cultural and natural 
heritage are both irreplaceable sources of life and inspira-
tion’. In human geography the focus is often on rural and 
urban heritage landscapes, frequently regarded as playing 
a formative role in the maintenance of national identity.
Heterogenization the way in which social forms that 
are conceived, controlled and put in place by cor-
porations – e.g. McDonald’s restaurants – become 
multiply localized in different places and cultures – 
e.g. McDonald’s in Russia. See also homogenization.
High-value foods includes such foods as fruit, vegeta-
bles, poultry and shellfish. World trade in high-value 
foods has increased markedly during the past two 
decades.
Homogenization  the effects that some academics say 
consumer culture has on places around the world. So-
cial forms conceived, controlled and put in place by 
corporations – e.g. McDonald’s restaurants – which are 
said to be the same wherever they are located. See also 
heterogenization.
Horizontal integration  occurs when two companies, 
within the same industry and at the same stage of pro-
duction, merge.
Hybridity  refers to groups as a mixture of local and 
non-local influences; their character and cultural attrib-
utes are a product of contact with the world beyond a 
local place. See Case study 13.4.
Hypersegregation  a term used to describe extreme 
residential segregation, such as that experienced by Afri-
can-Americans in the USA.
Hypothetical resources  those resources that might 
be expected to be found in the future in areas that have 
only been partially surveyed and developed.
I
Imaginary geographies the ideas and representations 
that divide the world into spaces with particular mean-
ings and associations. These exist on different scales 
(e.g. the imaginaries that divide the world into a de-
veloped core and less developed peripheries, or the im-
agined divide between the deprived inner city and the 
affluent suburbs).
Imperialism  a relationship of political, and/or eco-
nomic, and/or cultural domination and subordination 
between geographical areas.
Indigenous peoples those peoples native to a particu-
lar territory that was later colonized, particularly by 
Europeans.
Industrial revolution a term that is often taken to refer to 
the marked transformation of productive forces, initially 
within the British economic system, between the mid-
eighteenth and mid-nineteenth centuries. It resulted in the 
movement of Britain from a largely rural-based economy 
to one that was dominated by manufacturing and indus-
trial production. Such a transformation resulted in sub-
stantial social, political as well as economic changes.
Industrialization of agriculture  (see also agribusi-
ness) a process whereby methods commonly associated 
with the manufacturing industry are increasingly in-
corporated into farming, e.g. specialization of labour, 
­assembly-line production systems.
Infant mortality rate (IMR) number of deaths of per-
sons aged under 1 per 1,000 live births.
Informal economy those parts of the economy which 
operate beyond official recognition and outside formal 
systems of control and, often, of remuneration.
Informal settlements also known as shanty towns or 
squatter settlements, these are sections of a city where 
poor people have moved in, often illegally or unoffi-
cially, and have constructed improvised housing using 
informal means and scrap materials: often plywood cor-
rugated metal and sheets of plastic. They are usually 
built on the periphery of cities and often do not have 
proper sanitation, electricity, or other services. Informal 
settlements are mostly found in the major cities of devel-
oping nations in the global South and result from a com-
bination of intense rural to urban migration pressures 
coupled with a lack of provision of affordable housing 
for low-income urban households.

498    Glossary
Islamophobia  a prejudice against those who identify 
as Muslim, fuelled by post-9/11 discourses of Islamic 
fundamentalism and terrorist threat. Taking a variety 
of forms in the urban West, this can be interpreted as 
merely the latest inflection of a long-standing Orien-
talist discourse that contrasts Western democracy with 
Arab ‘barbarism’.
K

must sell their labour in order to live). It aims to replace 
capitalism with a fairer system, socialism maturing into 
communism.
Mega-cities giant metropolises with populations of at 
least 10 million people. Also used by Manuel Castells 
to describe large cities in which some people are con-
nected to global information flows while others are dis-
connected and information poor. This use of the term 
serves to highlight the problems associated with mega-

by problems such as slum housing, pollution and urban 
sprawl, but also often lack the economic and political 
power of global cities and therefore the resources to ad-
equately address their problems.
Merchant capitalism refers to an early phase of capi-
talist industrial development dominant in the larger 
urban regions of Europe from the late fifteenth century.

change.
Modernity refers to a period extending from the late 
sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries (in the case

often associated with capitalism and notions such as 
progress.
Monopoly  in theory, exists in an industry when one

ies between countries. In the United Kingdom, for ex-
ample, any one firm that has 25 per cent of the market is 
considered to hold a monopoly.
Monopsony in theory exists in an economy when one 
firm or individual purchases all of the output in a given

this imagined threat.
More developed countries (MDCs)  countries with 
significant competitive advantages in today’s globaliz-
ing economy. They have well-developed, increasingly 
knowledge-based and strongly interconnected manu-
facturing and service sectors that provide a significant 
proportion of employment and contribute to significant 
national and individual wealth. Indices such as literacy 
levels, incomes and quality of life are high and these 
countries exercise considerable political influence at 
the global scale. Examples are the United Kingdom, the 
United States, Germany and France.
Multiculturalism  refers to a belief or policy that en-
dorses the principle of cultural diversity and supports 
the right of different cultural and ethnic groups to re-
tain distinctive cultural identities. It has often been criti-
cized for being too symbolic and not politically radical 
enough in challenging racism.

the arguments set out by Thomas Malthus in the late 
eighteenth century.
New economic geography (NEG) an economic geog-
raphy that recognizes the importance of culture as an 
influence on economic processes and outcomes. In this

where there has been a relatively recent and significant 
shift away from primary activities towards manufactur-
ing production. Examples are South Korea and Mexico.
NGO non-governmental organization.
Non-governmental organization (NGO) an organiza-
tion formed by members of the public and one that has 
no government connections.
Non-renewable (stock) resources  those resources, 
mainly mineral, that have taken millions of years to 
form. Their availability is therefore finite as there is no 
possibility of their stock being replenished on a time-
scale of relevance to human society.
O

sources of a particular area will run out if the popula-
tion expands beyond a given point. Similar to the idea 
of a carrying capacity, that there is a limit beyond which 
environmental degradation occurs.

Age.
Participatory democracy  a form of governance that 
encourages involvement of all people in political deci-
sion-making, as opposed to representative democracy.
Passive solar heating the use of sunlight to heat build-
ings through building design. This involves collecting

glazing, using building materials with high heat storage 
capacity (e.g. brick walls and tile floors), and other de-
sign features that help to absorb and transmit heat, and 
protect from overheating.
Pastoral nomadism a form of social organization that 
is based on livestock husbandry for largely subsistence 
purposes. Pastoral nomads are characterized by a high 
level of mobility which allows them to search continu-
ally for new pastures in order to maintain their herds of 
animals.

500    Glossary
Patriarchy system of gendered power relations through 
which men exercise power over women.
Peasant the term has had a number of different inter-
pretations over the years and in different parts of the 
world. In general it usually refers to those individuals 
whose livelihood is largely dependent on the land and 
on rural subsistence-type activities. The term ‘peasant’ 
is usually reserved for those living in organized states, 
thus distinguishing them from band and tribal members, 
and so on.
Periphery according to Wallerstein, refers to those re-
gions of the world capitalist economy characterized by 
low wages, simple technology and limited production.
Peri-urban  those areas of land lying at the edge of 
urban areas and forming an interface between urban

acterised by the intermingling of rural and urban 
land uses. The term originates from the French word 
périurbanisation.
Permaculture  an environmental approach inspired 
by nature’s patterns to create sustainable human habi-
tats. It is based around three core principles – earth 
care (working with nature and designing systems that 
draw upon natural systems for inspiration), people care 
(looking after ourselves on a community and individual 
level through cooperation and mutual support) and 
fair shares (ensuring we only consume our share of the 
earth’s resources).

eclecticism.
Post-productivist transition a term used to describe 
the movement away from productivist agricultural

is characterized by extensive and diversified pat-
terns of farming and the growing importance of non-­
agricultural activities in the countryside, for example, 
recreation.
Poverty the condition of possessing an income insuffi-
cient to maintain a minimal standard of living. Defini-

to the social norms and expectations endemic to a given 
nation-state. However, the condition of absolute pov-
erty (i.e. lacking the income to maintain a minimum 
diet) is acknowledged worldwide.
Power geometry  the ways in which different social

bly linked to locality.
Quaternary sector  economic activities, mainly busi-
ness enterprises, involved with the processing and ex-
change of information.

posedly recognizable groups based predominantly on 
physical characteristics.
Racialized space the ways in which certain spaces are 
seen to be occupied exclusively or predominantly by a

culturally constructed ideas of difference.
Refugees persons who flee to a foreign country to es-
cape danger or persecution because of war, or religious 
or political reasons.
Relational approaches a term referring to a range of 
approaches that are concerned more with the network

siderable diversity between approaches, relational ap-
proaches focus primarily on the connections that exist 
between places and things. Particularly influential in re-
cent iterations of urban and economic geography.
Relocalization (of food) refers to the renewed inter-
est in foods of local and regional provenance, in which 
the link between ‘product’ and ‘place’ is emphasized 
and often formalized through a system of quality as-
surance or quality labels. Such locally distinctive qual-
ity food products are sold in regional and national 
markets.
Renewable energy  energy sources such as winds, 
waves and tides that are naturally replenished and can-
not be used up.

making to representatives often voted into positions of 
power by the broader public.
Residential segregation the ways in which, most ob-

where people live in areas divided along class or ethnic 
lines. In some instances this is conscious policy, in oth-
ers it results from the interaction of social and economic 
processes.
Resource a substance in the physical environment that 
has value or usefulness to human beings and is economi-
cally feasible and socially acceptable to use.
Retroliberalism an approach to economic policy visible 
in parts of the Western world in the 2010s that sees a re-
turn to classical liberal views concerning the central role

ernizing the infrastructure of the economy and increas-
ing the global reach of domestic corporations through 
trade diplomacy and aid.
Right to Food a human right recognised in the Univer-

food consistent with cultural traditions.
Romantic movement artistic, literary and philosophi-
cal movement that originated in the eighteenth century 
as a backlash against industrialization.
Rurality functionalist, critical political economy and so-
cial representation approach for distinguishing between 
rural and urban economy and society.
Rural–urban fringe  refers to the zone where rural 
and urban land uses meet and intermix around the 
edges of urban areas. While some regard the rural 
urban fringe as a transition zone between the city and 
the countryside, others argue that it represents a dis-
tinctive landscape type in its own right. This zone has 
long been regarded as problematic in planning and 
management terms. It is typically regarded as lacking 
aesthetic quality and being dominated by the func-
tional landscape elements of the urban infrastructure, 
the transport and distribution networks of the city and 
low-grade rural land.
S
Second global shift  offshoring of service functions; 
the first global shift involved the offshoring of manufac-
turing functions.

the Financial Conduct Authority (UK).
Securitization  the process of taking localized, non-
standard and opaque assets like mortgages and trans-
forming them into transparent and liquid securities that 
can be easily exchanged on global markets.
Semi-periphery according to Wallerstein, refers to those 
regions of the world capitalist economy which, while ex-

have as if it were a ‘real’ or a pre-social given.
Social constructionism  a sociological theory of 
knowledge which claims that meanings and truths are 
established socially through habitual use and institu-

truths as pre-given and objective, social constructionism 
recognises that individuals and groups participate in the 
creation of their realities through the way in which they 
perceive things and events.
Social embeddedness the idea that economic behav-
iour is embedded in, and mediated by, a complex and 
extensive web of social relations. Trust and regard are 
examples of such social relations.
Social exclusion the various ways in which people are 
excluded (economically, politically, socially, culturally) 
from the accepted norms within a society.

Structural adjustment programmes  loans designed 
to foster structural adjustment in LDCs by promoting 
market-led growth and a reduction in government inter-

Structuralism  a theory, evolved in Latin America in 
the 1940s and 1950s, which argues that the relative posi-
tion of a given economy vis-à-vis the global economy is 
a function of the nature of the manner of insertion of 
that economy historically. Changing the fortunes of an 
economy therefore requires state intervention to alter its 
structure.
Studentification an increase in the student population 
in a residential area, principally associated with student 
renting in the private sector, though also associated with 
newly built off-campus accommodation developed by 
private investors. A widely noted phenomenon in those 
countries where students in higher education tend to live

away from home, it is sometimes associated with gentri-
fication, but has markedly different social and environ-
mental outcomes.
Subculture a subdivision of a dominant culture or an 
enclave within it with a distinct integrated network of 
behaviour, beliefs and attitudes.
Substitutionism refers to the increased use of non-agri-

with poor credit or higher default risk, but also sold to 
borrowers with a good credit history.
Subprime mortgage loan to someone who may, as a 
result of unemployment or divorce for example, find it 
difficult to maintain regular repayments. These loans 
are offered on less favourable terms, such as a higher

cause many sub-prime loans were packaged into mort-
gage-backed securities that ultimately defaulted they 
contributed to the 2007 financial crisis.
Subsumption a process whereby an agribusiness TNC 
increases its control over farming by offering contracts 
to farmers to provide ‘raw materials’ for its food-manu-
facturing activities.
Suburbanization, suburbs suburbanization describes 
the growth of areas on the fringes of major cities. 
Whilst residents of metropolitan regions have often 
tended to work within the central urban area, they have 
frequently chosen to live in satellite communities called 
suburbs and commute to work via car or mass transit 
systems. Suburbs are therefore most frequently viewed 
as residential areas, either being part of a city or sepa-
rate residential communities within commuting dis-
tance of a city. In physical form they represent a mix of 
urban and rural elements and most have a lower popu-
lation density than inner city neighbourhoods. Often 
considered dull and homogeneous in character, more 
recently research has highlighted the diverse and chang-
ing nature of suburbs with an increasing range of urban 
populations and activities evident in outer or edge of 
city locations.
Sustainability, sustainable development  terms 
whose usage and meanings have grown exponen-
tially in recent years since their original discussion in 
the 1987 Brundtland Report. At their most basic they 
refer to the idea that development can continue in ways 
that respects the needs of future generations. There is 
considerable debate though concerning how sustain-
ability and these needs can be defined and measured. 
Often sustainability has come to refer to economic or 
social sustainability rather than just environmental 
sustainability. As sustainability discourses have prolif-
erated it is fair to say that the meaning of sustainabil-
ity and sustainable development have become less clear 
and subject to political manipulation. The terms have 
come to invoke a degree of cynicism amongst many 
radical/critical geographers.
Sustainable intensification This term is attributed to 
concerns about global food security. It evokes the idea 
that there is a need to achieve higher yields from the 
same acreage without damaging the environment. Ad-
vocates argue this can be achieved through science and 
technology innovations.
T
Territoriality a term used to describe an expression of 
ownership and control by an individual, group or state 
over a particular area of land in order to achieve par-
ticular ends.
Territory a recognizable region (area of land or sea) oc-
cupied and controlled by an individual, group or state.
Tertiary sector comprises economic activities engaged 
in enabling the exchange and consumption of goods and

Third World  a rather vague term used to describe 
those regions of the world in which levels of develop-
ment, as understood by such measures as GDP, are 
significantly below those of the economically more 
advanced regions. The term is increasingly seen as an 
inadequate description of the prevailing world situa-
tion since it disguises a significant amount of internal 
differentiation.
TNCs see transnational corporations.
Traceability in economic geography refers to the ability 
to determine the origin of agricultural foodstuffs.
Tradition an inherited, established or customary way of 
thinking, behaving or doing something, characteristic of 
persons in a particular family, group or society.
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership 
(TTIP) a proposed free trade and investment agreement 
between the European Union and the United States.
Transculturation  the ways in which subordinated or 
marginal groups select and invent from dominant cul-
tures; although such groups cannot control what ema-
nates from the dominant culture, they do determine to 
varying extents what they absorb into their own and 
what they use it for.
Transgression  a term describing actions that breach 
social expectations of what is appropriate in a particular 
place. Deliberate transgression may thus constitute an 
act of resistance.

504    Glossary
Transnational corporations (TNCs)  major business

ent historical periods. Often constructed in opposition to 
rural myths and implicated in moral debates about differ-
ent ways of life associated with the rural and the urban.
Urban revanchism literally, the process of ‘revenge’ by 
which middle-class citizens take back the city from the 
marginal groups whom they portray as taking it from 
them. In practice, this is promoted by urban policies pro-
moting law and order on the city streets and excluding 
those who do not fit in with the middle-class consumer 
ambience vital to the success of urban gentrification.
Urbanization  refers to the increasing importance of the 
urban relative to the total population. It is initially stimu-
