About the Author
Andrew Zimmerman Jones is the Physics Guide at About.com, 
a New York Times Company, where he writes and edits news 
and articles on all areas of physics. He spends his days working 
as an editor for an educational assessment company. He holds a 
bachelor’s degree in physics from Wabash College, where he also 
studied mathematics and philosophy, and a master’s degree in 
mathematical education from Purdue University.
In addition to work for About.com, Andrew has written a number 
of nonfiction essays and reviews, which have appeared in The 
Internet Review of Science Fiction, EpicSFF.com, Pink Floyd and 
Philosophy, Black Gate, and Heroes and Philosophy. His fiction 
credits include short stories in Abyss and Apex, KidVisions, The 
Four Bubbas of the Apocalypse, and International House of Bubbas.
He has been a member of Mensa since the eighth grade and has 
been intensely interested in both science and science fiction since 
even earlier. Along the way, he’s also become an Eagle Scout, a 
Master Mason in the Freemasons, and won the Harold Q. Fuller 
Prize in Physics at Wabash College. His plan for world domination 
nears completion with the publication of this book.
Andrew lives in central Indiana with his beautiful wife, Amber, 
and son, Elijah. When he’s not writing or editing, he is most often 
found reading, playing games, watching television, investigating 
bizarre scientific phenomena, or updating his personal Web page, 
which can be found at www.azjones.info. Andrew also regularly 
reports on any new string theory implications on his Web site at 
physics.about.com.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my loving and lovely wife, 
Amber Eckert-Jones. While physicists still search for a law to 
unify all of the forces in the physical universe, I don’t need to, 
because all the forces in my universe come together in you.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I must first profoundly thank my agent, Barb Doyen, for approaching 
me with this project. My deepest thanks and appreciations go out 
to the wonderful editorial staff at Wiley: Alissa Schwipps for her 
valuable input at every step in the process, Vicki Adang for her 
ability to turn my scientific babble into coherent explanations, and 
Stacy Kennedy for gathering together such a great team in the first 
place. I also very much appreciated the constructive and at times 
critical input of Dr. Rolf Schimmrigk of Indiana University, South 
Bend, who provided initial technical editing on the book.  In 
addition, I’m profoundly thankful for the extremely detailed 
technical expertise, review, and frequent discussions offered by 
Dr. Daniel Robbins of the Weinberg Theory Group at the University 
of Texas at Austin.
Without the wonderful staff at About.com, notably the Education 
Channel editor Madeleine Burry, I would never have had the 
opportunity to grow as a writer in this field. Also to author Robert 
J. Sawyer, for his mentorship and friendship over the years. 
Thanks to you all!
Many thanks to physicists Lee Smolin and John W. Moffat of the 
Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, Leonard Susskind of 
Stanford University, and Sylvester James Gates, director of the 
University of Maryland’s Center for String and Particle Theory, 
for e-mail exchanges that have helped to clarify various points 
throughout the writing of this book. 
Finally, my thanks go out to my wife, Amber, and son, Elijah, for 
putting up with me, even when I was driven frantic by deadlines. 
Thanks also to my mother, Nancy Zimmerman, and mother-in-law, 
Tina Lewis, for their help in keeping the family entertained while I 
worked feverishly in the basement.

Introduction
W
hy are scientists so excited about string theory? Because string 
theory is the most likely candidate for a successful theory of quantum 
gravity — a theory that scientists hope will unite two major physical laws of 
the universe into one. Right now, these laws (quantum physics and general 
relativity) describe two totally different types of behavior in totally differ­
ent ways, and in the realm where neither theory works completely, we really 
don’t know what’s going on!
Understanding the implications of string theory means understanding pro­
found aspects of our reality at the most fundamental levels. Are there paral­
lel universes? Is there only one law of nature or infinitely many? Why does 
our universe follow the laws it does? Is time travel possible? How many 
dimensions does our universe possess? Physicists are passionately seeking 
answers to these questions.
Indeed, string theory is a fascinating topic, a scientific revolution that prom­
ises to transform our understanding of the universe. As you’ll see, these sorts 
of revolutions have happened before, and this book helps you understand 
how physics has developed in the past, as well as how it may develop in the 
future.
This book contains some ideas that will probably, in the coming years, turn 
out to be completely false. It contains other ideas that may ultimately prove 
to be fundamental laws of our universe, perhaps forming the foundation for 
whole new forms of science and technology. No one knows what the future 
holds for string theory.
About This Book
In this book, I aim to give a clear understanding of the ever-evolving scien­
tific subfield known as string theory. The media is abuzz with talk about this 
“theory of everything,” and when you’re done with this book you should 
know what they’re talking about (probably better than they do, most of the 
time).

2
String Theory For Dummies 
In writing this book, I’ve attempted to serve several masters. First and fore­
most among them has been scientific accuracy, followed closely by entertain­
ment value. Along the way, I’ve also done my best to use language that you 
can understand no matter your scientific background, and I’ve certainly tried 
to keep any mathematics to a minimum.
In writing this book, I set out to achieve the following goals:
	
✓	Provide the information needed to understand string theory (including 
established physics concepts that predate string theory).
	
✓	Establish the successes of string theory so far.
	
✓	Lay out the avenues of study that are attempting to gain more evidence 
for string theory.
	
✓	Explore the bizarre (and speculative) implications of string theory.
	
✓	Present the critical viewpoints in opposition to string theory, as well as 
some alternatives that may bear fruit if it proves to be false.
	
✓	Have some fun along the way.
	
✓	Avoid mathematics at all costs. (You’re welcome!)
I hope you, good reader, find that I’ve been successful at meeting these goals.
And while time may flow in only one direction (Or does it? I explore this in 
Chapter 16), your reading of this book may not. String theory is a complex 
scientific topic that has a lot of interconnected concepts, so jumping between 
concepts is not quite as easy as it may be in some other For Dummies ref­
erence books. I’ve tried to help you out by including quick reminders and 
providing cross-references to other chapters where necessary. So feel free 
to wander the pages to your heart’s content, knowing that if you get lost you 
can work your way back to the information you need.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things con­
sistent and easy to understand:
	
✓	I use monofont for Web sites. Note: When this book was printed, some 
Web addresses may have needed to break across two lines of text. If that 
happened, rest assured that I haven’t put in any extra characters (such 
as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using one of these Web 
addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, as though the 
line break doesn’t exist.

3
 Introduction
	
✓	I’ve done my best not to fill the book with technical jargon, which is 
hard to do in a book on one of the most complex and mathematically 
driven scientific topics of all time. When I use a technical term, it’s in 
italics and closely followed by an easy-to-understand definition.
	
✓	Bold is used to highlight key words and phrases in bulleted lists.
Finally, one major convention used in this book is in the title: I use the term 
“string theory.” In Chapter 10, you discover that string theory is actually 
called superstring theory. As you see in Chapter 11, in 1995 physicists real­
ized that the various “string theories” (five existed at the time) included 
objects other than strings, called branes. So, strictly speaking, calling it by 
the name “string theory” is a bit of a misnomer, but people (including string 
theorists themselves) do it all the time, so I’m treading on safe ground. Many 
physicists also use the name M-theory to describe string theory after 1995 
(although they rarely agree on what the “M” stands for), but, again, I will 
mostly refer to it just as “string theory” unless the distinction between differ­
ent types matters.
What You’re Not to Read
All the chapters provide you with important information, but some sections 
offer greater detail or tidbits of information that you can skip for now and 
come back to later without feeling guilty:
	
✓	Sidebars: Sidebars are shaded boxes that give detailed examples or 
explore a tangent in more detail. Ignoring these won’t compromise your 
understanding of the rest of the material.
	
✓	Anything with a Technical Stuff icon: This icon indicates information 
that’s interesting but that you can live without. Read these tidbits later if 
you’re pressed for time.
Foolish Assumptions
About the only assumption that I’ve made in writing this book is that you’re 
reading it because you want to know something about string theory. I’ve tried 
to not even assume that you enjoy reading physics books. (I do, but I try not 
to project my own strangeness on others.)
I have assumed that you have a passing acquaintance with basic physics 
concepts — maybe you took a physics class in high school or have watched 
some of the scientific programs about gravity, light waves, black holes, or 
other physics-related topics on cable channels or your local PBS station. 
You don’t need a degree in physics to follow the explanations in this book, 

4
String Theory For Dummies 
although without a degree in physics you might be amazed that anyone can 
make sense of any theory this disconnected from our everyday experience. 
(Even with physics degree, it can boggle the mind.)
As is customary in string theory books for the general public, the mathemat­
ics has been avoided. You need a graduate degree in mathematics or physics 
to follow the mathematical equations at the heart of string theory, and while 
I have a graduate degree in mathematics, I’ve assumed that you don’t. Don’t 
worry — while a complete understanding of string theory is rooted firmly 
in the advanced mathematical concepts of quantum field theory, I’ve used a 
combination of text and figures to explain the fascinating ideas behind string 
theory.
How This Book Is Organized
String Theory For Dummies is written so you can easily get to the information 
you need, read it, and understand it. It’s designed to follow the historical 
development of the theory as much as possible, though many of the concepts 
in string theory are interconnected. Although I’ve attempted to make each 
chapter understandable on its own, I’ve included cross-references where con­
cepts repeat to get you back to a more thorough discussion of them.
Part I: Introducing String Theory
This first part of the book introduces the key concepts of string theory in a 
very general way. You read about why scientists are so excited about finding 
a theory of quantum gravity. Also, you get your first glimpse into the suc­
cesses and failures of string theory.
Part II: The Physics Upon Which 
String Theory Is Built
String theory is built upon the major scientific developments of the first 
70 years or so of the 20th century. In this part, you find out how physicists 
(and scientists in general) learn things and what they’ve learned so far. Part 
II includes chapters on how science develops, classical physics (before 
Einstein), Einstein’s theory of relativity, quantum physics, and the more 
recent findings in particle physics and cosmology. The questions raised in 
these chapters are those that string theory attempts to answer.

 Introduction
Part III: Building String Theory: 
A Theory of Everything
You get to the heart of the matter in this part. I discuss the creation and 
development of string theory, from 1968 to early 2009. The amazing transfor­
mations of this theory are laid out here. Chapter 12 focuses on ways that the 
concepts of string theory can be tested.
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory 
on the Boundaries of Knowledge
Here I take string theory out for a spin in the universe, exploring some of the 
major concepts in greater detail. Chapter 13 focuses on the concept of extra 
dimensions, which are at the core of much of string theory study. Chapter 14 
explores the implications for cosmology and how string theory could explain 
certain properties of our universe. Even more amazing, in Chapters 15 and 
16, you discover what string theory has to say about possible parallel uni­
verses and the potential for time travel.
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: 
Criticism and Alternatives
The discussion gets heated in this part as you read about the criticisms of 
string theory. String theory is far from proven, and many scientists feel that 
it’s heading in the wrong direction. Here you find out why and see what alter­
natives they’re posing, such as loop quantum gravity (string theory’s biggest 
competitor). If string theory is wrong, scientists will continue to look for 
answers to the questions that it seeks to resolve.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In the For Dummies tradition, the final chapters of this book present lists of 
ten topics. Chapter 20 sums up ten outstanding physics questions that scien­
tists hope any “theory of everything” (including string theory) will answer. 
Chapter 21 focuses on ten string theorists who have done a lot to advance 
the field, either through their own research or by introducing string theory 
concepts to the world through popular books.

String Theory For Dummies 
Icons Used in this Book
Throughout the book, you’ll find icons in the margins that are designed to 
help you navigate the text. Here’s what these icons mean:
	
Although everything in this book is important, some information is more 
important than other information. This icon points out information that will 
definitely be useful later in the book.
	
In science, theories are often explained with analogies, thought experiments, 
or other helpful examples that present complex mathematical concepts in a 
way that is more intuitively understandable. This icon indicates that one of 
these examples or hints is being offered.
	
Sometimes I go into detail that you don’t need to know to follow the basic dis­
cussion and is a bit more technical (or mathematical) than you may be inter­
ested in. This icon points out that information, which you can skip without 
losing the thread of the discussion.
Where to Go from Here
The For Dummies books are organized in such a way that you can surf 
through any of the chapters and find useful information without having to 
start at Chapter 1. I (naturally) encourage you to read the whole book, but 
this structure makes it very easy to start with the topics that interest you 
the most.
If you have no idea what string theory is, then I recommend looking at 
Chapter 1 as a starting point. If your physics is rusty, pay close attention to 
Chapters 5–9, which cover the history and current status of the major phys­
ics concepts that pop up over and over again.
If you’re familiar with string theory but want some more details, jump 
straight to Chapters 10 and 11, where I explain how string theory came about 
and reached its current status. Chapter 12 offers some ways of testing the 
theory, while Chapters 13–16 take concepts from string theory and apply 
them to some fascinating topics in theoretical physics.
Some of you, however, may want to figure out what all the recent fuss is with 
people arguing across the blogosphere about string theory. For that, I recom­
mend jumping straight to Chapter 17, which addresses some of the major 
criticisms of string theory. Chapters 18 and 19 focus heavily on other theo­
ries that may either help expand or replace string theory, so they’re a good 
place to go from there.

eet string theory, a bold scientific theory that 
attempts to reconcile all the physical properties of 
our universe into a single unified and coherent mathemati­
cal framework.
String theory’s goal is to make quantum physics and 
Einstein’s theory of gravity (called general relativity) play 
nice. In this part, I explain why scientists want to find a 
theory of quantum gravity, and then I review the successes 
and failures at applying string theory to this search.
This part is something of an overview for the entire book, 
so stick with me. The foundation laid here may help 
explain the entire universe.

S
tring theory is a work in progress, so trying to pin down exactly what 
string theory is, or what the fundamental elements are, can be kind of 
tricky. Regardless, that’s exactly what I try to do in this chapter.
In this chapter, you gain a basic understanding of string theory. I outline the 
key elements of string theory, which provide the foundation for most of this 
book. I also discuss the possibility that string theory could be the starting 
point for a “theory of everything,” which would define all of our universe’s 
physical laws in one simple (or not so simple) mathematical formula. Finally, 
I look at the reasons why you should care about string theory.
String Theory: Seeing What Vibrating 
Strings Can Tell Us about the Universe
String theory is a physics theory that the universe is composed of vibrating fil­
aments of energy, expressed in precise mathematical language. These strings 
of energy represent the most fundamental aspect of nature. The theory also 
predicts other fundamental objects, called branes. All of the matter in our uni­
verse consists of the vibrations of these strings (and branes). One important 
result of string theory is that gravity is a natural consequence of the theory, 
which is why scientists believe that string theory may hold the answer to 
possibly uniting gravity with the other forces that affect matter.

10
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
	
Let me reiterate something important: String theory is a mathematical theory. 
It’s based on mathematical equations that can be interpreted in certain ways. 
If you’ve never studied physics before, this may seem odd, but all physical 
theories are expressed in the language of mathematics. In this book, I avoid 
the mathematics and try to get to the heart of what the theory is telling us 
about the physical universe.
	
At present, no one knows exactly what the final version of string theory will 
look like. Scientists have some vague notions about the general elements 
that will exist within the theory, but no one has come up with the final equa­
tion that represents all of string theory in our universe, and experiments 
haven’t yet been able to confirm it (though they haven’t successfully refuted 
it, either). Physicists have created simplified versions of the equation, but it 
doesn’t quite describe our universe . . . yet.
Using tiny and huge concepts to 
create a theory of everything
String theory is a type of high-energy theoretical physics, practiced largely 
by particle physicists. It’s a quantum field theory (see the sidebar “What is 
quantum field theory?”) that describes the particles and forces in our uni­
verse based on the way that special extra dimensions within the theory are 
wrapped up into a very small size (a process called compactification). This 
is the power of string theory — to use the fundamental strings, and the way 
extra dimensions are compactified, to provide a geometric description of all 
the particles and forces known to modern physics.
Among the forces needed to be described is, of course, gravity. Because 
string theory is a quantum field theory, this means that string theory would 
be a quantum theory of gravity, known as quantum gravity. The established 
theory of gravity, general relativity, has a fluid, dynamic space-time, and one 
aspect of string theory that’s still being worked on is getting this sort of a 
space-time to emerge out of the theory.
The major achievements of string theory are concepts you can’t see, unless 
you know how to interpret the physics equations. String theory uses no 
experiments that provide new insights, but it has revealed profound math­
ematical relationships within the equations, which lead physicists to believe 
that they must be true. These properties and relationships — called by 
jargon such as various symmetries and dualities, the cancellation of anoma­
lies, and the explanation of black hole entropy — are described in Chapters 
10 and 11.

11
 Chapter 1: So What Is String Theory Anyway?
In recent years, there has been much public controversy over string theory, 
waged across headlines and the Internet. These issues are addressed in Part 
V, but they come down to fundamental questions about how science should 
be pursued. String theorists believe that their methods are sound, while the 
critics believe that they are, at best, questionable. Time and experimental 
evidence will tell which side has made the better argument.
A quick look at where 
string theory has been
The theory was originally developed in 1968 as a theory that attempted to 
explain the behavior of hadrons (such as protons and neutrons, the particles 
that make up an atomic nucleus) inside particle accelerators. Physicists later 
realized this theory could also be used to explain some aspects of gravity.
For more than a decade, string theory was abandoned by most physicists, 
mainly because it required a large number of extra, unseen dimensions. It 
rose to prominence again in the mid-1980s, when physicists were able to 
prove it was a mathematically consistent theory.
In the mid-1990s, string theory was updated to become a more complex 
theory, called M-theory, which contains more objects than just strings. These 
new objects were called branes, and they could have anywhere from zero to 
nine dimensions. The earlier string theories (which now also include branes) 
were seen as approximations of the more complete M-theory.
What is quantum field theory?
Physicists use fields to describe the things that 
don’t just have a particular position, but exist at 
every point in space. For example, you can think 
about the temperature in a room as a field — 
it may be different near an open window than 
near a hot stove, and you could imagine mea­
suring the temperature at every single point in 
the room. A field theory, then, is a set of rules 
that tell you how some field will behave, such 
as how the temperature in the room changes 
over time.
In Chapters 7 and 8, you find out about one of 
the most important achievements of the 20th 
century: the development of quantum theory. 
This refers to principles that lead to seemingly 
bizarre physical phenomena, which nonethe­
less seem to occur in the subatomic world.
When you combine these two concepts, you get 
quantum field theory: a field theory that obeys 
the principles of quantum theory. All modern 
particle physics is described by quantum field 
theories.

12
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
	
Technically, the modern M-theory is more than the traditional string theory, 
but the name “string theory” is still often used for M-theory and its various 
offspring theories. (Even the original superstring theories have been shown to 
include branes.) My convention in this book is to refer to theories that contain 
branes, which are variants of M-theory and the original string theories, using 
the term “string theory.”
Introducing the Key Elements 
of String Theory
Five key ideas are at the heart of string theory and come up again and again. 
It’s best for you to become familiar with these key concepts right off the bat:
	
✓	String theory predicts that all objects in our universe are composed of 
vibrating filaments (and membranes) of energy.
	
✓	String theory attempts to reconcile general relativity (gravity) with 
quantum physics.
	
✓	String theory provides a way of unifying all the fundamental forces of the 
universe.
	
✓	String theory predicts a new connection (called supersymmetry) between 
two fundamentally different types of particles, bosons and fermions.
	
✓	String theory predicts a number of extra (usually unobservable) dimen­
sions to the universe.
I introduce you to the very basics of these ideas in the following sections.
Strings and branes
When the theory was originally developed in the 1970s, the filaments of 
energy in string theory were considered to be 1-dimensional objects: strings. 
(One-dimensional indicates that a string has only one dimension, length, as 
opposed to say a square, which has both length and height dimensions.)
These strings came in two forms — closed strings and open strings. An open 
string has ends that don’t touch each other, while a closed string is a loop 
with no open end. It was eventually found that these early strings, called 
Type I strings, could go through five basic types of interactions, as shown in 
Figure 1-1.

13
 Chapter 1: So What Is String Theory Anyway?
	
Figure 1-1: 
Type I 
strings can 
go through 
five fun-
damental 
interactions, 
based on 
different 
ways of 
joining and 
splitting.
	
	
The interactions are based on a string’s ability to have ends join and split 
apart. Because the ends of open strings can join together to form closed 
strings, you can’t construct a string theory without closed strings.
	
This proved to be important, because the closed strings have properties that 
make physicists believe they might describe gravity! In other words, instead of 
just being a theory of matter particles, physicists began to realize that string 
theory may just be able to explain gravity and the behavior of particles.
Over the years, it was discovered that the theory required objects other 
than just strings. These objects can be seen as sheets, or branes. Strings can 
attach at one or both ends to these branes. A 2-dimensional brane (called a 
2-brane) is shown in Figure 1-2. (See Chapter 11 for more about branes.)

Quantum gravity
Modern physics has two basic scientific laws: quantum physics and general 
relativity. These two scientific laws represent radically different fields of 
study. Quantum physics studies the very smallest objects in nature, while 
relativity tends to study nature on the scale of planets, galaxies, and the uni­
verse as a whole. (Obviously, gravity affects small particles too, and relativity 
accounts for this as well.) Theories that attempt to unify the two theories 
are theories of quantum gravity, and the most promising of all such theories 
today is string theory.
The closed strings of string theory (see the preceding section) correspond 
to the behavior expected for gravity. Specifically, they have properties that 
match the long sought-after graviton, a particle that would carry the force of 
gravity between objects.
Quantum gravity is the subject of Chapter 2, where I cover this idea in much 
greater depth.
Unification of forces
Hand-in-hand with the question of quantum gravity, string theory attempts 
to unify the four forces in the universe — electromagnetic force, the strong 
nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and gravity — together into one uni­
fied theory. In our universe, these fundamental forces appear as four differ­
ent phenomena, but string theorists believe that in the early universe (when 
there were incredibly high energy levels) these forces are all described 
by strings interacting with each other. (If you’ve never heard of some of 
these forces, don’t worry! They’re individually discussed in greater detail in 
Chapter 2 and throughout Part II.)

15
 Chapter 1: So What Is String Theory Anyway?
Supersymmetry
All particles in the universe can be divided into two types: bosons and fer­
mions. (These types of particles are explained in more detail in Chapter 8.) 
String theory predicts that a type of connection, called supersymmetry, exists 
between these two particle types. Under supersymmetry, a fermion must 
exist for every boson and a boson for every fermion. Unfortunately, experi­
ments have not yet detected these extra particles.
Supersymmetry is a specific mathematical relationship between certain 
elements of physics equations. It was discovered outside of string theory, 
although its incorporation into string theory transformed the theory into 
supersymmetric string theory (or superstring theory) in the mid-1970s. (See 
Chapter 10 for more specifics about supersymmetry.)
One benefit of supersymmetry is that it vastly simplifies string theory’s 
equations by allowing certain terms to cancel out. Without supersymmetry, 
the equations result in physical inconsistencies, such as infinite values and 
imaginary energy levels.
Because scientists haven’t observed the particles predicted by supersym­
metry, this is still a theoretical assumption. Many physicists believe that the 
reason no one has observed the particles is because it takes a lot of energy to 
generate them. (Energy is related to mass by Einstein’s famous E = mc2 equa­
tion, so it takes energy to create a particle.) They may have existed in the 
early universe, but as the universe cooled off and energy spread out after the 
big bang, these particles would have collapsed into the lower-energy states 
that we observe today. (We may not think of our current universe as particu­
larly low energy, but compared to the intense heat of the first few moments 
after the big bang, it certainly is.)
	
In other words, the strings vibrating as higher-energy particles lost energy and 
transformed from one type of particle (one type of vibration) into another, 
lower-energy type of vibration.
Scientists hope that astronomical observations or experiments with particle 
accelerators will uncover some of these higher-energy supersymmetric par­
ticles, providing support for this prediction of string theory.
Extra dimensions
Another mathematical result of string theory is that the theory only makes 
sense in a world with more than three space dimensions! (Our universe has 
three dimensions of space — left/right, up/down, and front/back.) Two pos­
sible explanations currently exist for the location of the extra dimensions:

16
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
	
✓	The extra space dimensions (generally six of them) are curled up (com­
pactified, in string theory terminology) to incredibly small sizes, so we 
never perceive them.
	
✓	We are stuck on a 3-dimensional brane, and the extra dimensions extend 
off of it and are inaccessible to us.
A major area of research among string theorists is on mathematical models 
of how these extra dimensions could be related to our own. Some of these 
recent results have predicted that scientists may soon be able to detect 
these extra dimensions (if they exist) in upcoming experiments, because 
they may be larger than previously expected. (See Chapter 13 for more about 
extra dimensions.)
Understanding the Aim of String Theory
To many, the goal of string theory is to be a “theory of everything” — that 
is, to be the single physical theory that, at the most fundamental level, 
describes all of physical reality. If successful, string theory could explain 
many of the fundamental questions about our universe.
Explaining matter and mass
One of the major goals of current string theory research is to construct a 
solution of string theory that contains the particles that actually exist in our 
universe.
String theory started out as a theory to explain particles, such as hadrons, 
as the different higher vibrational modes of a string. In most current formula­
tions of string theory, the matter observed in our universe comes from the 
lowest-energy vibrations of strings and branes. (The higher-energy vibrations 
represent more energetic particles that don’t currently exist in our universe.)
The mass of these fundamental particles comes from the ways that these 
string and branes are wrapped in the extra dimensions that are compactified 
within the theory, in ways that are rather messy and detailed.
For an example, consider a simplified case where the extra dimensions are 
curled up in the shape of a donut (called a torus by mathematicians and phys­
icists), as in Figure 1-3.

17
 Chapter 1: So What Is String Theory Anyway?
	
Figure 1-3: 
Strings 
wrap 
around 
extra dimen-
sions to 
create par-
ticles with 
different 
masses.
	
Heavy particle
Light particle
A string has two ways to wrap once around this shape:
	
✓	A short loop around the tube, through the middle of the donut
	
✓	A long loop wrapping around the entire length of the donut (like a string 
wraps around a yo-yo)
	
The short loop would be a lighter particle, while the long loop is a heavier par­
ticle. As you wrap strings around the torus-shaped compactified dimensions, 
you get new particles with different masses.
	
One of the major reasons that string theory has caught on is that this idea — 
that length translates into mass — is so straightforward and elegant. The com­
pactified dimensions in string theory are much more elaborate than a simple 
torus, but they work the same way in principle.
It’s even possible (though harder to visualize) for a string to wrap in both 
directions simultaneously — which would, again, give yet another particle 
with yet another mass. Branes can also wrap around extra dimensions, creat­
ing even more possibilities.
Defining space and time
In many versions of string theory, the extra dimensions of space are compac­
tified into a very tiny size, so they’re unobservable to our current technology. 
Trying to look at space smaller than this compactified size would provide 
results that don’t match our understanding of space-time. (As you see in 
Chapter 2, the behavior of space-time at these small scales is one of the rea­
sons for a search for quantum gravity.) One of string theory’s major obsta­
cles is attempting to figure out how space-time can emerge from the theory.

18
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
As a rule, though, string theory is built upon Einstein’s notion of space-time 
(see Chapter 6). Einstein’s theory has three space dimensions and one time 
dimension. String theory predicts a few more space dimensions but doesn’t 
change the fundamental rules of the game all that much, at least at low 
energies.
	
At present, it’s unclear whether string theory can make sense of the funda­
mental nature of space and time any more than Einstein did. In string theory, 
it’s almost as if the space and time dimensions of the universe are a backdrop 
to the interactions of strings, with no real meaning on their own.
Some proposals have been developed for how this might be addressed, 
mainly focusing on space-time as an emergent phenomenon — that is, the 
space-time comes out of the sum total of all the string interactions in a way 
that hasn’t yet been completely worked out within the theory.
However, these approaches don’t meet some physicists’ definition, leading 
to criticism of the theory. String theory’s largest competitor, loop quantum 
gravity, uses the quantization of space and time as the starting point of its 
own theory, as Chapter 18 explains. Some believe that this will ultimately be 
another approach to the same basic theory.
Quantizing gravity
The major accomplishment of string theory, if it’s successful, will be to show 
that it’s a quantum theory of gravity. The current theory of gravity, general 
relativity, doesn’t allow for the results of quantum physics. Because quantum 
physics places limitations on the behavior of small objects, it creates major 
inconsistencies when trying to examine the universe at extremely small 
scales. (See Chapter 7 for more on quantum physics.)
Unifying forces
Currently, four fundamental forces (more precisely called “interactions” 
among physicists) are known to physics: gravity, electromagnetic force, weak 
nuclear force, and strong nuclear force. String theory creates a framework in 
which all four of these interactions were once a part of the same unified force 
of the universe.
Under this theory, as the early universe cooled off after the big bang, this uni­
fied force began to break apart into the different forces we experience today. 
Experiments at high energies may someday allow us to detect the unification 
of these forces, although such experiments are well outside of our current 
realm of technology.

19
 Chapter 1: So What Is String Theory Anyway?
 Appreciating the Theory’s Amazing 
(and Controversial) Implications
Although string theory is fascinating in its own right, what may prove to be 
even more intriguing are the possibilities that result from it. These topics are 
explored in greater depth throughout the book and are the focus of Parts III 
and IV.
Landscape of possible theories
One of the most unexpected and disturbing discoveries of string theory is 
that instead of one single theory, it turns out there may be a huge number 
of possible theories (or, more precisely, possible solutions to the theory) — 
possibly as many as 10500 different solutions! (That’s a 1 followed by 500 
zeroes!) While this huge number has prompted a crisis among some string 
theorists, others have embraced this as a virtue, claiming that this means 
that string theory is very rich. In order to wrap their minds around so many 
possible theories, some string theorists have turned toward the anthropic 
principle, which tries to explain properties of our universe as a result of our 
presence in it. Still others have no problem with this vast number, actually 
having expected it and, instead of trying to explain it, just trying to measure 
the solution that applies to our universe.
With such a large number of theories available, the anthropic principle allows 
a physicist to use the fact that we’re here to choose among only those theo­
ries that have physical parameters that allow us to be here. In other words, 
our very presence dictates the choice of physical law — or is it merely that 
our presence is an observable piece of data, like the speed of light?
	
The use of the anthropic principle is one of the most controversial aspects 
of modern string theory. Even some of the strongest string theory support­
ers have expressed concern over its application, because of the sordid (and 
somewhat unscientific) applications to which it has been used in the past and 
their feeling that all that is needed is an observation of our universe, without 
anything anthropic applied at all.
As anthropic principle skeptics are quick to point out, physicists only adopt 
the anthropic principle when they have no other options, and they abandon 
it if something better comes along. It remains to be seen if string theorists 
will find another way to maneuver through the string theory landscape. 
(Chapter 11 has more details about the anthropic principle.)

20
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
Parallel universes
Some interpretations of string theory predict that our universe is not the only 
one. In fact, in the most extreme versions of the theory, an infinite number 
of other universes exist, some of which contain exact duplicates of our own 
universe.
As wild as this theory is, it’s predicted by current research studying the very 
nature of the cosmos itself. In fact, parallel universes aren’t just predicted by 
string theory — one view of quantum physics has suggested the theoretical 
existence of a certain type of parallel universe for more than half a century. 
In Chapter 15, I explore the scientific concept of parallel universes in greater 
detail.
Wormholes
Einstein’s theory of relativity predicts warped space called a wormhole (also 
called an Einstein-Rosen bridge). In this case, two distant regions of space are 
connected by a shorter wormhole, which gives a shortcut between those two 
distant regions, as shown in Figure 1-4.
	
Figure 1-4: 
Space can 
warp itself 
into a 
wormhole.
	
String theory allows for the possibility that wormholes extend not only 
between distant regions of our own universe, but also between distant 
regions of parallel universes. Perhaps universes that have different physical 
laws could even be connected by wormholes. (Chapters 15 and 16 contain 
more info on wormholes.)
In fact, it’s not clear whether wormholes will exist within string theory at all. 
As a quantum gravity theory, it’s possible that the general relativity solutions 
that give rise to potential wormholes might go away.

21
 Chapter 1: So What Is String Theory Anyway?
The universe as a hologram
In the mid-1990s, two physicists came up with an idea called the holographic 
principle. In this theory, if you have a volume of space, you can take all the 
information contained in that space and show that it corresponds to infor­
mation “written” on the surface of the space. As odd as it seems, this holo­
graphic principle may be key in resolving a major mystery of black holes that 
has existed for more than 20 years!
Many physicists believe that the holographic principle will be one of the 
fundamental physical principles that will allow insights into a greater under­
standing of string theory. (Check out Chapter 11 for more on the holographic 
principle.)
Time travel
Some physicists believe that string theory may allow for multiple dimen­
sions of time (by no means the dominant view). As our understanding of 
time grows with string theory, it’s possible that scientists may discover new 
means of traveling through the time dimension or show that such theoreti­
cal possibilities are, in fact, impossible, as most physicists believe. (Flip to 
Chapter 16 if you’re ready to make your time travel reservation.)
The big bang
String theory is being applied to cosmology, which means that it may give us 
insights into the formation of the universe. The exact implications are still 
being explored, but some believe that string theory supports the current cos­
mological model of inflation, while others believe it allows for entirely univer­
sal creation scenarios.
Inflation theory predicts that, very shortly after the original big bang, the uni­
verse began to undergo a period of rapid, exponential inflation. This theory, 
which applies principles of particle physics to the early universe as a whole, 
is seen by many as the only way to explain some properties of the early 
universe.
In string theory, there also exists a possible alternate model to our current 
big bang model in which two branes collided together and our universe is the 
result. In this model, called the ekpyrotic universe, the universe goes through 
cycles of creation and destruction, over and over. (Chapter 14 covers the big 
bang theory and the ekpyrotic universe.)

22
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
The end of the universe
The ultimate fate of the universe is a question that physics has long explored, 
and a final version of string theory may help us ultimately determine the 
matter density and cosmological constant of the universe. By determining 
these values, cosmologists will be able to determine whether our universe 
will ultimately contract in upon itself, ending in a big crunch — and perhaps 
start all over again. (See Chapter 14 for more on these speculations.)
Why Is String Theory So Important?
String theory yields many fascinating subjects for thought, but you may be 
wondering about the practical importance of it. For one thing, string theory is 
the next step in our growing understanding of the universe. If that’s not prac­
tical enough, then there’s this consideration: Your tax money goes to fund 
scientific research, and the people trying to get that money want to use it to 
study string theory (or its alternatives).
A completely honest string theorist would be forced to say that there are 
probably no practical applications for string theory, at least in the foresee­
able future. This doesn’t look that great on either the cover of a book or a 
magazine column, so it gets spiced up with talk about parallel universes, 
extra time dimensions, and discovering new fundamental symmetries of 
nature. They might exist, but the theory’s predictions make it so that they’re 
unlikely to ever be particularly useful, so far as we know.
Understanding the nature of the universe better is a good goal in its own 
right — as old as humanity, some might say — but when you’re looking 
at funding multibillion dollar particle accelerators or research satellite 
programs, you might want something tangible for your money and, unfor­
tunately, there’s no reason to think that string theory is going to give you 
anything practical.
Does this mean that exploring string theory isn’t important? No, and it’s my 
hope that reading Part II of this book will help illuminate the key at the heart 
of the search for string theory, or any new scientific truth.
	
No one knows where a scientific theory will lead until the theory is developed 
and tested.
In 1905, when Albert Einstein first presented his famous equation E = mc2, he 
thought it was an intriguing relationship but had no idea that it would result 
in something as potent as the atomic bomb. He had no way of knowing the 

23
 Chapter 1: So What Is String Theory Anyway?
corrections to time calculations demanded by special relativity and general 
relativity would someday be required to get the worldwide global positioning 
system (GPS) to operate correctly (as discussed in Chapter 6).
Quantum physics, which on the surface is about as theoretical of a study as 
they come, is the basis for the laser and transistor, two pieces of technology 
that are at the heart of modern computers and communication systems.
Even though we don’t know what a purely theoretical concept like string 
theory may lead to, history has shown that it will almost certainly lead some­
where profound.
For an example of the unexpected nature of scientific progress, consider the 
discovery and study of electricity, which was originally seen as a mere parlor 
trick. You could predict some technologies from the discovery of electricity, 
to be sure, such as the light bulb. But some of the most profound discoveries 
are things that may never have been predicted — radio and television, the 
computer, the Internet, the cellphone, and so on.
The impact of science extends into culture as well. Another byproduct of 
electricity is rock and roll music, which was created with the advent of elec­
tric guitars and other electric musical instruments.
If electricity can lead to rock and roll and the Internet, then imagine what sort 
of unpredicted (and potentially unpredictable) cultural and technological 
advances string theory could lead to!

P
hysicists like to group concepts together into neat little boxes with 
labels, but sometimes the theories they try to put together just don’t 
want to get along. Right now, nature’s fundamental physical laws can fit into 
one of two boxes: general relativity or quantum physics. But concepts from 
one box just don’t work together well with concepts from the other box.
Any theory that can get these two physics concepts to work together would 
be called a theory of quantum gravity. String theory is currently the most likely 
candidate for a successful theory of quantum gravity.
In this chapter, I explain why scientists want (and need) a theory of quan­
tum gravity. I begin by giving an overview of the scientific understanding of 
gravity, which is defined by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, and our 
understanding of matter and the other forces of nature, in terms of quantum 
mechanics. With these fundamental tools in place, I then explain the ways in 
which these two theories clash with each other that provides the basis for 
quantum gravity. Finally, I outline various attempts to unify these theories 
and the forces of physics together into one coherent system, and the failures 
they’ve run into.

26
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
Understanding Two Schools 
of Thought on Gravity
Physicists are searching for a theory of quantum gravity because the current 
laws governing gravity don’t work in all situations. Specifically, the theory 
of gravity seems to “break down” (that is, the equations become physically 
meaningless) in certain circumstances that I describe later in the chapter. 
To understand what this means, you must first understand a bit about what 
physicists know about gravity.
Gravity is an attractive force that binds objects together, seemingly across 
any amount of distance. The formulation of the classical theory of gravity 
by Sir Isaac Newton was one of the greatest achievements of physics. Two 
centuries later, the reinvention of gravity by Albert Einstein placed him in the 
pantheon of indisputably great scientific thinkers of all time.
Unless you’re a physicist, you probably take gravity for granted. It’s an amaz­
ing force, able to hold the heavens together while being overcome by my 
3-year-old when he’s on a swing — but not for long. At the scale of an atom, 
gravity is irrelevant compared to the electromagnetic force. In fact, a simple 
magnet can overcome the entire force of the planet Earth to pick up metallic 
objects, from paper clips to automobiles.
Newton’s law of gravity: Gravity as force
Sir Isaac Newton developed his theory of gravity in the late 1600s. This amaz­
ing theory involved bringing together an understanding of astronomy and the 
principles of motion (known as mechanics or kinematics) into one compre­
hensive framework that also required the invention of a new form of mathe­
matics: calculus. In Newton’s gravitational theory, objects are drawn together 
by a physical force that spans vast distances of space.
The key is that gravity binds all objects together (much like the Force in Star 
Wars). The apple falling from a tree and the moon’s motion around Earth are 
two manifestations of the exact same fundamental force.
The relationship that Newton discovered was a mathematical relationship 
(he did, after all, have to invent calculus to get it all to work out), just like 
relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory.
In Newton’s gravitational theory, the force between two objects is based on 
the product of their masses, divided by the square of the distance between 
them. In other words, the heavier the two objects are, the more force there is 
between them, assuming the distance between them stays the same. (See the 
nearby sidebar “A matter of mass” for clarification of this relationship.)

27
 Chapter 2: The Physics Road Dead Ends at Quantum Gravity
	
The fact that the force is divided by distance squared means that if the same 
two objects are closer to each other, the power of gravity increases. If the dis­
tance gets wider, the force drops. The inverse square relationship means that 
if the distance doubles, the force drops to one-fourth of its original intensity. If 
the distance is halved, the force increases by four times.
If the objects are very far away, the effect of gravity becomes very small. The 
reason gravity has any impact on the universe is because there’s a lot of it. 
Gravity itself is very weak, as forces go.
	
The opposite is true, as well, and if two objects get extremely close to each 
other — and I’m talking extremely close here — then gravity can become 
incredibly powerful, even among objects that don’t have much mass, like the 
fundamental particles of physics.
This isn’t the only reason gravity is observed so much. Gravity’s strength in the 
universe also comes from the fact that it’s always attracting objects together. 
The electromagnetic force sometimes attracts objects and sometimes repulses 
them, so on the scale of the universe at large, it tends to counteract itself. 
Finally, gravity interacts at very large distances, as opposed to some other 
forces (the nuclear forces) that only work at distances smaller than an atom.
I delve a bit deeper into Newton’s work, both in gravity and in other related 
areas, in Chapter 5.
A matter of mass
When I say that the force between objects is 
proportional to the mass of the two objects, you 
may think this means that heavier things fall 
faster than lighter things. For example, wouldn’t 
a bowling ball fall faster than a soccer ball?
In fact, as Galileo showed (though not with 
modern bowling and soccer balls) years before 
Newton was born, this isn’t the case. For cen­
turies, most people had assumed that heavier 
objects fell faster than light objects. Newton 
was aware of Galileo’s results, which was why 
he was able to figure out how to define force 
the way he did.
By Newton’s explanation, it takes more force to 
move a heavier object. If you dropped a bowl­
ing ball and soccer ball off a building (which I 
don’t recommend), they would accelerate at 
the exact same rate (ignoring air resistance) — 
approximately 9.8 meters per second.
The force acting between the bowling ball and 
Earth would be higher than the force acting on 
the soccer ball, but because it takes more force 
to get the bowling ball moving, the actual rate of 
acceleration between the two is identical.
Realistically, if you performed the experiment 
there would be a slight difference. Because 
of air resistance, the lighter soccer ball would 
probably be slowed down if dropped from a 
high enough point, while the bowling ball would 
not. But a properly constructed experiment, in 
which air resistance is completely neutralized 
(such as in a vacuum), shows that the objects 
fall at the same rate, regardless of mass.

28
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
Despite the success of Newton’s theory, he had a few nagging problems 
in the back of his mind. First and foremost among those was the fact that 
though he had a model for gravity, he didn’t know why gravity worked. The 
gravity that he described was an almost mystical force (like the Force!), 
acting across great distances with no real physical connection required. It 
would take two centuries and Albert Einstein to resolve this problem.
Einstein’s law of gravity: 
Gravity as geometry
Albert Einstein would revolutionize the way physicists saw gravity. Instead 
of gravity as a force acting between objects, Einstein instead envisioned a 
universe in which each object’s mass caused a slight bending of space (actu­
ally space-time) around it. The movement of an object along the shortest 
distance in this space-time was gravity. Instead of being a force, gravity was 
actually an effect of the geometry of space-time itself.
Einstein proposed that motion in the universe could be explained in terms 
of a coordinate system with three space dimensions — up/down, left/right, 
and backward/forward, for example — and one time dimension. This 
4-dimensional coordinate system, developed by Einstein’s old professor 
Hermann Minkowski, was called space-time, and came out of Einstein’s 
1905 theory of special relativity.
As Einstein generalized this theory, creating the theory of general relativity in 
1916, he was able to include gravity in his explanations of motion. In fact, the 
concept of space-time was crucial to it. The space-time coordinate system 
bent when matter was placed in it. As objects moved within space and time, 
they naturally tried to take the shortest path through the bent space-time.
	
We follow our orbit around the sun because it’s the shortest path (called a 
geodesic in mathematics) through the curved space-time around the sun.
Einstein’s relativity is covered in depth in Chapter 6, and the major implica­
tions of relativity to the evolution of the universe are covered in Chapter 9. 
The space-time dimensions are discussed in Chapter 13.
Describing Matter: Physical 
and Energy-Filled
Einstein helped to revolutionize our ideas about the composition of matter as 
much as he did about space, time, and gravity. Thanks to Einstein, scientists 

29
 Chapter 2: The Physics Road Dead Ends at Quantum Gravity
realize that mass — and therefore matter itself — is a form of energy. This 
realization is at the heart of modern physics. Because gravity is an interac­
tion between objects made up of matter, understanding matter is crucial to 
understanding why physicists need a theory of quantum gravity.
Viewing matter classically: 
Chunks of stuff
The study of matter is one of the oldest physics disciplines, because phi­
losophers tried to understand what made up objects. Even fairly recently, a 
physical understanding of matter was elusive, as physicists debated the exis­
tence of atoms — tiny, indivisible chunks of matter that couldn’t be broken 
up anymore.
	
One key physics principle was that matter could be neither created nor 
destroyed, but could only change from one form to another. This principle is 
known as the conservation of mass.
Though it can’t be created or destroyed, matter can be broken, which led to 
the question of whether there was a smallest chunk of matter, the atom, as 
the ancient Greeks had proposed — a question that, throughout the 1800s, 
seemed to point toward an affirmative answer.
As an understanding of thermodynamics — the study of heat and energy, 
which made things like the steam engine (and the Industrial Revolution) 
possible — grew, physicists began to realize that heat could be explained 
as the motion of tiny particles.
The atom had returned, though the findings of 20th-century quantum physics 
would reveal that the atom wasn’t indivisible as everyone thought.
Viewing matter at a quantum 
scale: Chunks of energy
With the rise of modern physics in the 20th century, two key facts about 
matter became clear:
	
✓	As Einstein had proposed with his famous E = mc2 equation, matter and 
energy are, in a sense, interchangeable.
	
✓	Matter was incredibly complex, made up of an array of bizarre and 
unexpected types of particles that joined together to form other types 
of particles.

30
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
	
The atom, it turned out, was composed of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. 
The nucleus was made up of protons and neutrons, which were, in turn, made 
up of strange new particles called quarks! As soon as physicists thought they 
had reached a fundamental unit of matter, they seemed to discover that it 
could be broken open and still smaller units could be pulled out.
Not only that, but even these fundamental particles didn’t seem to be 
enough. It turned out that there were three families of particles, some of 
which only appeared at significantly higher energies than scientists had pre­
viously explored.
Today, the Standard Model of particle physics contains 18 distinct fundamen­
tal particles, 17 of which have been observed experimentally. (Physicists are 
still waiting on the Higgs boson.)
Grasping for the Fundamental 
Forces of Physics
Even while the numbers of particles became more bizarre and complex, the 
ways those objects interacted turned out to be surprisingly straightforward. 
In the 20th century, scientists discovered that objects in the universe experi­
enced only four fundamental types of interactions:
	
✓	Electromagnetism
	
✓	Strong nuclear force
	
✓	Weak nuclear force
	
✓	Gravity
Physicists have discovered profound connections between these forces — 
except for gravity, which seems to stand apart from the others for reasons 
that physicists still aren’t completely certain about. Trying to incorporate 
gravity with all the other forces — to discover how the fundamental forces 
are related to each other — is a key insight that many physicists hope a 
theory of quantum gravity will offer.
Electromagnetism: Super-speedy 
energy waves
Discovered in the 19th century, the electromagnetic force (or electromag­
netism) is a unification of the electrostatic force and the magnetic force. In 
the mid-20th century, this force was explained in a framework of quantum 

31
 Chapter 2: The Physics Road Dead Ends at Quantum Gravity
mechanics called quantum electrodynamics, or QED. In this framework, the 
electromagnetic force is transferred by particles of light, called photons.
The relationship between electricity and magnetism is covered in Chapter 5, 
but the basic relationship comes down to electrical charge and its motion. 
The electrostatic force causes charges to exert forces on each other in a 
relationship that’s similar to (but more powerful than) gravity — an inverse 
square law. This time, though, the intensity is based not on the mass of the 
objects, but the charge.
The electron is a particle that contains a negative electrical charge, while the 
proton in the atomic nucleus has a positive electrical charge. Traditionally, 
electricity is seen as the flow of electrons (negative charge) through a wire. 
This flow of electrons is called an electric current.
A wire with an electrical current flowing through it creates a magnetic field. 
Alternately, when a magnet is moved near a wire, it causes a current to flow. 
(This is the basis of most electric power generators.)
This is the way in which electricity and magnetism are related. In the 1800s, 
physicist James Clerk Maxwell unified the two concepts into one theory, 
called electromagnetism, which depicted this force as waves of energy moving 
through space.
One key component of Maxwell’s unification was a discovery that the elec­
tromagnetic force moved at the speed of light. In other words, the electro­
magnetic waves that Maxwell predicted from his theory were a form of light 
waves.
Quantum electrodynamics retains this relationship between electromagne­
tism and light, because in QED the information about the force is transferred 
between two charged particles (or magnetic particles) by another particle — 
a photon, or particle of light. (Physicists say that the electromagnetic force is 
mediated by a photon.)
Nuclear forces: What the strong force 
joins, the weak force tears apart
In addition to gravity and electromagnetism, 20th-century physics discovered 
two nuclear forces called the strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force. 
These forces are also mediated by particles. The strong force is mediated 
by a type of particle called a gluon. The weak force is mediated by three 
particles: Z, W+, and W– bosons. (You can read more about these particles in 
Chapter 8.)

32
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
The strong nuclear force holds quarks together to form protons and neu­
trons, but it also holds the protons and neutrons together inside the atom’s 
nucleus.
The weak nuclear force, on the other hand, is responsible for radioactive 
decay, such as when the neutron decays into a proton. The processes gov­
erned by the weak nuclear force are responsible for the burning of stars and 
the formation of heavy elements inside of stars.
Infinities: Why Einstein and 
the Quanta Don’t Get Along
Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which explains gravity, does an excel­
lent job at explaining the universe on the scale of the cosmos. Quantum phys­
ics does an excellent job of explaining the universe on the scale of an atom or 
smaller. In between those scales, good old-fashioned classical physics usually 
rules.
Unfortunately, some problems bring general relativity and quantum physics 
into conflict, resulting in mathematical infinities in the equations. (Infinity 
is essentially an abstract number that is larger than any other numbers. 
Though certain cartoon characters like to go “To infinity and beyond,” scien­
tists don’t like to see infinities come up in mathematical equations.) Infinities 
come up in quantum physics, but physicists have developed mathemati­
cal techniques to tame them in many of those cases, so the results match 
experiments. In some cases, however, these techniques don’t apply. Because 
physicists never witness real infinities in nature, these troublesome problems 
motivate a search for quantum gravity.
Each of the theories works fine on its own, but when you get into areas where 
both have something specific to say about the same thing — such as what’s 
going on at the border of a black hole — things get very complicated. The 
quantum fluctuations make the distinction between the inside and outside of 
the black hole kind of fuzzy, and general relativity needs that distinction to 
work properly. Neither theory by itself can fully explain what’s going on in 
these specific cases.
	
This is the heart of why physicists need a theory of quantum gravity. With 
the current theories, you get situations that don’t look like they make sense. 
Physicists don’t see infinities, yet as you’ll see, both relativity and quantum 
physics indicate that they should exist. Reconciling this bizarre region in the 
middle, where neither theory can fully describe what’s going on, is the goal of 
quantum gravity.

 Chapter 2: The Physics Road Dead Ends at Quantum Gravity
Singularities: Bending gravity 
to the breaking point
Because matter causes a bending of space-time, cramming a lot of matter into 
a very small space causes a lot of bending of space-time. In fact, some solu­
tions to Einstein’s general relativity equations show situations where space-
time bends an infinite amount — called a singularity. Specifically, a space-time 
singularity shows up in the mathematical equations of general relativity in 
two situations:
	
✓	During the early big bang period of the universe’s history
	
✓	Inside black holes
These subjects are covered in more detail in Chapter 9, but both situations 
involve a density of matter (a lot of matter in a small space) that’s enough 
to cause problems with the smooth space-time geometry that relativity 
depends on.
	
These singularities represent points where the theory of general relativ­
ity breaks down completely. Even talking about what goes on at this point 
becomes meaningless, so physicists need to refine the theory of gravity to 
include rules about how to talk about these situations in a meaningful way.
Some believe that this problem can be solved by altering Einstein’s theory 
of gravity (as you see in Chapter 19). String theorists don’t usually want to 
modify gravity (at least at the energy levels scientists normally look at); they 
just want to create a framework that allows gravity to work without running 
into these mathematical (and physical) infinities.
Quantum jitters: Space-time under 
a quantum microscope
A second type of infinity, proposed by John Wheeler in 1955, is the quantum 
foam or, as it’s called by string theorist and best-selling author Brian Greene, 
the quantum jitters. Quantum effects mean that space-time at very tiny dis­
tance scales (called the Planck length) is a chaotic sea of virtual particles 
being created and destroyed. At these levels, space-time is certainly not 
smooth as relativity suggests, but is a tangled web of extreme and random 
energy fluctuations, as shown in Figure 2-1.

34
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
	
Figure 2-1: 
If you 
zoom in on 
space-time 
enough, 
a chaotic 
“quantum 
foam” 
may exist.
	
The basis for the quantum jitters is the uncertainty principle, one of the key 
(and most unusual) features of quantum physics. This is explained in more 
detail in Chapter 7, but the key component of the uncertainty principle is that 
certain pairs of quantities — for example, position and velocity, or time and 
energy — are linked together, so that the more precisely one is measured, 
the more uncertain the other quantity is. This isn’t just a statement about 
measurement, though, but a fundamental uncertainty in nature!
	
In other words, nature is a bit “blurry” according to quantum physics. This 
blurriness only shows up at very small distances, but this problem creates the 
quantum foam.
One example of the blurriness comes in the form of virtual particles. 
According to quantum field theory (a field theory is one where each point in 
space has a certain value, similar to a gravitational field or electromagnetic 
field), even the empty void of space has a slight energy associated with it. 
This energy can be used to, very briefly, bring a pair of particles — a particle 
and its antiparticle, to be precise — into existence. The particles exist for 
only a moment, and then destroy each other. It’s as if they borrowed enough 
energy from the universe to exist for just a few fractions of a second.
The problem is that when you look at space-time at very small scales, the 
effects of these virtual particles become very important. The energy fluctua­
tions predicted by the uncertainty principle take on massive proportions. 
Without a quantum theory of gravity, there’s no way to really figure out 
what’s going on at sizes that small.

 Chapter 2: The Physics Road Dead Ends at Quantum Gravity
Unifying the Forces
The attempt to unite gravity with the other three forces, as well as with quan­
tum physics, was one of the driving forces of physics throughout the 20th 
century (and it still is). In a way, these sorts of unifications of different ideas 
are the major discoveries in science throughout the ages.
Quantum electrodynamics successfully created a quantum theory of electro­
magnetism. Later, the electroweak theory unified this theory together with 
the weak nuclear force. The strong nuclear force is explained by quantum 
chromodynamics. The current model of physics that explains all three of 
these forces is called the Standard Model of particle physics, which is cov­
ered in much more detail in Chapter 8. Unifying gravity with the other forces 
would create a new version of the Standard Model and would explain how 
gravity works on the quantum level. Many physicists hope that string theory 
will ultimately prove to be this theory.
Einstein’s failed quest to 
explain everything
After Einstein successfully worked the major kinks out of his theory of gen­
eral relativity, he turned his attention toward trying to unify this theory of 
gravity with electromagnetism, as well as with quantum physics. In fact, 
Einstein would spend most of the rest of his life trying to develop this unified 
theory, but would die unsuccessful.
Throughout the quest, Einstein looked at almost any theory he could think 
of. One of these ideas was to add an extra space dimension and roll it up into 
a very small size. This approach, called a Kaluza-Klein theory after the men 
who created it, is addressed in Chapter 6. This same approach would eventu­
ally be used by string theorists to deal with the pesky extra dimensions that 
arose in their own theories.
Ultimately, none of Einstein’s attempts bore fruit. To the day of his death, 
he worked feverishly on completing his unified field theory in a manner that 
many physicists have considered a sad end to such a great career.
Today, however, some of the most intense theoretical physics work is in the 
search for a theory to unify gravity and the rest of physics, mainly in the form 
of string theory.

36
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
A particle of gravity: The graviton
The Standard Model of particle physics explains electromagnetism, the 
strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force as fields that follow the 
rules of gauge theory. Gauge theory is based heavily on mathematical sym­
metries. Because these forces are quantum theories, the gauge fields come 
in discrete units (that’s where the word quantum comes from) — and these 
units actually turn out to be particles in their own right, called gauge bosons. 
The forces described by a gauge theory are carried, or mediated, by these 
gauge bosons. For example, the electromagnetic force is mediated by the 
proton. When gravity is written in the form of a gauge theory, the gauge 
boson for gravity is called the graviton. (If you’re confused about gauge theo­
ries, don’t worry too much — just remember that the graviton is what makes 
gravity work and you’ll know everything that you need to know to under­
stand their application to string theory.)
Physicists have identified some features of the theoretical graviton so that, 
if it exists, it can be recognized. For one thing, the particle is massless, which 
means it has no rest mass — the particle is always in motion, and that proba­
bly means it travels at the speed of light (although in Chapter 19 you find out 
about a theory of modified gravity in which gravity and light move through 
space at different speeds).
Another feature of the graviton is that it has a spin of 2. (Spin is a quantum 
number indicating an inherent property of a particle that acts kind of like 
angular momentum. Fundamental particles have an inherent spin, meaning 
that they interact with other particles like they’re spinning even when they 
aren’t.)
A graviton also has no electrical charge. It’s a stable particle, which means it 
would not decay.
	
So physicists are looking for a massless particle moving at an incredibly fast 
speed, with no electrical charge, and a quantum spin of 2. Even though the 
graviton has never been discovered by experiment, it’s the gauge boson that 
mediates the gravitational force. Given the incredibly weak strength of gravity in 
relation to other forces, trying to identify gravitons is an incredibly hard task.

37
 Chapter 2: The Physics Road Dead Ends at Quantum Gravity
The possible existence of the graviton in string theory is one of the major 
motivations for looking toward the theory as a likely solution to the problem 
of quantum gravity.
Supersymmetry’s role in quantum gravity
Supersymmetry is a principle that says that two types of fundamental par­
ticles, bosons and fermions, are connected to each other. The benefit of this 
type of symmetry is that the mathematical relationships in gauge theory 
reduce in such a way that unifying all the forces becomes more feasible. (I 
explain bosons and fermions in greater detail in Chapter 8, while I present a 
more detailed discussion of supersymmetry in Chapter 10.)
The top graph in Figure 2-2 shows the three forces described by the Standard 
Model modeled at different energy levels. If the three forces met up in the 
same point, it would indicate that there might be an energy level where these 
three forces became fully unified into one superforce.
However, as seen in the lower graph of Figure 2-2, when supersymmetry is 
introduced into the equation (literally, not just metaphorically), the three 
forces meet in a single point. If supersymmetry proves to be true, it’s strong 
evidence that the three forces of the Standard Model unify at high enough 
energy.
Many physicists believe that all four forces were once unified at high energy 
levels, but as the universe reduced into a lower-energy state, the inherent 
symmetry between the forces began to break down. This broken symmetry 
caused the creation of four distinct forces of nature.
The goal of a theory of quantum gravity is, in a sense, an attempt to look 
back in time, to when these four forces were unified as one. If successful, it 
would profoundly affect our understanding of the first few moments of the 
universe — the last time that the forces joined together in this way.

of String Theory

▶	Wondering what the future of string theory holds
S
tring theory is a work in progress, having captured the hearts and minds 
of much of the theoretical physics community while being apparently 
disconnected from any realistic chance of definitive experimental proof. 
Despite this, it has had some successes — unexpected predictions and 
achievements that may well indicate string theorists are on the right track.
String theory critics would also point out (and many string theorists would 
probably agree) that the last decade hasn’t been kind to string theory 
because the momentum toward a unified theory of everything has slowed 
because of a fracture among many different versions of string theory, instead 
of a single version of the theory.
In this chapter, you see some of the major successes and failures of string 
theory, as well as look at the possibilities for where string theory may go 
from here. The controversy over string theory rests entirely on how much 
significance physicists give to these different outcomes.
Celebrating String Theory’s Successes
String theory has gone through many transformations since its origins in 
1968 when it was hoped to be a model of certain types of particle collisions. 
It initially failed at that goal, but in the 40 years since, string theory has 
developed into the primary candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. It has 
driven major developments in mathematics, and theorists have used insights 

40
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
from string theory to tackle other, unexpected problems in physics. In fact, 
the very presence of gravity within string theory is an unexpected outcome!
Predicting gravity out of strings
The first and foremost success of string theory is the unexpected discovery 
of objects within the theory that match the properties of the graviton. These 
objects are a specific type of closed strings that are also massless particles 
that have spin of 2, exactly like gravitons. To put it another way, gravitons 
are a spin-2 massless particle that, under string theory, can be formed by a 
certain type of vibrating closed string. String theory wasn’t created to have 
gravitons — they’re a natural and required consequence of the theory.
One of the greatest problems in modern theoretical physics is that grav­
ity seems to be disconnected from all the other forces of physics that are 
explained by the Standard Model of particle physics. String theory solves this 
problem because it not only includes gravity, but it makes gravity a neces­
sary byproduct of the theory.
Explaining what happens 
to a black hole (sort of)
A major motivating factor for the search for a theory of quantum gravity is 
to explain the behavior of black holes, and string theory appears to be one 
of the best methods of achieving that goal. String theorists have created 
mathematical models of black holes that appear similar to predictions made 
by Stephen Hawking more than 30 years ago and may be at the heart of 
resolving a long-standing puzzle within theoretical physics: What happens to 
matter that falls into a black hole?
Scientists’ understanding of black holes has always run into problems, 
because to study the quantum behavior of a black hole you need to some­
how describe all the quantum states (possible configurations, as defined by 
quantum physics) of the black hole. Unfortunately, black holes are objects in 
general relativity, so it’s not clear how to define these quantum states. (See 
Chapter 2 for an explanation of the conflicts between general relativity and 
quantum physics.)
	
String theorists have created models that appear to be identical to black holes 
in certain simplified conditions, and they use that information to calculate the 
quantum states of the black holes. Their results have been shown to match 
Hawking’s predictions, which he made without any precise way to count the 
quantum states of the black hole.

41
 Chapter 3: Accomplishments and Failures of String Theory
This is the closest that string theory has come to an experimental prediction. 
Unfortunately, there’s nothing experimental about it because scientists can’t 
directly observe black holes (yet). It’s a theoretical prediction that unexpect­
edly matches another (well-accepted) theoretical prediction about black 
holes. And, beyond that, the prediction only holds for certain types of black 
holes and has not yet been successfully extended to all black holes.
For a more extended look at black holes and string theory, check out 
Chapters 9, 11, and 14.
Explaining quantum field theory 
using string theory
One of the major successes of string theory is something called the 
Maldacena conjecture, or the AdS/CFT correspondence. (I get into what this 
stands for and means in Chapter 11.) Developed in 1997 and soon expanded 
on, this correspondence appears to give insights into gauge theories, such as 
those at the heart of quantum field theory. (See Chapter 2 for an explanation 
of gauge theories.)
The original AdS/CFT correspondence, written by Juan Maldacena, proposes 
that a certain 3-dimensional (three space dimensions, like our universe) 
gauge theory, with the most supersymmetry allowed, describes the same 
physics as a string theory in a 4-dimensional (four space dimensions) world. 
This means that questions about string theory can be asked in the language 
of gauge theory, which is a quantum theory that physicists know how to 
work with!
Like John Travolta, string theory 
keeps making a comeback
String theory has suffered more setbacks than probably any other scientific 
theory in the history of the world, but those hiccups don’t seem to last that 
long. Every time it seems that some flaw comes along in the theory, the math­
ematical resiliency of string theory seems to not only save it, but to bring it 
back stronger than ever.
When extra dimensions came into the theory in the 1970s, the theory was 
abandoned by many, but it had a comeback in the first superstring revolu­
tion. It then turned out there were five distinct versions of string theory, 
but a second superstring revolution was sparked by unifying them. When 
string theorists realized a vast number of solutions of string theories (each 
solution to string theory is called a vacuum, while many solutions are called 

42
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
vacua) were possible, they turned this into a virtue instead of a drawback. 
Unfortunately, even today, some scientists believe that string theory is failing 
at its goals. (See “Considering String Theory’s Setbacks” later in this chapter.)
Being the most popular theory in town
Many young physicists feel that string theory, as the primary theory of quan­
tum gravity, is the best (or only) avenue for making a significant contribution 
to our understanding of this topic. Over the last two decades, high-energy 
theoretical physics (especially in the United States) has become dominated 
by string theorists. In the high-stakes world of “publish or perish” academia, 
this is a major success.
Why do so many physicists turn toward this field when it offers no experi­
mental evidence? Some of the brightest theoretical physicists of either the 
20th or the 21st centuries — Edward Witten, John Henry Schwarz, Leonard 
Susskind, and others you meet throughout this book — continually return to 
the same common reasons in support of their interest:
	
✓	If string theory were wrong, it wouldn’t provide the rich structure that it 
does, such as with the development of the heterotic string (see Chapter 
10) that allows for an approximation of the Standard Model of physics 
within string theory.
	
✓	If string theory were wrong, it wouldn’t lead to better understandings 
of quantum field theory, quantum chromodynamics (see Chapter 8), 
or the quantum states of black holes, as have been presented by the 
work of Leonard Susskind, Andrew Strominger, Cumrun Vafa, and Juan 
Maldacena (see Chapters 11 and 14).
	
✓	If string theory were wrong, it would have collapsed in upon itself well 
before now, instead of passing many mathematical consistency checks 
(such as those discussed in Chapter 10) and providing more and more 
elaborate ways to be interpreted, such as the dualities and symmetries 
that allowed for the presentation of M-theory (as discussed in Chapter 11).
This is how theoretical physicists think, and it’s why so many of them 
continue to believe that string theory is the place to be. The mathemati­
cal beauty of the theory, the fact that it’s so adaptable, is seen as one of its 
virtues. The theory continues to be refined, and it hasn’t been shown to be 
incompatible with our universe. There has been no brick wall where the 
theory failed to provide something new and (in some eyes, at least) meaning­
ful, so those studying string theory have had no reason to give up and look 
somewhere else. (The history of string theory in Chapters 10 and 11 offers a 
better appreciation of these achievements.)

43
 Chapter 3: Accomplishments and Failures of String Theory
Whether this resilience of string theory will translate someday into proof that 
the theory is fundamentally correct remains to be seen, but for the majority 
of those working on the problems, confidence is high.
As you can read in Chapter 17, this popularity is also seen by some critics 
as a flaw. Physics thrives on the rigorous debate of conflicting ideas, and 
some physicists are concerned that the driving support of string theory, to 
the exclusion of all other ideas, isn’t healthy for the field. For some of these 
critics, the mathematics of string theory has, indeed, already shown that the 
theory isn’t performing as expected (or, in their view, as needed to be a fun­
damental theory) and the string theorists are in denial.
Considering String Theory’s Setbacks
Because string theory has made so few specific predictions, it’s hard to dis­
prove it, but the theory has fallen short of some of the hype about how it will 
be a fundamental theory to explain all the physics in our universe, a “theory 
of everything.” This failure to meet that lofty goal seems to be the basis of 
many (if not most) of the attacks against it.
In Chapter 17, you find more detailed criticisms of string theory. Some of 
these cut to the very heart of whether string theory is even scientific or 
whether it’s being pursued in the correct way. For now, I leave these more 
abstract questions and focus on three issues that even most string theorists 
aren’t particularly happy about:
	
✓	Because of supersymmetry, string theory requires a large number of 
particles beyond what scientists have ever observed.
	
✓	This new theory of gravity was unable to predict the accelerated expan­
sion of the universe that was detected by astronomers.
	
✓	A vastly large number of mathematically feasible string theory vacua 
(solutions) currently exist, so it seems virtually impossible to figure out 
which could describe our universe.
The following sections cover these dilemmas in more detail.
The universe doesn’t have enough particles
For the mathematics of string theory to work, physicists have to assume a 
symmetry in nature called supersymmetry, which creates a correspondence 
between different types of particles. One problem with this is that instead of 
the 18 fundamental particles in the Standard Model, supersymmetry requires 
at least 36 fundamental particles (which means that nature allows 18 par­
ticles that scientists have never seen!).

44
Part I: Introducing String Theory 
In some ways, string theory does make things simpler — the fundamental 
objects are strings and branes or, as predicted by matrix theory, zero-
dimensional branes called partons. These strings, branes, or possibly partons 
make up the particles that physicists have observed (or the ones they hope to 
observe). But that’s on a very fundamental level; from a practical standpoint, 
string theory doubles the number of particles allowed by nature from 18 to 36.
One of the biggest possible successes for string theory would be to experi­
mentally detect these missing supersymmetric partner particles. The hope of 
many theoretical physicists is that when the Large Hadron Collider particle 
accelerator at CERN in Switzerland goes fully online, it will detect super­
symmetric particles.
Even if successful, proof of supersymmetry doesn’t inherently prove string 
theory, so the debate would continue to rage on, but at least one major 
objection would be removed. Supersymmetry might well end up being true, 
whether or not string theory as a whole is shown to accurately describe 
nature.
Dark energy: The discovery string 
theory should have predicted
Astronomers found evidence in 1998 that the expansion of the universe 
was actually accelerating. This accelerated expansion is caused by the dark 
energy that appears so often in the news. Not only did string theory not pre­
dict the existence of dark energy, but attempts to use science’s best theories 
to calculate the amount of dark energy comes up with a number that’s vastly 
larger than the one observed by astronomers. The theory just absolutely 
failed to initially make sense of dark energy.
Claiming this as a flaw of string theory is a bit more controversial than the 
other two, but there’s some (albeit questionable) logic behind it. The goal of 
string theory is nothing less than the complete rewriting of gravitational law, 
so it’s not unreasonable to think that string theory should have anticipated 
dark energy in some way. When Einstein constructed his theory of general rela­
tivity, the mathematics indicated that space could be expanding (later proved 
to be true). When Paul Dirac formulated a quantum theory of the electron, the 
mathematics indicated an antiparticle existed (later proved to actually exist). 
A profound theory like string theory can be expected to illuminate new facts 
about our universe, not be blind-sided by unanticipated discoveries.
Of course, no other theory anticipated an accelerating expansion of the uni­
verse either. Prior to the observational evidence (some of which is still con­
tested, as you find out in Chapter 19), cosmologists (and string theorists) had 
no reason to assume that the expansion rate of space was increasing. Years 

45
 Chapter 3: Accomplishments and Failures of String Theory
after dark energy was discovered, it was shown that string theory could be 
modified to include it, which string theorists count as a success (although 
the critics continue to be unsatisfied).
Where did all of these “fundamental” 
theories come from?
Unfortunately, as string theorists performed more research, they had a 
growing problem (pun intended). Instead of narrowing in on a single vacuum 
(solution) that could be used to explain the universe, it began to look like 
there were an absurdly large number of vacua. Some physicists’ hopes that a 
unique, fundamental version of string theory would fall out of the mathemat­
ics effectively dissolved.
In truth, such hype was rarely justified in the first place. In general relativity, 
for example, an infinite number of ways to solve the equations exist, and the 
goal is to find solutions that match our universe. The overly ambitious string 
theorists (the ones who expected a single vacuum to fall out of the sky) soon 
realized that they, too, would end up with a rich string theory landscape, 
as Leonard Susskind calls the range of possible vacua (see Chapter 11 for 
more on the Susskind’s landscape idea). The goal of string theory has since 
become to figure out which set of vacua applies to our universe.
Looking into String Theory’s Future
At present, string theory faces two hurdles. The first is the theoretical 
hurdle, which is whether a model can be formulated that describes our own 
universe. The second hurdle is the experimental one, because even if string 
theorists are successful in modeling our universe, they’ll then have to figure 
out how to make a distinct prediction from the theory that’s testable in 
some way.
Right now, string theory falls short on both counts, and it’s unclear whether 
it can ever be formulated in a way that will be uniquely testable. The critics 
claim that growing disillusionment with string theory is rising among theoret­
ical physicists, while the supporters continue to talk about how string theory 
is being used to resolve the major questions of the universe.
Only time will tell whether string theory is right or wrong, but regardless of 
the answer, string theory has driven scientists for years to ask fundamental 
questions about our universe and explore the answers to those questions in 
new ways. Even an alternative theory would in part owe its success to the 
hard work performed by string theorists.

Part I: Introducing String Theory 
Theoretical complications: Can 
we figure out string theory?
The current version of string theory is called M-theory, introduced in 1995, 
which is a comprehensive theory that includes the five supersymmetric 
string theories. M-Theory exists in 11 dimensions. There’s just one problem. 
No one knows what M-theory is.
	
Scientists are searching for a complete string theory, but they don’t have one 
yet. And, until they do, there’s no way of knowing that they’ll be successful. 
Until string theorists have a complete theory that describes our own universe, 
the theory could all be smoke and mirrors. Although some aspects of string 
theory may be shown to be true, it may be that these are only approximations 
of some more fundamental theory — or it may be that string theory is actually 
that fundamental theory itself.
String theory, the driving force of 21st-century theoretical physics, could 
prove to be nothing more than a mathematical illusion that provides some 
approximate insights into science but isn’t actually the theory that drives the 
forces of nature.
It’s unclear how long the search for a theory can last without some specific 
breakthrough. There’s a sense (among some) that the most brilliant physi­
cists on the planet have been spinning their wheels for decades, with only a 
handful of significant insights, and even those discoveries don’t seem to lead 
anywhere specific.
The theoretical implications of string theory are addressed in Chapters 10 
and 11, while the criticism of the theory rears its ugly head in Chapter 17.
Experimental complications: 
Can we prove string theory?
Even if a precise version of string theory (or M-theory) is formulated, the 
question then moves from the theoretical to the experimental realm. Right 
now, the energy levels that scientists can reach in experiments are prob­
ably way too small to realistically test string theory, although aspects of the 
theory can be tested today.
Theory moves forward with directions from experiment, but the last input 
that string theory had from experiment was the realization that it failed as 
a theory describing the scattering of particles within particle accelerators. 

47
 Chapter 3: Accomplishments and Failures of String Theory
The realm string theory claims to explain involves distances so tiny that it’s 
questionable whether scientists will ever achieve a technology able to probe 
at that length, so it’s possible that string theory is an inherently untestable 
theory of nature. (Some versions of string theory do make predictions in test­
able ranges, however, and string theorists hope that these versions of string 
theory may apply to our universe.)
You find out some ways to possibly test string theory in Chapter 12, although 
these are only speculative because right now science doesn’t even have a 
theory that makes any unique predictions. The best physicists can hope for 
are some hints, such as the discovery of extra dimensions of certain types, 
new cosmological predictions about the formation of our universe, or the 
missing supersymmetric particles, that would give some direction to the 
theoretical search.

tring theory is an evolution of concepts that have 
been around for at least 300 years. To understand the 
theory and its implications, you have to first understand 
certain fundamental concepts, such as how scientific 
theories develop.
In this part, you see how science progresses, which 
will be helpful as you encounter the various scientific 
revolutions that have led to string theory. I introduce 
physics concepts at the heart of string theory, ranging 
from the smallest distance measurable to the entire 
universe. These overviews allow you to follow the later 
string theory topics. However, the chapters in this part 
don’t even come close to providing complete explanations 
of the fundamental topics from classical physics, relativity, 
quantum physics, particle physics, and cosmology.
For more detailed introductions to the physics concepts 
addressed in Part II, I recommend Physics For Dummies, 
Einstein For Dummies, Quantum Physics For Dummies, and 
Astronomy For Dummies, 2nd edition, (all published by 
Wiley) as excellent starting points.

tring theory is at the cutting edge of science. It’s a mathematical theory 
of nature that, at present, makes few predictions that are testable. This 
begs the question of what it takes for a theory to be scientific.
In this chapter, I look a bit more closely at the methods scientists use to 
investigate nature’s structure. I explore how scientists perform science and 
some of the ways that their work is viewed. I certainly don’t solve any of 
these big, philosophical issues in this chapter, but my goal is to make it clear 
that scientists have differing views about how the nature of science is sup­
posed to work. Although I could write pages and pages on the evolution of 
scientific thought throughout the ages, I touch on these topics in just enough 
detail to help you understand some of the arguments in favor of and against 
string theory.

Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Exploring the Practice of Science
Before you can figure out whether string theory is scientific, you have to ask, 
“What is science?”
Science is the methodical practice of trying to understand and predict the 
consequences of natural phenomena. This is done through two distinct but 
closely related means: theory and experiment.
Not all science is created equal. Some science is performed with diagrams 
and mathematical equations. Other science is performed with costly experi­
mental apparatus. Still other forms of science, while also costly, involve 
observing distant galaxies for clues to the mystery of the universe.
String theory has spent more than 30 years focusing on the theory side of the 
scientific equation and, sadly, is lacking on the experimental side, as critics 
never hesitate to point out. Ideally, the theories developed would eventually 
be validated by experimental evidence. (See the later sections “The need for 
experimental falsifiability” and “The foundation of theory is mathematics” for 
more on the necessity of experimentation.)
The myth of the scientific method
When in school, I was taught that science followed nice, simple rules called 
the scientific method. These rules are a classical model of scientific investiga­
tion based on principles of reductionism and inductive logic. In other words, 
you take observations, break them down (the reductionism part), and use 
them to create generalized laws (the inductive logic part). String theory’s his­
tory certainly doesn’t follow this nice classical model.
In school, the steps of the scientific method actually changed a bit depend­
ing on the textbook I had in a given year, though they generally had mostly 
common elements. Frequently, they were delineated as a set of bullet points:
	
✓	Observe a phenomenon: Look at nature
	
✓	Formulate a hypothesis: Ask a question (or propose an answer)
	
✓	Test the hypothesis: Perform an experiment
	
✓	Analyze the data: Confirm or reject the hypothesis

53
 Chapter 4: Putting String Theory in Context
In a way, this scientific method is a myth. I earned a degree in physics, with 
honors no less, without once being asked a question about the scientific 
method in a physics course. (It did come up in my Philosophy of Science 
course, which you can thank for much of this chapter.)
Turns out there’s no single scientific method that all scientists follow. 
Scientists don’t look at a list and think, “Well, I’ve observed my phenomenon 
for the day. Time to formulate my hypothesis.” Instead, science is a dynamic 
activity that involves a continuous, active analysis of the world. It’s an inter­
play between the world we observe and the world we conceptualize. Science 
is a translation between observations, experimental evidence, and the 
hypotheses and theoretical frameworks that are built to explain and expand 
on those observations.
Still, the basic ideas of the scientific method do tend to hold. They aren’t so 
much hard and fast rules, but they’re guiding principles that can be com­
bined in different ways depending on what’s being studied.
The need for experimental falsifiability
Traditionally, the idea has been that an experiment can either confirm or refute 
a theory. An experimental result yields positive evidence if it supports the 
theory, while a result that contradicts the hypothesis is negative evidence.
In the 20th century, a notion arose that the key to a theory — the thing that 
makes it scientific — is whether it can in some way be shown to be false. This 
principle of falsifiability can be controversial when applied to string theory, 
which theoretically explores energy levels that can’t at present (or possibly 
Breaking down nature with Bacon
The ideas of the scientific method are often 
traced back to Sir Francis Bacon’s 1620 book 
Novum Organum. It proposed that reduction­
ism and inductive reasoning could be used to 
arrive at fundamental truths about the causes 
of natural events.
In the Baconian model, the scientist breaks 
natural phenomena down into component parts 
that are then compared to other components 
based on common themes. These reduced cat­
egories are then analyzed using principles of 
inductive reasoning.
Inductive reasoning is a logical system of anal­
ysis where you start with specific true state­
ments and work to create generalized laws, 
which would apply to all situations, by finding 
commonalities between the observed truths.

54
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
ever) be directly explored experimentally. Some claim that because string 
theory currently fails the test of falsifiability, it’s somehow not “real science.” 
(Check out Chapter 17 for more on this idea.)
The focus on this falsifiability is traced back to philosopher Karl Popper’s 
1934 book The Logic of Scientific Discovery. He was opposed to the reduction­
ist and inductive methods that Francis Bacon had popularized three centu­
ries earlier. In a time that was characterized by the rise of modern physics, it 
appeared that the old rules no longer applied.
Popper reasoned that the principles of physics arose not merely by viewing 
little chunks of information, but by creating theories that were tested and 
repeatedly failed to be proved false. Observation alone could not have led to 
these insights, he claimed, if they’d never been put in positions to be proven 
false. In the most extreme form, this emphasis on falsifiability states that sci­
entific theories don’t tell you anything definite about the world, but are only 
the best guesses about the future based on past experience.
For example, if I predict that the sun will rise every morning, I can test this by 
looking out my window every morning for 50 days. If the sun is there every 
day, I have not proved that the sun will be there on the 51st day. After I actu­
ally observe it on the 51st day, I’ll know that my prediction worked out again, 
but I haven’t proved anything about the 52nd day, the 53rd, and so on.
	
No matter how good a scientific prediction is, if you can run a test that shows 
that it’s false, you have to throw out the idea (or, at least, modify your theory 
to explain the new data). This led the 19th century biologist Thomas Henry 
Huxley to define the great tragedy of science as “the slaying of a beautiful 
hypothesis by an ugly fact.”
To Popper, this was far from tragic, but was instead the brilliance of science. 
The defining component of a scientific theory, the thing that separates it 
from mere speculation, is that it makes a falsifiable claim.
Popper’s claim is sometimes controversial, especially when being used by 
one scientist (or philosopher) to discredit an entire field of science. Many 
still believe that reduction and inductive reasoning can, in fact, lead to the 
creation of meaningful theoretical frameworks that represent reality as it is, 
even if there’s no claim that is falsifiable.
String theory founder Leonard Susskind makes just this argument. He 
believes not in falsification, but rather in confirmation — you can have direct 
positive evidence for a theory, rather than just a lack of negative evidence 
against it.

55
 Chapter 4: Putting String Theory in Context
This viewpoint comes out of an online debate between Susskind and physi­
cist Lee Smolin (you can view the debate at www.edge.org/3rd_culture/
smolin_susskind04/smolin_susskind.html). In the debate, Susskind 
lists several examples of theories that have been denounced as unfalsifiable: 
behaviorism in psychology along with quark models and inflationary theory 
in physics.
The examples he provides are cases where scientists believe that certain 
traits couldn’t be examined and methods were later developed that allowed 
them to be tested. There’s a difference between being unable to falsify a 
theory in practice and being unable to falsify it in principle.
It may seem as if this debate over confirmation and falsifiability is academic. 
That’s probably true, but some physicists see string theory as a battle over 
the very meaning of physics. Many string theory critics believe that it’s inher­
ently unfalsifiable, while string theorists believe a mechanism to test (and 
falsify) the prediction of string theory will be found.
The foundation of theory is mathematics
In physics, complex mathematical models are built that represent the under­
lying physical laws that nature follows. These mathematical models are the 
real theories of physics that physicists can then relate to meaningful events 
in the real world through experiment and other means.
Science requires both experiment and theory to build explanations of what 
happens in the world. To paraphrase Einstein, science without theory is 
lame, while science without experiment is blind.
	
If physics is built on a foundation of experimental observation, then theoreti­
cal physics is the blueprint that explains how those observations fit together. 
The insights of theory have to move beyond the details of specific observa­
tions and connect them in new ways. Ideally, these connections lead to other 
predictions that are testable by experiment. String theory has not yet made 
this significant leap from theory to experiment.
	
A large part of the work in theoretical physics is developing mathematical 
models — frequently including simplifications that aren’t necessarily 
realistic — that can be used to predict the results of future experiments. 
When physicists “observe” a particle, they’re really looking at data that con­
tains a set of numbers that they have interpreted as having certain character­
istics. When they look into the heavens, they receive energy readings that fit 
certain parameters and explanations. To a physicist, these aren’t “just” num­
bers; they’re clues to understanding the universe.

56
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
High-energy physics (which includes string theory and other physics at high 
energies) has an intense interplay between theoretical insights and experi­
mental observations. Research papers in this area fall into one of four 
categories:
	
✓	Experiment
	
✓	Lattice (computer simulations)
	
✓	Phenomenology
	
✓	Theory
Phenomenology is the study of phenomena (no one ever said physicists were 
creative when it comes to naming conventions) and relating them within the 
framework of an existing theory. In other words, scientists focus on taking 
the existing theory and applying it to the existing facts or build models 
describing anticipated facts that may be discovered soon. Then they make 
predictions about what experimental observations should be obtained. (Of 
course, phenomenology has a lot more to it, but this is the basics of what you 
need to know to understand it in relation to string theory.) It’s an intriguing 
discipline, and one that has, in recent years, begun to focus on supersym­
metry and string theory. When I discuss how to possibly test string theory 
in Chapter 12, it is largely the work of phenomenologists that tells scientists 
what they’re looking for.
Though scientific research can be conducted with these different methods, 
there is certainly overlap. Phenomenologists can work on pure theory and 
can also, of course, prepare a computer simulation. Also, in some ways, a 
computer simulation can be viewed as a process that is both experimental 
and theoretical. But what all of these approaches have in common is that the 
scientific results are expressed in the language of science: mathematics.
The rule of simplicity
In science, one goal is to propose the fewest “entities” or rules needed to 
explain how something works. In many ways, the history of science is seen as 
a progression of simplifying the complex array of natural laws into fewer and 
fewer fundamental laws.
	
Take Occam’s razor, which is a principle developed in the 14th century by 
Franciscan friar and logician William of Occam. His “law of parsimony” is 
basically translated (from Latin) as “entities must not be multiplied beyond 
necessity.” (In other words, keep it simple.) Albert Einstein famously stated 
a similar rule as “Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.” 
Though not a scientific law itself, Occam’s razor tends to guide how scientists 
formulate their theories.

57
 Chapter 4: Putting String Theory in Context
In some ways, string theory seems to violate Occam’s razor. For example, in 
order for string theory to work, it requires the addition of a lot of odd com­
ponents (extra dimensions, new particles, and other features mentioned in 
Chapters 10 and 11) that scientists haven’t actually observed yet. However, if 
these components are indeed necessary, then string theory is in accord with 
Occam’s razor.
The role of objectivity in science
Some people believe that science is purely objective. And, of course, science 
is objective in the sense that the principles of science can be applied in the 
same way by anyone and get the same results. But the idea that scientists 
are themselves inherently objective is a nice thought, but it’s about as true 
as the notion of pure objectivity in journalism. The debate over string theory 
demonstrates that the discussion isn’t always purely objective. At its core, 
the debate is over different opinions about how to view science.
In truth, scientists make choices continually that are subjective, such as 
which questions to pursue. For example, when string theory founder Leonard 
Susskind met Nobel Prize winner Murray Gell-Mann, Gell-Mann laughed at 
the very idea of vibrating strings. Two years later, Gell-Mann wanted to hear 
more about it.
In other words, physicists are people. They have learned a difficult discipline, 
but this doesn’t make them infallible or immune to pride, passion, or any 
other human foible. The motivation for their decisions may be financial, aes­
thetic, personal, or any other reason that influences human decisions.
The degree to which a scientist relies on theory versus experiment in guid­
ing his activities is another subjective choice. Einstein, for example, spoke of 
the ways in which only the “free inventions of the mind” (pure physical prin­
ciples, conceived in the mind and aided by the precise application of math­
ematics) could be used to perceive the deeper truths of nature in ways that 
pure experiment never could. Of course, had experiments never confirmed 
his “free inventions,” it’s unlikely that I or anyone else would be citing him a 
century later.
Understanding How Scientific 
Change Is Viewed
The debates over string theory represent fundamental differences in how 
to view science. As the first part of this chapter points out, many people 
have proposed ideas about what the goals of science should be. But over 

58
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
the years, science changes as new ideas are introduced, and it’s in trying to 
understand the nature of these changes where the meaning of science really 
comes into question.
The methods in which scientists adapt old ideas and adopt new ones can 
also be viewed in different ways, and string theory is all about adapting old 
ideas and adopting new ones.
Old becomes new again: 
Science as revolution
The interplay between experiment and theory is never so obvious as in those 
realms where they fail to match up. At that point, unless the experiment con­
tained a flaw, scientists have no choice but to adapt the existing theory to fit 
the new evidence. The old theory must transform into a new theory. The phi­
losopher of science Thomas Kuhn spoke of such transformations as scientific 
revolutions.
In Kuhn’s model (which not all scientists agree with), science progresses 
along until it accumulates a number of experimental problems that make sci­
entists redefine the theories that science operates under. These overarching 
theories are scientific paradigms, and the transition from one paradigm to a 
new one is a period of upheaval in science. In this view, string theory would 
be a new scientific paradigm, and physicists would be in the middle of the 
scientific revolution where it gains dominance.
A scientific paradigm, as proposed by Kuhn in his 1962 The Structure of 
Scientific Revolutions, is a period of business as usual for science. A theory 
explains how nature works, and scientists work within this framework.
Kuhn views the Baconian scientific method — regular puzzle-solving 
activities — as taking place within an existing scientific paradigm. The scien­
tist gains facts and uses the rules of the scientific paradigm to explain them.
The problem is that there always seems to be a handful of facts that the sci­
entific paradigm can’t explain. A few pieces of data don’t seem to fit. During 
the periods of normal science, scientists do their best to explain this data, to 
incorporate it into the existing framework, but they aren’t overly concerned 
about these occasional anomalies.
That’s fine when there are only a few such problems, but when enough of 
them pile up, it can pose serious problems for the prevailing theory.

59
 Chapter 4: Putting String Theory in Context
As these abnormalities begin to accumulate, the activity of normal science 
becomes disrupted and eventually reaches the point where a full scientific 
revolution takes place. In a scientific revolution, the current scientific para­
digm is replaced by a new one that offers a different conceptual model of 
how nature functions.
At some point, scientists can’t just proceed with business as usual anymore, 
and they’re forced to look for new ways to interpret the data. Initially, scien­
tists attempt to do this with minor modifications to the existing theory. They 
can tack on an exception here or a special case there. But if there are enough 
anomalies, and if these makeshift fixes don’t resolve all the problems, scien­
tists are forced to build a new theoretical framework.
	
In other words, they are forced not only to amend their theory, but to con­
struct an entirely new paradigm. It isn’t just that some factual details were 
wrong, but their most basic assumptions were wrong. In a period of scientific 
revolution, scientists begin to question everything they thought they knew 
about nature. For example, in Chapter 10 you see that string theorists have 
been forced to question the number of dimensions in the universe.
Combining forces: Science as unification
Science can be seen as a progressive series of unifications between ideas 
that were, at one point, seen as separate and distinct. For example, biochem­
istry came about by applying the study of chemistry to systems in biology. 
Together with zoology, this yields genetics and neo-darwinism — the modern 
theory of evolution by natural selection, the cornerstone of biology.
In this way, we know that all biological systems are fundamentally chemical 
systems. And all chemical systems, in turn, come from combining different 
atoms to form molecules that ultimately follow the assorted laws defined in 
the Standard Model of particle physics.
Physics, because it studies the most fundamental aspects of nature, is the 
science most interested in these principles of unification. String theory, if 
successful, might unify all fundamental physical forces of the universe down 
to one single equation.
Galileo and Newton unified the heavens and Earth in their work in astronomy, 
defining the motion of heavenly bodies and firmly establishing that Earth fol­
lowed exactly the same rules as all other bodies in our solar system. Michael 
Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell unified the concepts of electricity and mag­
netism into a single concept governed by uniform laws — electromagnetism. (If 
you want more information on gravity or electromagnetism, you’ll be attracted 
to Chapter 5.)

60
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Albert Einstein, with the help of his old teacher Hermann Minkowski, uni­
fied the notions of space and time as dimensions of space-time, through his 
theory of special relativity. In the same year, as part of the same theory, he 
unified the concepts of mass and energy as well. Years later, in his general 
theory of relativity, he unified gravitational force and special relativity into 
one theory.
Central to quantum physics is the notion that particles and waves aren’t the 
separate phenomena that they appear to be. Instead, particles and waves 
can be seen as the same unified phenomenon, viewed differently in different 
circumstances.
The unification continued in the Standard Model of particle physics, when 
electromagnetism was ultimately unified with the strong and weak nuclear 
forces into a single framework.
	
This process of unification has been astoundingly successful, because nearly 
everything in nature can be traced back to the Standard Model — except for 
gravity. String theory, if successful, will be the ultimate unification theory, 
finally bringing gravity into harmony with the other forces.
What happens when you 
break it? Science as symmetry
A symmetry exists when you can take something, transform it in some way, 
and nothing seems to change about the situation. The principle of symme­
try is crucial to the study of physics and has special implications for string 
theory in particular. When a transformation to the system causes a change in 
the situation, scientists say that it represents a broken symmetry.
This is obvious in geometry. Take a circle and draw a line through its center, 
as in Figure 4-1. Now picture flipping the circle around that line. The resulting 
image is identical to the original image when flipped about the line. This is 
linear or reflection symmetry. If you were to spin the figure 180 degrees, you’d 
end up with the same image again. This is rotational symmetry. The trapezoid, 
on the other hand, has asymmetry (or lacks symmetry) because no rotation 
or reflection of the shape will yield the original shape.
The most fundamental form of symmetry in physics is the idea of transla­
tional symmetry, which is where you take an object and move it from one 
location in space to another. If I move from one location to another, the laws 
of physics should be the same in both places. This principle is how scientists 
use laws discovered on Earth to study the distant universe.

61
 Chapter 4: Putting String Theory in Context
	
Figure 4-1: 
The circle 
has symme-
try, but the 
trapezoid 
doesn’t.
	
In physics, though, symmetry means way more than just taking an object and 
flipping, spinning, or sliding it through space.
The most detailed studies of energy in the universe indicate that, no matter 
which direction you look, space is basically the same in all directions. The 
universe itself seems to have been symmetric from the very beginning.
	
The laws of physics don’t change over time (at least according to most physi­
cists and certainly not on short timescales, like a human lifetime or the entire 
age of the United States of America). If I perform an experiment today and per­
form the same experiment tomorrow, I’ll get essentially the same result. The 
laws of physics possess a basic symmetry with respect to time. Changing the 
time of something doesn’t change the behavior of the system, though I discuss 
some potential exceptions in Chapter 16.
These and other symmetries are seen as central to the study of science, and 
in fact, many physicists have stated that symmetry is the single most impor­
tant concept for physics to grasp.
The truth is that while physicists often speak of the elegance of symmetry 
in the universe, the string theorist Leonard Susskind is quite right when he 
points out that things get interesting when the symmetry breaks.
In fact, as I was preparing for this book, the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics was 
awarded to three physicists — Yoichiro Nambu, Makoto Kobayashi, and 
Toshihide Maskawa — for work in broken symmetry performed decades ago.
Without broken symmetry, everything would be absolutely uniform every­
where. The very fact that we have a chemistry that allows us to exist is proof 
that some aspects of symmetry don’t hold up in the universe.
Many theoretical physicists believe that a symmetry exists between the four 
fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, strong 
nuclear force), a symmetry that broke early in the universe’s formation and 
causes the differences we see today. String theory is the primary (if not 

62
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
the only) means of understanding that broken symmetry, if it does (or did) 
indeed exist.
This broken symmetry may be closely linked to supersymmetry, which is 
necessary for string theory to become viable. Supersymmetry has been inves­
tigated in many areas of theoretical physics, even though there’s no direct 
experimental evidence for it, because it ensures that the theory includes 
many desirable properties.
Supersymmetry and the unification of forces are at the heart of the string 
theory story. As you read more about string theory, it’s up to you to deter­
mine whether the lack of experimental evidence condemns it from the start.

o matter how complex modern physics concepts get, they have their 
roots in basic classical concepts. To understand the revolutions lead­
ing up to string theory, you need to first understand these basic concepts. 
You’ll then be able to understand how string theory recovers and generalizes 
them.
In this chapter, I present some physics concepts that you need to be familiar 
with to understand string theory. First, I discuss three fundamental concepts in 
physics: matter, energy, and how they interact. Next I explain waves and vibra­
tions, which are crucial to understanding stringy behavior. Gravity is also key, 
so Sir Isaac Newton’s key discoveries come next. Finally, I give a brief overview 
of electromagnetic radiation, an important aspect of physics that leads directly 
into the discovery of both relativity and quantum physics — the two theories 
that together give birth to modern string theory!
This Crazy Little Thing Called Physics
Physics is the study of matter and its interactions. Physics tries to under­
stand the behavior of physical systems from the most fundamental laws that 
we can achieve. String theory could provide the most fundamental law and 
explain all of the universe in a single mathematical equation and physical 
theory.

64
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
One other key principle of physics is the idea that many of the laws that 
work in one location also work in another location — a principle known as 
symmetry (I cover this in more detail later in this section and also in Chapter 
4). This connection between physics in different locations is just one sort of 
symmetry, allowing physics concepts to be related to each other. Science 
has progressed by taking diverse concepts and unifying them into cohesive 
physical laws.
This is a very broad definition of physics, but then physics is the broadest 
science. Because everything you see, hear, smell, touch, taste, or in any way 
interact with is made of matter and interacts according to some sort of rules, 
that means that physics is literally the study of anything that happens. In a 
way, chemistry and all the other sciences are approximations of the funda­
mental laws of physics.
	
Even if string theory (or some other “theory of everything”) were to be found, 
there would still be need for other sciences. Trying to figure out every single 
physical system from string theory would be as absurd as trying to study the 
weather by analyzing every single atom in the atmosphere.
No laughing matter: What we’re made of
One of the traits of matter (the “stuff” that everything is made of) is that it 
requires force to do something. (There are some exceptions to this, but as 
a rule a force is any influence that produces a change, or prevents a change, 
in a physical quantity.) Mass is the property that allows matter to resist a 
change in motion (in other words, the ability to resist force). Another key 
trait of matter is that it’s conserved, meaning it can’t be created or destroyed, 
but can only change forms. (Einstein’s relativity showed this wasn’t entirely 
true, as you see in Chapter 6.)
Without matter, the universe would be a pretty boring place. Matter is all 
around you. The book you’re reading, as you lean back comfortably in your 
matter-laden chair, is made of matter. You yourself are made of matter. But 
what, exactly, is this stuff called matter?
Early philosophers and scientists try to understand matter
The question of matter’s meaning dates back to at least the Greeks and 
Chinese philosophers, who wondered what made one thing different from 
another. Greek and Chinese thinkers noticed similar trends, and each devised 
a system for categorizing matter into five fundamental elements based on 
these common traits.
In ancient China, the five elements were metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. 
Eastern religion and philosophy used these elements and the different ways 
they interact to explain not only the natural world but also the moral realm.

65
 Chapter 5: What You Must Know about Classical Physics
Among the Greek philosophers, Aristotle is the most popular to have dis­
cussed their version of the five elements: fire, earth, air, water, and aether. 
Aether was supposedly an unearthly, spiritual substance that filled the uni­
verse. In this view of matter, the realm outside of Earth was composed of this 
aether and didn’t undergo change the way our world does.
On Earth, material objects were seen as combinations of the basic elements. 
For example, mud was a combination of water and earth. A cloud was a com­
bination of air and water. Lava was a combination of earth and fire.
In the 17th century, scientists’ understanding of matter started to change 
as astronomers and physicists began to realize that the same laws govern 
matter both on Earth and in space. The universe isn’t composed of eternal, 
unchanging, unearthly aether, but of hard balls of ordinary matter.
Newton’s key insight into the study of matter was that it resisted change in 
motion (I explain this in more detail in the later “Force, mass, and accelera­
tion: Putting objects into motion” section). The degree to which an object 
resists this change in motion is its mass.
Scientists discover that mass can’t be destroyed
Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier’s work in the 18th century provided physics with 
another great insight into matter. Lavoisier and his wife, Marie Anne, per­
formed extensive experiments that indicated that matter can’t be destroyed; 
it merely changes from one form to another. This principle is called the con­
servation of mass.
This isn’t an obvious property. If you burn a log, when you look at the pile of 
ash, it certainly looks like you have a lot less matter than you started with. 
But, indeed, Lavoisier found that if you’re extremely careful that you don’t 
misplace any of the pieces — including the pieces that normally float away 
during the act of burning — you end up with as much mass at the end of the 
burning as you started with.
Over and over again, Lavoisier showed this unexpected trait of matter to 
be the case, so much so that we now take it for granted as a familiar part of 
our universe. Water may boil from liquid into gas, but the particles of water 
continue to exist and can, if care is taken, be reconstituted back into liquid. 
Matter can change form, but can’t be destroyed (at least not until nuclear 
reactions, which weren’t discovered until well after Lavoisier’s time).
As the study of matter progresses through time, things grow stranger instead 
of more familiar. In Chapter 8, I discuss the modern understanding of matter, 
in which we are composed mostly of tiny particles that are linked together 
with invisible forces across vast (from their scale) empty distances. In fact, 
as string theory suggests, it’s possible that even those tiny particles aren’t 
really there — at least not in the way we normally picture them.

Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Add a little energy: Why stuff happens
The matter in our universe would never do anything interesting if it weren’t 
for the addition of energy. There would be no change from hot to cold or 
from fast to slow. Energy too is conserved, as discovered through the 1800s 
as the laws of thermodynamics were explored, but the story of energy’s con­
servation is more elusive than that of matter. You can see matter, but track­
ing energy proves to be trickier.
Kinetic energy is the energy involved when an object is in motion. Potential 
energy is the energy contained within an object, waiting to be turned into 
kinetic energy. It turns out that the total energy — kinetic energy plus poten­
tial energy — is conserved any time a physical system undergoes a change.
String theory makes predictions about physical systems that contain a large 
amount of energy, packed into a very small space. The energies needed for 
string theory predictions are so large that it might never be possible to con­
struct a device able to generate that much energy and test the predictions.
The energy of motion: Kinetic energy
Kinetic energy is most obvious in the case of large objects, but it’s true at 
all size levels. (I mean large objects in comparison to particles, so a grain of 
sand and the planet both would be considered large in this case.) Heat (or 
thermal energy) is really just a bunch of atoms moving rapidly, representing 
a form of kinetic energy. When water is heated, the particles accelerate until 
they break free of the bonds with other water molecules and become a gas. 
The motion of particles can cause energy to emit in different forms, such as 
when a burning piece of coal glows white hot.
Sound is another form of kinetic energy. If two billiard balls collide, the par­
ticles in the air will be forced to move, resulting in a noise. All around us, par­
ticles in motion are responsible for what takes place in our universe.
Stored energy: Potential energy
Potential energy, on the other hand, is stored energy. Potential energy takes 
a lot more forms than kinetic energy and can be a bit trickier to understand.
A spring, for example, has potential energy when it’s stretched out or com­
pressed. When the spring is released, the potential energy transforms into 
kinetic energy as the spring moves into its least energetic length.
Moving an object in a gravitational field changes the amount of poten­
tial energy stored in it. A penny held out from the top of the Empire State 
Building has a great deal of potential energy due to gravity, which turns into 
a great deal of kinetic energy when dropped (although not, as evidenced 
on an episode of MythBusters, enough to kill an unsuspecting pedestrian on 
impact).

67
 Chapter 5: What You Must Know about Classical Physics
This may sound a bit odd, talking about something having more or less 
energy just because of where it is, but the environment is part of the physical 
system described by the physics equations. These equations tell exactly how 
much potential energy is stored in different physical systems, and they can 
be used to determine outcomes when the potential energy gets released.
Symmetry: Why some laws 
were made to be broken
A change in location or position that retains the properties of the system is 
called a geometric symmetry (or sometimes translational symmetry). Another 
form of symmetry is an internal symmetry, which is when something within 
the system can be swapped for something else and the system (as a whole) 
doesn’t change. When a symmetrical situation at high energy collapses into 
a lower energy ground state that is asymmetrical, it’s called spontaneous sym­
metry breaking. An example would be when a roulette wheel spins and slows 
into a “ground state.” The ball ultimately settles into one slot in the wheel — 
and the gambler either wins or loses.
String theory goes beyond the symmetries we observe to predict even more 
symmetries that aren’t observed in nature. It predicts a necessary sym­
metry that’s not observed in nature, called supersymmetry. At the energies 
we observe, supersymmetry is an example of a broken symmetry, though 
physicists believe that in high-energy situations, the supersymmetry would 
no longer be broken (which is what makes it so interesting to study). I cover 
supersymmetry in Chapters 2 and 10.
Translational symmetry: Same system, different spot
If an object has translational symmetry, you can move it and it continues to 
look the same (for a detailed explanation of this, flip to Chapter 4). Moving 
objects in space doesn’t change the physical properties of the system.
Now, didn’t I just say in the last section that the potential energy due to grav­
ity changes depending on where an object is? Yes, I did. Moving an object’s 
location in space can have an impact on the physical system, but the laws of 
physics themselves don’t change (so far as we can tell). If the Empire State 
Building, Earth, and the penny held over the edge (the entire “system” in this 
example) were all shifted by the same amount in the same direction, there 
would be no noticeable change to the system.
Internal symmetry: The system changes, 
but the outcome stays the same
In an internal symmetry, some property of the system can undergo a change 
without changing the outcome of the result.

68
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
For example, changing every particle with its antiparticle — changing posi­
tive charges to negative and negative charges to positive — leaves the elec­
tromagnetic forces involved completely identical. This is a form of internal 
symmetry, called charge conjugation symmetry. Most internal symmetries 
aren’t perfect symmetries, meaning that they behave somewhat differently in 
some situations.
Spontaneous symmetry breaking: A gradual breakdown
Physicists believe that the laws of the universe used to be even more sym­
metric, but have gone through a process called spontaneous symmetry break­
ing, where the symmetry falls apart in the universe we observe.
If everything were perfectly symmetric, the universe would be a very boring 
place. The slight differences in the universe — the broken symmetries — are 
what make the natural world so interesting, but when physicists look at the 
physical laws, they tend to find that the differences are fairly small in com­
parison to the similarities.
	
To understand spontaneous symmetry breaking, consider a pencil perfectly 
balanced on its tip. The pencil is in a state of perfect balance, of equilibrium, 
but it’s unstable. Any tiny disturbance will cause it to fall over. However, no 
law of physics says which way the pencil will fall. The situation is perfectly 
symmetrical because all directions are equal.
As soon as the pencil starts to fall, however, definite laws of physics dictate 
the direction it will continue to fall. The symmetrical situation spontaneously 
(and, for all intents and purposes, randomly) begins to collapse into one defi­
nite, asymmetrical form. As the system collapses, the other options are no 
longer available to the system.
The Standard Model of particle physics, as well as string theory (which 
includes the Standard Model as a low-energy approximation), predicts that 
some properties of the universe were once highly symmetrical but have under­
gone spontaneous symmetry breaking into the universe we observe now.
All Shook Up: Waves and Vibrations
In string theory, the most fundamental objects are tiny strings of energy that 
vibrate or oscillate in regular patterns. In physics, such systems are called 
harmonic oscillators, and much work has been done to study them.
	
Though the strings of string theory are different, understanding the vibrations 
of classical objects — like air, water, jump-ropes, springs — can help you 
understand the behavior of these exotic little creatures when you encounter 
them. These classical objects can carry what are called mechanical waves.

69
 Chapter 5: What You Must Know about Classical Physics
Catching the wave
Waves (as we usually think of them) move through some sort of medium. If 
you flick the end of a jump-rope or string, a wave moves along the rope or 
string. Waves move through the water, or sound waves through the air, with 
those materials acting as the medium for the wave motion.
In classical physics, waves transport energy, but not matter, from one region 
to another. One set of water molecules transfers its energy to the nearby 
water molecules, which means that the wave moves through the water, even 
though the actual water molecules don’t actually travel all the way from the 
start of the wave to the end of the wave.
This is even more obvious if I were to take the end of a jump-rope and shake 
it, causing a wave to travel along its length. Clearly, the molecules at my end 
of the jump-rope aren’t traveling along it. Each group of jump-rope molecules 
is nudging the next group of jump-rope molecules, and the end result is the 
wave motion along its length.
There are two types of mechanical waves, as shown in Figure 5-1:
	
✓	Transverse wave: A wave in which the displacement of the medium is 
perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave along the medium, 
like the flicking of a jump-rope.
	
✓	Longitudinal wave: A wave that moves in the same direction in which 
the wave travels, like a piston pushing on a cylinder of water.
	
Figure 5-1: 
Waves 
come in 
two types: 
transverse, 
shown on 
top, and 
longitudinal, 
shown on 
the bottom.
	
Transverse wave
Amplitude
Longitudinal wave
Wavelength
The highest point on a transverse wave (or the densest point in a longitudi­
nal wave) is called a crest. The lowest point on a transverse wave (or the least 
dense point in a longitudinal wave) is called a trough.
The displacement from the resting point to the crest — in other words, how 
high the wave gets — is called the amplitude. The distance from one crest to 

70
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
another (or one trough to another) is called the wavelength. These values are 
shown on the transverse wave in Figure 5-1. The wavelength is shown on the 
longitudinal wave, as well, although the amplitude is hard to show on that 
type of wave, so it isn’t included.
Another useful thing to consider is the velocity (speed and direction) of the 
wave. This can be determined by its wavelength and frequency, which is a 
measure of how many times the wave passes a given point per second. If you 
know the frequency and the wavelength, you can calculate the velocity. This, 
in turn, allows you to calculate the energy contained within the wave.
Another trait of many waves is the principle of superposition, which states 
that when two waves overlap, the total displacement is the sum of the indi­
vidual displacements, as shown in Figure 5-2. This property is also referred to 
as wave interference.
	
Figure 5-2: 
When two 
waves 
overlap, the 
total dis-
placement 
is the sum 
of the two 
individual 
displace-
ments.
	
Wave #1
Wave #2
Addition of Wave #1 and Wave #2
Consider waves when two ships cross each other’s path. The waves made by 
the ships cause the water to become choppier, and as the waves add height 
to each other, they cause massive swells.
	
Similarly, sometimes waves can cancel each other out. If the crest of wave 1 
overlaps with the trough of wave 2, they cancel each other out at that point. 
This sort of interference plays a key role in one of the quantum physics prob­
lems I discuss in Chapter 7 — the double slit experiment.
Getting some good vibrations
String theory depicts strings of energy that vibrate, but the strings are so tiny 
that you never perceive the vibrations directly, only their consequences. To 

71
 Chapter 5: What You Must Know about Classical Physics
understand these vibrations, you have to understand a classical type of wave 
called a standing wave — a wave that doesn’t appear to be moving.
In a standing wave, certain points, called nodes, don’t appear to move at 
all. Other points, called antinodes, have the maximum displacement. The 
arrangement of nodes and antinodes determines the properties of various 
types of standing waves.
The simplest example of a standing wave is one with a node on each end, 
such as a string that’s fixed in place on the ends and plucked. When there is a 
node on each end and only one antinode in between them, the wave is said to 
vibrate at the fundamental frequency.
Consider a jump-rope that is held at each end by a child. The ends of the 
rope represent nodes because they don’t move much. The center of the rope 
is the antinode, where the displacement is the greatest and where another 
child will attempt to jump in. This is vibration at the fundamental frequency, 
as demonstrated in Figure 5-3a.

Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
If the children get ambitious, however, and begin putting more energy into 
the wave motion of their jump-rope, a curious thing happens. Eventually, the 
children will pump enough energy into the rope that instead of one large anti­
node, two smaller antinodes are created, and the center of the rope seems to 
be at rest, as shown in Figure 5-3b. It’s almost as if someone grabbed hold of 
the middle of the rope and gingerly, but firmly, is holding it in place!
A second type of standing wave can be considered if instead of a child hold­
ing each end of the rope, one end is mounted on a ring around a pole. The 
child holding one end begins the wave motion, but the end on the pole is 
now unconstrained and moves up and down. Instead of having a node on 
each end, one end is a node (held by the child) and the other is an antinode 
(moving up and down on the pole).
A similar situation in music happens when using a pipe that’s closed at one 
end and open at the other, such as in an organ. A node forms at the closed 
end of the pipe, but the open end of the pipe is always an antinode.
A third type of standing wave has an antinode at each end. This would repre­
sent either a pipe that’s open on both ends or a rope that’s free to move on 
both ends.
The more energy that’s pumped into the standing wave, the more nodes form 
(see Figure 5-3c). The series of frequencies that cause new nodes to form are 
called harmonics. (In music, harmonics are called overtones.) The waves that 
correspond to harmonics are called normal modes, or vibrational modes.
Music works because of the manipulation and superposition of harmonic 
overtones created by these normal modes of vibration. The first three normal 
modes are shown in Figure 5-3, where a string is fixed on both ends.
	
In string theory, the vibrational modes of strings (and other objects) are simi­
lar to those that I’m talking about in this chapter. In fact, matter itself is seen 
as the manifestation of standing waves on strings. Different vibrational modes 
give rise to different particles! We perceive the particles from the lowest vibra­
tional modes, but with higher energies, we may be able to detect other, higher-
energy particles.
Newton’s Revolution: How 
Physics Was Born
Many see Sir Isaac Newton’s discoveries as the start of modern physics 
(along with a bit of help from his predecessor, Galileo Galilei). Newton’s dis­
coveries dominated two centuries of physics, until Albert Einstein took his 
place at the apex of scientific greatness.

73
 Chapter 5: What You Must Know about Classical Physics
Newton’s accomplishments are diverse, but he’s known largely for four cru­
cial discoveries that define the realm of physics even today:
	
✓	Three laws of motion
	
✓	Law of universal gravitation
	
✓	Optics
	
✓	Calculus
Each of these discoveries has elements that will prove important as you 
attempt to understand the later discoveries of string theory.
Force, mass, and acceleration: 
Putting objects into motion
Newton formulated three laws of motion, which showed his understanding 
of the real meaning of motion and how it relates to force. Under his laws of 
motion, a force created a proportional acceleration on an object.
This understanding was a necessary foundation upon which his law of grav­
ity was built (see the next section). In fact, both were introduced in his 1686 
book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, a title that translates into 
Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. This book has become known 
by the shorter title Principia in physics circles.
The second law of motion says that the force required to accelerate an object 
is the product of the mass and acceleration, expressed by the equation F = 
ma, where F is the total force, m is the object’s mass, and a is the accelera­
tion. To figure out the total acceleration on an object, you figure out the total 
forces acting on it and then divide by the mass.
	
Strictly speaking, Newton said that force was equal to the change in momen­
tum of an object. In calculus, this is the derivative of momentum with respect 
to time. Momentum is equal to mass times velocity. Because mass is assumed 
to be constant and the derivative of velocity with respect to time yields the 
acceleration, the popular F = ma equation is a simplified way of looking at this 
situation.
	
This equation can also be used to define mass. If I take a force and divide it by 
the acceleration it causes on an object, I can determine the mass of the object. 
One question which string theorists hope to answer is why some objects have 
mass and others (such as the photon) do not.

74
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Gravity: A great discovery
With the laws of motion in hand, Newton was able to perform the action that 
would make him the greatest physicist of his age: explaining the motion of 
the heavens and the Earth. His proposal was the law of universal gravitation, 
which defines a force acting between two objects based on their masses and 
the distance separating them.
The more massive the objects, the higher the gravitational force is. The rela­
tionship with distance is an inverse relationship, meaning that as the distance 
increases, the force drops off. (It actually drops off with the square of the 
distance — so it drops off very quickly as objects are separated.) The closer 
two objects are, the higher the gravitational force is.
The strength of the gravitational force determines a value in Newton’s equa­
tion, called the gravitational constant or Newton’s constant. This value is 
obtained by performing experiments and observations, and calculating what 
the constant should be. One question still open to physics and string theory 
is why gravity is so weak compared to other forces.
	
Gravity seems fairly straightforward, but it actually causes quite a few prob­
lems for physicists, because it won’t behave itself and get along with the other 
forces of the universe. Newton himself wasn’t comfortable with the idea of a 
force acting at a distance, without understanding the mechanism involved. 
But the equations, even without a thorough explanation for what caused it, 
worked. In fact, the equations worked well enough that for more than two 
centuries, until Einstein, no one could figure out what was missing from the 
theory. More on this in Chapter 6.
Newton makes some laws about motion
The second law, and the way it relates force, 
acceleration, and mass, is the only law of 
motion relevant to a string theory discussion. 
However, for true Newton-o-philes, here are 
the other two laws of motion, paraphrased for 
ease of understanding:
	✓	Newton’s first law of motion: An object at 
rest remains at rest, or an object in motion 
remains in motion, unless acted upon by 
an external force. In other words, it takes a 
force to cause motion to change.
	✓	Newton’s third law of motion: When two 
objects interact through a force, each 
object exerts a force on the other object 
that is equal and opposite. In other words, 
if I exert a force on the wall with my hand, 
the wall exerts an equal force back on my 
hand.

75
 Chapter 5: What You Must Know about Classical Physics
Optics: Shedding light on light’s properties
Newton also performed extensive work in understanding the properties of 
light, a field known as optics. Newton supported a view that light moved as 
tiny particles, as opposed to a theory that light traveled as a wave. Newton 
performed all of his work in optics assuming that light moved as tiny balls of 
energy flying through the air.
For nearly a century, Newton’s view of light as particles dominated, until 
Thomas Young’s experiments in the early 1800s demonstrated that light 
exhibited the properties of waves, namely the principle of superposition (see 
the earlier “Catching the wave” section for more on superposition and the 
later “Light as a wave: The ether theory” section for more on light waves).
The understanding of light, which began with Newton, would lead to the 
revolutions in physics by Albert Einstein and, ultimately, to the ideas at the 
heart of string theory. In string theory, both gravity and light are caused by 
the behavior of strings.
Calculus and mathematics: Enhancing 
scientific understanding
To study the physical world, Newton had to develop new mathematical 
tools. One of the tools he developed was a type of math that we call calculus. 
Actually, at the same time he invented it, philosopher and mathematician 
Gottfried Leibniz had also created calculus completely independently! Newton 
needed calculus to perform his analysis of the natural world. Leibniz, on the 
other hand, developed it mainly to explain certain geometric problems.
	
Think for a moment how amazing this really is. A purely mathematical con­
struct, like calculus, provided key insights into the physical systems that 
Newton explored. Alternately, the physical analysis that Newton performed 
led him to create calculus. In other words, this is a case where mathematics 
and science seemed to help build upon each other! One of the major suc­
cesses of string theory is that it has provided motivation for important math­
ematical developments that have gone on to be useful in other realms.
The Forces of Light: Electricity 
and Magnetism
In the 19th century, the physical understanding of the nature of light changed 
completely. Experiments began to show strong cases where light acted like 

76
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
waves instead of particles, which contradicted Newton (see the “Optics: 
Shedding light on light’s properties” section for more on Newton’s findings). 
During the same time, experiments into electricity and magnetism began to 
reveal that these forces behaved like light, except that we couldn’t see them!
By the end of the 19th century, it became clear that electricity and magne­
tism were different manifestations of the same force: electromagnetism. One 
of the goals of string theory is to develop a single theory that incorporates 
both electromagnetism and gravity.
Light as a wave: The ether theory
Newton had treated light as particles, but experiments in the 19th century 
began to show that light acted like a wave. The major problem with this was 
that waves require a medium. Something has to do the waving. Light seemed 
to travel through empty space, which contained no substance at all. What 
was the medium that light used to move through? What was waving?
To explain the problem, physicists proposed that space was filled with a sub­
stance. When looking for a name for this hypothetical substance, physicists 
turned back to Aristotle and named it luminous ether. (Some physicists con­
tinued to spell it aether, but I call it ether to distinguish it from Aristotle’s fifth 
element.)
Even with this hypothetical ether, though, there were still problems. 
Newton’s optics still worked, and his theory described light in terms of tiny 
balls moving in straight lines, not as waves! It seemed that sometimes light 
acted like a wave and sometimes it acted as a particle.
Most physicists of the 19th century believed in the wave theory, largely 
because the study of electricity and magnetism helped support the idea that 
light was a wave, but they were unable to find solid evidence of the ether.
Invisible lines of force: Electric 
and magnetic fields
Electricity is the study of how charged particles affect each other. Magnetism, 
on the other hand, is the study of how magnetized objects affect each other. 
In the 19th century, research began to show that these two seemingly sepa­
rate phenomena were, in fact, different aspects of the same thing. The physi­
cist Michael Faraday proposed that invisible fields transmitted the force.

77
 Chapter 5: What You Must Know about Classical Physics
Electricity and magnetism are linked together
An electrical force acts between two objects that contain a property called 
electrical charge that can be either positive or negative. Positive charges 
repel other positive charges, and negative charges repel other negative 
charges, but positive and negative charges attract each other, as in Figure 5-4.
Coulomb’s Law, which describes the simplest behavior of the electric force 
between charged particles (a field called electrostatics), is an inverse square 
law, similar to Newton’s law of gravity. This provided some of the first 
inklings that gravity and electrostatic forces (and, ultimately, electromagne­
tism) might have something in common.

When electrical charges move, they create an electrical current. These cur­
rents can influence each other through a magnetic force. This was discovered 
by Hans Christian Oersted, who found that a wire with an electrical current 
running through it could deflect the needle of a compass.
Later work by Michael Faraday and others showed that this worked the other 
way, as well — a magnetic force can influence an electrical current. As dem­
onstrated in Figure 5-5, moving a magnet toward a conducting loop of wire 
causes a current to run through the wire.

Faraday proposes force fields to explain these forces
In the 1840s, Michael Faraday proposed the idea that invisible lines of force 
were at work in electrical currents and magnetism. These hypothetical lines 
made up a force field that had a certain value and direction at any given point 
and could be used to calculate the total force acting on a particle at that 
point. This concept was quickly adapted to also apply to gravity in the form 
of a gravitational field.
	
These invisible lines of force were responsible for the electrical force (as 
shown in Figure 5-6) and magnetic force (as shown in Figure 5-7). They 
resulted in an electric field and a magnetic field that could be measured.

Faraday proposed the invisible lines of force, but wasn’t nearly as clear on 
how the force was transmitted, which drew ridicule from his peers. Keep in 
mind, though, that Newton also couldn’t fully explain how gravity was trans­
mitted, so there was precedent to this. Action at a distance was already an 
established part of physics, and Faraday, at least, was proposing a physical 
model of how it could take place.

 Chapter 5: What You Must Know about Classical Physics
	
The fields proposed by Faraday turned out to have applications beyond 
electricity and magnetism. Gravity, too, could be written in a field form. The 
benefit of a force field is that every point in space has a value and direction 
associated with it. If you can calculate the value of the field at a point, you 
know exactly how the force will act on an object placed at that point. Today, 
every law of physics can be written in the form of fields.
Maxwell’s equations bring it all together: 
Electromagnetic waves
Physicists now know that electricity and magnetism are both aspects of the 
same electromagnetic force. This force travels in the form of electromagnetic 
waves. We see a certain range of this electromagnetic energy in the form of 
visible light, but there are other forms, such as X-rays and microwaves, that 
we don’t see.
In the mid-1800s, James Clerk Maxwell took the work of Faraday and others 
and created a set of equations, known as Maxwell’s equations, that described 
the forces of electricity and magnetism in term of electromagnetic waves. An 
electromagnetic wave is shown in Figure 5-8.

Maxwell’s equations allowed him to calculate the exact speed that the elec­
tromagnetic wave traveled. When Maxwell performed this calculation, he was 
amazed to find that he recognized the value. Electromagnetic waves moved 
at exactly the speed of light!
	
Maxwell’s equations showed that visible light and electromagnetic waves are 
different manifestations of the same underlying phenomena. In other words, 
we see only a small range of the entire spectrum of electromagnetic waves 
that exist in our universe. Extending this unification to include all the forces of 
nature, including gravity, would ultimately lead to theories of quantum gravity 
such as string theory.

Two dark clouds and the 
birth of modern physics
Two significant unanswered questions with the electromagnetic theory 
remained. The first problem was that the ether hadn’t been detected, while 
the second involved an obscure problem about energy radiation, called the 
blackbody problem (described in Chapter 7). What’s amazing, in retrospect, 
is that physicists didn’t see these problems (or dark clouds as British scien­
tist Lord Kelvin called them in a 1900 speech) as especially significant, but 
instead believed that they were minor issues that would soon be resolved. As 
you see in Chapters 6 and 7, resolving these two problems would introduce 
the great revolutions of modern physics — relativity and quantum physics.

lbert Einstein introduced his theory of relativity to explain the issues 
arising from the electromagnetic concepts introduced in Chapter 5. 
The theory has had far-reaching implications, altering our understanding of 
time and space. It provides a theoretical framework that tells us how grav­
ity works, but it has left open certain questions that string theory hopes to 
answer.
In this book, I give you only a glimpse of relativity — the glimpse needed to 
understand string theory. For a more in-depth look at the fascinating con­
cepts of Einstein’s theory of relativity, I suggest Einstein For Dummies by 
Carlos I. Calle, PhD (Wiley).
In this chapter, I explain how the ether model failed to match experimental 
results and how Einstein introduced special relativity to resolve the problem. 
I discuss Einstein’s theory of gravity in general relativity, including a brief 
look at a rival theory of gravity and how Einstein’s theory was confirmed. 
I then point out some issues arising from relativity. Finally, I introduce a 
theory that tried to unify relativity and electromagnetics and is seen by many 
as a predecessor of string theory.

What Waves Light Waves? 
Searching for the Ether
In the latter part of the 19th century, physicists were searching for the mys­
terious ether — the medium they believed existed for light waves to wave 
through. Their inability to discover this ether, despite good experiments, was 
frustrating, to say the least. Their failure paved the way for Einstein’s expla­
nation, in the form of the theory of relativity.
As I explain in Chapter 5, waves had to pass through a medium, a substance 
that actually did the waving. Light waves pass through “empty space” of a 
vacuum (a space without any air or other regular matter), so physicists had 
predicted a luminous ether that must exist everywhere and be some sort of 
substance that scientists had never before encountered. In other words, the 
“empty space” was not (in the view of the time) really empty because it con­
tained ether.
Some things could be predicted about the ether, though. For example, if 
there was a medium for light, the light was moving through it, like a swim­
mer moving through the water. And, like a swimmer, the light should travel 
slightly faster when going in the same direction as the water’s current than 
when the swimmer is trying to go against the water’s current.
	
This doesn’t mean that the ether itself was moving. Even if the ether was com­
pletely still, Earth was moving within the ether, which is effectively the same 
thing. If you walk through a still body of water, it feels basically the same as if 
you were walking in place and the water was flowing around you. (In fact, they 
now have small pools that use this exact principle. You can swim for hours 
in a pool that’s only a few feet long. Because a powerful current is pumping 
through it, you swim against the current and never go anywhere.)
Physicists wanted to construct an experiment based on this concept that 
would test whether light traveled different speeds in different directions. 
This sort of variation would support the idea that light was traveling through 
an ether medium.
In 1881, physicist Albert Michelson created a device called an interferometer 
designed to do just that. With the help of his colleague Edward Morley, he 
improved the design and precision of the device in 1887. The Michelson-
Morley interferometer is shown in Figure 6-1.

The interferometer used mirrors that were only partially reflective, so they 
let half the light pass through and reflected half the light. The interferometer 
set these mirrors at an angle, splitting a single beam of light so it ended up 
traveling two different paths. The paths traveled perpendicular to each other, 
but ended up hitting the same screen.
In 1887, Michelson and Morley ran a series of tests with the improved inter­
ferometer to discover the ether. They thought that the light traveling along 
one of these paths should be slightly faster than the light traveling along the 
other path, because one of them would be going either with or against the 
ether, and the other path would be perpendicular to the ether. When the 
light hit the screen, each beam would have traveled the exact same distance. 
If one had traveled a slightly different speed, the two beams would be slightly 
out of phase with each other, which would show distinctive wave interfer­
ence patterns — light and dark bands would appear — on the screen.
No matter how many times Michelson and Morley conducted the experi­
ment, they never found this difference in speed for the two light beams. They 
always found the same speed of approximately 670 million miles per hour, 
regardless of the direction the light traveled.
Physicists didn’t immediately dismiss the ether model; instead they (includ­
ing Michelson and Morley) considered it a failed experiment, even though it 
should have worked had there been an ether. In 1900, when Lord Kelvin gave 
his “two dark clouds” speech, 13 years had passed without being able to 
detect the ether’s motion, but it was still assumed that the ether existed.
	
Sometimes scientists are reluctant to give up on a theory that they’ve devoted 
years to, even if the evidence turns against them — something that the critics 
of string theory believe may be happening right now in the theoretical physics 
community.

No Ether? No Problem: Introducing 
Special Relativity
In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper explaining how to have electro­
magnetics work without an ether. This theory came to be known as the theory 
of special relativity, which explains how to interpret motion between differ­
ent inertial frames of reference — that is, places that are moving at constant 
speeds relative to each other.
The key to special relativity was that Einstein explained the laws of phys­
ics when two objects are moving at a constant speed as the relative motion 
between the two objects, instead of appealing to the ether as an absolute 
frame of reference that defined what was going on. If you and some astro­
naut, Amber, are moving in different spaceships and want to compare your 
observations, all that matters is how fast you and Amber are moving with 
respect to each other.
	
Special relativity includes only the special case (hence the name) where 
the motion is uniform. The motion it explains is only if you’re traveling in a 
straight line at a constant speed. As soon as you accelerate or curve — or do 
anything that changes the nature of the motion in any way — special relativ­
ity ceases to apply. That’s where Einstein’s general theory of relativity comes 
in, because it can explain the general case of any sort of motion. (I cover this 
theory later in the chapter.)
Einstein’s 1905 paper that introduced special relativity, “On the 
Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” was based on two key principles:
	
✓	The principle of relativity: The laws of physics don’t change, even for 
objects moving in inertial (constant speed) frames of reference.
	
✓	The principle of the speed of light: The speed of light is the same for 
all observers, regardless of their motion relative to the light source. 
(Physicists write this speed using the symbol c.)
The genius of Einstein’s discoveries is that he looked at the experiments and 
assumed the findings were true. This was the exact opposite of what other 
physicists seemed to be doing. Instead of assuming the theory was correct 
and that the experiments failed, he assumed that the experiments were cor­
rect and the theory had failed.
The ether had caused a mess of things, in Einstein’s view, by introducing a 
medium that caused certain laws of physics to work differently depending 
on how the observer moved relative to the ether. Einstein just removed the 
ether entirely and assumed that the laws of physics, including the speed of 
light equal to c, worked the same way regardless of how you were moving — 
exactly as experiments and mathematics showed them to be!

85
 Chapter 6: Revolutionizing Space and Time: Einstein’s Relativity
Unifying space and time
Einstein’s theory of special relativity created a fundamental link between space 
and time. The universe can be viewed as having three space dimensions — 
up/down, left/right, forward/backward — and one time dimension. This 
4-dimensional space is referred to as the space-time continuum.
If you move fast enough through space, the observations that you make 
about space and time differ somewhat from the observations that other 
people, who are moving at different speeds, make. The formulas Einstein 
used to describe these changes were developed by Hendrik Lorentz (see the 
nearby sidebar, “Giving credit where credit is due”).
	
String theory introduces many more space dimensions, so grasping how the 
dimensions in relativity work is a crucial starting point to understanding some 
of the confusing aspects of string theory. The extra dimensions are so impor­
tant to string theory that they get their own chapter, Chapter 13.
Following the bouncing beam of light
The reason for this space-time link comes from applying the principles of 
relativity and the speed of light very carefully. The speed of light is the dis­
tance light travels divided by the time it takes to travel this path, and (accord­
ing to Einstein’s second principle) all observers must agree on this speed. 
Giving credit where credit is due
No physicist works in a vacuum, and that was 
certainly true of Albert Einstein. Though he rev­
olutionized the world of physics, he did so by 
resolving the biggest issues of his day, which 
means he was tackling problems that a lot of 
other physicists were also working on. He had 
a lot of useful research to borrow from. Some 
have accused Einstein of plagiarism, or implied 
that his work wasn’t truly revolutionary because 
he borrowed so heavily from the work of others.
For example, his work in special relativity was 
largely based on the work of Hendrik Lorentz, 
George FitzGerald, and Jules Henri Poincaré, 
who had developed mathematical transforma­
tions that Einstein would later use in his theory 
of relativity. Essentially, they did the heavy lift­
ing of creating special relativity, but they fell 
short in one important way — they thought it 
was a mathematical trick, not a true represen­
tation of physical reality.
The same is true of the discovery of the photon. 
Max Planck introduced the idea of energy 
in discrete packets, but thought it was only a 
mathematical trick to resolve a specific odd 
situation. Einstein took the mathematical results 
literally and created the theory of the photon.
The accusations of plagiarism are largely dis­
missed by the scientific community because 
Einstein never denied that the work was done 
by others and, in fact, gave them credit when he 
was aware of their work. Physicists tend to rec­
ognize the revolutionary nature of Einstein’s work 
and know that others contributed greatly to it.

86
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Sometimes, though, different observers disagree on the distance a light beam 
has traveled, depending on how they’re moving through space.
This means that to get the same speed those observers must disagree about 
the time the light beam travels the given distance.
You can picture this for yourself by understanding the thought experiment 
depicted in Figure 6-2. Imagine that you’re on a spaceship and holding a laser 
so it shoots a beam of light directly up, striking a mirror you’ve placed on the 
ceiling. The light beam then comes back down and strikes a detector.

However, the spaceship is traveling at a constant speed of half the speed of 
light (0.5c, as physicists would write it). According to Einstein, this makes no 
difference to you — you can’t even tell that you’re moving. However, if astro­
naut Amber were spying on you, as in the bottom of Figure 6-2, it would be a 
different story.
Amber would see your beam of light travel upward along a diagonal path, 
strike the mirror, and then travel downward along a diagonal path before 
striking the detector. In other words, you and Amber would see different 
paths for the light and, more importantly, those paths aren’t even the same 
length. This means that the time the beam takes to go from the laser to the 
mirror to the detector must also be different for you and Amber so that you 
both agree on the speed of light.

87
 Chapter 6: Revolutionizing Space and Time: Einstein’s Relativity
This phenomenon is known as time dilation, where the time on a ship moving 
very quickly appears to pass slower than on Earth. In Chapter 16, I explain 
some ways that this aspect of relativity can be used to allow time travel. In 
fact, it allows the only form of time travel that scientists know for sure is 
physically possible.
As strange as it seems, this example (and many others) demonstrates that in 
Einstein’s theory of relativity, space and time are intimately linked together. 
If you apply Lorentz transformation equations, they work out so that the 
speed of light is perfectly consistent for both observers.
	
This strange behavior of space and time is only evident when you’re traveling 
close to the speed of light, so no one had ever observed it before. Experiments 
carried out since Einstein’s discovery have confirmed that it’s true — time and 
space are perceived differently, in precisely the way Einstein described, for 
objects moving near the speed of light.
Building the space-time continuum
Einstein’s work had shown the connection between space and time. In 
fact, his theory of special relativity allows the universe to be shown as a 
4-dimensional model — three space dimensions and one time dimension. In 
this model, any object’s path through the universe can be described by its 
worldline through the four dimensions.
Though the concept of space-time is inherent in Einstein’s work, it was 
actually an old professor of his, Hermann Minkowski, who developed the 
concept into a full, elegant mathematical model of space-time coordinates in 
1907. Actually, Minkowski had been specifically unimpressed with Einstein, 
famously calling him a “lazy dog.”
One of the elements of this work is the Minkowski diagram, which shows the 
path of an object through space-time. It shows an object on a graph, where 
one axis is space (all three dimensions are treated as one dimension for sim­
plicity) and the other axis is time. As an object moves through the universe, 
its sequence of positions represents a line or curve on the graph, depend­
ing on how it travels. This path is called the object’s worldline, as shown 
in Figure 6-3. In string theory, the idea of a worldline becomes expanded to 
include the motion of strings, into objects called worldsheets. (See Chapter 16 
for more information. A worldsheet can be seen in Figure 16-1.)
Unifying mass and energy
The most famous work of Einstein’s life also dates from 1905 (a very busy 
year for him), when he applied the ideas of his relativity paper to come up 
with the equation E=mc2 that represents the relationship between mass (m) 
and energy (E).

The reason for this connection is a bit involved, but essentially it relates to 
the concept of kinetic energy discussed in Chapter 5. Einstein found that as 
an object approached the speed of light, c, the mass of the object increased. 
The object goes faster, but it also gets heavier. In fact, if it were actually able 
to move at c, the object’s mass and energy would both be infinite. A heavier 
object is harder to speed up, so it’s impossible to ever actually get the par­
ticle up to a speed of c.
In this 1905 paper — “Does the Inertia of a Body Depend on its Energy 
Content?” — Einstein showed this work and extended it to stationary matter, 
showing that mass at rest contains an amount of energy equal to mass 
times c2.
	
Until Einstein, the concepts of mass and energy were viewed as completely 
separate. He proved that the principles of conservation of mass and conserva­
tion of energy are part of the same larger, unified principle, conservation of 
mass-energy. Matter can be turned into energy and energy can be turned into 
matter because a fundamental connection exists between the two types of 
substance.

World’s Most Famous Equation by David Bodanis (Walker & Company).

 Chapter 6: Revolutionizing Space and Time: Einstein’s Relativity
Changing Course: Introducing 
General Relativity
General relativity was Einstein’s theory of gravity, published in 1915, 
which extended special relativity to take into account non-inertial frames of 
reference — areas that are accelerating with respect to each other. General 
relativity takes the form of field equations, describing the curvature of space-
time and the distribution of matter throughout space-time. The effects of 
matter and space-time on each other are what we perceive as gravity.
Gravity as acceleration
Einstein immediately realized that his theory of special relativity worked 
only when an object moved in a straight line at a constant speed. What about 
when one of the spaceships accelerated or traveled in a curve?
Einstein came to realize the principle that would prove crucial to developing 
his general theory of relativity. He called it the principle of equivalence, and 
it states that an accelerated system is completely physically equivalent to a 
system inside a gravitational field.
As Einstein later related the discovery, he was sitting in a chair thinking 
about the problem when he realized that if someone fell from the roof of a 
house, he wouldn’t feel his own weight. This suddenly gave him an under­
standing of the equivalence principle.
As with most of Einstein’s major insights, he introduced the idea as a thought 
experiment. If a group of scientists were in an accelerating spaceship and 
performed a series of experiments, they would get exactly the same results 
as if sitting still on a planet whose gravity provided that same acceleration, 
as shown in Figure 6-4.
Einstein’s brilliance was that after he realized an idea applied to reality, he 
applied it uniformly to every physics situation he could think of.
For example, if a beam of light entered an accelerating spaceship, then the 
beam would appear to curve slightly, as in the left picture of Figure 6-5. The 
beam is trying to go straight, but the ship is accelerating, so the path, as 
viewed inside the ship, would be a curve.
By the principle of equivalence, this meant that gravity should also bend 
light, as shown in the right picture of Figure 6-5. When Einstein first realized 
this in 1907, he had no way to calculate the effect, other than to predict that 
it would probably be very small. Ultimately, though, this exact effect would 
be the one used to give general relativity its strongest support.

 Chapter 6: Revolutionizing Space and Time: Einstein’s Relativity
Gravity as geometry
The theory of the space-time continuum already existed, but under general 
relativity Einstein was able to describe gravity as the bending of space-time 
geometry. Einstein defined a set of field equations, which represented the way 
that gravity behaved in response to matter in space-time. These field equa­
tions could be used to represent the geometry of space-time that was at the 
heart of the theory of general relativity.
As Einstein developed his general theory of relativity, he had to refine 
Minkowski’s notion of the space-time continuum into a more precise math­
ematical framework (see the earlier “Building the space-time continuum” 
section for more on this concept). He also introduced another principle, the 
principle of covariance. This principle states that the laws of physics must 
take the same form in all coordinate systems.
	
In other words, all space-time coordinates are treated the same by the laws 
of physics — in the form of Einstein’s field equations. This is similar to the 
relativity principle, which states that the laws of physics are the same for 
all observers moving at constant speeds. In fact, after general relativity was 
developed, it was clear that the principles of special relativity were a special 
case.
	
Einstein’s basic principle was that no matter where you are — Toledo, Mount 
Everest, Jupiter, or the Andromeda galaxy — the same laws apply. This time, 
though, the laws were the field equations, and your motion could very defi­
nitely impact what solutions came out of the field equations.
Applying the principle of covariance meant that the space-time coordinates 
in a gravitational field had to work exactly the same way as the space-time 
coordinates on a spaceship that was accelerating. If you’re accelerating 
through empty space (where the space-time field is flat, as in the left picture 
of Figure 6-6), the geometry of space-time would appear to curve. This meant 
that if there’s an object with mass generating a gravitational field, it had to 
curve the space-time field as well (as shown in the right picture of Figure 6-6).

matter,

is flat (left), 
but it curves

92
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
	
In other words, Einstein had succeeded in explaining the Newtonian mystery 
of where gravity came from! Gravity resulted from massive objects bending 
space-time geometry itself.
Because space-time curved, the objects moving through space would follow 
the “straightest” path along the curve, which explains the motion of the plan­
ets. They follow a curved path around the sun because the sun bends space-
time around it.
	
Again, you can think of this by analogy. If you’re flying by plane on Earth, you 
follow a path that curves around the Earth. In fact, if you take a flat map and 
draw a straight line between the start and end points of a trip, that would not 
be the shortest path to follow. The shortest path is actually the one formed 
by a “great circle” that you’d get if you cut the Earth directly in half, with both 
points along the outside of the cut. Traveling from New York City to northern 
Australia involves flying up along southern Canada and Alaska — nowhere 
close to a straight line on the flat maps we’re used to.
Similarly, the planets in the solar system follow the shortest paths — those 
that require the least amount of energy — and that results in the motion we 
observe.
Testing general relativity
For most purposes, the theory of general relativity matched the predictions 
of Newton’s gravity, and it also incorporated special relativity — it was a rela­
tivistic theory of gravity. But no matter how impressive a theory is, it still has 
to be confirmed by experiment before the physics community fully embraces 
it. Today, scientists have seen extensive evidence of general relativity.
One stunning modern example of applying relativity is the global positioning 
system (GPS). The GPS satellite system sends carefully synchronized beams 
around the planet. This is what allows military and commercial devices to 
know their location to within a few meters or better. But the entire system 
is based upon the synchronization of these satellites that had to be pro­
grammed with corrections to take into account the curvature of space-time 
near Earth. Without these corrections, minor timing errors would accumulate 
day after day, causing the system to completely break down.
Of course, such equipment wasn’t available to Einstein when he published 
his theory in 1915, so the theory had to gain support in other ways.
One solution that Einstein immediately arrived at was to explain an anomaly 
in the orbit of Mercury. For years, it had been known that Newtonian grav­
ity wasn’t quite matching up with astronomers’ observations of Mercury’s 
path around the sun. By taking into account the effects of relativity’s curved 

93
 Chapter 6: Revolutionizing Space and Time: Einstein’s Relativity
space-time, Einstein’s solution precisely matched the path observed by 
astronomers.
Still, this wasn’t quite enough to win over all the critics, because another 
theory of gravity had its own appeal.
Pulled in another direction: Einstein’s 
competition for a theory of gravity
A couple of years before Einstein completed his theory of general relativity, 
the Finnish physicist Gunnar Nordström introduced his metric theory of grav­
ity that also combined gravity with special relativity. He went further, taking 
James Clerk Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory and applying an extra space 
dimension, which meant that the electromagnetic force was also included in 
the theory. It was simpler and more comprehensive than Einstein’s general 
relativity, but ultimately wrong (in a way that most physicists then and today 
see as fairly obvious). But this was the first attempt to use an extra dimen­
sion in a unification theory, so it’s worth investigating a bit.
Einstein himself was supportive of Nordström’s work to incorporate special 
relativity with gravity. In a 1913 speech on the state of unifying the two, he 
said that only his work and that of Nordström met the necessary criteria. 
In 1914, though, Nordström introduced a mathematical trick that increased 
the stakes of unification. He took Maxwell’s electromagnetic equations and 
formulated them in four space dimensions, instead of the usual three that 
Einstein had used. The resulting equations included the equation describing 
the force of gravity!
	
Including the dimension of time, this made Nordström’s theory a 
5-dimensional space-time theory of gravity. He treated our universe as 
a 4-dimensional projection of a 5-dimensional space-time. (This is kind of 
similar to how your shadow on a wall is a 2-dimensional projection of your 
3-dimensional body.) By adding an extra dimension to an established physi­
cal theory, Nordström unified electromagnetics and gravity! This provides an 
early example of a principle from string theory — that the addition of extra 
dimensions can provide a mathematical means for unifying and simplifying 
physical laws.
When Einstein published his complete theory of general relativity in 1915, 
Nordström jumped ship on his own theory because Einstein could explain 
Mercury’s orbit while his own theory could not.
Nordström’s theory had a lot going for it, though, because it was much sim­
pler than Einstein’s theory of gravity. In 1917, a year after Nordström himself 
had given up on it, some physicists considered his metric theory a valid alter­
native to general relativity. Nothing noteworthy came out of these scientists’ 
efforts, though, so clearly they had backed the wrong theory.

94
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
The eclipse that confirmed Einstein’s life work
One major difference between Einstein’s and Nordström’s theories was that 
they made different predictions about light’s behavior. Under Nordström’s 
theory, light always traveled in a straight line. According to general relativity, 
a beam of light would curve within a gravitational field.
In fact, as early as the late 1700s, physicists had predicted that light would 
curve under Newtonian gravity. Einstein’s equations showed that these ear­
lier predictions were off by a factor of 2.
The deflection of light predicted by Einstein is due to the curvature of space-time 
around the sun. Because the sun is so massive that it causes space-time to curve, 
a beam of light that travels near the sun will travel along a curved path — the 
“shortest” path along the curved space-time, as shown in Figure 6-7.

In 1911, Einstein had done enough work on general relativity to predict how 
much the light should curve in this situation, which should be visible to 
astronomers during an eclipse.
Astronomers on an expedition to Russia in 1914 attempted to observe the 
deflection of light by the sun, but the team ran into one little snag: World War I. 
Arrested as prisoners of war and released a few weeks later, the astronomers 
missed the eclipse that would have tested Einstein’s theory of gravity.
This turned out to be great news for Einstein, because his 1911 calculations 
contained an error! Had the astronomers been able to view the eclipse in 
1914, the negative results might have caused Einstein to give up his work on 
general relativity.

 Chapter 6: Revolutionizing Space and Time: Einstein’s Relativity
When he published his complete theory of general relativity in 1915, he’d 
corrected the problem, making a slightly modified prediction for how the 
light would be deflected. In 1919, another expedition set out, this time to the 
west African island of Principe. The expedition leader was British astronomer 
Arthur Eddington, a strong supporter of Einstein.
Despite hardships on the expedition, Eddington returned to England with the 
pictures he needed, and his calculations showed that the deflection of light 
precisely matched Einstein’s predictions. General relativity had made a pre­
diction that matched observation.
Albert Einstein had successfully created a theory that explained the gravita­
tional forces of the universe and had done so by applying a handful of basic 
principles. To the degree possible, the work had been confirmed, and most of 
the physics world agreed with it.
Almost overnight, Einstein’s name became world famous. In 1921, Einstein 
traveled through the United States to a media circus that probably wasn’t 
matched until the Beatlemania of the 1960s.
Applying Einstein’s Work to the 
Mysteries of the Universe
Einstein’s work in developing the theory of relativity had shown amazing 
results, unifying key concepts and clarifying important symmetries in the uni­
verse. Still, there are some cases where relativity predicts strange behavior, 
such as singularities, where the curvature of space-time becomes infinite and 
the laws of relativity seem to break down. String theory today continues this 
work by trying to extend the concepts of relativity into these areas, hoping to 
find new rules that work in these regions.
With relativity in place, physicists could look to the heavens and begin 
a study of how the universe evolved over time, a field called cosmology. 
However, Einstein’s field equations also allow for some strange behavior — 
such as black holes and time travel — that has caused great distress to 
Einstein and others over the years.
If you haven’t read about relativity before, this chapter may seem like a whirl­
wind of strange, exotic concepts — and these new theories certainly felt so 
to the physicists of the time. Fundamental concepts — motion, mass, energy, 
space, time, and gravity — were transformed in a period of only 15 years!
Motion, instead of being just some incidental behavior of objects, was now 
crucial to understanding how the laws of physics manifested themselves. 
The laws don’t change — this was key to all of Einstein’s work — but they 

96
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
can manifest in different ways, depending on where you are and how you’re 
moving — or how space-time is moving around you.
In Chapter 9, I cover the ideas of modern cosmology arising from Einstein’s 
work, such as the black holes that can form when massive quantities of 
mass cause space-time to curve infinitely far and similar problems that come 
up when trying to apply relativity to the early universe. Or, as you see in 
Chapter 16, some solutions to Einstein’s equations allow time travel.
Einstein himself was extremely uncomfortable with these unusual solutions 
to his equations. To the best of his ability, he tried to disprove them. When 
he failed, he would sometimes violate his own basic belief in the mathematics 
and claim that these solutions represented physically impossible situations.
Despite the strange implications, Einstein’s theory of general relativity has 
been around for nearly a century and has met every challenge — at least 
when applied to objects larger than a molecule. As I point out in Chapter 2, 
at very small scales quantum effects become important, and the descrip­
tion using general relativity begins to break down. The equations make no 
sense, and space-time becomes an exotic, tumultuous mess of energy fluctua­
tions. The force of gravity explodes to an infinite value. String theory (hope­
fully) represents one way of reconciling gravity at this realm, as I explain in 
Chapters 10 and 11.
Kaluza-Klein Theory — String 
Theory’s Predecessor
One of the earliest attempts to unify gravity and electromagnetic forces came 
in the form of Kaluza-Klein theory, a short-lived theory that again unified the 
forces by introducing an extra space dimension. In this theory, the extra 
space dimension was curled up to a microscopic size. Though it failed, many 
of the same concepts were eventually applied in the study of string theory.
Einstein’s theory had proved so elegant in explaining gravity that physicists 
wanted to apply it to the other force known at the time — the electromagnetic 
force. Was it possible that this other force was also a manifestation of the 
geometry of space-time?
In 1915, even before Einstein completed his general relativity field equations, 
the British mathematician David Hilbert said that research by Nordström and 
others indicated “that gravitation and electrodynamics are not really differ­
ent.” Einstein responded, “I have often tortured my mind in order to bridge 
the gap between gravitation and electromagnetism.”

97
 Chapter 6: Revolutionizing Space and Time: Einstein’s Relativity
One theory in this regard was developed and presented to Einstein in 1919 
by German mathematician Theodor Kaluza. In 1914, Nordström had written 
Maxwell’s equations in five dimensions and had obtained the gravity equa­
tions (see the section “Pulled in another direction: Einstein’s competition for 
a theory of gravity”). Kaluza took the gravitational field equations of general 
relativity and wrote them in five dimensions, obtaining results that included 
Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism!
When Kaluza wrote to Einstein to present the idea, the founder of relativ­
ity replied by saying that increasing the dimensions “never dawned on 
me” (which means he must have been unaware of Nordström’s attempt to 
unify electromagnetism and gravity, even though he was clearly aware of 
Nordström’s theory of gravity).
In Kaluza’s view, the universe was a 5-dimensional cylinder and our 
4-dimensional world was a projection on its surface. Einstein wasn’t quite 
ready to take that leap without any evidence for the extra dimension. Still, he 
incorporated some of Kaluza’s concepts into his own unified field theory that 
he published and almost immediately recanted in 1925.
A year later, in 1926, Swedish physicist Oskar Klein dusted off Kaluza’s theory 
and reworked it into the form that has come to be known as the Kaluza-Klein 
theory. Klein introduced the idea that the fourth space dimension was rolled 
up into a tiny circle, so small that there was essentially no way for us to 
detect it directly.
In Kaluza-Klein theory, the geometry of this extra, hidden space dimension 
dictated the properties of the electromagnetic force — the size of the circle, 
and a particle’s motion in that extra dimension, related to the electrical 
charge of a particle. The physics fell apart on this level because the predic­
tions of an electron’s charge and mass never worked out to match the true 
value. Also, many physicists initially intrigued with the Kaluza-Klein theory 
became far more intrigued with the growing field of quantum mechanics, 
which had actual experimental evidence (as you see in Chapter 7).
Another problem with the theory is that it predicted a particle with zero 
mass, zero spin, and zero charge. Not only was this particle never observed 
(despite the fact that it should have been, because it’s a low-energy particle), 
but the particle corresponded to the radius of the extra dimensions. It didn’t 
make sense to add a theory with extra dimensions and then have a result be 
that the extra dimensions effectively didn’t exist.
There is another (though less conventional) way to describe the failure of 
Kaluza-Klein theory, viewing it as a fundamental theoretical limitation: For 
electromagnetism to work, the extra dimension’s geometry had to be com­
pletely fixed.

98
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
	
In this view, tacking an extra dimension onto a theory of dynamic space 
should result in a theory that is still dynamic. Having a fifth dimension that’s 
fixed (while the other four dimensions are flexible) just doesn’t make sense 
from this point of view. This concept, called background dependence, returns 
as a serious criticism of string theory in Chapter 17.
Whatever the ultimate reason for its failure, Kaluza-Klein theory lasted for 
only a short time, although there are indications that Einstein continued to 
tinker with it off and on until the early 1940s, incorporating elements into his 
various failed unified field theory attempts.
In the 1970s, as physicists began to realize that string theory contained extra 
dimensions, the original Kaluza-Klein theory served as an example from the 
past. Physicists once again curled up the extra dimensions, as Klein had 
done, so they were essentially undetectable (I explain this in more detail in 
Chapter 10). Such theories are called Kaluza-Klein theories.

A
s strange as relativity may have seemed to you (see Chapter 6), it’s a 
cakewalk compared to understanding quantum physics. In this strange 
realm of physics — the realm of the extremely small — particles don’t have 
definite positions or energies. They can exist not only as particles, but also 
as waves, but only when you don’t look at them. One hope scientists have is 
that string theory will explain some of the unusual results in quantum physics 
or, at the least, reconcile it with general relativity. Particle physics, on the 
other hand, is at the heart of string theory’s origins and is a direct consequence 
of this early work in quantum physics (see Chapter 8). Without quantum 
physics, string theory could not exist.
As in the other chapters in this part, the goal of this chapter is not to provide a 
complete overview of all of quantum physics — there are other books that do 
a fine job of that, including Quantum Physics For Dummies by Steven Holzner 
(Wiley). My goal here is to give you the background you need to know about 
quantum physics so you can understand certain aspects of string theory. 
It may not seem that these ideas relate directly to string theory, but being 
familiar with these concepts will be handy down the road when I explain 
string theory itself.

Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
In this chapter, I give you a brief introduction to the history and principles 
of quantum physics, just enough so you can understand the later concepts 
related to string theory. I explain how quantum theory allows objects to act 
as both particles and waves. You explore the implications of the uncertainty 
principle and probability in quantum physics (dead cat not required). I list 
some of the many interpretations of what all of these strange quantum rules 
may actually mean — though no one really knows (or can know) for sure. 
Finally, I discuss the idea that special natural units can be used to describe 
reality.
Unlocking the First Quanta: The 
Birth of Quantum Physics
Quantum physics traces its roots back to 1900, when German physicist 
Max Planck proposed a solution to a thermodynamics problem — a problem 
having to do with heat. He resolved the problem by introducing a mathematical 
trick — if he assumed that energy was bundled in discrete packets, or quanta, 
the problem went away. (It proved to be brilliant because it worked. There 
was no theoretical reason for doing this, until Einstein came up with one five 
years later, as discussed in the next section.) In the process of doing this, 
Planck used a quantity known as Planck’s constant, which has proved essential 
to quantum physics — and string theory.
Planck used this quantum concept — the concept that many physical 
quantities come in discrete units — to solve a problem in physics, but even 
Planck himself assumed that this was just a clever mathematical process to 
remove the infinity. It would take five years for Albert Einstein to continue 
the quantum revolution in physics.
The blackbody radiation problem, which Planck was trying to solve, is a 
basic thermodynamics problem where you have an object that is so hot that 
it glows inside. A small hole allows the light to escape, and it can be studied. 
The problem is that in the 1800s, experiments and theories in this area didn’t 
match up.
A hot object radiates heat in the form of light (hot coals in a fire or the metal 
rings on electric stoves are both good examples of this). If this object were 
open inside, like an oven or a metal box, the heat would bounce around 
inside. This sort of object was called a blackbody — because the object itself 
doesn’t reflect light, only radiates heat — and throughout the 1800s, various 
theoretical work in thermodynamics had examined the way heat behaved 
inside a blackbody.

101
 Chapter 7: Brushing Up on Quantum Theory Basics
Now assume that there’s a small opening — like a window — in the oven, 
through which light can escape. Studying this light reveals information about 
the heat energy within the blackbody.
Essentially, the heat inside a blackbody took the form of electromagnetic 
waves, and because the oven is metal, they’re standing waves, with nodes 
where they meet the side of the oven (see Chapter 5 for details about 
waves). This fact — along with an understanding of electromagnetics and 
thermodynamics — can be used to calculate the relationship between light’s 
intensity (or brightness) and wavelength.
	
The result is that as the wavelength of light gets very small (the ultraviolet 
range of electromagnetic energy), the intensity is supposed to increase 
dramatically, approaching infinity.
In nature, scientists never actually observe infinities, and this was no 
exception (see Chapter 2 for more about infinities). The research showed 
that there were maximum intensities in the ultraviolet range, which completely 
contradicted the theoretical expectations, as shown in Figure 7-1. This 
discrepancy came to be known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.

The ultraviolet catastrophe threatened to undermine the theories of 
electromagnetics and/or thermodynamics. Clearly, if they didn’t match 
experiment, then one or both of the theories contained errors.

102
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
When Planck resolved the ultraviolet catastrophe in 1900, he did so by 
introducing the idea that the atom could only absorb or emit light in quanta 
(or discrete bundles of energy). One implication of this radical assumption 
was that there would be less radiation emitted at higher energies. By 
introducing the idea of discrete energy packets — by quantizing energy — 
Planck produced a solution that resolved the situation without having to 
dramatically revise the existing theories (at least at that time).
Planck’s insight came when he looked at the data and tried to figure out 
what was going on. Clearly, the long wavelength predictions were close 
to matching with experiment, but the short wavelength light was not. The 
theory was over-predicting the amount of light that would be produced at 
short wavelengths, so he needed a way to limit this short wavelength.
Knowing some things about waves, Planck knew that the wavelength and 
frequency were inversely related. So if you’re talking about waves with short 
wavelength, you’re also talking about waves with high frequency. All he had 
to do was find a way to lower the amount of radiation at high frequencies.
Planck reworked the equations, assuming that the atoms could only emit or 
absorb energy in finite quantities. The energy and frequency were related 
by a proportion called Planck’s constant. Physicists use the variable h to 
represent Planck’s constant in his resulting physics equations.
The resulting equation worked to explain the experimental results of 
blackbody radiation. Planck, and apparently everyone else, thought this was 
just a mathematical sleight of hand that had resolved the problem in one 
strange, special case. Little did anyone realize that Planck had just laid the 
foundation for the strangest scientific discoveries in the history of the world.
Fun with Photons: Einstein’s 
Nobel Idea of Light
Einstein received the Nobel Prize not for relativity, but instead for his work 
in using Planck’s idea of the quantum to explain another problem — the 
photoelectric effect. He went further than Planck, suggesting that all 
electromagnetic energy was quantized. Light, Einstein said, moved not in 
waves, but in packets of energy. These packets of energy became called 
photons. Photons are one of the fundamental particles of physics that 
physicists hope to explain using string theory.

103
 Chapter 7: Brushing Up on Quantum Theory Basics
The photoelectric effect occurs when light shines on certain materials that 
then emit electrons. It’s almost as if the light knocks loose the electrons, 
causing them to fly off the material. The photoelectric effect was first 
observed in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz, but it continued to puzzle physicists 
until Einstein’s 1905 explanation.
At first, the photoelectric effect didn’t seem that hard to explain. The 
electrons absorbed the light’s energy, which caused the electrons to fly 
off the metal plate. Physicists still knew very little about electrons — and 
virtually nothing about the atom — but this made sense.
As expected, if you increased the light’s intensity (the total energy per second 
carried by the beam), more electrons definitely were emitted (see the top of 
Figure 7-2). There were two unexpected problems though:
	
✓	Above a certain wavelength, no electrons are emitted — no matter how 
intense the light is (as shown in the bottom of Figure 7-2).
	
✓	When you increase the light’s intensity, the speed of the electrons 
doesn’t change.
Einstein saw a connection between this first problem and the ultraviolet 
catastrophe faced by Max Planck (see the preceding section for more about 
Planck’s work), but in the opposite direction. The longer wavelength light (or 
light with lower frequency) failed to do things that were being achieved by 
the shorter wavelength light (light with higher frequency).
Planck had created a proportional relationship between energy and frequency. 
Einstein again did what he was best at — he took the mathematics at face 
value and applied it consistently. The result was that the high frequency light 
had higher energy photons, so it was able to transfer enough energy into the 
electron for it to get knocked loose. The lower frequency photons didn’t have 
enough energy to help any electrons escape. The photons had to have energy 
above a certain threshold to knock the electrons loose.
Powered by the photoelectric effect
Modern solar cells work off the same principle 
as the photoelectric effect. Composed of photo-
electric materials, they take electromagnetic 
radiation in the form of sunlight and convert it 
into free electrons. Those free electrons then 
run through wires to create an electric current 
that can power devices such as ornamental 
lights in your flowerbed or NASA’s Martian 
rovers.

Similarly, the second problem of the noneffect of light’s intensity on an 
electron’s speed is also solved by Einstein’s quantum view of light. Each 
photon’s energy is based on its frequency (or wavelength), so increasing 
the intensity doesn’t change the energy of each photon; it only increases the 
total number of photons. This is why increasing the intensity causes more 
electrons to get emitted, but each electron maintains the same speed. The 
individual photon knocks out an electron with the same energy as before, but 
more photons are doing the same job. No single electron gets the benefit of 
the increase in intensity.
	
Based on the principle that the speed of light was constant (the basis of his 
special theory of relativity), Einstein knew that these photons would always 
move at the same velocity, c. Their energy would be proportional to the 
frequency of the light, based on Planck’s definitions.

105
 Chapter 7: Brushing Up on Quantum Theory Basics
Waves and Particles Living Together
Within quantum physics, two alternate explanations of light work, depending on 
the circumstances. Sometimes light acts like a wave, and sometimes it acts 
like a particle, the photon. As quantum physics continued to grow, this wave 
particle duality would come up again and again, as even particles seemed to 
begin acting like waves. The explanation for this strange behavior lies in the 
quantum wavefunction, which describes the behavior of individual particles 
in a wave-like way. This strange quantum behavior of particles and waves is 
crucial to understanding quantum theories, such as string theory.
Einstein’s theory of special relativity had seemingly destroyed the theory 
of an ether medium, and with his theory of the photon he proved how light 
could work without it. The problem was that for more than a century, there 
had been proof that light did, indeed, act like a wave.
Light as a wave: The double 
slit experiment
The experiment that proved that light acts like a wave was the double slit 
experiment. It showed a beam of light passing through two slits in a barrier, 
resulting in light and dark interference bands on a screen. This sort of 
interference is a hallmark of wave behavior, meaning that light had to be in 
the form of waves.
These interference patterns in light had been observed in Isaac Newton’s 
time, in the work of Francesco Maria Grimaldi. These experiments were 
vastly improved upon by the young experimenter Thomas Young in 1802.
For the experiment to work, the light passing through the two slits needed to 
have the same wavelength. Today, you can accomplish this with lasers, but 
they weren’t available in Young’s day, so he came up with an ingenious way 
to get a single wavelength. He created a single slit and let light pass through 
that, and then that light went through two slits. Because the light passing 
through the two slits came from the same source, they were in phase with 
each other, and the experiment worked. This experimental setup is shown in 
Figure 7-3.

106
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
	
Figure 7-3: 
In the 
double slit 
experiment, 
light creates 
bright and 
dark bands 
on a screen.
	
As you can see in the figure, the end result is a series of bright and dark 
bands on the final screen. This comes from the interference of the light 
waves, shown back in Figure 5-2 in Chapter 5. Recall that interference means 
you add the amplitude of the waves. Where high and low amplitudes overlap, 
they cancel each other out, resulting in dark bands. If high amplitudes 
overlap, the amplitude of the total wave is the sum of them, and the same 
happens with low amplitudes, resulting in the light bands.
This dual behavior was the problem facing Einstein’s photon theory of 
light, because though the photon had a wavelength, according to Einstein, 
it was still a particle! How could a particle possibly have a wavelength? 
Conceptually, it made no real sense, until a young Frenchman offered a 
resolution to the situation.
Particles as a wave: The de Broglie 
hypothesis
In 1923, Frenchman Louis de Broglie proposed a bold new theory: Particles of 
matter also had wavelengths and could behave as waves, just as photons did.
Here was de Broglie’s line of reasoning. Under special relativity, matter and 
energy were different manifestations of the same thing. The photon, a particle 
of energy, had a wavelength associated with it. Therefore, particles of matter, 
such as electrons, should also have wavelengths. His PhD dissertation set out 
to calculate what that wavelength (and other wave properties) should be.
Two years later, two American physicists demonstrated de Broglie’s experiment 
by performing experiments that showed interference patterns with electrons, 
as shown in Figure 7-4. (The 1925 experiment wasn’t actually a double slit 
experiment, but it showed the interference clearly. The double slit experiment 
with electrons was conducted in 1961.)

This behavior showed that whatever quantum law governed photons also 
governed particles. The wavelength of particles such as the electron is very 
small compared to the photon. For larger objects, the wavelength is even 
smaller still, quickly becoming so small as to become unnoticeable. This is 
why this sort of behavior doesn’t show up for larger objects. If you flung 
baseballs through the two slits, you’d never notice an interference pattern.
Still, this left open the question of what was causing the wave behavior in 
these particles of energy or matter. The answer would be at the core of the 
new field of quantum mechanics. (String theory will later say that both types 
of particles — matter and energy — are manifestations of vibrating strings, 
but that’s about 50 years down the road from de Broglie’s time.)
You can picture the problem if you look at the way the experiment is set up 
in Figure 7-5. The light wave passes through both slits, and that’s why the 
waves interfere with each other. But an electron — or a photon, for that 
matter — cannot pass through both slits at the same time if you think of them 
the way we’re used to thinking of them; it has to pick a slit. In this classical 
case (where the photon is a solid object that has a certain position), there 
shouldn’t be any interference. The beam of electrons should hit the screen 
in one general spot, just as if you were throwing baseballs through a hole 
against a wall. (This is why quantum physics challenges our classical thinking 
about objects and was deemed so controversial in its early years.)
In fact, if you close one of the slits, this is exactly what happens. When a slit 
is closed, the interference pattern goes away — the photons or electrons col­
lect in a single band that spreads out from the brightest spot at the center.
So the interference patterns can’t be explained by particles bouncing off the 
side of the slits or anything normal like that. It’s a genuinely strange behavior 
that required a genuinely strange solution — in the form of quantum mechanics.

Quantum physics to the rescue: 
The quantum wavefunction
The solution to the problem took the form of the quantum wavefunction, 
developed by Erwin Schrödinger. In this function, the location of the particle 
is dictated by a wave equation describing the probability of the particle’s 
existence at a given point, even though the particle has a definite location 
when measured.
Schrödinger’s wavefunction was based in part on his reading of de Broglie’s 
hypothesis about matter having a wavelength. He used this behavior to 
analyze atomic models created by Niels Bohr (which I cover in Chapter 8). 
The resulting wavefunction explained the behavior of these atoms in terms 
of waves. (Bohr’s student, Werner Heisenberg, had come up with a different 
mathematical representation to solve the atomic problem. Heisenberg’s 
matrix method was later shown to be mathematically equivalent to 
Schrödinger’s wavefunction. This sort of parallel work comes up often in 
physics, as you’ll see in Chapters 10 and 11 about the development of string 
theory.)
	
The wavefunction created the wave behavior. In this viewpoint, the wave 
passed through both slits, even though no single, classical individual particle 
could pass through both slits. The wavefunction, which describes the 
probability of the particle arriving at a point, can be thought of as passing 
through both slits and creating the interference pattern. This is an interference 
pattern of probabilities, even though the particles themselves end up having a 
definite location (and therefore must pass through one slit).

109
 Chapter 7: Brushing Up on Quantum Theory Basics
Still, this isn’t the end of the odd story of the double slit experiment. The 
strange dual behavior — wave and particle — was still there. But now a 
mathematical framework existed that allowed physicists to talk about the 
duality in a manner that made some sort of mathematical sense. The theory 
still held many more mysteries to be uncovered.
Why We Can’t Measure It All:
The Uncertainty Principle
Werner Heisenberg is best known in quantum physics for his discovery of 
the uncertainty principle, which states that the more precisely you measure 
one quantity, the less precisely you can know another associated quantity. 
The quantities sometimes come in set pairs that can’t both be completely 
measured. One consequence of this is that to make measurements of very 
short distances — such as those required by string theory — very high 
energies are required.
What Heisenberg found was that the observation of a system in quantum 
mechanics disturbs the system enough that you can’t know everything about 
the system. The more precisely you measure the position of a particle, for 
example, the less it’s possible to precisely measure the particle’s momentum. 
The degree of this uncertainty was related directly to Planck’s constant — 
the same value that Max Planck had calculated in 1900 in his original quantum 
calculations of thermal energy. (You’ll shortly see that Planck’s constant has 
a lot of unusual implications.)
Heisenberg found that certain complementary quantities in quantum physics 
were linked by this sort of uncertainty:
	
✓	Position and momentum (momentum is mass times velocity)
	
✓	Energy and time
This uncertainty is a very odd and unexpected result from quantum 
physics. Until this time, no one had ever made any sort of prediction that 
knowledge was somehow inaccessible on a fundamental level. Sure, there 
were technological limitations to how well a measurement was made, but 
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle went further, saying that nature itself 
doesn’t allow you to make measurements of both quantities beyond a certain 
level of precision.

110
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
	
One way to think about this is to imagine that you’re trying to observe a 
particle’s position very precisely. To do so, you have to look at the particle. 
But you want to be very precise, which means you need to use a photon with 
a very short wavelength, and a short wavelength relates to a high energy. If 
the photon with high energy hits the particle — which is exactly what you 
need to have happen if you want to observe the particle’s position precisely — 
then it’s going to give some of its energy to the particle. This means that any 
measurement you also try to make of the particle’s momentum will be off. The 
more precisely you try to measure the position, the more you throw off your 
momentum measurement!
Similar explanations work if you observe the particle’s momentum precisely, 
so you throw off the position measurement. The relationship of energy and 
time has a similar uncertainty. These are mathematical results that come 
directly out of analyzing the wavefunction and the equations de Broglie used 
to describe his waves of matter.
How does this uncertainty manifest in the real world? For that, let me return 
to your favorite quantum experiment — the double slit. The double slit 
experiment has continued to grow odder over the years, yielding stranger 
and stranger results. For example:
	
✓	If you send the photons (or electrons) through the slits one at a time, 
the interference pattern shows up over time (recorded on a film), even 
though each photon (or electron) has seemingly nothing to interfere with.
	
✓	If you set up a detector near either (or both) slits to detect which slit the 
photon (or electron) went through, the interference pattern goes away.
	
✓	If you set up the detector but leave it turned off, the interference pattern 
comes back.
	
✓	If you set up a means of determining later what slit the photon (or 
electron) went through, but do nothing to impact it right now, the 
interference pattern goes away.
	
What does all of this have to do with the uncertainty principle? The common 
denominator among the cases where the interference pattern goes away is 
that a measurement was made on which slit the photons (or electrons) passed 
through.
When no slit measurement is made, the uncertainty in position remains high, 
and the wave behavior appears dominant. As soon as a measurement is 
made, the uncertainty in position drops significantly and the wave behavior 
vanishes. (There is also a case where you observe some of the photons or 
electrons. Predictably, in this case, you get both behaviors, in exact ratio to 
how many particles you’re measuring.)

Dead Cats, Live Cats, and Probability 
in Quantum Physics
In the traditional interpretation of quantum physics, the wavefunction is seen 
as a representation of the probability that a particle will be in a given location. 
After a measurement is made, the wavefunction collapses, giving the particle 
a definite value for the measured quantity.
In the double slit experiments, the wavefunction splits between the two 
slits, and this wavefunction results in an interference of probabilities on the 
screen. When the measurements are made on the screen, the probabilities 
are distributed so that it’s more likely to find particles in some places and 
less likely to find them in other places, resulting in the light and dark 
interference bands. The particle never splits, but the probability of where the 
particle will be does split. Until the measurement is made, the distribution of 
probabilities is all that exists.
This interpretation was developed by the physicist Max Born and grew to be 
the core of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics (which I 
explain toward the end of this chapter). For this explanation, Born received 
(three decades later) the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Almost as soon as the explanation of probabilities was proposed, Erwin 
Schrödinger came up with a morbid thought experiment intended to show 
how absurd it was. It’s become one of the most important, and misunderstood, 
concepts in all of physics: the Schrödinger’s cat experiment.
In this experiment, Schrödinger hypothesized a radioactive particle that has 
a 50 percent chance of decaying within an hour. He proposed that you place 
the radioactive material within a closed box next to a Geiger counter that 
would detect the radiation. When the Geiger counter detects the radiation 
from the decay, it will break a glass of poison gas. Also inside the box is a cat. 
If the glass breaks, the cat dies. (I told you it was morbid.)
Now, according to Born’s interpretation of the wavefunction, after an hour 
the atom is in a quantum state where it is both decayed and not decayed — 
50 percent chance of each result. This means the Geiger counter is in a state 
where it’s both triggered and not triggered. The glass containing the poison 
gas is both broken and not broken. The cat is both dead and alive!
This may sound absurd, but it’s the logical extension of the particle being 
both decayed and not decayed. Schrödinger believed that quantum physics 
couldn’t describe such an insane world, but that the cat had to be either 
completely alive or completely dead even before the box is opened and 
observed.

112
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
After you open the box, according to this interpretation, the cat’s state 
becomes well defined one way or the other, but in the absence of a 
measurement, it’s in both states. Though Schrödinger’s cat experiment was 
created to oppose this interpretation of quantum mechanics, it has become 
the most dramatic example used to illustrate the strange quantum nature of 
reality.
Does Anyone Know What Quantum 
Theory Means?
Quantum physics is based on experimental evidence, much of which was 
obtained in the first half of the 20th century. The odd behavior has been 
seen in laboratories around the world, continually agreeing with the theory, 
despite all common sense. The really strange behavior occurs only on small 
scales; when you get to the size of cats, the quantum phenomena seems to 
always take on a definite value. Still, even today, the exact meaning of this 
strange quantum behavior is up in the air — something that doesn’t trouble 
most modern physicists who work on these problems.
Some physicists hope that a “theory of everything,” perhaps even string 
theory, may provide clear explanations for the underlying physical meaning 
of quantum physics. Among them, Lee Smolin has cited string theory’s failure 
to explain quantum physics as a reason to look elsewhere for a fundamental 
theory of the universe — a view that is certainly not maintained by the 
majority of string theorists. Most string theorists believe that what matters 
is that quantum physics works (that is, it makes predictions that match 
experiment) and the philosophical concerns of why it works are less 
important. All of the interpretations of why quantum physics work yield the 
same experimental predictions, so they are effectively equivalent.
Einstein spent the last 30 years of his life railing against the scientific and 
philosophical implications of quantum physics. This was a lively time of 
debate in physics, as he and Niels Bohr sparred back and forth. “God does 
not play dice with the universe,” Einstein was quoted as saying. Bohr replied, 
“Einstein, stop telling God what to do!”
	
A similar era may be upon us now, as theoretical physicists attempt to 
uncover the fundamental principles that guide string theory. Unlike quantum 
theory, there are few (if any) experimental results to base new work on, but 
there are many Einsteinian critics — again, on both scientific and philosophical 
grounds. (We get to them in Part V.)
Even with a firm theory that clearly works, physicists continue to question 
what quantum physics really means. What is the physical reality behind the 
mathematical equations? What actually happens to Schrödinger’s cat? Some 

113
 Chapter 7: Brushing Up on Quantum Theory Basics
physicists hope that string theory may provide an answer to this question, 
though this is far from the dominant view. Still, any successful attempt to 
extend quantum physics into a new realm could provide unexpected insights 
that may resolve the questions.
Interactions transform quantum systems: 
The Copenhagen interpretation
The Copenhagen interpretation represents the orthodox view of quantum 
physics as it’s taught in most undergraduate level courses, and it’s mostly 
how I’ve interpreted quantum physics in this chapter: An observation or 
measurement causes the wavefunction to collapse from a general state of 
probabilities to a specific state.
The name comes from the Copenhagen Institute in (you guessed it) 
Copenhagen, Denmark, where Niels Bohr and his students helped form 
quantum physics in the 1920s and early 1930s, before World War II caused 
many to leave the Netherlands as they picked sides.
In today’s talk, most physicists view the particles in the wavefunction as 
continually interacting with the world around them. These interactions are 
enough to cause the wavefunction to go through a process called decoherence, 
which basically makes the wavefunction collapse into a definite value. In 
other words, the very act of interacting with other matter causes a quantum 
system to become a classical system. Only by carefully isolating the quantum 
system to avoid such interactions will it remain in a coherent state, staying 
as a wave long enough to exhibit exotic quantum behaviors such as interference.
Under this explanation, you don’t have to open the box for Schrödinger’s cat 
to take on a definite state. The Geiger counter is probably where the breakdown 
occurs, and reality makes a “choice” of whether the particle has or has not 
decayed. Decoherence of the wavefunction takes place well before it ever 
reaches the cat.
If no one’s there to see it, does the universe 
exist? The participatory anthropic principle
The participatory anthropic principle (PAP) was proposed by the physicist 
John Archibald Wheeler when he said that people exist in a “participatory 
universe.” In Wheeler’s (extremely controversial) view, an actual observer 
is needed to cause the collapse of the wavefunction, not just bits and pieces 
bouncing into each other.

114
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
This stance goes significantly further than the strict tenets of the 
Copenhagen interpretation, but it can’t be completely dismissed when you 
look in depth at the quantum evidence. If you never look at the quantum 
system, then for all intents and purposes it always stays a quantum system. 
Schrödinger’s cat really is both alive and dead until a person looks inside 
the box.
To John Barrow and Frank Tipler (in their popular and widely controversial 
1986 book The Anthropic Cosmological Principle), this means that the universe 
itself comes into being only if someone is there to observe it. Essentially, the 
universe requires some form of life present for the wavefunction to collapse 
in the first place, meaning that the universe itself could not exist without life 
in it.
Most physicists believe that the PAP approach places humans in a crucial 
role in the universe, a stance which went out of favor when Copernicus 
realized Earth wasn’t the center of the universe. As such, they (rightly, I 
believe) dismiss this interpretation in favor of those where humans aren’t 
necessary components of the universe.
This is an especially strong statement of a concept known as the anthropic 
principle. Recent discoveries in string theory have caused some theoretical 
physicists who were once strongly opposed to any form of anthropic principle 
to begin to adopt weaker versions of the anthropic principle as the only 
means of making predictions from the vast array of string theory possibilities. I 
explain more about this concept in Chapter 11.
All possibilities take place: The many 
worlds interpretation
In contrast, the many worlds interpretation (MWI) of Hugh Everett III proposes 
that the wavefunction never actually collapses, but all possibilities become 
actualities — just in alternate realities. The universe is continually splitting 
apart as every quantum question is resolved in every possible way across an 
immense multiverse of parallel universes.
This is one of the most unusual concepts to come out of quantum physics, 
but it has its own merit. Like the work of Einstein described in Chapter 6, 
Everett arrived at this theory in part by taking the mathematics of quantum 
theory and assuming it could be taken literally. If the equation shows that 
there are two possibilities, then why not assume that there are two possibilities?

115
 Chapter 7: Brushing Up on Quantum Theory Basics
When you look inside the box, instead of something odd happening to the 
quantum system, you actually become part of the quantum system. You now 
exist in two states — one state that has found a dead cat and one state that 
has found a living cat.
	
Though these parallel universes sound like the stuff of science fiction, a related 
concept of parallel universes may arise as a prediction of string theory. In 
fact, it’s possible that there are a vast number of parallel universes — a vast 
multiverse. More on this in Chapter 15.
What are the odds? Consistent histories
In the consistent histories view, the many worlds aren’t actually realized, 
but the probability of them can be calculated. It eliminates the need for 
observers by assuming that the infinite complexity of the universe can’t be 
fully dealt with, even mathematically, so it averages out over a large number 
of possible histories to arrive at the probabilities of the ones that are more 
probable, including the one universe that contains the outcome actually 
witnessed — our own.
Strictly speaking, the consistent history interpretation doesn’t exclude the 
multiple worlds interpretation, but it only focuses on the one outcome you’re 
sure of, rather than the infinite outcomes that you can only conjecture.
From a physical standpoint, this is similar to the idea of decoherence. The 
wavefunctions continually interact with particles just enough to keep all the 
possibilities from being realized. After you analyze all the possible paths, 
many of them cancel out, leaving only a couple of possible histories — the 
cat is either alive or dead. Making the measurement determines which one is 
the real history and which one was only a possibility.
Searching for more fundamental data: 
The hidden variables interpretation
One final interpretation is the hidden variables interpretation, where the 
equations of quantum theory are hiding another level of physical reality. 
The strange probabilities of quantum physics (under this explanation) are 
the result of our ignorance. If you understood this hidden layer, the system 
would be fully deterministic. (In other words, if you knew all the variables, 
you’d know exactly what was going to happen, and the quantum probabilities 
would go away.)

116
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
The first hidden variables theory was developed in the 1920s by Louis de 
Broglie, but a 1932 proof by John von Neumann showed that such theories 
couldn’t exist in quantum physics. In 1952, physicist David Bohm used a 
mistake in this proof and reworked de Broglie’s theory into his own variant 
(which has become the most popular version).
	
The core of Bohm’s argument was a mathematical counterexample to the 
uncertainty principle, showing that quantum theory could be consistent with 
the existence of particles that had definite position and velocity. He assumed 
that these particles reproduced (on average) the results of the Schrödinger 
wavefunction. He was then able to construct a quantum potential wave that 
could guide the particles to behave in this way.
	
In Bohm’s hidden variables theory, there is another hidden layer of physical 
law that is more fundamental than quantum mechanics. The quantum 
randomness would be eliminated if this additional layer could be understood. 
If such a hidden layer exists, it should, in principle, be possible for physics to 
someday reveal it in some way — perhaps through a “theory of everything.” 
(Of course, the existence of either a “hidden layer” or “theory of everything” 
are ideas that aren’t believed by most physicists today.)
Quantum Units of Nature — Planck Units
Physicists occasionally use a system of natural units, called Planck units, 
which are calculated based on fundamental constants of nature like Planck’s 
constant, the gravitational constant, and the speed of light.
Planck’s constant comes up often in discussing quantum physics. In fact, if 
you were to perform the mathematics of quantum physics, you’d find that 
little h variable all over the place. Physicists have even found that you can 
define a set of quantities in terms of Planck’s constant and other fundamental 
constants, such as the speed of light, the gravitational constant, and the 
charge of an electron.
These Planck units come in a variety of forms. There is a Planck charge and 
a Planck temperature, and you can use various Planck units to derive other 
units such as the Planck momentum, Planck pressure, and Planck force . . . 
well, you get the idea.
	
For the purposes of the discussion of string theory, only a few Planck units are 
relevant. They are created by combining the gravitational constant, the speed 
of light, and Planck’s constant, which makes them the natural units to use 
when talking about phenomena that involve those three constants, such as 
quantum gravity. The exact values aren’t important, but here are the general 
scales of the relevant Planck units:

117
 Chapter 7: Brushing Up on Quantum Theory Basics
	
✓	Planck length: 10–35 meters (if a hydrogen atom were as big as our 
galaxy, the Planck length would be the size of a human hair)
	
✓	Planck time: 10–43 seconds (the time light takes to travel the Planck 
length — a very, very short period of time)
	
✓	Planck mass: 10–8 kilograms (about the same as a large bacteria or very 
small insect)
	
✓	Planck energy: 1028 electronvolts (roughly equivalent to a ton of TNT 
explosive)
	
Keep in mind that the exponents represent the number of zeroes, so the 
Planck energy is a 1 followed by 28 zeroes, in electronvolts. The most 
powerful particle accelerator on Earth, the Large Hadron Collider that came 
online briefly in 2008 can produce energy only in the realm of TeV — that is, a 
1 followed by 12 zeroes, in electronvolts.
The negative exponents, in turn, represent the number of decimal places in 
very small numbers, so the Planck time has 42 zeroes between the decimal 
point and the first non-zero digit. It’s a very small amount of time!
Some of these units were first proposed in 1899 by Max Planck himself, 
before either relativity or quantum physics. Such proposals for natural units — 
units based on fundamental constants of nature — had been made at least 
as far back as 1881. Planck’s constant makes its first appearance in the 
physicist’s 1899 paper. The constant would later show up in his paper on the 
quantum solution to the ultraviolet catastrophe.
Planck units can be calculated in relation to each other. For example, it 
takes exactly the Planck time for light to travel the Planck length. The 
Planck energy is calculated by taking the Planck mass and applying Einstein’s 
E = mc2 (meaning that the Planck mass and Planck energy are basically two 
ways of writing the same value).
In quantum physics and cosmology, these Planck units sneak up all the time. 
Planck mass represents the amount of mass needed to be crammed into the 
Planck length to create a black hole. A field in quantum gravity theory would 
be expected to have a vacuum energy with a density roughly equal to one 
Planck energy per cubic Planck length — in other words, it’s 1 Planck unit of 
energy density.
Why are these quantities so important to string theory?
	
The Planck length represents the distance where the smoothness of relativity’s 
space-time and the quantum nature of reality begin to rub up against each 
other. This is the quantum foam I explain in Chapter 2. It’s the distance where 
the two theories each, in their own way, fall apart. Gravity explodes to become 
incredibly powerful, while quantum fluctuations and vacuum energy run 
rampant. This is the realm where a theory of quantum gravity, such as string 
theory, is needed to explain what’s going on.

118
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
In some sense, these units are sometimes considered to be quantum quantities 
of time and space, and perhaps some of the other quantities as well. Mass 
and energy clearly come in smaller scales, but time and distance don’t seem 
to get much smaller than the Planck time and Planck length. Quantum 
fluctuations, due to the uncertainty principle, become so great that it 
becomes meaningless to even talk about something smaller. (See the 
nearby sidebar “Planck units and Zeno’s paradox.”)
	
In most string theories, the length of the strings (or length of compactified 
extra space dimensions) are calculated to be roughly the size of the Planck 
length. The problem with this is that the Planck length and the Planck energy 
are connected through the uncertainty principle, which means that to explore 
the Planck length — the possible length of a string in string theory — with 
precision, you’d introduce an uncertainty in energy equal to the Planck energy.
This is an energy 16 orders of magnitude (add 16 zeroes!) more powerful than 
the newest, most powerful particle accelerator on Earth can reach. Exploring 
such small distances requires a vast amount of energy, far more energy than 
we can produce with present technology.
Planck units and Zeno’s paradox
If the Planck length represents the shortest 
distance allowed in nature, it could be used to 
solve the ancient Greek puzzle called Zeno’s 
paradox. Here is the paradox:
You want to cross a river, so you get in your 
boat. To reach the other side, you must cross 
half the river. Then you must cross half of 
what’s left. Now cross half of what’s left. No 
matter how close you get to the other side of 
the river, you will always have to cover half 
that distance, so it will take you forever to get 
across the river, because you have to cross an 
infinite number of halves.
The traditional way to solve this problem is with 
calculus, where you can show that even though 
there are an infinite number of halves, it’s 
possible to cross them all in a finite amount of 
time. (Unfortunately for generations of stymied 
philosophers, calculus was invented by Newton 
and Leibnitz 2,000 years after Zeno posed his 
problem.)
As it turns out, during my sophomore year I 
solved Zeno’s paradox in my calculus course 
the same semester that I learned about Planck 
units in my modern physics course. It occurred 
to me that if the Planck length were really 
the shortest distance allowed by nature, the 
quantum of distance, it offered a physical 
resolution to the paradox.
In my view, when your distance from the 
opposite shore reaches the Planck length, you 
can’t go half anymore. Your only options are to 
go the whole Planck length or go nowhere. In 
essence, I pictured you “slipping” along that 
last tiny little bit of space without ever actually 
cutting the distance in half.
When I first came up with this idea as an 
undergraduate physics major, I was extremely 
impressed with myself. I have since learned 
that I’m not the only person to have come up 
with this connection between Planck length 
and Zeno’s paradox. Despite that, I’m still 
somewhat impressed with myself.

uring the mid-1900s, physicists further explored the foundations of 
quantum physics and the components of matter. They focused on the 
study of particles in a field that became known as particle physics. More of 
these itty-bitty particles seemed to spring up every time physicists looked for 
them! By 1974, physicists had determined a set of rules and principles called 
the Standard Model of particle physics — a model that includes all interactions 
except for gravity.
Here I explore the Standard Model of particle physics and how it relates to 
string theory. Any complete string theory will have to include the features 
of the Standard Model and also extend beyond it to include gravity as well. 
In this chapter, I describe the structure of the atom, including the smaller 
particles contained within it, and the scientific methods used to explain the 
interactions holding matter together. I identify the two categories of particles 
that exist in our universe, fermions and bosons, and the different rules they 
follow. Finally, I point out the problems that remain from the Standard Model, 
which string theory hopes to resolve.
The topics related to the development of the Standard Model of particle 
physics are detailed and fascinating in their own right, but this book is about 
string theory. So my review of the material in this chapter is necessarily 
brief and is in no way intended to be a complete look at the subject. Many 
of the initial topics regarding the discovery of the structure of the atom are 
recounted in Einstein For Dummies (Wiley), and many other popular books 
are available to explore some of the more involved concepts of particle 
physics that come along later.

Atoms, Atoms, Everywhere Atoms: 
Introducing Atomic Theory
Physicist Richard P. Feynman once said that if he could boil down the most 
important principles of physics to a single sentence, it would be, “All things 
are made of atoms.” (He actually goes on to expand on this, meaning that he 
actually boiled physics down to a compound sentence. For our immediate 
purposes, this first bit is enough.) The structure of atoms determines 
fundamental properties of matter in our universe, such as how atoms 
interact with each other in chemical combinations. The study of physics at 
the scale of an atom is called atomic theory, or atomic physics. Though this is 
several scales above the scale that string theory operates on, understanding 
the smaller structure of matter requires some level of understanding of the 
atomic-level structure.
Ancient Greeks considered the question of whether you could divide an object 
forever. Some — such as the fifth century B.C. philosopher Democritus — 
believed that you would eventually reach a smallest chunk of matter that 
couldn’t be divided any more, and they called these smallest chunks atoms.
Aristotle’s view that matter was composed of five basic elements was 
adopted by most philosophers of the time and remained the dominant way 
of thinking for many years, well into the time that “natural philosophy” began 
its transition into “science.” After all, no scientists or philosophers had ever 
seen a smallest chunk of matter, so there really wasn’t any reason to suppose 
they existed.
This began to change in 1738 when Swiss mathematician David Bernoulli 
explained how pressurized gas behaved by assuming that gas was made up 
of tiny particles. The heat of a gas was related to the speed of the particles. 
(This built on the work of Robert Boyle, nearly a century earlier.)
In 1808, British chemist John Dalton tried to explain the behavior of 
elements — substances that can’t be chemically broken down into simpler 
substances — by assuming that they were made up of atoms.
	
According to Dalton, each atom of an element was identical to other atoms of 
the same element, and they combined together in specific ways to form the 
more complex substances we see in our universe.
Over the next century, evidence for the atomic theory mounted (see the 
sidebar “Einstein’s contribution to atomic theory”). The complex structures 
formed by different atoms were called molecules, though the exact mechanism 
for how atoms formed molecules was still unclear.

121
 Chapter 8: The Standard Model of Particle Physics
	
It took more than 150 years from the time of Bernoulli for physicists to fully 
adopt the atomic model. Then, as you find out in the next section, after it was 
finally adopted, it was found to be incomplete! The complications arising in 
the study of string theory may well prove to take just as long, and perhaps 
ultimately be just as incomplete. But that doesn’t mean they’re necessarily 
“wrong,” any more than atomic theory is “wrong.”
Popping Open the Atomic Hood 
and Seeing What’s Inside
Today scientists know that these atoms are not, as the Greeks imagined, the 
smallest chunks of matter. Scientists quickly realized that atoms had multiple 
parts inside of them:
	
✓	Negatively charged electrons circling the nucleus
	
✓	Positively charged nucleus
The particles that compose the nucleus (it’s made up of smaller pieces, too) 
and electrons are among the particles, along with several others, that the 
Standard Model of particle physics explains, and ultimately that string theory 
should also explain.
Einstein’s contribution to atomic theory
As if he weren’t credited with enough, Albert 
Einstein is also frequently cited as the person 
who provided some of the last definitive 
support for the atomic theory of matter in two of 
his 1905 papers.
One of the papers was his PhD thesis, in which 
he calculated the approximate mass of an atom 
and the size of sugar molecules. This work 
earned him his doctorate from the University of 
Zurich.
The other paper involved analyzing random 
motion in smoke and liquids. This type of motion 
is called Brownian motion and had puzzled 
physicists for some time. Einstein pictured the 
motion as the result of atoms of smoke or liquid 
being jostled around by atoms of the surrounding 
gas or liquid, which explained the phenomenon 
perfectly. His predictions were supported by 
experimental findings.

Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Discovering the electron
The electron is a negatively charged particle contained within the atom. It 
was discovered in 1897 by British physicist J.J. Thomson, though charged 
particles (including the name “electron”) had been hypothesized earlier.
Some physicists had already hypothesized that units of charge might be 
flowing around in electrical apparatus. (Benjamin Franklin proposed such an 
idea as early as the 1700s.) Technology only caught up to this idea in the late 
1800s, with the creation of the cathode ray tube, shown in Figure 8-1.

Cathode 
+ 
 
Anode 
Battery
In a cathode ray tube, a pair of metal disks is connected to a battery. The 
metal disks are placed inside a sealed glass tube that contains no air — a 
vacuum tube. The electrical voltage causes one of the metal plates to become 
positively charged (an anode) and one to become negatively charged (the 
cathode, from which the device gets its name). Cathode ray tubes are the 
basis of traditional television and computer monitor tubes.
When the electrical current was switched on, the tube would begin to glow 
green. In 1897, Thomson was head of the Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge, 
England, and set about to test the properties of this cathode ray tube glow. 
He discovered that the glow was due to a beam of negatively charged particles 
flying between the plates. These negatively charged particles later came to 
be called electrons. Thomson also figured out that the electrons were 
incredibly light — 2,000 times lighter than a hydrogen atom.
	
Thomson not only discovered the electron, but he theorized that the electron 
was part of the atom (atoms weren’t a completely accepted idea at the time) 
that somehow got knocked free from the cathode and flowed through the 
vacuum to the anode. With this discovery, scientists began discovering ways 
to explore the inside of atoms.

123
 Chapter 8: The Standard Model of Particle Physics
The nucleus is the thing in the middle
In the center of the atom is a dense ball of matter, called a nucleus, with a 
positive electrical charge. Shortly after electrons were discovered, it became 
clear that if you extracted an electron from an atom, the atom was left with 
a slightly positive electrical charge. For a while, the assumption was that the 
atom was a positively charged mass that contained negative electrons inside 
of it, like pieces of negatively charged fruit in a positively charged fruitcake. 
The entire fruitcake would be neutral unless you extracted some fruit from 
it. (Scientists of the day, being of a different dietary constitution than most of 
us today, explained it as plum pudding instead of fruitcake. Plum pudding or 
fruitcake — it unappetizingly amounts to roughly the same picture.)
In 1909, however, an experiment by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, 
working under Ernest Rutherford, challenged this picture. These scientists 
fired positively charged particles at a thin sheet of gold foil. Most of the 
particles passed straight through the foil, but every once in a while one of 
them bounced back sharply. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge 
of the gold atom wasn’t spread throughout the atom in the fruitcake model, 
but was concentrated in a small positively charged nucleus, and that the rest 
of the atom was empty space. The particles that bounced were the ones that 
hit this nucleus.
Watching the dance inside an atom
In trying to figure out the atom’s structure, a natural model for scientists to 
look to was the planetary model, as shown in Figure 8-2. The electrons move 
around the nucleus in orbits. Physicist Niels Bohr determined that these 
orbits were governed by the same quantum rules that Max Planck had originally 
applied in 1900 — that energy had to be transferred in discrete packets.
In astronomy, the Earth and sun are attracted to each other by gravity, but 
because Earth is in motion around the sun, they never come into contact. A 
similar model could explain why the negative and positive portions of the 
atom never came into contact.
The first planetary model was proposed in 1904 by Nobel Prize-winner 
Hantaro Nagaoka. It was based on the rings of Saturn and called the Saturnian 
model. Certain details of the model were disproved by experiment, and 
Nagaoka abandoned the model in 1908, but Ernest Rutherford revised the 
concept to create his own planetary model in 1911, which was more consistent 
with experimental evidence.

When atoms emitted electrons, the electron’s energy followed certain precise 
patterns. Bohr realized in 1913 that this meant Rutherford’s model required 
some revision. To fit the patterns, he applied the idea that energy was 
quantized, or bundled together in certain quantities, which allowed for stable 
orbits (instead of the collapsing orbits predicted by electromagnetism). Each 
electron could only exist in a certain, precisely defined energy state within its 
orbit. To go from one orbit to a different orbit required the electron to have 
enough energy to jump from one energy state to another.
	
Because of the quantum nature of the system, adding half the amount of 
energy to go from one orbit to another didn’t move the electron halfway 
between those orbits. The electron remained in the first orbit until it received 
enough energy to kick it all the way into the higher-energy state. This is yet 
more of the strange behavior you’ve (hopefully) come to expect from quantum 
physics.
The Rutherford-Bohr model works pretty well in describing the hydrogen 
atom, but as atoms get more complex, the model begins to break down. Still, 
the basic principles hold for all atoms:
	
✓	A nucleus is at the center of an atom.
	
✓	Electrons move in orbits around the nucleus.
	
✓	The electron orbits are quantized (they have discrete energy levels) 
and are governed by the rules of quantum physics (though it would 
take several years for those rules to become developed, as described in 
Chapter 7).

The Quantum Picture of the Photon: 
Quantum Electrodynamics
The development of the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) was one of 
the great intellectual achievements of the 20th century. Physicists were able 
to redefine electromagnetism by using the new rules of quantum mechanics, 
unifying quantum theory and electromagnetic theory. Quantum electrodynamics 
was one of the first quantum approaches to a quantum field theory (described 
in the next section), so it introduced many features possessed by string 
theory (which is also a quantum field theory).
Quantum electrodynamics began with the attempt to describe particles 
in terms of quantum fields, starting in the late 1920s. In the 1940s, QED 
was completed three distinct times — by the Japanese physicist Sin-Itiro 
Tomonaga during World War II and later by American physicists Richard 
Feynman and Julian Schwinger. These three physicists shared the 1965 Nobel 
Prize in Physics for this work.
Dr. Feynman’s doodles explain how 
particles exchange information
Though the principles of quantum electrodynamics were worked out by 
three individuals, the most famous founder of QED was undeniably Richard 
P. Feynman. Feynman was equally good at the mathematics and explanation 
of a theory, which resulted in his creation of Feynman diagrams — a visual 
representation of the mathematics that went on in QED.
Richard Phillips Feynman is one of the most interesting characters in 20th 
century physics, easily ranking with Einstein in personality, if not in pure 
fame. Early on in his career, Feynman made the conscious decision to only 
work on problems that he found interesting, something that certainly served 
him well. Fortunately for the world of physics, one of these problems was 
quantum electrodynamics.
	
Because electromagnetism is a field theory, the result of QED was a quantum 
field theory — a quantum theory that contains a value at every point in space. 
You can imagine that the mathematics of such a theory was intimidating, to 
say the least, even to those trained in physics and mathematics.
Feynman was brilliant not only with physical theory and mathematics, 
but also with explanation. One way he simplified things was through the 
application of his Feynman diagrams. Though the math was still complex, 

126
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
the diagrams meant you could begin talking about the physics without 
needing all the complexity of the equations. And when you did need the 
actual numbers, the diagrams helped organize your computations.
In Figure 8-3, you can see a Feynman diagram of two electrons approaching 
each other. The Feynman diagram is set on a Minkowski space, as introduced 
in Chapter 6, which depicts events in space-time. The electrons are the solid 
lines (called propagators), and as they get near to each other, a photon (the 
squiggly propagator; see Chapter 7 for the basics of photons) is exchanged 
between the two electrons.

In other words, in QED two particles communicate their electromagnetic 
information by emitting and absorbing a photon. A photon that acts in this 
manner is called a virtual photon or a messenger photon, because it’s created 
solely for the purpose of exchanging this information. This was the key insight 
of QED, because without this exchange of a photon, there was no way to 
explain how the information was communicated between the two electrons.
Also (and perhaps more important from a physics standpoint), a quantum field 
theory (at least those that seem to match our real world) quickly reaches 
infinity if distances become too small. To see how these infinities can arise, 
consider both the fact that electromagnetic forces get larger at small distances 
(infinitely larger at infinitely small distances) and also the distance and 
momentum relationship from the uncertainty principle of quantum 
mechanics (see Chapter 6 for details of the uncertainty principle). Even 
talking about the instances where two electrons are incredibly close to each 
other (such as within a Planck length) becomes effectively impossible in a 
world governed by quantum physics.

127
 Chapter 8: The Standard Model of Particle Physics
	
By quantizing electromagnetics, as QED does, Feynman, Schwinger, and 
Tomonaga were able to use the theory despite these infinities. The infinities 
were still present, but because the virtual photon meant that the electrons 
didn’t need to get so close to each other, there weren’t as many infinities, and 
the ones that were left didn’t enter physical predictions. Feynman, Schwinger, 
and Tomonaga took an infinite theory and extracted finite predictions. One of 
the major motivations for the drive to develop a successful string theory is to 
go even further and get an actually finite theory.
	
The mathematical process of removing infinities is called renormalization. 
This is a set of mathematical techniques that can be applied to provide a 
very carefully defined limit for the continuum of values contained in the field. 
Instead of adding up all the infinite terms in the calculation and getting an 
infinite result, physicists have found that applying renormalization allows 
them to redefine parameters within the summation so it adds up to a finite 
amount! Without introducing renormalization, the values become infinite, and 
we certainly don’t observe these infinities in nature. With renormalization, 
however, physicists get unambiguous predictions that are among the most 
precise and best-tested results in all of science.
Discovering that other kind 
of matter: Antimatter
Along with the understanding of quantum electrodynamics, there came 
a growing understanding that there existed antimatter, a different form 
of matter that was identical to known matter, but with opposite charge. 
Quantum field theory indicated that for each particle, there existed an 
antiparticle. The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron.
In 1928, physicist Paul Dirac was creating the quantum theory of the electron 
(a necessary precursor to a complete QED theory), when he realized that 
the equation only worked if you allowed these extra particles — identical to 
electrons but with opposite charge — to exist. Just four years later, the first 
positrons were discovered and named by Carl D. Anderson while he was 
analyzing cosmic rays.
	
The mathematics of the theory implied a symmetry between the known particles 
and identical particles with opposite charge, a prediction that eventually 
proved to be correct. The theory demanded that antimatter exist. String 
theory implies another type of symmetry, called supersymmetry (see 
Chapter 10), which has yet to be proved, but which many physicists believe 
will eventually be discovered in nature.

128
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
When antimatter comes in contact with ordinary matter, the two types of 
matter annihilate each other in a burst of energy in the form of a photon. 
This can also be depicted in QED with a Feynman diagram, as shown on the 
left side of Figure 8-4. In this view, the positron is like an electron that moves 
backward through time (as indicated by the direction of the arrow on the 
propagator).

Sometimes a particle is only virtual
In quantum electrodynamics, virtual particles can exist briefly, arising from 
the energy fluctuations of the quantum fields that exist at every point in 
space. Some virtual particles — such as the photon in Figure 8-3 — exist just 
long enough to communicate information about a force. Other virtual particles 
spring into existence, seemingly for no purpose other than to make the lives 
of physicists more interesting.
	
The existence of virtual particles is one of the strangest aspects of physics, 
but it’s a direct consequence of quantum physics. Virtual particles can exist 
because the uncertainty principle, in essence, allows them to carry a large 
fluctuation of energy, so long as they exist for only a brief period of time.
The right side of Figure 8-4 shows a pair of virtual particles — this time an 
electron and a positron. In some cases, a photon can actually split into an 
electron and positron and then recombine back into a photon.

129
 Chapter 8: The Standard Model of Particle Physics
The problem is that even though these particles are virtual, their effects have 
to be taken into account when performing calculations about what takes 
place in a given area. So no matter what you’re doing, an infinite number of 
strange virtual particles are springing into and out of existence all around 
you, wreaking havoc with the smooth orderly calculations that you’d like 
to perform! (If this sounds familiar, it’s because this is the quantum foam 
discussed in Chapter 2.)
Digging into the Nucleus: 
Quantum Chromodynamics
As quantum physics attempted to expand into the nucleus of the atom, new 
tactics were required. The quantum theory of the atomic nucleus, and the 
particles that make it up, is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). String 
theory arose out of an attempt to explain this same behavior.
In the explanation of QED in the previous section, the only participants in 
QED were the photon and the electron (and, briefly, the positron). In fact, QED 
attempted to simplify the situation by only analyzing these two aspects of 
the atom, which it could do by treating the nucleus as a giant, very distant 
object. With QED finally in place, physicists were ready to take a good hard 
look at the nucleus of the atom.
The pieces that make up 
the nucleus: Nucleons
The nucleus of an atom is composed of particles called nucleons, which come 
in two types: positively charged protons and the noncharged neutrons. The 
protons were discovered in 1919, while the neutrons were discovered in 1932.
The proton is about 1,836 times as massive as the electron. The neutron is 
about the same size as the proton, so the pair of them is substantially larger 
than the electron. Despite this difference in size, the proton and electron 
have identical electrical charges, but of opposite sign; the proton is positive 
while the electron is negative.
The growth of technology allowed for the design and construction of larger 
and more powerful particle accelerators, which physicists use to smash particles 
into each other and see what comes out. With great delight, physicists began 
smashing protons into each other, in the hopes of finding out what was 
inside of them.

130
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
In fact, this work on trying to uncover the secrets of these nucleons would 
lead directly to the first insights into string theory. A young physicist at 
CERN applied an obscure mathematical formula to describe the behavior of 
particles in a particle accelerator, and this is seen by many as the starting 
point of string theory. (These events are covered in more detail in Chapter 10.)
The pieces that make up the 
nucleon’s pieces: Quarks
Today, the nucleons are known to be types of hadrons, which are particles 
made up of even smaller particles called quarks. The concept of quarks was 
independently proposed by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964 
(though the name, taken from James Joyce’s Finnegan’s Wake, is pure Gell-
Mann), which in part earned Gell-Mann the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics. The 
quarks are held together by still other particles, called gluons.
In this model, both the proton and the neutron are composed of three 
quarks. These quarks have quantum properties, such as mass, electrical 
charge, and spin (see the next section for an explanation of spin). There 
are actually a total of six flavors (or types) of quarks, all of which have been 
experimentally observed:
	
✓	Up quark
	
✓	Down quark
	
✓	Charm quark
	
✓	Strange quark
	
✓	Top quark
	
✓	Bottom quark
The properties of the proton and neutron are determined by the specific 
combination of quarks that compose them. For example, a proton’s charge 
is reached by adding up the electrical charge of the three quarks inside it — 
two up quarks and one down quark. In fact, every proton is made of two up 
quarks and one down quark, so they’re all exactly alike. Every neutron is 
identical to every other neutron (composed of one up quark and two down 
quarks).
In addition to standard quantum mechanical properties (charge, mass, and 
spin), quarks have another property, which came out of the theory, called 
color charge. This is somewhat similar to electrical charge in principle, but 
it’s an entirely distinct property of quarks. It comes in three varieties, named 

131
 Chapter 8: The Standard Model of Particle Physics
red, green, and blue. (Quarks don’t actually have these colors, because 
they’re much, much smaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are 
just names to keep track of the types of charge.)
Because QED describes the quantum theory of the electrical charge, QCD 
describes the quantum theory of the color charge. The color charge is the 
source of the name quantum chromodynamics, because “chroma” is Greek 
for “color.”
In addition to the quarks, there exist particles called gluons. The gluons bind 
the quarks together, kind of like rubber bands (in a very metaphoric sense). 
These gluons are the gauge bosons for the strong nuclear force, just as the 
photons are the gauge bosons for electromagnetism (see the later section on 
gauge bosons for more on these particles).
Looking into the Types of Particles
Physicists have found a large number of particles, and one thing that proves 
useful is that they can be broken down into categories based on their 
properties. Physicists have found a lot of ways to do this, but in the following 
sections I briefly discuss some of the most relevant categories to string 
theory.
According to quantum mechanics, particles have a property known as spin. 
This isn’t an actual motion of the particle, but in a quantum mechanical 
sense, it means that the particle always interacts with other particles as if it’s 
rotating in a certain way. In quantum physics, spin has a numerical value that 
can be either an integer (0, 1, 2, and so on) or half-integer (1⁄2, 3⁄2, and so on). 
Particles that have an integer spin are called bosons, while particles that have 
half-integer spin are called fermions.
Particles of force: Bosons
Bosons, named after Satyendra Nath Bose, are particles that have an integer 
value of quantum spin. The bosons that are known act as carriers of forces in 
quantum field theory, as the photon does in Figure 8-3. The Standard Model 
of particle physics predicts five fundamental bosons, four of which have been 
observed:
	
✓	Photon
	
✓	Gluon (there are eight types of gluons)

132
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
	
✓	Z boson
	
✓	W boson (actually two particles — the W+ and W– bosons)
	
✓	Higgs boson (this one hasn’t been found yet)
In addition, many physicists believe that there probably exists a boson called 
the graviton, which is related to gravity. The relationship of these bosons to 
the forces of physics are covered in the “Gauge Bosons: Particles Holding 
Other Particles Together” section later in this chapter.
Composite bosons can also exist; these are formed by combining together an 
even number of different fermions. For example, a carbon-12 atom contains 
six protons and six neutrons, all of which are fermions. The nucleus of a 
carbon-12 atom is, therefore, a composite boson. Mesons, on the other hand, 
are particles made up of exactly two quarks, so they are also composite 
bosons.
Particles of matter: Fermions
Fermions, named after Enrico Fermi, are particles that have a half-integer 
value of quantum spin. Unlike bosons, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, 
which means that multiple fermions can’t exist in the same quantum state.
While bosons are seen as mediating the forces of nature, fermions are par­
ticles that are a bit more “solid” and are what we tend to think of matter par­
ticles. Quarks are fermions.
In addition to quarks, there is a second family of fermions called leptons. 
Leptons are elementary particles that can’t (so far as scientists know) be 
broken down into smaller particles. The electron is a lepton, but the Standard 
Model of particle physics tells us that there are actually three generations 
of particles, each heavier than the last. (The three generations of particles 
were predicted by theoretical considerations before they were discovered by 
experiment, an excellent example of how theory can precede experiment in 
quantum field theory.)
Also within each generation of particles are two flavors of quarks. Table 8-1 
shows the 12 types of fundamental fermions, all of which have been 
observed. The numbers shown in Table 8-1 are the masses, in terms of 
energy, for each of the known particles. (Neutrinos have virtually, but not 
exactly, zero mass.)

There are also, of course, composite fermions, made when an odd number 
of fermions combine to create a new particle, such as how protons and 
neutrons are formed by combining quarks.
Gauge Bosons: Particles Holding 
Other Particles Together
In the Standard Model of particle physics, the forces can be explained in 
terms of gauge theories, which possess certain mathematical properties. 
These forces transmit their influence through particles called gauge bosons. 
String theory allows gravity to be expressed in terms of a gauge theory, 
which is one of its benefits. (One example of this is the AdS/CFT correspondence 
discussed in Chapter 11.)
Throughout the development of the Standard Model, it became clear that all 
the forces (or, as many physicists prefer, interactions) in physics could be 
broken down into four basic types:
	
✓	Electromagnetism
	
✓	Gravity
	
✓	Weak nuclear force
	
✓	Strong nuclear force
The electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force were consolidated in the 
1960s by Sheldon Lee Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg into a 
single force called the electroweak force. This force, in combination with 
quantum chromodynamics (which defined the strong nuclear force), is what 
physicists mean when they talk about the Standard Model of particle physics.

134
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
One key element of the Standard Model of particle physics is that it’s a gauge 
theory, which means certain types of symmetries are inherent in the theory; 
in other words, the dynamics of the system stay the same under certain 
types of transformations. A force that operates through a gauge field is 
transmitted with a gauge boson. The following gauge bosons have been 
observed by scientists for three of the forces of nature:
	
✓	Electromagnetism — photon
	
✓	Strong nuclear force — gluon
	
✓	Weak nuclear force — Z, W+, and W– bosons
	
In addition, gravity can be written as a gauge theory, which means that there 
should exist a gauge boson that mediates gravity. The name for this theoretical 
gauge boson is the graviton. (In Chapter 10, you see how the discovery of the 
graviton in the equations of string theory led to its development as a theory of 
quantum gravity.)
Exploring the Theory of Where 
Mass Comes From
In the Standard Model of particle physics, particles get their mass through 
something called the Higgs mechanism. The Higgs mechanism is based on 
the existence of a Higgs field, which permeates all of space. The Higgs field 
creates a type of particle called a Higgs boson. For the Higgs field to create 
a Higgs boson takes a lot of energy, and physicists have so far been unable 
to create one — so it’s the only particle predicted by the Standard Model of 
particle physics that hasn’t been observed. This, together with attempts to 
find new particles, such as those motivated by string theory, are among the 
major reasons why scientists need advanced particle accelerators for more 
high-energy experiments.
The weak nuclear force falls off very rapidly above short distances. 
According to quantum field theory, this means that the particles mediating 
the force — the W and Z bosons — must have a mass (as opposed to the 
gluons and photons, which are massless).
The problem is that the gauge theories described in the preceding section 
are mediated only by massless particles. If the gauge bosons have mass, then 
a gauge theory can’t be sensibly defined. The Higgs mechanism avoids this 
problem by introducing a new field called the Higgs field. At high energies, 
where the gauge theory is defined, the gauge bosons are massless, and the 
theory works as anticipated. At low energies, the field triggers broken 
symmetries that allow the particles to have mass.

135
 Chapter 8: The Standard Model of Particle Physics
If the Higgs field does exist, it would create particles known as Higgs bosons. 
The mass of the Higgs boson isn’t something that the theory tells us, but 
most physicists anticipate it to be found in the range of 150 GeV. Fortunately, 
this is within the realm of what we can experimentally search for. Finding the 
Higgs boson would be the final confirmation of the Standard Model of particle 
physics.
The Higgs mechanism, Higgs field, and Higgs boson are named after Scottish 
physicist Peter Higgs. Though he wasn’t the first to propose these concepts, 
he’s the one they were named after, which is just one of those things that 
sometimes happens in physics.
	
For a discussion on the Higgs mechanism in depth, I recommend Lisa 
Randall’s Warped Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe’s Hidden 
Dimensions. Chapter 10 of that book is devoted entirely to this topic. You 
could also look to The God Particle: If the Answer is the Universe, What is 
the Question? by Nobel Laureate Leon Lederman and Dick Teresi, which is 
devoted entirely to the topic of the search for the Higgs boson.
From Big to Small: The Hierarchy 
Problem in Physics
The Standard Model of particle physics is an astounding success, but it 
hasn’t answered every question that physics hands to it. One of the major 
questions that remains is the hierarchy problem, which seeks an explanation 
for the diverse values that the Standard Model lets physicists work with. 
Many physicists feel that string theory will ultimately be successful at 
resolving the hierarchy problem.
For example, if you count the theoretical Higgs boson (and both types of W 
bosons), the Standard Model of particle physics has 18 elementary particles. 
The masses of these particles aren’t predicted by the Standard Model. 
Physicists had to find these by experiment and plug them into the equations 
to get everything to work out right.
If you look back at Table 8-1, you notice three families of particles among the 
fermions, which seems like a lot of unnecessary duplication. If we already 
have an electron, why does nature need to have a muon that’s 200 times as 
heavy? Why do we have so many types of quarks?
Beyond that, when you look at the energy scales associated with the quantum 
field theories of the Standard Model, as shown in Figure 8-5, even more 
questions may occur to you. Why is there a gap of 16 orders of magnitude (16 
zeroes!) between the intensity of the Planck scale energy and the weak scale?

136
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
	
Figure 8-5: 
The hierar-
chy problem 
in physics 
relates 
to the 
large gap 
between the 
weak scale 
and Planck 
scale of 
length and 
energy.
	
At the bottom of this scale is the vacuum energy, which is the energy generated 
by all the strange quantum behavior in empty space — virtual particles 
exploding into existence and quantum fields fluctuating wildly due to the 
uncertainty principle.
The hierarchy problem occurs because the fundamental parameters of the 
Standard Model don’t reveal anything about these scales of energy. Just as 
physicists have to put the particles and their masses into the theory by hand, 
so too have they had to construct the energy scales by hand. Fundamental 
principles of physics don’t tell scientists how to transition smoothly from 
talking about the weak scale to talking about the Planck scale.
As I explain in Chapter 2, trying to understand the “gap” between the weak 
scale and the Planck scale is one of the major motivating factors behind 
trying to search for a quantum gravity theory in general, and string theory in 
particular. Many physicists would like a single theory that could be applied 
at all scales, without the need for renormalization (the mathematical process 
of removing infinities), or at least to understand what properties of nature 
determine the rules that work for different scales. Others are perfectly happy 
with renormalization, which has been a major tool of physics for nearly 40 
years and works in virtually every problem that physicists run into.

O
ne of mankind’s first scientific acts was probably to look into the 
heavens and ask questions about the nature of that expansive universe. 
Today, scientists are still fascinated by these questions, and with good 
reason. Though we know much more than our cave-dwelling ancestors did 
about what makes up the heavens, the black space between the stars still 
holds many mysteries — and string theory is at the heart of the search for 
the answers to many of these mysteries.
In this chapter, you find out what physicists, astronomers, astrophysicists, 
and cosmologists have uncovered about the workings of the universe 
independent of string theory. As these scientists have discovered how the 
universe works, their findings have led to more difficult questions, which 
string theorists hope to answer. I cover some of these more complex points 
about the universe in Chapter 14. This chapter gives you the background 
that will help you understand the ties between cosmology, astrophysics, and 
string theory.
In the following pages, I explore the consequences of Einstein’s relativity, 
where scientists find that the universe seems to have had a beginning. At 
this point, scientists were able to determine where the particles in our 
universe come from. The theory of the universe’s origin grows more complex 
with the introduction of a rapidly expanding early universe. I also introduce 
you to two of cosmology’s biggest mysteries: the presence of unseen dark 
matter and of repulsive gravity in the form of dark energy. Finally, I provide 
a glimpse into black holes, objects that later become important to string 
theory.

Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Creating an Incorrect Model 
of the Universe
Before string theory, there was Einstein’s relativity, and before that was 
Newton’s gravity, and for about two centuries before Newton, the laws 
governing the universe were believed, by most of the Western world, to be 
those set out by Aristotle. Understanding the later revolutions in cosmology 
starts with the original models of the universe developed by the ancient Greeks.
Aristotle assigns realms to the universe
Aristotle pictured a universe that was made of a substance called the aether 
(see Chapter 5 for more about this elusive element). The heavens, to him and 
his followers, were a place of unsurpassed geometric elegance and beauty 
that didn’t change over time.
In some ways, Aristotle is seen as one of the first scientists. He spent a great 
deal of time discussing the importance of observation to understand nature. 
Aristotle described the universe as containing five fundamental elements: 
earth, air, fire, water, and aether. The heavens were the realm of aether, but 
we were stuck down with the earth, air, fire, and water.
Aristotle knew Earth was a sphere, and he thought that each element had a 
natural location within that sphere, as shown in Figure 9-1. The natural 
location of the earth element was at the center of the sphere — this was 
considered the earth realm. Next came the water realm, followed by the air, 
fire, and finally aether realms. (The moon resided somewhere on the border 
of the aether realm, probably right on the edge of the fire realm.)
The clouds — composed of air and water elements — drifted in the air, along 
the border of the air and water realms. You can mix water and earth to make 
mud, but the earth part tends to eventually settle on the bottom because the 
earth realm is beneath the water realm. When a fire was ignited, the flames 
reached up into the sky in an effort to reach the fire realm, where the sun 
resided.
In Aristotle’s model, the outermost sphere was the aether realm, relatively 
untouched by the mundane elements, aside from the moon (hardly mundane) 
and its border with the fire realm. It was a perfect realm, which contained the 
stars, fixed in place on a serene, eternal background. This belief defined the 
heavens for well over a thousand years.

Ptolemy puts Earth at the center of the 
universe (and the Catholic Church agrees)
The cosmological model of the stars’ movements built on Aristotle’s 
philosophy was called the Ptolemaic model, after the man who invented it.
Ptolemy lived in Roman Egypt during the second century AD, doing his 
principle work in the city of Alexandria. His book on astronomy, the Almagest 
(which roughly translates to “the greatest”) was written in approximately 150 
AD. The greatest achievement of this volume was to attempt to describe the 
motion of the heavens in precise mathematical language.
The model described by Ptolemy, and maintained by most scholars until the 
time of Copernicus and Galileo, was a geosynchronous model of the heavens, 
in which Earth was at the center of the universe. The reason for such a model 
is obvious from Aristotle’s elemental spheres depicted in Figure 9-1: Earth 
has a distinct, unique place in the universe.
In Ptolemy’s geosynchronous model, the moon, planets, and sun are 
mounted on rotating spheres around Earth. Beyond the planets is the largest 
sphere, which has the stars mounted on it. This model accurately predicted 
the motion of the planets, so it was well received.
The Catholic Church adopted this model of the universe for a number of 
reasons. One is that it provided a way for the sun to be “held still” in the sky 
to match a Biblical account. Another reason is that the theory said nothing 
about what was outside the star-laden spheres, so it left plenty of room for 
heaven and hell.

140
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Perhaps most significantly, the Church embraced the belief that Earth and 
the heavens were made of different things. Our realm was special. In all of 
space there was nothing else quite like Earth, and certainly no other place 
that could give rise to anything resembling humanity. With the Catholic 
Church’s official endorsement, the Ptolemaic model of the universe became 
not just a scientific theory, but a religious fact.
So many scientists, so many names
The names for different types of space 
scientists can get rather confusing. Gone are 
the days when anyone who looked through 
a telescope could be called an astronomer. 
The distinction between astronomer and 
astrophysicist is pretty much history, and the 
line between astrophysicist and cosmologist 
gets blurry in the realm of string theory. The 
term used is often chosen out of personal 
preference, but there are some guidelines:
	✓	Astronomer: This is the classical term 
for a scientist who studies the heavens. 
Since Galileo, optical telescopes have 
been the primary tool used to examine 
celestial bodies. Today, the telescopes can 
be radio, x-ray, or gamma ray telescopes, 
which see light in the nonvisual spectrum. 
Traditionally, astronomers have devoted 
more time to classification and description 
of bodies in space than to attempting to 
explain the phenomena.
	✓	Astrologer: In the time of Ptolemy through 
Copernicus, the terms astrologer and 
astronomer were essentially synonyms. 
Since Copernicus, they have become more 
distinct; today they represent radically 
different disciplines, with astrology well 
outside the bounds of science. An astrologer 
tries to find a connection between human 
behaviors and the motion of celestial 
bodies, generally with a vague or 
supernatural mechanism introduced as the 
basis for these connections. See Astrology 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Rea Orion 
(Wiley) for more information on the field.
	✓	Astrophysicist: This term applies to 
someone who studies the physics of 
interactions within and between stellar 
bodies. Astrophysicists seek to apply the 
principles of physics to create general 
laws governing the behavior of these 
interactions.
	✓	Cosmologist: This term is used for a type of 
astrophysicist who focuses on the evolution 
of the universe — the processes of how the 
universe changes over time. A cosmologist 
rarely cares about a specific stellar body or 
solar system, and galaxies are frequently 
too parochial for these explorers of space. 
Cosmologists often focus their attention on 
theories that use unimaginably large scales 
of time, space, and energy. The study of 
the big bang, or the universe’s end, is an 
example of the cosmologist’s domain.

141
 Chapter 9: Physics in Space: Considering Cosmology and Astrophysics
The Enlightened Universe: 
Some Changes Allowed
In the 1500s, the geosynchronous model was replaced with the heliocentric 
model, in which the sun was at the center of the solar system. (Heliocentric 
models had originally been proposed by Greeks such as Aristarchus, 
but Aristotle’s model gained greater popularity.) The work of Nicholas 
Copernicus and Galileo Galilei was key to this revolution, which dislodged us 
from our special place at the center of the universe. The result has become 
known as the Copernican principle, which says that space looks the same no 
matter where you view it from.
Copernicus corrects what’s 
where in the universe
The Ptolemaic model was based on the idea that all the celestial objects — 
planets, moons, stars, and so on — were on concentric spheres, each of 
which was centered on Earth. Over the centuries (from about 150 BC to 1500 
AD), though, observations made it clear that this wasn’t the case.
To preserve the Ptolemaic model, it was modified over the years. Celestial 
objects were mounted on spheres that were then mounted on other spheres. 
The very elegance that made the Ptolemaic model so appealing was gone, 
replaced with a mishmash of geometric nonsense that only partially 
conformed with scientific observations — which were growing more and 
more precise due to new technologies.
This was the prime time for a scientific revolution. The existing theory was 
failing, but without another system in place to adopt (the heliocentric models 
of Aristarchus were ignored, for some reason), the prevailing system continued 
to be modified in increasingly improbable ways (check out Chapter 4 for 
more on this process). In the case of the Ptolemaic model, the fact that 
contradicting it was heretical didn’t help incite a scientific revolution either.
In his book, On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres, the Polish astronomer 
Nicholas Copernicus explained his heliocentric model, making it clear that 
the sun, not Earth, sat at center stage. He still used spheres, though, and 
made other assumptions that haven’t born the test of time, but it was a major 
improvement over the Ptolemaic model.

142
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Copernicus published his heliocentric model upon his death in 1543, fearing 
retribution from the Church if he published it earlier (although he did hand 
out versions of the theory to friends about 30 years earlier). Some Indian 
writers made this heliocentric claim as far back as the seventh century AD, 
and some Islamic astronomers and mathematicians studied this idea as well, 
but it’s unclear to what degree Copernicus was aware of their work.
	
Copernicus was a theorist, not an observational astronomer. His key insight 
was the idea that Earth didn’t have a distinct position within the universe, a 
concept that was named the Copernican principle in the mid-20th century.
Beholding the movements 
of heavenly bodies
One of the greatest observational astronomers of this revolutionary age 
was Tycho Brahe, a Danish nobleman who lived from 1546 to 1601. Brahe 
made an astounding number of detailed astronomical observations. He used 
his family’s wealth to found an observatory that corrected nearly every 
astronomical record of the time, including those in Ptolemy’s Almagest.
Using Brahe’s measurements, his assistant Johannes Kepler was able to 
create rules governing the motion of the planets in our solar system. In his 
three laws of planetary motion, Kepler realized that the planetary orbits were 
elliptical rather than circular.
	
More importantly, Kepler discovered that the motion of the planets wasn’t 
uniform. A planet’s speed changes as it moves along its elliptical path. Kepler 
showed that the heavens were a dynamic system, a detail that later helped 
Newton show that the sun constantly influences the planets’ motion.
Galileo, by using the telescope, later realized that other planets had moons 
and determined that the heavens weren’t static. The Catholic Church 
charged him with heresy. To get away with only house arrest, Galileo was 
forced to recant his observations about the movements of heavenly bodies. 
Reportedly, his final words on his death bed were, “But they do move!” (Some 
versions of this story indicate that he uttered this statement upon being 
sentenced, so it may be a myth.)
Galileo’s work, together with Kepler’s, laid the foundation for Isaac Newton’s 
law of gravity. With gravity introduced, the final nail had been placed in the 
scientific consensus behind the geosynchronous view. Astronomers and 
physicists now knew that Earth circled the sun, as the heliocentric model 
described. (The Catholic Church officially endorsed the heliocentric view in 
the 19th century. In 1992, Pope John Paul II officially apologized for Galileo’s 
treatment.)

143
 Chapter 9: Physics in Space: Considering Cosmology and Astrophysics
Introducing the Idea of 
an Expanding Universe
Even two centuries after Newton, Albert Einstein was strongly influenced 
by the concept of an unchanging universe. His general theory of relativity 
predicted a dynamic universe — one that changed substantially over time — 
so he introduced a term, called the cosmological constant, into the theory to 
make the universe static and eternal. This would prove to be a mistake when, 
several years later, astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe 
was expanding! Even today, the consequence of the cosmological constant 
in general relativity has enormous impact upon physics, causing string 
theorists to rethink their whole approach.
The equations of general relativity that Einstein developed showed that the 
very fabric of space was expanding or contracting. This made no sense to 
Einstein, so in 1917 he added the cosmological constant to the equations. 
This term represented a form of repulsive gravity that exactly balanced out 
the attractive pull of gravity.
When Hubble showed that the universe was indeed expanding, Einstein 
called the introduction of the cosmological constant his “biggest blunder” 
and removed it from the equations. This concept would return over the 
years, however, as you see in the “Dark Energy: Pushing the Universe Apart” 
section later in this chapter. With the discovery of dark energy, Einstein’s 
“blunder” was found to be a necessary parameter in the theory (even though 
physicists for most of a century assumed the cosmological constant’s value 
was zero).
Discovering that energy and 
pressure have gravity
In Newton’s gravity, bodies with mass were attracted to each other. 
Einstein’s relativity showed that mass and energy were related. Therefore, 
mass and energy both exerted gravitational influence. Not only that, but 
it was possible that space itself could exert a pressure that warped space. 
Several models were constructed to show how this energy and pressure 
affected the expansion and contraction of space.
When Einstein created his first model based on the general theory of 
relativity, he realized that it implied an expanding universe. At the time, 
no one had any particular reason to think the universe was expanding, and 
Einstein assumed that this was a flaw in his theory.

144
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Einstein’s general relativity equations allowed for the addition of an extra 
term while remaining mathematically viable. Einstein found that this term 
could represent a positive energy (or negative pressure) uniformly distributed 
throughout the fabric of space-time itself, which would act as an antigravity, 
or repulsive form of gravity. This term was chosen to precisely cancel out the 
contraction of the universe, so the universe would be static (or unchanging 
in time).
In 1917, the same year Einstein published his equations containing the 
cosmological constant, Dutch physicist Willem de Sitter applied them to a 
universe without matter. (As I explain in Chapter 4, this is a frequent step in 
scientific analysis — you strip a scientific theory of all the complications and 
consider it in the simplest cases.)
	
In this de Sitter space, the only thing that exists is the energy of the vacuum — 
the cosmological constant itself. Even in a universe containing no matter at all, 
this means that space will expand. A de Sitter space has a positive value for 
the cosmological constant, which can also be described as a positive curvature 
of space-time. A similar model with a negative cosmological constant (or a 
negative curvature, in which expansion is slowing) is called an anti-de Sitter 
space. (More on the curvature of space-time in a bit.)
In 1922, the Russian physicist Aleksandr Friedmann turned his hand to 
solving the elaborate equations of general relativity, but decided to do so in 
the most general case by applying the cosmological principle (which can be 
seen as a more general case of the Copernican principle), which consists of 
two assumptions:
	
✓	The universe looks the same in all directions (it’s isotropic).
	
✓	The universe is uniform no matter where you go (it’s homogenous).
With these assumptions, the equations become much simpler. Einstein’s 
original model and de Sitter’s model both ended up being special cases 
of this more general analysis. Friedmann was able to define the solution 
depending on just three parameters:
	
✓	Hubble’s constant (the rate of expansion of the universe)
	
✓	Lambda (the cosmological constant)
	
✓	Omega (average matter density in the universe)
	
To this day, scientists are trying to determine these values as precisely as 
they can, but even without real values they can define three possible solutions. 
Each solution matches a certain “geometry” of space, which can be represented 
in a simplified way by the way space naturally curves in the universe, as 
shown in Figure 9-2.

145
 Chapter 9: Physics in Space: Considering Cosmology and Astrophysics
	
✓	Closed universe: There is enough matter in the universe that gravity 
will eventually overcome the expansion of space. The geometry of such 
a universe is a positive curvature, such as the sphere in the leftmost 
image in Figure 9-2. (This matched Einstein’s original model without a 
cosmological constant.)
	
✓	Open universe: There isn’t enough matter to stop expansion, so the 
universe will continue to expand forever at the same rate. This space-
time has a negative curvature, like the saddle shape shown in the middle 
image in Figure 9-2.
	
✓	Flat universe: The expansion of the universe and the density of matter 
perfectly balance out, so the universe’s expansion slows down over time 
but never quite stops completely. This space has no overall curvature, 
as shown in the rightmost image of Figure 9-2. (Friedmann himself didn’t 
discover this solution; it was found years later.)
	
Figure 9-2: 
Three 
types of 
universes: 
closed, 
open, and 
flat.
	
These models are highly simplified, but they needed to be because Einstein’s 
equations got very complex in cases where the universe was populated with 
a lot of matter, and supercomputers didn’t yet exist to perform all the math 
(and even physicists want to go on dates every once in a while).
Hubble drives it home
In 1927, astronomer Edwin Hubble proved that the universe is expanding. 
With this new evidence, Einstein removed the cosmological constant from his 
equations.
Edwin Hubble had shown in 1925 that there were galaxies outside our own. 
Until that time, astronomers had observed white blobs of stars in the sky, 
which they called nebulae, but the astronomers disagreed about how far 
away they were. In his work at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California, 
Hubble proved that these were, in fact, distant galaxies.

146
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
While studying these distant galaxies, he noticed that the light from these 
distant stars had a wavelength that was shifted slightly toward the red end of 
the electromagnetic spectrum, compared to what he expected.
This is a consequence of the wave nature of light — an object that’s moving 
(with respect to the observer) emits light with a slightly different wavelength. 
This is based on the Doppler effect, which is what happens to the wavelength 
of sound waves from a moving source. If you’ve ever heard a siren’s pitch 
change as it approaches and passes you, you’ve experienced the Doppler 
effect.
In a similar way, when a light source is moving, the wavelength of the light 
changes. A redshift in light from a star means the star is moving away from 
the observer.
	
Hubble saw this redshift in the stars he observed, caused not only by the 
motion of the stars but by the expansion of space-time itself, and in 1929 
determined that the amount of shift was related to the distance from Earth. 
The more distant stars were moving away faster than the nearby stars. Space 
itself was expanding.
Clearly, in this case, Einstein had been wrong and Friedmann had been 
right to explore all the possible scenarios predicted by general relativity. 
(Unfortunately, Friedmann died in 1925, so he never knew he was right.)
Finding a Beginning: 
The Big Bang Theory
It soon became evident that an expanding universe was once very much 
smaller — so small, in fact, that it was compressed down to a single point (or, 
at least, a very small area). The theory that the universe started from such 
a primordial point and has expanded ever since is known as the big bang 
theory. The theory was first proposed in 1927, but was controversial until 
1965, when an accidental discovery supported the theory. Today, the most 
advanced astronomical observations show that the big bang theory is likely 
true. String theory will hopefully help physicists understand more precisely 
what happened in those early moments of the universe, so understanding the 
big bang theory is a key component of string theory’s cosmological work.
The man originally responsible for the big bang theory was a Belgian priest 
and physicist, Georges Lemaître, who independently worked on theories 
similar to Friedmann’s. Like Friedmann, Lemaître realized that the universe 
defined by general relativity would either expand or contract.

147
 Chapter 9: Physics in Space: Considering Cosmology and Astrophysics
In 1927, Lemaître learned of Hubble’s finding about distant galaxies moving 
away from Earth. He realized that this meant space was expanding, and 
he published a theory that came to be called the big bang theory. (See the 
nearby sidebar, “What’s in a name?”)
	
Because you know that space is expanding, you can run the video of the 
universe backward in time in your head (rewind it, so to speak). When you do 
this, you realize that the universe had to be much smaller than it is now. As 
the matter in the universe gets compressed into a smaller and smaller amount 
of space, the laws of thermodynamics (which govern the flow of heat) tell you 
that the matter had to be incredibly hot and dense.
The big bang theory reveals that the universe came from a state of dense, 
hot matter, but it tells nothing about how the matter got there, or whether 
anything else existed before the big bang (or even if the word “before” has 
any meaning when you’re talking about the beginning of time). I explore these 
speculative topics in Chapters 14 and 15.
Bucking the big bang: 
The steady state theory
In opposition to the big bang theory, Fred Hoyle proposed an alternative 
theory, called the steady state theory. In this theory, new particles were 
continually being created. As space expanded, these new particles were 
created fast enough that the overall mass density of the universe remained 
constant.
	
To understand the reason for such a theory, you have to realize that few 
physicists thought it likely that a dense ball of matter could spring into 
existence out of nowhere, violating the law of conservation of mass (or 
conservation of mass-energy). That matter had to come from somewhere.
What’s in a name?
The name “big bang” was given to the theory 
by Fred Hoyle, one of the theory’s greatest 
critics. In a 1949 series of BBC radio broadcasts, 
Hoyle was speaking dismissively of the idea 
that everything in the universe was created in 
one sudden “big bang” in the distant past.
The name stuck, much to big bang theorists’ 
dismay. Strictly speaking, the big bang theory 
doesn’t include a bang. Rather, the theory 
states that a tiny primordial particle began to 
expand, creating the universe. There is neither 
big nor bang in this theory.

148
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
In Hoyle’s view, if matter could be created out of nothing one time, then why 
not have it happen all the time?
Though Hoyle’s steady state theory would ultimately fail, in trying to prove 
it Hoyle would prove himself worthy in the eyes of history by developing 
a theory about where the dense atoms of our universe come from (which I 
cover in the later section “Understanding where the chemical elements came 
from”).
Going to bat for the big bang: Cosmic 
microwave background radiation
One of the major converts to the big bang theory was physicist George 
Gamow, who realized that if the theory were true, a residual trace of cosmic 
microwave background radiation (CMBR) would be spread throughout the 
universe. Attempts to find this radiation failed for many years, until an 
unexpected problem in 1965 accidentally detected it.
Gamow is known to many as the author of a number of popular books on 
science, but he was also a theoretician and experimentalist who liked to 
throw out ideas right and left, seemingly not caring whether they bore fruit.
Turning his attention to cosmology and the big bang, Gamow noted in 1948 
that this dense ball of matter (probably neutrons, he hypothesized) would 
emit black body radiation, which had been worked out in 1900 by Max 
Planck. A black body emits radiation at a definable wavelength based on the 
temperature.
Gamow’s two students, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, published a paper 
in 1948 with the calculation for the temperature, and therefore the radiation, of 
this original ball of matter. The men calculated the temperature to be about 
5 degrees above absolute zero, although it took nearly a year for Gamow to 
agree with this calculation. This radiation is in the microwave range of the 
electromagnetic spectrum, so it’s called the cosmic microwave background 
radiation (CMBR).
Although this was a successful theoretical breakthrough, it went largely 
unnoticed at the time. Nobody conducted a serious experiment to look for 
this radiation, even while Gamow, Alpher, and Herman tried to gain support.
In 1965, a Princeton University team led by Robert Dicke had independently 
developed the theory and was attempting to test it. Dicke’s team failed to 
discover the CMBR, however, because while they were putting the finishing 
touches on their equipment, someone else beat them to it.

149
 Chapter 9: Physics in Space: Considering Cosmology and Astrophysics
A few miles away, at New Jersey’s Bell Laboratory Holmdell Horn Radio 
Telescope, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were having trouble of their 
own. Their telescope — which was more sophisticated than Princeton 
University’s — was picking up this horrible static when they attempted to 
detect radio signals in space. No matter where they pointed the silly thing, 
they kept getting the same static. The two men even cleaned bird droppings 
off the telescope, but to no avail. In fact, the static got worse on the 
unobstructed telescope.
Fortunately, Penzias and Dicke had a mutual friend in astronomer Bernard 
Burke, and upon discovering the problems the two men had, he introduced 
them. Penzias and Wilson earned the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for 
accidentally discovering the CMBR (at a temperature of 2.7 degrees above 
absolute zero — Gamow’s calculations had been slightly high).
Forty more years of research has only confirmed the big bang theory, most 
recently in the picture of the CMBR obtained by the Wilkinson Microwave 
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellite. The picture obtained by this satellite, 
shown in Figure 9-3, is like a baby picture of the universe when it was just 
380,000 years old (13.7 billion years ago). Before this, the universe was dense 
enough to be opaque, so no light can be used to look further back than that.

Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Understanding where the chemical 
elements came from
Both George Gamow and Fred Hoyle, while differing strongly on the big 
bang theory, were the key figures in determining the process of stellar 
nucleosynthesis, in which atoms are made inside of stars. Gamow theorized 
that elements were created by the heat of the big bang. Hoyle showed that 
the heavier elements were actually created by the intense heat of stars and 
supernovas.
Gamow’s original theory was that as the intense heat of the expanding 
universe cooled, the lightest element, hydrogen, was formed. The energy at 
this time was still enough to cause hydrogen molecules to interact, perhaps 
fusing into helium atoms. Estimates show that nearly 75 percent of the 
visible universe is made up of hydrogen and 25 percent is helium, with the 
rest of the elements on the periodic table making up only trace amounts on 
the scale of the entire universe.
This proved to be good, because Gamow couldn’t figure out how to cook up 
many of those heavier elements in the big bang. Hoyle tackled the problem, 
assuming that if he could make all the elements in stars, then the big bang 
theory would fail. Hoyle’s work on stellar nucleosynthesis was published in 
1957.
In Hoyle’s nucleosynthesis method, helium and hydrogen gather inside of 
stars and undergo nuclear fusion. Even this, however, isn’t hot enough to 
make atoms more massive than iron. These heavier elements — zinc, copper, 
uranium, and many others — are created when massive stars go through 
their deaths and explode in giant supernovas. These supernovas produce 
enough energy to fuse the protons together into the heavy atomic nucleus.
The elements are then blown out into space by the supernova blast, drifting 
as clouds of stellar dust. Some of this stellar dust eventually falls together 
under the influence of gravity to form planets, such as our Earth.
Using Inflation to Solve the Universe’s 
Problems of Flatness and Horizon
In trying to understand the universe, two major problems remained: the 
flatness problem and the horizon problem. To solve these two problems, the 
big bang theory is modified by the inflation theory, which states that the 
universe expanded rapidly shortly after it was created. Today, the principles 
at the heart of inflation theory have a profound impact on the way that string 
theory is viewed by many physicists, as becomes clear in Chapter 14.

151
 Chapter 9: Physics in Space: Considering Cosmology and Astrophysics
	
These two problems can be stated simply as:
	
✓	Horizon problem: The CMBR is essentially the same temperature in all 
directions.
	
✓	Flatness problem: The universe appears to have a flat geometry.
The universe’s issues: Too far and too flat
The horizon problem (also sometimes called the homogeneity problem) is 
that no matter which direction you look in the universe, you see basically the 
same thing (see Figure 9-3). The CMBR temperatures throughout the universe 
are, to a very high level of measurement, almost exactly the same temperature 
in every direction. This really shouldn’t be the case, if you think about it 
more carefully.
If you look in one direction in space, you’re actually looking back in time. 
The light that hits your eye (or telescope) travels at the speed of light, so it 
was emitted years ago. This means there’s a boundary of 14 billion (or so) 
light-years in all directions. (The boundary is actually farther because space 
itself is expanding, but you can ignore that for the purposes of this example.) 
If there is anything farther away than that, there is no way for it to have ever 
communicated with us. So you look out with your powerful telescope and can 
see the CMBR from 14 billion light-years away (call this Point A).
If you now look 14 billion light-years in the opposite direction (call this Point 
B), you see exactly the same sort of CMBR in that direction. Normally, you’d 
take this to mean that all the CMBR in the universe has somehow diffused 
throughout the universe, like heating up an oven. Somehow, the thermal 
information is communicated between Points A and B.
	
But Points A and B are 28 billion light-years apart, which means, because no 
signal can go faster than the speed of light, there’s no way they could have 
communicated with each other in the entire age of the universe. How did they 
become the same temperature if there’s no way for heat to transfer between 
them? This is the horizon problem.
The flatness problem has to do with the geometry of our universe, which 
appears (especially with recent WMAP evidence) to be a flat geometry, as 
pictured in Figure 9-2. The matter density and expansion rate of the universe 
appear to be nearly perfectly balanced, even 14 billion years later when 
minor variations should have grown drastically. Because this hasn’t happened, 
physicists need an explanation for why the minor variations haven’t 
increased dramatically. Did the variations not exist? Did they not grow into 
large-scale variations? Did something happen to smooth them out? The 
flatness problem seeks a reason why the universe has such a seemingly 
perfectly flat geometry.

152
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Rapid expansion early on 
holds the solutions
In 1980, astrophysicist Alan Guth proposed the inflation theory to solve 
the horizon and flatness problems (although later refinements by Andrei 
Linde, Andreas Albrecht, Paul Steinhardt, and others were required to get it 
to work). In this model, the early universal expansion accelerated at a rate 
much faster than we see today.
It turns out that the inflationary theory solves both the flatness problem 
and horizon problem (at least to the satisfaction of most cosmologists and 
astrophysicists). The horizon problem is solved because the different regions 
we see used to be close enough to communicate, but during inflation, space 
expanded so rapidly that these close regions were spread out to cover all of 
the visible universe.
	
The flatness problem is resolved because the act of inflation actually flattens 
the universe. Picture an uninflated balloon, which can have all kinds of 
wrinkles and other abnormalities. As the balloon expands, though, the surface 
smoothes out. According to inflation theory, this happens to the fabric of the 
universe as well.
In addition to solving the horizon and flatness problems, inflation also 
provides the seeds for the structure that we see in our universe today. 
Tiny energy variations during inflation, due simply to quantum uncertainty, 
become the sources for matter to clump together, eventually becoming 
galaxies and clusters of galaxies.
One issue with the inflationary theory is that the exact mechanism that 
would cause — and then turn off — the inflationary period isn’t known. 
Many technical aspects of inflationary theory remain unanswered, though 
the models include a scalar field called an inflaton field and a corresponding 
theoretical particle called an inflaton. Most cosmologists today believe that 
some form of inflation likely took place in the early universe.
Some variations and alternatives to this model are posed by string theorists 
and other physicists. Two creators of inflation theory, Andreas Albrecht and 
Paul J. Steinhart, have worked on alternative theories as well; see Chapter 14 
for Steinhart’s ekpyrotic theory and Chapter 19 for Albrecht’s variable speed 
of light cosmology.

Dark Matter: The Source of Extra Gravity
Astronomers have discovered that the gravitational effects observed in 
our universe don’t match the amount of matter seen. To account for these 
differences, it appears that the universe contains a mysterious form of matter 
that we can’t observe, called dark matter. Throughout the universe, there’s 
approximately six times as much dark matter as normal visible matter — and 
string theory may explain where it comes from!
In the 1930s, Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky first observed that some galaxies 
were spinning so fast that the stars in them should fly away from each other. 
Unfortunately, Zwicky had personality clashes with many in the astronomy 
community, so his views weren’t taken very seriously.
In 1962, astronomer Vera Rubin made the same discoveries and had nearly 
the same outcome. Though Rubin didn’t have the same issues of temperament 
that Zwicky did, many disregarded her work because she was a woman.
Rubin maintained her focus on the problem and, by 1978, had studied 11 
spiral galaxies, all of which (including our own Milky Way) were spinning so 
fast that the laws of physics said they should fly apart. Together with work 
from others, this was enough to convince the astronomy community that 
something strange was happening.
Whatever is holding these galaxies together, observations now indicate that 
there has to be far more of it than there is the visible matter that makes up 
the baryonic matter that we’re used to — the matter that comprises you, this 
book, this planet, and the stars.
Physicists have made several suggestions about what could make up this 
dark matter, but so far no one knows for sure. String theorists have some 
ideas, which you can read about in Chapter 14.
Dark Energy: Pushing the Universe Apart
Einstein’s cosmological constant allowed for a uniform repulsive energy 
throughout the universe. Since Hubble discovered the expansion of the 
universe, most scientists have believed that the cosmological constant was 

154
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
zero (or possibly slightly negative). Recent findings have indicated that the 
expansion rate of the universe is actually increasing, meaning that the 
cosmological constant has a positive value. This repulsive gravity — or dark 
energy — is actually pushing the universe apart. This is one major feature of 
the universe that string theory may be able to explain.
In 1998, two teams of astronomers announced the same results: Studies of 
distant supernovas (exploding stars) showed that stars looked dimmer than 
expected. The only way to account for this was if the stars were somehow 
farther away than expected, but the physicists had already accounted for the 
expansion of the universe. The explanation eventually found was startling: 
The rate of expansion of the universe was accelerating.
To explain this, physicists realized that there had to be some sort of repulsive 
gravity that worked on large scales (see Figure 9-4). On small scales, normal 
gravity rules, but on larger scales the repulsive gravity force of dark energy 
seemed to take over. (This doesn’t contradict the idea that the universe is 
flat — but it makes the fact that it is flat, while still expanding, a very unusual 
and unexpected set of circumstances, which required very narrow parameters 
on the early conditions of our universe.)

Repulsive gravity is theorized by inflation theory, but that’s a rapid hyper-
expansion in the early phases of the universe. Today’s expansion due to dark 
energy may be remnants of the repulsive gravity from inflation, or it may be an 
entirely distinct phenomenon.
The finding of dark energy (or a positive cosmological constant, which it is 
roughly similar to) creates major theoretical hurdles, especially considering 
how weak dark energy is. For years, quantum field theory predicted a huge 
cosmological constant, but most physicists assumed that some property 

155
 Chapter 9: Physics in Space: Considering Cosmology and Astrophysics
(such as supersymmetry, which does reduce the cosmological constant 
value) canceled it out to zero. Instead, the value is non-zero, but differs from 
theoretical predictions by nearly 120 decimal places! (You can find a more 
detailed explanation of this discrepancy in Chapter 14.)
In fact, results from the WMAP show that the vast majority of material in our 
present universe — about 73 percent — is made up of dark energy (remember 
from relativity that matter and energy are different forms of the same thing: 
E = mc2, after all). The five-year WMAP data, released in 2008 and shown in 
Figure 9-5, also allows you to compare the composition of the present 
universe with the material present in the universe 13.7 billion years ago. The 
dark energy was a vanishingly small slice of the pie 13.7 billion years ago, but 
today it eclipses matter and drives the universe’s expansion.

The history of the universe is a fascinating topic for study, and trying to 
understand the meaning of this dark energy is one of the key aspects of 
modern cosmology. It’s also one of the key challenges to modern variations 
of string theory, as you see in Chapter 11.
Today, many string theorists devote attention to these cosmological 
mysteries of the universe’s origins and evolution because they provide a 
universal playground on which the ideas of string theory can be explored, 
potentially at energy levels where string behavior may manifest itself. In 
Chapters 12, 14, and 15, you discover what behaviors these string theorists 
might be looking for and what the implications are for the universe.
Stretching the Fabric of Space-Time 
into a Black Hole

156
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
One of the consequences of Einstein’s general theory of relativity was a 
solution in which space-time curved so much that even a beam of light 
became trapped. These solutions became called black holes, and the study of 
them is one of the most intriguing fields of cosmology. Application of string 
theory to study black holes is one of the most significant pieces of evidence 
in favor of string theory.
Black holes are believed to form when stars die and their massive bulk 
collapses inward, creating intense gravitational fields. No one has “seen” a 
black hole, but scientists have observed gravitational evidence consistent 
with predictions about them, so most scientists believe they exist.
What goes on inside a black hole?
According to the general theory of relativity, it’s possible that the very fabric 
of space-time bends an infinite amount. A point with this infinite curvature is 
called a space-time singularity. If you follow space-time back to the big bang, 
you’d reach a singularity. Singularities also exist inside of black holes, as 
shown in Figure 9-6.
	
Figure 9-6: 
Inside a 
black hole, 
space-time 
stretches to 
an infinite 
singularity.
	
Because general relativity says that the curvature of space-time is equivalent 
to the force of gravity, the singularity of a black hole has infinite gravity. 
Any matter going into a black hole would be ripped apart by this intense 
gravitational energy as it neared the singularity.
For this reason, black holes provide an excellent theoretical testing ground 
for string theory. Gravity is normally so weak that quantum effects aren’t 
observed, but inside of a black hole, gravity becomes the dominant force 
at work. A theory of quantum gravity, such as string theory, would explain 
exactly what happens inside a black hole.

157
 Chapter 9: Physics in Space: Considering Cosmology and Astrophysics
What goes on at the edge of a black hole?
The edge of a black hole is called the event horizon, and it represents a 
barrier that even light can’t come out of. If you were to go near the edge of 
a black hole, relativistic effects take place, including time dilation. To an 
outside observer, it would look like time was slowing down for you, eventually 
coming to a stop. (You, on the other hand, would notice nothing — until the 
black hole’s intense gravitational forces squished you, of course.)
It was previously believed that things only get sucked into a black hole, but 
physicist Stephen Hawking famously showed that black holes emit an energy 
called Hawking radiation. (This was proposed in 1974, a year after the equally 
groundbreaking realization by Israeli Jacob Bekenstein that black holes 
possessed entropy — a thermodynamic measure of disorder in a system. 
The entropy measures the number of different ways to arrange things in a 
system.)
	
Quantum physics predicts that virtual particles are continually created and 
destroyed, due to quantum fluctuations of energy in the vacuum. Hawking 
applied this concept to black holes and realized that if such a pair is created 
near the event horizon, it was possible for one of the particles to get pulled 
into the black hole while the other one didn’t. This would look identical to the 
black hole emitting radiation. To preserve energy, the particle that fell into the 
black hole must have negative energy and reduce the overall energy (or mass) 
of the black hole.
The behavior of black holes is curious in a number of ways, many of them 
demonstrated by Hawking in the 1970s:
	
✓	A black hole’s entropy is proportional to the surface area of the black 
hole (the area of the event horizon), unlike conventional systems where 
entropy is proportional to volume. This was Bekenstein’s discovery.
	
✓	If you put more matter into a black hole, it cools down.
	
✓	As a black hole emits Hawking radiation, the energy comes from the 
black hole, so it loses mass. This means the black hole heats up, losing 
energy (and therefore mass) more quickly.
	
In other words, Stephen Hawking showed in the mid-1970s that a black hole 
will evaporate (unless it is “fed” more mass than it loses in energy). He did this 
by applying principles of quantum physics to a problem of gravity. After the 
black hole evaporates down to the size of the Planck length, a quantum theory 
of gravity is needed to explain what happens to it.

158
Part II: The Physics Upon Which String Theory Is Built 
Hawking’s solution is that the black hole evaporates at that point, emitting a 
final burst of random energy. This solution results in the so-called black hole 
information paradox, because quantum mechanics doesn’t allow information 
to be lost, but the energy from the evaporation doesn’t seem to carry the 
information about the matter that originally went into the black hole. I 
discuss this black hole information paradox and its potential resolutions in 
greater detail in Chapter 14.

of Everything

In this part . . .
S
tring theory has existed for nearly four decades. It’s 
one of the most unusual scientific theories of all time 
because it has developed backwards. It began as a theory 
of particle interactions and failed at that (only to later 
incorporate the theory that replaced it). It then became a 
theory of quantum gravity, but made predictions that 
didn’t seem to match reality.
Today string theory has become so complex and has 
yielded so many unexpected results that its proponents 
have begun citing this flexibility within the theory as one 
of its greatest strengths.
This part explains how string theory got its start and how 
it has transformed over the years. I explain the basic 
interpretations of key concepts, as well as the ways in 
which string theorists have been able to adapt to new 
findings. Finally, I look at some ways that scientists might 
be able to prove — or disprove — string theory.

A
 year before astronauts set foot on the moon, no one had ever heard of 
string theory. The concepts at the core of the theory were being neither 
discussed nor debated. Physicists struggled to complete the Standard Model 
of particle physics, but had abandoned the hopes of a theory of everything 
(if they ever had any such hope in the first place).
In other words, no one was looking for strings when physicists found them.
In this chapter, I tell you about the early beginnings of string theory, which 
quickly failed to do anything the creators expected (or wanted) it to do. 
Then I explain how, from these humble beginnings, several elements of string 
theory began to spring up, which drew more and more scientists to pursue it.
Bosonic String Theory: 
The First String Theory
The first string theory has become known as bosonic string theory, and it said 
that all the particles that physicists have observed are actually the vibration 
of multidimensional “strings.” But the theory had consequences that made it 
unrealistic to use to describe our reality.

162
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
A dedicated group of physicists worked on bosonic string theory between 
1968 and the early 1970s, when the development of superstring theory 
(which said the same thing, but fit reality better) supplanted it. (I explain 
this superior theory in the later section “Supersymmetry Saves the Day: 
Superstring Theory.”)
Even though bosonic string theory was flawed and incomplete, string 
theorists occasionally do mathematical work with this model to test new 
methods and theories before moving on to the more modern superstring 
models.
Explaining the scattering of particles 
with early dual resonance models
String theory was born in 1968 as an attempt to explain the scattering of 
particles (specifically hadrons, like protons and neutrons) within a particle 
accelerator. Originally, it had nothing to do with strings. These early 
predecessors of string theory were known as dual resonance models.
The initial and final state of particle interactions can be recorded in an array 
of numbers called an S-matrix. At the time, finding a mathematical structure 
for this S-matrix was considered to be a significant step toward creating a 
coherent model of particle physics.
Gabriele Veneziano, a physicist at the CERN particle accelerator laboratory, 
realized that an existing mathematical formula seemed to explain the 
mathematical structure of the S-matrix. (See the sidebar “Applications of 
pure mathematics to physics” for more on this formula.) (Physicist Michio 
Kaku has stated that Mahiko Suzuki, also at CERN, made the same discovery 
at the same time, but was persuaded by a mentor not to publish it.)
Veneziano’s explanation has been called the dual resonance model, the 
Veneziano amplitude, or just the Veneziano model. The dual resonance model 
was close to the correct result for how hadrons interacted, but not quite 
correct. At the time Veneziano developed the model, particle accelerators 
weren’t precise enough to detect the differences between model and reality. 
(Eventually, it would be shown that the alternative theory of quantum 
chromodynamics was the correct explanation of hadron behavior, as 
discussed in Chapter 8.)

163
 Chapter 10: Early Strings and Superstrings: Unearthing the Theory’s Beginnings
After the dual resonance model was formed, hundreds of theoretical papers 
were published in attempts to modify the parameters a bit. This was the way 
theories were approached in physics; after all, an initial guess at a theory is 
rarely precisely correct and typically requires subtle tweaks — to see how 
the theory reacts, how much it can be bent and modified, and so on — so 
that ultimately it fits with the experimental results.
The dual resonance model would have nothing to do with that sort of 
tinkering — it simply didn’t allow for any changes that would still enable it 
to be valid. The mathematical parameters of the theory were too precisely 
fixed. Attempts to modify the theory in any way quickly led to a collapse of 
the entire theory. Like a dagger balanced on its tip, any slight disturbance 
would send it toppling over. Mathematically, it was locked into a certain set 
of values. In fact, it has been said by some that the theory had absolutely no 
adjustable parameters — at least not until it was transformed into an entirely 
different concept: superstring theory!
This isn’t the way theories are supposed to behave. If you have a theory 
and modify it so the particle mass, for example, changes a bit, the theory 
shouldn’t collapse — it should just give you a different result.
Applications of pure mathematics to physics
Physicists frequently find the math they need was 
created long before it was needed. For example, 
the equation that physicist Gabriele Veneziano 
used to explain particle scattering was the 
Euler beta function, which was discovered 
in the 1700s by Swiss mathematician Leonhard 
Euler. Also, when Einstein began to extend 
special relativity into general relativity, he soon 
realized that traditional Euclidean geometry 
wouldn’t work. His space had to curve, and 
Euclid’s geometry only described flat surfaces.
Fortunately for Einstein, in the mid-1800s the 
German mathematician Bernhard Riemann had 
worked on a form of non-Euclidean geometry 
(named Riemannian geometry). The mathematics 
that Einstein needed for the general theory 
of relativity had been created a half century 
earlier as an intellectual exercise, with no 
practical purpose in mind. (As fascinating as 
revolutionizing the foundations of geometry 
may be, it was hardly practical.)
This happened several times in the history of 
string theory. Calabi-Yau manifolds, discussed 
at the end of this chapter, are one example. 
Another example is when string theorists 
were attempting to determine the appropriate 
number of dimensions to make their theories 
stable and consistent. A key to this problem 
came from the journals of Indian mathematical 
genius Srinivasa Ramanujan (referenced in 
the film Good Will Hunting), who died in 1920. 
The specific mathematics in this case was a 
function called the Ramanujan function.

164
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
When a theory can’t be modified, there are only two possible reasons: 
either it’s completely wrong or it’s completely right! For several years, dual 
resonance models looked like they might be completely right, so physicists 
continued to ponder what they might mean.
Exploring the first physical model: 
Particles as strings
The basic physical interpretation of string theory was as vibrating strings. 
As the strings, each representing a particle, collided with each other, the 
S-matrix described the result.
	
Consider this very informal way of looking at string theory, shown in Figure 
10-1. Each particle is composed of a vibrating string. In the case of a proton, 
there are three quark strings. When these three strings come in contact, they 
bond together to form a proton. So the proton is created by the interaction 
of the three quark strings touching each other. The proton is kind of a knot 
within the strings.

Most people 
think of 
particles 
as solid 
spheres. 
In string 
theory, 
scientists 
view them 
as vibrating 
strings 
instead.
	
What are these strings like? The strings described were almost like rubber 
bands. There is a certain “springiness” to them. A phrase that I think 
describes them well is “filaments of energy” (as string theorist Brian Greene 
and others have called them). Though most people think of particles as balls 
of matter, physicists have long thought of them as little bundles of waves 
(called wave packets), which is in line with describing them as strings. (In 
some other situations, physicists can treat particles as having no size 
whatsoever, but this is a simplification to make the math and theory more 
manageable. The way physicists treat particles depends a lot on the situation 
they’re working with.)

165
 Chapter 10: Early Strings and Superstrings: Unearthing the Theory’s Beginnings
This interpretation was put forth independently by Yoichiro Nambu, Holger 
Nielsen, and Leonard Susskind in 1970, earning all three men positions as 
founders of string theory.
According to Einstein’s work, mass was a form of energy, an insight 
demonstrated dramatically by the creation of the atomic bomb. Quantum 
theory showed physicists that matter was represented by the mathematics 
of wave mechanics, so even a particle had a wavelength associated with it.
In string theory, matter again takes on a new form. Particles of different 
types are different vibrational modes of these fundamental entities: energetic 
rubber bands, or strings. (Classical vibrations and strings are discussed in 
Chapter 5.) In essence, the more the string vibrates, the more energy (and 
therefore mass) it possesses.
Through all the transformations that string theory has undergone in the 
years since its discovery, this central concept remains (fairly) constant, 
although in recent years new objects in addition to strings have been 
introduced (which I explain in Chapter 11 when I discuss branes).
	
The basic physical model couldn’t have been simpler: The particles and forces 
in nature are really interactions between vibrating strings of energy.
Bosonic string theory loses out 
to the Standard Model
The dual resonance model was created for the express purpose of 
explaining the S-matrix particle scattering, which was now explained in 
terms of the Standard Model of particle physics — gauge fields and 
quantum chromodynamics. (See Chapter 8 for more on these concepts.) 
There was no point to string theory in light of the success of the Standard 
Model.
Also, as the measurements of experiments in particle accelerators got more 
precise, it became clear that dual resonance models were only approximately 
correct. In 1969, physicists showed that Veneziano had discovered only 
the first term in an infinite series of terms. Although this term was the most 
important, it still wasn’t complete. The theory appeared to need some further 
refinement to match the results perfectly.
Terms could be added (which Michio Kaku did in 1972), correcting for the 
different ways that the strings could collide, but it made the theory less 
elegant. There were growing indications that string theory might not work 
the way everyone had thought it would and that, indeed, quantum 
chromodynamics explained the behavior of the particle collisions better.

166
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
The early string theorists had therefore spent a lot of time giving meaning to a 
theory that seemed to (almost) accurately predict the S-matrix, only to find that 
the majority of particle physicists weren’t interested in it. It had to be very 
frustrating to have such an elegant model that was quickly falling into obscurity.
But a few string theorists weren’t about to give up on it quite yet.
Why Bosonic String Theory Doesn’t 
Describe Our Universe
By 1974, bosonic string theory was quickly becoming a mathematical mess, 
and attempts to make the theory mathematically consistent caused more 
trouble for the model than it had already. Playing with the math introduced 
four conditions that should have, by all rights, spelled the end of the early 
string theory:
	
✓	Massless particles
	
✓	Tachyons, which move faster than the speed of light
	
✓	Fermions, such as electrons, can’t exist
	
✓	25 spatial dimensions
The cause of these problems was a reasonable constraint built into string 
theory. No matter what else string theory did, it needed to be consistent with 
existing physics — namely special relativity and quantum theory.
The Standard Model of particle physics was consistent with both theories 
(though it still had trouble reconciling with general relativity), so string 
theory also had to be consistent with both. If it violated a half century of 
established physics, there was no way it could be a viable theory.
Physicists eventually found ways to modify the theory to be consistent with 
these existing physical laws. Unfortunately, these modifications resulted in 
the four problematic features outlined in the bulleted list. It wasn’t just that 
these features were possible, but that they were now seemingly essential 
components of the theory.
Massless particles
One side effect of creating a consistent string theory is that it had to contain 
certain objects that can never be brought to rest. Because mass is a measure 
of an object while it’s at rest, these sorts of particles are called massless 
particles. This would be a major problem for string theory if the massless 
particles predicted didn’t really exist.

167
 Chapter 10: Early Strings and Superstrings: Unearthing the Theory’s Beginnings
Overall, though, this wasn’t a terribly disturbing problem because scientists 
know for certain that at least one particle exists only in a state of motion: 
the photon. (The gluon, though not known for certain at the time, is also a 
massless particle.)
Under the Standard Model of particle physics at the time, it was believed that 
a particle called the neutrino might have a mass of zero. (Today we know that 
the neutrino’s mass is slightly higher than zero.)
	
There was also one other possible massless particle: the graviton. The 
graviton is the theoretical gauge boson that could be responsible for the force 
of gravity under quantum field theory.
The existence of massless particles in string theory was unfortunate, but 
it was a surmountable problem. String theorists needed to uncover the 
properties of massless particles and prove that their properties were 
consistent with the known universe.
Tachyons
A bigger problem than massless particles was the tachyon, a particle predicted 
by bosonic string theory that travels faster than the speed of light. Under a 
consistent bosonic string theory, the mathematical formulas demanded 
that tachyons exist, but the presence of tachyons in a theory represents a 
fundamental instability in the theory. Solutions that contain tachyons will 
always decay into another, lower energy solution — possibly in a never-
ending cycle. For this reason, physicists don’t believe that tachyons really 
exist, even if a theory initially looks like it contains such particles.
	
Strictly speaking, Einstein’s theory of relativity doesn’t absolutely forbid an 
object from traveling faster than the speed of light. What it says is that it 
would require an infinite amount of energy for an object to accelerate to the 
speed of light. Therefore, in a sense, the tachyon would still be consistent with 
relativity, because it would always be moving faster than the speed of light 
(and wouldn’t ever have to accelerate to that speed).
Mathematically, when calculating a tachyon’s mass and energy using 
relativity, it would contain imaginary numbers. (An imaginary number is 
the square root of a negative number.)
This was exactly how string theory equations predicted the tachyon: They 
were consistent only if particles with imaginary mass existed. But what is 
imaginary mass? What is an imaginary energy? These physical impossibilities 
give rise to the problems with tachyons.
The presence of tachyons is in no way unique to bosonic string theory. For 
example, the Standard Model contains a certain vacuum in which the Higgs 
boson is actually a type of tachyon as well. In this case, the theory isn’t 

168
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
inconsistent; it just means that the solution that was applied wasn’t a stable 
solution. It’s like trying to place a ball at the top of a hill — any slight 
movement will cause the ball to roll into a nearby valley. Similarly, this 
tachyon solution decays into a stable solution without the tachyons.
Unfortunately, in the case of bosonic string theory, there was no clear way to 
figure out what happened during the decay, or even if the solution ended up 
in a stable solution after decaying into a lower energy state.
With all of these problems, physicists don’t view these tachyons as actual 
particles that exist, but rather as mathematical artifacts that fall out of the 
theory as a sign of certain types of inherent instabilities. Any solution that 
contains tachyons quickly decays due to these instabilities.
Some physicists (and science fiction authors) have explored notions of how 
to treat tachyons as actual particles, a speculative concept that will come up 
briefly in Chapter 16. But for now, just know that tachyons were one of the 
things that made physicists decide, at the time, that bosonic string theory 
was a failure.
No electrons allowed
The real flaw in bosonic string theory was the one that it’s named after. The 
theory predicted only the existence of bosons, not fermions. Photons could 
exist, but not quarks or electrons.
Every elementary particle observed in nature has a property called a spin, 
which is either an integer value (–1, 0, 1, 2, and so on) or a half-integer value 
(–1⁄2, 1⁄2, and so on). Particles with integer spins are bosons, and particles with 
half-integer spins are fermions. One key finding of particle physics is that all 
particles fall into one of these two categories.
For string theory to apply to the real world it had to include both types of 
particles, and the original formulation didn’t. The only particles allowed 
under the first model of string theory were bosons. This is why it would 
come to be known to physicists as the bosonic string theory.
25 space dimensions, plus 1 of time
Dimensions are the pieces of information needed to determine a precise point 
in space. (Dimensions are generally thought of in terms of up/down, left/
right, forward/backward.) In 1974, Claude Lovelace discovered that bosonic 
string theory could only be physically consistent if it were formulated in 25 
spatial dimensions (Chapter 13 delves into the idea of the additional dimensions 
in more depth), but so far as anyone knows, we only have three spatial 
dimensions!

169
 Chapter 10: Early Strings and Superstrings: Unearthing the Theory’s Beginnings
Relativity treats space and time as a continuum of coordinates, so this means 
that the universe has a total of 26 dimensions in string theory, as opposed 
to the four dimensions it possesses under Einstein’s special and general 
relativity theories.
It’s unusual that this requirement would be implicit in the theory. Einstein’s 
relativity has three spatial dimensions and one time dimension because 
those are the conditions used to create the theory. He didn’t begin working 
on relativity and just happen to stumble upon three spatial dimensions, but 
rather intentionally built it into the theory from the beginning. If he’d wanted 
a 2-dimensional or 5-dimensional relativity, he could have built the theory to 
work in those dimensions.
With bosonic string theory, the equations actually demanded a certain 
number of dimensions to be mathematically consistent. The theory falls 
apart in any other number of dimensions!
The reason for extra dimensions
	
The reason for these extra dimensions can be seen by analogy. Consider 
a long, loose spring (like a Slinky), which is flexible and elastic, similar to 
the strings of string theory. If you lay the spring in a straight line flat on the 
floor and pull it outward, waves move along the length of the spring. These 
are called longitudinal waves and are similar to the way sound waves move 
through the air.
The key thing is that these waves, or vibrations, move only back and forth 
along the length of the spring. In other words, they’re 1-dimensional waves.
Now imagine that the spring stays on the floor, but someone holds each end. 
Each person can move the ends of the spring anywhere they want, so long 
as it stays on the floor. They can move it left and right, or back and forth, or 
some combination of the two. As the ends of the spring move in this way, the 
waves that are generated require two dimensions to describe the motion.
Finally, imagine that each person has an end of the spring but can move it 
anywhere — left or right, back or forth, and up or down. The waves generated 
by the spring require three dimensions to explain the motion. Trying to use 
2-dimensional or 1-dimensional equations to explain the motion wouldn’t 
make sense.
In an analogous way, bosonic string theory required 25 spatial dimensions so 
the symmetries of the strings could be fully consistent. (Conformal symmetry 
is the exact name of the type of symmetry in string theory that requires this 
number of dimensions.) If the physicists left out any of those dimensions, it 
made about as much sense as trying to analyze the 3-dimensional spring in 
only one dimension . . . which is to say, none at all.

Dealing with the extra dimensions
The physical conception of these extra dimensions was (and still is) the 
hardest part of the theory to comprehend. Everyone can understand three 
spatial dimensions and a time dimension. Give me a latitude, longitude, 
altitude, and time, and I can meet you anywhere on the planet. You can 
measure height, width, and length, and you experience the passage of time, 
so you have a regular familiarity with what those dimensions represent.
What about the other 22 spatial dimensions? It was clear that these dimensions 
had to be hidden somehow. The Kaluza-Klein theory predicted that extra 
dimensions were rolled up, but rolling them up in precisely the right way to 
achieve results that made sense was difficult. This was achieved for string 
theory in the mid-1980s through the use of Calabi-Yau manifolds, as I discuss 
later in this chapter.
No one has any direct experience with these strange other dimensions. 
For the idea to come out of the symmetry relationships associated with a 
relatively obscure new theoretical physics conjecture certainly didn’t offer 
much motivation for physicists to accept it. And for more than a decade, 
most physicists didn’t.
Supersymmetry Saves the Day: 
Superstring Theory
Despite bosonic string theory’s apparent failures, some brave physicists 
stayed committed to their work. Why? Well, physicists can be a passionate 
bunch (nearly obsessive, some might say). Another reason was that by the 
time these problems were fully realized, many string theorists had already 
moved on from bosonic string theory anyway.
With the development of supersymmetry in 1971, which allows for bosons 
and fermions to coexist, string theorists were able to develop supersymmetric 
string theory, or, for short, superstring theory, which took care of the major 
problems that destroyed bosonic string theory. This work opened up whole 
new possibilities for string theory.
	
Almost every time you hear or read the phrase “string theory,” the person 
probably really means “superstring theory.” Since the discovery of 
supersymmetry, it has been applied to virtually all forms of string theory. 
The only string theory that really has nothing to do with supersymmetry 
is bosonic string theory, which was created before supersymmetry. For all 
practical discussion purposes (with anyone who isn’t a theoretical physicist), 
“string theory” and “superstring theory” are the same term.

171
 Chapter 10: Early Strings and Superstrings: Unearthing the Theory’s Beginnings
Fermions and bosons coexist . . . sort of
Symmetries exist throughout physics. A symmetry in physics is basically any 
situation where two properties can be swapped throughout the system and 
the results are precisely the same.
The notion of symmetry was picked up by Pierre Ramond in 1970, followed 
by the work of John Schwarz and Andre Neveu in 1971, to give hope to string 
theorists. Using two different techniques, they showed that bosonic string 
theory could be generalized in another way to obtain non-integer spins. Not 
only were the spins non-integer, but they were precisely half-integer spins, 
which characterize the fermion. No spin 1⁄4 particles showed up in the theory, 
which is good because they don’t exist in nature.
	
Including fermions into the model meant introducing a powerful new 
symmetry between fermions and bosons, called supersymmetry. 
Supersymmetry can be summarized as
	
✓	Every boson is related to a corresponding fermion.
	
✓	Every fermion is related to a corresponding boson.
In Chapter 11, I discuss the reasons to believe that supersymmetry is true, 
as well as ways that it can be proved. For now, it’s enough to know that it’s 
needed to make string theory work.
Who discovered supersymmetry?
The origins of supersymmetry are a bit 
confusing, because it was discovered around 
the same time by four separate groups.
In 1971, Russians Evgeny Likhtman and Yuri 
Golfand created a consistent theory containing 
supersymmetry. A year later, they were 
followed by two more Russians, Vladimir Akulov 
and Dmitri Volkov. These theories were in only 
two dimensions, however.
Due to the Cold War, communication between 
Russia and the non-communist world wasn’t 
very good, so many physicists didn’t hear about 
the Russian work. European physicists Julius 
Wess and Bruno Zumino were able to create a 
4-dimensional supersymmetric quantum theory 
in 1973, probably aware of the Russian work. 
Theirs was noticed by the Western physics 
community at large.
Then, of course, we have Pierre Ramond, John 
Schwarz, and Andre Neveu, who developed 
supersymmetry in 1970 and 1971, in the context 
of their superstring theories. It was only on 
later analysis that physicists realized their work 
and the later work hypothesized the same 
relationships.
Many physicists consider this repeated 
discovery as a good indication that there’s prob­
ably something to the idea of supersymmetry 
in nature, even if string theory itself doesn’t 
prove to be correct.

172
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Of course, as you’ll anticipate if you’re looking for trends in the story of 
string theory, things didn’t quite fall out right. Fermions and bosons have 
very different properties, so getting them to change places without affecting 
the possible outcomes of an experiment isn’t easy.
Physicists know about a number of bosons and fermions, but when they 
began looking at the properties of the theory, they found that the 
correspondence didn’t exist between known particles. A photon (which is a 
boson) doesn’t appear to be linked by supersymmetry with any of the known 
fermions.
Fortunately for theoretical physicists, this messy experimental fact was seen 
as only a minor obstacle. They turned to a method that has worked for 
theorists since the dawn of time. If you can’t find evidence of your theory, 
hypothesize it!
Double your particle fun: Supersymmetry 
hypothesizes superpartners
Under supersymmetry, the corresponding bosons and fermions are called 
superpartners. The superpartner of a standard particle is called a sparticle.
Because none of the existing particles are superpartners, this means that 
if supersymmetry is true, there are twice as many particles as we currently 
know about. For every standard particle, a sparticle that has never been 
detected experimentally must exist. The detection of sparticles will be one of 
the key pieces of evidence the Large Hadron Collider will look for.
	
If I mention a strangely named particle that you’ve never run into, it’s probably 
a sparticle. Because supersymmetry introduces so many new particles, it’s 
important to keep them straight. Physicists have introduced a Dr. Seuss-like 
naming convention to identify the hypothetical new particles:
	
✓	The superpartner of a fermion begins with an “s” before the standard 
particle name; so the superpartner of an “electron” is the “selectron,” 
and the superpartner of the “quark” is the “squark.”
	
✓	The superpartner of a boson ends in an “–ino,” so the superpartner of a 
“photon” is the “photino” and of the “graviton” is the “gravitino.”
Table 10-1 shows the names of standard particles and their corresponding 
superpartner.

Some problems get fixed, but the 
dimension problem remains
The introduction of supersymmetry into string theory helped with some of 
the major problems of bosonic string theory. Fermions now existed within 
the theory, which had been the biggest problem. Tachyons vanished from 
superstring theory. Massless particles were still present in the theory, but 
weren’t seen as a major issue. Even the dimensional problem improved, 
dropping from 26 space-time dimensions down to a mere ten.
The supersymmetry solution was elegant. Bosons — the photon, graviton, 
Z, and W bosons — are units of force. Fermions — the electron, quarks, and 
neutrinos — are units of matter. Supersymmetry created a new symmetry, 
one between matter and forces.
In 1972, Andre Neveu and Joel Scherk resolved the massless particle issue by 
showing that string vibrational states could correspond to the gauge bosons, 
such as the massless photon.

174
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
The dimensional problem remained, although it was better than it had been. 
Instead of 25 spatial dimensions, superstring theory became consistent with 
a “mere” nine spatial dimensions (plus one time dimension, for a total of ten 
dimensions). Many string theorists of the day believed this was still too many 
dimensions to work with, so they abandoned the theory for other lines of 
research.
One physicist who turned his back on string theory was Michio Kaku, one of 
today’s most vocal advocates of string theory. Kaku’s PhD thesis involved 
completing all the terms in the Veneziano model’s infinite series. He’d created 
a field theory of strings, so he was working in the thick of string theory. Still, 
he abandoned work on superstring theory, believing that there was no way it 
could be a valid theory. That’s how serious the dimensional problem was.
For the handful of people who remained dedicated to string theory after 1974, 
they faced serious issues about how to proceed. With the exception of the 
dimensional problem, they had resolved nearly all the issues with bosonic 
string theory by transforming it into superstring theory.
The only question was what to do with it.
Supersymmetry and Quantum 
Gravity in the Disco Era
By 1974, the Standard Model had become the theoretical explanation of 
particle physics and was being confirmed in experiment after experiment. 
With a stable foundation, theoretical physicists now looked for new worlds 
to conquer, and many decided to tackle the same problem that had vexed 
Albert Einstein for the last decades of his life: quantum gravity.
Also as a consequence of the Standard Model’s success, string theory wasn’t 
needed to explain particle physics. Instead, almost by accident, string 
theorists began to realize that string theory might just be the very theory 
that would solve the problem of quantum gravity.
The graviton is found hiding 
in string theory
The graviton is a particle that, under predictions from unified field theory, 
would mediate the gravitational force (see Chapter 2 for more on the 
graviton). In a very real sense, the graviton is the force of gravity. One 

175
 Chapter 10: Early Strings and Superstrings: Unearthing the Theory’s Beginnings
major finding of string theory was that it not only includes the graviton, but 
requires its existence as one of the massless particles discussed earlier in 
this chapter.
In 1974, Joel Scherk and John Schwarz demonstrated that a spin-2 massless 
particle in superstring theory could actually be the graviton. This particle 
was represented by a closed string (which formed a loop), as opposed to an 
open string, where the ends are loose. Both sorts of strings are demonstrated 
in Figure 10-2.
	
Figure 10-2: 
String the-
ory allows 
for open 
and closed 
strings. 
Open strings 
are optional, 
but closed 
strings have 
to exist.
	
Open strings
Closed strings
	
String theory demands that these closed strings must exist, though open 
strings may or may not exist. Some versions of string theory are perfectly 
mathematically consistent but contain only the closed strings. No theory 
contains only open strings, because if you have open strings, you can construct 
a situation where the ends of the strings meet each other and, voilà, a closed 
string exists. (Cutting closed strings to get open strings isn’t always allowed.)
From a theoretical standpoint, this was astounding (in a good way). Instead 
of trying to shoehorn gravity into the theory, the graviton fell out as a natural 
consequence. If superstring theory was the fundamental law of nature, then it 
required the existence of gravity in a way that no other proposed theory had 
ever done!
Immediately, it became clear to Schwarz and Scherk that they had a potential 
candidate for quantum gravity on their hands.
Even while everyone else was fleeing from the multiple dimensions their 
theory predicted, Scherk and Schwarz became more convinced than ever 
that they were on the right track.

176
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
The other supersymmetric gravity 
theory: Supergravity
Supergravity is the name for theories that attempt to apply supersymmetry 
directly to the theory of gravity without the use of string theory. Throughout 
the late 1970s, this work proceeded at a faster pace than string theory, 
mainly because it was popular while the string theory camp had become a 
ghost town. Supergravity theories prove important in the later development 
of M-theory, which I cover in Chapter 11.
In 1976, Daniel Freedman, Sergio Ferrara, and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen 
applied supersymmetry to Einstein’s theory of gravity, resulting in a theory 
of supergravity. They did this by introducing the superpartner of the 
graviton, the gravitino, into the theory of general relativity.
Building on this work, Eugene Cremmer, Joel Scherk, and Bernard Julia were 
able to show in 1978 that supergravity could be written, in its most general 
form, as an 11-dimensional theory. Supergravity theories with more than 11 
dimensions fell apart.
Supergravity ultimately fell prey to the mathematical inconsistencies that 
plagued most quantum gravity theories (it worked fine as a classical theory, 
so long as you kept it away from the quantum realm), leaving room for 
superstring theory to rise again in the mid-1980s, but it didn’t go away 
completely. I return to the idea of the 11-dimensional supergravity theory in 
Chapter 11.
String theorists don’t get no respect
During the late 1970s, string theorists were finding it hard to be taken 
seriously, let alone find secure academic work. String theorists’ search for 
respect in the field of physics reminds me of a young Einstein working in 
the Bern patent office, denied job after job while he thought about mass and 
energy.
There had been earlier issues in getting recognition for string theory work. 
The journal Physics Review Letters didn’t consider Susskind’s 1970 work — 
interpreting the dual resonance model as vibrating strings — significant 
enough to publish. Susskind himself tells how physics giant Murray Gell-
Mann laughed at him for mentioning string theory in 1970. (The story ends 
well, with Gell-Mann expressing interest in the theory in 1972.)
As the decade progressed, two of the major forces behind string theory 
would run into hurdle after hurdle in getting a secure professorship. John 
Schwarz had been denied tenure at Princeton in 1972 and spent the next 12 

177
 Chapter 10: Early Strings and Superstrings: Unearthing the Theory’s Beginnings
years at CalTech in a temporary position, never sure if the funding for his job 
would be renewed. Pierre Ramond, who had discovered supersymmetry and 
helped rescue string theory from oblivion, was denied tenure at Yale in 1976.
Against the backdrop of professional uncertainty, the few string theorists 
continued their work through the late 1970s and early 1980s, helping deal 
with some of the extra dimensional hurdles in supergravity and other 
theories, until the day came when the tables turned and they were able 
to lay claim to the high ground of theoretical physics.
A Theory of Everything: The First 
Superstring Revolution
The year 1984 is marked by many as the start of “the first superstring 
revolution.” The major finding that sparked the revolution was the proof that 
string theory contained no anomalies, unlike many of the quantum gravity 
theories, including supergravity, studied during the 1970s.
For nearly a decade, John Schwarz had been working on showing that 
superstring theory could be a quantum theory of gravity. His major partner 
in this, Joel Scherk, had died in 1980, a tragic blow to the cause. By 1983, 
Schwarz was working with Michael Green, one of the few individuals who had 
been persuaded to work on string theory during that time.
Typically, two major problems arose in theories of quantum gravity: 
anomalies and infinities. Neither is a good sign for a scientific theory.
	
✓	Infinities occur when values, such as energy, probability, or curvature, 
begin increasing rapidly to an infinite value.
	
✓	Anomalies are cases where quantum mechanical processes can violate 
a symmetry that is supposed to be preserved.
Superstring theory was actually pretty good at avoiding infinities.
	
One simplification that allows you to understand, in very general terms, how 
superstring theory avoids infinities is that the distance value never quite 
reaches zero. Dividing by zero (or a value that can get arbitrarily close to 
zero) is the mathematical operation that results in an infinity. Because the 
strings have a tiny bit of length (I call it L), the distance never gets smaller 
than L, and so the gravitational force is obtained by dividing by a number that 
never gets smaller than L2. This means that the gravitational force will never 
explode up to infinity, as happens when the distance approaches zero without 
a limit.

178
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
String theory also had no anomalies (at least under certain specific 
conditions), as Schwarz and Green proved in 1984. They showed that certain 
10-dimensional versions of superstring theory had exactly the constraints 
needed to cancel out all anomalies.
This changed the whole landscape of theoretical physics. For a decade, 
superstring theory had been ignored while every other method of creating a 
quantum theory of gravity collapsed in upon itself under infinities and 
anomalies. Now this discarded theory had risen from the ashes like a 
mathematical phoenix — both finite and anomaly free.
Theorists began to think that superstring theory had the potential to unify 
all the forces of nature under one simple set of physical laws with an elegant 
model in which everything consisted of different energy levels of vibrating 
strings. It was the ideal that had eluded Einstein: a fundamental theory of all 
natural law that explained all observed phenomena.
But We’ve Got Five Theories!
In the wake of 1984’s superstring revolution, work on string theory reached 
a fever pitch. If anything, it proved a little too successful. It turned out that 
instead of one superstring theory to explain the universe, there were five, 
given the colorful names
	
✓	Type I
	
✓	Type IIA
	
✓	Type IIB
	
✓	Type HO
	
✓	Type HE
And, once again, each one almost matched our world . . . but not quite.
By the time the decade ended, physicists had developed and dismissed many 
variants of string theory in the hopes of finding the one true formulation of 
the theory.
Instead of one formulation, though, five distinct versions of string theory 
proved to be self-consistent. Each had some properties that made physicists 
think it would reflect the physical reality of our world — and some properties 
that are clearly not true in our universe.

179
 Chapter 10: Early Strings and Superstrings: Unearthing the Theory’s Beginnings
The distinctions between these theories are mathematically sophisticated. 
I introduce their names and basic definitions mainly because of the key role 
they play in M-theory, which I introduce in Chapter 11.
Type I string theory
Type I string theory involves both open and closed strings. It contains a form 
of symmetry that’s mathematically designated as a symmetry group called 
O(32). (I’ll try to make that the most mathematics you need to know related 
to symmetry groups.)
Type IIA string theory
Type IIA string theory involves closed strings where the vibrational patterns 
are symmetrical, regardless of whether they travel left or right along the 
closed string. Type IIA open strings are attached to structures called 
D-branes (which I discuss in greater detail in Chapter 11) with an odd number 
of dimensions.
Type IIB string theory
Type IIB string theory involves closed strings where the vibrational patterns 
are asymmetrical, depending upon whether they travel left or right along the 
closed string. Type IIB open strings are attached to D-branes (discovered in 
1995 and covered in Chapter 11) with an even number of dimensions.
Two strings in one: Heterotic strings
A new form of string theory, called heterotic string theory, was discovered in 
1985 by the Princeton team of David Gross, Jeff Harvey, Emil Martinec, and 
Ryan Rohm. This version of string theory sometimes acted like bosonic string 
theory and sometimes acted like superstring theory.
A distinction of the heterotic string is that the string vibrations in different 
directions resulted in different behaviors. “Left-moving” vibrations resembled 
the old bosonic string, while “right-moving” vibrations resembled the Type 
II strings. The heterotic string seemed to contain exactly the properties that 
Green and Schwarz needed to cancel out anomalies within the theory.

180
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
	
It was ultimately shown that only two mathematical symmetry groups could 
be applied to heterotic string theory, which resulted in stable theories in ten 
dimensions — O(32) symmetry and E8 × E8 symmetry. These two groups gave 
rise to the names Type HO and Type HE string theory.
Type HO string theory
Type HO is a form of heterotic string theory. The name comes from the longer 
name Heterotic O(32) string theory, which describes the symmetry group 
of the theory. It contains only closed strings whose right-moving vibrations 
resemble the Type II strings and whose left-moving vibrations resemble the 
bosonic strings. The similar theory, Type HE, has subtle but important 
mathematical differences regarding the symmetry group.
Type HE string theory
Type HE is another form of heterotic string theory, based on a different 
symmetry group from the Type HO theory. The name comes from the longer 
name Heterotic E8 × E8 string theory, based on the symmetry group of the 
theory. It also contains only closed strings whose right-moving vibrations 
resemble the Type II strings and whose left-moving vibrations resemble the 
bosonic strings.
How to Fold Space: Introducing 
Calabi-Yau Manifolds
The problem of extra dimensions continued to plague string theory, but 
these were solved by introducing the idea of compactification, in which the 
extra dimensions curl up around each other, growing so tiny that they’re 
extremely hard to detect. The mathematics about how this might be achieved 
had already been developed in the form of complex Calabi-Yau manifolds, an 
example of which is shown in Figure 10-3. The problem is that string theory 
offers no real way to determine exactly which of the many Calabi-Yau 
manifolds is right!
When the extra dimensions were first discovered in the 1970s, it was clear 
that they must be hidden in some way. After all, we certainly don’t see more 
than three spatial dimensions.
One suggestion was the one that had been proposed by Kaluza and Klein a 
half century earlier: The dimensions could be curled up into a very small size.
Early attempts to curl up these extra dimensions ran into problems because 
they tended to retain the symmetry between left- and right-handed particles 
(called parity by physicists), which isn’t always retained in nature. This 
violation is crucial in understanding the operation of the weak nuclear force.

181
 Chapter 10: Early Strings and Superstrings: Unearthing the Theory’s Beginnings
	
Figure 10-3: 
According 
to string 
theory, the 
universe 
has extra 
dimensions 
that are 
curled up in 
Calabi-Yau 
manifolds.
	
For string theory to work, there had to be a way to compactify the extra six 
dimensions while still retaining a distinction between the left-handed and 
right-handed particles.
In 1985, the Calabi-Yau manifolds (created for other purposes years earlier by 
mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau) were used by Edward 
Witten, Philip Candelas, Gary Horowitz, and Andrew Strominger to compactify 
the extra six space dimensions in just the right way. These manifolds not only 
preserved the handedness of the particles, but they also preserved super­
symmetry just enough to replicate certain aspects of the Standard Model.
One benefit of the Calabi-Yau manifolds was that the geometry of the folded 
dimensions gives rise to different types of observable particles in our 
universe. If the Calabi-Yau shape has three holes (or rather higher-
dimensional analogs of holes), three families of particles will be predicted 
by the Standard Model of particle physics. (Obviously, by extension, a shape 
with five holes will have five families, but physicists are only concerned with 
the three families of particles that they know exist in this universe.)
Unfortunately, there are tens of thousands of possible Calabi-Yau manifolds 
for six dimensions, and string theory offers no reasonable means of 
determining which is the right one. For that matter, even if physicists 
could determine which one was the right one, they’d still want to answer 
the question of why the universe folded up the extra six dimensions in that 
particular configuration.
When Calabi-Yau manifolds were first discovered, it was hoped by some 
vocal members of the string theory community that one specific manifold 
would fall out as the right one. This hasn’t proved to be the case, and this is 
what many string theorists would have expected in the first place — that the 
specific Calabi-Yau manifold is a quantity that has to be determined by 
experiment. In fact, it’s now known that some other geometries for folded 
spaces can also maintain the needed properties. I talk about the implications 
of this folded space — what it could really mean — in Chapters 13 and 14.

182
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
String Theory Loses Steam
The rising tide of string theory research couldn’t last forever, and by the 
early 1990s some were giving up any hope of finding one single theory. Just 
as the earlier introduction of multiple dimensions had warded off new 
physicists, the rise of so many distinct yet consistent versions of string 
theory gave many physicists pause. Physicists who were motivated purely by 
the drive to find a quick and easy “theory of everything” began turning away 
from string theory when it became clear that there was nothing quick and 
easy about it. As the easier problems got solved and only the harder ones 
remained, the truly dedicated retained the motivation to work through the 
complications.
In 1995, a second string theory revolution would come along, with the rise 
of new insights that would help convince even many of the skeptics that 
work on string theory would ultimately bear significant fruit. That second 
revolution is the topic of Chapter 11.

Chapter 11
M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing 
String Theory Together
In This Chapter
▶	M-theory re-energizes the movement
▶	Thinking about branes
▶	Overcoming the conundrum of dark energy
▶	So many string theories, why pick just one?
T
he last chapter ended with five versions of string theories. Theorists 
continued their work, but were uncertain how to take these findings. A 
new insight was needed to generate further progress in the field.
In this chapter, I explain how that insight came about in the form of M-theory, 
which unified these string theories into one theory. I discuss how string 
theory was expanded to include objects with more than one dimension, 
called branes. I introduce some possible insights that may help explain what 
M-theory is trying to describe. I show how the discovery of dark energy, 
unpredicted by string theory, has complicated string theory, as well as 
introduced a large number of possible correct solutions to the theories. 
Finally, I examine how some physicists have used the anthropic principle to 
try to give meaning to this landscape of string theories.
Introducing the Unifying Theory:
M-Theory
At a conference in 1995, physicist Edward Witten proposed a bold resolution 
to the problem of five distinct string theories. In his theory, based on newly 
discovered dualities, each of the existing theories was a special case of one 
overarching string theory, which he enigmatically called M-theory. One of the 
key concepts required for M-theory was the introduction of branes (short 
for membranes) into string theory. Branes are fundamental objects in string 
theory that have more than one dimension.

184
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Witten didn’t thoroughly explain the true meaning of the name M-theory, 
leaving it as something that each person can define for himself. There are 
several possibilities for what the “M” could stand for: membrane, magic, 
mother, mystery, or matrix. Witten probably took the “M” from membrane 
because those featured so prominently in the theory, but he didn’t want to 
commit himself to requiring them so early in the development of the new 
theory.
	
Although Witten didn’t propose a complete version of M-theory (in fact, we’re 
still waiting on one), he did outline certain defining traits that M-theory would 
have:
	
✓	11 dimensions (10 space dimensions plus 1 time dimension)
	
✓	Dualities that result in the five existing string theories all being different 
explanations of the same physical reality
	
✓	Branes — like strings, but with more than one dimension
Translating one string theory 
into another: Duality
The core of M-theory is the idea that each of the five string theories 
introduced in Chapter 10 is actually a variation on one theory. This new 
theory — M-theory — is an 11-dimensional theory that allows for each of 
the existing theories (which are 10-dimensional) to be equivalent if you 
make certain assumptions about the geometry of the space involved.
The basis for this suggestion was the understanding of dualities that were 
being recognized among the various string theories. A duality occurs when 
you can look at the same phenomenon in two distinct ways, taking one 
theory and mapping it to another theory. In a sense, the two theories are 
equivalent. By the mid-1990s, growing evidence showed that at least two 
dualities existed between the various string theories; they were called 
T-duality and S-duality.
These dualities were based on earlier dualities conjectured in 1977 by Claus 
Montonen and David Olive. In the early 1990s, Indian physicist Ashoke Sen 
and Israeli-born physicist Nathan Seiberg did work that expanded on the 
notions of these dualities. Witten drew upon this work, as well as more recent 
work by Chris Hull, Paul Townsend, and Witten himself, to present M-theory.

 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
Topological duality: T-duality
One of the dualities discovered at the time was called T-duality, which refers 
to either topological duality or toroidal duality, depending on whom you 
ask. (Toroidal is a reference to the simplest case, which is a torus, or donut 
shape. Topological is a precise way of defining the structure of that space, 
as explained in the nearby sidebar “Topology: The mathematics of folding 
space.” In some cases the T-duality has nothing to do with a torus, and in 
other cases, it’s not topological.) The T-duality related the Type II string 
theories to each other and the heterotic string theories to each other, 
indicating that they were different manifestations of the same fundamental 
theory.
In the T-duality, you have a dimension that is compactified into a circle (of 
radius R), so the space becomes something like a cylinder. It’s possible for 
a closed string to wind around the cylinder, like thread on a spindle. (This 
means that both the dimension and the string have radius R.) The number 
of times the closed string winds around the cylinder is called the winding 
number. You have a second number that represents the momentum of the 
closed string.
Topology: The mathematics of folding space
The study of topology allows you to study 
mathematical spaces by eliminating all details 
from the space except for certain sets of 
properties that you care about. Two spaces 
are topologically equivalent if they share these 
properties, even if they differ in other details. 
Certain actions may be more easily performed 
on one of the spaces than the other. You then 
perform actions on that space and can work 
backward to find the resulting effect on the 
topologically equivalent space. It can be far 
easier than trying to perform these actions on 
the original space directly.
One of the key components of topology is the 
study of how different topological spaces 
relate to each other. Much of the time, these 
different spaces involve some sort of manipulation 
of the space, which is what adds the complexity. 
If this manipulation can be performed without 
breaking or reconnecting the space in a 
new way, the two spaces are topologically 
equivalent.
To picture this, imagine a donut (or torus) of clay 
that you slowly and meticulously recraft into the 
shape of a coffee mug. The hole in the center of 
the donut never has to be broken in order to be 
turned into the handle of the coffee mug. On the 
other hand, if you start with a donut, there’s no 
way to turn it into a pretzel without introducing 
breaks into the space — a donut and a pretzel 
are topologically distinct.

186
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Here’s where things get interesting. For certain types of string theory, if you 
wrap one string around a cylindrical space of radius R and the other around a 
cylindrical space of radius 1/R, then the winding number of one theory seems 
to match the momentum number (momentum, like about everything else, is 
quantized) of the other theory.
	
In other words, T-duality can relate a string theory with a large compactified 
radius to a different string theory with a small compactified radius (or, 
alternately, wide cylinders with narrow cylinders). Specifically, for closed 
strings, T-duality relates the following types of string theories:
	
✓	Type IIA and Type IIB superstring theories
	
✓	Type HO and Type HE superstring theories
The case for open strings is a bit less clear. When a dimension of superstring 
space-time is compactified into a circle, an open string doesn’t wind around 
that dimension, so its winding number is 0. This means that it corresponds 
to a string with momentum 0 — a stationary string — in the dual superstring 
theory.
The end result of T-duality is an implication that Type IIA and IIB superstring 
theories are really two manifestations of the same theory, and Type HO and 
HE superstring theories are really two manifestations of the same theory.
Strong-weak duality: S-duality
Another duality that was known in 1995 is called S-duality, which stands for 
strong-weak duality. The duality is connected to the concept of a coupling 
constant, which is the value that tells the interaction strength of the string 
by describing how probable it is that the string will break apart or join with 
other strings.
	
The coupling constant, g, in string theory describes the interaction strength 
due to a quantity known as the dilation field, ϕ. If you had a high positive 
dilation field ϕ, the coupling constant g = eϕ becomes very large (or the theory 
becomes strongly coupled). If you instead had a dilation field –ϕ, the coupling 
constant g = e–ϕ becomes very small (or the theory becomes weakly coupled).
Because of the mathematical methods (see nearby sidebar “Perturbation 
theory: String theory’s method of approximation”) that string theorists have 
to use to approximate the solutions to string theory problems, it was very 
hard to determine what would happen to string theories that were strongly 
coupled.
In S-duality, a strong coupling in one theory relates to a weak coupling in 
another theory, in certain conditions. In one theory, the strings break apart 
and join other strings easily, while in the other theory they hardly ever do 
so. In the theory where the strings break and join easily, you end up with a 
chaotic sea of strings constantly interacting.

187
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
	
Trying to follow the behavior of individual strings is similar to trying to follow 
the behavior of individual water molecules in the ocean — you just can’t do it. 
So what do you do instead? You look at the big picture. Instead of looking at 
the smallest particles, you average them out and look at the unbroken surface 
of the ocean, which, in this analogy, is the same as looking at the strong 
strings that virtually never break.
	
S-duality introduces Type I string theory to the set of dual theories that T-duality 
started. Specifically, it shows that the following dualities are related to each other:
	
✓	Type I and Type HO superstring theories
	
✓	Type IIB is S-dual to itself
If you have a Type I superstring theory with a very strong coupling constant, 
it’s theoretically identical to a Type HO superstring theory with a very weak 
coupling constant. So these two types of theories, under these conditions, 
yield the exact same predictions for masses and charges.
Perturbation theory: String theory’s 
method of approximation
The equations of string theory are incredibly 
complex, so they often can only be solved through 
a mathematical method of approximation 
called perturbation theory. This method is 
used in quantum mechanics and quantum field 
theory all the time and is a well-established 
mathematical process.
In this method, physicists arrive at a first-order 
approximation, which is then expanded with 
other terms that refine the approximation. The 
goal is that the subsequent terms will become 
so small so quickly that they’ll cease to matter. 
Adding even an infinite number of terms will 
result in converging onto a given value. In 
mathematical speak, converging means that 
you keep getting closer to the number without 
ever passing it.
Consider the following example of convergence: 
If you add a series of fractions, starting with 1⁄2 
and doubling the denominator each time, and 
you added them all together (1⁄2 + 1⁄4 1⁄8 + . . . well, 
you get the idea), you’ll always get closer to a 
value of 1, but you’ll never quite reach 1. The 
reason for this is that the numbers in the series 
get small very quickly and stay so small that 
you’re always just a little bit short of reaching 1.
However, if you add numbers that double (2 + 
4 + 8 + . . . well, you get the idea), the series 
doesn’t converge at all. The solution keeps 
getting bigger as you add more terms. In this 
situation, the solution is said to diverge or 
become infinite.
The dual resonance model that Veneziano 
originally proposed — and which sparked 
all of string theory — was found to be only a 
first-order approximation of what later came to 
be known as string theory. Work over the last 
40 years has largely been focused on trying to 
find situations in which the theory built around 
this original first-order approximation can be 
absolutely proved to be finite (or convergent), 
and which also matches the physical details 
observed in our own universe.

188
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Using two dualities to unite 
five superstring theories
Both T-duality and S-duality relate different string theories together. Here’s a 
review of the existing string theory relationships:
	
✓	Type I and Type HO superstring theories are related by S-duality.
	
✓	Type HO and Type HE superstring theories are related by T-duality.
	
✓	Type IIA and Type IIB superstring theories are related by T-duality.
With these dualities (and other, more subtle ones, which relate IIA and IIB 
together with the heterotic string theories), relationships exist to transform 
one version of string theory into another one — at least for certain specially 
selected string theory conditions.
	
To solve these equations of duality, certain assumptions have to be made, 
and not all of them are necessarily valid in a string theory that would describe 
our own universe. For example, the theories can only be proved in cases of 
perfect supersymmetry, while our own universe exhibits (at best) broken 
supersymmetry.
String theory skeptics aren’t convinced that these dualities in some specific 
states of the theories relate to a more fundamental duality of the theories at 
all levels. Physicist (and string theory skeptic) Lee Smolin calls this the 
pessimistic view, while calling the string theory belief in the fundamental 
nature of these dualities the optimistic view.
Still, in 1995 it was hard not to be in the optimistic camp (and, in fact, many 
had never stopped being optimistic about string theory). The very fact 
that these dualities existed at all was startling to string theorists. It wasn’t 
planned, but came out of the mathematical analysis of the theory. This was 
seen as powerful evidence that string theory was on the right track. Instead 
of falling apart into a bunch of different theories, superstring theory was 
actually pulling back together into one single theory — Edward Witten’s 
M-theory — which manifested itself in a variety of ways.
The second superstring revolution begins: 
Connecting to the 11-dimensional theory
The period immediately following the proposal of M-theory has been called 
the “second superstring revolution,” because it once again inspired a flurry 
of research into superstring theory. The research this time focused on 
understanding the connections between the existing superstring theories 
and between the 11-dimensional theory that Witten had proposed.

189
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
Witten wasn’t the first one to propose this sort of a connection. The idea of 
uniting the different string theories into one by adding an 11th dimension had 
been proposed by Mike Duff of Texas A&M University, but it never caught on 
among string theorists. Witten’s work on the subject, however, resulted in a 
picture where the extra dimension could emerge from the unifications 
inherent in M-Theory — one that prompted the string theory community to 
look at it more seriously.
In 1994, Witten and colleague Paul Townsend had discovered a duality 
between the 10-dimensional superstring theory and an 11-dimensional 
theory, which had been proposed back in the 1970s: supergravity.
Supergravity resulted when you took the equations of general relativity and 
applied supersymmetry to them. In other words, you introduced a particle 
called the gravitino — the superpartner to the graviton — to the theory. In 
the 1970s this was pretty much the dominant approach to trying to get a 
theory of quantum gravity.
What Witten and Townsend did in 1994 was take the 11-dimensional super­
gravity theory from the 1970s and curl up one of the dimensions. They then 
showed that a membrane in 11 dimensions that has one dimension curled up 
behaves like a string in 10 dimensions.
	
Again, this is a recurrence of the old Kaluza-Klein idea, which comes up again 
and again in the history of string theory. By taking Kaluza’s idea of adding an 
extra dimension (and Klein’s idea of rolling it up very small), Witten showed 
that it was possible — assuming certain symmetry conditions — to show that 
dualities existed between the existing string theories.
There were still issues with an 11-dimensional universe. Physicists had 
shown supergravity didn’t work because it allowed infinities. In fact, every 
theory except string theory allowed infinities. Witten, however, wasn’t 
concerned about this because supergravity was only an approximation of 
M-theory, and M-theory would, by necessity, have to be finite.
It’s important to realize that neither Witten nor anyone else proved that all 
five string theories could be transformed into each other in our universe. In 
fact, Witten didn’t even propose what M-theory actually was.
	
What Witten did in 1995 was provide a theoretical argument to support the 
idea that there could be a theory — which he called M-theory — that united 
the existing string theories. Each known string theory was just an approximation 
of this hypothetical M-theory, which was not yet known. At low energy levels, 
he also believed that M-theory was approximated by the 11-dimensional 
supergravity theory.

190
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Branes: Stretching Out a String
In a sense, the introduction of M-theory marks the end of “string theory,” 
because it ceases to be a theory that contains only fundamental strings. 
M-theory also contains multidimensional membranes, called branes. Strings 
are only 1-dimensional objects, and therefore only one of the types of 
fundamental objects that make up the universe, according to the new 
M-Theory.
Branes have at least three key traits:
	
✓	Branes exist in a certain number of dimensions, from zero to nine.
	
✓	Branes can contain an electrical charge.
	
✓	Branes have a tension, indicating how resistant they are to influence or 
interaction.
String theory became more complex with the introduction of multidimensional 
branes. The first branes, called D-branes, entered string theory in 1989. 
Another type of brane, called a p-brane (not to be confused with the term you 
used to tease your younger sibling with), was later introduced. Later work 
showed that these two types of branes were in fact the same thing.
Branes are objects of multiple dimensions that exist within the full 10-
dimensional space required by string theory. In the language of string 
theorists, this full space is called the bulk.
One major reason that string theorists didn’t originally embrace branes was 
because introducing more elaborate physical objects went against the goal 
of string theory. Instead of simplifying the theory and making it more 
fundamental, branes made the theory more complicated and introduced 
more types of objects that didn’t appear to be necessary. These were the 
exact features of the Standard Model that string theorists hoped to avoid.
In 1995, though, Joe Polchinski proved that it wasn’t possible to avoid them. 
Any consistent version of M-theory had to include higher-dimensional 
branes.
The discovery of D-branes: Giving open 
strings something to hold on to
The motivation for D-branes came from work by Joe Polchinski, Jin Dai, and 
Rob Leigh of the University of Texas, and independent work performed at the 
same time by Czech physicist Petr Horˇava. While analyzing the equations of 

191
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
string theory, these physicists realized that the ends of open strings didn’t 
just hover out in empty space. Instead, it was as if the end of the open string 
was attached to an object, but string theory at the time didn’t have objects 
(other than strings) for it to attach to.
To solve this problem, the physicists introduced the D-brane, a surface that 
exists within the 10-dimensional superstring theory so open strings can 
attach to them. These branes, and the strings attached to them, are shown 
in Figure 11-1. (The “D” in D-brane comes from Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune 
Dirichlet, a German mathematician whose relationship to the D-brane comes 
from a special type of boundary condition, called the Dirichlet boundary 
condition, which the D-branes exhibit.)
	
Figure 11-1: 
Open strings 
attach to 
the brane at 
each end. 
The ends 
can attach 
to the same 
brane or 
to different 
branes.
	
	
It’s easiest to visualize these branes as flat planes, but the D-branes can exist 
in any number of dimensions from zero to nine, depending on the theory. A 
5-dimensional D-brane would be called a D5-brane.
It’s easy to see how quickly these D-branes can multiply. You could have a 
D5-brane intersecting a D3-brane, which has a D1-brane extending off of it. 
Open superstrings could have one end on the D1-brane and the other end on 
the D5-brane, or on some other D5-brane in another position, and D9-branes 
(extended in all nine dimensions of space-time) could be in the background 
of all of them. At this point, it’s clear that it begins to be quite difficult to 
picture this 10-dimensional space or keep all the possible configurations 
straight in any meaningful way.
In addition, the D-branes can be either finite or infinite in size. Scientists 
honestly don’t know the real limitations of how these branes behave. Prior to 
1995, few people paid much attention to them.

192
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Creating particles from p-branes
In the mid-1990s, Andrew Strominger performed work on another type of 
brane, called p-branes, which were solutions to Einstein’s general relativity 
field equations. The p represents the number of dimensions, which again can 
go from zero to nine. (A 4-dimensional p-brane is called a 4-brane.)
The p-branes expanded infinitely far in certain directions but finitely far in 
others. In those finite dimensions, they actually seemed to trap anything that 
came near them, similar to the gravitational influence of a black hole. This 
work has provided one of the most amazing results of string theory — a way 
to describe some aspects of a black hole (see the section “Using branes to 
explain black holes”).
In addition, the p-branes solved one problem in string theory: Not all of the 
existing particles could be explained in terms of string interactions. With 
the p-branes, Strominger showed that it was possible to create new particles 
without the use of strings.
A p-brane can make a particle by wrapping tightly around a very small, 
curled-up region of space. Strominger showed that if you take this to the 
extreme — picture a region of space that’s curled up as small as possible — 
the wrapped p-brane becomes a massless particle.
	
According to Strominger’s research with p-branes, not all particles in string 
theory are created by strings. Sometimes, p-branes can create particles as 
well. This is important because strings alone did not account for all the known 
particles.
Deducing that branes are 
required by M-theory
Strongly motivated by Edward Witten’s proposal of M-theory, Joe Polchinski 
began working intently on D-branes. His work proved that D-branes weren’t 
just a hypothetical construct allowed by string theory, but they were 
essential to any version of M-theory. Furthermore, he proved that the 
D-branes and p-branes were describing the same objects.
In a flurry of activity that would characterize the second superstring 
revolution, Polchinski showed that the dualities needed for M-theory only 
worked consistently in cases where the theory also contained higher 
dimensional objects. An M-theory that contained only 1-dimensional strings 
would be an inconsistent M-theory.

193
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
Polchinski defined what types of D-branes string theory allows and some of 
their properties. Polchinski’s D-branes carried charge, which meant that they 
interacted with each other through something similar to the electromagnetic 
force.
A second property of D-branes is tension. The tension in the D-brane 
indicates how easily an interaction influences the D-brane, like ripples 
moving across a pool of water. A low tension means a slight disturbance 
results in large effects on the D-brane. A high tension means that it’s harder 
to influence (or change the shape of) the D-brane.
If a D-brane had a tension of zero, then a minor interaction would have a 
major result — like someone blowing on the surface of the ocean and parting 
it like the Red Sea in The Ten Commandments. An infinite tension would mean 
the exact opposite: No amount of work would cause changes to the D-brane.
	
If you picture a D-brane as the surface of a trampoline, you can more easily 
visualize the situation. When the weight of your body lands on a trampoline, 
the tension in the trampoline is weak enough that it gives a bit, but strong 
enough that it does eventually bounce back, hurling you into the air. If the 
tension in the trampoline surface were significantly weaker or stronger, 
a trampoline would be no fun whatsoever; you’d either sink until you hit 
the ground, or you’d hit a flat, immovable trampoline that doesn’t sink (or 
bounce) at all.
	
Together, these two features of the D-branes — charge and tension — meant 
that they aren’t just mathematical constructs, but are tangible objects in their 
own right. If M-theory is true, D-branes have the capacity to interact with 
other objects and move from place to place.
Uniting D-branes and p-branes 
into one type of brane
Though Polchinski was aware of Strominger’s work on p-branes — they 
discussed their projects over lunch regularly — both scientists thought 
that the two types of branes were distinct. Part of Polchinski’s 1995 work 
on branes included the realization that they were actually one and the same 
object. At energy levels where predictions from string theory and general 
relativity match up, the two are equivalent.
It might seem odd that this hadn’t occurred to either of the men before 
1995, but there was no reason to expect that the two types of branes would 
be related to each other. To a layman, they sound basically the same — 
multidimensional surfaces existing in a 10-dimensional space-time. Why 
wouldn’t you at least consider that they’re the same things?

194
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Well, part of the reason may be based on the specific nature of scientific 
research. When you’re working in a scientific field, you are quite specific 
about the questions you’re asking and the ways in which you’re asking them. 
Polchinski and Strominger were asking different questions in different ways, 
so it never occurred to either of them that the answers to their questions 
might be the same. Their knowledge blinded them from seeing the 
commonalities. This sort of tunnel vision is fairly common and part of 
the reason why sharing research is so encouraged within the scientific 
community.
Similarly, for a laymen, the dramatic differences between these two types of 
branes are less clear. Just as someone who doesn’t study much religion may 
be confused by the difference between Episcopalian and Catholic theological 
doctrines, to a priest of either religion the differences are well-known, and 
the two are seen as extremely distinct.
In the case of branes, though, the laymen would have had clearer insight 
on the issue than either of the experts. The very details that made D-branes 
and p-branes so intriguing to Polchinski and Strominger hindered their 
ability to see past the details to the commonalities — at least until 1995, 
when Polchinski finally saw the connection.
	
Because of equivalence, both D-branes and p-branes are typically just referred 
to as branes. When referencing their dimensionality, the p-brane notation is 
usually the one used. Some physicists still use the D-brane notation because 
there are other types of branes that physicists talk about. (For the remainder 
of this book, I mainly refer to them as branes, thus saving wear and tear on my 
keyboard’s D key.)
Using branes to explain black holes
One of the major theoretical insights that string theory has offered is the 
ability to understand some black hole physics. These are directly related to 
work on p-branes, which, in certain configurations, can act something like 
black holes.
The connection between branes and black holes was discovered by Andrew 
Strominger and Cumrun Vafa in 1996. This is one of the few aspects of string 
theory that can be cited as actively confirming the theory in a testable way, 
so it’s rather important.
The starting point is similar to Strominger’s work on p-branes to create 
particles: Consider a tightly curled region of a space-dimension that has a 
brane wrapped around it. In this case, though, you’re considering a situation 
in which gravity doesn’t exist, which means you can wrap multiple branes 
around the space.

195
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
The brane’s mass limits the amount of electromagnetic charge the brane can 
contain. A similar phenomenon happens with electromagnetically charged 
black holes. These charges create an energy density, which contributes to the 
mass of the black hole. This places a limit on the amount of electromagnetic 
charge a stable black hole can contain.
In the case where the brane has the maximum amount of charge — called an 
extremal configuration — and the case where the black hole has the maximum 
amount of charge — called an extremal black hole — the two cases share 
some properties. This allows scientists to use a thermodynamic model of an 
extremal configuration brane wrapped around extra dimensions to extract 
the thermodynamic properties that scientists would expect to obtain from an 
extremal black hole. Also, you can use these models to relate near-extremal 
configurations with near-extremal black holes.
Black holes are one of the mysteries of the universe that physicists would 
most like to have a clear explanation for. For more details on how string 
theory relates to black holes, skip ahead to Chapter 14.
	
String theory wasn’t built with the intention of designing this relationship 
between wrapped branes and black holes. The fact that an artifact extracted 
purely from the mathematics of string theory would correlate so precisely 
with a known scientific object like a black hole, and one that scientists 
specifically want to study in new ways, was seen by everyone as a major 
step in support of string theory. It’s just too perfect, many think, to be mere 
coincidence.
Getting stuck on a brane: Brane worlds
With the introduction of all of these new objects, string theorists have begun 
exploring what they mean. One major step is the introduction of brane world 
scenarios, where our 3-dimensional universe is actually a 3-brane.
Ever since the inception of string theory, one of the major conceptual hurdles 
has been the addition of extra dimensions. These extra dimensions are 
required so the theory is consistent, but we certainly don’t seem to experience 
more than three space dimensions. The typical explanation has been to 
compactify the extra six dimensions into a tightly wound object roughly the 
size of the Planck length.
	
In the brane world scenarios, the reason we perceive only three spatial 
dimensions is that we live inside a 3-brane. There’s a fundamental difference 
between the space dimensions on the brane and those off the brane.

196
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
The brane world scenarios are a fascinating addition to the possibilities of 
string theory, in part because they may offer some ways in which we can 
have consistent string theories without resorting to elaborate compactification 
scenarios. Not everyone is convinced, however, that compactifications can 
be eliminated from the theory and even some brane world theories include 
compactification as well.
In the “Infinite dimensions: Randall-Sundrum models” section later in this 
chapter, I look at some specific brane world scenarios that have been proposed, 
which offer some intriguing explanations for aspects of our universe, such as 
how to resolve the hierarchy problem (from Chapter 8). In Chapter 15, the 
idea of brane worlds allows you to consider the possibility of escaping our 
universe and traveling to a different universe on another brane!
Matrix Theory as a Potential M-Theory
A year after the proposal of M-theory, Leonard Susskind introduced a 
suggestion for what the “M” could stand for. Matrix theory proposes that the 
fundamental units of the universe are 0-dimensional point particles, which 
Susskind calls partons (or D0-branes). (No, these particles have nothing to 
do with the buxom Miss Dolly Parton.) These partons can assemble into 
all kinds of objects, creating the strings and branes required for M-theory. 
In fact, most string theorists believe that matrix theory is equivalent to 
M-theory.
Matrix theory was developed by Leonard Susskind, Tom Banks, Willy 
Fischler, and Steve Shenker in the year after Witten proposed M-theory. 
(The paper on the topic wasn’t published until 1997, but Susskind presented 
the concept at a 1996 string theory conference prior to publication.) The 
theory is also approximated by 11-dimensional supergravity, which is one 
of the reasons string theorists think it’s appropriate to consider it equal to 
M-theory.
The name “parton,” which Susskind uses in his book The Cosmic Landscape 
(and I’ve used here) to describe these 0-dimensional branes, comes from a 
term used by the Nobel Prize-winning quantum physicist (and string theory 
skeptic) Richard P. Feynman. Both Feynman and his colleague and rival 
Murray Gell-Mann were working to figure out what made up hadrons. Though 
Gell-Mann proposed the quark model, Feynman had described a more vague 
theory where hadrons were made up of smaller pieces that he just called 
partons.
One intriguing aspect of the partons, noted by Witten, is that as they get 
close to each other, it becomes impossible to tell where the partons 
actually are. This may be reminiscent of the uncertainty principle in quantum 
mechanics, in which the position of a particle can’t be determined with 
absolute precision, even mathematically (let alone experimentally). It’s 

197
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
impossible to test this the same way scientists can test the uncertainty 
principle, because there’s no way to isolate and observe an individual parton. 
Even light itself would be made up of a vast number of partons, so “looking” 
at a parton is impossible.
Unfortunately, the mathematics involved in analyzing matrix theory is 
difficult, even by the standards string theorists use. For now, research 
continues, and string theorists are hopeful that new insights may show 
more clearly how matrix theory can help shed light on the underlying 
structure of M-theory.
Gaining Insight from the 
Holographic Principle
Another key insight into string theory comes from the holographic principle, 
which relates a theory in space to a theory defined only on the boundary of 
that space. The holographic principle isn’t strictly an aspect of string theory 
(or M-theory), but applies more generally to theories about gravity in any 
sort of space. Because string theory is such a theory, some physicists believe 
the holographic principle will lie at the heart of it.
Capturing multidimensional information 
on a flat surface
It turns out, as shown by Gerard ’t Hooft in 1993 (and developed with much 
help from Leonard Susskind), the amount of “information” a space contains 
may be related to the area of a region’s boundary, not its volume. (In quantum 
field theory, everything can be viewed as information.) In short, the 
holographic principle amounts to the following two postulates:
	
✓	A gravitational theory describing a region of space is equivalent to a 
theory defined only on the surface area that encloses the region.
	
✓	The boundary of a region of space contains at most one piece of 
information per square Planck length.
	
In other words, the holographic principle says that everything that happens 
in a space can be explained in terms of information that’s somehow stored 
on the surface of that space. For example, picture a 3-dimensional space that 
resides inside the 2-dimensional curled surface of a cylinder, as in Figure 11-2. 
You reside inside this space, but perhaps some sort of shadow or reflection 
resides on the surface.

Figure 11-2: 
The 
holographic 
principle 
says infor-
mation 
about a 
space is 
contained 
on the 
surface.
	
Now, here’s a key aspect of this situation that’s missing from our example: A 
shadow contains only your outline, but in ’t Hooft’s holographic principle, all 
of the information is retained. (See the nearby sidebar, “Inside a hologram.”)
Another example, and one that is perhaps clearer, is to picture yourself 
inside a large cube. Each wall of the cube is a giant television screen, which 
contains images of the objects inside the cube. You could use the informa­
tion contained on the 2-dimensional surface of the space to reconstruct the 
objects within the space.
Again, though, this example falls short because not all of the information is 
encoded. If I were to have objects blocking me in all six directions, my image 
wouldn’t be on any of the screens. But in the holographic principle view of 
the universe, the information on the surface contains all the information that 
exists within the space.
Connecting the holographic 
principle to our reality
The holographic principle is totally unexpected. You’d think that the informa­
tion needed to describe a space would be proportional to the volume of that 
space. (Note that in the case of more than three space dimensions, “volume” 
isn’t a precise term. A 4-dimensional “hypervolume” would be length times 
width times height times some other space direction. For now, you can 
ignore the time dimension.)

199
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
	
You can consider this principle in two ways:
	
✓	Our universe is a 4-dimensional space that is equivalent to some 
3-dimensional boundary.
	
✓	Our universe is a 4-dimensional boundary of a 5-dimensional space, 
which contains the same information.
In scenario 1, we live in the space inside the boundary, and in scenario 2, 
we are on the boundary, reflecting a higher order of reality that we don’t 
perceive directly. Both theories have profound implications about the nature 
of the universe we live in.
Considering AdS/CFT correspondence
Though presented in 1993, even Leonard Susskind says he thought it would 
be decades before there would be any way to confirm the holographic 
principle. Then, in 1997, Argentinean physicist Juan Maldacena published a 
paper, inspired by the holographic principle, that proposed something 
called the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, or AdS/CFT 
correspondence, which brought the holographic principle to center stage in 
string theory.
Inside a hologram
A hologram is a 2-dimensional image that 
contains all the 3-dimensional information of an 
object. When viewing a hologram, you can tilt 
the image and see the orientation of the shape 
move. It’s as if you see the object in the picture 
from a different angle. The process of making a 
hologram is called holography.
This is achieved through the interference 
patterns in light waves. The process involves 
using a laser — so all of the light has exactly 
the same wavelength — and reflecting it off of 
the object onto a film. (When I performed this 
experiment in my college Optics class, I used a 
small plastic horse.)
As the light strikes the film, it records 
interference patterns that, when properly 
developed, allow the film to encode the 
information about the 3-dimensional shape that 
was holographed. The encoded information 
then has to be decoded, which means the laser 
light again has to be shown through the film in 
order to see the image.
“White light” holograms exist, which don’t 
need laser light to view them. These are the 
holograms that you’re most familiar with, which 
manifest their image in ordinary light.

200
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
In Maldacena’s AdS/CFT correspondence, he proposed a new duality 
between a gauge theory defined on a 4-dimensional boundary (three space 
dimensions and one time dimension) and a 5-dimensional region (four space 
dimensions and one time dimension). In essence, he showed that there are 
circumstances in which the holographic principle scenario 2 is possible (see 
the preceding section).
As usual in string theory, one of those conditions is unbroken supersymmetry. 
In fact, the theoretical world he studied had the most amount of supersymmetry 
possible — it was maximally supersymmetrical.
Another condition was that the 5-dimensional region was something called 
an anti-de Sitter space, which means it had negative curvature. Our universe 
(at least at present) is more similar to a de Sitter space, as mentioned in 
Chapter 9. As such, it hasn’t yet been proved that the AdS/CFT correspondence 
(or something similar) specifically applies to our own universe (though 
thousands of papers have been written on the subject).
Even if the duality turns out not to be completely true, a growing body of 
theoretical work supports the idea that there is some sort of correspondence 
between string theory and gauge theory, even if only at some low levels of 
approximation. Calculations that are hard in one version of the theory may 
actually be easy in the other one, meaning that it may be crucial in figuring 
out how to complete the theory. This has helped support the idea that the 
holographic principle may ultimately prove to be one of the fundamental 
principles of M-theory.
The holographic principle, and specifically the AdS/CFT correspondence, 
may also help scientists further understand the nature of black holes. The 
entropy (or disorder) of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of 
the black hole, not its volume. This is one of the arguments in support of 
the holographic principle, because it’s believed that it would offer further 
physical explanation of black holes.
String Theory Gets Surprised 
by Dark Energy
The discovery of dark energy in 1998 meant that our universe needed to 
have a positive cosmological constant. The problem is that all of the string 
theories were built in universes with negative cosmological constants (or a 
zero value). When work did discover possible ways to incorporate a positive 
cosmological constant, it resulted in a theory that has a vast number of 
possibilities!

201
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
Dark energy is an energy that seems to fill much of the universe and causes 
space-time to expand. By current estimates, more than 70 percent of the 
universe is comprised of dark energy.
Prior to the 1998 discovery, the assumption was that the universe had a zero 
cosmological constant, so all the work done in string theory was focused on 
that sort of a universe. With the discovery of dark matter, priorities had to 
change. The search was on for a universe that had a positive cosmological 
constant.
Joe Polchinski and Raphael Bousso extended others’ earlier research by 
experimenting with extra dimensions that had electric flux (a number that 
represents the intensity of an electric field through a surface) wrapped 
around them. Branes carried charge, so they could also have flux. This 
construction had the potential to limit some parameters of the theory in a 
way that couldn’t vary continuously.
In 2003, a Stanford group including Renata Kallosh, Andrei Linde, Shamit 
Kachru, and Sandip Trivedi released a paper that showed ways to extend 
the Polchinski-Bousso thinking to construct string theories with a positive 
cosmological constant. The trick was to create a universe and then wrap it 
with branes and anti-branes to contain the electric and magnetic flux. This 
introduced the potential for two effects:
	
✓	It allowed a small positive cosmological constant.
	
✓	It stabilized the extra dimensions in string theory.
On the surface, this would seem to be an excellent outcome, providing two 
necessary components to string theory. Unfortunately, there was one little 
problem — there were far too many solutions!
Considering Proposals for Why 
Dimensions Sometimes Uncurl
Most string theory proposals have been based on the concept that the extra 
dimensions required by the theory are curled up so small that they can’t be 
observed. With M-theory and brane worlds, it may be possible to overcome 
this restriction.
A few scenarios have been proposed to try to describe a mathematically 
coherent version of M-theory, which would allow the extra dimensions to be 
extended. If any of these scenarios hold true, they have profound implications 
for how (and where) physicists should be looking for the extra dimensions of 
string theory.

202
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Measurable dimensions
One model that has gotten quite a bit of attention was proposed in 1998 by 
Savas Dimopoulos, Nima Arkani-Hamed, and Gia Dvali. In this theory, some of 
the extra dimensions could be as large as a millimeter without contradicting 
known experiments, which means that it may be possible to observe their 
effects in experiments conducted at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC). 
(This proposal has no unique name, but I call it MDM for millimeter dimension 
model. Who knows, maybe it’ll catch on!)
When Dimopoulos introduced MDM at a 1998 supersymmetry conference, it 
was actually something of a subversive act. He was making a bold statement: 
Extra dimensions were as important, if not more so, than supersymmetry.
Many physicists believe that supersymmetry is the key physical principle 
that will prove to be the foundation of M-theory. Dimopoulos proposed that 
the extra dimensions — previously viewed as an unfortunate mathematical 
complication to be ignored as much as possible — could be the fundamental 
physical principle M-theory was looking for.
In MDM, a pair of extra dimensions could extend as far as a millimeter away 
from the 3-dimensional brane that we reside on. If they extend much more than 
a millimeter, someone would have noticed by now, but at a millimeter, the 
deviation from Newton’s law of gravity would be so slight that no one would 
be any the wiser. So because gravity is radiating out into extra dimensions, it 
would explain why gravity is so much weaker than the brane-bound forces.
The way this works is everything in our universe is trapped on our 3-
dimensional brane except gravity, which can extend off of our brane to affect 
the other dimensions. Unlike in string theory, the extra dimensions wouldn’t 
be noticeable in experiments except for gravity probes, and in 1998, gravity 
hadn’t been tested at distances shorter than a millimeter.
Now, don’t get too excited yet. Experiments have been done to look for these 
extra millimeter-sized dimensions and, it turns out, they probably don’t exist. 
Experiments show that the dimensions have to be at least as small as a tenth 
of a millimeter, but that’s still far larger than in most other string theory 
scenarios. Instead of requiring the 1019 GeV (giga-electronvolts, a unit of 
energy) needed to explore the Planck length, exploring a millimeter would 
require only 1,000 GeV — still within the range of CERN’s LHC!
Infinite dimensions: Randall-Sundrum models
If a millimeter-sized dimension turned heads, the 1999 proposal by Lisa 
Randall and Raman Sundrum was even more spectacular. In these Randall-
Sundrum models, gravity behaves differently in different dimensions, 
depending on the geometry of the branes.

203
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
In the original Randall-Sundrum model, called RS1, they propose a brane 
that sets the strength of gravity. In this gravitybrane, the strength of gravity 
is extremely large. As you move in a fifth dimension away from the gravity­
brane, the strength of gravity drops exponentially.
	
An important aspect of the RS1 model is that the strength of gravity depends 
only on the position within the fifth dimension. Because our entire 3-brane 
(this is a brane world scenario, where we’re trapped on a 3-brane of space) is 
at the same fifth-dimensional position, gravity is consistent everywhere in the 
3-brane.
In a second scenario, called RS2, Randall and Sundrum realized that the 
3-brane that we’re stuck in could have its own gravitational influence. Though 
gravitons can drift away from the 3-brane into other dimensions, they can’t 
get very far because of the pull of our 3-brane. Even with large dimensions, 
the effects of gravity leaking into other dimensions would be incredibly small. 
Randall and Sundrum called the RS2 model localized gravity.
In both of these models, the key feature is that gravity on our own 3-brane is 
essentially always the same. If this weren’t the case, we’d have noticed the 
extra dimensions before now.
In 2000, Lisa Randall proposed another model with Andreas Karch called 
locally localized gravity. In this model, the extra dimension contained some 
Yet another string theory: F-theory
Another theory that sometimes gets discussed 
is called F-theory (the name is a joking 
reference to the idea that the M in M-theory 
stands for mother). Cumrun Vafa proposed 
F-theory in 1996 after noticing that certain 
complicated solutions of Type IIB string theory 
could be described in terms of a simpler 
solution of a different theory with 12 dimensions, 
up from the 10 dimensions of superstrings or the 
11 dimensions of M-theory. Unlike M-theory, 
where all the dimensions of space-time are 
treated on equal footing, two of the dimensions 
of F-theory are fundamentally different than the 
rest: They always have to be curled up. So now 
to get to three space dimensions, we have eight 
small dimensions instead of six!
This makes it seem as though the theory is 
getting more complicated, but in fact the 
F-theory description is often simpler. These 
eight dimensions include not only all the 
information from the previous six, but also infor­
mation about what branes exist in the solution 
(those setups could get complicated). This is 
an example of a common theme in the develop­
ment of string theory; more and more of the the­
ory’s details, such as what particles exist and 
how they interact, or what branes live where, 
can be described simply in terms of the geom­
etry of the extra dimensions. This geometry is 
often easier to understand and analyze.
F-theory has been receiving more attention in 
the past few years because its rich structure 
allows solutions that reproduce many of the 
phenomena of the Standard Model and GUT 
theories (see Chapter 12 for more on those).

204
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
negative vacuum energy. It goes beyond the earlier models, because it allows 
gravity to be localized in different ways in different regions. Our local area 
looks 4-dimensional and has 4-dimensional gravity, but other regions of the 
universe might follow different laws.
Understanding the Current Landscape: 
A Multitude of Theories
As far back as 1986, Andrew Strominger found that there was a vast number 
of consistent string theory solutions and observed that all predictive power 
may have been lost. Actually, when considering a negative cosmological 
constant (or zero), you apparently end up with an infinite number of possible 
theories.
	
With a positive cosmological constant — as needed in our universe, thanks 
to dark energy — things get better, but not by much. There are now a finite 
number of ways to roll up the branes and anti-branes so as to obtain a positive 
cosmological constant. How many ways? Some estimates have indicated as 
many as 10500 possible ways to construct such a string theory!
This is an enormous problem if the goal of string theory was to develop a 
single unified theory. The vision of both the first and second superstring 
revolutions (or at least the vision guiding some bandwagoners who jumped 
on board) was a theory that would describe our universe with no 
experimental observations required.
In 2003, Leonard Susskind published “The Anthropic Landscape of String 
Theory,” in which he very publicly gave up the idea that a unique string 
theory would be discovered. In the paper, Susskind introduced the concept 
of “the landscape” of string theories: a vast number of mathematically 
consistent possible universes, some of which actually exist. Susskind’s string 
theory landscape was his solution to the unfathomable number of possible 
string theories.
But with so many possibilities, does the theory have any predictive power? 
Can we use a theory if we don’t know what the theory is?
The anthropic principle requires observers
Susskind’s proposed solution involves relying on something known as the 
anthropic principle. This principle indicates that the reason the universe has 
the properties it does is because we’re here to observe them. If it had vastly 
different properties, we wouldn’t exist. Other areas of the multiverse may 
have different properties, but they’re too far away for us to see.

205
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
	
The anthropic principle was coined by Cambridge astrophysicist Brandon 
Carter in 1974. It exists in two basic versions:
	
✓	Weak anthropic principle: Our location (or region) of space-time 
possesses laws such that we exist in it as observers.
	
✓	Strong anthropic principle: The universe is such that there has to exist 
a region of space-time within it that allows observers.
If you’re reading these two variations of the anthropic principle and scratching 
your head, you’re in good company. Even string theorists who are now 
embracing the anthropic principle — such as Susskind and Joe Polchinski — 
once despised it as totally unscientific. This is in part due to the fact that the 
anthropic principle (in its strong form) is sometimes invoked to require a 
supernatural designer of the universe, something that most scientists (even 
religious ones) try to avoid in their scientific work. (Ironically, it is also often 
used, in the weak form, as an argument against a supernatural designer, as 
Susskind does in his book The Cosmic Landscape.)
For the anthropic principle to make sense, you have to consider an array of 
possible universes. Figure 11-3 shows a picture of the energy levels of possible 
universes, where each valley represents a particular set of string theory 
parameters.

Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
	
According to the weak anthropic principle, the only portions of the multiverse 
we can ever observe are the ones where these parameters allow us to exist.
In this sense, the weak anthropic principle is almost a given — it’s just always 
going to be true. That’s part of the point of it. Because we’re here, we can 
use the fact that we’re here to explain the properties the universe has. In 
the string theory landscape, so many possibilities are out there that ours is 
just one of them, which has happened to come into being, and we’re lucky 
enough to be here.
	
If the string theory landscape represents all the universes that are possible, 
the multiverse represents all the universes that actually exist. Distant regions 
of the multiverse may have radically different physical properties than those 
that we observe in our own section.
This concept is similar to Lisa Randall’s locally localized gravity (see the 
“Infinite dimensions: Randall-Sundrum models” section earlier in this chapter), 
where only our local region exhibits the gravity that we know and love in 
three space dimensions. Other regions could have five or six space dimensions, 
but that doesn’t matter to us, because they’re so far away that we can’t see 
them. These other regions are different parts of the multiverse.
In 1987, Nobel Prize-winner Steven Weinberg added a bit of credibility to the 
field. Using reasoning based on the anthropic principle, he analyzed the 
cosmological constant required to create a universe like ours. His prediction 
was a very small positive cosmological constant, only about one order of 
magnitude off from the value found more than a decade later.
This is a frequently cited case of when the anthropic principle led to a 
testable prediction, but I’ve never been particularly convinced that it’s that 
meaningful. Clearly, our universe is one in which galaxies formed the way 
they have — not too fast or too slow. Using that fact is totally uncontroversial 
as a means of determining the cosmological constant, but the anthropic 
principle goes further. It doesn’t just determine the cosmological constant, it 
supposedly explains why the cosmological constant has that value.
	
The key feature of anthropic reasoning is that there exists an entire multiverse 
of possibilities. If there’s just one universe, we have to explain why that universe 
is so perfectly suited for humans to exist. But if there are a vast number of 
universes, and they take on a wide range of parameters, then probability 
dictates that every once in a while a universe like ours will spring up, resulting 
in life forms and observers like us.

207
 Chapter 11: M-Theory and Beyond: Bringing String Theory Together
Disagreeing about the principle’s value
Since its introduction in 1974, the anthropic principle has invoked passion 
among scientists. It’s safe to say that most physicists don’t consider invoking 
the anthropic principle to be the best scientific tactic. Many physicists see it 
as giving up on an explanation, and just saying “it is what it is.”
At Stanford, Leonard Susskind and his colleagues seem to be embracing the 
anthropic principle. To hear (or read) Susskind on the subject, the string 
theory community is quickly jumping on board. It’s unclear whether the 
movement is spreading quite as intently as this rhetoric implies, though.
One barometer could be the literature. Out of 13 string theory books (written 
after 2003 — 8 popular books, 5 textbooks) within my reach at this moment, 
here are the statistics:
	
✓	5 make no mention of the anthropic principle in the index
	
✓	2 discuss the anthropic principle for precisely one paragraph
	
✓	2 contain more general discussions of the anthropic principle, lasting 
about two pages
	
✓	2 attack the landscape and anthropic principle as major failures of the 
theory, devoting roughly an entire chapter to the concept
	
✓	2 argue that the anthropic principle is crucial to understanding our 
universe (and one of those is written by Susskind himself)
On the other hand, a search of the arXiv.org theoretical physics database 
shows 218 hits on a search of the phrase “anthropic.” Searching on 
“anthropic principle” obtains 104 hits, and adding words such as “string” 
and “brane” only causes it to drop from there. For comparison, searching on 
“string theory,” “cosmological constant,” or even the far less popular “loop 
quantum gravity” result in so many hits that the search cuts off at only 1,000 
papers. So the jury is certainly still out on how well the string theory 
community has adopted the anthropic principle.
Some string theorists, such as David Gross, appear to be strongly opposed to 
anything that even hints at the anthropic principle. A large number of string 
theorists bought into it based on the idea — championed by Witten’s 
promise of M-theory in 1995 — that there would be a single theory at the end 
of the rainbow.

208
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
String theorists seem to be turning to the anthropic principle mostly out of a 
lack of other options. This certainly seems to be the case for Edward Witten, 
who has made public statements indicating he might be unenthusiastically 
turning toward anthropic thinking.
We end the chapter in many ways worse off than we began. Instead of five 
distinct string theory solutions, we have 10500 or so. It’s unclear what the 
fundamental physical properties of string theory are in a field of so many 
options. The only hope is that new observations or experiments will provide 
some sort of clue about which aspect of the string theory landscape to 
explore next.

N
o matter how impressive string theory is, without experimental 
confirmation, it’s nothing but mathematical speculation. As discussed 
in Chapter 4, science is an interplay of theory and experiment. String theory 
attempts to structure the experimental evidence around a new theoretical 
framework.
One problem with string theory is that the energy required to get direct 
evidence for the distinct predictions of the theory is typically so high that it’s 
very hard to reach. New experimental methods, such as the Large Hadron 
Collider (described later in this chapter), are expanding our ability to test in 
higher energy ranges, possibly leading to discoveries that more strongly 
support string theory predictions, such as extra dimensions and super-
symmetry. Probing the strings themselves requires massive amounts of 
energy that are still far away from any experimental exploration.
In this chapter, my goal is to look at different ways that string theory can 
be tested, so it can be either verified or disproved. First, I explain the work 
that still needs to be done to complete the theory so it can make meaningful 
predictions. I also cover a number of experimental discoveries that would 
pose complications for string theory. Then I discuss ways of proving that our 
universe does contain supersymmetry, a key assumption required by string 
theory. Finally, I outline the testing apparatus — those created in deep space 
and particle accelerators created on Earth.

210
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Understanding the Obstacles
As discussed in Chapter 11, string theory isn’t complete. There are a vast 
number of different string theory solutions — literally billions of billions of 
billions of billions of different possible variants of string theory, depending on 
the parameters introduced into the theory. So, in order to test string theory, 
scientists have to figure out which predictions the theory actually makes.
Before testing on string theory can take place, physicists need to filter 
through the massive possible number of solutions to find a manageable 
amount that may describe our universe. Most of the current tests related to 
string theory are measurements that are helping to define the current 
parameters of the theory. Then, after the remaining theoretical solutions 
are somehow assessed in a reasonable way, scientists can begin testing the 
unique predictions they make.
	
There are two features common to (almost) all versions of string theory, and 
scientists who are looking for evidence of string theory are testing these ideas 
even now:
	
✓	Supersymmetry
	
✓	Extra dimensions
These are string theory’s two cornerstone ideas (aside from the existence of 
strings themselves, of course), which have been around since the theory was 
reformulated into superstring theory in the 1970s. No theory that has tried to 
eliminate them has lasted very long.
Testing an incomplete theory 
with indistinct predictions
Right now, there is a great deal of confusion over what physical properties 
(other than supersymmetry and extra dimensions) lie at the heart of string 
theory. The holographic principle, anthropic principle, brane world scenarios, 
and other such approaches are becoming more popular, but scientists don’t 
know for certain how they apply in the case of our universe.
The energy constraints on string theory experiments are obviously a big 
obstacle, but I think for most skeptical theorists, lack of specific, distinct 
experiments is the more disturbing issue. The variants of string theory make 
few distinct predictions, so it’s hard to even think about testing it. Scientists 
can continue to test aspects of the Standard Model, to make sure that string 

211
 Chapter 12: Putting String Theory to the Test
theory predictions remain consistent, and they can look for properties such 
as supersymmetry or extra dimensions, but these are very general predictions, 
many of which are made not just by string theory. The first step in testing 
string theory is to figure out what the theory is telling us that is distinct from 
other theories.
Test versus proof
There’s really no way to prove something like string theory, as a whole. You 
can prove that a specific prediction (such as supersymmetry, which I get 
to later in this chapter) is true, but that doesn’t prove that the theory as a 
whole is true. In a very real sense, string theory can never be proved; it can 
just meet the test of time, the same way that other theories have done.
For scientists, this slight distinction is known and accepted, but there’s some 
confusion about it among nonscientists. Most people believe that science 
proves things about the laws of nature beyond a shadow of a doubt, but 
the truth is that science dictates there is always a shadow of a doubt in any 
theory.
	
A theory can be tested in two ways. The first is to apply the theory to explain 
existing data (called a postdiction). The second is to apply the theory to 
determine new data, which experiments can then look for. String theory has 
been very successful at coming up with postdictions, but it hasn’t been as 
successful at making clear predictions.
String theory, as Chapter 17 explains, has some valid criticisms that need to 
be addressed. Even if they are addressed, string theory will never be proved, 
but the longer it makes predictions that match experiments, the more support 
it will gain.
For this to happen, of course, string theory has to start making predictions 
that can be tested.
Testing Supersymmetry
One major prediction of string theory is that a fundamental symmetry exists 
between bosons and fermions, called supersymmetry. For each boson there 
exists a related fermion, and for each fermion there exists a related boson. 
(Bosons and fermions are types of particles with different spins; Chapter 8 
has more detail about these particles.)

Under supersymmetry, each particle has a superpartner. Every boson has a 
corresponding fermionic superpartner, just as every fermion has a bosonic 
superpartner. The naming convention is that fermionic superpartners end 
in “–ino,” while bosonic superpartners start with an “s.” Finding these 
superpartners is a major goal of modern high-energy physics.
The problem is that without a complete version of string theory, string 
theorists don’t know what energy levels to look at. Scientists will have to 
keep exploring until they find superpartners and then work backward to 
construct a theory that contains the superpartners. This seems only slightly 
better than the Standard Model of particle physics, where the properties of 
all 18 fundamental particles have to be entered by hand.
Also, there doesn’t appear to be any fundamental theoretical reason why 
scientists haven’t found superpartners yet. If supersymmetry does unify the 
forces of physics and solve the hierarchy problem, then scientists would 
expect to find low-energy superpartners. (The search for the Higgs boson 
has undergone these same issues within the Standard Model framework for 
years. It has yet to be detected experimentally either.)
Instead, scientists have explored energy ranges into a few hundred GeV, but 
still haven’t found any superpartners. So the lightest superpartner would 
appear to be heavier than the 17 observed fundamental particles. Some 
theoretical models predict that the superpartners could be 1,000 times 
heavier than protons, so their absence is understandable (heavier particles 
often tend to be more unstable and collapse into lower-energy particles if 
possible) but still frustrating.
Right now, the best candidate for a way to find supersymmetric particles 
outside of a high-energy particle accelerator (see the later section “Large 
Hadron Collider (LHC)”) is the idea that the dark matter in our universe may 
actually be the missing superpartners (see the later section “Analyzing dark 
matter and dark energy”).
Testing implications of supersymmetry
If supersymmetry exists, then some physical process takes place that causes 
the symmetry to become spontaneously broken as the universe goes from 
a dense high-energy state into its current low-energy state. In other words, 
as the universe cooled down, the superpartners had to somehow decay 
into the particles we observe today. If theorists can model this spontaneous 
symmetry-breaking process in a way that works, it may yield some testable 
predictions.

213
 Chapter 12: Putting String Theory to the Test
The main problem is something called the flavor problem. In the standard 
model, there are three flavors (or generations) of particles. Electrons, muons, 
and taus are three different flavors of leptons.
In the Standard Model, these particles don’t directly interact with each 
other. (They can exchange a gauge boson, so there’s an indirect interaction.) 
Physicists assign each particle numbers based on its flavor, and these numbers 
are a conserved quantity in quantum physics. The electron number, muon 
number, and tau numbers don’t change, in total, during an interaction. An 
electron, for example, gets a positive electron number but gets 0 for both 
muon and tau numbers.
	
Because of this, a muon (which has a positive muon number but an electron 
number of zero) can never decay into an electron (with a positive electron 
number but a muon number of zero), or vice versa. In the Standard Model and 
in supersymmetry, these numbers are conserved, and interactions between 
the different flavors of particles are prohibited.
However, our universe doesn’t have supersymmetry — it has broken 
supersymmetry. There is no guarantee that the broken supersymmetry 
will conserve the muon and electron number, and creating a theory of 
spontaneous supersymmetry breaking that keeps this conservation intact is 
actually very hard. Succeeding at it may provide a testable hypothesis, 
allowing for experimental support of string theory.
Testing Gravity from Extra Dimensions
The testing of gravity produces a number of ways to see if string theory 
predictions are true. When physicists test for gravity outside of our three 
dimensions, they
	
✓	Search for a violation of the inverse square law of gravity
	
✓	Search for certain signatures of gravity waves in the cosmic microwave 
background radiation (CMBR)
It may be possible that further research will result in other ways to determine 
the behavior of string theory or related concepts (see the nearby sidebar, 
“Detecting the holographic principle with gravity waves”).

214
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Testing the inverse square law
If extra dimensions are compactified in ways that string theorists have typically 
treated them, then there are implications for the behavior of gravity. 
Specifically, there might be a violation of the inverse square law of gravity, 
especially if gravitational force extends into these extra dimensions at small 
scales. Current experiments seek to test gravity to an unprecedented level, 
hoping to see these sorts of differences from the established law.
The behavior of gravity has been tested down to under a millimeter, so any 
compactified dimensions must be smaller than that. Recent models indicate 
that they may be as large as that, so scientists want to know if the law of 
gravitation breaks down around that level.
As of this book’s publication, no evidence has been found to confirm the 
extra dimensions at this level, but only time will tell.
Searching for gravity waves in the CMBR
General relativity predicts that gravity moves in waves through space-time. 
Although string theory agrees with this prediction, in most string theory-
based models of inflation, there are no observable gravity waves in the 
cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). Traditional inflation 
models that don’t take string theory into account do predict CMBR gravity 
waves.
Again, this turns out to be a search for evidence against string theory, but 
this has a bit more weight behind it than some of the others. Although the 
string theory landscape has predictions for scenarios where relativity breaks 
down, there doesn’t appear to be any mechanism in string theory for gravity 
waves in the CMBR, according to University of California cosmologist and 
string theorist Andrei Linde. (Linde made this statement in 2007 and work 
since then has produced some preliminary indications that string theory 
models of inflation may be compatible with gravity waves in the CMBR.)
At present, the evidence seems to be leaning toward there not being any 
gravity waves in the CMBR data. The Planck Surveyor spacecraft was 
successfully launched in May 2009, with even greater sensitivity than the 
current WMAP study. Scientists may get a more decisive take on whether 
these CMBR gravity waves exist at any time.

 Chapter 12: Putting String Theory to the Test
Disproving String Theory 
Sounds Easier Than It Is
With any theory, it’s typically easier to disprove it than to prove it, although 
one criticism of string theory is that it may have become so versatile that 
it can’t be disproved. I elaborate on this concern in Chapter 17, but in the 
following sections I assume that string theorists can pull together a specific 
theory. Having a working theory in hand makes it easier to see how it could 
be proved wrong.
Violating relativity
String theories are constructed on a background of space-time coordinates, 
so physicists assume relativity is part of the environment. If relativity turns 
out to be in error, then physicists will need to revise this simplifying 
assumption, although it’s unlikely that this alone would be enough to cause 
them to abandon string theory entirely (nor should it).
Detecting the holographic principle 
with gravity waves
Results from the GEO600 gravity wave detector 
in Germany may already have found evidence 
for the holographic principle, though the co-
creator of the holographic principle is skeptical.
In 2007, Fermilab physicist Craig Hogan realized 
that if the bits of information on the surface 
of space are Planck length in size (as the 
holographic principle suggests), the bits of 
information contained inside the space have 
to be larger. He then predicted that this would 
cause some static in gravity wave detectors. 
And, sure enough, static was being detected 
by GEO600 in precisely the way predicted.
This would seem like an open and shut case, 
but there are many possible sources of this 
noise in the GEO600, and until they’re eliminated 
everyone is cautiously optimistic. Plus, Hogan’s 
paper is not so much a theory as a neat idea, 
and no one is exactly sure what it means —
including string theory and holographic 
principle co-founder Leonard Susskind. 
Susskind told me in an e-mail that he doesn’t 
understand how the holographic principle 
would result in gravitational wave noise.

216
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
There are theories that predict errors in relativity, most notably the variable 
speed of light (VSL) cosmology theories of John Moffat, and Andreas Albrecht 
and João Magueijo. Moffat went on to create a more comprehensive revision 
of general relativity with his modified gravity (MOG) theories. These theories 
are addressed in Chapter 19, but they mean that the current assumptions of 
string theory contain errors.
Even in this case, though, string theory would survive. Elias Kiritsis and 
Stephon Alexander have both proposed VSL theories within the context of 
string theory. Alexander went on to do further work in this vein with the “bad 
boy of cosmology,” João Magueijo, who is fairly critical of string theory as a 
whole.
Mathematical inconsistencies
Given that string theory exists only on paper right now, one major problem 
would be a definitive proof that the theory contained mathematical 
inconsistencies. This is the one area where string theory has proved most 
adaptable, successfully avoiding inconsistencies for more than 20 years.
Of course, scientists know that string theory isn’t the whole story — the true 
theory is an 11-dimensional M-theory, which has not yet been defined. Work 
continues on various string theory approximations, but the fundamental 
theory — M-theory — may still prove to be nothing more than a myth (yet 
another word the M could stand for).
One weakness is in the attempt to prove string theory finite. In Chapter 17, 
you can read about the controversy over whether this has been achieved. (It 
appears that even among string theorists there’s a growing acknowledgement 
that the theory hasn’t been proved finite to the degree that it was once hoped 
it would be.)
To create his theory of gravity, Newton had to develop calculus. To develop 
general relativity, Einstein had to make use of differential geometry and 
develop (with the help of his friend Marcel Grossman) tensor calculus. 
Quantum physics was developed hand in hand with group representation 
theory by innovative mathematician Hermann Weyl. (Group representation 
theory is the mathematical study of how symmetries can act on vector 
spaces, which is at the heart of modern physics.)
Though string theory had already spawned innovative mathematics 
explorations, the fact that scientists don’t have any complete version of 
M-theory implies to some that some key mathematical insight is missing — 
or that the theory simply doesn’t exist.

217
 Chapter 12: Putting String Theory to the Test
Could Proton Decay Spell Disaster?
If one of the older attempts at unification of forces (called grand unification 
theories or GUTs) proves successful, it would have profound implications for 
string theory. One of the most elegant GUTs was the 1974 Georgi-Glashow 
model, proposed by Howard Georgi and Sheldon Glashow. This theory has 
one flaw: It predicts that protons decay, and experiments over the last 25 
years have not shown this to be the case. Even if proton decay is detected, 
string theorists may be able to save their theory.
The Georgi-Glashow model allows quarks to transform into electrons and 
neutrinos. Because protons are made of specific configurations of quarks, if 
a quark inside a proton were to suddenly change into an electron, the proton 
itself would cease to exist as a proton. The nucleus would emit a new form of 
radiation as the proton decayed.
	
This quark transformation (and resulting proton decay) exists because the 
Georgi-Glashow model uses a SU(5) symmetry group. In this model, quarks, 
electrons, and neutrinos are the same fundamental kind of particle, manifesting 
in different forms. The nature of this symmetry is such that the particles can, 
in theory, transform from one type into another.
Of course, these decays can’t happen very often, because we need protons to 
stick around if we’re going to have a universe as we know it. The calculations 
showed that a proton decays at a very small rate: less than one proton every 
1033 years.
This is a very small decay rate, but there’s a way around it by having a lot 
of particles. Scientists created vast tanks filled with ultrapure water and 
shielded from cosmic rays that could interfere with protons (and give false 
decay readings). They then waited to see if any of the protons decayed.
After 25 years, there has been no evidence of proton decay, and these 
experiments are constructed so there could be as many as a few decays a 
year. The results from the Super-Kamiokande, a neutrino observatory in 
Japan, show that an average proton would take at least 1035 years to decay. 
To explain the lack of results, the Georgi-Glashow model has been modified 
to include longer decay rates, but most physicists don’t expect to observe 
proton decay anytime soon (if at all).
If scientists did finally discover the decay of a proton, that would mean that 
the Georgi-Glashow model would need to be looked at anew. String theory 
gained success in part because of the failure of all other previous models, so 
if their predictions work, it may indicate poor prospects for string theory.

218
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
The string theory landscape remains as resilient as ever, and some predictions 
of string theory allow for versions that include proton decay. The decay 
timeframe predicted is roughly 1035 years — exactly the lower limit allowed 
by the Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatory.
The renewal of GUTs would not disprove string theory, even though the 
failure of GUT is part of the reason why string theory was originally adopted. 
String theories can now incorporate GUT in low-energy domains. But string 
theory can’t tell us whether we should anticipate that GUT exists or protons 
decay. Maybe or maybe not, and string theory can deal with it either way. 
This is just one of the many cases where string theory shows a complete 
ambivalence to experimental evidence, which some critics say makes it “un-
falsifiable” (as discussed at greater length in Chapter 17).
Looking for Evidence in the Cosmic 
Laboratory: Exploring the Universe
The problem with conducting experiments in string theory is that it requires 
massive amounts of energy to reach the level where the Standard Model 
and general relativity break down. Although I address manmade attempts 
to explore this realm in the next section, here I look at the different route 
the field of string cosmology takes — attempting to look into nature’s own 
laboratory, the universe as a whole, to find the evidence that string theorists 
need to test their theories.
Using outer space rays 
to amplify small events
Among the various phenomena in the universe, two types produce large 
amounts of energy and may provide some insight into string theory: gamma 
ray bursts (GRBs) and cosmic rays.
Some physical events are hard to see because they
	
✓	Are very rare (like, possibly, proton decay)
	
✓	Are very small (like Planck-scale events or possible deviations in 
gravity’s effects)
	
✓	Happen only at very high energies (like high-energy particle collisions)

219
 Chapter 12: Putting String Theory to the Test
Or, some combination of the three makes the event a challenge to witness. 
Scientists are unlikely to see these improbable events in laboratories on 
Earth, at least without a lot of work, so sometimes they look where they’re 
more likely to find them. Because both GRBs and cosmic rays contain very 
high energies and take so long to reach us, scientists hope they can observe 
these hard-to-see events by studying the cosmic happenings.
For years, physicists had used this method to explore potential breakdowns 
in special relativity, but Italian physicist Giovanni Amelino-Camelia of the 
University of Rome realized in the mid-1990s that this process could be used 
to explore the Planck length (and energy) scale.
Gamma ray bursts
Exactly what causes a gamma ray burst is disputed, but it seems to happen 
when massive objects, such as a pair of neutron stars or a neutron star and 
a black hole (the most probable theories), collide with each other. These 
objects orbit around each other for billions of years, but finally collapse 
together, releasing energy in the most powerful events observed in the 
universe, depicted in Figure 12-1.
	
Figure 12-1: 
When some 
stars die, 
they release 
massive 
bursts of 
energy.

The name gamma ray bursts clearly implies that most of this energy leaves 
the event in the form of gamma rays, but not all of it does. These objects 
release bursts of light across a range of different energies (or frequencies — 
energy and frequency of photons are related).

220
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
According to Einstein, all the photons from a single burst should arrive at the 
same time, because light (regardless of frequency or energy) travels at the 
same speed. By studying GRBs, it may be possible to tell if this is true.
Calculations based on Amelino-Camelia’s work has shown that photons of 
different energy that have traveled for billions of years could, due to 
(estimated and possibly over-optimistic) quantum gravity effects at the 
Planck scale, have differences of about 1 one-thousandth of a second (0.001s).
The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly the Gamma-ray Large Area 
Space Telescope, or GLAST) was launched in June 2008 as a joint venture 
between NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy, and French, German, Italian, 
Japanese, and Swedish government agencies. Fermi is a low-Earth orbit 
observatory with the precision required to detect differences this small.
So far, there’s no evidence that Fermi has identified Planck scale breakdown 
of general relativity. To date it’s identified a dozen gamma ray–only pulsars, a 
phenomenon that had never been observed before Fermi. (Prior to Fermi, 
pulsars — spinning and highly magnetized neutron stars that emit energy 
pulses — were believed to emit their energy primarily through radio waves.)
If Fermi (or some other means) does detect a Planck scale breakdown of 
relativity, then that will only increase the need for a successful theory of 
quantum gravity, because it will be the first experimental evidence that the 
theory does break down at these scales. String theorists would then be able 
to incorporate this knowledge into their theories and models, perhaps narrowing 
the string theory landscape to regions that are more feasible to work with.
Cosmic rays
Cosmic rays are produced when particles are sent out by astrophysical 
events to wander the universe alone, some traveling at close to the speed of 
light. Some stay bound within the galactic magnetic field, while others break 
free and travel between galaxies, traveling billions of years before colliding 
with another particle. These cosmic rays can be more powerful than our 
most advanced particle accelerators.
	
First of all, cosmic rays aren’t really rays. They’re stray particles in mostly 
three forms: 90 percent free protons, 9 percent alpha particles (two protons 
and two neutrons bound together — the nucleus of a helium atom), and 1 
percent free electrons (beta minus particles, in physics-speak).
Astrophysical events — everything from solar flares to binary star collisions 
to supernovae — regularly spit particles out into the vacuum of space, so our 
planet (and, in turn, our bodies) are constantly bombarded with them. The 
particles may travel throughout the galaxy, bound by the magnetic field of 
the galaxy as a whole, until they collide with another particle. (Higher energy 
particles, of course, may even escape the galaxy.)

221
 Chapter 12: Putting String Theory to the Test
Fortunately for us, the atmosphere and magnetic field of Earth protect us 
from the most energetic of these particles so we aren’t continuously dosed 
with intense (and lethal) radiation. The energetic particles are deflected or 
lose energy, sometimes colliding in the upper atmosphere to split apart into 
smaller, less energetic particles. By the time they get to us, we’re struck with 
the less intense version of these rays and their offspring.
Cosmic rays have a long history as experimental surrogates. When Paul Dirac 
predicted the existence of antimatter in the 1930s, no particle accelerators 
could reach that energy level, so the experimental evidence of its existence 
came from cosmic rays.
As the cosmic ray particles move through space, they interact with the 
cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). This microwave energy 
that permeates the universe is pretty weak, but for the cosmic ray particles, 
moving at nearly the speed of light, the CMBR appears to be highly energetic. 
(This is an effect of relativity, because energy is related to motion.)
In 1966, Soviet physicists Georgiy Zatsepin and Vadim Kuzmin, as well as the 
independent work of Kenneth Greisen of Cornell University, revealed that 
these collisions would have enough energy to create particles called mesons 
(specifically called pi-mesons, or pions). The energy used to create the pions 
had to come from somewhere (because of conservation of energy), so the 
cosmic rays would lose energy. This placed an upper bound on how fast the 
cosmic rays could, in principle, travel.
In fact, the GZK cutoff energy needed to create the pions would be about 1019 
eV (about one-billionth of the Planck energy of 1019 GeV).
The problem is that, while most cosmic ray particles fall well below this 
threshold, some very rare events that have had more energy than this 
threshold — around 1020 eV. The most famous of these observations was in 
1991 at the University of Utah’s Fly’s Eye cosmic ray observatory on the U.S. 
Army’s Dugway Proving Ground.
Research since then indicates that the GZK cutoff does indeed exist. The rare 
occurrence of particles above the cutoff is a reflection of the fact that, very 
occasionally, these particles reach Earth before they come in contact with 
enough CMBR photons to slow them down to the cutoff point.
These observations are in conflict with Japan’s Akeno Giant Air Shower Array 
(AGASA) project, which identified nearly ten times as many of these events. 
The AGASA results implied a potential failure of the cutoff, which could 
have had implications for a breakdown in relativity, but these other findings 
decrease the probability of this explanation.

222
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Still, the occasional existence of such energetic particles provides one means 
of exploring these energy ranges, well above what current particle accelerators 
could reach, so string theory may have a chance of an experimental test 
using high-energy cosmic rays, even if they are incredibly rare.
Analyzing dark matter and dark energy
One other astronomical possibility to get results to support string theory 
comes from the two major mysteries of the universe: dark matter and dark 
energy. These concepts are discussed at length in Chapters 9 and 14.
The most obvious way that dark matter could help string theory is if it’s 
found that the dark matter is actually supersymmetric particles, such as the 
photino (the superpartner of the photon) and other possible particles.
Another dark matter possibility is a theoretical particle called an axion, 
originally developed outside of string theory as a means of conserving 
certain symmetry relationships in quantum chromodynamics. Many string 
theories contain the axion, so it could be a possibility as well, although the 
properties suggested don’t really match what cosmologists are looking for.
Some of the most significant work in cosmology and astrophysics today are 
attempts to detect dark matter, and there seems to be a lot of it in the universe. 
So there’s some hope that physicists will make headway on its composition 
within the foreseeable future.
Detecting cosmic superstrings
Cosmic strings (which in this case are not the same things as the fundamental 
superstrings of string theory) were originally proposed in 1976 by Tom 
Kibble of Imperial College London, who suggested that in the aftermath of the 
big bang, as the universe went through a rapid cooling phase, defects may 
have remained behind. These defects in quantum fields are similar to when 
you rapidly freeze water into ice, creating a white substance that is full of 
defects.
For a while in the 1980s, some scientists thought cosmic strings might be the 
original seed material for galaxies, but the CMBR data doesn’t indicate this 
to be true. Years later, string theory would resurrect the notion of cosmic 
strings in a new form.
According to some string theory models, superstrings created in the big bang 
may have expanded along with the universe itself, creating cosmic superstrings. 
An alternate explanation explains these cosmic superstrings as remnants 
from the collision of two branes.

223
 Chapter 12: Putting String Theory to the Test
	
Cosmic superstrings would be incredibly dense objects. Narrower than a 
proton, a single meter of a cosmic superstring could weigh about the same as 
North America. As they vibrated in space, they could generate massive gravity 
waves rippling out through space-time.
One way of seeing the cosmic superstrings would be through the gravitational 
lensing, where the string’s gravity bends the light of a star, as shown in 
Figure 12-2. This might mean that we see one star in two different locations, 
each equally bright.

Star
According to Joe Polchinski, the best way to look for cosmic superstrings is 
to observe pulsars (such as the ones that Fermi is detecting, as mentioned 
earlier in this chapter). Pulsars are like astronomical lighthouses, spinning as 
they fire regular beams of electromagnetic radiation into the universe, which 
follow a predictable pattern. The gravity from a cosmic superstring could 
cause ripples in space-time that alter this pattern in a way that should be 
detectable here on Earth.
Looking for Evidence Closer to Home: 
Using Particle Accelerators
Although it would be nice if nature gave us the experimental results we need, 
scientists are never content to wait for a lucky break, which is why they 
proceed with experiments in apparatuses that they control. For high-energy 
particle physics, this means particle accelerators.
A particle accelerator is a device that uses powerful magnetic fields to 
accelerate a beam of charged particles up to incredibly fast speeds and then 
collides it with a beam of particles going the other way. Scientists can then 
analyze the results of the collision.

224
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is a particle accelerator at 
Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. It went online in 2000, after a 
decade of planning and construction.
The RHIC name comes from the fact that it accelerates heavy ions — that 
is, atomic nuclei stripped of their electrons — at relativistic speeds (99.995 
percent the speed of light) and then collides them. Because the particles are 
atomic nuclei, the collisions contain a lot of power in comparison to pure 
proton beams (though it also takes more time and energy to get them up to 
that speed).
By slamming two gold nuclei together, physicists can obtain a temperature 
300 million times hotter than the sun’s surface. The protons and neutrons 
that normally make up the nuclei of gold break down at this temperature into 
a plasma of quark and gluons.
This quark-gluon plasma is predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), 
but the problem is that the plasma is supposed to behave like a gas. Instead, 
it behaves like a liquid. According to Leonard Susskind, string theory 
may be able to explain this behavior using a variation on the Maldacena 
conjecture (described in Chapter 11). In this way, the quark-gluon plasma 
may be described by an equivalent theory in the higher-dimensional universe: 
a black hole, in this case!
These results are far from conclusive, but theorists are looking at the 
behavior of these collisions to find ways to apply string theory to make 
greater sense of the existing physical models (QCD in this case), which is a 
powerful tool to help gain support of string theory.
Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a massive apparatus, built underground 
at the CERN particle physics facility on the border of Switzerland and France. 
(CERN is the European particle physics center that was, in 1968, the birthplace 
of string theory.) The accelerator itself is about 27 kilometers (17 miles) in 
circumference, as shown in Figure 12-3. The 9,300 magnets of the facility can 
accelerate protons into collisions up to possibly 14 trillion electron volts 
(TeV), well beyond our current experimental limitations. The cost of the LHC 
was around $9 billion as of this writing.

On September 10, 2008, the LHC came online by officially running a beam 
the full length of the tunnel. On September 19, a faulty electrical connection 
caused a rupture in the vacuum seal, resulting in a leak of 6 tons of liquid 
helium. The repairs (and upgrades to avoid the problem in the future) were 
scheduled to take at least a year.
Due to this, there have yet to be any significant experimental results from the 
LHC, but they should be coming in the next year or so. The 14 TeV energy 
level might be able to reach several possible experimental results:
	
✓	Microscopic black holes, which would support predictions of extra 
dimensions
	
✓	Supersymmetric particle (sparticle) creation
	
✓	Experimental confirmation of the Higgs boson, the final Standard Model 
particle to remain unobserved
	
✓	Evidence of curled-up extra dimensions
One of the greatest pieces of evidence for string theory could actually be 
a lack of evidence. If the experiments at the LHC register some “missing 
energy,” a couple of possibilities could provide amazing support for string 
theory.

226
Part III: Building String Theory: A Theory of Everything 
	
✓	First, the collisions could create new sparticles that form dark matter, 
which then flows out of the facility without interacting with the normal 
matter (like, you know, the detector itself).
	
✓	Second, missing energy could result from energy (or sparticles) that are 
actually traveling directly into the extra dimensions, rather than into our 
own 4-dimensional space-time.
Either of these findings would be a great discovery, and either the 
supersymmetric particles or extra dimensions would have profound 
implications for string theory.
Colliders of the future
Particle accelerators are so massive that there are no set designs for them; 
each particle accelerator is its own prototype. The next one on the books 
appears to be the International Linear Collider (ILC), which is an electron-
positron collider. One benefit of this is that electrons and positrons, because 
they’re fundamental particles and not composite particles like protons, are a 
lot less messy when they collide.
The ILC has not been approved. Proposals, including location, could be voted 
on around 2012 and, if approved, it could be running in the late 2010s. Early 
estimates for the project give a minimum cost of $6.65 billion (excluding little 
things like actually buying the land and other incidental costs).
It’s also possible that the LHC might be the last of the large particle 
accelerators, because new proposed technologies may be developed that 
allow for rapid particle acceleration that doesn’t require massive facilities.
One such design, proposed at CERN, is the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). 
The CLIC would use a new two-beam accelerator, where one beam accelerates 
a second beam. The energy from a low-energy (but high-current) beam into 
a high-energy (but low-current) beam could allow for accelerations up to 
5 TeV in a much shorter distance than traditional accelerators. A decision on 
CLIC could be made in 2010, with construction probably completed shortly 
after 2020.

S
tring theory brings up many amazing possibilities 
about how to explain the fundamental properties of 
our universe, such as space, time, and matter itself. 
Though physicists are far from reaching a final version of 
string theory, there are many possible implications worth 
thinking about, even at this early stage in the theory’s 
development.
In this part, I explore the implications of string theory on 
our view of the universe. I explain how mathematicians 
and scientists use the concept of dimensions and how the 
extra dimensions in string theory can be interpreted. 
Then I return to the ideas of cosmology and show how 
string theory presents possible explanations for properties 
in our universe.
String theory can also be used as a means of presenting 
the ideas of other universes, some of which may in theory 
someday be accessible. Finally, I discuss the possibility of 
whether string theory could ever allow for time travel.

O
ne of the most fascinating aspects of string theory is the requirement of 
extra dimensions to make the theory work. String theory requires nine 
space dimensions, while M-theory seems to require ten space dimensions. 
Under some theories, some of these extra dimensions may actually be long 
enough to interact with our own universe in a way that could be observed.
In this chapter, you get a chance to explore and understand the meaning of 
these extra dimensions. First, I introduce the concept of dimensions in a very 
general way, talking about different approaches mathematicians have used to 
study 2- and 3-dimensional space. Then I tackle the idea of time as the fourth 
dimension. I analyze the ways in which the extra dimensions may manifest in 
string theory and whether the extra dimensions are really necessary.
What Are Dimensions?
Any point in a mathematical space can be defined by a set of coordinates, 
and the number of coordinates required to define that point is the number of 
dimensions the space possesses. In a 3-dimensional space like you’re used to, 
for example, every point can be uniquely defined by precisely three coordi­
nates — three pieces of information (length, width, and height). Each dimen­
sion represents a degree of freedom within the space.
Though I’ve been talking about dimensions in terms of space (and time), 
the concept of dimensions extends far beyond that. For example, the match­
making Web site eHarmony.com provides a personality profile that claims to 

230
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
assess you on 29 dimensions of personality. In other words, it uses 29 pieces 
of information as parameters for its dating matches.
	
I don’t know the details of eHarmony’s system, but I have some experience 
with using dimensions on other dating sites. Say you wanted to find a potential 
romantic partner. You’re trying to target a specific type of person by entering 
different pieces of information: gender, age range, location, annual income, 
education level, number of kids, and so on. Each of these pieces of informa­
tion narrows down the “space” that you’re searching on the dating site. If you 
have a complete space consisting of every single person who has a profile on 
the dating site, when your search is over you’re narrowed to searching only 
among those who are within the ranges that you’ve specified.
Say Jennifer is a female, age 30, in Dallas, with a college degree and one child. 
Those coordinates “define” Jennifer (at least to the dating site), and searches 
that sample those coordinates will include Jennifer as one of the “points” (if 
you think of each person as a point) in that section of the space.
The problem with this analogy is that you end up with a large number of 
points within the dating site space that have the same coordinates. There 
may be another girl, Andrea, who enters essentially identical information as 
Jennifer. Any search of the sample space that brings up Jennifer also brings 
up Andrea. In the physical space that we live in, each point is unique.
	
Each dimension — in both mathematics and in the dating site example — rep­
resents a degree of freedom within the space. By changing one of the coordi­
nates, you move through the space along one of the dimensions. For example, 
you can exercise a degree of freedom to search for someone with a different 
educational background or a different age range or both.
	
When scientists talk about the number of dimensions in string theory, they 
mean the degrees of freedom required for these theories to work without 
going haywire. In Chapter 10, I explain that the bosonic string theory required 
25 space dimensions to be consistent. Later, superstring theory required 9 
space dimensions. M-theory seems to require 10 space dimensions, and the 
later F-theory includes 12 total dimensions.
2-Dimensional Space: Exploring 
the Geometry of Flatland
Many people think of geometry (the study of objects in space) as a flat, 
2-dimensional space that contains two degrees of freedom — up or down and 
right or left. Throughout most of modern history, this interest has been the 
study of Euclidean geometry or Cartesian geometry.

231
 Chapter 13: Making Space for Extra Dimensions
Euclidean geometry: Think back 
to high school geometry
Probably the most famous mathematician of the ancient world was Euclid, 
who has been called the father of geometry. Euclid’s 13-volume book, 
Elements, is the earliest known book to have taken all the existing knowledge 
of geometry at the time of its writing (around 300 BCE). For nearly 2,000 
years, virtually all of geometry could be understood just by reading Elements, 
which is one reason why it was the most successful math book ever.
	
In Elements, Euclid started off presenting the principles of plane geometry — 
that is, the geometry of shapes on a flat surface, as in Figure 13-1. An impor­
tant consequence of Euclidean plane geometry is that if you take the measure 
of all three angles inside of a triangle, they add up to 180 degrees.
	
Figure 13-1: 
In Euclidean 
geometry, 
all figures 
are flat, as 
if drawn on 
a sheet of 
paper.
	
Later in the volumes, Euclid extended into 3-dimensional geometry of solid 
objects, such as cubes, cylinders, and cones. The geometry of Euclid is the 
geometry typically taught in school to this day.
Cartesian geometry: Merging algebra 
and Euclidean geometry
Modern analytic geometry was founded by French mathematician and phi­
losopher Rene Descartes, when he placed algebraic figures on a physical 
grid. This sort of Cartesian grid is shown in Figure 13-2. By applying concepts 
from Euclidean geometry to the equations depicted on the grids, insights into 
geometry and algebra could be obtained.

Around the same time that Galileo was revolutionizing the heavens, 
Descartes was revolutionizing mathematics. Until his work, the fields of alge­
bra and geometry were separate. His idea was to display algebraic equations 
graphically, providing a way to translate between geometry and algebra.
Books of many dimensions
The book Flatland: A Romance of Many 
Dimensions by Edwin A. Abbott, written in 1884, 
is a classic in the mathematics community for 
explaining the concept of multiple dimensions. 
In this book, A. Square lives in a flat world 
and gains perspective when he encounters a 
sphere passing through his world who pulls 
him out of it so he can briefly experience three 
dimensions.
Flatland appears to have been part of a grow­
ing popular culture interest in extra dimensions 
during the late 1800s. Lewis Carroll had written 
a story in 1865 entitled “Dynamics of a Particle,” 
which included 1-dimensional beings on a flat 
surface, and the idea of space going crazy is 
clearly a theme in Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures 
in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking 
Glass (1872). Later, H. G. Wells used the con­
cepts of extra dimensions in several stories, 
most notably in The Time Machine (1895), 
where time is explicitly described as the fourth 
dimension a full decade before Einstein pre­
sented the first inkling of relativity.
Various independent sequels have been writ­
ten to Flatland through the years to expand on 
the concept. These include Dionys Burger’s 
Sphereland (1965), Ian Stewart’s Flatterland 
(2001), and Rudy Rucker’s Spaceland (2002). A 
related book is the 1984 science-fiction novel 
The Planiverse, where scientists in our world 
establish communication with a Flatland-like 
world.

233
 Chapter 13: Making Space for Extra Dimensions
Using the Cartesian grid, you can define a line by an equation; the line is the 
set of solutions to the equation. In Figure 13-2, the line goes from the origin 
to the point (5, 3). Both the origin (0, 0) and (5, 3) are correct solutions to the 
equation depicted by the line (along with all the other points on the line).
	
Because the grid is 2-dimensional, the space that the grid represents contains 
two degrees of freedom. In algebra, the degrees of freedom are represented 
by variables, meaning that an equation that can be shown on a 2-dimensional 
surface has two variable quantities, often x and y.
Three Dimensions of Space
When looking in our world, it has three dimensions — up and down, left and 
right, back and forth. If you give a longitude, latitude, and an altitude, you can 
determine any location on Earth, for example.
A straight line in space: Vectors
Expanding on the idea of Cartesian geometry, you find that it’s possible 
to create a Cartesian grid in three dimensions as well as two, as shown in 
Figure 13-3. In such a grid, you can define an object called a vector, which has 
both a direction and a length. In 3-dimensional space, every vector is defined 
by three quantities.

Vectors can, of course, exist in one, two, or more than three dimensions. 
(Technically, you can even have a zero-dimensional vector, although it will 
always have zero length and no direction. Mathematicians call such a case 
“trivial.”)
Treating space as containing a series of straight lines is probably one of the 
most basic operations that can take place within a space. One early field of 
mathematics that focuses on the study of vectors is called linear algebra, 
which allows you to analyze vectors and things called vector spaces of any 
dimensionality. (More advanced mathematics can cover vectors in more 
detail and extend into nonlinear situations.)
	
One of the major steps of working with vector spaces is to find the basis for 
the vector space, a way of defining how many vectors you need to define any 
point in the entire vector space. For example, a 5-dimensional space has a 
basis of five vectors. One way to look at superstring theory is to realize that 
the directions a string can move can only be described with a basis of ten dis­
tinct vectors, so the theory describes a 10-dimensional vector space.
Twisting 2-dimensional space in three 
dimensions: The Mobius strip
In the classic book Flatland, the main character is a square (literally — he 
has four sides of equal length) who gains the ability to experience three 
dimensions. Having access to three dimensions, you can perform actions on 
a 2-dimensional surface in ways that seem very counterintuitive. A 2-dimen­
sional surface can actually be twisted in such a way that it has no beginning 
and no end!
The best known case of this is the Mobius strip, shown in Figure 13-4. The 
Mobius strip was created in 1858 by German mathematicians August 
Ferdinand Mobius and Johann Benedict Listing.
	
Figure 13-4: 
A Mobius 
strip is 
twisted so it 
has only one 
continuous 
surface.
	

235
 Chapter 13: Making Space for Extra Dimensions
	
You can create your own Mobius strip by taking a strip of paper — kind of like 
a long bookmark — and giving it a half-twist. Then take the two ends of the 
strip of paper and tape them together. Place a pencil in the middle of the sur­
face and draw a line along the length of the strip without taking your pencil off 
the paper.
A curious thing happens as you continue along. Eventually, without taking 
your pencil from the paper, the line is drawn on every part of the surface and 
eventually meets up with itself. There is no “back” of the Mobius strip, which 
somehow avoids the pencil line. You’ve drawn a line along the entire shape 
without lifting your pencil.
In mathematical terms (and real ones, given the result of the pencil experi­
ment), the Mobius strip has only one surface. There is no “inside” and “out­
side” of the Mobius strip, the way there is on a bracelet. Even though the two 
shapes may look alike, they are mathematically very different entities.
The Mobius strip does, of course, have an end (or boundary) in terms of 
its width. In 1882, the German mathematician Felix Klein expanded on the 
Mobius strip idea to create a Klein bottle: a shape that has no inside or out­
side surface, but also has no boundaries in any direction. Take a look at 
Figure 13-5 to understand the Klein bottle. If you traveled along the “front” of 
the path (with the x’s), you’d eventually reach the “back” of that path (with 
the o’s).
	
Figure 13-5: 
A Klein 
bottle has 
no boundary 
(edge).
	
	
If you were an ant living on a Mobius strip, you could walk its length and even­
tually get back to where you started. Walking its width, you’d eventually run 
into the “edge of the world.” An ant living on a Klein bottle, however, could go 
in any direction and, if it walked long enough, eventually find itself back where 
it started. (Traveling along the o path eventually leads back to the x’s.) The 

236
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
difference between walking on a Klein bottle and walking on a sphere is that 
the ant wouldn’t just walk along the outside of the Klein bottle, like it would on 
a sphere, but it would cover both surfaces, just like on the Mobius strip.
More twists in three dimensions:
Non-Euclidean geometry
The fascination with strange warping of space in the 1800s was perhaps 
nowhere as clear as in the creation of non-Euclidean geometry, where math­
ematicians began to explore new types of geometry that weren’t based on 
the rules laid out 2,000 years earlier by Euclid. One version of non-Euclidean 
geometry is Riemannian geometry, but there are others, such as projective 
geometry.
The reason for the creation of non-Euclidean geometry is based in Euclid’s 
Elements itself, in his “fifth postulate,” which was much more complex than the 
first four postulates. The fifth postulate is sometimes called the parallel postu­
late and, though it’s worded fairly technically, one consequence is important 
for string theory’s purposes: A pair of parallel lines never intersects.
Well, that’s all well and good on a flat surface, but on a sphere, for example, 
two parallel lines can and do intersect. Lines of longitude — which are 
parallel to each other under Euclid’s definition — intersect at both the 
north and south poles. Lines of latitude, also parallel, don’t intersect at all. 
Mathematicians weren’t sure what a “straight line” on a circle even meant!
One of the greatest mathematicians of the 1800s was Carl Friedrich Gauss, 
who turned his attention to ideas about non-Euclidean geometry. (Some ear­
lier thoughts on the matter had been kicked around over the years, such as 
those by Nikolai Lobachevsky and Janos Bolyai.) Gauss passed the majority 
of the work off to his former student, Bernhard Riemann. Riemann worked 
out how to perform geometry on a curved surface — a field of mathematics 
called Riemannian geometry. One consequence — that the angles of a triangle 
do not add up to 180 degrees — is depicted in Figure 13-6.

Sometimes

of a triangle 
don’t mea-

237
 Chapter 13: Making Space for Extra Dimensions
When Albert Einstein developed general relativity as a theory about the 
geometry of space-time, it turned out that Riemannian geometry was exactly 
what he needed.
Four Dimensions of Space-Time
In Einstein’s general theory of relativity, the three space dimensions connect 
to a fourth dimension: time. The total package of four dimensions is called 
space-time, and in this framework, gravity is seen as a manifestation of space-
time geometry. The story of relativity is told in Chapter 6, but some dimen­
sion-related points are worth revisiting.
Hermann Minkowski, not Albert Einstein, realized that relativity could be 
expressed in a 4-dimensional space-time framework. Minkowski was one of 
Einstein’s old teachers, who had called him a “lazy dog,” but he clearly saw 
the brilliance of relativity.
In a 1908 talk entitled “Space and Time,” Minkowski first broached the topic 
of creating a dimensional framework of space-time (also sometimes called a 
“Minkowski space”). The Minkowski diagrams, introduced in Chapter 6, are 
an attempt to graphically represent this 4-dimensional space on a 2-dimen­
sional Cartesian grid. Each point on the grid is a “space-time event,” and 
The mathematics of artwork
Understanding and manipulating space is a 
key feature of artwork, which often attempts 
to reflect a 3-dimensional reality on a 2-dimen­
sional surface. This is probably most notable 
in the work of Pablo Picasso and M. C. Escher, 
where space has been manipulated in such a 
way that the manipulation itself is part of the 
artistic message.
Most artists try to manipulate space so it’s not 
noticed. One of the most common examples 
of this is perspective, developed during the 
Renaissance, which involves creating an image 
that matches the way the eye perceives space 
and distance. Parallel railroad tracks appear to 
meet at the horizon, though they never meet in 
reality. On a 2-dimensional surface, the basis 
for the railroad tracks is a triangle that does, in 
fact, have a corner at the horizon line.
This is precisely the basis of the mathemati­
cal field of non-Euclidean geometry called 
projective geometry, where you take one 
2-dimensional space and project it in a pre­
cise mathematical way onto a second sur­
face. There is an exact 1-to-1 correspondence 
between the two spaces, even though they look 
completely different. The two images represent 
different mathematical ways of looking at the 
same physical space — one of them an infinite 
space and one a finite space.

238
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
understanding the ways these events relate to each other is the goal of ana­
lyzing relativity in this way.
	
Even though time is a dimension, it’s fundamentally different from the space 
dimensions. Mathematically, you can generally exchange “left” for “up” and 
end up with results that are fairly consistent. If you, however, exchange “left 
one meter” for “one hour from now,” it doesn’t work out so well. Minkowski 
divided the dimensions into spacelike dimensions and timelike dimen­
sions. One spacelike dimension can be exchanged for another, but can’t be 
exchanged with a timelike dimension. (In Chapter 16, you find out about some 
ideas regarding extra timelike dimensions in our universe.)
	
The reason for this distinction is that Einstein’s equations are written in such 
a way that they result in a term defined by the space dimensions squared 
minus a term defined by the time dimension squared. (Because the terms are 
squared, each term has to be positive, no matter what the value of the dimen­
sion.) The space dimensional values can be exchanged without any math­
ematical problem, but the minus sign means that the time dimension can’t be 
exchanged with the space dimensions.
Adding More Dimensions 
to Make a Theory Work
For most interpretations, superstring theory requires a large number of 
extra space dimensions to be mathematically consistent: M-theory requires 
ten space dimensions. With the introduction of branes as multidimensional 
objects in string theory, it becomes possible to construct and imagine wildly 
creative geometries for space — geometries that correspond to different pos­
sible particles and forces. It’s unclear, at present, whether those extra dimen­
sions exist in a real sense or are just mathematical artifacts.
	
The reason string theory requires extra dimensions is that trying to elimi­
nate them results in much more complicated mathematical equations. It’s 
not impossible (as you see later in this chapter), but most physicists haven’t 
pursued these concepts in a great deal of depth, leaving science (perhaps by 
default) with a theory that requires many extra dimensions.
As I mention earlier, from the time of Descartes, mathematicians have 
been able to translate between geometric and physical representations. 
Mathematicians can tackle their equations in virtually any number of dimen­
sions that they choose, even if they can’t visually picture what they’re talking 
about.

239
 Chapter 13: Making Space for Extra Dimensions
	
One of the tools mathematicians use in exploring higher dimensions is anal­
ogy. If you start with a zero-dimensional point and extend it through space, 
you get a 1-dimensional line. If you take that line and extend it into a second 
dimension, you end up with a square. If you extend a square through a third 
dimension, you end up with a cube. If you then were to take a cube and extend 
into a fourth dimension, you’d get a shape called a hypercube.
A line has two “corners” but extending it to a square gives four corners, while 
a cube has eight corners. By continuing to extend this algebraic relationship, 
a hypercube would be a 4-dimensional object with 16 corners, and a similar 
relationship can be used to create analogous objects in additional dimen­
sions. Such objects are obviously well outside of what our minds can picture.
	
Humans aren’t psychologically wired to be able to picture more than three 
space dimensions. A handful of mathematicians (and possibly some physi­
cists) have devoted their lives to the study of extra dimensions so fully that 
they may be able to actually picture a 4-dimensional object, such as a hyper­
cube. Most mathematicians can’t (so don’t feel bad if you can’t).
Whole fields of mathematics — linear algebra, abstract algebra, topology, 
knot theory, complex analysis, and others — exist with the sole purpose of 
trying to take abstract concepts, frequently with large numbers of possible 
variables, degrees of freedom, or dimensions, and make sense of them.
These sorts of mathematical tools are at the heart of string theory. 
Regardless of the ultimate success or failure of string theory as a physical 
model of reality, it has motivated mathematics to grow and explore new 
questions in new ways, and for that alone, it has proved useful.
Sending Space and Time on a Bender
Space-time is viewed as a smooth “fabric,” but that smooth fabric can be 
bent and manipulated in various ways. In relativity, gravity bends our four 
space-time dimensions, but in string theory more dimensions are bound up 
in other ways. In relativity and modern cosmology, the universe has an inher­
ent curvature.
The typical approach to string theory’s extra dimensions has been to wind 
them up in a tiny, Planck length–sized shape. This process is called compac­
tification. In the 1980s, it was shown that the extra six space dimensions of 
superstring theory could be compactified into Calabi-Yau spaces.
	
Since then, other methods of compactification have been offered, most nota­
bly G2 compactification, spin-bundle compactification, and flux compactifica­
tion. For the purposes of this book, the details of the compactification don’t 
matter.

240
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
	
To picture compactification, think of a garden hose. If you were an ant living 
on the hose, you’d live on an enormous (but finite) universe. You can walk 
very far in either of the length directions, but if you go around the curved 
dimension, you can only go so far. However, to someone very far away, your 
dimension — which is perfectly expansive at your scale — seems like a very 
narrow line with no space to move except along the length.
This is the principle of compactification — we can’t see the extra universes 
because they’re so small that nothing we can do can ever distinguish them as 
a complex structure. If we got close enough to the garden hose, we’d realize 
that something was there, but scientists can’t get close to the Planck length 
to explore extra compactified dimensions.
Of course, some recent theories have proposed that the extra dimensions may 
be larger than the Planck length and theoretically in the range of experiment.
Still other theories exist in which our region of the universe only manifests 
four dimensions, even though the universe as a whole contains more. Other 
regions of the universe may exhibit additional dimensions. Some radical theo­
ries even suppose that the universe as a whole is curved in strange ways.
Are Extra Dimensions Really Necessary?
Though string theory implies extra dimensions, that doesn’t mean that the 
extra dimensions need to exist as dimensions of space. Some work has been 
done to formulate a 4-dimensional string theory where the extra degrees of 
The wraparound universe
Some cosmologists have considered some 
extreme cases of space warping in our own 
universe, theorizing that the universe may be 
smaller than we think. A new field of cosmol­
ogy called cosmic topology attempts to use 
mathematical tools to study the overall shape 
of the universe.
In his 2008 book, The Wraparound Universe, 
cosmologist Jean-Pierre Luminet proposes the 
idea that our universe wraps around so it has no 
particular boundary, sort of like the Klein bottle 
in Figure 13-5. Any direction you look, you may 
be seeing an illusion, as if you were standing in 
a funhouse full of mirrors that appeared to go 
on forever. Distant stars may actually be closer 
than expected, but the light travels a larger path 
along the wraparound universe to reach us.
In this sort of a scenario, the horizon problem 
from Chapter 9 ceases to be an issue because 
the universe is small enough to have become 
uniform within the timeframe of our universe’s 
existence. Inflation is consistent with the wrap­
around universe hypothesis, but many of the 
problems it fixes are solved in other ways.

241
 Chapter 13: Making Space for Extra Dimensions
freedom aren’t physical space dimensions; but the results are incredibly 
complex, and it doesn’t seem to have caught on.
Several groups have performed this sort of work, because some physicists 
are uncomfortable with the extra space dimensions that seem to be required 
by string theory. In the late 1980s, a group worked on an approach called free 
fermions. Other approaches that avoid introducing additional dimensions 
include the covariant lattice technique, asymmetric orbifolds, the 4-D N=2 
string (what’s in a name?), and non-geometric compactifications. These are 
technically complex formulations of string theory (aren’t they all?) that seem 
to be ignored by virtually all popular books on the subject, which focus on 
the idea of extra dimensions to the exclusion of these alternative approaches. 
Even among string theorists, the geometric approach of compactifying extra 
dimensions is the dominant approach.
One early, technically complex (and largely ignored) approach to 4-dimen­
sional string theory is work performed by S. James Gates Jr., of the University 
of Maryland at College Park (along with assistance from Warren Siegel of 
Stony Brook University’s C. N. Yang Institute for Theoretical Physics). This 
work is by no means the dominant approach to 4-dimensional string theory, 
but it’s benefit is that it can be explained and understood (in highly simpli­
fied terms) without a doctorate in theoretical physics.
Offering an alternative 
to multiple dimensions
In Gates’s approach, he essentially trades dimensions for charges. This cre­
ates a sort of dual approach that’s mathematically similar to the approach in 
extra space dimensions, but doesn’t actually require the extra space dimen­
sions nor require guessing at compactification techniques to eliminate the 
extra dimensions.
This idea dates back to a 1938 proposal by British physicist Nicolas Kemmer. 
Kemmer proposed that the quantum mechanical properties of charge and 
spin were different manifestations of the same thing. Specifically, he said that 
the neutron and proton were identical, except that they rotated differently 
in some extra dimension, which resulted in a charge on the proton and no 
charge on the neutron. The resulting mathematics, which analyzes the physi­
cal properties of these particles, is called an isotopic charge space (originally 
developed by Werner Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli, then used by Kemmer). 
Though this is an “imaginary space” (meaning that the coordinates are unob­
servable in the usual sense), the resulting mathematics describes properties 
of protons and neutrons, and is at the foundation of the current Standard 
Model.

242
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
Gates’s approach was to take Kemmer’s idea in the opposite direction: If you 
wanted to get rid of extra dimensions, perhaps you could view them as imagi­
nary and get charges. (The word “charge” in this sense doesn’t really mean 
electrical charge, but a new property to be tracked, like “color charge” in 
QCD.) The result is to take vibrational dimensions of the heterotic string and 
view them as “left charge” and “right charge.”
When Gates applied this concept to the heterotic string, the trading didn’t 
come out even — to give up six space dimensions, he ended up gaining more 
than 496 right charges!
In fact, together with Siegel, Gates was able to find a version of heterotic 
string theory that matched these 496 right charges. Furthermore, their solu­
tion showed that the left charges would correspond to the family number. 
(There are three known generations, or families, of leptons as shown in 
Figure 8-1 in Chapter 8 — the electron, muon, and tau families. The family 
number indicates which generation the particle belongs to.)
	
This may explain why there are multiple families of particles in the Standard 
Model of particle physics. Based on these results, a string theory in four 
dimensions could require extra particle families! In fact, it would require many 
more particle families than the three that physicists have seen. These extra 
families (if they exist) could include particles that could make up the unseen 
dark matter in our universe.
Weighing fewer dimensions 
against simpler equations
The usefulness of these 4-dimensional results is hindered by the sheer com­
plexity of the resulting equations (even by string theory standards). Although 
all string theories are complex, 4-dimensional string theories have, to date, 
shown meager predictive power. Assuming the extra dimensions lead to 
equations that are easier to handle, most physicists choose to work under 
the assumption of greater numbers of dimensions.
	
This goes back to the idea that the principle of Occam’s razor, which says 
that a scientist shouldn’t make a theory unnecessarily complex. The simplest 
explanation that fits the facts is the one that physicists tend to gravitate 
toward.
In this case, Occam’s razor cuts both ways. The simpler mathematical equa­
tion of 10-dimensional string theory requires stipulating a large number of 
space dimensions that no one has ever observed, which would certainly 

243
 Chapter 13: Making Space for Extra Dimensions
seem to go against Occam’s razor. But the type of isotopic charge coordi­
nate used in Gates’s approach is exactly the same as the ones that provide 
the mathematical foundations of the Standard Model — where the isotopic 
dimensions aren’t observed.
In the end, the 4-dimensional interpretations of string theory are a powerful 
way of understanding how complex string theory can be. One of the most 
basic aspects of string theory has been the idea that it requires extra space 
dimensions, but this work shows that string theory doesn’t necessarily 
require even that. If these approaches are right, and the degrees of freedom 
inherent in the theory don’t require extra space dimensions, then the physi­
cal principles at the heart of string theory may be completely unexpected.

T
hough string theory started as a theory of particle physics, much of the 
significant theoretical work today is in applying the startling predictions 
of string theory and M-theory to the field of cosmology. Chapter 9 covered 
some of the amazing facts science has discovered about our universe, espe­
cially in the last century.
In this chapter, I return to these same ideas from the background of string 
theory. I explain how string theory relates to our understanding of the big 
bang, the theory of the universe’s origin. I then discuss what string theory 
has to say about another mystery of the universe — black holes. From there, 
I cover what string theory reveals about how the universe changes over time 
and how it may change in the future. Finally, I return to the question of why 
the universe seems perfectly tuned to allow for life and what, if anything, 
string theory (along with the anthropic principle) may have to say about it.
The Start of the Universe 
with String Theory
According to the big bang theory, if you extrapolate the expanding universe 
backward in time, the entire known universe would have been compacted 
down into a singular point of incredibly immense density. It reveals nothing, 
however, about whether anything existed a moment prior to that point. 
In fact, under the big bang theory — formulated in a universe of quantum 

246
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
physics and relativity — the laws of physics result in meaningless infinities at 
that moment. String theory may offer some answers to what came before and 
what caused the big bang.
What was before the bang?
String theory offers the possibility that we are “stuck” on a brane with three 
space dimensions. These brane world scenarios, such as the Randall-Sundrum 
models, offer the possibility that before the big bang something was already 
here: collections of strings and branes.
The search for an eternal universe
Scientists were originally very upset by the big bang theory, because they 
believed in an eternal universe, meaning that the universe had no starting 
point (and, on average, didn’t change over time). Einstein believed this, 
though he abandoned it when evidence suggested otherwise. Fred Hoyle 
devoted most of his career to trying to prove the universe was eternal. 
Today, some physicists continue to look for ways to explain what, if anything, 
existed before the big bang.
Some cosmologists say that the question of what happened at or before the 
big bang is inherently unscientific, because science currently has no way of 
extending its physical theories past the singularity at the dawn of our uni­
verse’s timeline. Others point out that if we never ask the questions, we’ll 
never discover a way to answer them.
	
Though string theory isn’t yet ready to answer such questions, that hasn’t 
stopped cosmologists from beginning to ask the questions and offer possible 
scenarios. In these scenarios, which are admittedly vague, the pre–big bang 
universe (which likely is not confined to only three space dimensions) is a 
conglomerate of p-branes, strings, anti-strings, and anti-p-branes. In many 
cases, these objects are still “out there” somewhere beyond our own 3-brane, 
perhaps even impacting our own universe (as in the case of the Randall-
Sundrum models).
One of these models was a pre–big bang model presented by Gabriele 
Veneziano — the same physicist who came up with the 1968 dual resonance 
model that sparked string theory. In this model, our universe is a black hole 
in a more massive universe of strings and empty space. Prior to the current 
expansion phase, there was a period of contraction. Though probably not 
completely true according to today’s major models, this work by Veneziano 
(and similar ideas by others) has an impact on most of the superstring cos­
mology work today, because it pictures our known universe as just a subset 
of the universe, with a vast “out there” beyond our knowledge.

247
 Chapter 14: Our Universe — String Theory, Cosmology, and Astrophysics
The old-fashioned cyclic universe model
One idea that was popular in the 1930s was that of a cyclic universe, in which 
the matter density was high enough for gravity to overcome the expansion of 
the universe. The benefit of this model was that it allowed the big bang to be 
correct, but the universe could still be eternal.
	
In this cyclic model, the universe would expand until gravity began to pull it 
back, resulting in a “big crunch” where all matter returned to the primordial 
“superatom” — and then the cycle of expansion would start all over again.
The problem is that the second law of thermodynamics dictates that the 
entropy, or disorder, in the universe would grow with each cycle. If the 
universe went through an infinite number of cycles, the amount of disorder 
in the universe would be infinite — every bit of the universe would be in 
thermal equilibrium with every other bit of the universe. In a universe where 
every region has exactly the same structure, no one region has more order 
than any other, so all regions have the maximum amount of disorder allowed. 
(If the universe had gone through a finite number of cycles, scientists still 
ran into the problem of how the whole thing started; they just pushed it back 
a few cycles. This kind of defeated the whole purpose of the model, so the 
model assumed an infinite number of cycles.)
String theory, however, might just have a way of bringing back the cyclic 
model in a new form.
What banged?
The big bang theory doesn’t offer any explanation for what started the origi­
nal expansion of the universe. This is a major theoretical question for cos­
mologists, and many are applying the concepts of string theory in attempts 
to answer it. One controversial conjecture is a cyclic universe model called 
the ekpyrotic universe theory, which suggests that our own universe is the 
result of branes colliding with each other.
The banging of strings
Well before the introduction of M-theory or brane world scenarios, there 
was a string theory conjecture of why the universe had the number of dimen­
sions we see: A compact space of nine symmetrical space dimensions began 
expanding in three of those dimensions. Under this analysis, a universe with 
three space dimensions (like ours) is the most likely space-time geometry.
In this idea, initially posed in the 1980s by Robert Brandenberger and 
Cumrun Vafa, the universe began as a tightly wound string with all dimen­
sions symmetrically confined to the Planck length. The strings, in effect, 
bound the dimensions up to that size.

248
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
Brandenberger and Vafa argued that in three or fewer dimensions, it would 
be likely for the strings to collide with anti-strings. (An anti-string is essen­
tially a string that winds in a direction opposite the string.) The collision 
annihilates the string which, in turn, unleashes the dimensions it was confin­
ing. They thus begin expanding, as in the inflationary and big bang theories.
	
Instead of thinking about strings and anti-strings, picture a room that has 
a bunch of cables attached to random points on the walls. Imagine that the 
room wants to expand with the walls and floor and ceiling trying to move 
away from each other — but they can’t because of the cables. Now imagine 
that the cables can move, and every time they intersect, they can recombine. 
Picture two taut cables stretching from the floor to the ceiling that intersect to 
form a tall, skinny X. They can recombine to become two loose cables — one 
attached to the floor and one attached to the ceiling. If these had been the 
only two cables stretching from floor to ceiling, then after this interaction, the 
floor and ceiling are free to move apart from each other.
In the Brandenberger and Vafa scenario, this dimension (up-down), as well as 
two others, are free to grow large. The final step is that in four or more space 
dimensions, the moving strings will typically never meet. (Think about how 
points moving in two space dimensions will probably never meet, and the 
rationale gets extended to higher dimensions.) So this mechanism only works 
to free three space dimensions from their cables.
In other words, the very geometry of string theory implies that this scenario 
would lead to us seeing fewer than four space dimensions — dimensions 
of four or more are less likely to go through the string/anti-string collisions 
required to “liberate” them from the tightly bound configuration. The higher 
dimensions continue to be bound up by the strings at the Planck length and 
are therefore unseen.
With the inclusion of branes, this picture gets more elaborate and harder to 
interpret. Research into this approach in recent years hasn’t been reassuring. 
Many problems arise when scientists try to embed this idea more rigorously 
into the mathematics of string theory. Still, this is one of the few explanations 
of why there are four dimensions that make any sense, so string theorists 
haven’t completely abandoned it as a possible reason for the big bang.
A brane-fueled, 21st-century cyclic model: The ekpyrotic universe
In the ekpyrotic universe scenario, our universe is created from the collision 
of branes. The matter and radiation of our universe comes from the kinetic 
energy created by the collision of these two branes.
The ekpyrotic universe scenario was proposed in a 2001 paper by 
Paul Steinhardt of Princeton University, Burt Ovrut of the University of 
Pennsylvania, and Neil Turok, formerly of Cambridge University and cur­
rently the director of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in 
Waterloo, Ontario, along with Steinhardt’s student, Justin Khoury.

249
 Chapter 14: Our Universe — String Theory, Cosmology, and Astrophysics
The theory builds on the ideas that some M-theory brane world scenarios 
show that the extra dimensions of string theory may be extended, perhaps 
even infinite in size. They are also probably not expanding (or at least string 
theorists have no reason to think they are) the way that our own three space 
dimensions are. When you play the video of the universe backward in time, 
these dimensions don’t contract.
	
Now imagine that within these dimensions you have two infinite 3-branes. 
Some mechanism (such as gravity) draws the branes together through the 
infinite extra dimensions, and they collide with each other. Energy is gener­
ated, creating the matter for our universe and pushing the two branes apart. 
Eventually, the energy from the collision dissipates and the branes are drawn 
back together to collide yet again.
The ekpyrotic model is divided into various epochs (periods of time), based 
upon what influences dominate:
	
✓	The big bang
	
✓	The radiation-dominated epoch
	
✓	The matter-dominated epoch
	
✓	The dark energy–dominated epoch
	
✓	The contraction epoch
	
✓	The big crunch
The story up until the contraction epoch is essentially identical to that made 
by regular big bang cosmology. The radiation that is spawned by the brane 
collision (the big bang) means the radiation-dominated epoch is fairly uni­
form (save for quantum fluctuations), so inflation may be unnecessary. After 
about 75,000 years, the universe becomes a particle soup during the matter-
dominated epoch. Today and for many years, we are in the dark energy–
dominated epoch, until the dark energy decays and the universe begins 
contracting once again.
Because the theory involves two branes colliding, some called this the “big 
splat” theory or the “brane smash” theory, which is certainly easier to pro­
nounce than ekpyrotic. The word “ekpyrotic” comes from the Greek word 
“ekpyrosis,” which was an ancient Greek belief that the world was born out of 
fire. (Burt Ovrut reportedly thought it sounded like a skin disease.)
Some feel that the ekpyrotic universe model has a lot going for it — it solves 
the flatness and horizon problems like inflationary theory does, while also 
providing an explanation for why the universe started in the first place — but 
the creators are still far from proving it. Stephen Hawking has bet Neil Turok 
that findings from the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite will verify 
the inflationary model and rule out the ekpyrotic model, but Hawking has 
been known to have to pay out on these sorts of bets in the past (as you can 

250
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
read about in the “String theory and the black hole information paradox” sec­
tion later in this chapter).
One benefit is that this model avoids the problem of previous cyclic models, 
because each universe in the cycle is larger than the one before it. Because 
the volume of the universe increases, the total entropy of the universe in 
each cycle can increase without ever reaching a state of maximum entropy.
	
There is obviously much more detail to the ekpyrotic model than I’ve included 
here. If you’re interested in this fascinating theory, I highly recommend Paul 
J. Steinhardt and Neil Turok’s popular book Endless Universe: Beyond the Big 
Bang. In addition to the lucid and nontechnical discussion of complex scien­
tific concepts, their descriptions offer a glimpse inside the realm of theoretical 
cosmology, which is well worth the read.
Explaining Black Holes 
with String Theory
One major mystery of theoretical physics that requires explanation is the 
behavior of black holes, especially regarding how black holes evaporate and 
whether they lose information. I introduce these topics in Chapter 9, but with 
the concepts of string theory in hand, you may be able to further your under­
standing of them.
Black holes are defined by general relativity as smooth entities, but at very 
small scales (such as when they evaporate down to the Planck length in size), 
quantum effects need to be taken into account. Resolving this inconsistency 
is the sort of thing that string theory should be good at, if it’s true.
String theory and the thermodynamics 
of a black hole
When Stephen Hawking described the Hawking radiation emitted by a black 
hole, he had to use his physical and mathematical intuition, because quantum 
physics and general relativity aren’t reconciled. One of the major successes of 
string theory is in offering a complete description of (some) black holes.
	
Hawking radiation takes place when radiation is emitted from a black hole, 
causing it to lose mass. Eventually, the black hole evaporates into nothing (or 
almost nothing).

251
 Chapter 14: Our Universe — String Theory, Cosmology, and Astrophysics
Stephen Hawking’s incomplete argument
Hawking’s paper on the way a black hole radiates heat (also called thermo-
dynamics) begins a line of reasoning that doesn’t quite work all the way 
through to the end. In the middle of the proof there’s a disconnect, because 
no theory of quantum gravity exists that would allow the first half of his rea­
soning (based on general relativity) to connect with the second half of his 
reasoning (based on quantum mechanics).
The reason for the disconnect is that performing a detailed thermodynamics 
analysis of a black hole involves examining all the possible quantum states 
of the black hole. But black holes are described with general relativity, which 
treats them as smooth — not quantum — objects. Without a theory of quan­
tum gravity, there seems to be no way to analyze the specific thermodynamic 
nature of a black hole.
In Hawking’s paper, this connection was made by means of his intuition, but 
not in the sense that most of us probably think of intuition. The intuitive leap 
he took was in proposing precise mathematical formulas, called greybody fac­
tors, even though he couldn’t absolutely prove where they came from.
Most physicists agree that Hawking’s interpretation makes sense, but a 
theory of quantum gravity would show whether a more precise process 
could take the place of his intuitive step.
String theory may complete the argument
Work by Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa on the thermodynamics of 
black holes is seen by many string theorists as the most powerful evidence in 
support of string theory. By studying a problem that is mathematically equiv­
alent to black holes — a dual problem — they precisely calculated the black 
hole’s thermodynamic properties in a way that matched Hawking’s analysis.
	
Sometimes, instead of simplifying a problem directly, you can create a dual 
problem, which is essentially identical to the one you’re trying to solve but is 
much simpler to handle. Strominger and Vafa used this tactic in 1996 to calcu­
late the entropy in a black hole.
In their case, they found that the dual problem of a black hole described a col­
lection of 1-branes and 5-branes. These “brane constructions” are objects that 
can be defined in terms of quantum mechanics. They found that the results 
matched precisely with the result Hawking anticipated 20 years earlier.
Now, before you get too excited, the Strominger and Vafa results only work 
for certain very specific types of black holes, called extremal black holes. 
These extremal black holes have the maximum amount of electric or mag­
netic charge that is allowed without making the black hole unstable. An extre­
mal black hole has the odd property of possessing entropy but no heat or 
temperature. (Entropy is a measure of disorder, often related to heat energy, 
within a physical system.)

252
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
At the same time Strominger and Vafa were performing their calculations, 
Princeton student Juan Maldacena was tackling the same problem (along 
with thesis advisor Curt Callan). Within a few weeks of Strominger and Vafa, 
they had confirmed the results and extended the analysis to black holes that 
are almost extremal. Again, the relationship holds up quite well between 
these brane constructions and black holes, and analyzing the brane construc­
tions yields the results Hawking anticipated for black holes. Further work has 
expanded this work to even more generalized cases of black holes.
	
To get this analysis to work, gravity has to be turned down to zero, which cer­
tainly seems strange in the case of a black hole that is, quite literally, defined 
by gravity. Turning off the gravity is needed to simplify the equations and 
obtain the relationship. String theorists conjecture that by ramping up the 
gravity again you’d end up with a black hole, but string theory skeptics point 
out that without gravity you really don’t have a black hole.
Still, even a skeptic can’t help but think that there must be some sort of rela­
tionship between the brane constructions and the black holes because they 
both follow the Hawking thermodynamics analysis created 20 years earlier. 
What’s even more amazing is that string theory wasn’t designed to solve this 
specific problem, yet it did. The fact that the result falls out of the analysis is 
impressive, to say the least.
String theory and the black 
hole information paradox
One of the important aspects of the thermodynamics of black holes relates to 
the black hole information paradox. This paradox may well have a solution in 
string theory, either in the string theory analyses described in the previous 
section or in the holographic principle.
Hawking had said that if an object falls into a black hole, the only information 
that is retained are the quantum mechanical properties of mass, spin, and 
charge. All other information was stripped away.
The problem with this is that quantum mechanics is built on the idea that 
information can’t be lost. If information can be lost, then quantum mechanics 
isn’t a secure theoretical structure. Hawking, as a relativist, was more con­
cerned with maintaining the theoretical structure of general relativity, so he 
was okay with the information being lost if it had to be.
	
The reason that this lost information is such a major issue for quantum 
mechanics once again ties into thermodynamics. In quantum mechanics, infor­
mation is related to the thermodynamic concept of “order.” If information is 
lost, then order is lost — meaning that entropy (disorder) is increased. This 
means that the black holes would begin generating heat, rising up to billions 

253
 Chapter 14: Our Universe — String Theory, Cosmology, and Astrophysics
of billions of degrees in mere moments. Though Leonard Susskind and others 
realized this in the mid-1980s, they couldn’t find the flaws in Hawking’s reason­
ing that would prove him wrong.
In 2004, after a debate that lasted more than 20 years, Hawking announced 
that he no longer believed this information was forever lost to the universe. 
In doing so, he lost a 1997 bet with physicist John Preskill. The payoff was a 
baseball encyclopedia, from which information could be retrieved easily. And 
who said physicists didn’t have a sense of humor?
One reason for Hawking’s change of mind was that he redid some of his ear­
lier calculations and found that it was possible that, as an object fell into a 
black hole, it would disturb the black hole’s radiation field. The information 
about the object could seep out, though probably in mangled form, through 
the fluctuations in this field.
Another way to approach the problem of black hole information loss is 
through the holographic principle of Leonard Susskind and Gerard ’t Hooft, 
or the related AdS/CFT correspondence developed by Juan Maldacena. (Both 
of these principles are discussed in Chapter 11.) If these principles hold for 
black holes, it may be possible that all the information within the black hole 
is also encoded in some form on the surface area of the black hole.
	
The controversy over the black hole information paradox is described in 
detail in Susskind’s 2008 book, The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen 
Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics.
Still one other approach is to look at the potential multiverse. It’s possible that 
the information that enters a black hole is, in some way, passed from this uni­
verse into a parallel universe. I cover this intriguing possibility in Chapter 15.
The Evolution of the Universe
Other questions that scientists hope string theory can answer involve the way 
the universe changes over time. The brane world scenarios described earlier in 
this book offer some possibilities, as do the various concepts of a multiverse. 
Specifically, string theorists hope to understand the reason for the increased 
expansion of our universe as defined by dark matter and energy.
The swelling continues: Eternal inflation
Some cosmologists have worked hard on a theory called eternal inflation, 
which helps contribute to the idea of a vast multiverse of possible universes, 
each with different laws (or different solutions to the same law, to be precise). 

254
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
In eternal inflation, island universes spring up and disappear throughout the 
universe, spawned by the very quantum fluctuations of the vacuum energy 
itself. This is seen by many as further evidence for the string theory landscape 
and the application of the anthropic principle.
The inflation theory says that our universe began on a hill (or ledge) of poten­
tial vacuum energies. The universe began to roll down that hill rapidly — that 
is, our universe began expanding at an exponential rate — until we settled into 
a valley of vacuum energy. The question that eternal inflation tries to answer 
is: Why did we start on that hill?
Seemingly, the universe started with a random starting point on the spectrum 
of possible energies, so it’s only luck that we were on the hill and, in turn, 
luck that we went through the right amount of inflation to distribute mass 
and energy the way it’s distributed.
Or, alternately, there are a vast number of possibilities, many of which spring 
into existence, and we could only possibly exist in the ones that have this 
specific starting condition. (This is, in essence, the anthropic argument.)
In either case, the particles and forces of our universe are determined by the 
initial location on that hill and the laws of physics that govern how the uni­
verse will change over time.
In 1977, Sidney Coleman and Frank De Luccia described how quantum fluc­
tuations in an inflating universe create tiny bubbles in the fabric of space-
time. These bubbles can be treated as small universes in their own right (see 
Chapter 15). For now, the key is that they do form.
The cosmologist Andrei Linde has been the one to most strenuously argue 
that this finding, in combination with Alan Guth’s inflationary theory, 
demands eternal inflation — the creation of a vast population of universes, 
each with slightly different physical properties. He has been joined by Guth 
himself and Alexander Vilenkin, who helped hammer out the key aspects of 
the theory.
	
The eternal inflation model says that these bubble universes (Guth prefers 
“pocket universes,” while Susskind calls them “island universes”) spring up, 
somehow getting physical laws among the possible ones dictated by the 
string theory landscape (through some as-yet-unknown means). The bubble 
universe then undergoes inflation. Meanwhile, the space around it continues 
to expand — and it expands so quickly that information about the inflating 
bubble universe can never reach another universe. Our own universe is one 
of these bubble universes, but one which finished its inflationary period 
long ago.

255
 Chapter 14: Our Universe — String Theory, Cosmology, and Astrophysics
The hidden matter and energy
Two mysteries of our universe are the dark matter and dark energy (Chapter 9 
contains the basics about these concepts). Dark matter is unseen matter that 
holds stars together in galaxies, while dark energy is unseen vacuum energy 
that pushes different galaxies farther apart from each other. String theory 
holds several possibilities for both.
A stringy look at dark matter
String theory provides a natural candidate for dark matter in supersymmetric 
particles, which are needed to make the theory work but which scientists 
have never observed. Alternatively, it’s possible that dark matter somehow 
results from the gravitational influence of nearby branes.
Probably the simplest explanation of dark matter would be a vast sea of 
supersymmetric particles residing inside galaxies, but we can’t see them 
(presumably because of some unknown properties of these new particles). 
Supersymmetry implies that every particle science knows about has a super­
partner (see Chapter 10 if you need a refresher on supersymmetry). Fermions 
have bosonic superpartners and bosons have fermionic superpartners. In 
fact, one popular candidate for the missing dark matter is the photino, the 
superpartner of the photon.
A computer simulation, reported in the journal Nature in November 2008, 
offers one possible means of testing this idea. The simulation, performed 
by the international Virgo Consortium research group, suggests that dark 
matter in the halo of the Milky Way galaxy should produce detectable levels 
of gamma rays. This simulation indicates a direction to start looking for such 
tell-tale signs, at least.
Another possible dark matter candidate comes from the various brane world 
scenarios. Though the details still have to be worked out, it’s possible that 
there are branes that overlap with our own 3-brane. Perhaps where we have 
galaxies, there are gravitational objects that extend into other branes. Because 
gravity is the one force that can interact across the branes, it’s possible that 
these hyper-dimensional objects create added gravity within our own 3-brane.
Finally, the 4-dimensional string theories discussed in Chapter 13 present yet 
another possibility, because they require not only supersymmetry but a vast 
number of families of particles beyond the electron, muon, and tau families in 
our current Standard Model. Bringing string theory down to four dimensions 
seems to greatly expand the number of particles that physicists would expect 
to find in the universe, and (if they exist) these could account for dark matter.
A stringy look at dark energy
Even more intriguing than dark matter is dark energy, which is a positive 
energy that seems to permeate the entire universe and to be much more 

256
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
abundant than either form of matter — but also much less abundant than 
physicists think it should be. Recent discoveries in string theory have allowed 
for this dark energy to exist with in the theory.
Although string theory offers some possibilities for dark matter, it offers less 
explanation for dark energy. Theoretically, dark energy should be explained 
by the value of the vacuum energy in particle physics, where particles 
are continually created and destroyed. These quantum fluctuations grow 
immensely, leading to infinite values. (I explain in Chapter 8 that to avoid 
these infinite values in quantum field theory, the process of renormalization 
is used, which is essentially rounding the quantity to a noninfinite value. This 
wouldn’t be viewed as a favorable method, except for the fact that it works.)
	
However, when physicists try to use their standard methods to compute the 
value of the vacuum energy, they get a value that is off from the experimental 
value of dark energy by 10120!
The real value is incredibly small, but not quite zero. Though the amount of 
dark energy in the universe is vast (according to recent data, it makes up about 
73 percent of the universe), the intensity of dark energy is very small — so 
small that until 1998, scientists assumed the value was exactly zero.
The existence of dark energy (or a positive cosmological constant, depending 
on how you want to look at it) doesn’t remove the many solutions of string 
theory relating to different possible physical laws. The number of solutions 
that include dark energy may be on the order of 10500. This dark energy 
reflects a positive energy built into the very fabric of the universe, likely 
related to the energy of the vacuum itself.
To some, the ekpyrotic universe has a benefit over the inflationary model, 
because it offers a reason for why we might observe such a value for dark 
energy in our universe: That’s the part of the cyclic phase that we’re in. At 
times in the past, the dark energy may have been stronger, and at times in 
the future it may be less. To many others, this reason isn’t any more intel­
lectually satisfying than the lack of a reason in other cosmological models. It 
still amounts to an accidental coincidence (or an application of the anthropic 
principle, as discussed later in this chapter).
Outside of the ekpyrotic universe, there’s little explanation for what’s going 
on. The problem of offsetting the expected vacuum energy by such a large 
amount — enough to almost, but not quite, cancel it out — is seen by many 
physicists as too much chance to contemplate.
Many would rather turn to the anthropic principle to explain it. Others see 
that as waving a white flag of surrender, admitting that dark energy is just too 
tough of a challenge to figure out.

 Chapter 14: Our Universe — String Theory, Cosmology, and Astrophysics
The Undiscovered Country: 
The Future of the Cosmos
In cosmology, the past and the future are linked together, and the expla­
nation for one is tied to the explanation of the other. With the big bang 
model in place, there are essentially three possible futures for our universe. 
Determining the solutions to string theory that apply to our universe might 
allow us to determine which future is most likely.
A universe of ice: The big freeze
In this model of the universe’s future, the universe continues to expand for­
ever. Energy slowly dissipates across a wider and wider volume of space and, 
eventually, the result is a vast cold expanse of space as the stars die. This big 
freeze has always had some degree of popularity, dating back to the rise of 
thermodynamics in the 1800s.
The laws of thermodynamics tell you that the entropy, or disorder, in a 
system will always increase. This means that the heat will spread out. In the 
context of cosmology, this means that the stars will die and their energy will 
radiate outward. In this “heat death,” the universe becomes a static soup of 
near–absolute zero energy. The universe as a whole reaches a state of ther­
mal equilibrium, meaning that nothing interesting can really happen.
A slightly different version of the big freeze model is based on the more 
recent discovery of dark energy. In this case, the repulsive gravity of dark 
energy will cause clusters of a galaxy to move apart from each other, while, 
on the smaller scale, those clusters will gather closer together, eventually 
forming one large galaxy.
Over time, the universe will be populated by large galaxies that are extremely 
far apart from each other. The galaxies will become inhospitable to life, and 
the other galaxies will be too far away to even see. This variant, sometimes 
called a “cold death,” is another way the universe could end as a frozen 
wasteland. (This timescale is incredibly vast, and humans will likely not even 
still exist. So no need to panic.)
From point to point: The big crunch
One model for the future of the universe is that the mass density of the uni­
verse is high enough that the attractive gravity will eventually overpower the 
repulsive gravity of dark energy. In this big crunch model, the universe con­
tracts back into a microscopic point of mass.

258
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
This idea of a big crunch was a popular notion when I was in high school and 
reading science fiction, but with the discovery of the repulsive dark energy, it 
seems to have gone out of favor. Because physicists are observing the expan­
sion rate increase, it’s unlikely that there’s enough matter to overcome that 
and pull it all back together.
A new beginning: The big bounce
The ekpyrotic model (see the earlier section “A brane-fueled, 21st-century 
cyclic model: The ekpyrotic universe”) brings the big crunch back, but with 
a twist. When the crunch occurs, the universe once again goes through a 
big bang period. This is not the only model that allows for such a big bounce 
cyclic model.
In the ekpyrotic model, the universe goes through a series of big bangs, fol­
lowed by expansion and then a contracting big crunch. The cycle repeats 
over and over, presumably without any beginning or end. Cyclic models of 
the universe are not original, going back not only to 1930s physics, but also 
to religions, such as some interpretations of Hinduism.
It turns out that string theory’s major competitor — loop quantum gravity 
(explained in Chapter 18) — may also present a big bounce picture. The 
method of loop quantum gravity is to quantize (break up into discrete units) 
space-time itself, and this avoids a singularity at the formation of the uni­
verse, which means that it’s possible that time extends back before the big 
bang moment. In such a picture, a big bounce scenario is likely.
Exploring a Finely Tuned Universe
One major issue in cosmology for years has been the apparent fine-tuning 
seen in our universe. The universe seems specially crafted to allow life. One 
of the major explanations for this is the anthropic principle, which many 
string theorists have recently begun adopting. Many physicists still feel that 
the anthropic principle is a poor substitute for an explanation of why these 
physical properties must have the values they do.
To a physicist, the universe looks as if it were made for the creation of life. 
British Astronomer Royal Martin Rees clearly illuminated this situation in 
his 1999 book Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe. In 
this book, Rees points out that there are many values — the intensity of dark 
energy, gravity, electromagnetic forces, atomic binding energies, to name just 
a few — that would, if different by even an extremely small amount, result 

259
 Chapter 14: Our Universe — String Theory, Cosmology, and Astrophysics
in a universe that is inhospitable to life as we know it. (In some cases, the 
universe would have collapsed only moments after creation, resulting in a 
universe inhospitable for any form of life.)
The goal of science has always been to explain why nature has to have these 
values. This idea was once posed by Einstein’s famous question: Did God 
have a choice in creating the universe?
	
Einstein’s religious views are complex, but what he meant by this question 
wasn’t actually so much religious as scientific. In other words, he was wonder­
ing if there was a fundamental reason — buried in the laws of nature — why 
the universe turned out the way it did.
For years, scientists sought to explain the way the universe worked in terms of 
fundamental principles that dictate the way the universe has formed. However, 
with string theory (and eternal inflation), that very process has resulted in 
answers that imply the existence of a vast number of universes and a vast 
number of scientific laws, which could be applied in those universes.
The major success of the anthropic principle is that it provided one of the 
only predictions for a small, but positive, cosmological constant prior to 
the discovery of dark energy. This was put forward in the 1986 book The 
Anthropic Cosmological Principle by John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler, and 
cosmologists in the 1980s appeared to be at least open-minded about the 
possibility of using anthropic reasoning.
Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg made the big case for anthropic reasoning in 
1987. Analyzing details of how the universe formed, he realized two things:
	
✓	If the cosmological constant were negative, the universe would quickly 
collapse.
	
✓	If the cosmological constant were slightly larger than the experimentally 
possible value, matter would have been pushed apart too quickly for gal­
axies to form.
In other words, Weinberg realized that if scientists based their analysis on 
what was required to make life possible, then the cosmological constant 
couldn’t be negative and had to be very small. There was no reason, in his 
analysis, for it to be exactly zero. A little over a decade later, astronomers 
discovered dark energy, which fit the cosmological constant in precisely the 
range specified by Weinberg. Martin Rees appealed to this type of discovery 
in his explanation of how the laws in our universe end up with such finely 
tuned values, including the cosmological constant.

260
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
You may wonder if there’s anything particularly anthropic about Weinberg’s 
reasoning, however. You only have to look around to realize that the uni­
verse didn’t collapse and galaxies were able to form. It seems like this argu­
ment could be made just by observation.
The problem is that physicists are looking not only to determine the proper­
ties of our universe, but to explain them. To use this reasoning to explain the 
special status of our universe (that is, it contains us) requires something very 
important — a large number of other universes, most of which have proper­
ties that make them significantly different from us.
	
For an analogy, consider you’re driving along and get a flat tire. If you were the 
only person who had ever gotten a flat tire, you might be tempted to explain 
the reason why you, out of everyone on the planet, were the one to get the flat 
tire. Knowing that many people get flat tires every day, no further explanation 
is needed — you just happen to have been in one of many cars that happened 
to get a flat tire.
If there is only one universe, then having the fine-tuned numbers that Rees 
and others note is a miraculously fortunate turn of events. If there are billions 
of universes, each with random laws from hundreds of billions (or more) pos­
sible laws from the string theory landscape, then every once in a while a uni­
verse like ours will be created. No further explanation is necessary.
	
The problem with the anthropic principle is that it tends to be a last resort for 
physicists. Scientists only turn to the anthropic principle when more conven­
tional methods of arguments have failed them, and the second they can come 
up with a different explanation, they abandon it.
This isn’t to imply that the scientists applying the anthropic principle are 
anything but sincere. Those who adopt it seem to believe that the vast string 
theory landscape — realized in a multiverse of possible universes (see 
Chapter 15) — can be used to explain the properties of our universe.

Can Be Two Places at Once
In This Chapter
▶	Examining the four types of parallel universes
▶	Using holes and tunnels to check out other universes
▶	Explaining our universe by our presence
S
tring theory and its infant sibling, string cosmology, certainly give us 
amazing possibilities for what could be out there in our universe, but 
they also give us even more amazing possibilities about what could be out 
there beyond our universe, in other universes that may or may not have any 
connection with ours.
In this chapter, I explain what science in general, and string theory in particu­
lar, has to tell us about the possible existence of alternate universes. I start 
with a general discussion of these different types of parallel universes and 
then get into the specific traits of each. I also take a brief look at how quan­
tum physics could possibly provide a way for intelligent beings from one uni­
verse to possibly contact another universe. Finally, the anthropic principle 
comes up again, and I explain how it relates to the ideas of parallel universes.
Exploring the Multiverse: A Theory 
of Parallel Universes
The multiverse is a theory in which our universe is not the only one, but 
states that many universes exist parallel to each other. These distinct uni­
verses within the multiverse theory are called parallel universes. A variety of 
different theories lend themselves to a multiverse viewpoint.

262
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
In some theories, there are copies of you sitting right here right now read­
ing this book in other universes and other copies of you that are doing other 
things in other universes. Other theories contain parallel universes that are so 
radically different from our own that they follow entirely different fundamental 
laws of physics (or at least the same laws manifest in fundamentally different 
ways), likely collapsing or expanding so quickly that life never develops.
Not all physicists really believe that these universes exist. Even fewer believe 
that it would ever be possible to contact these parallel universes, likely not 
even in the entire span of our universe’s history. Others believe the quan­
tum physics adage that if it’s possible, it’s bound to happen somewhere and 
sometime, meaning it may be inevitable that quantum effects allow contact 
between parallel universes.
According to MIT cosmologist Max Tegmark, there are four levels of parallel 
universes:
	
✓	Level 1: An infinite universe that, by the laws of probability, must con­
tain another copy of Earth somewhere
	
✓	Level 2: Other distant regions of space with different physical param­
eters, but the same basic laws
	
✓	Level 3: Other universes where each possibility that can exist does 
exist, as described by the many worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum 
physics
Multiverses in religion and philosophy
The idea of a physical multiverse came later to 
physics than in some other areas. The Hindu 
religion has ancient concepts that are similar. 
The term itself was, apparently, first applied by 
a psychologist, rather than a physicist.
Concepts of a multiverse are evident in the 
cyclical infinite worlds of ancient Hindu cos­
mology. In this viewpoint, our world is one of 
an infinite number of distinct worlds, each gov­
erned by its own gods on their own cycles of 
creation and destruction.
The word multiverse was originated by 
American psychologist William James in 1895 
(the word “moral” is excluded from some cita­
tions of this passage):
	
	 “Visible nature is all plasticity and indiffer­
ence, a [moral] multiverse, as one might 
call it, and not a [moral] universe.”
The phrase rose in prominence throughout the 
20th century, when it was used regularly in sci­
ence fiction and fantasy, notably in the work 
of author Michael Moorcock (though some 
sources attribute the word to the earlier work 
of author and philosopher John Cowper Powys 
in the 1950s). It is now a common phrase within 
these genres.

263
 Chapter 15: Parallel Universes: Maybe You Can Be Two Places at Once
	
✓	Level 4: Entirely distinct universes that may not even be connected to 
ours in any meaningful way and very likely have entirely different funda­
mental physical laws
The following sections look at each of these levels in more detail.
	
Tegmark’s approach is one of the only attempts to comprehensively catego­
rize the concepts of parallel universes in a scientific (or, as some see it, pseu­
doscientific) context. The full text of Tegmark’s 2003 paper on this 
topic is available at his MIT Web site, space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/
multiverse.pdf, for those who don’t believe that these concepts are sci­
entific. (They may not be scientific, but if that’s the case, then at least they’re 
unscientific musings by a scientist.)
Plurality of worlds: A hot topic
Early astronomy provided some support for 
the existence of a plurality of worlds, a view 
that was so controversial that it contributed 
to at least one man’s death. These plurality of 
worlds, and the eventual parallel worlds, were 
rooted in the ideas of an infinite universe, as are 
the ideas of parallel universes presented in this 
chapter.
The Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (1548–
1600) was executed for a variety of heresies 
against the Catholic Church. Though Bruno 
was a supporter of the Copernican system, 
his abnormal beliefs went far beyond that: He 
believed in an eternal and infinite universe 
that contained a plurality of worlds. Bruno rea­
soned that because God was infinite, his cre­
ation would similarly be infinite. Each star was 
another sun, like our own, about which other 
worlds revolved. He didn’t feel that such view­
points were in opposition to the scriptures.
In fairness to the Catholic Church, Bruno 
wasn’t executed merely for believing in other 
worlds. His list of heresies was long and varied, 
including denial of Mary’s virginity, the divinity 
of Christ, the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the 
Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. He also 
believed in reincarnation and was accused of 
practicing magic. This is not to say that any (or 
all) of these viewpoints warranted death, but 
given the time period, it would be hard to get 
out of such accusations alive.
In 1686, the French writer Bernard le Bovier de 
Fontenelle wrote Conversations on the Plurality 
of Worlds, which was one of the first books 
to address the popular audience on scientific 
topics, being written in French rather than 
scholarly Latin. In Conversations, he explained 
the Copernican heliocentric model of the uni­
verse and contemplated extraterrestrial life. 
Though other enlightenment thinkers — pos­
sibly even John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, 
by some accounts — were agreeable to such 
viewpoints, it would be many years before the 
plurality of worlds extended to the plurality of 
universes.
In 1871, the French political malcontent 
Louis Auguste Blanqui wrote — while in 
prison — a brochure titled Eternity by the Stars: 
Astronomical Hypotheses, in which he said that 
an infinite universe would have to replicate the 
original set of combinations an infinite number 
of times to fill up the infinite space. This is, to 
my knowledge, the first inkling of the transition 
from “plurality of worlds” to “parallel worlds” — 
copies of you sitting reading this same book on 
another planet.

264
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
Level 1: If you go far enough, 
you’ll get back home
The idea of Level 1 parallel universes basically says that space is so big that 
the rules of probability imply that surely, somewhere else out there, are 
other planets exactly like Earth. In fact, an infinite universe would have infi­
nitely many planets, and on some of them, the events that play out would be 
virtually identical to those on our own Earth.
We don’t see these other universes because our cosmic vision is limited by 
the speed of light — the ultimate speed limit. Light started traveling at the 
moment of the big bang, about 14 billion years ago, and so we can’t see any 
further than about 14 billion light-years (a bit farther, since space is expand­
ing). This volume of space is called the Hubble volume and represents our 
observable universe.
The existence of Level 1 parallel universes depends on two assumptions:
	
✓	The universe is infinite (or virtually so).
	
✓	Within an infinite universe, every single possible configuration of par­
ticles in a Hubble volume takes place multiple times.
In regard to the first assumption, inflation theory predicts that the universe 
is actually far larger than our Hubble volume. Recall that eternal inflation 
implies that universes are constantly being created and destroyed by quan­
tum fluctuations, which means that space is actually infinite under the most 
extreme application of this theory.
The regions created in an eternal inflation model trigger every single set of 
initial conditions, leading to the second assumption. This means that there’s 
another region of space that consists of a Hubble volume that has the exact 
same initial conditions as our universe. If it has exactly the same initial condi­
tions, then such a region would evolve into a Hubble volume that resembles 
ours exactly.
If Level 1 parallel universes do exist, reaching one is virtually (but not 
entirely) impossible. For one thing, we wouldn’t know where to look for one 
because, by definition, a Level 1 parallel universe is so far away that no mes­
sage can ever get from us to them, or them to us. (Remember, we can only 
get messages from within our own Hubble volume.)
In theory, however, you could get in a spaceship that can travel at nearly 
the speed of light, point it in a direction, and head off. Time for you would 
slow, but the universe would continue to age as you moved throughout the 
entire expanse of the universe looking for your twin. If you’re lucky, and dark 
energy is weak enough that eventually gravity causes cosmic expansion to 
end, you might eventually be able to get to your twin’s planet.

265
 Chapter 15: Parallel Universes: Maybe You Can Be Two Places at Once
Level 2: If you go far enough, 
you’ll fall into wonderland
In a Level 2 parallel universe, regions of space are continuing to undergo an 
inflation phase. Because of the continuing inflationary phase in these uni­
verses, space between us and the other universes is literally expanding faster 
than the speed of light — and they are, therefore, completely unreachable.
Chaotic and eternal: Two facets of inflation
The theories of eternal inflation and chaotic 
inflation can be quite confusing, as I discovered 
in writing this book. Most people, even physi­
cists, use them fairly interchangeably. This is 
an excellent example of how concepts on the 
cutting edge of science can get blurred, even 
between different experts in the field.
In eternal inflation, the quantum fluctuations in 
the vacuum energy result in “bubble universes” 
(or “pocket universes” or “island universes” . . . 
will the naming confusion never cease?!). The 
possible energies that such a universe could 
have (called the false vacuum) are represented 
by a graph that looks kind of like a mountain 
range, which is often referred to as an energy 
hill. The true vacuum of our universe is repre­
sented as one of the valleys in such a graph.
In 1983, Paul Steinhardt and Alex Vilenkin both 
presented the key ideas of eternal inflation, 
which is that quantum fluctuations can cause 
the triggering of new inflationary cycles. The 
assumption at the time was that each new 
cycle of inflation would start at the top of the 
energy hill and, during the inflationary cycle, 
would progress down toward the true vacuum. 
The energy state of the universe is decaying 
into a ground state.
In 1986, Andrei Linde wrote a paper called 
“Chaotic Inflation,” in which he pointed out that 
these universes can be created anywhere on 
the energy hill, not necessarily at the peak. In 
fact, the hill itself may not even have a peak; 
it might continue on forever! He furthermore 
showed that chaotic inflation is also eternal, 
because it spawns continued creation of new 
bubble universes.
Several sources make chaotic inflation sound 
like a specific type of eternal inflation theory. 
Max Tegmark’s 2003 article uses “chaotic 
inflation” in a way that sounds, to me, more like 
eternal inflation. Wikipedia has an article on 
chaotic inflation, identifying it as a “sub-class 
of eternal inflation,” but has no article on eter­
nal inflation itself!
But Vilenkin, in his 2006 book, Many Worlds in 
One: The Search for Other Universes, is ada­
mant that chaotic inflation is an entirely differ­
ent theory, seeming a bit frustrated that they’re 
so often interchanged, a frustration that cer­
tainly seems justified, unless Vilenkin is the one 
who’s applying the term imprecisely.
Time will tell what consensus cosmologists 
reach over this distinction between chaotic 
inflation and eternal inflation. For now, though, 
it’s useful to know that most chaotic models will 
yield eternal inflation (but not all of them), and 
many eternal inflation models are not chaotic.

266
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
Two possible theories present reasons to believe that Level 2 parallel uni­
verses may exist: eternal inflation and ekpyrotic theory. Both theories were 
introduced in Chapter 14, but now you can see one of the consequences in 
action.
In eternal inflation, recall that the quantum fluctuations in the early uni­
verse’s vacuum energy caused bubble universes to be created all over the 
place, expanding through their inflation stages at different rates. The initial 
condition of these universes is assumed to be at a maximum energy level, 
although at least one variant, chaotic inflation, predicts that the initial condi­
tion can be chaotically chosen as any energy level, which may have no maxi­
mum, and the results will be the same. (See the nearby sidebar “Chaotic and 
eternal: Two facets of inflation” for more information.)
The findings of eternal inflation mean that when inflation starts, it produces 
not just one universe, but an infinite number of universes.
Right now, the only noninflationary model that carries any kind of weight 
is the ekpyrotic model, which is so new that it’s still highly speculative. 
(Ironically, both the eternal inflation model and the ekpyrotic model were 
partially created by cosmologist Paul Steinhardt.)
	
In the ekpyrotic theory picture, if the universe is the region that results when 
two branes collide, then the branes could actually collide in multiple loca­
tions. Consider flapping a sheet up and down rapidly onto the surface of a 
bed. The sheet doesn’t touch the bed only in one location, but rather touches 
it in multiple locations. If the sheet were a brane, then each point of collision 
would create its own universe with its own initial conditions.
There’s no reason to expect that branes collide in only one place, so the 
ekpyrotic theory makes it very probable that there are other universes in 
other locations, expanding even as you consider this possibility.
	
In other words, modern cosmology — regardless of whether inflation or ekpy­
rosis are true — virtually demands that Level 2 parallel universes exist. (Some 
alternate cosmological theories presented in Chapter 19, such as variable 
speed of light cosmology and modified gravity, don’t have this demand.)
As in the Level 1 universes, these universes would be created with essentially 
random initial conditions, which, averaged out over infinity, implies that 
there are other universes that are virtually (or completely) identical to our 
own. These new universes are continually formed, so many (infinitely many, 
in fact) are still undergoing the inflationary phase of their evolution.
Unlike in a Level 1 universe, it’s possible that a Level 2 universe could have 
different fundamental properties, such as a higher (or lower) number of 
dimensions, a different array of elementary particles, fundamental force 

267
 Chapter 15: Parallel Universes: Maybe You Can Be Two Places at Once
strengths, and so on. But these universes are created by the same laws of 
physics that created ours, just with different parameters. These universes 
could behave quite differently from our own, but the laws that govern them 
would — on a very fundamental level — be exactly the same.
Unfortunately, Level 2 universes are pretty much impossible to reach. Not 
only are there an infinite number of universes, but there are an infinite 
number of inflating universes, which means the space between our universe 
and a parallel universe is expanding. So even if we could move at the speed 
of light (and we can’t), we’d never be able to get to another universe. Space 
itself is inflating faster than we can move between our universe and another 
Level 2 universe.
Level 3: If you stay where you 
are, you’ll run into yourself
A Level 3 parallel universe is a consequence of the many worlds interpre­
tation (MWI) from quantum physics. In this interpretation, every single 
quantum possibility inherent in the quantum wavefunction becomes a real 
possibility in some reality. When the average person (especially a science 
fiction fan) thinks of a “parallel universe,” he’s probably thinking of Level 3 
parallel universes.
The many worlds interpretation was presented by Hugh Everett III to explain 
the quantum wavefunction, the Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equa­
tion describes how a quantum system evolves over time through a series of 
rotations in a Hilbert space (an abstract space with infinite dimensions). The 
evolution of the wavefunction is called unitary. (Unitarity basically means 
that if you add up the probabilities of all possible outcomes, you get 1 as the 
sum of those probabilities.)
The traditional Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics assumed that 
the wavefunction collapsed into a specific state, but the theory presented no 
mechanism for when or how this collapse takes place. The collapse turned 
the unitary wavefunction, which contains all possibilities, into a non-unitary 
system, which ignores the possibilities that never took place.
Everett took a tactic similar to that taken later by string theorists, assum­
ing that each “dimension” predicted mathematically by the wavefunction 
(an infinite number of them) must be realized in some way in reality. In this 
theory, all quantum events result in a branching of a universe into multiple 
universes, so the unitary theory can be treated in a unitary way (no possibili­
ties ever go away).

268
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
Level 3 parallel universes are different from the others posed because they 
take place in the same space and time as our own universe, but you still have 
no way to access them. You have never had and will never have contact with 
any Level 1 or Level 2 universe (I assume), but you’re continually in contact 
with Level 3 universes — every moment of your life, every decision you 
make, is causing a split of your “now” self into an infinite number of future 
selves, all of which are unaware of each other.
	
Though we talk of the universe “splitting,” this isn’t precisely true (under 
the MWI of quantum physics). From a mathematical standpoint, there’s only 
one wavefunction, and it evolves over time. The superpositions of different 
universes all coexist simultaneously in the same infinite-dimensional Hilbert 
space. These separate, coexisting universes interfere with each other, yielding 
the bizarre quantum behaviors, such as those of the double slit experiment in 
Chapter 7.
Of the four types of universes, Level 3 parallel universes have the least to do 
with string theory directly.
Alternate history across many worlds
Of all the types of parallel universes, Level 3 
universes have most captured the imagination 
of popular culture, spawning their own genre 
of science fiction and fantasy: alternate his­
tory. These are stories written with settings 
that are based on our own universe, but with 
the assumption that some historical event went 
differently, resulting in consequences different 
from those in our own universe. (For the non-
science fiction fan, think of It’s a Wonderful 
Life.) In these fictional universes, it’s possible 
(and common) that visitors from one universe 
can interact with a Level 3 parallel universe.
Obviously, in these fictional universes, the 
author (and reader) care about the macroscopic 
differences, but the many worlds interpretation 
applies to all levels. If a particle decays, or not, 
different worlds represent those events. No one 
observing would be able to tell the difference 
between them. However, if they were observing 
with a Geiger counter, which detects radioac­
tive decay, the quantum split would result in 
further splits. The Geiger counter is triggered 
in one universe and not the other. The scientist 
who detects the decay would react differently, 
perhaps, than the one who does not detect the 
decay. So, in principle, this is how these tiny 
quantum universes become full-fledged paral­
lel universes.
In fiction, the effects are generally more dra­
matic, such as the southern states winning the 
American Civil War or the Byzantine Empire 
never collapsing (both of which have been 
explored by alternate history author Harry 
Turtledove, called “the Master of Alternate 
History” by his fans).

269
 Chapter 15: Parallel Universes: Maybe You Can Be Two Places at Once
Level 4: Somewhere over the rainbow, 
there’s a magical land
A Level 4 parallel universe is the strangest place (and most controversial pre­
diction) of all, because it would follow fundamentally different mathematical 
laws of nature than our universe. In short, any universe that physicists can 
get to work out on paper would exist, based on the mathematical democracy 
principle: Any universe that is mathematically possible has equal possibility 
of actually existing.
Scientists use mathematics as their primary tool to express the theories of 
how nature behaves. In a sense, the mathematics that represents the theory 
is the meat of the theory, the thing that really gives it substance.
In 1960, physicist Eugene Wigner published an article with the provocative 
title “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences,” 
in which he pointed out that it’s kind of unreasonable that mathematics — a 
construct purely of the mind — would be so good at describing physical laws. 
He went further than this, supposing that this effectiveness represented a deep 
level of connection between mathematics and physics, and that by exploring 
mathematics you can figure out ways to approach sciences in new and innova­
tive ways.
But the equations that work so well to describe our universe are only one set 
of equations. Certainly a universe could be created, as physicists have done 
on paper, with only two dimensions and containing no matter, which is noth­
ing but expanding space. There could be a vast anti-de Sitter space, contract­
ing, right next to it.
Why, then, do we observe the specific set of equations, specific set of laws, 
that we do? In other words, to use the phrase of British cosmologist Stephen 
Hawking (from his 1988 A Brief History of Time), what is the force that 
“breathes fire into the equations” that govern our universe?
Throughout this book, you explore concepts that are on the cutting edge of 
theoretical physics — the bosonic string theory, the various superstring the­
ories, AdS/CFT correspondence, Randall-Sundrum models — but that clearly 
don’t match our own universe. Most physicists leave it at that, with the 
understanding that some “pure math” just doesn’t apply directly to the physi­
cal universe we live in. However, according to the principle of mathematical 
democracy, these universes do exist somewhere.

In this controversial view, our equations aren’t preferred, but in the multi­
verse, every equation that can have life breathed into it will. This makes up 
the Level 4 multiverse, a place so vast and strange that even the most brilliant 
among us can only conceptualize it with the tools of mathematics.
Accessing Other Universes
With the four types of parallel universe described, it’s time to look at the fun 
part — whether there’s any way to reach them. Realistically, the answer is 
probably “No,” but that’s not the most interesting option, so the following 
sections look into ways that some of these universes might be able to inter­
act with our own.
A history of hyperspace
To access a Level 1, 2, or 4 universe, you’d have to find a way to traverse an 
incredibly large distance in a moment’s time, a task made more difficult by 
Einstein’s speed limit — the speed of light. One of the only ways to achieve this 
would be by using extra space dimensions — sometimes called hyperspace — 
to cut down the distance.
Where are those extra dimensions, anyway?
Current string theory models postulate ten space dimensions (plus one time 
dimension). Our observed universe appears to have only three space dimen­
sions (plus the one time dimension). String theory offers two possibilities for 
the extra dimensions:
	
✓	The extra seven dimensions extend off of a 3-brane on which our uni­
verse resides.
	
✓	The extra seven dimensions are compactified (likely into a Planck length 
radius shape), while our three space dimensions are uncompactified. 
(This is the dominant string theory viewpoint.)
You can picture a modified version of the first possibility by looking at 
Figure 15-1, which shows a universe of people living on a 2-brane. A third 
dimension extends off of that brane.
In theory, there could be some means for the 2-brane residents to leave the 
2-brane and experience the greater 3-dimensional reality, as in the classic 
novel Flatland. By extension, there could be a way for people in our universe 
to leave our 3-brane to travel in the extra dimensions.

271
 Chapter 15: Parallel Universes: Maybe You Can Be Two Places at Once
	
Figure 15-1: 
It’s pos-
sible that 
there are 
dimensions 
beyond our 
own, which 
we can’t 
access.
	
For the second possibility, the dimensions are compactified to sizes that are 
so small no one has ever observed them. As discussed in Chapter 11, some 
recent theories have indicated that these sizes could be as large as a visible 
fraction of a millimeter, and tests along these lines should take place at the 
Large Hadron Collider. Some speculative ideas (not even well developed 
enough to be called theories) have been put forth that these compactified 
dimensions could contain their own universes.
String theory also allows for the possibility that some regions of the universe 
would have large extra dimensions, allowing them to interact with the cur­
rent three dimensions in meaningful ways. No models suggest that this is 
actually happening in our universe, but the theory allows for such behavior.
Wormholes: Busting out of three-space
Even before string theory, the idea existed that the geometry of the universe 
would allow for shorter paths between points. In fiction, this can be seen in 
stories such as Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, and in science, it can be 
seen in the wormholes, as depicted in Figure 1-4 in Chapter 1.
A wormhole is a shortcut to go from one location on a surface to another, 
just as a worm can dig through the center of an apple to get from one surface 
to another (thus the name). This concept arises from Einstein’s theory of 
general relativity, proposed years before string theory was conceived. These 
traditional wormholes connect different regions in the same universe and, as 
you can see in Chapter 16, have been exploited for many outlandish theoreti­
cal purposes, despite the fact that no one knows for sure whether they exist. 
(So what’s one more!)

272
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
Similarly, it’s possible that in a brane world scenario, we are somehow touch­
ing or connected to another brane. If these branes overlap, it’s conceivable 
that there would be a way to travel from the space of one brane to the space 
of another brane. (This is not the standard way that multiple branes interact 
in string theory. Much more common are the brane world scenarios from 
Chapter 11, where separate branes host difference pieces of the physics of 
our universe and then interact gravitationally.)
It’s unlikely that such a brane jump would take place merely by stepping into 
a mirror, but something as powerful as a wormhole might do the trick. It’s 
possible that a wormhole — generally hypothesized by general relativity as 
existing within rotating black holes and being notoriously unstable — might 
allow bits of matter or energy to slip from one universe into another parallel 
universe. If such strange events occurred at points where different branes 
overlapped in the bulk (the greater space that contains all of the branes), it’s 
unclear whether they might provide a way to get matter and energy from one 
brane to another as well.
In fact, one possible resolution to the black hole information paradox that 
has long been considered by some is the idea that information that enters a 
black hole exits into a parallel universe by means of a wormhole at the center 
of the black hole.
Such ideas are obviously highly speculative, but mathematical models have 
shown it’s feasible that some sort of wormhole — if held open by a form of 
negative energy — could provide a means of connecting different portions 
of space.
If this is the case, then the arguments in favor of parallel universes are on our 
side, because given an infinite universe and infinite time, everything is bound 
to happen somewhere. In a universe where parallel universes exist, travel 
between them may be guaranteed.
How quantum mechanics can 
get us from here to there
One other process of getting from one universe to another would be to use 
the property of quantum tunneling, which is where a particle is allowed to 
“jump” from one location to another across a barrier.
As Chapter 7 reveals, the uncertainty principle of quantum physics means 
that particles don’t have a definite location, but instead both the location and 
momentum of each particle are linked together with a sort of “fuzziness.” The 
more precisely you determine the location, the more fuzzy the momentum is, 
and vice versa.

273
 Chapter 15: Parallel Universes: Maybe You Can Be Two Places at Once
This principle results in a strange phenomenon, known as quantum tunneling 
and shown in Figure 15-2. In this case, there is some sort of barrier (usually 
a potential energy barrier) that the particle shouldn’t be able to cross nor­
mally. But the graph, which represents the probability that the particle is in 
any given location, extends a bit across the barrier.

to quantum 
physics,

Probability that

In other words, even when there’s an uncrossable barrier, there’s a slight 
chance — according to quantum mechanics — that a particle that should be 
on one side of the barrier may end up on the other side of the barrier. This 
behavior has been confirmed by experiment.
This provides a means that could in theory be used to access a parallel uni­
verse. Some cosmologists have suggested that exactly this physical mecha­
nism is what started our own expansion as a universe.
The idea of quantum tunneling is key to the operation of electron-tunneling 
microscopes, which allow scientists to observe objects in incredibly fine 
detail.
Particles can only tunnel from a higher energy state into a lower energy state, 
though, so there are some limits on how this could be used, and the idea of 
using it to access another universe in a controlled way is way beyond current 
technology (or even current theory).
But for a sufficiently advanced civilization, one that has a theory that fully 
explains all aspects of physics and the ability to use vast amounts of energy, 
this sort of idea may be a possible means of getting to another universe.

274
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
Eaten by rogue universes
The assumption in this chapter has mostly 
been that the separate universes described 
don’t normally interact with each other, but 
some approaches over the years have called 
this into question. One of the most recent is 
a 2008 paper in the journal Physics Review D 
by Eduardo Guendelman and Nobuyuki Sakai, 
in which they examine the idea of bubble uni­
verses to see if they could expand without the 
need for a big bang.
To make the equations work, Guendelman and 
Sakai had to introduce a repulsive phantom 
energy, which is possibly similar to dark energy. 
They found two types of stable solutions:
	✓	The child universe, which is isolated from 
the parent universe (essentially a universe 
inside a black hole)
	✓	A rogue universe, which is not isolated from 
the parent universe
This second kind of universe is troublesome, 
because as it begins to go through its inflation 
cycle, it does so by devouring the space-time 
of the parent universe. The parent universe is 
swept away as the rogue universe expands in 
its place — and it does so faster than the speed 
of light, so there’s no warning.
Fortunately, there’s no evidence that this phan­
tom energy actually exists, or, if it does, it’s pos­
sible that it exists in the form of dark energy (or 
inflation energy), which means that we may be 
one of these rogue universes ourselves. As our 
universe expands, it may be devouring some 
other, larger universe!

O
ne of the most fascinating concepts in science fiction is the idea of trav­
eling forward or backward in time, as in H. G. Wells’s classic story The 
Time Machine. Scientists haven’t been able to build a time machine yet, but 
some physicists believe that it may someday be possible — and some (prob­
ably most) believe that it will never be possible.
Time travel exists in physics because of possible solutions to Einstein’s gen­
eral theory of relativity, mostly resulting in singularities. These singularities 
would be eliminated by string theory, so in a universe where string theory 
dictates the laws of the universe, time travel will probably not be allowed — 
a result that many physicists find quite favorable to the alternative (though 
far less interesting).
In this chapter, I explore the notion of time and our travel through it — both 
in the normal, day-to-day method and in more unusual, speculative methods. 
I discuss the scientific meaning of time, in both classical terms and from the 
standpoint of special relativity. One possible method of time travel involves 
using cosmic strings. There’s a possibility, which I explore, that there may 
be more than one time dimension. I also explain one scenario for creating a 
physically plausible (though probably impossible) time machine using worm­
holes. Finally, I look at some of the different logical paradoxes involved with 
time travel.

Temporal Mechanics 101: 
How Time Flies
We move through time every single day, and most of us don’t even think 
about how fascinating it is. Scientists who have thought about it have con­
stantly run into trouble in figuring out exactly what time means because time 
is such an abstract concept. It’s something we’re intimately familiar with, but 
so familiar with that we almost never have to analyze it in a meaningful way.
Over the years, our view of time — both individually and from a scientific 
standpoint — has changed dramatically, from an intuition about the passage 
of events to a fundamental component of the mathematical geometry that 
describes the universe.
The arrow of time: A one-way ticket
Physicists refer to the one-way motion through time (into the future and never 
the past) using the phrase “arrow of time,” first used by Arthur Eddington 
(the guy who helped confirm general relativity) in his 1928 book The Nature 
of the Physical World. The first note he makes is that “time’s arrow” points in 
one direction, as opposed to directions in space, where you can reorient as 
needed. He then points out three key ideas about the arrow of time:
	
✓	Human consciousness inherently recognizes the direction of time.
	
✓	Even without memory, the world only makes sense if the arrow of time 
points into the future.
	
✓	In physics, the only place the direction of time shows up is in the 
behavior of a large number of particles, in the form of the second law 
of thermodynamics. (See the nearby sidebar, “Time asymmetries,” for a 
clarification of the exceptions to this.)
The conscious recognition of time is the first (and most significant) evidence 
that any of us has about the direction we travel in time. Our minds (along 
with the rest of us) “move” sequentially in one direction through time, and 
most definitely not in the other. The neural pathways form in our brain, 
which retains this record of events. In our minds, the past and future are 
distinctly different. The past is static and unchanging, but the future is fully 
undetermined (at least so far as our brain knows).
As Eddington pointed out, even if you didn’t retain any sort of memory, logic 
would dictate that the past must have happened before the future. This is 
probably true, although whether one could conceptualize of a universe in 
which time flowed from the future to the past is a question that’s open for 
debate.

277
 Chapter 16: Have Time, Will Travel
Finally, though, we reach the physics of the situation: the second law of 
thermodynamics. According to this law, as time progresses, no closed system 
(that is, a system that isn’t gaining energy from outside of the system) can 
lose entropy (disorder) as time progresses. In other words, as time goes on, 
it’s not possible for a closed system to become more orderly.
	
Intuitively, this is certainly the case. If you look at a house that’s been aban­
doned, it will grow disordered over time. For it to become more orderly, there 
has to be an introduction of work from outside the system. Someone has to 
mow the yard, clean the gutters, paint the walls, and so on. (This analogy isn’t 
perfect, because even the abandoned house gets energy and influence from 
outside — sunlight, animals, rainfall, and so on — but you get the idea.)
	
In physics, the arrow in time is the direction in which entropy (disorder) 
increases. It’s the direction of decay.
Time asymmetries
Arthur Eddington’s third observation about 
the arrow of time indicates that physical laws 
actually ignore the direction of time, except 
for the second law of thermodynamics. What 
this means is that if you take the time t in any 
physics equation and replace it with a time –t, 
and then perform the calculations to describe 
what takes place, you’ll end up with a result that 
makes sense.
For gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong 
nuclear force, changing the sign on the time 
variable (called T-symmetry) allows the laws of 
physics to work perfectly well. In some special 
cases related to the weak nuclear force, this 
actually turns out not to be the case.
There is actually a larger type of symmetry, called 
CPT symmetry, which is always preserved. The C 
stands for charge-conjugation symmetry, which 
means that positive and negative charges switch. 
The P stands for parity symmetry, which involves 
basically replacing a particle for a complete 
mirror image — a particle that has been flipped 
across all three space dimensions. (This CPT 
symmetry is a property of quantum theory in our 
four-dimensional space-time, so at present we 
are ignoring the other six dimensions proposed 
by string theory.)
The total CPT symmetry, it turns out, appears to 
be preserved in nature. (This is one of the few 
cases of unbroken symmetry in our universe.) 
In other words, an exact mirror image of our 
universe — one with all matter swapped for 
antimatter, reflected in all spatial directions, 
and traveling backward in time — would obey 
physical laws that are identical to those of our 
own universe in every conceivable way.
If CP symmetry is violated, then there must be a 
corresponding break in T-symmetry, so the total 
CPT symmetry is preserved. In fact, the handful 
of processes that violate T-symmetry are called 
CP violations (because the CP violation is easier 
to test than a violation in the time-reversal 
symmetry).

278
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
Oddly, these same ideas (the same in spirit, though not scientific) date all 
the way back to St. Augustine of Alexandria’s Confessions, written in 400 BCE, 
where he said:
“What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one 
that asketh, I know not: yet I say boldly that I know, that if nothing passed 
away, time were not; and if nothing were, time present were not.”
What Augustine is pointing out here is the inherent problem in explaining 
the slippery nature of time. We know exactly what time is — in fact, we are 
unable not to understand how it flows in our own lives — but when we try to 
define it in precise terms, it eludes us. He speaks of “if nothing passed away, 
time were not” that could, in a sense, describe how the second law of thermo­
dynamics defines time’s arrow. We know time passes because things change 
in a certain way as time passes.
Relativity, worldlines, and worldsheets: 
Moving through space-time
Understanding how time travel works within string theory would require a 
complete understanding of how the fabric of space-time behaves within the 
theory. So far, string theory hasn’t exactly figured that out.
In general relativity, the motion of objects through space-time is described 
by a worldline. In string theory, scientists talk about strings (and branes) cre­
ating entire worldsheets as they move through space-time.
Worldlines were originally constructed by Hermann Minkowski when he cre­
ated his Minkowski diagrams, shown in Chapter 6. Similar diagrams return 
in the form of Feynman diagrams (see Chapter 8), which demonstrate the 
worldlines of particles as they interact with each other through the exchange 
of gauge bosons.
In string theory, instead of the straight worldlines of point particles, it is the 
movement of strings through space-time that interests scientists, as shown in 
the right side of Figure 16-1.
	
Notice that in the original Feynman diagram, shown on the left of Figure 16-1, 
there are sharp points where the worldlines intersect (representing the point 
where the particles interact). In the worldsheet, the virtual string exchanged 
between the two original strings creates a smooth curve that has no sharp 
points. This equates to the fact that string theory contains no infinities in 
the description of this interaction, as opposed to pure quantum field theory. 
(Removing the infinities in quantum field theory requires renormalization.)

One problem with both quantum field theory and string theory is that they 
are constructed in a way that gets placed inside the space-time coordinate 
system. General relativity, on the other hand, depicts a universe in which the 
space-time is dynamic. String theorists hope string theory will solve this con­
flict between the background-dependent quantum field theory and the back­
ground-independent general relativity so that eventually dynamic space-time 
will be derived out of string theory. One criticism (as discussed in Chapter 17) 
is that string theory is, at present, still background-dependent.
The competing theory, loop quantum gravity, incorporates space into the 
theory, but is still mounted on a background of time coordinates. Loop quan­
tum gravity is covered in more detail in Chapter 18.
Hawking’s chronology protection 
conjecture: You’re not going 
anywhere
The concept of time travel is often closely tied to infinities in the curvature 
of space-time, such as that within black holes. In fact, the discoveries of 
mathematically possible time travel were found in the general relativity equa­
tions containing extreme space-time curvature. Stephen Hawking, one of the 
most renowned experts in looking at space-time curvature, believes that time 
travel is impossible and has proposed a chronology protection conjecture that 
some mechanism must exist to prevent time travel.

280
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
When black holes were first proposed as solutions to Einstein’s field equations, 
neither Einstein nor Eddington believed they were real. In a speech to a Royal 
Astronomical Society, Eddington said of black hole formation, “I think there 
should be a law of nature to prevent a star from behaving in this absurd way!”
Although Hawking is certainly comfortable with the idea of black holes, he 
objects to the idea of time travel. He proposed his chronology protection 
conjecture, which states that there must be something in the universe that 
prevents time travel.
Hawking’s sometimes collaborator, Oxford physicist Roger Penrose, made 
the much more guarded claim that all singularities would be protected by 
an event horizon, which would shield them from direct interaction with our 
normal space-time, known as the cosmic censorship conjecture. This would 
also potentially prevent many forms of time travel from being accessible to 
the universe at large.
One major reason time travel causes so much trouble for physics (and must 
therefore be prohibited, according to Einstein and Hawking) is that you could 
create a way of generating an infinite amount of energy. Say you had a portal 
into the past and shone a laser into it. You set up mirrors so the light coming 
out of the portal is deflected back around to go into the portal again, in 
tandem with the original beam you have set up.
Now the total intensity of light coming out of the portal (in the past) would 
be (or have been) twice the original laser light going in. This laser light is 
sent back through the portal, yielding an output of four times as much light 
as originally transmitted. This process could be continued, resulting in liter­
ally an infinite amount of energy created instantaneously.
Obviously, such a situation is just one of many examples why physicists tend 
to doubt the possibility of time travel (with a few notable exceptions, which 
I cover throughout this chapter). If time travel were possible, then the pre­
dictive power of physics is lost, because the initial conditions are no longer 
trustworthy! The predictions based on those conditions would, therefore, be 
completely meaningless.
Slowing Time to a Standstill 
with Relativity
In physics, time travel is closely linked to Einstein’s theory of relativity, 
which allows motion in space to actually alter the flow of time. This effect is 
known as time dilation and was one of the earliest predictions of relativity. 
This sort of time travel is completely allowed by the known laws of physics, 
but it allows only travel into the future, not into the past.

281
 Chapter 16: Have Time, Will Travel
In this section I explore the special cases in relativity that imply that time 
travel — or at least altered motion through time — may in fact be possible. 
Skip ahead to “General Relativity and Wormholes: Doorways in Space and 
Time” for more information about how the general theory of relativity relates 
to potential time travel.
	
Time dilation and black hole event horizons, both of which I explain in the 
following sections, provide intriguing ways of extending human life, and in sci­
ence fiction they’ve long provided the means for allowing humans to live long 
enough to travel from star to star. (See the later sidebar “The science fiction of 
time” for more information on this.)
Time dilation: Sometimes even 
the best watches run slow
The most evident case of time acting oddly in relativity, and one that has 
been experimentally verified, is the concept of time dilation under special 
relativity. Time dilation is the idea that as you move through space, time 
itself is measured differently for the moving object than the unmoving object. 
For motion that is near the speed of light, this effect is noticeable and allows 
a way to travel into the future faster than we normally do.
One experiment that confirms this strange behavior is based on unstable 
particles, pions and muons. Physicists know how quickly the particles would 
decay if they were sitting still, but when they bombard Earth in the form of 
cosmic rays, they’re moving very quickly. Their decay rates don’t match the 
predictions, but if you apply special relativity and consider the time from the 
particle’s point of view, the time comes out as expected.
In fact, time dilation is confirmed by a number of experiments. In the Hafele-
Keating experiments of 1971, atomic clocks (which are very precise) were 
flown on airplanes traveling in opposite directions. The time differences 
shown on the clocks, as a result of their relative motion, precisely matched 
the predictions from relativity. Also, global positioning system (GPS) satel­
lites have to compensate for this time dilation to function properly. So time 
dilation is on very solid scientific ground.
	
Time dilation leads to one popular form of time travel. If you were to get into 
a spaceship that traveled very quickly away from Earth, time inside the ship 
would slow down in comparison to that on Earth. You could do a flyby of a 
nearby star and return to Earth at nearly the speed of light, and a few years 
would pass on Earth while possibly only a few weeks or months would pass 
for you, depending on how fast you were going and how far away the star was.
The biggest problem with this is how to accelerate a ship up to those speeds. 
Scientists and science fiction authors have made various proposals for such 

282
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
devices, but all are well outside the range of what we could feasibly build 
today or in the foreseeable future.
	
As you accelerate an object to high speeds, its mass also increases, which 
means it takes more and more energy to keep accelerating it. This formula of 
mass increase is similar to the formula that describes time dilation, so this 
makes it fundamentally difficult to get significant levels of time dilation.
The question is how much time dilation you really need, though, especially 
for trips within only a few light-years of Earth. One strange potential byprod­
uct of this form of time travel is described toward the end of this chapter in 
the section entitled “The twin paradox.”
Black hole event horizons: An extra-slow 
version of slow motion
One other case where time slows down, this time in general relativity, involves 
black holes. Recall that a black hole bends space-time itself, to the point where 
even light can’t escape. This bending of space-time means that as you approach 
a black hole, time will slow down for you relative to the outside world.
If you were approaching the black hole and I were far away watching (and 
could somehow watch “instantly,” without worrying about the time lag from 
light speed), I would see you approach the black hole, slow down and eventu­
ally come to rest to hover outside of it. Through the window of your space­
ship, I would see you sitting absolutely still.
You, on the other hand, would not notice anything in particular — at least 
until the intense gravity of the black hole killed you. But until then, it certainly 
wouldn’t “feel” like time was moving differently. You’d have no idea that as you 
glide past the black hole’s event horizon (which you possibly wouldn’t even 
notice), thousands of years were passing outside of the black hole.
As you find out in the next section, some believe that black holes may actu­
ally provide a means to more impressive forms of time travel as well.
General Relativity and Wormholes: 
Doorways in Space and Time
In general relativity, the fabric of space-time can occasionally allow for world­
lines that create a closed timelike curve, which is relativity-speak for time 
travel. Einstein himself explored these concepts when developing general 

283
 Chapter 16: Have Time, Will Travel
relativity, but never made much progress on them. In the following years, 
solutions allowing for time travel were discovered.
The first application of general relativity to time travel was by the Scottish 
physicist W. J. van Stockum in 1937. Van Stockum imagined (in mathemati­
cal form, because that’s how physicists imagine things) an infinitely long, 
extremely dense rotating cylinder, like an endless barbershop pole. It turns 
out that in this case, the dense cylinder actually drags space-time with it, cre­
ating a space-time whirlpool.
	
This space-time whirlpool is an example of a phenomenon called frame drag­
ging. It takes place when an object “drags” space (and time) along with it. This 
frame dragging is in addition to the normal bending of space-time due to grav­
ity and is due to the movement of incredibly dense objects in space, such as 
neutron stars. This is similar to how an electric mixer causes the surrounding 
cake batter to swirl. This effect is frequently exploited to come up with time-
travel solutions.
In van Stockum’s situation, you could fly up to the cylinder in a spaceship 
and set a course around the cylinder and arrive back at a point in time before 
you arrived at the cylinder. In other words, you can travel into the past along 
a closed timelike curve. (If you can’t picture this path, don’t feel bad. The 
path is in four dimensions, after all, and results in going backward in time, so 
it’s clearly something our brains didn’t evolve to picture.)
Another theory about time travel was proposed in 1949 by Einstein’s colleague 
and friend at Princeton University’s Institute for Advanced Study, the mathemati­
cian Kurt Gödel. Gödel considered the situation where all of space — the entire 
universe itself — was actually rotating. You might ask if everything is rotating 
how we’d ever know it. Well, it turns out that if the universe were rotating, 
according to general relativity, then we’d see laser beams curve slightly as they 
move through space (beyond the normal gravitational lensing, where gravity 
bends light beams).
The solution that Gödel arrived at was disturbing, because it allowed time 
travel. It was possible to create a path in a rotating universe that ended 
before it began. In Gödel’s rotating universe, the universe itself could func­
tion as a time machine.
	
So far, physicists haven’t found any conclusive evidence that our universe is 
rotating. In fact, the evidence points overwhelmingly toward the idea that it’s 
not. But even if the universe as a whole doesn’t rotate, objects in it certainly do.

Taking a shortcut through space and time 
with a wormhole
In a solution called an Einstein-Rosen bridge (shown in Figure 16-2 and more 
commonly called a wormhole), two points in space-time could be connected 
by a shortened path. In some special cases, a wormhole may actually allow 
for time travel. Instead of connecting different regions of space, the worm­
hole could connect different regions of time!
	
Figure 16-2: 
Traveling 
into a worm-
hole could

location in 
space-time 
to another.
	
Wormholes were studied by Albert Einstein and his pupil Nathan Rosen in 
1935. (Ludwig Flamm had first proposed them in 1916.) In this model, the 
singularity at the center of a black hole is connected to another singularity, 
which results in a theoretical object called a white hole.
	
While the black hole draws matter into it, a white hole spits matter out. 
Mathematically, a white hole is a time-reversed black hole. Because no one’s 
ever witnessed a white hole, it’s probable that they don’t exist, but they are 
allowed by the equations of general relativity and haven’t been completely 
ruled out yet.
An object falling into a black hole could travel through the wormhole and 
come out the white hole on the other side in another region of space. Einstein 
showed that there were two flaws with using a wormhole for time travel:

285
 Chapter 16: Have Time, Will Travel
	
✓	A wormhole is so unstable that it would collapse in upon itself almost 
instantaneously.
	
✓	Any object going into a black hole would be ripped apart by the intense 
gravitational force inside the black hole and would never make it out the 
other side.
Then, in 1963, New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr calculated an exact solu­
tion for Einstein’s field equations representing a Kerr black hole. The special 
feature of a Kerr black hole is that it rotates. So far as scientists know, all 
objects in the universe rotate, including stars, so when the star collapses into 
a black hole, it’s likely that it too will rotate.
In Kerr’s solution, it’s actually possible to travel through the rotating black 
hole and miss the singularity at the center, so you could come out the other 
side. The problem is, again, that the black hole would probably collapse as 
you’re going through it. (I address this problem in the next section.)
Assuming physicists could get a wormhole to be large and stable enough 
to pass through, probably the simplest time machine that could use 
this method was theorized by Kip Thorne of the California Institute of 
Technology. Consider a wormhole with the following features:
	
✓	One end of the wormhole is on Earth.
	
✓	The other end of the wormhole is located inside a spaceship, currently 
at rest on Earth. The end in the spaceship moves when the spaceship 
moves.
	
✓	You can travel through the wormhole either way, or talk through it, and 
such travel or communication is essentially instantaneous.
Now assume that a pair of twins, named Maggie and Emily, are standing at 
either end of the wormhole. Maggie is next to the wormhole on Earth in 2009, 
while Emily is on the spaceship (also, for the moment, in 2009). She goes on a 
little jaunt for a few days, traveling at nearly the speed of light, but when she 
comes back, thousands of years have passed on Earth due to time dilation 
(she is now in 5909).
On Maggie’s side of the wormhole (still 2009), only a few days have passed. 
In fact, the twins have regularly been discussing the strange sights that Emily 
has witnessed over the few days of her journey. Emily (in 5909) is able to go 
through the wormhole to Maggie’s location (in 2009) and, voilà, she has trav­
eled back in time thousands of years!
In fact, now that Emily’s gone to the trouble of setting up the portal, Maggie 
(or anyone else) could just as easily travel from 2009 to 5909 (or vice versa) 
just by stepping through it.

286
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
	
Since Thorne’s model, there have been several wormhole-based time travel 
scenarios developed by physicists. In fact, some physicists have shown that if 
a wormhole exists, it has to allow travel in time as well as space.
Overcoming a wormhole’s instability 
with negative energy
The problem with using wormholes to travel in space or time is that they are 
inherently unstable. When a particle enters a wormhole, it creates fluctua­
tions that cause the structure to collapse in upon itself. There are theories 
that a wormhole could be held open by some form of negative energy, which 
represents a case where the energy density (energy per volume) of space is 
actually negative.
Under these theories, if a sufficient quantity of negative energy could be 
employed, it might continue to hold the wormhole open while objects pass 
through it. This would be an absolute necessity for any of the previously 
discussed theories that allow a wormhole to become a time portal, but 
scientists lack a real understanding of how to get enough negative energy 
together, and most think it’s an impossible task.
In some models, it may be possible to relate dark energy and negative energy 
(both exhibit a form of repulsive gravity, even though dark energy is a posi­
tive energy), but these models are highly contrived. The good news (if you 
see possible time travel as good news) is that our universe appears to have 
dark energy in abundance, although the problem is that it looks like it’s 
evenly distributed throughout the universe.
Trying to find any way to store negative energy and use it to sustain a worm­
hole’s stability is far beyond current technology (if it’s even possible at all). 
String theory can provide potential sources of negative energy, but even in 
these cases, there’s no guarantee stable wormholes can occur.
Crossing Cosmic Strings 
to Allow Time Travel
Cosmic strings are theoretical objects that predate string theory, but in 
recent years there’s been some speculation that they may actually be 
enlarged strings left over from the big bang, or possibly the result of branes 
colliding. There has also been speculation that they can be used to create a 
time machine.

287
 Chapter 16: Have Time, Will Travel
Regardless of their origin, if cosmic strings exist, they should have an 
immense amount of gravitational pull, and this means that they can cause 
frame dragging. In 1991, J. Richard Gott (who, with William Hiscock, solved 
Einstein’s field equations for cosmic strings in 1985) realized that two cosmic 
strings could actually allow time travel.
The way this works is that two cosmic strings cross paths with each other in 
a certain way, moving at very high speeds. A spaceship traveling along the 
curves could take a very precise path (several of which were worked out by 
Curt Cutler in the months after Gott’s publication) and arrive at its starting 
position, in both space and time, allowing for travel in time. Like other time 
machines, the spaceship couldn’t travel further back than when the cosmic 
strings originally got in position to allow the travel — in essence, the time 
travel is limited to when the cosmic string time machine was activated.
Gott’s was the second time machine (following Kip Thorne’s) to have been 
published in a major journal in the early 1990s, and it sparked a wave of work 
in the area. In May 1991, Gott was featured in Time magazine. In the summer 
of 1992, physicists held a conference on time travel at the Aspen Center for 
Physics (the same place where, nearly a decade earlier, John Schwartz and 
Michael Green had determined that string theory could be consistent).
When Gott proposed this model, cosmic strings were believed to have noth­
ing to do with string theory. In recent years, physicists have grown to believe 
that cosmic strings, if they exist, may actually be very closely related to 
string theory.
A Two-Timing Science: String Theory 
Makes More Time Dimensions Possible
Because relativity showed time as one dimension of space-time and string 
theory predicts extra space dimensions, a natural question would be whether 
string theory also predicts (or at least allows for) extra time dimensions. 
According to physicist Itzhak Bars, this may actually be the case, in a field 
he calls two-time physics. Though still a marginal approach to string theory, 
understanding this potential extra dimension of time could lead to amazing 
insights into the nature of time.
Adding a new time dimension
With one time dimension, you have the arrow of time, but with two time 
dimensions, things become less clear. Given two points along a single time 
dimension, there’s only one path between them. With two time dimensions, 

288
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
two points can potentially be connected by a number of different paths, some 
of which could loop back on themselves, creating a route into the past.
Most physicists have never looked into this possibility, for the simple 
fact that (in addition to making no logical sense) it wreaks havoc with the 
mathematical equations. Time dimensions have a negative sign, and if you 
incorporate even more of them you can end up with negative probabilities of 
something happening, which is physically meaningless.
However, Itzhak Bars of the University of Southern California in Los 
Angeles discovered in 1995 that M-theory allowed for the addition of an 
extra dimension — as long as that extra dimension was timelike.
To get this to make any sense, he had to apply another type of gauge symme­
try, which placed a constraint on the way objects could move. As he explored 
the equations, he realized that this gauge symmetry only worked if there 
were two extra dimensions — one extra time dimension and one extra space 
dimension. Two-time relativity has four space dimensions and two time 
dimensions, for a total of six dimensions. Two-time M-theory, on the other 
hand, ends up with 13 total dimensions — 11 space dimensions and two time 
dimensions.
The gauge symmetry that Bars introduced provided exactly the constraint he 
needed to eliminate time travel and negative probabilities from his theory. 
With his gauge symmetry in place, the world with six (or 13) dimensions 
should behave exactly like the world with four (or 11) dimensions.
Reflecting two-time onto 
a one-time universe
In a 2006 paper, Bars showed that the Standard Model is a shadow of his 
6-dimensional theory. Just like a 2-dimensional shadow of a 3-dimensional 
object can vary depending on where the light source is placed, the 4-dimen­
sional physical properties (“shadows”) can be caused by the behavior of the 
6-dimensional objects. The objects in the extra dimensions of Bars’s two-time 
physics theory can have multiple shadows in the 4-dimensional universe (like 
ours), each of which corresponds to different phenomena. Different physical 
phenomena in our universe can result from the same fundamental 6-dimen­
sional objects, manifesting in different ways.
	
To see how this works, consider a particle moving through empty space in six 
dimensions, with absolutely no forces affecting it. According to Bars’s calcu­
lations, such activity in six dimensions relates to at least two shadows (two 
physical representations of this 6-dimensional reality) in the 4-dimensional 
world:

289
 Chapter 16: Have Time, Will Travel
	
✓	An electron orbiting an atom
	
✓	A particle in an expanding universe
Bars believes that two-time physics can explain a puzzle in the Standard 
Model. Some parameters describing quantum chromodynamics (QCD) have 
been measured to be quite small, meaning that certain types of interactions 
are favored over others, but nobody knows why this is. Physicists have come 
up with a possible fix for this, but it involves predicting a new theoretical par­
ticle called an axion, which has never been observed.
According to Bars’s predictions, two-time physics presents a 4-dimensional 
world in which QCD interactions are not at all lopsided, so the axion isn’t 
needed. Unfortunately, the lack of discovery of an axion isn’t really enough to 
be counted as experimental proof of two-time physics.
For that, Bars has applied two-time physics to supersymmetry. In this case, 
the superpartners predicted have slightly different properties than the super­
partners predicted by other theories. If superpartners are observed at the 
Large Hadron Collider with the properties Bars suggests, this would be con­
sidered intriguing experimental evidence in favor of his claims.
Does two-time physics have 
any real applications?
Most physicists believe that these extra-dimensional results from Bars are 
just mathematical artifacts. Several theorists, including Stephen Hawking, 
have used the idea of imaginary time dimensions (an imaginary quantity 
in mathematics is the square root of a negative number), but rarely is this 
believed to have a real physical existence. To most physicists, they’re math­
ematical tools that simplify the equations.
However, history has shown that “mathematical artifacts” can frequently 
have a real existence. Bars himself seems to believe that they have as much 
physical reality as the four dimensions that we know exist, although we’ll 
never experience these extra dimensions as directly.
Though two-time physics doesn’t directly imply any time travel, if it’s true, it 
means that time is inherently more complex than physicists have previously 
believed. Unraveling the mystery of two-time physics could well introduce 
new ways that time travel might manifest in our universe.

Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
Sending Messages through Time
The original string theory, bosonic string theory, contained a massless 
particle called the tachyon, which travels faster than the speed of light. In 
Chapter 10, I explain how these particles are usually a sign that a theory has 
an inherent flaw — but what if they actually existed? Would they allow a 
means of time travel?
The short answer is that no one knows. The presence of tachyons in a theory 
means that things begin to go haywire, which is why they’re considered 
by physicists to be a sign of fundamental instabilities in the theory. (These 
instabilities in string theory were fixed by including supersymmetry, creating 
superstring theory — see Chapter 10.)
However, just because tachyons mess up the mathematics that physicists 
use doesn’t necessarily mean that they don’t exist. It may be possible that 
physicists just haven’t developed the proper mathematical tools to address 
them in a way that makes sense.
If tachyons do exist, then in theory it would be possible to send messages 
that travel faster than the speed of light. These particles could actually travel 
backward in time and, in principle, be detected.
To avoid this problem (because, remember, time travel can destroy all of 
physics!), the physicist Gerald Feinberg presented the Feinberg reinterpreta­
tion principle in 1967, which says that a tachyon traveling back in time can 
be reinterpreted, under quantum field theory, as a tachyon moving forward 
in time. In other words, detecting tachyons is the same as emitting tachyons. 
There’s just no way to tell the difference, which would make sending and 
receiving messages fairly challenging.
Time Travel Paradoxes
Time travel inherently creates a number of logical inconsistencies, called 
paradoxes. These problems have created some of the finest science fiction 
tales and films (see the nearby sidebar), and have troubled philosophers and 
scientists since they were first posed. Whether these inconsistencies mean 
that time travel is physically impossible remains to be seen, although they’re 
among the reasons why most physicists tend to believe that time travel is 
impossible.

291
 Chapter 16: Have Time, Will Travel
The twin paradox
The twin paradox is one of the classic examples of Einstein’s theory of relativ­
ity in action and dates back nearly as far as the theory itself. It is a thought 
experiment that exhibits the strange results of time dilation. (Technically, the 
twin paradox isn’t a paradox so much as a problem of inconsistent measure­
ments, but the name has stuck.)
Imagine our pair of twins, Maggie and Emily, once again. At age 20, Emily 
chooses to become an astronaut, getting recruited onto the first interstellar 
mission. Her ship is heading to a star that is 10 light-years away, but the ship 
will be traveling at nearly the speed of light, so time dilation will be in effect.
The ship is truly a wonder, and thanks to time dilation, the entire trip takes 
only a couple of months from Emily’s standpoint. She explores the distant 
region for eight months, collecting much fascinating data. She then returns, 
which also takes a couple of months. The entire trip takes Emily one year.
Maggie, on the other hand, stays on Earth. Because Emily was traveling to a 
star 10 light-years away at nearly the speed of light, Emily arrives at the star 
when Maggie is about 30 years old. She starts her return trip eight months 
later, and that leg of the trip also takes 10 years.
The twins have a tearful reunion, where the twin paradox suddenly becomes 
clear to each of them as the 41-year-old Maggie embraces her twin sister 
Emily, who appears to be 21 years old. Here is the “paradox:”
What is Emily’s actual age?
After all, Emily was born 41 years ago, the same time Maggie was. There is a 
logical sense in which Emily is 41 years old. On the other hand, by her “bio­
logical clock” only 21 years have passed, and she certainly doesn’t look 41.
There isn’t a single solution to the twin paradox, because the flow of time 
depends on how you choose to measure it. Time is, if you’ll excuse the 
phrase, relative.
No doubt if space travel ever becomes feasible, conventions of measuring 
time will need to be made. For example, if the legal drinking age is 21, can an 
18-year-old who has spent four years traveling at near lightspeed buy alcohol 
legally?

292
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
The grandfather paradox
Another paradox is called the grandfather paradox and comes up in cases 
where you can time travel into the past. If you travel into the past, it should 
be possible to alter the past. The grandfather paradox asks:
What happens if you change the past in a way that results in you being 
unable to go into the past in the first place?
Consider the classic example (which gives the paradox its name):
	
1.	 You travel into the past and accidentally cause the death of your own 
grandfather.
	
2.	 You cease to exist, and therefore do not travel into the past.
	
3.	 You do not cause the death of your grandfather.
	
4.	 You now exist, so continue back to step 1.
There are two logical resolutions to the paradox. (See the sidebar “The sci­
ence fiction of time” for examples of both of these resolutions, in the form of 
Back to the Future and Somewhere in Time.)
The first is based off of the many world interpretation (MWI) of quantum 
physics. In this view, many possible timelines exist and we exist in one of 
them. If you travel back in time and alter time, then you will continue forward 
in a different timeline than the one you initially began in.
The second possible resolution to the grandfather paradox is that it’s actu­
ally impossible to alter the past. The past is set in stone, and if you travel to 
the past, you’ll find that you’re unable to change the events that took place, 
no matter how hard you try.
Unfortunately, the second possibility creates some philosophical problems 
with free will, because if you are already part of the past, then that means 
that your own future is set — you will definitely travel into the past at some 
point. The past and the future both become set in stone.
Of course, no one knows which resolution is correct, and if Stephen 
Hawking’s chronology protection conjecture is true, it’s very likely that the 
situation never will arise. Still, it’s fun to speculate on.
Where are the time travelers?
One of the most practical paradoxes brought up regarding time travel is the cur­
rent lack of any time travelers. If time travel into the past were possible, then it 
would seem like people from the future would be showing up in our present.

293
 Chapter 16: Have Time, Will Travel
The science fiction of time
Talking about time travel without mentioning 
science fiction would leave an elephant in the 
chapter, so to speak. Here are some key sci­
ence fiction novels and films related to the 
time travel concepts discussed in this chap­
ter, although the list is by no means complete. 
Spoiler alert: Some plot details are revealed in 
the descriptions below.
Novels:
	✓	The Time Machine, by H. G. Wells (1895): 
The first story with a man-made device to 
travel in time, where the travel was under 
the control of the traveler (as opposed to 
stories that preceded it like Rip van Winkle, 
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s 
Court, or A Christmas Carol, where the time 
traveler had no control).
	✓	Tau Zero, by Poul Anderson (1967): A 
spaceship is trapped accelerating closer 
and closer to the speed of light, unable to 
decelerate. The novel explores the effects 
of time dilation and the possible end of the 
universe.
	✓	Gateway, by Frederick Pohl (1977): The sole 
survivor of a space accident has to come 
to terms with intense survivor’s guilt for the 
crew he left behind. The plot’s powerful 
climax (which I may now be ruining by tell­
ing you) relates to the idea that as you fall 
into a black hole, time slows down.
Films:
	✓	Somewhere in Time (1980): Richard Collier 
(Christopher Reeve) is a playwright who 
travels to 1912 from 1980. The film takes 
the stance that the past has already hap­
pened and Collier was already part of the 
events of the past (or he’s hallucinating, in 
which case this film has nothing to do with 
time travel and is far less interesting). For 
example, “before” he ever time travels, he 
finds his own signature in a hotel guestbook 
from 1912. Based on a novel by Richard 
Matheson.
	✓	Back to the Future (1985): Marty McFly 
(Michael J. Fox) travels from 1985 to 1955 
and interferes with his parents’ first meet­
ing. The film explores the concept of time 
paradoxes and potential multiple timelines. 
There were two sequels, but the original 
film was by far the best.
	✓	Frequency (2000): New York detective John 
Sullivan (James Caviezel) begins commu­
nicating with his father (Dennis Quaid) 30 
years in the past over a ham radio, which 
is bouncing signals off of strange sunspot 
activity. In this film, no material objects 
travel in time — only information in the form 
of radio waves. String theorist and author 
Brian Greene served as physics consultant 
and had a cameo in the film.
Not only do science fiction authors learn from 
scientists in developing their time travel sys­
tems, but inspiration can flow the other way. 
Dr. Ronald Mallet, who is trying to build a 
time machine, was motivated throughout his 
life by science fiction accounts of time travel. 
Kip Thorne has developed his theories of time 
travel out of helping friends work out the details 
of their science fiction novels. His first work on 
time travel was based on work performed to 
help Carl Sagan develop a realistic wormhole 
for his novel Contact in the 1980s, and he later 
gained insights from the science fiction author 
Robert Forward.

294
Part IV: The Unseen Cosmos: String Theory On the Boundaries of Knowledge 
The solution to this question in the Star Trek universe is the “temporal prime 
directive,” which basically makes the argument that time travelers are for­
bidden from interfering in the past. In this way, any time travelers among us 
would have to stay hidden.
A more scientific solution is the idea that time travel is only allowed after a 
time travel device has been constructed. When the device is active, you could 
use it to travel in time, but you obviously could never go to a time period 
before the device was created. In fact, every time machine that scientists have 
found that could exist in our universe has this very feature — you can never go 
back to before the invention (and activation) of the time machine.

Criticisms and 
Alternatives

In this part . . .
N
ot everyone embraces string theory as the theory 
that will answer the fundamental questions of 
physics. In fact, in recent years, even some string 
theorists have begun backing off of that claim.
In this part, I explain some of the major criticisms of 
string theory in recent years. I then explore the major 
alternative quantum gravity theory, loop quantum gravity, 
and other directions of research that may provide 
insights, regardless of whether string theory ultimately 
fails or succeeds. If string theory does fail, or even if it 
succeeds but not as a “theory of everything,” these 
alternative approaches may prove useful in filling the 
gaps. Some of these research efforts may provide clues 
that could help with the progress of string theory.

Theory Controversy

A
lthough many physicists believe that string theory holds the promise 
as the most likely theory of quantum gravity, there’s a growing skepticism 
among some that string theory hasn’t achieved the goals it set out for. The 
major thrust of the criticism is that, whatever useful benefits there are to 
studying string theory, it’s not actually a fundamental theory of reality, but 
only a useful approximation.
String theorists acknowledge some of these criticisms as valid and dismiss 
others as premature or even completely contrived. Whether or not the 
critics are right, they’ve been a part of string theory since the very first days 
and are likely to be around as long as the theory persists. Lately, the criticism 
has risen to such furor that it’s being called “the string wars” across many 
science blogs and magazines.
In this chapter, I discuss some of the major criticisms of string theory. I begin 
with a brief recap of the history of string theory, from the eye of the skeptic, 
who focuses on the failures instead of the successes. After that, I look into 
whether string theory has any ability to actually provide any solid predictions 
about the universe. Next, you see how string theory critics object to the 
extreme amount of control that string theorists hold over academic institutions 
and research plans. I then consider whether string theory possibly describes 
our own reality. And, finally, I explain some of the major string theory 
responses to these criticisms.

298
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
The String Wars: Outlining 
the Arguments
As long as it’s been around, string theory has contended with criticisms. 
Some of string theory’s critics are among the most respected members of 
the physics community, including Nobel laureates such as Sheldon Glashow 
and the late Richard Feynman, both of whom were critical as far back as the 
first superstring revolution in the mid-1980s. Still, string theory has steadily 
grown in popularity for decades.
Recently, the rise in criticisms against string theory has spilled into the 
popular media, making the front pages of science magazines and even large 
articles in more mainstream publications. The debate rages across radio 
waves, the Internet, academic conferences, the blogosphere, and anywhere 
else that debates are allowed to rage.
Though the debate sounds passionate, none of the critics are really 
advocating that physicists completely abandon string theory. Instead, they 
tend to view string theory as an effective theory (a useful approximation) 
rather than a truly fundamental theory, which describes the most basic level 
of reality itself. They are critical of string theorists’ attempts to continue to 
promote the theory as a fundamental theory of reality.
	
Here are some of the most significant criticisms levied against string theory 
(or the string theorists who practice it):
	
✓	String theory is unable to make any useful prediction about how the 
physical world behaves, so it can’t be falsified or verified.
	
✓	String theory is so vaguely defined and lacking in basic physical 
principles that any idea can be incorporated into it.
	
✓	String theorists put too much weight on the opinions of leaders and 
authorities within their own ranks, as opposed to seeking experimental 
verification.
	
✓	String theorists present their work in ways that falsely demonstrate 
that they’ve achieved more success than they actually have. (This isn’t 
necessarily an accusation of lying, but may be a fundamental flaw in how 
success is measured by string theorists and the scientific community at 
large.)
	
✓	String theory gets more funding and academic support than other 
theoretical approaches (in large part because of the aforementioned 
reported progress).
	
✓	String theory doesn’t describe our universe, but contradicts known facts 
of physical reality in a number of ways, requiring elaborate hypothetical 
constructions that have never been successfully demonstrated.

299
 Chapter 17: Taking a Closer Look at the String Theory Controversy
Behind many of these criticisms is the assumption that string theory, which 
has been around for 30 years, should be a bit more fully developed than it 
actually is. None of the critics are arguing to abandon the study of string 
theory; they just want alternative theories to be pursued with greater 
intensity, because of the belief that string theory is falling short of the mark.
To explore the validity of these claims and determine whether string theory 
is in fact unraveling, it’s necessary to lay out the frame of the debate by 
looking at where string theory has been and where it is today.
Thirty years and counting: Framing the 
debate from the skeptic’s point of view
Even now, with criticism on the rise, it doesn’t appear that the study of string 
theory has dropped. To understand why physicists continue to study string 
theory, and why other physicists believe it isn’t delivering as promised, let 
me briefly recount the general trends in the history of string theory, focusing 
this time on its shortcomings. (This material is presented in significantly 
greater detail in Chapters 10 and 11.)
String theory started in 1968 as a theory (called the dual resonance model) to 
predict the interactions of hadrons (protons and neutrons), but failed at that. 
Instead of this model, quantum chromodynamics, which said that hadrons were 
composed of quarks held together by gluons, proved to be the correct model.
Analysis of the early version of string theory showed that it could be viewed 
as very tiny strings vibrating. In fact, this bosonic string theory had several 
flaws: fermions couldn’t exist and the theory contained 25 space dimensions, 
tachyons, and too many massless particles.
These problems were “fixed” with the addition of supersymmetry, which 
transformed bosonic string theory into superstring theory. Superstring 
theory still contained nine space dimensions, though, so most physicists still 
believed it had no physical reality.
This new version of string theory was shown to contain a massless, spin-2 
particle that could be the graviton. Now, instead of a theory of hadron 
interactions, string theory was a theory of quantum gravity. But most 
physicists were exploring other theories of quantum gravity, and string 
theory languished throughout the 1970s.
The first superstring revolution took place in the mid-1980s, when physicists 
showed ways to construct string theory that made all the anomalies go away. 
In other words, string theory was shown to be consistent. In addition, physicists 
found ways to compactify the extra six space dimensions by curling them up 
into complex shapes that were so tiny they would never be observed.

Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
The rise in work on string theory had great results. In fact, the results were 
too good, because physicists discovered five distinct variations of string 
theory, each of which predicted different phenomena in the universe and 
none of which precisely matched our own.
In 1995, Edward Witten proposed that the five versions of string theory were 
different low-energy approximations of a single theory, called M-theory. 
This new theory contained ten space dimensions and strange objects called 
branes, which had more dimensions than strings.
A major success of string theory was that it was used to construct a 
description for black holes, which calculated the entropy correctly, according 
to the Hawking-Bekenstein predictions for black hole thermodynamics. This 
description applied only to specific types of simplified black holes, although 
there was some indication that the work might extend to more general black 
holes.
A problem for string theory arose in 1998, when astrophysicists showed that 
the universe was expanding. In other words, the cosmological constant of 
the universe is positive, but all work in string theory had assumed a negative 
cosmological constant. (The positive cosmological constant is commonly 
referred to as dark energy.)
In 2003, a method was found to construct string theory in a universe that had 
dark energy, but there was a major problem with it: A vast number of distinct 
string theories were possible. Some estimates have been as much as 10500 
distinct ways to formulate the theory, which is so absurdly large that it can 
be treated as if it were basically infinity.
As a response to these findings, physicist Leonard Susskind proposed the 
application of the anthropic principle as a means of explaining why our 
universe had the properties it did, given the incredibly large number of 
possible configurations, which Susskind called the landscape.
This brings us to the current status of string theory, in very broad strokes. 
You can probably see some chinks in string theory’s armor, where the 
criticisms seem to resonate particularly strongly.
A rise of criticisms
After evidence of dark energy was discovered in 1998 and the 2003 work 
increased the number of known solutions, there seemed to be some growth 
in criticisms. The attempts to make the theory fit physical reality were 
growing a bit more strained, in the eyes of some, and a discontent that had 
always existed under the surface began to seep out of the back rooms at 
physics conferences and onto the front pages of major science magazines.

301
 Chapter 17: Taking a Closer Look at the String Theory Controversy
While innovative new variants — such as the Randall-Sundrum models and 
the incorporation of a positive cosmological constant — were rightly 
recognized as brilliant, some people believed that physicists had to come 
up with contrived explanations to keep the theory viable.
The growth in criticism became glaringly obvious to the general public in 
2006 with the publication of two books criticizing — or outright attacking — 
string theory. The books were Lee Smolin’s The Trouble with Physics: The 
Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next and Peter 
Woit’s Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in 
Physical Law. These books, along with the media fervor that accompanies 
any potential clash of ideas, has put string theory on the public relations 
defensive even while many (possibly most) string theorists dismiss the 
Smolin and Woit claims as failed attempts to discredit string theory for their 
own aggrandizement.
The truth is likely somewhere in between. The criticisms have a bit more 
merit than string theorists would give them, but are not quite as destructive 
as Woit, at least, would tend to have readers believe. (Smolin is a bit more 
sympathetic toward string theory, despite his book’s subtitle.) None of the 
critics propose abandoning string theory entirely; they merely would like to 
see more scientists pursuing other areas of inquiry, such as those described 
in Chapters 18 and 19.
Is String Theory Scientific?
The first two criticisms cut to the core of whether string theory is successful 
as a scientific theory. Not just any idea, not even one that’s expressed in 
mathematical terms, is scientific. In the past, to be scientific, a theory had to 
describe something that is happening in our own universe. To go too far from 
this boundary enters the realm of speculation. Criticisms of string theory as 
unscientific tend to fall in two (seemingly contradictory) categories:
	
✓	String theory explains nothing.
	
✓	String theory explains too much.
Argument No. 1: String theory 
explains nothing
The first attack on string theory is that, after about 30 years of investigation, 
it still makes no clear predictions. (Physicists would say it has no predictive 
power.) The theory makes no unique prediction that, if true, supports the 
theory and, if false, refutes the theory.

302
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
According to philosopher Sir Karl Popper, the trait of “falsifiability” is the 
defining trait of science. If a theory is not falsifiable — if there is no way to 
make a prediction that gets a false result — then the theory is not scientific.
	
If you subscribe to Popper’s view (and many scientists don’t), then string 
theory is certainly not scientific — at least not yet. The question is whether 
string theory is fundamentally unable to make a clear, falsifiable prediction or 
whether it merely hasn’t done so yet, but will at some point in the future.
It’s possible that string theorists will make a distinct prediction at some 
point. Part of the criticism, though, is that string theorists are really not 
concerned with making a prediction. Some string theorists don’t even seem 
to consider the lack of a currently testable prediction to be a shortcoming, so 
long as string theory remains consistent with the known evidence.
This is what motivates the major critics of string theory, from Feynman in 
the 1980s to Smolin and Woit today, to complain that string theory has no 
contact with experiment and is fundamentally warping what it means to 
investigate something scientifically.
Argument No. 2: String theory 
explains too much
The second attack is based on the same problem, that string theory makes 
no unique prediction, but the emphasis this time is on the word “unique.” 
There are so many variations of string theory that even if it could be 
formulated in a way that it would make a prediction, it seems as if each 
version of string theory would make a slightly different prediction.
This is, in a way, almost worse than making no prediction at all. With no 
prediction, you can make the argument that more work and refinement needs 
to be done, new mathematical tools developed, and so on. With a nearly 
infinite number of predictions, you’re stuck with a theory that’s completely 
useless. Again, it has no predictive power, for the simple reason that you can 
never sort out the sheer volume of results.
Part of this argument relates back to the principle of Occam’s razor. 
According to this principle, there is an economy in nature, which means that 
nature (as described by science) doesn’t include things that aren’t necessary. 
String theory includes extra dimensions, new types of particles, and possibly 
whole extra universes that have never been observed (and possibly can 
never be observed).

303
 Chapter 17: Taking a Closer Look at the String Theory Controversy
New rules to the game: The anthropic principle revisited
The solution for so many predictions, as proposed by physicist Leonard 
Susskind, is to apply the anthropic principle to focus on the regions of the 
string theory landscape that allow life to exist. According to Susskind, Earth 
clearly exists in a universe (or a region of the universe, at least) that allows 
life to exist, so selecting only theories that allow life to exist seems to be a 
reasonable strategy.
	
Taking a theory that doesn’t allow life to exist and considering it on equal 
footing with theories that do allow life to exist, when we know that life does 
exist, defies both scientific reasoning and common sense.
From this stance, the anthropic principle is a way of removing selection bias 
when looking at different possible string theories. Instead of looking only at 
the mathematical viability of a theory, as if that were the only criteria, 
physicists can also select based on the fact that we live here.
However, there’s a bit of clever maneuvering within this discussion that 
shouldn’t go unmentioned. It’s not just that Susskind has said that we can use 
the anthropic principle to select which theories are viable in our universe, 
but he’s gone further to indicate that the very fact that all of these versions 
of string theory exist is a good thing. It provides a richness to the theory, 
making it more robust. (Still others point out that all quantum field theories 
have lots of potential solutions, so string theory shouldn’t be any different. 
In those cases, both sides of this particular debate are looking at it the 
wrong way.)
For nearly two decades, many physicists were trying to find a single version 
of string theory that included basic physical principles that dictated the 
nature of the universe. The current Standard Model has 18 fundamental 
particles, which have to be measured in experiment and placed into the 
theory by hand. Part of the goal of string theory was to find a theory that, 
based on pure physical principles and mathematical elegance, would yield a 
single theory describing all of reality.
Instead, string theorists have found a virtually infinite number of different 
theories (or, to be more precise, different string theory solutions) and have 
apparently discovered that no fundamental law describes the universe based 
on basic physical principles. Selection of the correct parameters for the 
theory is, once again, left to experiment.
But instead of interpreting this as a failure and indicating that we have no 
choice but to apply the anthropic principle to provide limitations on which 
options are available to us, Susskind takes lemons and turns them into 
lemonade by reframing the entire context of success. Success is no longer 
finding a single theory, but exploring as much of the landscape as possible.

304
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
	
In their book Aristotle and an Aardvark go to Washington: Understanding 
Political Doublespeak Through Philosophy and Jokes, authors Thomas Cathcart 
and Daniel Klein refer to this sort of technique as the “Texas sharpshooter 
fallacy.” Imagine the Texas sharpshooter who pulls out his pistol and fires at 
the wall and then walks up and draws the bull’s-eye around the location where 
the shots landed.
In a (very critical) sense, this is what Susskind has done, by changing the 
actual definition of success in string theory. He has (according to some) 
redefined the goal of the enterprise and done so in such a way that the 
current work is exactly in line with the new goal. If this new approach is valid, 
yielding a way to correctly describe nature, it’s brilliant. If not valid, then it’s 
not brilliant. (For the more favorable interpretation of the anthropic principle, 
see Chapters 11 and 14.)
A similar moving target can be seen in the discussion of proton decay. 
Originally, experiments to prove grand unified theories (GUTs) anticipated 
that these experiments would detect the decay of a few protons every year. 
No proton decays have been found, however, which has caused theorists 
to revise their calculations to arrive at a lower decay rate. Except most 
physicists believe that these attempts are not valid and that these GUT 
approaches have been disproved. This after-the-fact change in what they’re 
looking for is not a valid approach to science — unless the decays are 
discovered at the new rate, of course (at which point the theoretical 
modification becomes a brilliant insight).
None of this is to imply that Susskind is being dishonest or manipulative in 
presenting the anthropic principle as an option that he believes in. He has 
very genuinely been led to this belief because of the growing number of 
mathematically viable string theory solutions, which leave him with no 
choice (except for abandoning string theory, which I get to in a bit).
After you accept that string theory dictates a large number of possible 
solutions, and you realize that modern theories of eternal inflation dictate 
that many of these solutions may well be realized in some reality, there’s 
very little choice, in Susskind’s view, other than to accept the anthropic 
principle. And there’s every indication that he went through some serious 
soul searching before deciding to preach the anthropic message.
Interpreting the string theory landscape
No longer is string theory looking for a single theory, but it’s now trying to 
pare down the vast options in the landscape to find the one, or the handful, 
that may be consistent with our universe. The anthropic principle can be 
used as one of the major selection criteria to distinguish theories that clearly 
don’t apply to our universe.

305
 Chapter 17: Taking a Closer Look at the String Theory Controversy
The question that remains is whether string theorists (or any physicist) 
should be happy about this situation.
Certainly, some are not. David Gross is not. Edward Witten seems at best 
lukewarm about the prospect. Susskind and Joe Polchinski, however, seem 
to have had a full conversion. They have not only resigned themselves to 
accepting the circumstances, but have embraced it, despite the fact that a 
few years ago both were opposed to any application of the anthropic 
principle in science.
The anthropic principle seems unavoidable if there exists a vast multiverse, 
where many different regions of the string theory landscape are realized in 
the form of parallel universes. Some universes will exist where life is allowed, 
and we’re one of them — get used to it.
Some string theorists who haven’t accepted the anthropic arguments are 
hopeful that the theory’s mathematical and physical features can rule out 
large portions of the landscape. String theorists are still divided over exactly 
what conclusions the theory allows and whether there might be some way to 
sort them out without applying the anthropic principle. More work must be 
done before anyone knows for sure.
Turning a Critical Eye to String Theorists
One of the major criticisms of string theory has to do not with the theory so 
much as with theorists. The argument is that they are forming something of a 
“cult” of string theorists, who have bonded together to promote string theory 
above all alternatives.
This criticism, which is at the heart of Smolin’s The Trouble with Physics, is 
not so much a criticism of string theory as a fundamental criticism of the way 
academic resources are allocated. One criticism of Smolin’s book has been 
that he is in part demanding more funding for the research projects that he 
and his friends are working on, which he feels are undersupported. (Many of 
these alternative fields are covered in Chapters 18 and 19.)
Hundreds of physicists just can’t be wrong
String theory is the most popular approach to a theory of quantum gravity, 
but that very phrase — most popular — is exactly the problem in the eyes of 
some. In physics, who cares (or who should care) how popular a theory is?

306
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
In fact, some critics believe that string theory is little more than a cult of 
personality. The practitioners of this arcane art have long ago foregone the 
regular practice of science, and now bask in the glory of seer-like authority 
figures like Edward Witten, Leonard Susskind, and Joe Polchinski, whose 
words can no more be wrong than the sun can stop shining.
This is, of course, an exaggeration of the criticism, but in some cases, not by 
much. String theorists have spent more than two decades building a community 
of physicists who firmly believe that they are performing the most important 
science on the planet, even while achieving not a single bit of evidence to 
definitively support their version of science as the right one, and the folks at 
the top of that community carry a lot of weight. (For a look at this behavior in 
nonphysics contexts, see the nearby sidebar “Appeal to authority.”)
John Moffat has joined Smolin and Woit in lamenting the “lost generation” of 
brilliant physicists who have spent their time on string theory, to no avail. 
He points out that the sheer volume of physicists publishing papers on string 
theory, and in turn citing other string theorists, skews the indexes about 
which papers and scientists are truly the most important.
For example, there is a rumor that Edward Witten has the highest h-index of 
any living scientist. (The h-index is a measure of how often papers are cited.) 
If you look at it from Moffat’s point of view, this is not necessarily a result 
of Witten being the most important physicist of his generation, but rather a 
result of Witten writing papers that are fundamental to string theory, and, in 
turn, are cited by the vast majority of people writing papers on string theory, 
which is a lot of papers.
Now the problem with this approach when it comes to Witten specifically is 
that it’s very possible that he is the most important physicist of his generation. 
Certainly his Fields Medal attests to his position as one of the most 
mathematically gifted. But if he is an important physicist who has helped 
lead a generation of physicists down a road that ends in string theory as a 
failed theory of quantum gravity, then that would indeed make for a “lost 
generation” and a tragic waste of Witten’s brilliance.
Holding the keys to the academic kingdom
The theoretical physics and particle physics communities in many of the 
major physics departments, especially in the United States, lean heav­
ily toward string theory as the preferred approach to a quantum gravity 
theory. In fact, the growing need for diverse approaches (such as those from 
Chapters 18 and 19) is maintained even by some string theorists, who realize 
the importance of including conflicting viewpoints.

307
 Chapter 17: Taking a Closer Look at the String Theory Controversy
In a debate between Brian Greene and Lee Smolin on National Public Radio, 
Greene acknowledged the need to work on areas other than string theory, 
pointing out that some of his own graduate students are working on other 
approaches to solving problems of quantum gravity.
Lisa Randall — whose own work has often been influenced by string theory — 
describes how, during the first superstring revolution, Harvard physicists 
remained more closely tied to the particle physics tradition, and to 
experimental results, while Princeton researchers devoted themselves 
largely to the purely theoretical enterprise of string theory. In the end, every 
particle theorist at Princeton worked on string theory, which she identifies as 
a mistake — and one that continues to this day.
These stances indicate that if a “string theory cult” does exist, then Brian 
Greene and Lisa Randall have apparently not been inducted into it. Still, the 
fact is that theoretical physics departments at several major universities 
are now dominated by string theory supporters, and some feel that other 
approaches are inherently marginalized by that.
Appeal to authority
Although it may seem odd to many people that 
scientists could be swayed by figures of authority, 
this is a fundamental part of human nature. The 
“appeal to authority” was cited by Aristotle, 
the father of rhetoric (the science of debate). 
It has been given the Latin name argumentum 
ad verecundiam, and evidence from psychology 
has born out that it works. People are inclined 
to believe an authority figure, sometimes even 
over common sense.
Marketers know that one of the most persuasive 
ways to sell something is to get a testimonial. 
This is why speakers are introduced by someone 
else, for example. If another person gets up and 
lists the speaker’s accomplishments, it means 
a lot more to the listeners than if the speaker 
stands up, introduces herself, and lists off her 
own accomplishments. This is the case even 
when the introducer knows nothing about the 
person except what he reads off of a card or 
teleprompter.
When the person who is providing the testimonial 
is perceived as an authority figure, it’s even 
more potent. This is why some books have 
quotes from authorities on them and why 
politicians seek celebrity endorsements. I’m 
sure some people voted for Barack Obama 
in 2008 because Oprah Winfrey, an authority 
figure if ever there was one, endorsed him 
publicly.
In the case of string theory, of course, the 
authority figures aren’t just popular, they 
are experts in physics, and string theory in 
particular, so listening to their opinion on string 
theory is a bit more reasonable than listening 
to a single popular actor, musician, athlete, or 
clergyman on whom to vote into the presidency. 
Ultimately, in science (as in the rest of life) 
people should use their own logic to evaluate 
the arguments put forward by the experts. 
Fortunately, scientists are trained to use their 
logic more intently than most of society.

308
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
This criticism is one of the fairest, I think, because science, like any other 
field of endeavor, needs criticism. Psychologists have shown that the 
phenomenon of “groupthink” takes hold in situations where the only people 
who are allowed a seat at the table are those who think alike. If you want to 
have a robust intellectual exchange — something that’s at the heart of 
physics and other sciences — it’s important that you include people who 
will challenge your viewpoints and not just agree with them.
Some criticisms of Smolin’s book have indicated that he wants some sort of 
handout for himself and his buddies who aren’t able to cut it in the normal grant 
application process. (In the other direction, Smolin and Woit have implied that 
similar economic interests are at the heart of the support for string theory.)
But if the institutes that determine how funding is allocated are dominated 
by people who believe that string theory is the only viable theory, then 
these alternate approaches won’t get funded. Add to that the citation issues 
described earlier in this chapter, which possibly make string theory look 
more successful than it actually is, and there’s room for valid criticism of 
how funding is allocated in physics.
Still, hope for these alternatives isn’t lost. As popular as string theory is, I 
believe it’s likely that most theoretical physicists want to find answers more 
than they want to be proved right. Physicists will gravitate (so to speak) 
toward the theories that provide them the best opportunity to discover a 
fundamental truth about the universe.
So long as these non-string theorists continue doing solid work in these 
other areas, then they have the hope of drawing recruits from the younger 
generation. Eventually, if string theorists don’t find some way to make string 
theory succeed, it will lose its dominant position.
Does String Theory Describe 
Our Universe?
Now comes the real science question related to string theory: Does it 
describe our universe? The short answer is that no, it does not. It can be 
written in such a way to describe some idealized worlds that bear similarities 
to our world, but it can’t yet describe our world.
Unfortunately, you have to know a lot about string theory to realize that. 
String theorists are rarely upfront about how far their theory is from 
describing our reality (when talking to public audiences, at least). It tends 
to be a disclaimer, woven into the details of their presentations or thrown 
in just near the end. In fact, you could read many of the books out there on 
string theory and, after turning the last page, you wouldn’t have ever been 
told explicitly that it doesn’t describe our universe.

309
 Chapter 17: Taking a Closer Look at the String Theory Controversy
Congratulations on not choosing one of those books.
Making sense of extra dimensions
The world described by string theory has at least 6 more space dimensions 
than the 3 we know, for a total of 9 space dimensions. In M-theory, there 
are at least 10 space dimensions, and in the two-time M-theory, there are 11 
space dimensions (with 2 time dimensions tacked on).
The problem is that physicists don’t know where these extra dimensions are. 
In fact, the main reason for believing that they exist is that the equations of 
string theory demand them. These extra dimensions have been compactified 
(in some models) in ways that their particular geometry generates certain 
features of our universe.
There are two major ways of dealing with the extra dimensions:
	
✓	The extra dimensions are compactified, probably at about the Planck 
scale (although some models allow for them to be larger).
	
✓	Our universe is “stuck” on a three space dimensional brane (brane 
world scenarios).
There is another alternative: The extra dimensions may not exist. (This 
would be the approach suggested by applying Occam’s razor.) Various 
physicists have developed approaches to string theory without extra 
dimensions, as discussed in Chapter 13, so abandoning the idea of 
extra dimensions doesn’t even require an abandonment of string theory!
Space-time should be fluid
One of the hallmarks of modern physics is general relativity. The clash 
between general relativity and quantum physics is part of the motivation 
for looking for a string theory, but some critics believe that string theory is 
designed in such a way that it doesn’t faithfully maintain the principles of 
general relativity.
Which principles of general relativity aren’t maintained in string theory? 
Specifically, the idea that space-time is a dynamic entity that responds to 
the presence of matter around it. In other words, space-time is flexible. In 
physics terminology, general relativity is a background-independent theory, 
because the background (space-time) is incorporated into the theory. A 
background-dependent theory is one where objects in the theory are sort of 
“plugged in” to a space-time framework.

310
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
	
Right now, string theory is a background-dependent framework. Space-time is 
rigid, instead of flexible. If you are given a certain configuration of space-time, 
you can discuss how a given version of string theory would behave in that 
system.
The question is whether string theory, which right now can only be formulated 
in fixed space-time environments, can really accommodate a fundamentally 
dynamic space-time framework. How can you turn the rigid space-time of 
string theory into the flexible space-time of general relativity? The pessimist 
replies “You can’t” and works on loop quantum gravity (see Chapter 18).
The optimist, however, believes that string theory still has hope. Even with 
a rigid background of space-time, it’s possible to get general relativity as a 
limiting case of string theory. This isn’t quite as good as getting a flexible 
space-time, but it means that string theory certainly doesn’t exclude general 
relativity. Instead of getting the full high-definition version of space-time, 
though, you’re left with something more like a flipbook, which treats each 
image as static but, overall, provides the impression of smooth motion.
String theory is a work-in-progress, and it’s still hoped that physical and 
mathematical principles might be developed that will allow for the 
expression of a fully dynamic background in string theory. String theorists 
are forced to talk about the theory in a rigid space-time (background 
dependent) only because they haven’t yet found a mathematical language 
that will let them talk about it in a flexible space-time (background-independent). 
Some believe that Maldacena’s AdS/CFT correspondence may provide a 
means of incorporating this background-independent language. It’s also 
possible that the principles that allow this new language will come from an 
unexpected direction, such as the work described in Chapters 18 and 19.
Or, of course, such principles may not exist at all, and the skeptic’s 
inclination to criticize string theory may therefore be justified.
How finite is string theory?
One criticism that has arisen largely since Smolin’s The Trouble with Physics 
is the notion that string theory isn’t necessarily a finite theory. Remember 
that this is one of the key features in support of string theory: It removes the 
infinities that arise when you try to apply quantum physics directly to 
problems.
As Smolin describes things, this belief in string theory finiteness is largely 
based on a 1992 proof performed by Stanley Mandelstam, in which 
Mandelstam only proved that the first term of string theory (remember that 
string theory is an equation made up of an infinite series of mathematical 
terms) was finite. It has since been proved for the second term, as well.

311
 Chapter 17: Taking a Closer Look at the String Theory Controversy
Still, even if every individual term is finite, string theory currently is written 
in a form (like quantum field theory) that has an infinite number of terms. 
Even if each term is finite, it’s possible that the sum of all of the terms will 
yield an infinite result. Because infinities are never witnessed in our universe, 
this would mean that string theory doesn’t describe our universe.
	
The fact that string theory finiteness hasn’t been proved isn’t a flaw in string 
theory. The fact that most string theorists thought that it had been proved 
finite when it wasn’t is the flaw — not necessarily a flaw in string theory itself, 
but a flaw in the very way these scientists are practicing their science. The 
bigger issue at stake in this particular criticism is one of precision and 
intellectual honesty.
A String Theory Rebuttal
In the light of all of these criticisms, many of which have some measure of 
validity or logic to them, you may be wondering how anyone could continue 
working on string theory. How could some of the most brilliant physicists in 
the world devote their careers to exploring a field that is apparently a house 
of cards?
The short answer, stated in various forms by many string theorists over the 
years, is that they find it hard to believe that such a beautiful theory would 
not apply to the universe. String theory describes all of the behavior of the 
universe from certain fundamental principles as the vibrations of 1-dimensional 
strings and compactification of extra dimensional geometries, and can be 
used in some simplified versions to solve problems that have meaning to 
physicists, such as black hole entropy.
Most string theorists are able to dismiss the idea that string theory should 
be further along than it is. String theory does, after all, explore energies and 
sizes beyond our current technology to test. And, even in cases where 
experiment can guide theory, there are cases where 30 years was not enough 
time.
	
The theory of light took much longer than 30 years to develop. In the late 
1600s, Newton described light as tiny particles. In the 1800s, experiments 
revealed that it traveled as waves. In 1905, Einstein proposed the quantum 
principles that led to wave-particle duality, which in turn resulted in the 
theory of quantum electrodynamics in the 1940s. In other words, the rigorous 
physical examination of light traces a path from Newton through to Feynman 
that covers about 250 years, filled with many false leads along the way.
And quantum electrodynamics is a quantum field theory, which means it has 
infinite solutions unless it goes through a process of renormalization. The 
fact that string theory may also be infinite isn’t seen as a big deal, because 

312
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
the existing theory is definitely infinite. (Although, again, one of the 
motivations of string theory was to remove the infinities.)
For that matter, it took more than 1,500 years for heliocentric models of the 
Earth’s motion to be accepted over geocentric models, even though anyone 
could look up at the sky! It’s only because our modern world moves so fast 
that we feel we need quick and easy answers to something as simple as the 
fundamental nature of the universe.
As mentioned earlier, neither side has won the debate (or “string wars”) 
yet, but many feel that the very fact that the debate is taking place is, on the 
whole, good for science. And those who don’t — well, they’re probably part 
of a groupthink cult of string theorists.

hough string theory is often promoted as the “only consistent theory of 
quantum gravity” (or something along those lines), some would disagree 
with this categorization. Foremost among them are the researchers in a field 
known as loop quantum gravity (sometimes abbreviated LQG). I discuss other 
approaches to quantum gravity in Chapter 19.
In this chapter, I introduce you to loop quantum gravity, an alternative theory 
of quantum gravity. As string theory’s major competitor, loop quantum gravity 
hopes to answer many of the same questions by using a different approach. 
I start by describing the basic principles of loop quantum gravity and then 
present some of the major benefits of this approach over string theory. I lay 
out some of the preliminary predictions of loop quantum gravity, including 
possible ways to test it. Finally, I consider whether loop quantum gravity has 
the same fundamental flaws that may bring down string theory.
Taking the Loop: Introducing Another 
Road to Quantum Gravity
Loop quantum gravity is string theory’s biggest competitor. It gets less press 
than string theory, in part because it has a fundamentally more limited goal: a 
quantum theory of gravity. Loop quantum gravity performs this feat by trying 
to quantize space itself — in other words, treat space like it comes in small 
chunks.

Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
In contrast, string theory starts with methods of particle physics and 
frequently hopes to not only provide a method of creating a quantum theory 
of gravity, but also explain all of particle physics, unifying gravity with the 
other forces at the same time. Oh, and it predicts extra dimensions, which is 
very cool!
It’s no wonder that loop quantum gravity has more trouble getting press.
The great background debate
The key insight of quantum physics is that some quantities in nature come 
in multiples of discrete values, called quanta. This principle has successfully 
been applied to all of physics, except for gravity. This is the motivation for 
the search for quantum gravity.
Alternately, the key insight from general relativity is that space-time is a 
dynamic entity, not a fixed framework. String theory is a background-
dependent theory (built on a fixed framework; see Chapter 17 for more on 
this), so it doesn’t currently account for the dynamic nature of space-time at 
the heart of relativity.
According to the LQG researchers, a theory of quantum gravity must be 
background-independent, a theory that explains space and time instead of 
being plugged into an already-existing space-time stage. No background-
dependent theory can ever yield general relativity as a low-energy 
approximation.
	
Loop quantum gravity tries to achieve this goal by looking at the smooth 
fabric of space-time in general relativity and contemplating the question 
of whether, like regular fabric, it might be made up of smaller fibers woven 
together. The connections between these quanta of space-time may yield a 
background-independent way of looking at gravity in the quantum world.
What is looping anyway?
Loop quantum gravity’s key insight is that you can describe space as a field; 
instead of a bunch of points, space is a bunch of lines. The loop in loop 
quantum gravity has to do with the fact that as you view these field lines 
(which don’t have to be straight lines, of course), they can loop around and 
through each other, creating a spin network. By analyzing this network of 
space bundles, you can supposedly extract results that are equivalent to the 
known laws of physics.

315
 Chapter 18: Loop Quantum Gravity: String Theory’s Biggest Competitor
The foundation of LQG took place in 1986, when Abhay Ashtekar rewrote 
general relativity as a series of field lines instead of a grid of points. The 
result turns out not only to be simpler than the earlier approach, but is 
similar to a gauge theory.
There’s one problem, though: Gauge theories are background-dependent 
theories (they are inserted into a fixed space-time framework), but that won’t 
work, because the field lines themselves represent the geometry of space. 
You can’t plug the theory into space if space is already part of the theory!
In order to proceed, physicists working in this area had to look at quantum 
field theory in a whole new way so it could be approached in a background-
independent setting. Much of this work was performed by Ashtekar, Lee 
Smolin, Ted Jacobson, and Carlo Rovelli, who can reasonably be considered 
among the fathers of loop quantum gravity.
As LQG developed, it became clear that the theory represented a network of 
connected quantum space bundles, often called “atoms” of space. The failure 
of previous attempts to write a quantum theory of gravity was that space-
time was treated as continuous, instead of being quantized itself. The 
evolution of these connections is what provides the dynamic framework of 
space (although it has yet to be proved that loop quantum gravity actually 
reduces to the same predictions as those given by relativity).
Each atom of space can be depicted with a point (called a node) on a certain 
type of grid. The grid of all of these nodes, and the connections between 
them, is called a spin network. (Spin networks were originally developed by 
Oxford physicist Roger Penrose back in the 1970s.) The graph around each 
node can change locally over time, as shown in Figure 18-1 (which shows the 
initial state [a] and the new state it changes into [b]). The idea is that the 
sum total of these changes will end up matching the smooth space-time 
predictions of relativity on larger scales. (That last bit is the major part that 
has yet to be proved.)

Now, when you look at these lines and picture them in three dimensions, the 
lines exist inside of space — but that’s the wrong way to think about it. In 
LQG, the spin network with all of these nodes and grid lines, the entire spin 
network, is actually space itself. The specific configuration of the spin network 
is the geometry of space.
The analysis of this network of quantum units of space may result in more 
than physicists bargained for, because recent studies have indicated that 
the Standard Model particles may be implicit in the theory. This work has 
largely been pioneered by Fotini Markopoulou and work by the Australian 
Sundance O. Bilson-Thompson. In Bilson-Thompson’s model, the loops may 
braid together in ways that could create the particles, as indicated in Figure 
18-2. (These results remain entirely theoretical, and it remains to be seen 
how they work into the larger LQG framework as it develops, or whether they 
have any physical meaning at all.)

 Chapter 18: Loop Quantum Gravity: String Theory’s Biggest Competitor
Making Predictions with 
Loop Quantum Gravity
Loop quantum gravity makes some definite predictions, which may mean 
that it could be tested well before string theory can be. As string theory’s 
popularity is being brought into question, the amount of research into LQG 
may end up growing.
Gravity exists (Duh!)
Oddly enough, because LQG was born out of general relativity, one question 
has been whether science can get general relativity back out of the theory. 
In other words, can scientists use loop quantum gravity to actually match 
Einstein’s classical theory of gravity on large scales? The answer is: yes, in 
some special cases (as does string theory).
For example, work by Carlo Rovelli and his colleagues has shown that LQG 
contains gravitons, at least in the low-energy version of the theory, and also 
that two masses placed into the theory will attract each other in accord 
with Newton’s law of gravity. Further theoretical work is needed to get solid 
correlations between LQG and general relativity.
Black holes contain only so much space
Loop quantum gravity’s major success has been in matching the Bekenstein 
prediction of black hole entropy as well as the Hawking radiation predictions 
(both described in Chapter 9). As mentioned in Chapters 11 and 14, string 
theory has been able to make some predictions about special types of black 
holes, which is also consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking theories. So, 
at the very least, if scientists are able to create miniature black holes in the 
Large Hadron Collider and observe Hawking radiation, then it would certainly 
not rule out either of the theories.
However, the picture given by LQG is very different from that of classical 
black holes. Instead of an infinite singularity, the quantum rules say there’s 
only so much space inside of the black hole. Some LQG theorists hope they 
can predict tiny adjustments to Hawking’s theory that, if experimentally 
proven true, would support LQG above string theory.

318
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
One prediction is that instead of a singularity, the matter falling into a black 
hole begins expanding into another region of space-time, consistent with 
some earlier predictions by Bryce DeWitt and John Archibald Wheeler. In 
fact, singularities at the big bang are also eliminated, providing another 
possible eternal universe model. (For more eternal universe models, see 
Chapter 14.)
Gamma ray burst radiation 
travels at different speeds
Many of the experiments from Chapter 12, which could test whether the 
speed of light varies, would also be consistent with loop quantum gravity. For 
example, it’s possible that gamma ray burst radiation doesn’t all travel at the 
same speed, like classical relativity predicts. As the radiation passes through 
the spin network of quantized space, the high-energy gamma rays would 
travel slightly slower than the low-energy gamma rays. Again, these effects 
would be magnified over the vast distances traveled to possibly be observed 
by the Fermi telescope.
Finding Favor and Flaw with 
Loop Quantum Gravity
As with string theory, loop quantum gravity is passionately embraced by 
some physicists and dismissed by others. The physicists who study it believe 
that the predictions (described in the preceding section) are far better 
than those made by string theory. One major argument in support of LQG 
is that it’s seen by its adherents as a finite theory, meaning that the theory 
itself doesn’t inherently admit infinities. These same researchers also tend 
to dismiss the flaws as being the product of insufficient work (and funding) 
devoted to the theory. String theorists, in turn, view them as much a victim of 
“groupthink” as critics view string theorists.
The benefit of a finite theorem
One major benefit of loop quantum gravity is that the theory has been proved 
finite in a more definitive sense than string theory has. Lee Smolin, one of 
the key (and certainly most high profile) researchers of LQG, describes in 
his book The Trouble with Physics three distinct ways that the theory is finite 
(with string theorist objections in parentheses):

319
 Chapter 18: Loop Quantum Gravity: String Theory’s Biggest Competitor
	
✓	The areas and volumes in loop quantum gravity are always in finite, 
discrete units. (String theorists would say this isn’t a particularly 
meaningful form of finiteness.)
	
✓	In the Barrett-Crane model of loop quantum gravity, the probabilities for 
a quantum geometry to evolve into different histories are always finite. 
(This sounds just like unitarity, which is a property of string theory and 
all quantum field theories.)
	
✓	Including gravity in a loop quantum gravity theory that contains matter 
theory, like the Standard Model, involves no infinite expressions. If 
gravity is excluded, you have to do some tinkering to avoid them. (String 
theorists believe this claim is premature and that there are substantial 
problems with the proposed LQG models that yield this result.)
As I explain in Chapter 17, some questions exist (largely brought up by loop 
quantum gravity theorists) about whether string theory is actually finite — 
or, more specifically, over whether it has been rigorously proved finite. From 
the theoretical side of things, the loop quantum gravity people view this 
uncertainty as a major victory over string theory. (String theorists would 
argue that the statements above still don’t prove that LQG can’t result in an 
infinite solution when experimental data is put into the theory.)
Spending some time focusing on the flaws
Many of the flaws in loop quantum gravity are the same flaws in string 
theory. Their predictions generally extend into realms that aren’t quite 
testable yet (although LQG is a bit closer to being able to be experimentally 
tested than string theory probably is). Also, it’s not really clear that loop 
quantum gravity is any more falsifiable than string theory. For example, the 
discovery of supersymmetry or extra dimensions won’t disprove loop 
quantum gravity any more than the failure to detect them will disprove 
string theory. (The only discovery that I think LQG would have a hard time 
overcoming would be if black holes are observed and Hawking radiation proves 
to be false, which would be a problem for any quantum gravity theory, 
including string theory.)
The biggest flaw in loop quantum gravity is that it has yet to successfully 
show that you can take a quantized space and extract a smooth space-time 
out of it. In fact, the entire method of adding time into the spin network 
seems somewhat contrived to some critics, although whether it’s any more 
contrived than the entirely background-dependent formulation of string 
theory remains to be seen.
The quantum theory of space-time in loop quantum gravity is really just a 
quantum theory of space. The spin network described by the theory cannot 
yet incorporate time. Some, such as Lee Smolin, believe that time will prove 

320
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
to be a necessary and fundamental component of the theory, while Carlo 
Rovelli believes that the theory will ultimately show that time doesn’t really 
exist, but is just an emergent property without a real existence on its own. 
These and other disputes over the meaning of time are addressed in Chapter 16.
So Are These Two Theories the Same 
with Different Names?
One viewpoint is that both string theory and loop quantum gravity may 
actually represent the same theory approached from different directions. 
The parallels between the theories are numerous:
	
✓	String theory began as a theory of particle interactions, but was shown 
to contain gravity. Loop quantum gravity began as a theory of gravity, 
but was shown to contain particles.
	
✓	In string theory, space-time can be viewed as a mesh of interacting 
strings and branes, much like the threads of a fabric. In loop quantum 
gravity, threads of space are woven together, creating the apparently 
“smooth” fabric of space-time.
	
✓	Some string theorists believe the compactified dimensions represent a 
fundamental quantum unit of space, while LQG starts with units of space 
as an initial requirement.
	
✓	Both theories (provided certain assumptions are made) calculate the 
same entropy for black holes.
One way to view the differences is that string theory, which began by 
applying principles from particle physics, may point toward a universe in 
which space-time emerges from the behavior of these fundamental strings. 
LQG, on the other hand, began by applying general relativity principles and 
results in a world where space-time is fundamental, but matter and gravity 
may emerge from the behavior of these fundamental units.
At one time, Lee Smolin was one of the major supporters of the viewpoint 
that string theory, M-theory, and loop quantum gravity were different 
approximations of the same underlying fundamental theory. Over the last 
decade, he has become largely disillusioned with string theory (at least 
compared to his earlier conciliatory stance), becoming a prominent advocate 
of pursuing other avenues of inquiry.
Some string theorists believe that the methods used by LQG will eventually 
be carried over to string theory, allowing for a background-independent 
version of string theory. This is very probable, especially given that the 
string theory landscape seems capable of absorbing virtually any viable 
theory and incorporating it as a part of string theory.

321
 Chapter 18: Loop Quantum Gravity: String Theory’s Biggest Competitor
Despite the possible harmony between the two fields, at the moment they are 
competitors for research funding and attention. String theorists have their 
conferences, and loop quantum gravity people have their conferences, and 
rarely shall the two conferences meet. (Except for Lee Smolin, who seems to 
have rather enjoyed flitting over to the string theory side of things over the 
years.) All too often, the groups seem unable to speak to each other in any 
meaningful way (see the nearby sidebar, “The ‘Big Bang’ breakup”).
Part of the problem is one of sociology. Many string theorists, even in 
research papers, use phrases that make it clear they consider string theory 
to not only be their preferred theory, but to be the only (or, in cases where 
they’re being more generous, the “most promising”) theory of quantum 
gravity. By doing this, they often dismiss LQG as even being an option. 
Some string theorists have indicated in interviews that they are completely 
unaware of any viable alternatives to string theory! (This is because string 
theorists aren’t yet convinced that the alternatives are actually viable.)
Hopefully, these physicists will find a way to work together and use their 
results and techniques in ways that provide real insights into the nature of 
our own universe. But so far, loop quantum gravity, like string theory, is still 
stuck on the drawing board.
The “Big Bang” breakup
The conflict between loop quantum gravity and 
string theory enthusiasts made it into popu­
lar culture in an episode of the CBS television 
sitcom The Big Bang Theory, which focuses on 
two physicist roommates, Leonard and Sheldon. 
In the second episode of the second season, 
Leonard has begun a relationship with a physicist 
colleague, Leslie Winkle, a rival of Sheldon (or 
“nemesis,” as he thinks of her). Leslie Winkle, 
you see, is a researcher in loop quantum gravity, 
while Sheldon is a string theorist.
In the climactic scene of the episode, Sheldon 
and Leslie get into a “string war” of their own, 
slinging theoretical physics barbs at each 
other. Their conflict is over which theory — 
loop quantum gravity or string theory — has the 
greatest probability of successfully achieving a 
quantum theory of gravity. The argument ends 
in Leonard being placed in the middle, being 
forced to point out that they are two untested 
theories of quantum gravity, so he has no way to 
choose. Leslie is shocked and appalled by this 
response, immediately ending the relationship 
with Leonard.
Although this is obviously played up for comedy 
purposes, among the physics community the 
funniest thing about it was how much truth there 
actually was in the scenario. When physicists 
get into passionate debates about loop 
quantum gravity versus string theory, all too 
often the first casualty seems to be reasonable 
discourse.

n the event that string theory proves false, or that there is no “theory 
of everything” at all, there are still some unexplained phenomena in the 
universe that require explanation. These issues mostly lie in the realm of 
cosmology, such as the flatness problem, dark matter, dark energy, and the 
details of the early universe.
Even though string theory is currently the dominant path being explored to 
answer most of these problems, some physicists have begun looking in other 
directions, beyond the loop quantum gravity described in Chapter 18. These 
rebels (and, at times, outcasts) have refused, in many cases, to stick with the 
mainstream theoretical community in adopting the principles of string theory 
and have proposed new directions of inquiry that are, at times, extremely 
radical — though possibly no more radical, in their own ways, than string 
theory was in the 1970s.
In this chapter, I explain some of the alternative approaches that physicists 
are looking into in an effort to explain the problems that physicists want to 
resolve. First, I explore some alternate quantum gravity theories, none of 
which are quite as fully developed as either string theory or loop quantum 
gravity. Next, I show you how physicists have suggested modifying the 
existing law of general relativity to take into account the facts that don’t fit 
with Einstein’s original model. It’s possible that some of the ideas from this 
chapter will ultimately be incorporated into string theory, or perhaps take its 
place entirely.

324
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
Taking Other Roads to Quantum Gravity
Though string theorists like to point out that theirs is the most developed 
theory to unite general relativity and quantum physics (at times they even 
seem clueless that alternatives exist), sometimes it seems like nearly every 
physicist has come up with some plan to combine the two — they just don’t 
have the support that string theorists have.
	
Most of these alternate theories start with the same idea as loop quantum 
gravity — that space is made up of small, discrete units that somehow work 
together to provide the space-time that we all know and love (relatively 
speaking, that is). Despite the fact that scientists don’t know much about 
these units of space, some theorists can analyze how they might behave and 
use that information to generate useful models.
Here are some examples of these other quantum gravity approaches:
	
✓	Causal dynamical triangulations (CDT): CDT models space-time as 
being made up of tiny building blocks, called 4-simplices, which are 
identical and can reconfigure themselves into different curvature 
configurations.
	
✓	Quantum Einstein gravity (or “asymptotic safety”): Quantum Einstein 
gravity assumes that there’s a point where “zooming in” on space-time 
stops increasing the force of gravity.
	
✓	Quantum graphity: In the quantum graphity model, gravity didn’t exist 
in the earliest moments of the universe because space itself doesn’t 
exist on the small length and high energy scales involved in the early 
universe.
	
✓	Internal relativity: This model predicts that you can start with a 
random distribution of quantum spins and get the laws of general 
relativity to come out of it.
	
Of course, any of these approaches could advance either string theory or
 loop quantum gravity, instead of leading off in a new direction. Some of the 
principles may prove fruitful, but only when applied in the framework of one 
of the other theories. Only time will tell what insights, if any, come out of them 
and if they can be applied to give meaningful results.
Causal dynamical triangulations (CDT): 
If you’ve got the time, I’ve got the space
The causal dynamical triangulations approach consists of taking tiny 
building blocks of space, called 4-simplices (sort of like multidimensional 
triangles), and using them to construct the space-time geometry. The result 

325
 Chapter 19: Considering Other Ways to Explain the Universe
is a sequence of geometric patterns that are causally related in a sequence 
where one construction follows another (in other words, one pattern causes 
the next pattern). This system was developed by Renate Loll of Utrecht 
University in the Netherlands, and also by colleagues Jan Ambjørn and Jerzy 
Jurkiewicz.
One of the most important aspects of CDT is that time becomes an essential 
component of space-time, because Loll includes the causal link as a crucial 
part of the theory. Relativity tells us that time is distinctly different from 
space (as mentioned in Chapter 13, the time dimension has a negative in 
front of it in relativity), but Stephen Hawking and others have suggested that 
the difference between time and space could perhaps be ignored.
Loll then takes her causally linked configurations of 4-simplices and sums 
over all possible configurations of the shapes. (Feynman used a similar 
approach in quantum mechanics, summing over all possible paths to obtain 
quantum physics results.) The result is classical space-time geometry!
	
If true, CDT shows that it’s impossible to ignore the difference between space 
and time. The causal link of changes in space-time geometry — in other words, 
the “time” part of space-time — is absolutely necessary to get classical space-
time geometry that is governed by general relativity and matches what science 
knows of standard cosmological models.
	
At the tiniest scales, though, CDT shows that space-time is only 2-dimensional. 
The model turns into a fractal pattern, where the structures repeat themselves 
at smaller and smaller scales, and there’s no proof that real space-time 
behaves that way.
CDT’s biggest flaw in comparison to string theory is that it doesn’t tell us 
anything about where matter comes from, whereas matter arises naturally in 
string theory from the interactions of fundamental strings.
Quantum Einstein gravity: Too small to tug
Quantum Einstein gravity, developed by Martin Reuter of the University of 
Mainz in Germany, tries to apply the quantum physics processes that worked 
on other forces to gravity. Reuter believes that at small scales, gravity may 
have a cutoff point where its strength stops increasing. (This notion was 
proposed by Steven Weinberg in the 1970s, under the more common name 
“asymptotic safety.”)
One reason to think that gravity stops increasing at small scales is that this is 
what quantum field theory tells us the other forces do. At very small scales, 
even the strong nuclear force drops to zero. This is called asymptotic freedom, 
and its discovery earned David Gross, David Politzer, and Frank Wilczek 
the 2004 Nobel Prize. The force of gravity wouldn’t go to zero but rather to 

326
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
some finite strength (stronger than we usually see), and this idea is known as 
asymptotic safety.
Weinberg and others weren’t able to pursue the idea at the time because 
the mathematical tools to calculate the cutoff point for gravity in general 
relativity didn’t exist until Reuter developed them in the 1990s. Though the 
method is approximate, Reuter has a great deal of confidence.
Quantum Einstein gravity, like CDT, comes up with a fractal pattern to small-
scale space-time, and the number of dimensions drops to two. Reuter himself 
has noted that this could mean that his approach is fundamentally equivalent 
to CDT, because they both have these rather distinctive predictions at small 
scales.
The idea of asymptotic safety is really a very conservative solution to the 
problem of quantum gravity. Unlike the other approaches that introduce 
some radically new physics that would take over from general relativity at 
high energies (or equivalently at short distances), it proposes a well-defined 
strongly interacting theory of gravity at high energies in which the usual 
general relativity is simply augmented by some extra interactions for the 
graviton.
Quantum graphity: Disconnecting nodes
Quantum graphity has been developed by Fotini Markopoulou of the 
Perimeter Institute. In some ways, this is loop quantum gravity taken to its 
extreme — at extremely high energies all that exists is the network of nodes.
This model is based on a suggestion by John Archibald Wheeler about a 
pre-geometric phase to the universe, which Markopoulou takes literally. The 
nodes in the pre-geometric phase would all touch each other, but as the 
universe cooled, they would disconnect from each other and become 
separated, resulting in the space that we see today. (Physicists working on 
string theory have also found this sort of pre-geometric phase, so it’s not 
unique to Markopoulou’s approach.)
It’s also possible that this could explain the horizon problem, the problem 
that distant parts of the universe seem to be the same temperature. In the 
quantum graphity model, all points used to be in direct contact, so inflation 
proves to be unnecessary. (See Chapter 9 for more about the horizon 
problem and how inflation solves it.) At present, inflation is a much more 
well-defined theory, but Markopoulou is working on developing quantum 
graphity to compete with it.

327
 Chapter 19: Considering Other Ways to Explain the Universe
Internal relativity: Spinning 
the universe into existence
The final quantum gravity model, internal relativity, may be the most 
ambitious, because Olaf Dreyer of MIT believes that a random distribution of 
quantum spins may end up resulting in our whole universe. For this to work, 
Dreyer considers the view of observers inside the system. The approach has 
shown that these observers would witness some aspects of special relativity, 
such as time dilation and length contraction, but Dreyer is still working on 
getting general relativity out of the equations. (Isn’t everybody?)
The space-time and matter are a result of the excitations of the system, which 
is one reason Dreyer is hopeful. He believes that the reason quantum physics 
yields an incorrect prediction for the cosmological constant is because of a 
split between space-time and matter. Internal relativity links the two concepts, 
so the calculations have to be performed differently.
Dreyer has predicted that his model would show no gravity waves in the 
cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), while inflation theory 
would result in CMBR gravity waves. It is hoped that the Planck satellite will 
be able to detect any gravity waves in the CMBR — or not detect them, as 
Dreyer’s theory predicts.
The Perimeter Institute
If you follow theoretical physics, it isn’t long 
until you hear about the Perimeter Institute 
for Theoretical Physics, located in Waterloo, 
Ontario, Canada. The Perimeter Institute was 
founded in 1999 by Mike Lazaridis, who was 
founder and co-CEO of Research in Motion, 
the makers of the BlackBerry handheld device. 
Lazaridis decided to help foster research and 
innovation in Canada by starting the Perimeter 
Institute, which is devoted purely to theoretical 
physics research.
Many of the prominent critics of string theory 
who are working on other approaches — Lee 
Smolin, John Moffat, Fotini Markopoulou, and 
others — call it home, so it’s easy to believe 
that the Perimeter Institute seeks out anti-string 
theorists. In fact, their current director is Neil 
Turok, a cosmologist and co-creator of the 
ekpyrotic model, which is based on string theory 
principles. The Perimeter Institute achieved 
quite a coup by hiring Stephen Hawking as a 
Distinguished Research Chair, followed by a 
slew of other prominent physicists.
The Perimeter Institute’s goal is to foster 
innovation, and the physicists work in a number 
of areas: cosmology, particle physics, quantum 
foundations, quantum gravity, quantum 
information theory, and superstring theory. 
It’s one of the only places where string 
theorists and leaders in other quantum gravity 
approaches regularly work together in one 
institute. More information on the Perimeter 
Institute can be found at www.perimeter
institute.ca.

Newton and Einstein Don’t Make All the 
Rules: Modifying the Law of Gravity
Instead of trying to develop theories of quantum gravity, some physicists are 
looking at the existing law of gravity and trying to find specific modifications 
that will make it work to explain the current mysteries of cosmology. 
These efforts are largely motivated by attempts to find alternatives to the 
cosmological theories of inflation, dark matter, or dark energy.
	
These approaches don’t necessarily resolve the conflicts between quantum 
physics and general relativity, but in many cases they make the conflict less 
important. The approaches tend to result in singularities and infinities falling 
out of the theories, so there just isn’t as much need for a theory of quantum 
gravity.
Doubly special relativity (DSR): Twice 
as many limits as ordinary relativity
One intriguing approach is doubly special relativity or deformed special 
relativity (abbreviated as DSR either way you slice it), originally developed 
by Giovanni Amelino-Camelia. In special relativity, the speed of light is 
constant for all observers. In DSR theories, all observers also agree on one 
other thing — the distance of the Planck length.
	
In Einstein’s relativity, the constancy of the speed of light places an upper 
speed limit on everything in the universe. In DSR theories, the Planck length 
represents a lower limit on distance. Nothing can go faster than the speed of 
light, and nothing can be smaller than a Planck length. The principles of DSR 
may be applicable to various quantum gravity models, such as loop quantum 
gravity, though so far there’s no proof for it.
Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND): 
Disregarding dark matter
Some physicists aren’t comfortable with the idea of dark matter and have 
proposed alternative explanations to resolve the problems that make 
physicists believe dark matter exists. One of these explanations, which 
involves looking at gravity in a new way on large scales, is called modified 
Newtonian dynamics (MOND).

329
 Chapter 19: Considering Other Ways to Explain the Universe
The basic premise of MOND is that at low values, the force of gravity doesn’t 
follow the rules laid out by Newton more than 300 years ago. The relationship 
between force and acceleration in these cases may turn out not to be exactly 
linear, and MOND predicts a relationship that will yield the results observed 
based on only the visible mass for galaxies.
In Newtonian mechanics (or, for that matter, in general relativity, which 
reduces to Newtonian mechanics at this scale), the gravitational relationships 
between objects are precisely defined based on their masses and the distance 
between them. When the amount of visible matter for galaxies is put into 
these equations, physicists get answers that show that the visible matter 
just doesn’t produce enough gravity to hold the galaxies together. In fact, 
according to Newtonian mechanics, the outer edges of the galaxies should 
be rotating much faster, causing the stars farther out to fly away from the 
galaxy.
Because scientists know the distances involved, the assumption is that 
somehow the amount of matter has been underestimated. A natural response 
to this (and the one that most physicists have adopted) is that there must be 
some other sort of matter that isn’t visible to us: dark matter.
	
There is one other alternative — the distances and matter are correct, but 
the relationship between them is incorrect. MOND was proposed by Israeli 
physicist Mordehai Milgrom in 1981 as a means of explaining the galactic 
behavior without resorting to dark matter.
Most physicists have ruled MOND out, because the dark matter theories 
seem to fit the facts more closely. Milgrom, however, has not given up, and in 
2009 he made predictions about slight variations in the path of planets based 
on his MOND calculations. It remains to be seen if these variations will be 
observed.
Variable speed of light (VSL): Light 
used to travel even faster
In two separate efforts, physicists have developed a system where the speed 
of light actually would not be constant, as a means of explaining the horizon 
problem without the need of inflation. The earliest system of the variable 
speed of light (VSL) was proposed by John Moffat (who later incorporated the 
idea into his modified gravity theory), and a later system was developed by 
João Magueijo and Andreas Albrecht.

330
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
The horizon problem is based on the idea that distant regions of the universe 
couldn’t communicate their temperatures because they are so far apart light 
hasn’t had time to get from one to the other. The solution proposed by 
inflation theory is that the regions were once much closer together, so they 
could communicate (see Chapter 9 for more on this).
	
In VSL theories, another alternative is proposed: The two regions could 
communicate because light traveled faster in the past than it does now.
Moffat proposed his VSL model in 1992, allowing for the speed of light in the 
early universe to be very large — about 100,000 trillion trillion times the 
current values. This would allow for all regions of the observable universe to 
easily communicate with each other.
To get this to work out, Moffat had to make a conjecture that the Lorentz 
invariance — the basic symmetry of special relativity — was somehow 
spontaneously broken in the early universe. Moffat’s prediction results in a 
period of rapid heat transfer throughout the universe that results in the same 
effects as an inflationary model.
In 1998, physicist João Magueijo came up with a similar theory, in 
collaboration with Aldreas Albrecht. Their approach, developed without any 
knowledge of Moffat’s work, was very similar — which they acknowledged 
upon learning of it. This work was published a bit more prominently than 
Moffat’s (largely because they were more stubborn about pursuing 
Proving dark matter wrong?
In August 2008, a group of astrophysicists 
published a paper called “A Direct Empirical 
Proof of the Existence of Dark Matter.” The 
“proof” they speak of came from an impact 
between two galaxy clusters. Using NASA’s 
Chandra X-Ray Observatory, they were able 
to see gravitational lensing (the gravity of the 
collision caused light to bend, kind of how light 
bends when it passes through a lens), which let 
them determine the center of the collision. The 
center of the collision did not match the center 
of the visible matter. In other words, the center 
of gravity and the center of visible matter didn’t 
match. That’s pretty conclusive evidence for 
there being nonvisible matter, right?
In the world of theoretical physics, nothing 
is quite that easy these days. By September, 
physicist John Moffat and others were beginning 
to cast doubt on whether dark matter was 
the only explanation. Using his own modified 
gravity (MOG) theory, Moffat performed a 
calculation on a simplified 1-dimensional 
version of the collision.
Most physicists accept the NASA findings, 
including more recent findings from WMAP 
and other observations, as conclusive evidence 
that dark matter exists. But there remain those 
who are unconvinced and search for other 
explanations.

331
 Chapter 19: Considering Other Ways to Explain the Universe
publication in the prestigious Physical Review D, which had rejected Moffat’s 
earlier paper). This later work has inspired others, such as Cambridge physi­
cist John Barrow, to begin investigating this idea.
One piece of support for VSL approaches is that recent research by John 
Webb and others has indicated that the fine-structure constant may not have 
always been constant. The fine-structure constant is a ratio made up from 
Planck’s constant, the charge on the electron, and the speed of light. It’s a 
value that shows up in some physical equations. If the fine-structure constant 
has changed over time, then at least one of these values (and possibly more 
than one) has also been changing.
The spectral lines emitted by atoms are defined by Planck’s constant. 
Scientists know from observations that these spectral lines haven’t changed, 
so it’s unlikely that Planck’s constant has changed. (Thanks to John Moffat 
for clearing that up.) Still, any change in the fine-structure constant could be 
explained by varying either the speed of light or the electron charge (or both).
Physicists Elias Kiritsis and Stephon Alexander independently developed VSL 
models that could be incorporated into string theory, and Alexander later 
worked with Magueijo on refining these concepts (even though Magueijo is 
critical of string theory’s lack of contact with experiment).
	
These proposals are intriguing, but the physics community in general remains 
committed to the inflation model. Both VSL and inflation require some strange 
behavior in the early moments of the universe, but it’s unclear that inflation is 
inherently more realistic than VSL. It’s possible that further evidence of varying 
constants will ultimately lead to support of VSL over inflation, but that day 
seems a long way off, if it ever happens.
Modified gravity (MOG): The bigger 
the distance, the greater the gravity
John Moffat’s work in alternative gravity has resulted in his modified 
gravity (MOG) theories, in which the force of gravity increases over distance, 
and also the introduction of a new repulsive force at even larger distances. 
Moffat’s MOG actually consists of three different theories that he has 
developed over the span of three decades, trying to make them simpler and 
more elegant and more accessible for other physicists to work on.
This work began in 1979, when Moffat developed nonsymmetric gravitational 
theory (NGT), which extended work that Einstein tried to apply to create a 
unified field theory in the context of a non-Riemannian geometry. The work 
had failed to unify gravity and electromagnetics, like Einstein wanted, but 
Moffat believed that it could be used to generalize relativity itself.

332
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
Over the years, NGT ultimately proved inconclusive. It was possible that its 
predictions (such as the idea that the sun deviated from a perfectly spherical 
shape) was incorrect or that the deviation was too small to be observed.
In 2003, Moffat developed an alternative with the unwieldy name Metric-Skew-
Tensor Gravity (MSTG). This was a symmetric theory (easier to deal with), 
which included a “skew” field for the nonsymmetric part. This new field was, 
in fact, a fundamentally new force — a fifth fundamental force in the universe.
Unfortunately, this theory remained too mathematically complicated in 
the eyes of many, so in 2004 Moffat developed Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity 
(STVG). In STVG, Moffat again had a fifth force resulting from a vector field 
called a phion field. The phion particle was the gauge boson that carried the 
fifth force in the theory.
	
According to Moffat, all three theories give essentially the same results for 
weak gravity fields, like those we normally observe. The strong gravitational 
fields needed to distinguish the theories are the ones that always give 
scientists problems and have motivated the search for quantum gravity 
theories in the first place. They can be found at the moment of the big bang 
or during the stellar collapses that may cause black holes.
There are indications that STVG yields results very similar to Milgrom’s 
MOND theory (refer to the earlier section “Modified Newtonian dynamics 
(MOND): Disregarding dark matter” for a fuller explanation of MOND). Moffat 
has proposed that MOG may actually explain dark matter and dark energy, 
and that black holes may not actually exist in nature.
	
While these implications are amazing, the work is still in the very preliminary 
stages, and it will likely be years before it (or any of the other theories) 
is developed enough to have any hope of seriously competing with the 
entrenched viewpoints.
Rewriting the Math Books and Physics 
Books at the Same Time
Revolutions in physics have frequently had an assist from revolutions in 
mathematics years before. One of the problems with string theory is that it 
has advanced so quickly that the mathematical tools didn’t actually exist. 
Physicists have been forced (with the aid of some brilliant mathematicians) 
to develop the tools as they go.

333
 Chapter 19: Considering Other Ways to Explain the Universe
Einstein got help in developing general relativity from Riemannian geometry, 
developed years earlier. Quantum physics was built on a framework of new 
mathematical representations of physical symmetries, group representation 
theory, as developed by the mathematician Hermann Weyl.
In addition to developing the physics needed to address problems of 
quantum gravity, some physicists and mathematicians have tried to focus 
on developing whole new mathematical techniques. The question remains, 
though, how (and if) these techniques could be applied to the theoretical 
frameworks to get meaningful results.
Compute this: Quantum information theory
One technique that is growing in popularity as a means of looking at the 
universe is quantum information theory, which deals with all elements in the 
universe as pieces of information. This approach was originally proposed 
by John Archibald Wheeler with the phrase “It from bit,” indicating that all 
matter in the universe can be viewed as essentially pieces of information. (A 
bit is a unit of information stored in a computer.)
Some of the leaders in this approach are Fotini Markopoulou of the Perimeter 
Institute and Seth Lloyd of MIT, who approach the problem from rather 
different directions. Markopoulou studies quantum gravity theories, while 
Lloyd is best known for having figured out how to build a quantum computer. 
(Quantum computers are like ordinary computers, but instead of using just 
two bits for information storage, they use quantum physics to have a whole 
host of in-between information. A quantum bit of information is called a 
qubit.)
Overall, this approach basically treats the universe as a giant computer — in 
fact, a universe-sized quantum computer. The major benefit of this system is 
that, for a computer scientist, it’s easy to see how random information sent 
through a series of computations results in complexity growing over time. 
The complexity within our universe could thus arise from the universe 
performing logical operations — calculations, if you will — upon the pieces of 
information (be they loops of space-time or strings) within the universe.
If you want to know more about quantum information theory, or quantum 
computers for that matter, you can read about it in Seth Lloyd’s 2006 physics 
book, Programming the Universe: A Quantum Computer Scientist Takes on the 
Cosmos, which should be accessible if you’ve followed the science in this 
book.

334
Part V: What the Other Guys Say: Criticisms and Alternatives 
Looking at relationships: Twistor theory
For nearly four decades, the brilliant physicist Sir Roger Penrose has been 
exploring his own mathematical approach — twistor theory. Penrose 
developed the theory out of a strong general relativity approach (the theory 
requires only four dimensions). Penrose maintains a belief that any theory 
of quantum gravity will need to include fundamental revisions to the way 
physicists think about quantum mechanics, something with which most 
particle physicists and string theorists disagree.
One of the key aspects of twistor theory is that the relation between events 
in space-time is crucial. Instead of focusing on the events and their resulting 
relationships, twistor theory focuses on the causal relationships, and the 
events become byproducts of those relationships.
If you take all of the light rays in space-time, it creates a twistor space, which 
is the mathematical universe in which twistor theory resides. In fact, there 
are some indications that objects in twistor space may result in objects and 
events in our universe.
	
The major flaw of twistor theory is that even after all of these years (it was 
originally developed in the 1960s), it still only exists in a world absent of 
quantum physics. The space-time of twistor theory is perfectly smooth, so 
it allows no discrete structure of space-time. It’s a sort of anti-quantum 
gravity, which means it doesn’t provide much more help than general 
relativity in resolving the issues that string theorists (or other quantum 
gravity researchers) are trying to solve.
As with string theory, Penrose’s twistor theory has provided some mathematical 
insights into the existing theories of physics, including some that lie at the 
heart of the Standard Model of particle physics.
Edward Witten and other string theorists have begun to investigate ways that 
twistor theory may relate to string theory. One approach has been to have 
the strings exist not in physical space, but in twistor space. So far, it hasn’t 
yielded the relationships that would provide fundamental breakthroughs in 
either string theory or twistor theory, but it has resulted in great improvements 
of calculational techniques in quantum chromodynamics.
Uniting mathematical systems: 
Noncommutative geometry
Another mathematical tool being developed is the noncommutative geometry of 
French mathematician Alain Connes, a winner of the prestigious Fields Medal. 
This system involves treating the geometry in a fundamentally new way, using 
mathematical systems where the commutative principle doesn’t hold.

335
 Chapter 19: Considering Other Ways to Explain the Universe
In mathematics, two quantities commute if operations on those quantities 
work the same way no matter what order you treat them. Addition and 
multiplication are both commutative because you get the same answer no 
matter what order you add two numbers or multiply them.
However, mathematicians are a diverse bunch, and some mathematical 
systems exist where addition and multiplication are defined differently, so 
the order does matter. As weird as it sounds, in these systems multiplying 5 
by 3 could give a different result than multiplying 3 by 5. (I don’t recommend 
using this excuse to argue with a teacher over the scores on a math test.) It’s 
probably not surprising to discover that these noncommutative mathematical 
systems come up frequently in the bizarre world of quantum mechanics — 
in fact, this feature is the mathematical cause of the uncertainty principle 
described in Chapter 7.
The tools of noncommutative geometry have been used in many approaches, 
but Connes seeks a more fundamental unification of algebra and geometry 
that could be used to build a physical model where the conflicts are resolved 
by features inherent in the mathematical system.
Noncommutative geometry has had some success, because the Standard 
Model of particle physics seems to pop out of it in the simplest versions. 
The goal of the committed mathematicians working with Connes is that they 
will eventually be able to replicate all of physics (including possibly string 
theory), though that is likely still a long way off. (Are you beginning to see a 
pattern here?)

Ten Questions a Theory of 
Everything Should (Ideally) 
Answer
In This Chapter
▶	Hoping to unlock the secrets of the origin and end of the universe
▶	Wondering why our universe has the parameters it does
▶	Seeking explanations for dark matter, dark energy, and other mysteries
A
ny “theory of everything” — whether it be string theory or something 
else — would need to answer some of the most difficult questions that 
physics has ever asked. These questions are so difficult that the combined 
efforts of the entire physics community have so far been unable to answer 
them. Most physicists have, historically, believed that a theory of everything 
would provide a unique reason why the universe is the way it is — as 
opposed to the anthropic principle, which is based on our universe not being 
unique. Many physicists today question whether there can ever be a single 
theory that answers all of these questions.
In this chapter, I consider the questions of what started the universe, 
including why the early universe had exactly the properties it had. This 
includes the solutions to other questions of cosmology, such as the nature 
of black holes, dark matter, and dark energy. I also explore the problem of 
understanding what really happens in the strange realm of quantum physics. 
Finally, I discuss the need for a fundamental explanation of time and a 
reasonable look ahead at the end of the universe.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The Big Bang: What Banged 
(and Inflated)?
Currently, physics and cosmology tell us that the universe as we know it 
started about 14 billion or so years ago, in a singularity at which the laws of 
physics break down. Most scientists believe in a rapid inflation that occurred 
moments afterward, expanding space rapidly. When the inflation period 
slowed down, we entered into a period where space continued to expand at 
the rate we see today (or a bit less, given dark energy’s influences).
This breaks the question of the universe’s origin into two parts:
	
✓	What were the initial conditions that triggered the big bang?
	
✓	What caused the repulsive gravity of the inflation era to end?
In Chapter 14, I offer some explanations for how string theory can solve these 
questions. Even if string theory fails, any theory that attempts to expand 
beyond the Standard Model of particle physics will need to tackle these 
questions regarding the early moments of the universe.
Baryon Asymmetry: Why 
Does Matter Exist?
After the big bang, raw energy was transformed into matter. If the energy of 
the early universe had cooled into equal amounts of matter and antimatter, 
these different forms of matter would have annihilated each other, leaving 
no matter in the universe. Instead, there was substantially more matter than 
antimatter, enough so that when all the antimatter had been annihilated by 
matter, enough matter was left to make up the visible universe. This early 
difference between matter and antimatter is called baryon asymmetry 
(because regular matter, made up of baryons, is called baryonic matter).
The laws of physics provide no clear reason why the amounts of matter and 
antimatter wouldn’t have been equal, so presumably a theory of everything 
would explain why the dense energy of the early universe tended to favor — 
even if only by a little bit — matter over antimatter.

341
 Chapter 20: Ten Questions a Theory of Everything Should (Ideally) Answer
Hierarchy Issues: Why Are There Gaps in 
Forces, Particles, and Energy Levels?
Most physicists, if they were to set out to create a universe, would have been 
a bit more conservative with their resources than the forces at work in our 
universe seem to have been. There are a wide range of force intensities, 
ranging from the incredibly weak gravitational force to the strong nuclear 
force that binds quarks together into protons and neutrons. The particles 
themselves come in multiple varieties — far more varieties than we seem 
to need — and each variety jumps by large multiples in size. Instead of a 
smooth continuum of forces, particles, and energy, there are huge gaps.
A theory of everything should explain why these gaps exist and why they 
exist where they do.
Fine-Tuning: Why Do Fundamental 
Constants Have the Values They Do?
Many of the fundamental constants in our universe seem precisely set in the 
range that allows life to form. This is one reason why some physicists have 
been turning toward the anthropic principle, because it so readily explains 
this fact.
Physicists hope, however, that a theory of everything would explain the 
precision of these values — in essence, explain the reason why life itself is 
allowed to exist in our universe — from fundamental principles of physics.
Black Hole Information Paradox: What 
Happens to Missing Black Hole Matter?
The current thinking on the black hole information paradox is that there is 
a quantum system underlying the black hole, and that this quantum system 
never loses information, though the system can mix up the finer points in a 
complicated way. To reconcile this picture with Hawking’s calculations 

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
(see Chapter 14), the concept of complementarity is sometimes invoked. This 
idea, proposed by Leonard Susskind, says that someone outside the black 
hole may observe different results than someone falling into the black hole, 
but that no contradictions will arise.
This approach hasn’t settled the problem for everyone, including physicists 
who believe that relativity should hold more sway than quantum mechanics. 
Whatever the solution, a theory of everything would have to present a 
definitive set of rules that could be applied to figure out what’s happening to 
matter (and information) that falls into a black hole.
Quantum Interpretation: What Does 
Quantum Mechanics Mean?
Though quantum mechanics works to explain the results seen in laboratory 
experiments, there’s still not a single clear description of the physical 
principle that causes it to work the way it does. Though this is tied to the 
“collapse of the quantum wavefunction,” the exact physical meaning of the 
wavefunction, or of its collapse, remains a bit of a mystery. (So if you don’t 
understand quantum physics, don’t worry . . . physicists are still debating it, 
even after all these years.)
In Chapter 7, I explain some of the interpretations of what this may mean — 
the Copenhagen interpretation, the many worlds interpretation (MWI), 
consistent histories, and so on — but the fact is that these are just guesses, 
and physicists really don’t know for sure what’s going on with this strange 
quantum behavior. Lee Smolin listed this as his second “great problem in 
theoretical physics.” Though today this is by far the minority opinion among 
physicists, the great physicists of the quantum revolution — Bohr, Einstein, 
Heisenberg, Schroedinger, and the rest — also saw it as a key question to 
resolve.
Today, most physicists tend to just trust in the math and don’t worry about 
strange things happening behind the scenes. They are perfectly comfortable 
with quantum mechanics, seeing nothing mysterious in the behavior. (After 
all, they have equations that describe it!)
In fact, the majority of theoretical physicists don’t seem to believe that it’s 
possible to determine one interpretation as correct, and don’t even consider 
it as a question that needs to be answered, even by a theory of everything. 
Some of those who do want a clear interpretation hope that a theory of 
everything will provide insights into the physical mechanism explaining 
quantum phenomena.

343
 Chapter 20: Ten Questions a Theory of Everything Should (Ideally) Answer
Dark Mystery No. 1: What Is Dark 
Matter (and Why Is There So Much)?
There appear to be two forms of matter in the universe: visible matter and 
dark matter. Scientists know dark matter exists because they can detect its 
gravitational effects, but they can’t currently observe dark matter directly. If 
extra matter weren’t there to hold galaxies together, the equations of general 
relativity show that they would fly apart.
Still, no one knows what the dark matter is made of. Some theorize that the 
dark matter may be stable superpartners of our known particles — perhaps 
photinos, the superpartner of the photon. String theory contains other ideas, 
covered in Chapter 14, that could explain the nature of dark matter.
But the fact is that no one knows for sure, which is disturbing because there 
is about five times as much dark matter as there is visible matter in the 
universe. So there should be a lot of it around to study — if only physicists 
and their scientific theories could see it for what it really is.
Dark Mystery No. 2: What Is Dark 
Energy (and Why Is It So Weak)?
There’s a lot of dark energy in the universe — about three times as much as 
visible matter and dark matter put together! This energy represents a repulsive 
force of gravity on large scales, pushing the edges of the universe apart.
The abundance of dark energy by itself isn’t so much a problem; the real 
problem is that the dark energy is a lot weaker than physicists would 
expect from purely theoretical calculations based on quantum field theory. 
According to those calculations, the random energy of empty space (the 
“vacuum energy”) should explode up to huge quantities, but instead it 
maintains an incredibly small value.
A theory of everything would hopefully explain why the vacuum energy 
contains the value it does.

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Time Symmetry: Why Does Time 
Seem to Move Forward?
The space dimensions are interchangeable, but time is distinct because it 
seems to move in only one direction. This doesn’t have to be the case. In fact, 
the mathematical laws of physics work either way, even in a universe where 
time could run backwards.
But time doesn’t run backwards at all, and a theory of everything would need 
to explain this discrepancy between the mathematical symmetry of time and 
the physical asymmetry of time that you observe every time you’re running 
late for a meeting.
The End of the Universe: 
What Comes Next?
And, of course, the eternal question of the fate of the universe is another 
question that a theory of everything would need to answer. (Cue up the song 
“It’s the End of the World as We Know It” by R.E.M.) Will our universe (and 
all the others) end in ice, expanding until heat dissipates out across the 
vastness of space? Will galaxies huddle together in dense clusters, like winter 
campers around a campfire? Will the universe contract together and perhaps 
eventually start the cycle of universal creation all over?
Chances are that these questions will be answered long after we’re gone, but 
there is hope that the beginnings of those answers may come within the 
next few years, as some aspects of string theory begin to enter the realm of 
experimental verification.

o new theory can develop without dedicated scientists working hard 
to refine and interpret it. Throughout this book, you read about some 
of the pioneering work in string theory. Now it’s time to find out more about 
some of the scientists themselves, the people who make string theory tick as 
they research the mysteries of the universe within the context of this budding 
science. As string theory unfolds, some of these individuals may become 
legends on the order of Einstein and Newton, or they may end up finding 
useful ways of presenting this complex theory in ways that the general public 
can understand.
In this chapter, I introduce ten physicists who are responsible for the rise 
of string theory. I give brief biographies of not only the founders of string 
theory, but also some of the visionaries who have refined the theory over the 
years. Some of these personalities are also physicists who have written 
popular books or been involved with educational programs on the topic, 
helping to broaden the general public’s understanding of string theory. 
However, this chapter isn’t a “top ten” list, and just because a name hasn’t 
been included should not be taken to mean that the person’s work and 
contributions are any less significant than the names listed.
Edward Witten
Seen by many as the leading thinker of string theory, Witten introduced the 
concept of M-theory in 1995 as a way to consolidate the existing string 
theories into one comprehensive theory. Witten’s work in string theory 
also included the 1984 application of Calabi-Yau manifolds to explain the 
compactification of the extra dimensions.

346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
In 1951, Witten was born into physics, in a sense; his father, Louis Witten, 
was a theoretical physicist specializing in general relativity. Growing up, 
Witten displayed a natural aptitude for mathematics. Despite this, he focused 
his early years on studying history and being politically active, helping with 
George McGovern’s 1972 presidential campaign. His undergraduate degree 
from Brandeis University was in history with a minor in linguistics.
In the fall of 1973, Witten went to graduate school in applied mathematics 
at Princeton University. Despite lacking a physics undergraduate degree, he 
quickly showed himself to be proficient at the complex mathematics involved 
in theoretical physics. He switched to the physics department and received 
his PhD from Princeton in 1976.
Witten has since published more than 300 research papers. According to 
some sources, he has the largest h-index (most often cited papers) of any 
living physicist. He received the MacArthur Foundation “genius grant” 
fellowship in 1982. In 1990, he was the first (and so far only) physicist to 
receive the Fields Medal, sometimes informally called the “Nobel Prize of 
mathematics” (the Nobel Committee awards no mathematics prize). He was 
one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2004.
Among string theorists, Edward Witten is seen as a guiding light because 
of his ability to grasp the implications of the complex mathematics of the 
theory on a level that few others have been able to match. Even the strongest 
string theory critics speak of his intellect and mathematical prowess in awe, 
making clear that he is an unparalleled mind of his generation.
John Henry Schwarz
If string theory were a religion, then John Henry Schwarz would be the 
equivalent of St. Paul. At a time when virtually every other physicist 
abandoned string theory, Schwarz persevered for almost a decade as one of 
the few who tried to work out the theory’s mathematical details, even though 
it hurt his career. Eventually, his work led to the first superstring revolution.
Schwarz was one of the physicists who discovered that supersymmetry 
resolved several of the problems with string theory. Later, Schwarz proposed 
the idea that the spin-2 particle described by string theory may be the 
graviton, meaning that string theory could be the long-sought theory to unify 
quantum physics and general relativity. (See Chapter 10 for more on these 
concepts.)

347
 Chapter 21: Ten Notable String Theorists
Schwarz worked at Caltech for 12 years — from 1972 to 1984 — as a temporary 
researcher instead of a full professor. His career prospects were hindered in 
large part because of his perceived obsession with string theory.
In 1984, Schwarz performed (along with Michael Green) the work showing 
that string theory was consistent, triggering the first superstring revolution. 
Without Schwarz’s decade of dedicated work (or obsession), there would 
have been no foundation in place for superstring theory to build upon 
throughout the 1980s, when it rose to prominence among particle physicists.
Yoichiro Nambu
Yoichiro Nambu is one of the founders of string theory who independently 
discovered the physical description of the Veneziano model as vibrating 
strings. Nambu was already a respected particle physicist for his earlier work 
in describing the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle 
physics. Dr. Nambu received the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.
Though this makes him the only founder of string theory to have received a 
Nobel Prize, it’s important to note that the Nobel award makes no mention 
of string theory. In fact, the Nobel can’t be awarded for theoretical work that 
hasn’t been confirmed or proved useful experimentally.
Leonard Susskind
Leonard Susskind is another founder of string theory. As he recounts in 
his book The Cosmic Landscape: String Theory and the Illusion of Intelligent 
Design, he saw the original dual resonance model equations and thought they 
looked similar to equations for oscillators, which led him to create the string 
description — concurrently with Yoichiro Nambu and Holger Nielson. In 
addition, he has proposed several concepts discussed throughout this 
book: string theory of black hole entropy (Chapter 14), the holographic 
principle (Chapter 11), matrix theory (Chapter 11), and the application of the 
anthropic principle to the string theory landscape (which is the subject of 
The Cosmic Landscape; I cover this principle in Chapter 11).
In addition to his extensive work in string theory, Susskind is well-known for 
his disagreements with Stephen Hawking over the final fate of information that 
falls into a black hole, as outlined in his 2008 book The Black Hole War: My 
Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
David Gross
David Gross was one of the physicists who developed the heterotic string 
theory, one of the major findings of the first superstring revolution.
In 2004, Gross earned (along with colleagues Frank Wilczek and David 
Politzer) the Nobel Prize in Physics for their 1973 discovery of asymptotic 
freedom in the strong nuclear interaction of quarks. (This means that the 
strong interaction between quarks gets weaker at extremely short distances.)
Since 1997, Dr. Gross has been the director of the Kavli Institute for 
Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In this 
capacity, Gross is known not only as a strong advocate for string theory but 
also as a strong opponent of the anthropic principle as applied to the string 
theory landscape.
Joe Polchinski
Joe Polchinski proved that string theory required objects of more than one 
dimension, called branes. Although the concept of branes had previously 
been introduced, Polchinski explored the nature of D-branes. This work was 
crucial to the second superstring revolution of 1995. Polchinski’s work is 
seen as fundamental to the development of M-theory, brane world scenarios, 
and the holographic principle (all covered in Chapter 11).
Lately, Polchinski has become a convert to the anthropic principle’s 
usefulness in string theory, though stories abound of how he once loathed 
the principle, considering it unscientific and threatening to quit his position 
if he were forced to adopt it.
Juan Maldacena
Juan Maldacena is an Argentine physicist who developed the idea that a 
duality exists between string theory and a quantum field theory — called the 
Malcadena duality (or the AdS/CFT correspondence; see Chapter 11).
The Maldacena duality, proposed in 1997, has been applied only in certain 
cases, but if it can be extended to all of string theory, it would allow a means 
to give a precise quantum string theory. In other words, string theorists 

349
 Chapter 21: Ten Notable String Theorists
should be able to translate known principles of gauge field theory into string 
theory equations — an excellent starting point for a complete quantum 
theory of gravity. Also, applying the duality in the other direction, starting 
with string theory and creating predictions about how gauge theory should 
behave could yield predictions that are testable at the Relativistic Heavy Ion 
Collider or Large Hadron Collider in years to come.
Lisa Randall
Theoretical physics is a realm stereotypically dominated by men and, even 
among the rare women who choose it, Lisa Randall doesn’t fit the mold. 
She spends her free time on intense rock climbing expeditions but spends 
her professional days exploring the implications of multidimensional brane 
worlds as a phenomenologist.
Dr. Randall was the first tenured woman in the physics department at 
Princeton University. She was also the first tenured female theoretical 
physicist at MIT and later at Harvard, where she has been since 2001.
Randall rose to prominence among nonphysicists with her 2005 book Warped 
Passages: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Universe’s Hidden Dimensions. 
Among other things, this resulted in her appearance on Comedy Central’s 
wildly popular mock political pundit show, The Colbert Report.
Given her success as a woman in a male-dominated field, it’s not surprising 
that she has impressive credentials. One of the most intriguing models to 
come out of her analysis of brane world scenarios are the Randall-Sundrum 
models, which explore the possibility of gravity behaving differently off of 
our own 3-brane.
Michio Kaku
Physicist Michio Kaku has been one of the most vocal supporters of string 
theory. He worked on the theory early in the 1970s, actually co-founding 
“string field theory” by writing string theory in a field form. By his own 
account, he then abandoned work on string theory because he didn’t believe 
in the additional dimensions the theory demanded. He returned to string 
theory during the first superstring revolution and has proven an entertaining 
and lucid spokesman ever since.

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Dr. Kaku wrote one of the first popular books on the topic, Hyperspace: 
A Scientific Odyssey Through Parallel Universes, Time Warps, and the 10th 
Dimension, in 1994. (This was my first introduction to string theory, when I 
read the book as a high school senior.) He has since written other books on 
futurism and advanced scientific and technology principles. His 2005 book, 
Parallel Worlds, focuses on many topics related to string theory.
For more than 25 years, Kaku has been a professor of theoretical physics at 
the City College of New York. The close proximity to major television networks 
may explain why he regularly appears on so many television programs. With 
a distinctive mane of white hair, Dr. Kaku is easily recognizable when he 
makes appearances on CNN, Discovery, the Science Channel, or ABC’s Good 
Morning, America. (When GMA needed someone to explain how Mentos cause 
soda bottles to erupt into fountains of fizz, they called in Dr. Kaku.)
Kaku has also hosted a number of programs, including two of his own radio 
shows. He is currently seen hosting the SciQ Sunday specials on the Science 
Channel. His research work on the subject of string theory isn’t as impressive 
as the others on this list, but he has done an incredible amount to popularize 
the ideas of string theory. Many recognize him as one of the theory’s most 
vocal proponents to layman audiences.
Brian Greene
Last but certainly not least is probably one of the best-known string theorists, 
especially among nonphysicists. Brian Greene’s popularity as a writer and 
spokesman for the field dates back to his 1999 book The Elegant Universe: 
Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory, which 
was used in 2003 as the basis for a three-part PBS Nova special. In 2004, 
Greene followed up with the book The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, 
and the Fabric of Reality. (He has appeared on Comedy Central’s The Colbert 
Report at least twice, outdoing Dr. Randall’s one appearance.)
Dr. Greene earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard. As a Rhodes 
Scholar, he received a 1986 doctorate from Oxford University. He was a 
professor at Cornell University for several years, but has been a full professor 
at Columbia University since 1996. Throughout his career, his research has 
focused on quantum geometry and attempting to understand the physical 
meaning of the extra dimensions implied by string theory.
In addition to trying to explain string theory to the masses, Greene has been 
co-director of Columbia University’s Institute for Strings, Cosmology and 
Astroparticle Physics (ISCAP) since its founding in 2000.
In 2008, Greene was a founder of the World Science Festival in New York City, 
where a dance troupe performed an interpretative dance version of his book 
The Elegant Universe.

Your plain-English guide to this 
complex scientific theory
String theory is one of the most complicated sciences 
being explored today. Not to worry though! This 
informative guide clearly explains the basics of this hot 
topic, discusses the theory’s hypotheses and predictions, 
and explores its curious implications. It also presents the 
critical viewpoints in opposition to string theory so you can 
draw your own conclusions. 
•  Understand the “theory of everything” — grasp the key concepts 
and importance of the theory, and learn why scientists are so 
excited about finding a theory of quantum gravity
•  It all comes down to physics — discover how string theory is built 
upon the major scientific developments of the early 20th century
•  Building the theory — trace the creation and development of 
string theory, discover its predictions, and see whether accurate 
conclusions can be made 
•  Take string theory for a spin — explore the core issue of extra 
dimensions, the implications for cosmology, and how string 
theory could explain certain properties of our universe
•  Boldly go where no one has gone — see what string theory has to 
say about possible parallel universes, the origin and fate of our 
universe, and the potential for time travel
•  Hear from the critics — listen in on the heated debates about 
string theory and weigh the alternatives being offered
