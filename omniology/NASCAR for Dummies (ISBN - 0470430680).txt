About the Authors
Mark Martin has been racing nearly all his life. Martin began his profes-
sional racing career in the 1970s in the American Speed Association, where 
he was a four-time ASA champion. He successfully made the transition into 
the NASCAR scene in 1981 and has taken the sport by storm. Since 1988, 
he has won 35 races, fourth among active NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers. He 
is considered by many to be the greatest active NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
driver without a championship. Martin’s runner-up fi nish in 2002 marked 
the fourth time he has fi nished second in the fi nal NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
point standings. Martin has fi nished in the top 10 in 16 of his last 18 full-time 
seasons. In 2007 and 2008, he ran a part-time schedule on the NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series. Martin rejoined the series full-time in 2009, driving the No. 5 
Kellogg’s CARQUEST Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports. Martin also has a 
record four International Race of Champions (IROC) titles to his credit and is 
the winningest driver in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, with 48 wins. He also 
helped build a quarter-midget track in New Smyrna, Florida to help up-and-
coming drivers.
He lives in Florida with his wife, Arlene, and son, Matt.
Beth Tuschak is a freelance writer associated with NASCAR and was invalu-
able in updating the second edition of NASCAR For Dummies. She writes free-
lance stories from her home in Concord, North Carolina.
Mike Forde has been the Manager of Statistical Writing for NASCAR since 
2007. Prior to joining NASCAR, Forde covered NASCAR for the New York Post. 
He lives in Lake Mary, Florida.


About NASCAR
The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), organized 
in 1947 by Bill France, Sr., is America’s premier motorsports and entertain-
ment sanctioning body. NASCAR is guided by the third generation of the 
France family. Brian Z. France took the helm as Chairman of the Board and 
CEO in October 2003. Mr. France’s father, Bill France, Jr., led NASCAR during 
a period of astounding growth since January 1972. Bill Jr., as he was known, 
passed away in June of 2007. NASCAR’s best-known and most popular series 
is the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Sprint/NEXTEL became the series’ primary 
sponsor in 2004. Other top national series include the NASCAR Nationwide 
Series and the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. These marquee divi-
sions are well-known to the millions of fans who attend these events and to 
the millions more who watch them on television. NASCAR also sanctions 
seven other regional touring series.
Since 2004, the NASCAR Sprint Cup season features the Chase for the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup. In this format, the top 12 drivers in points after the 26th 
race are assigned new point standings and compete for the championship in 
the last ten races of the season.
NASCAR has become a recognized leader in the entertainment industry, with 
www.NASCAR.com, NASCAR Café restaurants, NASCAR Speed Parks, and 
NASCAR Silicon Motor Speedway.

Introduction
M
ost of the time, people group NASCAR racing into one of two catego-
ries: It’s a sport that’s too simple because the cars just go around in 
circles; or it’s a sport that’s too technical because it’s centered on engines, 
aerodynamics, and the physics of going fast. This book shows you that 
NASCAR racing is really both of these things: It’s simple in some ways but 
complicated in others. That’s what makes it so fun.
At first the simplicity draws you in. You find that out when you go to a race — 
even if you close your eyes. When you sit in the grandstands, you can hear 
the cars roar by. You can feel the tremendous power of the engines when the 
stands shake, your seat vibrates, and your guts rumble. Then you can smell 
the distinct odor of burned rubber that hovers above the race track. NASCAR 
racing is a total body experience; you don’t even have to see the cars — 
much less understand the inner workings of race cars — to get a thrill from 
racing.
If that’s true, though, why read this book? Even though sitting in the stands 
with your eyes closed is entertaining, sitting there with an insider’s view of 
the sport, including the technical side, enriches your experience so much 
more. You know what’s going on when NASCAR officials give a driver a 
15-second penalty. You won’t be lost when the cars line up single file for a 
restart — and you’ll know what a restart is! And a day later, you’ll be able 
to hang out at the water cooler and talk to your coworkers with author-
ity about the race. My job is to share with you all that a fan needs to know 
about NASCAR racing. That way, you can enjoy the sport as much as I do.
About This Book
I learned how to drive when I was just 5 years old, even before I could reach 
the pedals of a car. My dad propped me up in his lap, gave me the wheel, 
and then smashed his foot on the gas. From then on, I was hooked. I started 
to drive a race car at 15, even before I had a driver’s license, and I woke up 
thinking about racing and went to sleep dreaming about racing. In my spare 
time, I worked on and raced cars. It’s no wonder the sport is such a big part 
of my life.

NASCAR For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Sometimes, though, it’s difficult to explain why NASCAR racing is so addic-
tive, particularly to people who’ve never driven a race car and competed 
bumper-to-bumper at breakneck speeds. It’s not like basketball, baseball, 
football, or other sports you play during recess in grade school.
I decided that the best way to explain my love for NASCAR racing wasn’t 
by sticking fans in a race car and making them drive laps around Daytona 
International Speedway. It was by writing this book. If you can’t discover the 
beauty of this sport by doing — and riding down the highway going 80 mph in 
your Honda Accord doesn’t count — you may as well discover it by reading.
If you’re a novice to NASCAR, I help you with the basics of the sport — such 
as the differences between the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and the NASCAR 
Nationwide Series — so you can build upon your NASCAR knowledge from 
there. If you’re more advanced, I share the subtleties of the sport so that you 
can sound like an old pro. No matter what level of NASCAR knowledge you 
have, you can find something new in the pages of this book. I believe it’s the 
most comprehensive book available: I talk about NASCAR’s origin, sponsors, 
engines, race teams, race strategies, pit stops, race tracks, and all you need 
to know if you want to be the quintessential NASCAR fan — and that’s just 
the beginning. My goal is for you to understand everything you see when you 
watch a race and be able to converse and debate intelligently with the most 
ardent, well-informed NASCAR fans.
I hope that, in reading this book, you’ll understand why NASCAR racing is my 
passion. Maybe it’ll become your passion, too.
Foolish Assumptions
Even though this is a For Dummies book, I don’t assume that you’re a fool. 
You’re just trying to find out more about NASCAR racing so that you can 
enjoy the sport, as millions of people already do. Maybe you’re a sports fan 
who’s curious about racing. Maybe you’re an avid race fan who wants to 
brush up on a few things. Maybe you’re my mom who wants to read my book 
to boost my ego.
Maybe you just want the answers to some of these questions:
 
✓ Why does some guy stand above the track and wave all those flags? Is he 
telling the drivers something, or is he part of an off-beat, rhythmic gym-
nastics team?
 
✓ What is a restrictor-plate track, and what’s being restricted?
 
✓ Does it really matter where a driver qualifies for a race?

 Introduction
 
✓ Why do drivers have short tempers at short tracks?
 
✓ Are drivers athletes?
 
✓ Why are tires such a big deal during a race?
 
✓ Why doesn’t a regular Chevrolet Impala at a local dealership look like 
the one Jeff Gordon drives?
 
✓ Who are the sponsors, and why do race teams need them?
In this book, I answer these questions and more.
How This Book Is Organized
This book isn’t just a few hundred pages of statistics and scintillating com-
mentary. It’s broken into six parts to be user-friendly. Each part deals with a 
major aspect of NASCAR racing, and the parts are organized so you can find 
out more about the sport in a simple, painless manner. Each chapter within 
the part dissects a specific detail of the sport — such as qualifying, the race 
tracks, or different NASCAR series. Feel free to skip to the parts and chapters 
that interest you most.
Part I: NASCAR 101
If you’ve never seen NASCAR racing or have only glanced at a race once 
or twice while flipping through the channels on your TV, you’re probably 
wondering what all the hubbub is about. Why is NASCAR one of the nation’s 
most popular sports? What is the allure? Why do I see the drivers on differ-
ent cereal boxes or soda bottles every time I go to the supermarket? Is there 
a NASCAR invasion no one told me about? In this part, I reveal the mystery 
behind the boom of NASCAR racing.
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing?
I drive a Chevrolet Impala and make it go 180 mph at some race tracks. I’m 
sure a few NASCAR fans wonder why their Impalas can’t do the same thing. In 
this part, I tell you not only why your Impala can’t go that fast — besides the 
fact that the speed limits don’t allow it — but also why yours has four doors 
while my Impala doesn’t have any. This is perhaps the most technical part of 
the book, detailing the race cars, the race teams, and many of the rules. It gets 
down to the nitty-gritty, which can help even the most avid NASCAR fan feel 
just a little more like a pro when tuning into a race or going to the race track.

NASCAR For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Part III: What Happens on (and off) 
the Track
Sometimes NASCAR drivers do strange things. They come in for pit stops 
and opt for just a splash-and-go. They draft behind other drivers on super-
speedways with carburetor restrictor plates in their engines. They wear 
funny shoes. In this part, I decipher and explain racing itself, staying safe, and 
winning an event. No longer will you be perplexed when a driver talks about 
racing for championship points or doing the hat dance. The chapters in this 
part help you follow every word of racing jargon — and there’s plenty of that 
to go around. NASCAR racing is its own world, and in this part, I invite you in 
and teach you about the native customs.
Part IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events
There’s nothing worse than showing up at a NASCAR race in a hoop skirt and 
a bonnet. In this part, I tell you how to fit in at the race track by dressing like 
a NASCAR fan, talking like a NASCAR fan, watching a race like a NASCAR fan, 
and following NASCAR like a NASCAR fan.
Part V: The Part of Tens
If you don’t have time to get drawn in by an entire chapter, The Part of Tens 
is perfect for you. In this part, you can find little morsels of information pack-
aged into neat, manageable (and short) chapters about NASCAR’s all-time 
greatest drivers, the best NASCAR races, and the closest finishes in NASCAR 
history.
Part VI: Appendixes
In NASCAR racing, people talk in NASCAR language — which isn’t at all similar 
to the conversational French or obsolete Latin you studied in high school. It’s 
a unique language used in racing circles, and you can find a big chunk of it in 
Appendix A. They’re all the racing terms you need to know.
The other appendixes list NASCAR statistics, race car numbers, and key 
NASCAR milestones — good stuff to know if you’re planning to be a contes-
tant on Jeopardy! sometime soon.

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
To make things easier, I use icons — little pictures in the margins — to high-
light important information: giving you advice, a warning, or knowledge in 
order to impress friends at dinner parties.
 
This icon points out information that helps you save time, money, and effort.
 
If you know these words, you won’t seem like an accountant among a group of 
rock stars when you’re in a conversation with die-hard NASCAR fans.
 
Take heed when you see this caution flag. Its goal is to save you from losing 
money, getting hurt, or exposing yourself to other dangers.
S
 
When you see one of these icons, you’ll know you’re about to read a story 
from my years of NASCAR racing experience.
 
This information is for the real geeky fans who want to know all the details, 
no matter how complex. Non-geeks can skip these icons.
Where to Go from Here
You know when you’re reading a great book and you’re dying to get to the 
last chapter because you can’t stand the suspense? Well, in this book you 
can. It won’t ruin the story for you — because there is no story. There isn’t 
a beginning, middle, or end, so just flip to the last chapter and read it first if 
you want. Go ahead. Your high school English teacher isn’t looking. Actually, 
you can turn to any chapter and read it. There’s nothing to be ashamed of 
because that’s the way I’ve designed the book. Every chapter is written to 
stand alone and provide information about NASCAR’s nuances. The Table 
of Contents and the Index list what’s in this potpourri of NASCAR racing, 
so choose where you want to begin your journey — then have fun!

ASCAR racing is everywhere nowadays: Races are 
on TV, race tracks are in nearly every part of the 
country, and drivers have their pictures on cereal boxes 
and billboards. If you’re new to NASCAR, you may be 
perplexed by this invasion, so in this part I reveal the 
mysteries of NASCAR racing and tell you why so many 
fans are flocking to the sport. I also answer all your ques-
tions about corporate involvement in the sport and why 
at times it seems as if NASCAR is one big, uninterrupted 
commercial for motor oil, beer, and laundry detergent.
I also describe each NASCAR series so that you can tell 
the difference between the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, the 
NASCAR Nationwide Series, and the NASCAR Camping 
World Truck Series. You also find out about NASCAR’s 
grassroots divisions, which are considered the lifeblood 
of NASCAR racing.
If your dream is to be more than just a fan of the sport, I 
can help you out in that department, too. This part gives 
you a few hints on how to become a race car driver or get 
a job on a NASCAR crew.

ost people don’t know what it’s like to dunk a basketball or hit a 
 100-mph fastball 500 feet for a home run, but almost everyone knows 
how to drive a car. That familiarity is one of the appeals of NASCAR and 
stock-car racing. Whether they admit it or not, lots of people speed down the 
highway and daydream about winning the Daytona 500. That daydreamer 
could be a 17-year-old high school student who just got a driver’s license, a 
35-year-old orthodontist, or a 70-year-old retired teacher. Driving is nearly 
universal.
NASCAR’s allure has grown in recent years because of its tremendous televi-
sion exposure; the drivers’ accessibility to their fans; and close, competitive 
racing. In 2007, nearly 5 million fans went to see the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
races, which is quadruple the attendance in 1980. And more than 250 million 
viewers tuned in to NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events on television in 2007, 
making NASCAR one of the most popular sports to watch on TV, second only 
to the NFL.
NASCAR has grown from an originally Southern-based sport to a truly 
national phenomenon. In addition to the sheer numbers of viewers, it’s the 
number-one sport in terms of fan brand loyalty, and it generates more than 
$2 billion in licensed sales.

Part I: NASCAR 101 
If you’re one of the sport’s new fans, this chapter gives you NASCAR in a nut-
shell, including enough details about its history, cars, drivers, teams, races, 
and statistics to make you sound like a veteran. If you’re an old hand, you can 
brush up on what’s new, as the sport is constantly evolving.
Moving from Back Roads to the Big Time
Decades ago, stock-car races weren’t the professionally run events that they 
are now, even though many organizations — including the United Stock Car 
Racing Association, the Stock Car Auto Racing Society, and the National 
Championship Stock Car Circuit — sanctioned races. The schedule wasn’t 
organized; instead, random races were held here and there, sprinkled through-
out the southeastern United States wherever tracks were available. (Some 
tracks were well-built, but most were pretty shoddy.) Drivers didn’t race in 
each event, so fans had no idea which of their favorites would show up until 
they got to the track. Worse, some race promoters were less than honest, run-
ning off with the ticket receipts and race purses, never to be seen again.
The first NASCAR race
In February 1948, two months after NASCAR 
was founded, more than 14,000 people showed 
up at a race course just south of Daytona Beach. 
The 150-mile event was held on a unique track 
that was half on the beach and half on the high-
way behind the sand, making it interesting for 
drivers and spectators alike, particularly when 
the tide came in and the beach narrowed. Red 
Byron, a driver from Anniston, Alabama, whose 
left leg was injured when his bomber was shot 
down in World War II, won that first NASCAR-
sanctioned race, cementing his reputation as 
one of NASCAR’s greatest early drivers. It also 
made him the answer to a common NASCAR 
trivia question: “Who won the first NASCAR 
race?”
Red Byron also won NASCAR’s first Strictly 
Stock championship. This series — which 
is now known as the NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series — debuted in 1949 and was limited to 
full-sized American production, or “stock,” 
cars. The first Strictly Stock race was held in 
June 1949. Anyone with a car was eligible to 
race, and I mean anyone — people who had 
never raced before made the trip to the .75-mile 
dirt track in Charlotte, North Carolina, to see 
how they could do. All they needed was a car 
and a fair amount of guts. Kansas native Jim 
Roper won that debut race.
The cars were plain vehicles like Buicks, Fords, 
and Lincolns, not like today’s race cars, which 
are built from the ground up by multi-million-
dollar teams and tuned specifically for racing. 
If drivers wanted to race back then, they could 
drive the family car right onto the track! Of 
course, if a driver crashed and destroyed his 
car, he could be stranded. Hitchhiking home 
was not out of the realm of possibility.

11
 Chapter 1: NASCAR Racing: The Best Sport Around
 
Bill France, Sr., a tall, dynamic stock-car driver and race promoter, thought 
this was an unprofessional way to run a sport and was determined to set a 
standard for drivers and track owners. He decided to devote his energy to 
establishing one preeminent stock-car racing sanctioning body — NASCAR 
(National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing) — that would oversee differ-
ent series. A racing series, such as the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, is similar to 
a baseball league, featuring a group of drivers who compete in a set number of 
events and follow rules determined by the sanctioning body. At the end of the 
season, the sanctioning body (which runs the events and makes sure competi-
tors follow the rules) crowns a series champion. That’s exactly what France, 
also known as “Big Bill,” created with his brainchild — NASCAR. In the begin-
ning, France had several goals:
 
✓ Race tracks that were safe for the drivers, and track owners who 
repaired their facilities between races: If a car crashed into or through 
a guard rail, it would have to be repaired by the track owner before the 
next race.
 
✓ Rules that wouldn’t change from week to week or race to race: Before 
NASCAR was organized, different tracks had different rules, which 
drove drivers to distraction. Some even had quirky on-track rules, made 
up the morning of a race by a promoter seeking to make things more 
exciting. Because of these inconsistencies, drivers didn’t know what 
to expect when they showed up at a race track. These days, rules still 
occasionally change but are often studied for a period of months before 
being implemented.
 
✓ A set schedule allowing the same drivers to compete against one 
another each week: This way, a single national champion recognized by 
all could be crowned at the end of the year.
 
✓ A uniform point system to calculate which driver performed the best 
throughout the season: Drivers would earn points according to how they 
finished in a race, with the winner receiving the most points and the last-
place driver getting the least. With a points system like that, the series 
could crown a definitive champion instead of having many “national cham-
pions” crowned at different tracks or in different, smaller series. Having just 
one national champion made winning the title something special.
 
✓ An insurance and benevolent fund: This was meant to give the drivers 
something to fall back on in case they got hurt or couldn’t compete due 
to injuries.
France’s goals were realized, and today NASCAR sanctions several racing 
series. The top one is the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, and I spend most of the 
book talking about this series. I give you a quick rundown on the NASCAR 
Nationwide Series, the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, and several 
NASCAR touring series in Chapter 3.

Part I: NASCAR 101 
Defining Stock-Car Racing
When different people think of auto racing, the same image of a race car 
doesn’t necessarily pop into their heads. That’s because many different types 
of race cars and hundreds of racing series, or racing leagues, exist through-
out the world.
NASCAR stock cars are unique in that they look more like what a suburbanite 
drives than any other type of race car. But looks can be deceiving. Almost 
nothing is “stock” when it comes to NASCAR vehicles, whether they run in 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, or NASCAR Camping 
World Truck Series events. In addition to bodies (or chassis) reinforced with 
roll bars, multi-part driver restraint systems, and roof flaps that stop the car 
from flipping over, NASCAR vehicles are among the fastest — and safest — 
on earth.
Four brands of cars compete in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series: the Chevrolet 
Impala, the Ford Fusion, the Dodge Charger, and the Toyota Camry. The 
manufacturers of these brands of cars see the sport as a great marketing 
tool; hence the saying “Win on Sunday, sell on Monday.” In fact, studies have 
shown that NASCAR fans are 50 percent more likely to buy their favorite driv-
er’s car make than to buy from a manufacturer not involved in NASCAR.
Here’s a quick rundown on the other types of racing vehicles (Figure 1-1 
shows you some of the differences):
 
✓ Open-wheel cars: The cars that run in the Indianapolis 500 are open-
wheel cars. They’re agile, lightweight racing cars with an open cockpit. 
Open-wheel cars also have no fenders, so they can’t bump and bang 
as stock cars do or they would crash — or at least severely hurt their 
chances of winning. Two different leagues that use open-wheel cars are
 
• Formula One: The world’s best-known open-wheel series
 
• IndyCar Series: Which competes on both oval and road course 
tracks and features the Indy 500 on its yearly schedule
 
✓ Dragsters: These are speedsters that race a short distance in a short 
period of time. They race in pairs on a straight, flat, quarter-mile strip of 
asphalt or concrete. The fastest ones can go from 0 to 100 mph in less 
than 1 second, topping out at speeds in excess of 320 mph. The premier 
dragsters are called Top Fuel cars, which are specialized cars that look 
more like rocket ships than anything else. They have long, tapered noses 
with two small front tires. The driver sits in a partially enclosed cockpit 

13
 Chapter 1: NASCAR Racing: The Best Sport Around
about 10 feet behind the wheels, with the engine behind him or her. 
Other dragsters are a little less exotic: Funny Cars are highly modified, 
jazzed-up stock cars, while Street Stock cars look like passenger cars.
 
✓ Sports cars: Most are production (sports) cars with highly special-
ized engines, but the fastest are open-cockpit cars that sit close to the 
ground (like Ferraris). The cars are prototypes, which means they are 
built specifically for racing and aren’t sold to the public. The most popu-
lar form of sports car racing in the United States is the Grand-Am Series.

Meeting the Racing Team
One of the best aspects of NASCAR is that its drivers are regular people — 
that is, until they get to the race track. As is the case with all competitive 
athletes, NASCAR drivers have their own personalities, which are often mag-
nified when they get behind the wheel. The legendary Richard Petty, whose 
200-victory record will probably never be topped (he raced up to 60 times a 
season), is one of the nicest guys in the garage area, always stopping to sign 
autographs while flashing his signature smile. But Petty didn’t win seven 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championships by being the series’ sweetheart 
during a race; he bumped and banged with the best of them.
Drivers like Tony Stewart and Matt Kenseth prefer their on-track perfor-
mance to talking, while the colorful Carl Edwards is always quick with a 
sharp smile and an insightful quote. These days, the prototypical driver more 
closely resembles multiple NASCAR Sprint Cup champions Jeff Gordon and 
Jimmie Johnson, who keep their tempers to themselves and remain com-
posed in virtually any situation. After all, losing your cool usually doesn’t 
translate to checkered flags.
During a time when many athletes are out of touch with the fans who pay 
their bills, NASCAR drivers are seen by many of their supporters as the guys 
next door. And they are definitely the most accessible of highly hyped ath-
letes. Although some are naturally friendlier and others are more reserved, 
many retain an innate humbleness, which comes from remembering the early 
days of their careers when they built and worked on their own cars — and a 
wrecked car meant a wrecked career. They also recognize that without fans, 
NASCAR wouldn’t exist. Even though drivers are pulled in many directions, 
from testing their vehicles to making appearances on behalf of their spon-
sors, they remain fairly accessible. NASCAR drivers still sign autographs and 
make appearances at malls in the cities in which they race. (For more infor-
mation on drivers’ schedules and their fan clubs, see Chapter 16.)
NASCAR drivers are also known as family men who bring their wives and chil-
dren to many races — thanks to modern, comfortable motor homes replacing 
the need to stay in hotels. Many attend church services on the morning of a 
race and are very aware that they are role models to kids and teens watch-
ing their every move. When people talk about the NASCAR family, they don’t 
mean just the competitors. NASCAR fans tend to “adopt” a certain driver to 
root for, and he becomes a member of their extended family.
Although NASCAR’s drivers are front and center when it comes to recogni-
tion and attention, they wouldn’t be in the racing business were it not for the 
hundreds of people who run the sport; create the teams; work on the crews; 
sponsor cars and races; and bring the action to the nation via television, 
radio, Internet, and newspapers.

 Chapter 1: NASCAR Racing: The Best Sport Around
At the top of any individual race team is the owner, who pays the bills and 
calls the shots. Team owners also spend a vast amount of time searching 
for and pleasing sponsors, who spend millions of dollars for the right to put 
the name of their company across a car’s hood. The team owner gets a great 
deal of help from his general manager and crew chief, who are in charge of 
everything from hiring employees to setting the testing schedule to being 
responsible for a car’s performance on any given Sunday. Teams employ a 
large number of specialists who work at the race shop doing everything from 
painting the driver’s cars to sweeping the floor of the garage.
During the last 15 years, it has become common practice for an owner to field 
more than one team, which is obviously more expensive but gives him or her 
more chances to share information between teams and more opportunities to 
visit Victory Lane. (For more on team ownership, see Chapter 7.)
Using Strategy to Win a Race
 
NASCAR racing is about much more than making rules and driving fast. In fact, 
becoming successful in NASCAR entails much more than the ability to handle 
a race car at high speeds. By the time a race starts, a driver and his crew have 
put in many hours of work building and tweaking the vehicle so that it handles 
How I got started
Growing up in Batesville, Arkansas, I thought 
racing was the greatest thing in the world. My 
dad got me interested in it, and, considering 
racing is for people who love taking risks, it 
was no wonder he liked it so much. My dad was 
the wildest, fastest-running guy around, and he 
wanted me to be the same way.
My dad used to prop me up on his lap while he 
was in the driver’s seat of the car and, without 
taking no for an answer, would make me take 
the steering wheel. Then he’d slam his foot on 
the accelerator and off we’d go. It scared me to 
death, but I was stuck steering that car some-
times at speeds over 80 mph on gravel roads 
around our hometown. The more we drove, the 
more I got used to it — and the more I fell in 
love with the sensation of going fast and taking 
the car to the edge.
I started racing cars when I was 15, even before 
I had a driver’s license. That’s when I discov-
ered that everything about the sport of stock-
car racing thrilled me. I became obsessed with 
the sounds and the speed — but mostly with 
the prospect of becoming a successful driver. 
For me, there was nothing better than driving a 
race car, especially because I was good at it. I 
won my first race in only my second start at a 
local track in Arkansas.
S

Part I: NASCAR 101 
well for that particular track, whether a short track, a road course, or a super-
speedway (any track that is over a mile in length). Once at the track, drivers 
hit the pavement for practice laps, trying to coax the most speed they can out 
of their cars in order to both qualify and race well. A qualifying lap determines 
where a driver will start a race; the one who is fastest over one lap gets to 
start from the front pole position, and the second-fastest driver starts next to 
him on the front row.
When the race starts, the objective is to move to the front if you started in 
the back and to hold onto the lead if you started up front. The most success-
ful drivers are well-schooled in the art of passing the competition, either by 
having that day’s fastest car or by hooking up with a fellow driver in a draft, 
as two or three cars end-to-end can push one another past a car stuck out on 
its own. (For more information on drafting and race strategy, turn to Chapter 
10.) A good pit crew that can change four tires and fill two cans of gas in less 
than 14 seconds is also crucial to having a winning car. The first car off pit 
road, especially near the end of the race, often is the one that makes the hard 
left into Victory Lane.
S
 
Winning has become increasingly difficult as the sport has become more 
popular and more drivers enter races. That makes winning more special than 
it used to be. Don’t get me wrong, it was special when I won my first NASCAR 
Sprint Cup race in 1989, but today, there isn’t as much disparity in equipment 
between first- and last-place teams. This is fine with me because it makes win-
ning more satisfying.
Rules keep the fans happy
Like other professional sports, NASCAR has 
a rule book. Unlike other professional sports, 
however, that rule book changes during the 
season — in the form of what is known as 
“technical bulletins.” For example, if a driver’s 
team gets an edge over everybody else with 
the car’s aerodynamics or in a particular part 
of the engine, NASCAR may change the rule 
regarding that area, and the team’s advantage 
disappears.
While rule changes sometimes appear to help 
or hinder a certain manufacturer, others affect 
drivers equally, such as the introduction in 2004 
of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, which 
opened the title race to the top ten drivers in 
the standings (or those within 400 points of 
the leader) with ten races remaining. In 2007, 
the Chase expanded to the top 12 drivers — 
and only the top 12 drivers. (The rule that had 
allowed drivers within 400 points of the leader 
to also make the Chase was stricken.)
While some rule changes are difficult to swal-
low, they’re done for a specific reason — to 
keep the races exciting for the fans. Without 
great racing, there would be no fans. And with-
out fans, I wouldn’t be living my dream and 
racing for a living. It’s a necessary tradeoff 
between the rules and success. And, unlike 
the rule changes before NASCAR was formed, 
at least we know our changes in advance. We 
also know there’s a reason for the new rules — 
to keep the competition as thrilling and as even 
as possible.

Heading Out to the Track
Watching a NASCAR race is a total-body, all-sensory experience: the earth-
shattering sound of an 850-horsepower engine roaring when a driver flips the 
ignition switch, the sight of 43 colorful cars flying around a track fender-to-
fender as the grandstands shake, and the gritty smell of burned rubber mixed 
with gasoline. If watching races on television from your living room isn’t 
enough of a rush for you, it’s time to head out to the track. Here are several 
great races you may want to check out yourself (see Chapter 15 for more info 
on going to races):
 
✓ The Daytona 500: This is NASCAR’s version of the Super Bowl, which 
is held in February and signals the start of the season. Teams spend 
several weeks at Daytona International Speedway getting ready for the 
year’s most hotly contested event. Even past series champions say 
they don’t consider their résumés complete unless they have won the 
Daytona 500.
 
✓ The Allstate 400 at the Brickyard: NASCAR has had no trouble pack-
ing the Indianapolis Motor Speedway stands (long the hallowed ground 
of the Indy 500 [open-wheel] race) with more than 250,000 spectators 
each July. Jeff Gordon is the event’s master, having won four Brickyard 
events since NASCAR’s inaugural race there in 1994.
 
✓ Talladega Superspeedway events: Both races at NASCAR’s longest track 
(2.66 miles) are hot tickets. Even with the introduction of carburetor 
restrictor plates, which have kept average speeds under 180 mph, fans 
can’t get enough of the high-speed action. (For more on restrictor plates, 
see Chapter 14.) Many races end with last-lap surprises at this Alabama 
track.
 
✓ Bristol Motor Speedway events: This short half-mile track brings out the 
beast in every driver, with close-quarters racing sending many drivers to 
the garage area long before a winner is declared. The bumping and bang-
ing is the bane of many teams, who spend weeks afterward smoothing 
out the dings and dents in the car’s superstructure.
 
✓ Darlington Raceway events: The history bursts out of this place. 
Darlington was the first NASCAR superspeedway, and it’s a fan and 
driver favorite. When driver Carl Edwards was asked to name his favor-
ite track, he didn’t miss a beat: Darlington Raceway was the answer. A 
race car driver hasn’t lived until he’s earned his Darlington stripe — the 
strip on the passenger side door that occurs when a car rubs up against 
one of Darlington’s outside walls.

Reaching the Big Time
Millions of fans dedicate a portion of their weekend to attending or watch-
ing NASCAR events, a far cry from the hundred or so who turned up in 
the sport’s early days to witness the competition on small dirt or asphalt 
tracks. In addition to unparalleled action, NASCAR has grown in leaps and 
bounds thanks to two entities: sponsors and media coverage. Without either, 
NASCAR most likely would still be a regional sport with limited opportunities 
to get a first-hand look at the action.
Depending on the sponsors
It costs tens of millions of dollars to operate a NASCAR team, so team owners 
must get companies to sponsor their racing organizations to ease most of 
the financial burden. These companies use NASCAR as a vehicle (no pun 
intended) for their marketing campaigns, with their logos plastered on the 
cars and the drivers’ uniforms. But it’s a two-way street because NASCAR and 
its drivers also benefit. When NASCAR fans see an advertisement for M&Ms 
they think of Kyle Busch, who is sponsored by that company. The same holds 
Mark Martin fans
It’s hard to believe how many NASCAR fans buy 
racing paraphernalia to support their favorite 
drivers. Then again, as a driver, it’s even harder 
to believe how many fans root for me. I drove 
for a long time before that sunk in, but I’ll never 
forget the moment it did. In 1990, seven long 
years after my first NASCAR Sprint Cup race, 
I was driving at North Wilkesboro Speedway in 
North Carolina, battling Dale Earnhardt for the 
lead. At that point, Earnhardt had won three of 
his seven NASCAR Sprint Cup championships, 
and my goal was to keep him from winning a 
fourth that year and to beat him in that race. It 
wasn’t easy getting by Earnhardt, but when I 
finally passed him, the crowd went wild.
Usually a driver doesn’t see the fans because 
he’s concentrating so much on the race. On 
that day, though, I could see the crowd out of 
the corner of my eye as soon as I began the 
pass. They were standing up, hooting and hol-
lering as I pulled next to Earnhardt. They only 
got louder as we raced side-by-side down the 
frontstretch, which is the straight section of the 
race track between the first and last turns. (See 
Chapter 9 for more details on the layout of race 
tracks.) It created an even bigger stir when I 
passed Earnhardt for good and won the race. 
At that moment, standing in Victory Lane and 
seeing all those fans, I realized that the crowd 
was rooting for me and that I had a pretty big 
following. Even though Earnhardt won the 
championship that year and I was the runner-
up, I still felt pretty good about that moment at 
North Wilkesboro. It was unforgettable.

true for DuPont, which has reaped immeasurable benefits from its associa-
tion with Jeff Gordon. Sponsors are integral in boosting NASCAR’s popular-
ity, and in turn they gain financial rewards. If it weren’t for sponsors, teams 
wouldn’t have the financial wherewithal to travel across the country so fans 
can see them compete in person.
Catching races on the tube
The modern era of NASCAR television broadcasting is considered to have 
begun in 1979. In that year, CBS aired its first live, flag-to-flag telecast of the 
Daytona 500, catapulting the sport into a new age.
Coincidentally, 1979 was also the year that ESPN was born. When ESPN 
began broadcasting in 1979, it needed to fill 24 hours a day with sports. 
Broadcasting racing was an ideal way for the network to fill hours. It was a 
perfect fit — a sports station looking for sports to televise, and a sport look-
ing to be televised much more extensively than it was. TV rights to races 
were less expensive then, costing the networks about $50,000 per event. After 
the two entities came together, some viewers stumbled upon racing, includ-
ing NASCAR, because it was on so often. Existing fans couldn’t get enough to 
begin with, and the more races that ESPN broadcast, the more they watched.
Signing up the major sponsors
In 1970, Robert Glenn Johnson, Jr., a legendary 
driver and car owner, took a trip to Winston-
Salem, North Carolina, and changed the sport 
of stock-car racing forever. Johnson, who goes 
by Junior instead of his given name, went to the 
town to talk to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company 
(RJR) executives and convince them to spon-
sor his race team. The meeting resulted in 
much more than anyone imagined. Instead of 
sponsoring Johnson’s race team, RJR ended up 
sponsoring the entire series.
But things are always changing, and in 2003, 
NASCAR and Nextel announced a ten-year 
series sponsorship beginning in 2004. The wire-
less communications leader wanted to build on 
the opportunities associated with the 55-year-
old sanctioning body, as well as the numerous 
ways Nextel’s technology enhances the sport 
for fans, competitors, officials, media, sponsors, 
and tracks. Nextel’s investment in what was 
then called the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup Series 
went beyond the race track, activating fan 
interactive opportunities as well as community 
and charity initiatives.
In 2005, communications giant Sprint purchased 
Nextel, and starting in 2008, NASCAR’s premier 
series was renamed the NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series. The marketing pact between NASCAR 
and Sprint has proved to be a goldmine of 
opportunity. A Fortune 500 company, Sprint is 
a leading provider of fully-integrated wireless 
communications services and has built the 
largest guaranteed all-digital wireless network 
in the country.

Today, NASCAR can be found almost anywhere on the dial (see Figure 1-2). 
Fox broadcasts the first part of the NASCAR Sprint Cup season, with TNT 
coming in for six races in the middle. The season ends with broadcasts on 
ESPN and ABC. Satellite company DIRECTV broadcasts the entire NASCAR 
Sprint Cup season, with four fully produced driver channels per race. But 
that’s just the NASCAR Sprint Cup. The NASCAR Nationwide Series is broad-
cast entirely on the ESPN family of networks: ESPN, ESPN2, and ABC. SPEED 
shows almost all 25 of the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series races, with 
Fox airing a few races each season. A number of NASCAR’s touring series 
races are broadcast on HDNet, TSN (Canada), and Televisa (Mexico). For 
more on NASCAR’s touring series, see Chapter 3.

But those are only the NASCAR races. NASCAR-themed programming is more 
readily available than ever before. ESPN has a daily NASCAR show — NASCAR 
Now — and SPEED has NASCAR programming on throughout the week.
Where are the women?
As you may guess, stock-car racing started 
out as a male-dominated sport, but change 
has come. Several women drivers and women 
team members have made it into the NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, 
and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. 
Sara Christian owns the distinction of being the 
first woman driver in the NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series. She raced in the series’ very first race 
at Charlotte Speedway, finishing 14th in a field 
of 33 cars. Janet Guthrie raced in the NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series in the mid-1970s and com-
peted in the 1977 Daytona 500, making her the 
only woman to compete in NASCAR’s biggest 
race. She finished 12th. Patty Moise raced sev-
eral seasons in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. 
Shawna Robinson became the only woman to 
win a pole position for a NASCAR Nationwide 
Series race, but she took a hiatus when she had 
difficulty securing a sponsor and then decided to 
have children. More recently, Chrissy Wallace 
(daughter of NASCAR Nationwide Series driver 
Mike Wallace) and Jennifer Jo Cobb have 
competed in a number of NASCAR Camping 
World Truck Series events.
Although the ratio of men to women on the 
track is unbalanced, a race car driver is a race 
car driver. On the track, it’s every man and 
woman for himself or herself. Robinson has said 
that people treat her just as they do the men 
drivers — and she prefers it that way because 
she would rather distinguish herself as a good 
driver than as a good female driver.
Today there are many women in the garage 
area, working as NASCAR officials, journalists, 
and public relations representatives. And while 
the number of women working in the garage 
has grown slowly over the years, the number of 
female fans has exploded. Nearly 40 percent of 
fans who attend races these days are women, 
which is a tremendous gain from 1975 when 
just 15 percent of attendees were women. 
This change is all part of the overall growth of 
NASCAR.

f you think NASCAR is just a bunch of guys driving souped-up race cars, 
you’re mistaken. It takes much more than someone working on his grand-
dad’s old Plymouth — no matter how powerful the engine — to race in 
NASCAR today.
You can see NASCAR’s growth everywhere. While you may expect to find life-
sized cutouts of four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon 
greeting you at a General Motors dealership, nowadays you also bump into 
likenesses of NASCAR drivers in less likely places: in all sorts of TV ads, in toy 
stores, and even in supermarkets.
While NASCAR started as a primarily Southern-based sport, this is no longer 
true. When the media began paying attention to the fierce competition and 
the incredible bonds between drivers and fans, the sport inevitably boomed. 
Today, with impressive race tracks opening across the country, and with 
multi-million-dollar sponsorship packages, licensing deals, and television 
contracts in place, NASCAR is everywhere.
Respecting the Sponsors 
Who Pay the Bills
NASCAR racing is more sponsor-oriented than any other sport in the world. 
Major companies sponsor major races, such as the Subway Fresh Fit 500 and 
the Coca-Cola 600, as well as individual racing teams. You simply can’t ignore 
the race team sponsors. Not only are the cars covered with decals of the 

24
Part 1: NASCAR 101 
companies that sponsor race teams and provide race car parts, but the driv-
ers’ and racing teams’ uniforms are plastered with company names — on the 
chest, on the back, and going down both sleeves and the sides of both legs.
A driver obviously isn’t going to wear a sponsor logo when dressed in a tux, 
but when he’s making official appearances at a car dealership or a mall, he 
wears hats and shirts with his sponsors’ name on them. Hey, it’s a break for 
his clothing budget because sponsors provide all those hundreds of shirts 
and hats free of charge.
Different levels of sponsorship exist — primary and associate — based on 
how much a company pays to the team. But no matter how much or how 
little the companies spend, they all do it for the same reason: Sponsoring a 
race team gives companies a fantastic marketing tool on race day — a rolling 
billboard. Many companies, including those in the Fortune 500, take advan-
tage of that opportunity.
Companies that purchase title sponsorship of races, such as Coca-Cola, 
Sharpie, and Samsung, spend big bucks to have their names listed as primary 
event sponsors. When television announcers mention a race, they include the 
sponsoring company’s name in their reports, such as the Allstate 400 at the 
Brickyard or the Chevy Rock & Roll 400.
Series sponsors: They’re everywhere
Series sponsors go directly to the source — the sanctioning body, NASCAR. 
These companies don’t sponsor the cars; they sponsor the various NASCAR 
series. As of this writing, those companies are Sprint, Nationwide Insurance, 
Camping World, and Whelen.
Because of their association with NASCAR, these companies get most of the 
recognition during a race weekend. They also get the privilege of nabbing the 
coveted “official” title. For instance, as part of the deal to sponsor NASCAR’s 
No. 2 series, Nationwide Insurance also became the official insurance com-
pany of NASCAR.
Primary sponsors: They’re loaded
Primary sponsors are the bigwig companies that pay tens of millions of dollars 
to put their names on the cars’ hoods, which are the best places to advertise 
because fans can see them so well. The first national sponsor to appear in 
NASCAR was the Air Lift Corporation. The company manufactured auto-
motive aftermarket inflatable bags, which were added to a car’s suspension 

25
 Chapter 2: The Big Business of NASCAR
to improve the handling of the vehicle. The product proved successful on 
race cars, so the company looked to NASCAR to advertise. A deal was struck 
with Bobby Griffin, an Oldsmobile dealer from Florence, South Carolina, 
to paint the Air Lift name on the side of his new Olds 88. The Air Lift logo 
became a familiar sight on the side of race cars for the next several decades.
The price tag these days for being a primary sponsor of a NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series team can be as much as $20 million per season. Teams have to secure 
a good primary sponsor because the costs of equipment, travel, and person-
nel are just too expensive for a team owner to absorb by himself. Without a 
constant flow of cash, a team can’t hire the best employees or get the best 
equipment — and in racing today, those factors are keys to winning.
S
 
Kellogg’s/CARQUEST is my current sponsor, but I’ve had other primary spon-
sors in the past, including the U.S. Army, Viagra, Valvoline, Folger’s Coffee, 
Stroh’s Beer, and Amzoil. You can find all sorts of companies involved in 
racing today — companies you’d never expect to be interested in stock-car 
racing at all, such as UPS, Home Depot, Office Depot, M&M’s, and Kodak. Even 
Betty Crocker sponsored a car for a while. The diversity of these sponsors 
shows how much the sport has moved away from the days when oil and gaso-
line companies were the most common types of sponsors.
 
Primary sponsors also often help determine a car’s paint scheme, or the way a 
car is painted and decorated. The paint scheme usually stays much the same 
throughout a season, but sometimes sponsors change that look for certain 
races, perhaps to market a specific brand of their product or unveil something 
new. When a special paint scheme is unveiled, some fans flock to stores to 
seek out souvenirs — many of which will become collectors’ items.
In some instances, the car’s number has sponsor significance. For instance, 
the No. 07 Chevrolet driven by Clint Bowyer is sponsored by Jack Daniel’s, 
which is known as “old No. 7.” Also, Brian Vickers’s No. 83 Toyota is spon-
sored and owned by Red Bull. Red Bull packaging holds 8.3 ounces. One 
more: DLP HDTV sponsors the No. 96 Toyota — 1996 was the first year DLP 
technology was used.
Not only do primary sponsors get the most exposure on uniforms and cars, 
but they also get more of a commitment from the driver in terms of sponsor 
appearances. When a driver makes an appearance, he shows up to sign post-
ers, programs, and trading cards for fans or employees at supermarket grand 
openings, auto shows, conventions, car dealerships, fairgrounds, auto stores, 
and other venues. Sometimes, a sponsor also asks a driver to give a speech 
or host a question-and-answer session for fans or employees. With sponsors’ 
increasing involvement in the sport, public speaking and public relations 
are big parts of a driver’s life. How many appearances a driver is required to 
make depends on the contract he or she signs at the beginning of the season. 
(See Chapter 8 for more information on a driver’s sponsor obligations.)

26
Part 1: NASCAR 101 
 
You’ll have better luck meeting a driver at an appearance than at the race 
track. Most of the time when a race comes to town, drivers make local appear-
ances, so keep an eye on the newspaper for those dates and places. You also 
can find out where the drivers will be during the week by checking with their 
race shops (see Chapter 16 for the addresses).
Associate sponsors: The price is right
 
Companies that can’t afford to spend millions of dollars still get a chance 
to sponsor a race team. Associates pay less money and, in turn, don’t get as 
much exposure on the car or the uniform as the primary sponsors do. But the 
company’s logo is still plastered on the car, usually on the side, and on every 
die-cast collector’s car. Most teams have dozens of associate sponsors, their 
decals creating a colorful mosaic on the side of the car. The associates also 
get to use the driver in TV commercials or print ads and get the driver for a 
few appearances each season.
The levels of associate sponsorship and costs vary depending on the team 
and the size of the company’s decal on the car. In the NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series, associate sponsorships can cost up to $5 million, with sponsorship of 
the higher-profile teams costing more. The highest level of associate sponsor-
ship is major associate, which is the level just below a primary sponsor but 
above a regular associate. Sometimes, it’s almost like having two primary 
sponsors, but one just happens to pay less and demand less than the other. 
A major associate may have its logo on a car for one or two races a year. 
For instance, though DuPont is Jeff Gordon’s primary sponsor, Pepsi and 
Nicorette get top billing at a couple races each season. (See the color photos 
near the center of this book for examples of sponsorship logos.)
Contingency programs: Stick with these 
guys to make some money
 
Another way for companies to have their names linked with NASCAR is 
through a contingency program. Contingency awards are earned throughout 
the season by drivers whose cars display a company’s decal. Some of the best-
known contingency programs are the Coors Light Pole Award, given to the 
driver who has the fastest qualifying time, and the WIX Lap Leader program, 
which rewards the driver who leads the most laps in each race. Teams must 
display contingency program stickers on their cars or uniforms in order to be 
eligible for the bonus. Contingency programs are a way for race car parts sup-
pliers and other companies to advertise with and gain recognition for all the 
teams they work with, rather than dishing out money to just one team.

27
 Chapter 2: The Big Business of NASCAR
From T-shirts to motor oil: NASCAR fans 
support their drivers
Sponsors know what they’re doing. There’s a reason a race is named the 
Sylvania 300 and not “That 300-lap race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway.” 
There’s a reason Charlotte Motor Speedway was renamed Lowe’s Motor 
Speedway. And there’s a reason drivers thank their “DeWalt Ford” team when 
they have a great day at the race track. It’s because many NASCAR fans live and 
die by every word spoken by their favorite driver, every sponsor’s logo shown 
on their favorite driver’s car, and every paint scheme or uniform change.
NASCAR fans are loyal — a recent study revealed that three out of every four 
fans use NASCAR sponsors’ products. It’s a good guess that Petty fans still 
use STP oil treatment, even though it no longer sponsors Petty Enterprises, 
because STP was the team’s primary sponsor for so many years. And that 
makes NASCAR appealing to companies who want an interesting and effective 
marketing tool.
You can see evidence of how loyal NASCAR fans are without even going 
to a race. Just drive down the highway and look at bumper stickers. Some 
people just display the car number of their favorite driver; others show the 
car number of their least-favorite driver with a big, thick line through it. The 
same loyalty goes for the car manufacturers involved in the sport — some 
fans don’t necessarily prefer any one driver, but they root exclusively for 
Ford drivers. Not surprisingly, those fans usually have a Ford parked in their 
driveway — and vow never to own a General Motors car in their lifetime. 
Car companies couldn’t be happier about fans like that, particularly because 
those companies initially became involved in racing to market and sell more 
of their vehicles.
NASCAR fans are even more supportive at the races. You can see my fans from 
a mile away, wearing Mark Martin T-shirts, Mark Martin hats, Mark Martin jack-
ets, and even Mark Martin sneakers. It would be a tough task to find a fan in the 
grandstands who wasn’t wearing a shirt with a logo on it — except for the guys 
who get sunburned because they don’t wear any shirts at all!
Keeping up appearances
A rookie driver who hasn’t proven himself yet 
really doesn’t have much control over which 
company will sponsor his team. In most cases, 
that driver is so eager for a sponsor that he’ll 
take anyone. In my early years as a driver, I was 
thrilled to get a call from any company at all. 
Now, though, I can be choosy because of my 
success in the sport. I’ve been lucky to have 
Kellogg’s/CARQUEST as a primary sponsor.

When I was racing on the short tracks of Arkansas, I never thought I’d see 
people wearing T-shirts with my face on them or wearing hats with my name 
on them. But now it’s really cool because it shows how many people support 
me at the race track and cheer for me when I drive by. Because I wear an ear 
piece while in the car (for the in-car radio), as well as a tight helmet, and I 
have to contend with the roar of the engine, I can’t hear fans cheering when 
I’m driving. But seeing fans wearing my name on their clothing lets me know 
that I have people behind me.
Selling NASCAR Merchandise: Licenses 
Aren’t Just for Driving
With fans buying up all that NASCAR merchandise, it’s not surprising that 
some people would do anything to sell stuff to fans and get in on the action. 
But making that money isn’t simple. Just like you need a license to drive on 
the highway, you need a license to sell merchandise bearing the NASCAR 
name or drivers’ names. Otherwise, you can be fined or arrested. Getting 
licensed is a serious deal. Unless you want the cops chasing after you, taking 
all your merchandise, and giving you a big, fat ticket, get licensed if you’re 
interested in selling NASCAR paraphernalia.
Licensing gives people the authority to sell particular goods with a particular 
name, logo, or likeness on them. There’s a good reason why that’s necessary, 
from where I stand: It’s embarrassing to have my name or picture on some-
thing ridiculously ugly, poorly made, or extremely inappropriate. Souvenirs 
are part of the image, so a driver doesn’t want to be part of something that’s 
too hokey or that’s a cheap rip-off. Considering all the souvenir items float-
ing around out there, drivers have lots of opportunities to be part of cheesy, 
junky stuff — so somebody had better be watching out for their interests. 
There’s also a business aspect to insisting that everyone sell licensed mer-
chandise: Drivers make royalties off the licensed goods vendors sell — either 
a percentage of the selling price or just a flat fee.
 
When buying NASCAR souvenirs, make sure to look for the official NASCAR 
hologram sticker. If an item has this sticker, along with the official NASCAR 
logo, it’s guaranteed to be quality stuff and not some shoddy souvenir that 
will fall apart the moment you put it on or bring it home. The imitation may 
be cheaper than a licensed item, but don’t be fooled — the low price probably 
means low quality. Buying souvenirs from a driver’s souvenir trailer, which is 
located outside the track during races, is a sure way to be safe because it sells 
only licensed merchandise.

29
 Chapter 2: The Big Business of NASCAR
You can find nearly every souvenir imaginable relating to NASCAR, including 
everyday items and some really strange things:
 
✓ Clothing: The most obvious souvenirs are T-shirts, jackets, hats, and 
button-down shirts. Some less obvious items (for NASCAR fans who 
like a complete look) are socks, water bottles, and seat cushions with 
a driver’s name and car number on them. Fans are proud of the drivers 
they cheer for and often show up at events outfitted head-to-toe with 
merchandise that identifies them as a driver’s number-one supporter.
 
✓ Jewelry: With NASCAR’s growing popularity among women, NASCAR 
jewelry has taken off in sales. Souvenir stands and retail outlets stock 
almost anything you can imagine, including earrings, necklaces, brace-
lets, rings, and anklets.
 
✓ Home decorating: NASCAR fans don’t have to go far to fix up their 
homes with a NASCAR motif. Some licensees sell just about anything for 
the home, and a lot of that stuff has my name on it, too. You can even 
purchase NASCAR crystal platters and silverware for entertaining pur-
poses. I’m not saying that buying all this stuff will make your house styl-
ish, but it will definitely get a point across to your guests — that you’re a 
NASCAR fan through and through.
 
✓ Office supplies: Looking for NASCAR scissors or a Mark Martin ruler? 
Don’t fret, you can find them, along with stationery, pens, pencils, tele-
phones, and nearly everything else you need to get your work done fast 
enough to take a couple days off for a NASCAR race.
 
✓ Games: The toy business is also involved in stock-car racing. NASCAR 
video games are a big deal and a huge seller in stores. You can also find 
board and card games relating to the sport — they’re less high-tech but 
just as much fun.
 
✓ Books: Publishing has become more visible in the NASCAR business in 
recent years. The NASCAR Library Collection was introduced in early 
2004, helping differentiate authentic NASCAR-licensed books (like the 
one you’re reading) from others in the marketplace. NASCAR has even 
started licensing the wildly popular Harlequin novels — romance tales 
set in a NASCAR world.
 
✓ Die-cast cars: Perhaps the best-selling NASCAR souvenirs over the years 
have been die-cast cars, featuring the current year’s paint scheme on 
them and a driver’s name above the door, just like on real stock cars. 
These babies aren’t just your run-of-the-mill toy cars, though. They have 
working hoods, detailed cockpits, tiny engines, and functioning wheels. 
Many fans see them as collectors’ items, and they come in several sizes 
(1:64 scale to 1:24 scale). For serious collectors, some are made of 
24-karat gold and platinum.

My fans had a perfect chance at buying the quintessential Mark Martin souve-
nir through the Neiman Marcus catalog. The store had one of my race cars for 
sale, all painted up with a working race engine under the hood. I guess it was 
for diehard fans only because it cost $125,000 and wasn’t even legal to drive 
on the street! In fact, the headlights were only decals, as with all NASCAR cars, 
so driving it home from the store at night would have been challenging. But I 
bet the trip would have been quicker than usual.
Smile, You’re on NASCAR Camera!
There’s one telltale sign that NASCAR is popular in the United States: Its 
races are on TV. Every NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR Nationwide 
Series, and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race is broadcast on televi-
sion. (See Chapter 3 for the lowdown on the differences among the NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, and NASCAR Camping World 
Truck Series.) Qualifying rounds and even some practices are also televised. 
That’s amazing, considering the first NASCAR race broadcast live, flag-to-
flag, was only 30 years ago. That race, the 1979 Daytona 500 on CBS, brought 
racing action into America’s living rooms for an afternoon. Now racing is 
more than just a once-in-a-while show on TV. You can find it virtually every 
day because the racing season lasts from February through late November, 
the longest season of any professional sport. And one cable network, SPEED, 
is exclusively devoted to motor racing, with NASCAR competition making up 
much of its coverage.
Knock-down, drag-out NASCAR coverage
The first NASCAR race broadcast on live TV 
certainly made racing seem exciting to non-
NASCAR fans who tuned in. While Richard 
Petty won that 1979 Daytona 500, the most 
thrills came from drivers off the track. Bobby 
Allison and his brother Donnie Allison got into 
a scuffle with Cale Yarborough, with the TV 
cameras rolling as America got its first taste 
of NASCAR. That one event showed millions 
of new fans how emotional the sport can get. 
It also revealed that, just like in any other pro 
sport, NASCAR competitors can’t help but lose 
their tempers at times.

 Chapter 2: The Big Business of NASCAR
If you’re curious about racing but not ready to devote yourself to it, you can 
catch a peek of the sport before you dive into it as a fan. Turning on your 
TV is the first step. It won’t be long until you stumble upon a racing show in 
which races, qualifying runs, and practices are dissected, and everyone from 
the driver to the car owner to the guy who puts gas in the car is interviewed. 
You can find out more about racing than you ever wanted to know if you 
watch those shows long enough.
You can find NASCAR race broadcasts on the major broadcast networks and 
cable. The networks are beginning to delve into the sport more and more 
because TV ratings have grown each year since NASCAR races began show-
ing up on TV. (For more on NASCAR’s television partners, see Chapter 1.)
TV has become such a big deal in racing these days that broadcasters are 
quite innovative in the ways they bring the sport to viewers. Developments 
include in-car cameras, cameras underneath the chassis, and even cameras 
embedded in the track. From inside the car, viewers can see the driver turn 
the wheel and shift. From outside, viewers can see a car ahead of or behind 
the driver — and also see whether there is any contact between the two 
In the spotlight, under pressure
While sponsors drool about how much TV cov-
erage of the sport has grown (more TV means 
more footage of cars on the track, all zooming 
around with big corporate logos stuck onto 
them), for drivers that exposure heightens the 
pressure to lead races because the cameras 
get plenty of shots of the car out front.
TV coverage also puts a lot of pressure on drivers 
to speak well and behave in front of the camera. 
Every time drivers climb out of cars, camera 
lenses are watching, and reporters with micro-
phones are asking questions. After an on-track 
incident, drivers have to explain why and how 
it happened. The moment you come out of the 
infield care center (which is where you are taken 
after every crash, even if you’re not hurt at all), 
the cameras and microphones are waiting. And 
at the end of the race, no matter how frustrated, 
angry, hot, sweaty, thirsty, or tired you may be, 
reporters are there waiting for you to talk to them 
the instant you crawl out of your car.
Pro football, baseball, and hockey players at 
least get to cool off for a while in the locker 
room before the cameras and microphones 
come running. But for NASCAR drivers, that 
immediate media blitz has become a way of 
life, proving that NASCAR is the most acces-
sible sport in the world.

Part 1: NASCAR 101 
cars. When a driver crashes, the camera picks up plenty more action — like 
a wall coming straight at it or another car smacking into the rear bumper and 
then flying off into another car to cause trouble on the track. In really hard 
crashes, the camera can take only so much. Upon impact, the camera breaks, 
and the transmission goes black. Not all cars have these cameras for every 
race, but the shots from those cameras give great insight into what is going 
on during a race.
Shying away from cameras
When I began racing, I didn’t want to talk that 
much — much less look into a camera for the 
entire world to see. All I wanted to do was drive 
race cars and win races, and I was pretty shy 
about everything else. I figured that if I wanted 
to be famous and on TV, I wouldn’t be much of 
a race car driver.
As my career progressed, however, I figured 
out that being on TV was a great way to market 
myself, so I forced myself to get used to it. I was 
interviewed a lot when I ran on short tracks in 
the Midwest, mostly on local radio stations or 
on local television stations, so I had a lot of 
practice before graduating to NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series racing. Now, I don’t even think about 
being nervous because I’m on TV. I just think 
about winning races, as all top-level drivers do. 
Compared to that, the TV part is easy.

ASCAR racing is more than just one group of drivers traveling all over 
the United States to race. NASCAR has many different series, featur-
ing drivers from different places and with different levels of talent. From its 
smaller series to its biggest series, NASCAR racing has a series for every 
driver — and for every fan, too.
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series: 
Where the Superstars Are
NASCAR’s highest-profile series is the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, a racing 
league akin to the top leagues of other sports. The best hitters play in 
Major League Baseball, the best quarterbacks play in the National Football 
League, and the best stock-car drivers race in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. 
(For simplicity’s sake, I refer to NASCAR’s premier series as the NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series here, even though throughout history it’s been known 
by a number of different titles.) It features the most recognized drivers in 
stock-car racing, including ones you’ve probably seen on TV in some way or 
another — whether driving in a race, selling souvenirs on a 24-hour shopping 
network, or smiling into the camera during a commercial. Some of the most 
popular NASCAR Sprint Cup Series drivers today include the following:

34
Part I: NASCAR 101 
 
✓ Jeff Gordon began racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series in 1993 and 
quickly earned the nickname “Wonder Boy” because he was only 21. He 
legitimized that nickname when he won his first NASCAR Sprint Cup title 
in 1995 at 24, becoming the youngest champion in NASCAR’s Modern 
Era. (By the way, the term “Modern Era” refers to years from 1972 to the 
present. The distinction between this era and the seasons prior to 1972 
has everything to do with the length in schedule. Prior to 1972, some 
seasons had as many as 62 races. In 1972, the schedule was reduced to 
31 races.)
 
 Gordon followed his first NASCAR Sprint Cup title with back-to-back 
championships in 1997 and 1998, and a fourth in 2001. En route he broke 
records, won races, and frustrated his older and more experienced 
competitors.
 
 Gordon has since grown out of his “Wonder Boy” nickname and into a 
more mature role. He’s one of NASCAR’s unofficial spokesmen, espe-
cially to new fans who may not be familiar with the sport and who may 
not be from the southern United States. Gordon’s the embodiment of 
NASCAR’s growth in popularity. Prior to Gordon’s success, most drivers 
hailed from the Southeast. Gordon, though, grew up in California before 
moving to Indiana when he was 13.
 
✓ Jimmie Johnson, a California boy straight from Hollywood casting, won 
consecutive NASCAR Sprint Cup championships in 2006, 2007, and 2008, 
the second driver ever to pull a triple. (Cale Yarborough did it from 
1976–78.)
 
 In 2006, Johnson captured accolade after accolade. He won the season-
opening Daytona 500, the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, the Allstate 400 
at the Brickyard, and the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship. 
Winning just one of those is considered a highlight for an entire career, 
and he did it all in the same season. In 2007, Johnson’s dominance tran-
scended NASCAR. He won ten races, including four in a row during the 
Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup. (See Chapter 13 for details about 
what the Chase entails.) It was the first time since 1998 that a driver 
earned double-digit wins and won four consecutive races. In 2008, 
Johnson’s team became a dynasty. He once again dominated when the 
pressure was at its highest — during the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint 
Cup. In the final ten races, Johnson had three wins and five other top-ten 
finishes.
 
✓ Dale Earnhardt, Jr., the son of seven-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
champion Dale Earnhardt, came into the sport already a fan favorite, 
then backed up his family name by winning NASCAR Nationwide Series 
championships in 1998 and 1999. Jumping up to the NASCAR premier 
series ranks in 2000, Earnhardt, Jr. made steady gains each year, finish-
ing third in the 2003 standings while also being voted the series’ most 
popular driver.

35
 Chapter 3: Distinguishing the Different NASCAR Series
 
 Junior’s immense and sustained popularity is obvious — proven by his 
fans’ loyalty over the years. In 2008, he changed teams and sponsors, 
from Dale Earnhardt, Inc. and Budweiser to Hendrick Motorsports and 
AMP Energy and the National Guard. His fans change with him. The sea 
of Budweiser red quickly changed to a sea of AMP Energy green and 
National Guard blue.
 
✓ Tony Stewart is perhaps the last link between NASCAR’s new breed and 
the barnstorming race car drivers of past decades. Stewart stormed 
into NASCAR, winning the Raybestos Rookie of the Year in 1999 and fol-
lowing it up with two NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championships (2002 
and 2005). Prior to jumping to NASCAR competition, Stewart was an 
outstanding open-wheel driver, winning the 1997 IndyCar Series title. 
Stewart finally realized a dream in 2005, winning his most coveted race: 
the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard. An Indiana native, Stewart always con-
sidered a win at home track Indianapolis Motor Speedway to be his Holy 
Grail. He won there again in 2007.
 
✓ Carl Edwards loves to drive race cars. He can’t get enough of it. From 
2005 to 2008, Edwards ran full-time in both the NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series and the NASCAR Nationwide Series. Often times, those races 
weren’t at the same track. It wasn’t unusual for Edwards to fly back and 
forth to tracks during the same weekend, with trips taking him from 
California to Milwaukee and from Nashville to Pocono. Edwards won the 
NASCAR Nationwide Series title in 2007 and has fast become one of the 
biggest threats in the NASCAR Sprint Cup garage. He’s also got a pretty 
cool side gig: actor. Edwards had a role in the hit TV show 24 in 2006.
 
✓ Matt Kenseth is known as Mr. Consistency. From the first Chase for the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup in 2004 through the Chase in 2007, only Kenseth 
and Jimmie Johnson earned Chase berths each year. Kenseth was the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion in 2003, the final year under the 
old points system. (See Chapter 13 for an explanation of the old and 
new points systems.) That year, Kenseth had 25 top-ten finishes but just 
one win. Some say Kenseth is the sole reason the Chase was created — 
his 2003 consistency made the end-of-the-season drama vanish, as the 
championship was a foregone conclusion.
 
✓ Kyle Busch does everything fast. He drives fast, he wins fast, and he 
grew up fast. At the tender age of 20, Busch was winning NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series races. On September 4, 2005, at Auto Club Speedway in 
Fontana, California, Busch became the youngest driver to win a race in 
NASCAR Sprint Cup history. Since then, he’s been shattering records 
on a seemingly weekly basis. In 2008, he became the first driver to win 
three road course events in a single season. That same year, he also won 
at least one race in the NASCAR Sprint Cup, NASCAR Nationwide, and 
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series for the fourth year in a row.

Part I: NASCAR 101 
 
My goal always was to make it to NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing, which I 
believe is the hardest and most recognized racing series in the world. If you 
race open-wheel cars (see Chapter 1), you dream about making it to Formula 
One someday. But if you race stock cars, you think about the NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series day and night: It gets the most live TV coverage, pays the most 
money, and earns the most fame for its drivers.
Not only does NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing feature some of the best and 
most colorful drivers in motorsports, but it also has some of the closest fin-
ishes. Many times, cars race bumper-to-bumper and side-by-side during an 
event — mostly because NASCAR monitors its rules so closely that no car or 
car manufacturer has an unfair edge over the competition. Even after a 500-
mile race, it’s not uncommon for drivers to cross the finish line within one 
second of each other. Even in qualifying, where drivers complete only one or 
two laps at full speed in order to earn a spot in the race, the fastest and the 
slowest cars are often separated by a fraction of a second.
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races are held at tracks across the United States — 
from Daytona Beach, Florida, to suburban Los Angeles to Loudon, New 
Hampshire. Races are held nearly every weekend of the year, too. The 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series had 36 races in 2008, making its schedule one of 
the most — if not the most — grueling in all of professional sports. Please 
don’t think that drivers work only 36 days out of the year. A race weekend

Going overseas
Even though NASCAR racing is based in the 
United States, it has held several exhibition 
races outside the country. Drivers raced in 
Japan once a year from 1996 to 1998 — twice 
on a road course in Suzuka and once on a 
newly-built oval track in Motegi. It was quite 
a culture shock for NASCAR drivers and their 
teams to travel about 8,000 miles from home 
and arrive in a place where they didn’t under-
stand the language, customs, or food and drink. 
You’ve got to remember that sushi, which is raw 
fish, and sake, which is a beverage made from 
fermented rice, aren’t exactly part of the menu 
when drivers travel to events in Talladega, 
Alabama, or Darlington, South Carolina. When 
I went to Japan in 1997, however, I didn’t think 
about the food or surroundings as much as I 
thought about the race. I won the pole at the 
road course in Suzuka and finished second in 
the race, right behind Mike Skinner.
But it may have been 2005 when NASCAR truly 
went global. In 2005, the NASCAR Nationwide 
Series raced at the famed Autodromo Hermanos 
Rodriguez road course in Mexico City. It was 
the very first time NASCAR ran a points race 
outside the United States. And two years later, 
in 2007, NASCAR headed north of the border 
to Montreal, Canada, and the Circuit Gilles 
Villeneuve road course. Unfortunately, I wasn’t 
part of either of those history-making trips — I 
was busy concentrating on my NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series duties back in the States.

 Chapter 3: Distinguishing the Different NASCAR Series
entails at least two, and most often three, days of work (qualifying, practice, 
and the race), as well as one day of travel. See Chapter 8 for a day-by-day 
account of a driver’s life.
Even so, drivers and crew members don’t mind the rigorous schedule that 
much, particularly because they realize how fortunate they are to have made 
it to the top level of stock-car racing. While some drivers are able to get a job 
in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series early in their racing careers, most drivers 
spend years trying to get there. Those drivers dedicate their lives to their 
goal of making it to NASCAR Sprint Cup competition, spending a lot of time 
away from their families while competing in the various series that travel 
throughout the country.
NASCAR Nationwide Series: One Route 
to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series
A lot of drivers, including me, ended up in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series via 
the NASCAR Nationwide Series — a place where drivers can train themselves 
by getting experience, making mistakes, and learning from those errors. The 
series, which started in 1982, was originally sponsored by Busch Beer. In 
2008, Nationwide Insurance came aboard as the title sponsor.
NASCAR Nationwide Series races are usually held on Saturdays, while 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races are most often on Sundays. But that’s not 
the only difference. NASCAR Nationwide Series drivers drive stock cars 
and follow the same on-track rules as in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series (see 
Chapter 6), but the cars have a couple fundamental differences. Here are 
some unique aspects of each car:
 
✓ Shape: Here’s an easy way to tell the difference between a NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series car and a NASCAR Nationwide Series car: open your 
eyes. The new car now used full-time in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
looks very different from the old car (which was similar to the NASCAR 
Nationwide vehicle). The new NASCAR Sprint Cup car has a front splitter 
and a rear wing, two components absent from the NASCAR Nationwide 
race car.
 
✓ Size: Although NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and NASCAR Nationwide 
Series cars are nearly the same height (53.5 inches and 50.5 inches, 
respectively), the wheelbase (the distance between the front and rear 
axles) is slightly different. On a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car, the 
wheelbase is 110 inches, while on a NASCAR Nationwide Series race car, 
it’s 105 inches. NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars have an advantage here: 
Their longer wheelbase gives them more stability.

38
Part I: NASCAR 101 
 
✓ Weight: Though you’d need a pretty precise — and huge — scale 
to notice, there is a slight weight difference between the two cars. 
The NASCAR Sprint Cup car weighs 3,450 pounds, while the NASCAR 
Nationwide vehicle weights 3,400 pounds. (Measurements are taken 
without the driver in the car.)
 
✓ Horsepower: NASCAR Sprint Cup cars have significantly more oomph 
to them, producing about 850 horsepower. Horsepower is a unit of mea-
surement representing how much power an engine generates. The more 
horsepower, the faster the car. NASCAR Nationwide Series engines gen-
erate around 750 horsepower. That means NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
cars should be faster than NASCAR Nationwide cars, correct? Yes — and 
no. Though they have smaller engines, NASCAR Nationwide Series race 
cars don’t have to lug around as much weight as NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series cars. Fifty pounds lighter than NASCAR Sprint Cup cars, NASCAR 
Nationwide Series race cars do reach speeds that are nearly as fast.
 
✓ Compression ratio: All three national series in NASCAR racing now use 
the same compression ratio (12 to 1), which is the volume inside a cyl-
inder compared to the volume it compresses to when the piston is fully 
extended. The higher the ratio, the less space the mixture of fuel and air 
is shoved into, so the greater the potential for energy. (For more details 
on the technical aspects of stock cars, see Chapter 5.)
The NASCAR Nationwide Series: 
Not a bush league
The NASCAR Nationwide Series, which evolved 
from the NASCAR Late Model Sportsman 
Series, is considered a stepping stone for the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. But many driv-
ers bristle at that image. Some, like two-time 
NASCAR Nationwide Series champion Randy 
LaJoie, love racing in that series and have made 
a career out of it, saying it has the same intense 
competition as the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
and isn’t just a stepping stone. LaJoie espe-
cially likes the fact that, even though he doesn’t 
get paid as much as NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
drivers do, he doesn’t have to deal with nearly 
as much pressure.
The NASCAR Nationwide Series began in 1982 
and has grown from races at small, unknown 
tracks to competitions at large, well-known 
facilities and includes nearly as many races 
as the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series does. Many 
races are companion events to NASCAR Sprint 
Cup races and are held on Saturdays of most 
race weekends at a particular track. That gives 
NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers a chance to drive, 
as I do, in both races in one weekend. And even 
though NASCAR Nationwide Series drivers 
themselves are quite popular with fans, having 
NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers in the race lures 
even more people to the race track.

39
 Chapter 3: Distinguishing the Different NASCAR Series
 
The NASCAR Nationwide Series was a valuable training ground for me, and I 
haven’t turned my back on those races now, even though I have been success-
ful in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series for more than a decade. I still compete 
in a limited number of NASCAR Nationwide Series races every year, mostly 
because I love to race — and win. In fact, I’ve won more NASCAR Nationwide 
races than anyone in history, 48 as of 2008. Because the cars are different, 
some technical information on how to set them up isn’t the same. But overall, 
running in a NASCAR Nationwide Series race prior to NASCAR Sprint Cup com-
petition gives me hints on how my NASCAR Sprint Cup car will handle on a 
particular track.
S
 
Although winning a NASCAR Nationwide Series race on Saturday gives me 
more confidence for Sunday’s NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events, racing twice 
in one weekend is tough. I hardly have any time to stop and take a breath. I 
get to the garage early to check out the Saturday car and talk to my Saturday 
crew chief, then hop over to my NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car. Then I have 
to juggle NASCAR Nationwide Series practice with NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
practice and then qualify for both races. Sometimes I’m so busy with that and 
signing autographs on my way from one garage to the other that I forget to eat!
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series: 
Pickups with Racing Stripes
In 1994, NASCAR decided to branch out and create another major racing 
series. But it didn’t opt for another stock-car series, which may have been 
too similar to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series or the NASCAR Nationwide 
Series. Instead, it chose something completely different — and quite creative. 
It started racing pickup trucks.
NASCAR bigwigs sensed the series would catch on because an overwhelm-
ing majority of truck owners are interested in some type of motorsports. The 
truck manufacturers were into the idea, and plenty of talented drivers were 
looking for jobs, so why not?
In 1995, the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series was created, with Mike 
Skinner taking the first championship. The series has worked as a breeding 
ground: Many drivers from this series advance to the NASCAR Nationwide 
Series and NASCAR Sprint Cup Series ranks, although Skinner, after climbing 
the ladder, returned to the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.
The NASCAR Camping World Truck season is shorter than the NASCAR Sprint 
Cup or NASCAR Nationwide schedule. The series runs 25 races per year — 
compared to 36 in the NASCAR Sprint Cup and 35 in the NASCAR Nationwide 
Series. The races, run on Friday nights or Saturday afternoons, take place 
on many of the same tracks as the NASCAR Sprint Cup, and they sometimes 
S

40
Part I: NASCAR 101 
occur in the same weekend as a companion race. There’s one major differ-
ence: NASCAR Camping World Truck races are much shorter — often half the 
length of the NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
Even though NASCAR Camping World Truck Series vehicles don’t look or feel 
much like NASCAR Sprint Cup cars, good drivers can handle both vehicles 
pretty well. To true race car drivers, a vehicle is a vehicle, and a race is a 
race. If a driver is skillful enough to be able to control a vehicle, he can suc-
ceed in any series and in any vehicle.
The following are some differences between passenger trucks (such as a 
Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado, Dodge Ram, and Toyota Tundra) and their 
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series counterparts (see Figure 3-1):
 
✓ Horsepower: A passenger truck has 160 horsepower. Compare that to 
the race truck, which has about 750.
 
✓ Length: Passenger trucks are an average 194.5 inches long, while a race 
truck is 206 inches long.

 Chapter 3: Distinguishing the Different NASCAR Series
 
✓ Width: Passenger trucks are an average of 76.8 inches wide. A race truck 
is 75 inches.
 
✓ Height: Passenger trucks are an average of 70 inches high, and race 
trucks are an average of 59 inches — shorter and much closer to the 
ground than their passenger truck counterparts.
 
✓ Weight: A passenger truck weighs an average of 3,829 pounds, and a 
race truck is 3,400 pounds. Because the race trucks don’t have to be 
sturdy to haul things like fill dirt or your neighbor’s couch, their bodies 
are much lighter and as streamlined as possible.
 
✓ Wheelbase: A passenger truck’s front and rear wheels are 117.5 inches 
apart. On a race truck, that measurement is 112 inches.
 
✓ Engine: A passenger truck’s engine is a 4.3-liter V6 with fuel injection. A 
race truck has an 8-cylinder engine with a carburetor.
 
✓ Compression ratio: A passenger truck’s compression ratio is 9 to 1. A 
race truck’s ratio is 12 to 1. (I explain what the compression ratio is in 
the previous section of this chapter.)
NASCAR Whelen All-American Series: 
The Foundation of NASCAR
The NASCAR Whelen All-American Series, made up of local tracks across 
the United States and Canada, dates back more than 25 years and is 
NASCAR’s national championship program for short-track race car drivers. 
Championships are decided on the track, at the U.S. state and Canadian prov-
ince level, in addition to determining the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series 
champion.
 
The tracks in the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series are called short 
tracks because they’re all under a mile in length. They run a weekly program, 
usually on the same night each weekend, and offer an affordable form of family 
entertainment.
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stars such as Greg Biffle, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., and 
Kyle Busch got their start running at their local home tracks. In addition to 
seeing the stars of tomorrow, fans at a NASCAR Whelen All-American Series 
event can cheer on their neighbors, coworkers, or friends who are racing for 
the pure enjoyment of the competition.
The tracks in the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series offer a variety of divi-
sions, depending on the track owner’s preference, the track’s location, and 
its history. For example, tracks in the Northeast spotlight the Modified divi-
sion, while tracks in other parts of the country run Late Models. Tracks on 
either coast run primarily on asphalt, while in the Midwest they run on dirt.

42
Part I: NASCAR 101 
 
Modifieds are open-wheel cars that resemble high-powered go-karts — they 
have a wide wheel base and no fenders, and they sit low to the ground. 
Late Model cars that race on asphalt resemble those run in the NASCAR 
Nationwide Series but with less weight and less horsepower. A Late Model 
that runs on dirt looks like a cross between the two — picture a Modified car 
with fenders and a hood.
In addition, most local tracks have a variety of divisions that are low-cost 
alternatives to their premier class. For example, nearly every track has an 
entry-level division in which the rules are set up to minimize the amount of 
work and money that are spent souping the car up. It’s common for a driver 
to start in one division and work his or her way up through the ranks.
Often NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stars will return to their home tracks in their 
free time to race the local division and meet with the fans.
NASCAR Touring Divisions: The 
Lifeblood of NASCAR Racing
Most stock-car drivers begin racing at a track near their homes, where the 
need for traveling money isn’t an issue. After a driver conquers his home-
track championship, however, he often advances to one of NASCAR’s touring 
divisions, which travel to different race tracks within the same region during 
their seasons. Touring division — also known as developmental series — 
competition is where drivers step up on the financial ladder and start signing 
up well-heeled sponsors to help finance their efforts, in hopes of reaching the 
top NASCAR series. Racing at this level is much more expensive than running 
at a home track, where crew members are volunteers and often are chosen 
from among a driver’s friends. It is less expensive, however, than racing 
in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, or NASCAR 
Camping World Truck Series.
Home and touring division tracks are generally less than a mile in length, 
compared with the much larger speedways in use by the premier series. 
The touring division, for example, doesn’t race at the 2.66-mile Talladega 
Superspeedway in Alabama. However, the short-track skills a driver hones 
during touring division competition can benefit him greatly when he reaches 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series or NASCAR Nationwide Series competition and 
races at tracks such as the half-mile Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee. 
When a driver jumps from the touring division to one of NASCAR’s premier 
divisions, he is also able to earn a living as a professional race car driver.

43
 Chapter 3: Distinguishing the Different NASCAR Series
The touring division includes two Modified tours (the NASCAR Whelen 
Modified Tour and the NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour), a divi-
sion that dates back to the beginnings of NASCAR; two international series 
(NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and NASCAR Mexico Series); and the NASCAR 
Camping World Series, the final step in the developmental ladder. Here’s the 
lowdown on each:
 
✓ NASCAR Whelen Modified tours: The NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour 
is a regional touring series that runs primarily in the northeast. It visits 
venerable NASCAR tracks like Stafford Motor Speedway and Thompson 
International Speedway in Connecticut, and Riverhead Raceway in 
New York, as well as running twice a year at New Hampshire Motor 
Speedway. The Whelen Modified Tour was formed in 1985 and has fea-
tured drivers like seven-time champion Mike Stefanik, five-time cham-
pion Tony Hirschman, Jr., and two-time champion and former NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series driver Jimmy Spencer.
 
 The Modified championship lineage stretches back to Red Byron’s 1948 
NASCAR championship and includes NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cham-
pion and Daytona 500 winner Bobby Allison, nine-time champion Richie 
Evans, six-time champion Jerry Cook, and three-time champion Bugs 
Stevens. The Modified cars (referred to as Modifieds) are unique in their 
high-power, wide-tire, open-wheel form. This is NASCAR’s only open-
wheel division, and the Modifieds are 2,610 pounds and run tires more 
than 20 inches wider than their stock-car brethren.
 
 The NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour began its fourth season in 
2008 and runs primarily in the south. Running identical cars as its north-
ern cousin, the NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour makes stops at 
historic NASCAR venues such as Caraway Speedway and Bowman Gray 
Stadium in North Carolina and Greenville-Pickens Speedway in South 
Carolina.
 
✓ NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and NASCAR Mexico Series: The 2007 
season featured two significant international milestones for NASCAR: It 
was the inaugural season for both the NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and 
the NASCAR Mexico Series.
 
 NASCAR has a strong fan base in Canada and has a long history in the 
country, having held sanctioned events in many different NASCAR divi-
sions dating back to the 1950s. The NASCAR Canadian Tire Series is 
broadcast on TSN, Canada’s leading sports television network.
 
 The NASCAR Mexico Series is run from March to November primarily 
on ovals with a handful of road courses. It is broadcast in Mexico on 
Televisa.
 
 The NASCAR Canadian Tire Series and NASCAR Mexico Series both run 
stock cars with slightly less weight and horsepower than the NASCAR

Part I: NASCAR 101 
Nationwide Series and NASCAR Camping World Series (which I explain 
next). The NASCAR Canadian Tire Series features cars similar to those in 
the NASCAR Nationwide Series, but the body is smaller, and the horse-
power is much less. The NASCAR Mexico Series features cars similar to 
those used in Late Model classes at short tracks in the United States, 
with composite bodies and spec engines: cost-saving features that 
NASCAR introduced in 2006. The composite body is made from fiberglass 
and is one single piece (instead of separate parts pieced together like in 
the NASCAR Sprint Cup cars). A spec engine is an “off the shelf” engine 
that costs much less than a typical NASCAR Sprint Cup engine. The spec 
engines are the same strength as the pricier engines, but teams cannot 
tinker with their components.
 
✓ NASCAR Camping World Series: Two key changes in 2007 firmly 
entrenched the NASCAR Camping World Series at the top of the race 
car driver’s developmental ladder. First, NASCAR lowered the minimum 
age to 16 years old to provide a proving ground for NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series teams’ developmental drivers. Then, Camping World provided 
an entitlement sponsor for the long-standing NASCAR Grand National 
Division, East and West Series. Previously, the East and West had been 
viewed as two regional series. By putting it under one brand, NASCAR 
elevated the national awareness of the series.
 
 The NASCAR Camping World Series is made up of two regional tours, 
the East and the West. The East features events throughout the Atlantic 
seaboard, while the West runs along the Pacific coast and in a number 
of western states. Both run at a challenging combination of short tracks, 
intermediates, road courses, and speedways, with a number of races 
held in combination with NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events.
 
 The NASCAR Camping World Series features a blend of established driv-
ers who have made the series their home and up-and-coming prospects 
looking to make the jump to one of NASCAR’s three national series. The 
series has helped launch the careers of current NASCAR Sprint Cup stars 
like Kevin Harvick, Martin Truex, Jr., David Gilliland, Joey Logano, and 
two-time champion crew chief Greg Zipadelli.
 
 Other recent changes to the NASCAR Camping World Series include an 
expanded geographic reach, new competition and cost-containment 
initiatives such as the new spec engine and composite body (explained 
earlier in this section), and an increasingly diverse field of drivers. The 
NASCAR Camping World Series cars are similar to NASCAR Nationwide 
Series cars; they have a 105- and 110-inch wheelbase, weigh 3,250 to 
3,300 pounds, and have 625 horsepower at 8,000 rpm. The Camping 
World Series is televised on HDNet and SPEED.
 
✓ NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown: The NASCAR developmental (or 
touring) series schedule is capped off by the NASCAR Toyota All-Star 

45
 Chapter 3: Distinguishing the Different NASCAR Series
Showdown. First run in 2003, the annual postseason, non-points NASCAR 
Camping World Series event has grown into the Daytona 500 of short-
track racing. It’s been won by Austin Cameron (2003), Mike Johnson 
(2004), David Gilliland (2005), Matt Kobyluck (2006), and Joey Logano 
(2007). The first five races were held in the fall, but starting in 2009, 
the event was moved to January. The race weekend also includes two 
NASCAR Whelen All-American Series races. The NASCAR Toyota All-Star 
Showdown is held at the Toyota Speedway in Irwindale, California (just 
outside of Los Angeles), a first-class, half-mile track.

The Ride of Your Life:
How to Land a Job in NASCAR
In This Chapter
▶ Getting some driving experience
▶ Recognizing the role of scouts
▶ Living life in the pits
S
uppose you’re sitting on the couch one day watching a NASCAR race, 
and you decide that NASCAR racing is for you. You want to know what it 
feels like to drive 180 mph, two inches from the guy in front of you. You want 
to tour the country and sign autographs for adoring fans. What’s the first 
step? This chapter explains what it takes to get in the action.
So, You Want to Drive a Race Car?
Although you can buy yourself a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car if you have 
enough money and you can find a team willing to sell, that doesn’t mean you 
can sign up for the Daytona 500. NASCAR issues its own racing licenses; in 
order to qualify, a competitor has to meet a long list of specifications, includ-
ing having previous racing experience.
You also have to have a lot of cash — or the ability to get a lot of cash from 
sponsors, friends, or a rich uncle. Racing isn’t cheap. Running a good car at 
a local track can cost $40,000 per season, and an engine can cost another 
$20,000. You also need more money to maintain the car; buy tires, oil, and 
gas; and fix the car when you dent it. And believe me, you will dent it — 
because every driver, no matter how talented he or she may be, runs into 
obstacles every once in a while (some more often than others).

48
Part I: NASCAR 101 
 Starting with a pre-stock 
(not prehistoric) vehicle
If you don’t have enough money to buy a full-fledged stock car, you can race 
more inexpensively with a go-kart. Go-karts are similar to the ones you see 
on tracks adjacent to miniature golf courses. They are tiny vehicles — tiny in 
relation to stock cars, that is — with engines attached to the back. But start-
ing out in go-karts doesn’t mean you’re starting out in racing kindergarten. 
Certain go-karts can reach up to 100 mph, and they even race on a course at 
Daytona International Speedway, using part of its high-banked track. Also, 
you have to sharpen the same driving skills to drive a go-kart that you do for 
a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car or a NASCAR Nationwide Series car. Ricky 
Rudd showed the virtues of go-karts when he went straight from them to 
NASCAR Sprint Cup racing. Go-karts are a viable option — and a great place 
to get started — if you’re itching to race.
 
You can also find all sorts of programs for kids who want to start young. Midget 
cars are one of them. Midgets are specialized open-wheel race cars that are 
small, fast, lightweight, and have no fenders. They graduate in size, going from 
quarter midgets to three-quarter midgets to midgets, the largest cars in the 
class. Quarter midgets are the cars kids squeeze into for some fun. Jeff Gordon 
started out in midget cars, so you must be able to learn a thing or two there.
Moving up to a stock car
Obviously, the first thing you need in order to get into stock-car racing is a 
stock car. If you’ve scrounged up enough money to buy a stock car and want 
to begin your training, what should you do next? You can’t just walk into 
your local auto dealership and buy a race-ready stock car. Here are a couple 
avenues you can take to locate a stock car:
 
✓ Visit your local track. Most local tracks are very fan-friendly, so you can 
spend lots of time in the garage and in the pits. Ask if anyone is selling a 
car — you may get lucky!
 
✓ Pick up any racing trade magazine, such as Speedway Illustrated or 
National Speed Sport News. You can find classified ads for cars and car 
parts in the back of many trade publications. You can find these publica-
tions online, at book stores, and at some newsstands.
Securing a NASCAR license
After you get a car, you have to get a license. To pick up an application for a 
NASCAR license, take a trip to your local short track (which means any track 
less than 1 mile in length; see Chapter 14). Or log on to www.nascar
members.com on the Web, and follow the links for a NASCAR license. Your 
car owner (if it isn’t you) and your crew members — everyone directly 

49
 Chapter 4: The Ride of Your Life: How to Land a Job in NASCAR
involved in your race team at the track — need to get licenses, too. (In a 
moment, I discuss how to get a pit crew, and I give you the lowdown on all 
your racing team members in Chapter 7.) Your NASCAR license is either sent 
directly to you or to the track at which you’ll be racing.
Getting a pit crew
You need to gather up people for your pit crew because you’ll need those 
people — at least two of them — on race day. Your pit crew will be in charge 
of your car, tires, and fuel, and will talk to you on the radio during the race. 
So when choosing a pit crew, choose carefully. Your 70-pound kid brother 
may not be the best choice. In fact, many crews in the NASCAR Nationwide 
and NASCAR Sprint Cup Series are made up of former college football play-
ers and wrestlers. With each tire weighing about 50 pounds and each gas can 
weighing about 80, most crew members have to be extremely powerful. And 
they need practice. Every pit crew practices during the week, whether it be 
for pit stop precision or for weight training.
When you first start out — and have little disposable income — pit crew 
members are usually volunteers who either do it for the love of racing or 
because they’re working their way up (just like you are). As you progress, 
and the crew’s importance grows, you will have to pay them. The higher the 
level of racing you reach, the more the crew gets paid.
Memorizing the rules
With your NASCAR license, you receive a rule book for the series in which 
you plan to compete. You can choose whichever series you like, but either 
NASCAR or the track must approve you to race. (See Chapter 3 for more on 
the different NASCAR series.) In the rule book, you can find a rule for every 
aspect of racing — especially for all the details and measurements of your 
car. You should plan to tweak your car for at least a week or two before set-
ting a date for your first race.
Moving up and out
As you become successful on your local short track, you can move up to a 
touring series, which travels from track to track — and sometimes all over 
the nation. I outline the various NASCAR touring series in Chapter 3. To be 
eligible for a touring series, you have to first get a license for that particular 
series, just as you do when you first start racing at your local track.
When you start touring, the logistics get more complicated, and the expenses 
become bigger. To get your car from track to track, you need a trailer. A 
smaller team will hook up an open trailer to the back of a car and drive from 
track to track. Big teams sometimes have full-sized haulers. The same idea 
applies for transporting your crew: Smaller teams in the smaller series drive 
to each track, and bigger teams in the bigger series fly.

50
Part I: NASCAR 101 
Seeking approval to join the big leagues
When you want to try your hand at the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, 
the NASCAR Nationwide Series, or the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, NASCAR 
officials get more involved in the licensing process. They do so mostly 
because they don’t want some unskilled guy off the street getting in a truck 
or a car and taking out the whole field because he doesn’t know how to drive.
Before you get on the track in NASCAR’s top series, you have to submit a 
résumé and an application to NASCAR for review. Officials license you to race 
in those series when they determine that you’re good enough, judging by 
your résumé and records in other series. Your car owner and everyone who 
participates on your race team also have to obtain licenses — the only differ-
ence is that they don’t have to submit résumés. After you’re approved, you 
have to pay an annual fee for your license.
Attracting Talent Scouts
Like other major sports stars, most big-time NASCAR drivers have worked 
their way up to the big leagues and earned their rides. They had to be 
noticed. Just as scouts are always on the lookout for a young fireballer strik-
ing out 20 hitters in a game or a prodigy hoopster who can dunk at the age of 
10, NASCAR scouts are always searching for fresh talent as well.
 
Teams are often looking for a developmental driver. A developmental driver 
is someone a team wants to groom to become the next big thing. After a team 
signs a developmental driver, one of two things happens: Either that driver 
tests for the team by practicing a car at different tracks, or he races right away 
in one of the lower-tier series.
The easiest way to get noticed by a team is to win. (It’s also the hardest way, 
depending on how you look at it.) Word travels fast in the racing community. 
A driver who consistently wins will get noticed — it’s as simple as that. Being 
persistent helps, too. For instance, NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl 
Edwards handed out business cards with the title “Race Car Driver” on them to 
team owners. But that wasn’t enough. He also had talent and a winning résumé. 
You can badger all you want, but if you don’t win, it’s not going to happen.
Here are a few of the NASCAR scouting systems you want to be aware of:
 
✓ Gillett Evernham Motorsports: Legendary crew chief turned car owner 
Ray Evernham is hands-on when it comes to finding his next star. While 
his name and reputation bring plenty of résumés to his desk, Ray 
actively seeks talented young drivers while he is racing or visiting his 
home track in New Jersey.

51
 Chapter 4: The Ride of Your Life: How to Land a Job in NASCAR
 
✓ Chip Ganassi Racing: Chip Ganassi Racing relies heavily on team 
manager Lorin Ranier, a Kentucky native whose father and grandfa-
ther owned NASCAR race teams (which won three Daytona 500s in the 
1980s). Lorin grew up following his father around the race shop and 
track — not working on the race cars but being a part of the team own-
ership process. In their last year of ownership, the Rainers signed Tony 
Stewart in 1996 to run a limited schedule, then sold his contract to Joe 
Gibbs a year later and retired from team ownership. Lorin moved on to 
consult for other teams and drivers including Matt Kenseth and Jimmie 
Johnson when they were starting their NASCAR careers.
 
✓ Drive for Diversity: NASCAR’s Drive for Diversity program seeks to 
develop diverse drivers and crew members. Since the creation of Drive 
for Diversity (D4D) in 2004, 25 minority and/or women drivers have 
driven in NASCAR’s developmental series.
Working on a Crew
It’s much easier to become a member of a race team than it is to become 
a driver, mainly because each car has only one driver but dozens of team 
members. Some team employees who work at the shop during the week also 
travel to an event and serve as race-day crew members, changing tires or put-
ting in gas. In recent years, however, the majority of race-day crew members 
are specialists who don’t work at the shop, while other team members, such 
as engineers, fabricators, and painters, don’t travel on weekends.
In this increasingly specialized field, one way to start working for a team is 
by sweeping the shop floor — not a very glamorous job but an avenue that 
can be followed by someone wishing to eventually expand his duties. Just ask 
Jeff Gordon’s crew chief, Steve Letarte. He was hired as a floor sweeper when 
he was just a junior in high school. Now he’s calling the shots for one of the 
most famous NASCAR drivers in history.
 
You can’t really become a NASCAR mechanic if you can’t fix a car. Some 
people learn all about cars after getting their initial jobs at race shops. They 
show interest and learn from experts, all without getting caught under peo-
ple’s feet. I’ve got to warn you, though, that it may take you a long time to get 
promoted from sweeper to mechanic or from sweeper to fabricator (someone 
who builds the outside, or body, of the car) if you’re learning along the way. 
If you already have a working knowledge of cars, you’ll be promoted much 
faster.

52
Part I: NASCAR 101 
Another way to sharpen your car skills is to go to a vocational school and 
take classes on how to fix engines or work on bodies. Some schools offer a 
specific curriculum that focuses on teaching students how to build and repair 
NASCAR-type cars. In fact, NASCAR has its own such school, the NASCAR 
Technical Institute, which it operates in partnership with Universal Technical 
Institute, a vocational school with locations across the country. The NASCAR 
Technical Institute opened on July 1, 2002, in Mooresville, North Carolina, 
just north of Charlotte, which is known as “Race City U.S.A.” because of the 
many NASCAR shops located there. In the future, NASCAR plans to open tech-
nical institutes in other cities.
Going Fast without Going Broke
If setting up a racing operation is out of your budget, there are other ways 
to experience the thrill of driving a NASCAR-regulation car at above-average 
speeds. Many racing schools teach the fundamentals of on-track maneuver-
ing, such as safely learning to run down straightaways and through corners, 
as well as how to pass. These schools include the Richard Petty Driving 
Experience, which travels the country and allows you to either ride along 
with a professional or get behind the wheel yourself. At the Fast Track High 
Performance Driving School, which operates out of Lowe’s Motor Speedway 
in Concord, North Carolina, students divide their time between classroom 
instruction and actually driving on the speedway.
Pit crews aren’t the pits
If you don’t want to work on the car all week at 
the shop but want to help out during pit stops 
on race day, there are opportunities for you 
in NASCAR racing. (See Chapter 11 for more 
details on what pit stops involve.) You may have 
a tough time getting a job on a pit crew if you 
don’t know somebody on the team, though, so 
be prepared to schmooze or make friends fast. 
Also, pit stops have become such a big factor in 
racing that you have to try out for the pit crew 
before you get the job. You’d better lift some 
weights and practice changing tires before you 
show up at a race team’s door.
The easiest way to get on a crew is to be will-
ing to do anything, including sweeping floors, to 
get your foot in the door. If you’re an efficient, 
enthusiastic floor sweeper, people will notice 
you, and you’ll get promoted before you know 
it. It’s true what they say: floor sweeper today, 
crew chief tomorrow. Well, maybe it takes 
longer than that, but that strategy has definitely 
worked in the past. Some people I know, includ-
ing my former crew chiefs Robin Pemberton 
and Steve Hmiel, wanted to be on a race team 
when they were young and were brave enough 
to make a bold move. They just packed up, left 
their hometowns, and headed for Charlotte, 
North Carolina, where most of the NASCAR 
Sprint Cup race shops are, hoping to get a job 
(any job!) with a team. Obviously, it worked out 
for Robin and Steve, but others have gone that 
route successfully, too.

What Makes It 
Stock-Car Racing?

In this part . . .

ASCAR stock cars have no doors, no speedometer, 
and no stereo with a sub-woofer. If these facts 
bewilder you, dive into this part. You can find lots of infor-
mation about NASCAR race cars and how they differ from 
passenger cars. In the end, you realize why it’s impractical 
and impossible to enter your four-door Ford Fusion in the 
Daytona 500, even though a herd of Ford Fusions will be 
racing.
Even if you’re fluent in several languages, understanding 
NASCAR-talk may still be difficult. Sway bar? Carburetor 
restrictor plate? Engine dynamometer? These phrases are 
commonly used in NASCAR racing but not at your bingo 
parlor or hair salon. You can’t even find most of them in 
your dictionary. But never fear, I define these words and 
plenty more in this part.
In addition to helping you understand the basic compo-
nents of a stock car, this part fills you in on the rules and 
inspections of NASCAR racing. You meet all the people 
who have to follow those rules, including the important 
members of race teams. You also find out that I do other 
things besides drive a race car on Sundays!

ASCAR racing has changed since its early days of passenger cars with 
numbers painted or taped on the sides. In those days, the cars raced 
were often drivers’ family cars — cars that fans could go out and buy off the 
showroom floor of the local dealership the same day they saw them race. 
Manufacturers wanted their cars to win so they could benefit from a unique 
type of advertising. As the saying went, “Win on Sunday, sell on Monday.”
Today, the cars are anything but “stock.” They are custom built from the 
ground up. The only thing vaguely stock about them is the general shape 
of the body. Teams have engineered ways to make the cars’ bodies more 
aerodynamic, devised methods of producing more horsepower while keep-
ing the engine sturdy, and, with much help and guidance from NASCAR, have 
devised new safety features to protect the drivers. After all these innova-
tions, describing the differences between a passenger car and a stock car is 
like describing the differences between mini-golf and the PGA tour.
In this chapter, I discuss the major differences between passenger cars and 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars, giving you an overview of what you see on 
the track every weekend.
Finding Four Car Models on the Track
Four car models now make up the entries in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
(see Figure 5-1):

cars used 
in NASCAR 
races.
 
 
✓ Chevrolet Impala
 
✓ Dodge Charger
 
✓ Ford Fusion
 
✓ Toyota Camry
Each manufacturer has a staff of engineers working in its racing division — 
located in or near Detroit — in order to make its brand more competitive on 
the track. The engineers work on developing better aerodynamics, engines, 
and engine parts, and they also work with their respective race teams to try 
to get an advantage over the other car makes. But, as I talk about in Chapter 
6, NASCAR officials try to keep that from happening because their goal is for 
every car to have an equal chance of winning so that fans aren’t bored by the 
same car and the same driver winning each race.
 
The race car versions of the Dodge Charger, Ford Fusion, Chevrolet Impala, 
and Toyota Camry look quite similar to each other, so it’s not easy to tell one 
car from another if you’re not familiar with racing. That’s why manufacturers 
slap the name of the car on every vehicle. For example, the Chevrolets have 
a big decal with the word “Impala” on the nose of the car, Fords splash a big 
“Fusion” in the same spot, the Dodges have a “Charger,” and the Toyotas have 
a “Camry” decal where everybody can see it. When in doubt, check the front 
of the car to know which model is which.

57
 Chapter 5: Not Your Typical Family Sedan
Taking Stock of a Stock Car
Not much of a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car is similar to a passenger car. 
Stock cars are built for speed and safety, not to take the kids to soccer prac-
tice, so they don’t have cup holders or vanity mirrors, and none have an 
automatic transmission. Performance, not comfort or convenience, is what 
counts — which explains why stock cars last an average of three years, 
unlike passenger cars, which are manufactured for longevity.
The following are some things that you’re used to seeing on a passenger car 
but won’t find on a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car:
 
✓ Doors: That’s why drivers climb through the window opening to get in.
 
✓ Windows: There’s just a window-shaped opening covered with safety 
netting to prevent the driver’s head and arms from going outside the car 
during a crash. On the passenger’s side, teams install a plastic window 
that doesn’t roll down, but only for tracks 11/2 miles or longer. On tracks 
shorter than that, there’s nothing covering the window opening.
 
✓ A glass windshield: In race cars, the windshield is in three sections 
instead of just one, and it’s made of Lexan, which is hard, shatterproof 
plastic.
 
✓ Back seats or passenger seats: There’s just one seat: the driver’s seat.
 
✓ Brake lights or headlights: The lights you see on the race car aren’t 
real — they’re decals.
Manufacturer loyalty
While some fans cheer for a particular driver 
or team, others have an allegiance to a spe-
cific car manufacturer. For example, if your 
grandfather drove a Chevy his whole life and 
your dad drove a Chevy his entire life, you may 
be persuaded to root for Chevys on race day. 
It’s that kind of loyalty that car manufacturers 
love — and it’s that kind of loyalty that keeps 
them in racing.
A NASCAR sponsorship is a powerful way for 
manufacturers to connect with Americans look-
ing to buy cars and trucks. After all, racing is the 
only sport that uses the products of these com-
panies as the medium of competition, making 
competing on the track a natural extension of 
competing in the marketplace. NASCAR fans are 
nearly three times as likely as non-fans to think 
auto manufacturers that complete in NASCAR 
are better than auto manufacturers that do not 
compete in NASCAR, according to independent 
research. Studies done by the manufacturers 
have shown that the relationships between 
their companies and NASCAR have been ben-
eficial for both parties. For instance, Dodge 
says NASCAR fans have a 50 percent greater 
consideration of Dodge than non-fans, and 52 
percent of Ford owners call themselves “race 
fans.” Purchase consideration for Ford prod-
ucts is 47 percent higher among race fans than 
non-fans, according to the company.

58
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
 
✓ A speedometer: Drivers judge their speed using the tachometer, which 
shows the rpm (revolutions per minute) of the car. That makes figuring 
out pit road speed a little more difficult. (See Chapter 11 for an explana-
tion of why pit road speed matters.)
 
✓ A gas gauge: Engineers are constantly crunching numbers during races 
to determine how many miles per gallon or how many laps a race car 
can get on one can of gas. Cars are equipped with fuel pressure gauges 
but not gas gauges. When the fuel pressure needle starts bouncing, 
that’s a good indication the car is about to run out of fuel.
 
✓ Storage space in the trunk
 
✓ A stereo system or speakers
 
✓ An air conditioning or heating system: The driver does have ways to 
stay cool, though. If you watch a NASCAR race, keep an eye out for when 
the broadcast uses the in-car camera. You’ll see a hose that’s attached 
to the top of the driver’s helmet. That hose is pumping cool air from the 
engine to the helmet. Even still, the cockpit is very hot.
 
✓ Automatic transmission
 
✓ Anti-lock brakes
 
✓ Cruise control
 
✓ A key ignition: Drivers just flip a switch to get the car going.
 
✓ Air bags
Show cars
If you want to see a race car up close, you don’t 
necessarily have to go to the race track. From 
time to time, you can see one at your local mall 
or grocery store. Teams have show cars that 
travel around the country so fans can get a 
taste of NASCAR without having to pay for race 
tickets. While the cars are just for show, they 
are real race cars that were taken out of com-
mission for being too old, suffering irreparable 
damage, or because they just weren’t suited to 
the driver.
The car has everything that a real race car 
has, including a working engine so the show-
car driver can demonstrate to fans how loud 
a NASCAR Sprint Cup car gets. The show-car 
driver, whose job is to drive the show car all 
over the country, brings the car to stores, fairs, 
and driver appearances. It doesn’t cost anything 
to check it out, so if you’re curious about race 
cars, these appearances are perfect opportuni-
ties to see one in person and get a good look.

Checking out the body
 
The body of a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car is only partly stock. The hood, the 
rear deck lid (or trunk lid, as it’s normally called), the roof, the front grille, and 
the bumper panels are similar to the ones on passenger cars because they’re 
obtained from the manufacturer, although they’re modified a bit per NASCAR’s 
specifications. Car builders make the rest of stock-car bodies from scratch. 
The few factory-made parts on NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars, however, make 
them recognizable as cousins of the Chargers, Fusions, Impalas, and Camrys 
that you see driving down the highway. It also helps that teams place decals of 
headlights on the cars to make them look similar to passenger cars.
Noting aerodynamic features
 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars each have a rear wing, which is a metal blade 
with end plates that runs the width of the car atop the back of its trunk (see 
Figure 5-2). The wing allows for the car to run in smoother air and promotes 
more passing in traffic. The rear wing angle can be adjusted from 0 to 16 
degrees, enabling teams to tune rear downforce levels to suit individual 
drivers and tracks. The end plates on each wing can also be adjusted, and 
combinations ranging from flat to curved can be created to allow for further 
fine-tuning at the track. (Flip to Chapter 14 to read more on aerodynamics.)
The NASCAR Nationwide Series car has a slightly different aerodynamic 
feature: the spoiler. The spoiler, also attached on the trunk, collects air as 
it flows over the vehicle, and the air forces the back end into the ground, 
making it more stable. You may see passenger cars with spoilers on them, 
but most of the time they’re for looks, not for aerodynamics. Spoilers need 
to be big enough and mounted at the right angle to help control airflow, and 
passenger cars generally never go fast enough for aerodynamics, or a spoiler, 
to make a significant difference.
The other aerodynamic aspect of the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car is the 
front splitter (refer to Figure 5-2). The splitter positions air below the front 
bumper and helps strike an aerodynamic balance with the rear wing.

Inspecting the engine
A NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car uses an 8-cylinder engine (see Figure 5-3), 
just as the most powerful, sportiest passenger cars do. Here are similarities 
between a NASCAR V8 race engine and a typical V8 passenger car engine:
 
✓ The number of cylinders
 
✓ The location of the spark plugs
 
✓ The number of intake ports
 
✓ The number of exhaust ports
The manufacturers provide teams with engine blocks that have an engine dis-
placement between 350 and 358 cubic inches. (Cubic inches are one way to 
measure the size of the engine.) A run-of-the-mill passenger car engine has an 
average of 150 to 200 cubic inches. In racing, the bigger the engine, the more 
horsepower it will produce.

The manufacturers also outfit the teams with certain performance parts built 
to withstand 500-mile races, high speeds, and other stresses. After teams get 
these parts, they start tweaking them to their liking — and that’s why not 
every engine produces the same amount of horsepower. Most produce about 
850 horsepower, much more than a passenger car, which averages about 
200. The rpm, or revolutions per minute, can approach 9,000 in a race engine, 
which would blow your passenger car’s engine to smithereens because its 
engine can’t rev over 5,000 rpm for long. (The rpm describes how many times 
the crankshaft turns. The crankshaft, which rotates the drive shaft that pro-
vides power to the wheels, is itself rotated by the up and down action of the 
eight pistons.)
With all that wear on NASCAR Sprint Cup engines, teams have to replace 
many of their parts after every race, including the pistons, valves, and 
springs — basically anything that may have been worn even slightly. That 
way, the team helps prevent the engine from breaking during the following 
event. It takes about two days of work to freshen up a used engine, even if 
nothing needs to be repaired, because team members must replace many 
parts and meticulously comb over the engine for potential wear or defects.
When a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car is going upwards of 180 mph, the 
engine can get extremely hot. To prevent overheating, an air intake opening 
is positioned under the front bumper. Air is filtered through this opening and 
helps cool the engine. If a piece of debris — like a hotdog wrapper — covers 
the intake, the car may overheat. If this happens, the driver may have to 
come into the pits to remove the debris.
Relying on carburetors
Unlike passenger cars, which have been switched to fuel-injected engines 
that get better mileage and have fewer emissions that harm the environment, 

62
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
NASCAR stock cars still use carburetors. A carburetor mixes air and fuel 
that pass into the engine’s cylinders for combustion, while in a fuel-injected 
engine, an electric pulse triggers the release of a specific amount of fuel, 
which is then sprayed into each cylinder for combustion. To put it simply, 
NASCAR teams can get more horsepower from an engine with a carburetor 
(shown in Figure 5-4) than with fuel injection.

While teams can fiddle with the engines to enhance their performance, they 
can’t do just anything that pops into their heads. NASCAR sets certain param-
eters for the equipment and makes sure teams follow the rules by policing 
engines during inspections (see Chapter 6 for more on rules). NASCAR officials 
have to approve all parts before teams use them to ensure that no one has an 
unfair advantage. NASCAR’s goal is to make races as close and exciting as pos-
sible, so no one with an engine made of spaceship parts gets to use it.
Building for strength and speed
In racing, people make their living building high-performance engines that 
produce a lot of horsepower but can also withstand the grueling conditions 
of a long race. If that engine builder is a good one, he’s bound to make a nice 
salary because good engines are vital to winning races.
 
An engine builder in NASCAR racing reinforces parts of the engine. For 
example, he adds material to the bearing — a metal part that protects the 
crankshaft (refer to Figure 5-4) and the connecting rods from overheating and 
friction — to help prevent the engine from breaking down during a race. Only 
steel crankshafts are allowed, although most have been lightened and bal-
anced for increased horsepower. Teams use other reinforced parts in a race 
engine — in fact, most parts are reinforced — including extra-strength valves, 
camshafts, connecting rods, and valve springs.
It takes an engine builder about seven working days to obtain parts, tweak 
those parts, and put together an entire engine. The cost of that completed 
engine is about $80,000. Some teams build their own engines, while others 

63
 Chapter 5: Not Your Typical Family Sedan
buy them from outside companies. Sometimes, teams even lease engines if 
they’re trying to qualify for an important race or racing in a marquee event, 
such as the Daytona 500. The price of a leased engine isn’t pocket change, 
though. It can range anywhere from $10,000 to $40,000 or even more — and 
you have to give the engine back when you’re done.
 
Engine builders and engine tuners, who work on the engine after it’s built to 
make it produce more horsepower, have turned high-tech along with every-
thing else in NASCAR racing. They use special machines called engine dyna-
mometers, commonly known as “dynos,” which test an engine’s performance 
and measure its horsepower. During these tests, team members may run an 
engine for several hours, mimicking a 500-mile race, just to see how the engine 
will hold up or wear under race conditions and how much horsepower it will 
produce over the course of a race. The information from the dynos is col-
lected and relayed by computers for team members to analyze the data. If the 
team finds problems, the engine builder or tuner can make repairs before the 
car hits the track.
 
Teams also use machines called chassis dynamometers to measure the amount 
of power translated from the wheels to the ground — see Figure 5-5. (This 
machine is different from an engine dynamometer, which only tests the 
engine when it’s not in the race car.) The entire race car gets hooked up and 
anchored down to this large gizmo that in many cases looks like a regular 
old, open car trailer. But two rotating drums spaced the same width apart 
as the rear wheels of the race car are built into the floor of the trailer, and 
the car’s rear tires are positioned on top of these drums. When the engine is 
fired up and power is applied to the rear wheels, they begin turning, and the 
drums begin turning as well. Of course, because the rear wheels are turning 
the drums, the car stays in place. The measurements from the rotation of the 
drums allow teams and NASCAR officials to analyze cars’ performance.

Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
Teams don’t build just one engine for a race and then hope it holds out for 
the duration of race weekend. Well-funded teams can have three engines 
just for qualifying: a primary, a backup, and a backup to the backup. If a race 
engine goes bad between qualifying and the start of a race, teams can make 
a substitution but must start from the rear of the field, regardless of their 
qualifying effort. After the race starts, teams can fix individual parts but can’t 
reinstall entire engines.
Fine-tuning the suspension
Perfecting the suspension — or the parts that affect the handling of a race 
car — is one of the most complex aspects of racing. The gist of making the 
suspension just right is figuring out how much force to put on each corner 
of the car. That determines how the car rides, how easily the driver is able 
to control the car, and how fast he can go through the turns. A car that has 
good balance among all four wheels handles better, allowing the driver to 
hit the brakes later going into the turns and mash the gas that much sooner 
coming out of the turns, which of course means he will go faster.
 
The suspension in passenger cars has springs and shocks that provide a 
smooth and comfortable ride at low speeds over a period of years, with few 
or no adjustments necessary. In race cars, however, a team makes constant 
changes to the suspension to improve the car’s performance. The key is get-
ting the right combination. NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars have independent 
suspension on the front only, meaning the front wheels act and react sepa-
rately from one another, while the back ones react the same to every bump, 
turn, or dip — see Figure 5-6 for a complete look. The adjustable parts of the 
suspension, as well as other elements that can affect the performance of the 
suspension, are some of the most important parts of a car’s setup, which is 
how the car is prepared to drive on the track with optimum handling and 
speed. Here’s a suspension primer:
 
✓ Air pressure: Changing the air pressure in the tires is the change most 
teams use as their first option to try to improve the setup of a car during 
a race. That’s because they can change the air pressure in the new tires 
before the pit stop, so they don’t lose any time making adjustments on 
pit road, which can add seconds to a pit stop, often causing a driver to 
lose positions. If the car needs more drastic changes because it still isn’t 
riding to a driver’s liking, teams can put different amounts of air pres-
sure in each of the tires, change the pressure of only one tire, or change 
a combination of tires. The amount of air pressure put in or taken out 
depends on where the driver has problems in the turn (at the entrance, 
in the center, or exiting the turn).

✓ Camber: Before the race, teams monitor tire wear and tire temperatures 
to see how the tire is performing on the track. If the tires are wearing out 
too much on one side, or are too hot on one side, teams will change the 
camber of the tires — changing the angle of each tire so it touches less 
or more of the racing surface. Camber is measured in degrees from verti-
cal. In addition, camber is adjusted on the front tires to assure they have 
a uniform temperature.
 
✓ Shock absorbers: Shock absorbers are cylinders attached to the car’s 
wheel that make the car ride more smoothly over bumps. They take 
care of the tire and control how fast the wheel moves up and down. The 
key is to figure out the optimum combination of a smooth ride and fast 
wheel speed. To do that, most teams hire specialized “shock engineers” 
whose sole job is to build and test shocks and devise ways to make them 
work better so their cars go faster.
 
 Teams even hook up the shock to a shock dynamometer (refer to Figure 
5-6), which pumps the shock up and down as if it were in a real car. The 
computer prints out results of the test, which show how much force 
is used when the shock compresses and extends. That’s how a team 
figures out the right shocks and how to adjust them for optimum perfor-
mance during qualifying or a race.
 
 At superspeedways — such as Daytona International Speedway and 
Talladega Superspeedway — shock technology went a bit far in recent 
years. Teams began to adjust the shocks so that they would depress 
once the car got on the track but would never rebound. This adjustment 
made the car lower to the ground and improved the aerodynamics, 
allowing the lower-slung car to cut through the air easier and faster. 
The problem is that the ride was too bumpy and nearly uncontrollable 
for drivers — a particular danger at superspeedways. Drivers said the 
ride was so jarring, it felt like the fillings were going to come out of their 
teeth. But they were, and are, willing to endure just about any discom-
fort if it means another couple of horsepower or a couple of hundredths 
of a second off the stopwatch. NASCAR decided to use a uniform shock 
for those race tracks. Teams pick up four shocks with equal specifica-
tions on qualifying day and race day at the superspeedways.
 
✓ Springs: Teams have a closetful of springs. The tension on each spring, 
which is the spring rate, determines how smooth the ride will be and 
how much weight is put on each tire. Some springs compress more 
easily than others. The key is to get the right spring with the optimum 
spring rate in the proper corner of the car. What makes it even more 
difficult is that you can put different springs in all four wheels. Teams 
can’t change springs during a race, but they can insert a rubber block 
(cleverly called a rubber) between two coils of the spring to increase the 
tension or take it out to decrease tension. That makes the handling of 
the car looser or tighter, depending on which spring (and which wheel) 
the rubber goes into.

67
 Chapter 5: Not Your Typical Family Sedan
 
 If a car’s suspension is loose, the rear tires don’t provide enough trac-
tion, making the rear of the car fishtail when a driver goes through a 
turn. The driver feels as if he’s losing control of the car and is about to 
spin out. This is also called oversteer. A tight suspension is the opposite: 
When a driver goes through the corners, the front of the car doesn’t 
turn well because the front tires are losing traction before the rear tires 
are. When a car is tight, it also means it’s pushing — and if a driver isn’t 
careful, he’ll end up zooming right into the wall.
 
✓ Track bar: The track bar is a part of the rear suspension that’s attached 
to the frame on one side and to the rear axle on the other. It keeps the 
tires centered within the car. Without the track bar, the frame of the 
car would sway from side to side, making the car unstable and difficult 
to drive. Teams can raise or lower the track bar by inserting a wrench 
into a hole located above the right rear tire, and this adjustment makes 
the car easier to control at high speeds. The track bar is also called a 
Panhard bar.
 
✓ Sway bar: Most race cars have two sway bars — one in the front and 
one in the rear — which alter the amount a car rolls to one side or the 
other through the turns. The front sway bar is always used; the rear 
sway bar isn’t used at some tracks. The front sway bar is attached to the 
frame and the lower control arms of the suspension. During practice, 
teams change sway bars to change how much weight is transferring to 
the springs on each corner of the car. Teams can’t make adjustments 
to the sway bar during a race, so they’re stuck with what they put in 
before the event. At times, though, teams will disconnect the rear sway 
bar — which is connected to the frame and the rear-end housing — and 
remove it all together.
 
✓ Wedge: Putting wedge in means putting more weight onto a wheel by 
compressing the spring. Teams can put wedge into the rear wheels 
during a race by inserting a long socket wrench into a hole above the 
tires. Putting a half round of wedge in means they are turning the wrench 
in a half circle — and placing that much more pressure on the spring. 
Taking two rounds of wedge out means turning the wrench twice coun-
terclockwise and loosening the spring. A round of wedge is also called a 
round of bite.
Noticing other differences
Here are some other features that make a NASCAR stock car different from a 
passenger car:
 
✓ The steering wheel is detachable, making it easier for the driver to enter 
and exit the car (see Figure 5-7).

ing wheel

✓ The car has roof flaps (rectangular pieces of metal) that pop up when 
the car travels backwards. When a car spins at a superspeedway, the 
aerodynamics change in a potentially dangerous way. The air is not 
being displaced by the front air dam but is now rushing under the sides 
of the car and over the top in a way that causes a car to fly up into the 
air for a second or two. The roof flap, when it pops open, disrupts the 
airflow pattern over the roof so all four wheels of the car stay on the 
ground. See Chapter 12 for more on roof flaps. The roof also has an 
escape hatch, which allows the driver to pop through the roof of the car 
if the driver’s side window doesn’t allow an exit. The roof hatch, intro-
duced in 2003, is not a mandatory installation.
 
✓ The gas tank — called a fuel cell — is located below the trunk and is far-
ther to the rear than in passenger cars (see Figure 5-8). It’s made of steel 
with an internal rubber bladder that’s much stronger and more durable 
than a passenger car’s gas tank.

✓ The trunk and the hood are fastened down with several steel pins, which 
allows for quick and easy access but secure attachment as well. Also, 
steel safety cables are attached between the frame and both the hood 
and trunk lid to keep them from flying off in an accident.
 
✓ An internal roll cage, made of tubular steel (see Figure 5-9), is a basic 
and primary safety feature that protects drivers during crashes.

✓ The exhaust doesn’t exit from pipes at the rear of the car. It exits on the 
right side of the car, opposite the driver, near the rear tires (refer to 
Figure 5-9). The exhaust used to exit on the left side of the car, under-
neath the driver’s seat, but this made the car unbearably hot.
Climbing Inside
If you peer inside a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car, you won’t find luxurious, 
finely upholstered leather seats, a radio, or a clock. It’s as austere as possi-
ble, made for utility and function, not style or convenience. Figure 5-10 gives 
you a peek inside.
 
The gauges on the dashboard are a perfect example. You won’t find a speed-
ometer to see how fast you’re going or an odometer to see how far you’ve 
traveled. All cars, however, have a tachometer that measures the number of 
revolutions per minute (rpm) of the engine. It indicates how hard the engine is 
working.

Gauges
The gauges in a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car vary from car to car, depend-
ing on what the driver is used to, but some of the gauges — in addition to the 
tachometer — include the following:
 
✓ Oil temperature
 
✓ Water temperature
 
✓ Oil pressure
 
✓ Volt gauge to monitor the battery and electrical system
 
✓ Fuel pressure gauge
Next to those gauges you find a few switches, which always include an igni-
tion switch. That’s why drivers don’t need keys to start their cars; they just 
flip the switch, and the engine roars. There also is a second ignition switch 
that controls a second ignition box. Sometimes in a race, you see a car drop 
way back for no apparent reason and just as suddenly recover and start 
moving toward the front again. That’s an indication that the car may have 
stalled because of ignition failure and that the driver has switched to the 
back-up ignition to remedy the problem.
Next to the ignition switches are switches that turn on the driver’s cooling 
system, which sends air into the driver’s helmet and suit. Also, you may find 

71
 Chapter 5: Not Your Typical Family Sedan
a brake fan that blows air on the front brakes to keep them cool and working 
properly. (Cars used at short tracks — where braking occurs constantly — 
have rear brakes only, so the extra fans are in the rear in those cars.) A car 
may also have a rear-end fan to keep the grease cool so the rear-end gear 
doesn’t burn up.
If you look at the pedals on the floor of the driver’s seat, you notice a brake 
pedal, a gas pedal, and a clutch pedal. In a passenger car, you use your right 
foot to control the gas and brake pedals and your left foot to control the 
clutch. In racing, it doesn’t necessarily work that way. Most drivers use their 
right to hit the gas and their left to hit the brake and the clutch. Those who 
use this two-foot method, including me, believe it is a faster and more effi-
cient way to get on and off the gas and brake.
Taking a Seat
A stock car has only one seat, and that’s for the driver. And it certainly isn’t 
very comfortable to sit in (see Figure 5-11). A seat is made of aluminum or 
titanium, covered with padding, and custom-fitted to a driver’s body. Even 
though a driver may spend four hours in that seat during a race, it can’t be 
too comfortable because that would mean it isn’t safe enough. The seat must 
be snug so there’s no room to move around, which keeps a driver safer in 
case of an accident. To protect a driver’s ribs, two extensions jut from each 
side, so that drivers have to wiggle into their seats instead of just sliding 
in. The seat also has extensions to protect a driver’s legs, head, and neck. 
But not all seats are exactly the same. Most are custom-built to the specific 
driver. This adds to the safety and gives the driver at least a little bit more 
comfort. Head and neck restraints also are mandatory. And no, the seat 
doesn’t recline so the driver can relax when a caution flag slows traffic.

Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
Riding on Treadless Tires
NASCAR uses high-performance Goodyear tires that don’t look much like the 
ones you use on your family car. And they certainly cost much more than 
what you’d pay for the ones on your family car. (What do teams pay for these 
upscale beauties? Roughly $350 to $400 per tire.) NASCAR tires are wider 
than passenger-car tires: The part that actually touches the ground is about 
11 inches wide (see Figure 5-12). They are treadless so that the cars get as 
much traction as possible — the more rubber that touches the racing sur-
face, the better.
 
Figure 5-12: 
NASCAR 
race tires 
are wider 
than 
passenger-
car tires 
and have no 
tread.

Passenger-car tire
 
Goodyear employees come to every race and prepare the tires for the teams, 
including balancing and mounting each tire onto its wheel. Each team has its 
own set of wheels at each race, sometimes color-coordinated with the car’s 
paint scheme, which a separate company transports to and from each race 
track. Having a separate company deal with the wheels makes it easier for 
teams because it frees up room on their haulers (see Chapter 7 for more on 
the race team members) for other equipment. It also allows the Goodyear tire-
busters, who mount and balance the tires, to start mounting tires even before 
the teams unload their equipment.
On a typical race weekend, NASCAR teams use between 9 and 14 sets of tires, 
depending on the length of the track. At four tires per set, with 43 cars on 

73
 Chapter 5: Not Your Typical Family Sedan
the track, that means the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series uses up more than 1,000 
tires in a single race, and sometimes more than 2,000. By comparison, an 
average set of street car tires is replaced approximately every three years. 
Goodyear uses 18 different tire codes to cover the needs of NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series teams, providing tires with softer or harder compounds to match 
the tire-wear tendencies of each speedway.
Touching on Technology
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars are supposed to be simple, not high-tech. 
They aren’t outfitted with onboard sensors the way Formula One cars are. 
NASCAR officials make sure cars stay that way by checking the car before 
every race for computerized items, including the following outlawed 
instruments:
 
✓ Onboard computers
 
✓ Recording devices
 
✓ Electronic memory chips
 
✓ Traction control devices
 
✓ Digital gauges
 
In certain cases, though, cars are outfitted with sensors — called telemetry — 
at the request of the network broadcasting the race. The sensors are placed 
throughout the car to monitor the rpm (revolutions per minute), mph (miles 
per hour), when and how often the brake and gas pedals are pressed, and 
which gear the driver selected (with the stick shift). Some networks broadcast 
that information during the race to show in graphic detail the performance 
characteristics of a certain car. This telemetry is usually used in conjunction 
with in-car camera shots broadcast from that car.
 
Also, every team has an electronic transmitter called a transponder on its car 
during a race. The transponder, shown in Figure 5-13, is a transmitter that 
a team affixes to the bottom of its car — on the right side of the box that 
protects the fuel cell — to monitor lap times around a track. Every time the 
transponder hits a certain point on the track — known as a scoring loop — it 
records the lap time on a remote computer. Teams huddle around a computer 
during qualifying to see lap times pop up and who is qualifying where. Also, 
during a race, those times register on a computer in the pits, so that teams 
can figure out how fast their cars are going relative to the other cars on the 
track. In 2005, transponders also played a new role: gathering statistics called 
Loop Data, which I explain in Chapter 16.

W
hen sitting in the grandstands at a NASCAR race for the first time, you 
may have trouble making sense of what the heck is going on. With 
your binoculars, you can probably see a lot of activity in the garage area, and 
with your own eyes, you can see what’s happening out on the track — but 
you may not have any idea what to make of it. Don’t fret. This chapter gives 
you the lowdown so you don’t feel so lost.
Living by the Rule Book
At the beginning of each year, NASCAR officials hand out rule books to every 
driver, crew member, car owner, and anyone else with a NASCAR license. 
They don’t give tests on the material, but they do have a clever, effective 
way to find out whether the racing teams know and follow the rules: NASCAR 
officials inspect each car several times during a race weekend, checking to 
see that teams follow the regulations. Inspecting the cars isn’t an easy task, 
considering there are so many regulations by which to abide.
Having a rule for everything
The rule book is crammed with pages of specifications, mandates, and “sug-
gestions.” These rules give teams details of how to do almost everything they 
need to compete, including how to build a car to NASCAR specifications, 
what safety measures to implement, and how to fill out paperwork such as 
entry blanks for races. Some of the other rules deal with the following issues:

76
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
 
✓ Engine: A team can’t have just any engine in its car. The engine has to 
be a certain size and must be set up in a certain way, so cancel your call 
to those NASA engineers for their rocket science advice.
 
✓ Body: Even though NASCAR car bodies are hand-crafted in a race shop, 
NASCAR still enforces rules on the basic shape of each vehicle. That 
means a team can’t have a Ford Fusion body that looks like one of those 
rocket-type cars on The Jetsons.
 
✓ Tires: NASCAR tries to contain costs for car owners, so it has specific 
rules about how many sets of tires a team can use for qualifying and 
practice.
 
✓ Gas tank: Many times, races may come down to which team gets better 
fuel mileage (meaning which team can make it farther on a single tank of 
gas), so NASCAR makes sure to check that the fuel cell — the fancy word 
for gas tank — isn’t bigger than it’s supposed to be.
 
✓ Pit stops: When a car comes in for tires or fuel during the race, the 
team’s pit crew jumps over the pit wall to service the vehicle. But that 
group can’t just do whatever it wants. NASCAR specifies how many 
people can go “over the wall” to work on a car during a race and has 
certain rules for how the team should conduct the stop. For more on pit 
stops and the rules that govern them, see Chapter 11.
While NASCAR has many guidelines for building and preparing a race car 
for competition, it doesn’t have specific rules that govern how drivers race 
against each other. However, NASCAR does reserve the right to penalize driv-
ers for rough driving, such as bumping into the back of another car to pass it 
or causing a car to crash when an accident could have been avoided.
Drivers have unspoken rules among themselves, sometimes called gentle-
men’s agreements, about how aggressive you should be on the track. Not 
everybody follows those rules; it depends on the driver. Some drivers are 
known to race like bullies, knocking cars out of the way to pass them. But 
those who do that are fair game in future races. As the saying goes, “What 
goes around, comes around.”
NASCAR’s rule book is packed with so many regulations regarding the race 
car that you’d be hard pressed to come up with something that it doesn’t 
have a regulation for. Every crew member has a NASCAR rule book for the 
series he or she is involved in.
Covering the rules at the drivers’ meeting
 
NASCAR teams and drivers really don’t have to sit down with the rule book 
and study it from cover to cover. They have a pretty good idea of what’s 
inside from starting out on local tracks and making their way through the 
ranks. If any specific rule changes are made for on-track activity — such as 

77
 Chapter 6: The Rules of the Road
making a pit stop in a very small pit box (the area a driver must pull into so 
that the crew can service the car) or starting the race on a restart at a particu-
lar point on the track — NASCAR officials review those changes during the 
drivers’ meeting. That meeting is normally held two hours before the event, 
and it’s the one time during a race weekend when all the drivers and crew 
chiefs are in the same place at the same time.
Even the drivers’ meetings have rules. Drivers and their crew chiefs must 
attend the meeting — and be on time — or they’re penalized. If a driver or his 
crew chief misses the meeting, the driver automatically starts the race from 
the last-place spot, no matter where he qualified. This can be embarrassing 
for a driver who qualified third but overslept, missed the meeting, and had 
to start the race in last place. His team gets upset because all the work it put 
in to qualify up front goes to waste. The sponsors aren’t too happy about the 
driver falling back to last place in the field either. Companies don’t pay hun-
dreds of thousands — sometimes millions — of dollars to see their cars start 
last. But really, it’s a very rare occurrence for a driver or a crew chief to miss 
the drivers’ meeting.
Even though drivers know the rules, they occasionally may ask questions 
at the drivers’ meeting in order to clarify an issue. For example, if a driver 
isn’t sure where to start accelerating when the green flag falls (signaling the 
start or restart of the race), he asks a NASCAR official to go over that point. 
Or sometimes a driver uses the drivers’ meeting as a chance to speak up 
about something that has been bothering him. If practice before the race was 
particularly out of control, a driver may warn his fellow competitors that the 
race isn’t necessarily won by who goes the fastest — it’s won by who goes 
the fastest without getting into an accident. NASCAR officials warn the com-
petitors, too. Often at the drivers’ meeting, NASCAR officials tell the drivers, 
“You can’t finish first unless you finish.”
 
Many times, the drivers’ meeting is held in an empty bay in the garage area, 
where chairs are set up for the drivers and crew chiefs. Sometimes, when 
there is enough room, fans are allowed to watch — but only from outside of 
roped-off areas. If you have a garage pass, get to the area early because many 
fans show up to see the proceedings. This is a great time to take a peek at 
your favorite drivers and snap their pictures while they relax and interact 
with other drivers. Don’t make noise, though, because NASCAR officials can 
throw you out of the meeting area. You don’t want to storm the drivers and 
crew chiefs for autographs as they leave the meeting either. That’s one way to 
upset them, particularly because they don’t have that much time to prepare 
for the race. They’re trying to focus on the competition, not on the T-shirt you 
want them to autograph.

Passing Those Picky Inspections
Long before drivers go to drivers’ meetings or teams put the final touches on 
their cars, NASCAR officials have to approve their cars to race. Throughout 
race weekend, NASCAR officials inspect cars to see whether teams are abid-
ing by the rules. If the cars pass inspection, officials give teams permission 
for their cars to go on the track by placing a small sticker on the windshield. 
If they don’t, teams must work on the cars until officials deem them ready 
to race.
A race weekend in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, the NASCAR Nationwide 
Series, and the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series usually begins on 
Friday, and inspections begin not long after the garage opens that morning. 
Teams arrive at the garage early and start preparing their cars for NASCAR 
inspectors to examine. If a car doesn’t pass inspection the first time through, 
team members know right away that the weekend won’t be an easy one.
In this section, I give you the ins and outs of the entire inspection process.
Surviving the initial inspection
The initial inspection begins the morning the track opens, when each car is 
put on four stands without its tires. Inspectors check the following:
 
✓ Body: Even though NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing involves only 
Fords, Chevrolets, Dodges, and Toyotas, there’s a lot of room for tweak-
ing. So officials must make sure that each of the cars conforms to a 
certain shape — no missiles or bullet trains allowed. Officials inspect 
the shapes of the various makes by using templates (see Figure 6-1), 
which are form-fitting aluminum sheets that are lowered on various 
parts of the car body, such as the doors or the hood and roofline. These 
templates are part of a large structure contained in the inspection sta-
tion. Each car must enter the station and must legally fit each template 
in order to pass inspection. If there’s a significant gap between the car 
body and the template, the inspectors won’t approve the car to go onto 
the track until the fabricators reshape the body to make it fit.
 
✓ Safety belts and nets: An inspector takes a quick look around the inside 
to make sure all the safety features are in order, especially the seatbelts 
and the window net. The seatbelts strap the driver in with five adjoining 
belts, while the window net is a piece of mesh fastened to the inside of 
the window to keep the driver’s head or arms from coming out of the 
window during an accident. To make sure these items work, the inspec-
tor checks whether they’re made of the correct material, that they’re 
properly attached to the car, and that their locking mechanisms are 
functioning.

tion station

✓ Roll bars: If a driver rolls his car over, the roll bars are designed to pro-
tect the roof from caving in and crushing him. Roll bars extend down the 
sides of the cars and help protect drivers in collisions with other cars. 
An inspector checks these bars with a special instrument to make sure 
the diameter and thickness of the steel tubing is correct.
 
✓ Fuel cell (or gas tank): Officials check the fuel cell to make sure it holds 
the correct amount of fuel (17.75 gallons) and that it has a foam rubber 
interior to prevent it from breaking open and spilling gasoline. The 
inspector also takes a look at the check-valve, which prevents fuel spills 
if the car turns over.
 
✓ Engine volume and compression ratio: Even though the engine is 
checked more thoroughly in subsequent inspections, officials like to give 
it a once-over during the initial inspection. They check to see whether 
the engine is the right size and whether the compression ratio is correct. 
Bigger engines (with more volume) produce more horsepower. Higher 
compression ratios produce more power, too.
 
✓ Metal check: To ensure teams aren’t cheating by substituting a lighter 
material, such as titanium, for steel (to make their car lighter and 
faster), inspectors go over the main parts of the car with a magnet. If the 
magnet doesn’t stick, they’ve caught a team trying to break the rules.
If officials catch teams cheating or see something they don’t like in this initial 
inspection, they can ask teams to fix or replace the part or parts in question. 
If NASCAR gives them an initial okay, the team’s next step is to head for a 
more thorough inspection.

80
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
Heading to the inspection line
 
Even though a team may have gotten through the initial inspection, inspec-
tions aren’t done for the day. Before qualifying, each team must take the 
car through a technical inspection line where several officials look at it. Cars 
go through tech, which is NASCAR lingo for technical inspection, at the follow-
ing times:
 
✓ Before the first practice of the race weekend.
 
✓ Before qualifying.
 
✓ After qualifying if they win the pole.
 
✓ Just before the race, which is why you may see a line of cars snaking 
through the garage the morning of race day, with crew members shep-
herding their cars through the line.
In the inspection line, officials conduct a more thorough check of the cars. If 
a car fails just one part of the multi-step inspection, the team has to roll the 
car back to the garage and fix the item in question. Then the team must roll 
the car through the inspection line again, whether it cuts into practice time 
or not. When the team gets to the front of the line, officials don’t only check 
the item that didn’t pass the initial inspection — they inspect every part of 
the car all over again. That’s just to make sure the team didn’t fiddle with 
anything when it went back to the garage area. If the car passes the inspec-
tion, officials put a sticker on the car’s windshield indicating it can go out on 
the track.
For some teams, inspections continue after the race ends. Certain cars, 
including the winner’s, must be inspected one more time before teams pack 
up and go home. Check out the “Even when a car wins, it’s not over” section 
later in this chapter for more on post-race inspections.
In the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, inspection officials review the following:
 
✓ Weight: Crew members push their car through the inspection line with 
the car’s engine off. In order to be weighed, the car must go through 
inspection wet, which means filled with fuel, oil, and water. Without the 
driver, NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars must weigh at least 3,450 pounds, 
with at least 1,700 pounds of that weight on the right side.
 
✓ Height: As the car rolls on the scales, it also rolls under an arch of metal 
with a pin attached to its center. That pin reaches down to the car’s 
roof, measuring the roof height of the vehicle. NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
cars must be a minimum of 53.5 inches.
 
✓ Ground clearance: Teams want their cars to be as low to the ground as 
possible (without scraping the ground, of course) so that their cars can 
cut through the air easily. But NASCAR wants to make sure those cars 
aren’t too low. Officials measure the ground clearance at various points 

81
 Chapter 6: The Rules of the Road
on the vehicle, ensuring teams aren’t trying to get their cars to squat 
lower than the rules allow in order to get an unfair advantage.
 
✓ Compression ratio and engine displacement: Inspectors use instruments 
to ensure the compression ratio is 12:1. With higher ratios, engines pro-
duce more power. Inspectors also do a check for the overall engine dis-
placement, which reveals the volume of the engine. NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series engines must be a maximum of 358 cubic inches. Any bigger, and 
those engines would generate more horsepower. Inspectors also check 
one of the engine’s eight cylinders each week — a different cylinder every 
time — to keep teams on their toes and make sure no one is cheating.
 
✓ Safety: As with the initial check, NASCAR officials examine the inside 
of the car, looking for sharp edges on which a driver could get injured. 
They also check the safety belts and window nets for wear and tear.
 
✓ Rear wing: The rear wing is a piece of metal that runs the width of the 
car and is attached to the car’s trunk. It provides better balance and 
better controls in traffic, allows for the car to run in smoother air, and 
promotes more passing in traffic. It also improves the side force of the 
car and can be adjusted at the race track. Officials check the angle of the 
wing, which can vary from 0 to 16 degrees.
 
✓ Templates: As I mention in the previous section, templates — pieces of 
metal that conform to the body of a car — ensure the car fits NASCAR 
specifications (see Figure 6-2). Each piece conforms to the car in differ-
ent places — including the nose, the length of the body, and the width of 
the body — making it a metal blueprint for the shape of a car’s exterior.

Driving fast, but not so fast
Think a team is off the hook just because its car passed through tech before 
it went on the track for practice? Not yet. NASCAR officials want to make sure 
teams aren’t cheating, so they make cars go through tech inspection several 
other times during a race weekend, including just before qualifying (see 
Chapter 9 for more on qualifying). Afterward, they have to take their place in 
line on pit road to wait for qualifying to begin — so there’s no chance to go 
back to the garage and tweak a little bit. When qualifying is over, the top five 
qualifiers go through inspection again, where officials check height, weight, 
and the car’s body.
S
 
Even though NASCAR officials do a great job inspecting cars, teams stand-
ing in line waiting for inspection also police each other. If something on a car 
looks funny, other teams are often the first to protest, and NASCAR doesn’t 
mind. Other race car drivers are NASCAR’s second defense against rule 
breakers, and the intensity of the competition between the teams helps 
keep racing fair.
Conducting special tests for special tracks
NASCAR officials use an especially thorough process to inspect cars at 
Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway, the sport’s 
biggest tracks (see Chapter 14). Officials conduct special tests at these 
tracks to ensure driver and fan safety because of the high speeds that cars 
run there — upwards of 180 mph.
At Daytona and Talladega, where carburetor restrictor plates are required 
to reduce horsepower and slow cars down, an official handles the restric-
tor plates at all times. (See Chapter 14 for more on restrictor plates.) Teams 
receive their restrictor plates when they go through inspection, but they 
can’t just grab one and slap it on their car’s carburetor; it’s a carefully regu-
lated process. A team member reaches over a barrier to choose a plate ran-
domly; then an official lifts the plate over his head for everyone to see. After 
that, the official places the restrictor plate on a pole that measures the diam-
eter of the opening, ensuring it’s the same size as everyone else’s restrictor 
plate. Finally, he places the plate on the car’s engine; see Figure 6-3. Then the 
engine is sealed with an official NASCAR seal to make sure none of the teams 
tamper with the engine after it passes inspection.

NASCAR officials take the inspection process at superspeedways farther than 
at other tracks. They often X-ray parts of a car’s engine after the race, nearly 
eliminating the chance of a team getting away with even the smallest infrac-
tion. If there are holes in the carburetor, even ones the naked eye can’t see, 
more air leaks into the engine — and the car goes faster, defeating the pur-
pose of the restrictor plates. NASCAR ensures that no holes exist.
Even when a car wins, it’s not over
Even after the cars cross the finish line and the winner drives into Victory 
Lane, the inspection process isn’t over. In fact, the hardest part is yet to 
come. After a driver wins a race, officials follow his car into Victory Lane and 
watch over it — just to make sure his team doesn’t tamper with it while he 
poses for pictures or sprays champagne over the crowd. After the driver and 
his team are done whooping it up, the team rolls the car to the gas pumps to 
fill the fuel cell. The other cars that finished in the top five have already filled 
up their fuel cells. Then the top five cars go through inspection again, during 
which NASCAR officials weigh them — which is why they need to fill their gas 
tanks — and place templates on the bodies one last time.

84
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
The battery of inspections continues: The top two or three cars — depending 
on how many NASCAR officials choose — head for an empty garage to be 
inspected again. Another car, chosen randomly, also gets the privilege of join-
ing them. (The first driver who falls out of the race because of an accident or 
mechanical failure picks a number out of a hat. Whichever car finishes in that 
place becomes the random car to be torn down.) Having a random car torn 
down is the way NASCAR officials can police cars that consistently finish out 
of the top five.
 
Unlike other inspections during the weekend, post-race inspections can take 
several hours because the teams have to do a thorough tear-down, taking apart 
the engine, the suspension, the power train, and whatever else officials want 
to check out. Officials check not only for obviously illegal parts, but also for 
parts not approved by NASCAR (which may have been modified in hidden 
places) and illegal additives used in the fuel. Those things may appear legal at 
first glance.
Here’s a quick post-race inspection list:
 
✓ Engine: size, compression and so on
 
✓ Ignition
 
✓ Rear-end gear
 
✓ Fuel tank
 
✓ Body
 
✓ Power train
 
✓ Fuel (fuel additives)
While teams are happy to win races, they aren’t so thrilled about their post-
celebration work at tear-downs. At that point, they’ve had a long day, often 
beginning before dawn, and want to go home. When NASCAR officials finally 
give a team the okay, team members place all the car’s engine parts into a 
box to be shipped back in the team truck. The team must put the engine back 
together at another time. That used to not pose that much of a problem — 
teams had to build many cars for many different types of tracks. But that’s 
changed a bit. The new NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car can be used at many 
different tracks. For instance, teams now can use the same car at Talladega 
Superspeedway that they would use at the Watkins Glen International road 
course.

85
 Chapter 6: The Rules of the Road
Being Creative with the Rules
 
NASCAR racing has become so competitive — with so much money at stake — 
that teams do everything possible to get an edge on the competition. Getting 
around the rules has lots of names, such as interpreting the rules, reading 
between the lines, using the gray area, and being creative. Bending the rules is a 
fact of life in NASCAR, so much so that it led to a pretty famous racing motto: 
“If you ain’t cheatin’, you ain’t tryin’.”
Here are some of the ways teams try to skirt the rules:
 
✓ Body: Teams can get an aerodynamic advantage by putting all sorts of 
nearly indistinguishable bumps and ruts into a car’s body.
 
✓ Tires: Teams have soaked or chemically treated the tires to make them 
softer to get a better grip on the track — which does make the car faster, 
but only for short runs because the soaked or altered tires aren’t very 
durable. If NASCAR officials think a team may be treating tires, they 
confiscate the tires for careful inspection, which in the past has even 
included shipping the tires off for a detailed chemical analysis by an 
independent laboratory.
 
✓ Engine: Teams try to lower the motor mounts, where the motor sits in 
relation to the body of the car, so that the car has a lower center of grav-
ity and handles better.
 
✓ Wheel hubs or other parts: To lighten the car, teams try to figure out 
how to make parts out of lighter material — which is illegal in certain 
cases where parts must be made out of NASCAR-mandated materials, 
such as steel. Still, teams are constantly substituting those materials for 
lighter ones when they install drive shafts, wheel hubs, suspension com-
ponents, or even nuts or bolts on the engine. They can also drill holes 
in these parts, another way to make the car lighter. Teams transfer the 
weight they save to a spot lower on the car to improve handling.
 
While figuring out ways to bend rules can be a creative process, if a team is 
caught cheating, NASCAR is pretty tough. If officials discover something illegal 
on a car after qualifying but before the race, they make the crew fix or replace 
the part, and they later slap the team with a big fine or put the crew chief on 
probation, or both. Being on probation means that if a team member is caught 
doing anything illegal again, he can be temporarily or permanently kicked out 
of the garage. If NASCAR officials discover an illegal part on a car after the 
race, they usually fine the driver or take points away from him. Some penal-
ties are so severe that it could mean the end of championship hopes. In 2008, 
Martin Truex, Jr.’s team was fined $100,000, the crew chief was suspended for 
six races, and Truex and his owner were both docked 150 points for having an 
illegal car. That was pretty much the end of any hopes Truex had of making 
the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup.

86
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
NASCAR inspections have become so thorough that the amount of cheating 
going on in NASCAR garages is a fraction of what it was 20 or 30 years ago.
Watching the Flagman
After all the inspections, cars are ready to get out on the track. From that 
point on, keep your eye on the flagman, who is perched above the race track 
at the start/finish line in a crow’s nest of sorts (see Figure 6-4).

caution.

If you’re not sure what all those flags he’s waving around are, here’s the low-
down:
 
✓ Green: To keep things simple, green means go. The flagman waves the 
green flag to signal the start of the race. During the pace laps, which are 
run at a slower pace so that cars can warm up their engines and tires, a 
pace car with flashing yellow lights on its roof leads the field. Just before 
the race starts, the pace car peels off onto pit road as the flagman waves 
the green flag. Then, they’re off!
 
✓ Yellow: The yellow flag, or caution flag, comes out when drivers need to 
slow down because the track is unsafe. This happens in the event of an 
accident, rain, or when debris or oil is on the track. When the yellow flag 
is waved, drivers can’t race or pass each other. The position of each car 
in the field is frozen at the moment when the yellow flag flew. Until late 

87
 Chapter 6: The Rules of the Road
2003, drivers were allowed to “race back to the yellow” because the cau-
tion period didn’t formally begin until the leader crossed the start/finish 
line. Often, a driver with a big lead would slow his car on the way to the 
line to allow lapped cars to make up a lap. To compensate for the elimi-
nation of this tactic, NASCAR instituted a new rule that allows the first 
car one lap down to pass the pace car and make up his lost lap. This 
rule became unofficially known as the Lucky Dog Rule (though officially, 
NASCAR calls it the beneficiary rule).
 
 Drivers don’t always feel the same way when a caution comes out. 
Sometimes, they are happy about it because they need a pit stop for gas 
or fresh tires, or because the car in the lead is a mile ahead of everyone 
and cars are bunched back up for a restart after a caution, bringing 
everyone closer to the leader. Sometimes, though, a driver hates to see 
a caution flag — especially when he’s leading by a mile or when his car 
drives better after long runs at full speed.
 
✓ Green-white-checkered sequence: In an attempt to finish races under 
green-flag conditions, NASCAR in 2004 introduced the green-white-
checkered flag sequence. This is used when a yellow flag flies with just 
a few laps remaining and the race would otherwise have finished under 
caution. The new procedure consists of a restart of two laps: the green 
flag for the first lap of the restart and the white flag signaling the final 
lap leading to the checkered flag. Used only during the last two sched-
uled laps of a race, the new format does not guarantee a green-flag 
finish, as only one restart under the green-white-checkered format will 
be attempted. If a caution comes out during that period, the race is fin-
ished. This procedure eliminates the need for a red flag in the final laps 
to immediately stop the race in an attempt to finish under green-flag 
conditions.
 
 One offshoot of the new rule is that crew chiefs have to recalculate gas 
mileage, as under regular racing conditions most cars have the exact 
amount of fuel needed to finish the race as regularly scheduled. With 
events possibly being extended by two laps, a crew chief has to decide 
whether to stop late in the race for a splash of gas or gamble that it will 
finish on the designated lap.
 
✓ Red: If there’s too much oil or fluid covering the track surface, it’s rain-
ing so much that drivers can’t see the track, or a damaged wall or fence 
makes the track unsafe or impossible for cars to continue to circle the 
track under caution, a red flag comes out. When a red flag waves, cars 
must stop in line behind the pace car at the spot on the track where the 
pace car comes to a stop. NASCAR often red flags a race so the fans can 
see as much green flag racing as possible. Instead of watching laps click 
off during a lengthy yellow while officials clean the track, the tower — 
NASCAR’s top officials situated above the start/finish line who call the 
race — will order the red flag to be displayed. During red flags for rain, 
however, they park on pit road. Depending on how long a race is under 

88
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
the red flag, drivers may sit in their cars, get out and talk with one 
another, or — during a long rain delay — head for their motor homes 
parked in the infield.
 
✓ Black: A black flag signals to a driver that he must get off the track and 
go to his pit box. This happens when something is wrong with his car, 
such as oil leaking or smoke billowing from the exhaust, which may 
create a dangerous situation for other cars. The black flag can also come 
out when a driver breaks the rules, like when he jumps the start.
 
 When a driver is black-flagged, he knows it. Not only does the flagman 
wave that ominous, dark flag at him, but his car number is also dis-
played at the start/finish line so drivers know exactly who’s in trouble. 
A driver can’t really ignore getting black-flagged, either, and just stay 
out on the track to race, because at some point, officials get peeved, and 
the flagman breaks out a black flag with a white “X” on it, indicating the 
driver won’t be scored any longer. In that case, a driver should give up 
and head to the pits.
 
✓ Blue with diagonal yellow stripe: When a driver sees this flag, it signi-
fies that faster, lead-lap cars are about to pass him and he has to yield to 
those cars. A flagman usually waves this flag at a driver who is one lap 
down and is significantly slower than the cars racing for the win.
 
✓ White: This flag signals that the driver in the lead is on his final lap.
 
✓ Checkered: When a flagman waves the checkered flag, the winner is 
crossing the finish line.

You may not think of stock-car racing as a team sport. Racing certainly 
seems like an individual sport because the driver gets most of the atten-
tion. While a driver is arguably the most important part of a race team, he 
isn’t the only reason a team wins or loses. Actually, that’s not even close to 
being the case. Dozens of people work on a race team and contribute to the 
performance of a car every weekend. From the owner to the crew chief, the 
engine builder, and the guy who orders parts, everyone on a team has to 
work well — together — in order for the team to succeed (see Figure 7-1).

Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
Consider the driver racing’s version of a quarterback. Even a good quarter-
back can’t accomplish much if his team lets him get sacked.
Paying the Owners Some Respect
In NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing, just as in any sport, the players — in this 
case, the drivers — get most of the credit. But drivers wouldn’t have jobs if 
somebody didn’t employ them. The people who employ NASCAR drivers are 
the team owners.
Securing sponsors and nurturing talent
The owner has the final say in hiring everyone who works on the team, from 
the driver to the crew chief to everyone who prepares the cars for racing. 
The owner spends money on cars and parts, which are quite pricey. For 
example, tires cost nearly $400 apiece. But a far larger expense is all the cash 
the owner shells out for payroll — which isn’t cheap, considering how com-
petitive the sport is and how valuable talented employees are. With all those 
bills to pay and paychecks to sign, an owner has to be a shrewd and savvy 
businessperson.
The owner has to do one thing first: secure a sponsor. The owner approaches 
large corporations and asks for anywhere from $4 to $20 million to sponsor 
a race team for the season. The owner has to convince the companies that 
paying that kind of money will lead to exposure and, ultimately, better sales 
for their products.
To get sponsors, the owner needs to understand the business world beyond 
the business of running a race team. But he or she also needs to know racing. 
An owner has to be able to recognize driving talent on the race track and, 
much like a team owner or a coach in other sports, needs to be able to create 
an environment in which that talent can flourish.

Most NASCAR owners are men, just as most drivers and team members are, 
but several women own teams. For example, Mary Hendrick, the mother 
of Rick Hendrick, my team owner, owns one of Hendrick Motorsports’ four 
teams. (However, she isn’t involved in the day-to-day operations of the team.)

 Chapter 7: Working Together: The Race Team
Inspiring fan loyalty
Some NASCAR Sprint Cup Series team owners have become as famous and as 
popular as their drivers, and some fans have a stronger allegiance to a team 
owner than they do to a driver. So they’ll cheer for any car, for example, that 
Richard Childress owns — no matter who’s behind the wheel.
The following are a few of the more famous — perhaps even legendary — 
NASCAR team owners today:
 
✓ Richard Childress: Childress was the long-time car owner of one of the 
most famous drivers in NASCAR history: seven-time NASCAR Sprint 
Cup champion Dale Earnhardt. Together, the Childress–Earnhardt No. 3 
Chevy team won six titles. Childress was a race car driver before decid-
ing to go the ownership route, which turned out quite well for him. He 
didn’t win any NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races as a driver, but he has 
won more than 88 races as a car owner. He hasn’t slowed down, either. 
In 2007 and 2008, all three of his drivers — Kevin Harvick, Jeff Burton, 
and Clint Bowyer — earned berths in the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint 
Cup. That’s an amazing feat considering the competition level these days.
 
✓ Rick Hendrick: Hendrick became a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series team 
owner in 1984 with Geoffrey Bodine as driver and then became one of 
the first multi-car team owners in the series (see the upcoming section 
“Forming multi-car teams: The more, the merrier”). From 1995 to 1998, 
Hendrick won four consecutive championships — with Terry Labonte 
behind the wheel in 1996 and Jeff Gordon winning in the other three years. 
From 2006 through 2008, Hendrick added numbers six, seven, and eight 
to the list when Jimmie Johnson won three consecutive championships.
Car numbers are the owners’ domain, sort of
Car numbers are assigned by NASCAR to team 
owners. When a driver changes teams, the car 
number he previously drove remains the domain 
of the team owner, as long as the owner remains 
active — for the most part. NASCAR does have 
the final say over which number goes to which 
owner, but the sanctioning body almost always 
grandfathers the number to the owner who had 
it last. For example, when Dale Earnhardt, Jr. 
switched to Hendrick Motorsports, he couldn’t 
bring his No. 8 with him. That number stayed 
with his old team, Dale Earnhardt, Inc. Instead, 
Earnhardt received the No. 88 — which is twice 
as good. (The No. 88 had belonged to Robert 
Yates Racing, but RYR asked NASCAR to trans-
fer it to Hendrick for Earnhardt.)

Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
 
✓ Roger Penske: Penske’s love for racing began as an open-wheel car 
driver when he was young. He then branched out into ownership. He has 
owned teams with an impressive slate of drivers throughout his career: 
Rusty Wallace, Ryan Newman, Kurt Busch, and Sam Hornish, Jr. He also 
owns teams in the IndyCar Series featuring open-wheel cars. (Turn to 
Chapter 1 for more on open-wheel cars.)
 
✓ Richard Petty: Petty is known as the king of stock-car racing not only 
because of his seven NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championships and 
NASCAR-record 200 wins, but also because he’s been a successful car 
owner and has always made himself accessible to the fans throughout 
his long and famous career. The Petty family has always fielded its own 
cars, so Richard knows what he’s doing as a car owner. When Petty 
first began driving in 1958, many drivers owned their cars and teams 
because it was so much less expensive than today, and because they 
wouldn’t have been able to race if they didn’t. Petty stayed an owner 
even as NASCAR changed and costs skyrocketed. It helped that STP Oil 
Treatment was his longtime sponsor. It has also helped that he won so 
many championships and races. Petty Enterprises fields two cars: the 
No. 43 car that Richard made famous, and the No. 45 car.
 
✓ The Wood Brothers: Len and Eddie Wood have been involved in 
NASCAR since their father, Glen, began racing in 1953 — just a few years 
after NASCAR was founded. The two sons continue the family tradition 
with one of the most famous and longest-running teams in the business. 
A number of drivers have recently raced in the No. 21 Ford, including fan 
favorite Bill Elliott. No. 21 has logged at least one victory in each of the 
last five decades, and almost 100 overall.
 
✓ Jack Roush: Team owner Jack Roush partnered with the Fenway Sports 
Group (which owns Major League Baseball’s Boston Red Sox) in 2007 to 
form Roush Fenway Racing. It’s one of the NASCAR powerhouse teams. 
Roush won his first championship in 2003 with Matt Kenseth and one 
year later won again with Kurt Busch. In 2005, all five of Roush’s teams 
earned berths in the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup. Roush has won 
more than 100 races in his career.
 
✓ Joe Gibbs: Joe Gibbs is a prolific character, successful in just about 
everything he does. A former Super Bowl–winning head coach with 
the Washington Redskins, Gibbs has also won two NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series championships with driver Tony Stewart. (Stewart formed his 
own team in 2009, leaving Gibbs after a ten-year tenure with the team.) 
With a stable full of young talents — Kyle Busch, Denny Hamlin, and 
Joey Logano — expect Gibbs’s success to last a whole lot longer.

 Chapter 7: Working Together: The Race Team
Forming multi-car teams: 
The more, the merrier
In the old days, guys used to haul one car down to the track, gather up who-
ever was around to change tires or fill up the tank during pit stops, and go 
racing. Even when the sport got more technical in the 1970s and 1980s, one 
owner usually employed one driver and had one race team.
Good team owners don’t come around often
I have driven for a number of owners in my long 
career, and I’m lucky that they have been some 
of the best and most successful owners in the 
history of NASCAR: Jack Roush, Bobby Ginn, 
Teresa Earnhardt, and now Rick Hendrick.
I’ll likely best be remembered for my years 
with Jack Roush. Jack looked out for me from 
the moment we teamed up in 1988 on his new 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race team until I 
decided to take a small hiatus from the rigors of 
full-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing. In 
2007, I started driving a part-time schedule with 
Ginn Motorsports, which later that year merged 
with Dale Earnhardt, Inc.
In 2009, I got back into the full-time game, joining 
Rick Hendrick’s team, Hendrick Motorsports — 
a team I consider one of the best in the history 
of NASCAR. A lot of people were surprised that 
I decided to leave the cushy lifestyle of a part-
time schedule, but I wanted one more shot at 
winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champi-
onship. I’ve come close a few times. I knew my 
best chance to finally fulfill that dream was with 
Rick. I joked at the press conference announc-
ing my signing with Hendrick Motorsports that 
I didn’t want to be on my death bed saying, 
“I should’ve driven for Rick when I had the 
chance!” It’s true. Everyone wants to drive for 
the best team in NASCAR. It was a chance I 
couldn’t pass up.
The best relationships between owners and 
drivers are the ones with give and take, and 
lots of trust. You can see that trust in the top 
driver–owner relationships, and that’s another 
reason I chose Rick over other owners. I see the 
relationship he has with Jeff Gordon, Jimmie 
Johnson, and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. It’s where I 
wanted to be. Without mutual trust, no owner–
driver combo can have success.
Rick’s one of the most hands-on owners in 
NASCAR Sprint Cup racing, overseeing every-
thing for each of his race teams, from the engine 
program to the body shop to the processes at 
the race track. And I’m one of the more hands-
on drivers in the series, working with the crew 
chief, car chief, and engine specialist to under-
stand exactly how the car is working and pre-
cisely what can be done to make it go faster. 
Some owners and drivers sit back and let the 
team figure things out, which definitely isn’t our 
style. Rick and I are similar in the way we do 
things — and we both care about making our 
team as good as possible.
S

94
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
That’s not the case anymore. One of the most crucial components in being 
successful in racing is information: what a crew learns about the car and 
the tracks, what makes a car go faster, and what doesn’t. With more money 
coming into the sport during the 1990s, owners quickly realized that one way 
to get more information was to use more than one team. When an owner has 
only one driver and team, he has only one source of information. But when 
he adds another team, he gets more — and better — information.
At the race track, multi-car teams can do a bit of experimenting. One car 
can run a particular setup — spring ratios and tire pressures and other 
things — while another tries something slightly different. As practice goes 
on, the crews determine which car handles better and which one runs faster. 
After practice is over, they can exchange the data and determine which setup 
is best, although different drivers sometimes prefer a different feel to the car, 
so teams may have to incorporate further adjustments to set up each indi-
vidual car for a multi-car team.
Multi-car teams also help each other after the race starts, especially at 
restrictor plate tracks where a drafting partner is imperative. For instance, 
you’ll often see Jeff Gordon pushing Hendrick Motorsports teammate 
Jimmie Johnson to the front of the pack at places like Daytona or Talladega. 
Teammates helping each other out during the race make chances of victory 
much higher. (See Chapter 10 for more on drafting.)
When teaming up pays off
When I started racing for Jack Roush in 1988, I 
was his only driver and my team was the only 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series team Jack had 
to worry about. But Jack was one of the first 
owners to realize the benefits of owning two 
teams. So in 1992, I had my first teammate: Wally 
Dallenbach, Jr. And on paper, it paid off. I won 
twice that year, was second five more times, 
and had 17 top-ten finishes altogether. Today, 
Jack has five NASCAR Sprint Cup teams. They 
all have a similar approach to racing, so it’s 
easy to communicate about what’s going on 
with the cars and what drivers should tell the 
crew chiefs.
On the track, the teammate relationship exists 
— within limits. If I was leading a race and a 
teammate had an earlier problem and was a lap 
down but still running strong, I may let him get 
back on the lead lap by allowing him to pass 
me. Or if one of my teammates had a faster car 
than I did and I knew it, I may not try to fight 
him off — I’d probably just allow him to pass. 
But believe me, if I were battling for the win 
with one of my teammates, I’d race him just as 
hard as I would anyone else. Even though we’re 
teammates, we still want to kick the pants off 
each another.
S

95
 Chapter 7: Working Together: The Race Team
Because the demand for information has grown so much in recent years, it 
has become harder and harder for single-car teams to have success. One 
team owner with one car simply can’t learn enough about new tracks and 
new technologies to compete against the multi-car teams and really hope 
to contend for a championship. So as stock-car racing evolves, expect the 
majority of owners to field more than one car in each race.
Many multi-car teams have several different owners on paper. That’s because 
only two teams per owner are eligible for NASCAR’s bonus programs. (See 
Chapter 13 for a list of bonus programs.) These programs can generate a 
good deal of money, depending on a team’s performance, so every team 
owner wants to be involved.
Recognizing the Hands-Off 
Role of a Sponsor
Even though sponsors — the companies that pay for the right to have their 
names on cars — pay most of the bills, they don’t get to hang out at the race 
shop as much as they may want or give advice to drivers on how to make 
their cars run faster. Some sponsors show up at the race shop more often 
than others, but the role of a sponsor is usually limited to paying the bills or 
handling marketing.
S
 
Some sponsors don’t like this limited role very much. Considering how much 
cash their companies are laying out, some sponsors feel they should have 
a say in how a race team functions, meaning which driver to hire and which 
changes should be made to the race car. When a sponsor starts making these 
sorts of decisions, however, it’s almost never good for the race team — unless 
that sponsor has been a successful NASCAR Sprint Cup Series team owner, 
driver, or crew chief! Running a race team is usually best left to the people 
involved in racing — those who know the business and are responsible for a 
team’s performance on the track. Everyone else should just enjoy the results.
Organizing the Operation: 
The Team Manager
 
When I started racing, I thought of a team manager as the kid in high school 
who got water and cleaned towels for the football team. But in racing, the 
team manager serves as the owner’s representative in the shop: someone who 
oversees everything, including ordering equipment, hiring personnel, and 
organizing test sessions. There are just too many details for the owner and 

96
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
crew chief to deal with, so the team manager position was created. Not every 
race team has a team manager, but anytime a team can have another experi-
enced person around, it’s bound to help. Just don’t confuse him with the guy 
who’s supposed to get water for the driver.
The team manager is usually someone with a lot of experience working on 
race cars, often someone who had been a long-time crew chief but wanted 
to step back and take a more administrative role. The team manager isn’t 
hands-on when it comes to how the car is running at a specific time, but he is 
entrusted with hiring candidates for specific jobs.
After the team is assembled, the team manager’s job is to get people to work 
together and to make sure each person is doing his individual job. He works 
closely with the crew chief in overseeing everyone, and — if the owner owns 
more than one race team — he makes sure the teams are working together, 
sharing ideas and information that may benefit both on race day.
Hailing the Crew Chief: A Race 
Team’s Head Honcho
No driver can will a lousy car into Victory Lane. It just can’t happen. Racing 
isn’t like other sports, where the equipment is the same across the board. 
LeBron James doesn’t suddenly have to shoot a deflated basketball while the 
other team gets to use the regular kind. Derek Jeter doesn’t have to swing a 
hollow bat while everyone else gets a solid one. But some days, drivers are 
presented with race cars that just aren’t fast enough to win.
 
That’s where the crew chief comes in. A crew chief oversees everyone in the 
shop to make sure they’re building cars that will go fast on the race track. 
He works from his own experience and whatever notes he may keep on how 
cars have reacted in the past on certain tracks under certain conditions. The 
crew chief tells each of the workers under him the specifications for doing 
his or her job, both at the shop and at the race track. He determines how the 
car bodies are built, how the springs and shocks are adjusted, what level of 
air pressure to run the tires at — everything. It’s a big job. Because of that, he 
usually works longer hours than anyone on the team, looking at numbers and 
considering possibilities. A great crew chief needs to know everything about a 
race car, his driver, and the track he’s going to run next.

97
 Chapter 7: Working Together: The Race Team
Although drivers get a lot of attention, crew chiefs have started to become 
stars in their own right, too. The top crew chiefs have their own trading 
cards, and they’re often asked to sign nearly as many autographs as the 
drivers — all for doing a job that used to be considered anonymous and not 
very glamorous. They deserve all the attention they get, though, because 
they have as much to do with success as anyone involved. Here are three of 
the better-known crew chiefs:
 
✓ Ray Evernham: Some people say Jeff Gordon wouldn’t have won his first 
three championships without Evernham setting up his cars and talking 
him through a race. That may or may not be true, but there’s no doubt 
that Evernham and Gordon had one of the best combinations in racing 
when they were together. They had that special chemistry that a team 
needs to win races. Saying he needed a bigger challenge, Evernham left 
the team in late 1999 to become a car owner and field a multi-car Dodge 
effort.
 
✓ Robin Pemberton: Pemberton was my crew chief from 1988 to 1991. 
His brother, Ryan, also is a crew chief on the circuit, so technical skills 
run in the Pemberton family. Robin left my team to be Kyle Petty’s crew 
chief, but not because we had a falling out. He just needed to move on 
with his career and pursue other challenges. In August 2004, Pemberton 
was named NASCAR’s Vice President of Competition.
A good crew chief is hard to find
When I raced in the American Speed 
Association (ASA) Series, a non-NASCAR 
stock-car series based in the Midwest, I 
worked with crew chief Jimmy Fennig. We hit 
it off right away. He was as intensely dedicated 
to racing as I was, so it was a perfect match. 
Jimmy and I won the 1986 ASA championship 
in just our second year together. In those two 
years, we won 9 races and 13 poles, which is 
amazing considering we hadn’t worked with 
each other for that long. We couldn’t stay 
together forever, though. While he was the 
crew chief in 1986 when I ran my first five 
NASCAR Sprint Cup races, I wasn’t ready to 
drive full-time in the series — and he was, so he 
had to move on without me. Jimmy, who is from 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, worked with NASCAR 
Sprint Cup champion Bobby Allison and almost 
a dozen other drivers until we decided to work 
together again in 1996. Reuniting was one of 
the best moves either of us ever made, consid-
ering what great chemistry there was between 
us even after all those years apart. In 1998, we 
won seven races, the most I’ve ever won in a 
season, and we finished second in the cham-
pionship. Without Jimmy, I couldn’t have done 
that.
One thing that doesn’t change in NASCAR, 
however, is that everything does change. It’s 
difficult to sustain an ideal driver–crew chief 
relationship over the long haul, especially 
during a slump. Jimmy eventually moved on to 
another of Jack Roush’s teams, partnering with 
Kurt Busch when he won the 2004 NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series championship.

Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
 
✓ Chad Knaus: Knaus has been Jimmie Johnson’s crew chief since 2002, 
and the duo has grown into one of the most successful teams in the his-
tory of NASCAR. In 2008, Knaus became the first crew chief to win three 
consecutive NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championships. Always known 
as being “creative” with the rule book, Knaus is now considered one of 
the best crew chiefs in the history of NASCAR.
Making Sure the Work Gets 
Done: The Car Chief
 
Racing has gotten so big over the past few years that owners have had to add 
another layer of management to their teams: the car chief. The car chief is the 
person who works closely with the crew chief in figuring out setups for the 
car, and he’s the guy who actually makes sure it gets done. That allows the 
crew chief more time to work on a computer or look through notes to figure 
out better setups and to work on race strategy. When the crew chief does 
decide on a setup, he discusses it with the car chief, and then the car chief 
goes to the garage and implements the changes. The car chief gathers other 
crew members together, tells them what to do, and then rolls up his sleeves 
and helps get the job done.
Sitting in the Limelight: The Driver
The driver often ends up getting all the credit — and a lot of the blame — for 
how a race team performs. But when you look at the team picture, the driver 
is just one part. That’s particularly true before the race starts.
During the week leading up to a race, the driver may or may not come to the 
race shop where the cars are being prepared. The crew chief has conversa-
tions with the driver about how the car should be set up, but for the most 
part, the team does all the work at the shop.
 
After everyone arrives at the track for a race, teams try to improve their cars 
during practice sessions, when drivers complete laps around the track and 
then come into the garage to tell their crew chiefs what their cars are doing. 
Each driver describes whether the car is reacting correctly to the track and 
where it needs to go faster — in the corners or on the straightaways. The crew 
chief then determines which adjustments to make.
After the race starts, the driver’s role may seem rather obvious: get to the 
finish line before everyone else. But it’s a little more complicated than that. 
I talk more about the driver’s role, and what he has to do during an entire 
week, in Chapter 8.

99
 Chapter 7: Working Together: The Race Team
 
Practice for a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race is some of the most important 
time of the weekend. While the cars may appear to be simply going around 
in circles, in reality, everyone is involved: the driver, the crew chief, the team 
manager, and the crew. The team is finding out everything it needs to know 
about how the car will perform under race conditions.
Practice in stock-car racing is a little different than in other sports, in which 
practice takes place behind closed doors. You don’t see the Green Bay 
Packers practicing in front of the Denver Broncos before the Super Bowl. But 
in racing, everybody gets to see how fast everyone else is running. (How a 
driver runs in practice usually determines how fast he’ll be during a race.)
Building the Rest of the Team
Besides the owner, the team manager, the crew chief, the car chief, and the 
driver, other team members work the garage, too. These team members do 
much more than just strut around looking important. Even though they aren’t 
the primary decision makers on a team, they’re important components to 
building a winning program. Keep in mind that not every team member goes 
to a race; only a set group goes. The others stay at the race shop and work 
on cars for future races. Here are some that go to the track:
 
✓ Engine specialist: The engine specialist, or engine tuner, is in charge of 
taking care of the engines after they get to the race track. Engine special-
ists are the guys you see running around the garage with a tray of spark 
plugs and a magnifying glass. The engine specialist reads a spark plug by 
examining the insides of it and checking for signs of heat — color varia-
tions or spots. After reading spark plugs, the engine specialist determines 
what he needs to do in order to get the optimum power output from the 
engine. The engine specialist is also responsible for the engine’s overall 
health at the track.
Counting laps with the team scorer
On race day, each team has its own scorer 
who counts how many laps a car has made 
around the track. He or she scores laps by hand 
(using a good, old-fashioned pen and a piece 
of paper), but computers also are used. For the 
official tally, NASCAR Timing & Scoring has an 
electronic system that keeps track of cars on 
the speedway. Each car has a transponder (a 
small box) attached to its underside. That tran-
sponder transmits a signal to NASCAR comput-
ers every time it completes a lap. That’s how 
NASCAR knows exactly the position of each car 
and how many laps it’s run, just in case teams 
question it.

100
Part II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
 
✓ Tire specialist: The tire specialist isn’t tough to spot — he’s the guy 
who spends the entire day hanging around the team’s tires, changing 
the air pressure, checking the heat buildup, and measuring the wear of a 
tire after it has taken a few laps on the track. The tire specialist uses an 
instrument to figure out how the tire has worn in certain places — the 
inside, middle, and outside of the tread. He also measures the tempera-
ture of the tire in these locations to determine the heat buildup. The 
way a tire wears or how hot it is in certain places reveals how the car is 
driving on the track. If one tire is too hot in one spot or worn out in one 
specific place, crew members change the car’s setup so that tires touch 
the racing surface more evenly and smoothly — and many times, that 
means the car goes faster. The measurements a tire specialist makes are 
miniscule, so the job may seem insignificant, but it’s critical.
 
✓ Engineers: NASCAR racing prides itself on not using any onboard com-
puters to maximize the car’s output the way other racing series do. Still, 
that doesn’t mean NASCAR is dead set on staying behind the times. 
Over the past few years, stock-car racing has seen an influx of engineers 
who’ve used their advanced degrees to improve how a car runs. Many 
teams use engineers to calculate the exact setup for a car on a certain 
track, including precisely how each shock should be built, which springs 
should be used, and what tire pressures will be best. Most teams have 
become so large and specialized that they have one engineer specifically 
devoted to the shock absorbers.
 
 At first, many old-timers in the sport — and some of the young people — 
resented the engineers for bringing too much technology to NASCAR, which 
had traditionally been a grassroots sport. They felt that stock-car racing 
should stay as basic as possible and remain accessible to people with-
out fancy college degrees. But as racing has become more competitive, 
engineers have become must-have additions to each team.
 
✓ General mechanics: While many team members have specialized titles 
with specialized jobs, some are all-around workers who can do just 
about anything. General mechanics can help the car chief set up the 
car, build shocks back in the trailer, or rework the body of a car after 
a driver crashes it into the wall. Every team has to have a few general 
mechanics to get by — and I feel kind of funny saying that because in 
the past, everyone was a general mechanic. But now it seems everything 
is changing and becoming more specialized. Ask the shock builder how 
to change an engine, and he may laugh at you and run away (hopefully 
not with your shocks in his hands). In this case, NASCAR is a bit like 
baseball. Back in the day, a pitcher pitched the entire game. Now, there 
seems to be a different pitcher for every game situation. But every team 
still needs to have some people with versatility.
 
✓ Pit crew: A maximum of seven people are allowed to go over the pit wall 
and service a car during a pit stop. Although some crew members — 
mechanics, crew chiefs, car chiefs, and tire specialists — still do double 

101
 Chapter 7: Working Together: The Race Team
duty by working at the shop and pitting the car, some teams fly 
specialized pit crew members to the track on race morning. To find out 
more about pit crews and pit stops, turn to Chapter 11.
 
✓ Truck driver: He isn’t the primary pilot, but a team’s truck driver has 
a very important job. If the driver doesn’t do his job right, the team 
may show up at the race track and not have any equipment. The driver 
must be on time and be careful driving the rig with millions of dollars of 
equipment in it. Once at the track, the truck driver also is responsible 
for keeping the inside of the truck in order and maintaining a complete 
inventory of what’s inside, including the following items:
 
• The primary car
 
• The backup car
 
• All the uniforms and equipment for the driver and crew
 
• Tool chests and the war wagon, which carries extra parts for the 
chassis and engine from the garage to pit road
 
• Shock dynamometers to figure out how a shock reacts on the track 
(see Chapter 5 for further explanation)
 
• Extra sheet metal, including noses and rear sections for the car, in 
case of an accident
 
• Cabinets and drawers filled with snacks for the team to munch on 
during long days at the track
The team’s schedule
A race weekend in the NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series isn’t easy or relaxing for a race team. 
It consists of several long, grueling days. The 
weekends usually begin on Thursday for the 
drivers and teams, when they get on a plane to 
travel to the race track. In the late afternoon or 
early evening, teams and drivers arrive in the 
town where the race will be held, go to dinner, 
and then get a good night’s sleep for Friday’s 
activities, which usually consist of qualifying 
and practice sessions. The team needs plenty 
of sleep because the garage usually opens 
before dawn and closes past dinnertime. Teams 
practice and qualify their cars on Friday and 
Saturday; Sunday is usually race day.
Race weekends in the NASCAR Nationwide 
Series and the NASCAR Camping World Truck 
Series aren’t quite as exhausting because, most 
of the time, they aren’t as long. Many events in 
those two series last just two days, with qualify-
ing on the first day and the race on the second 
day. And sometimes, they have what some call 
“one-day shows.” That’s when they practice, 
qualify, and race all in the same day. It’s a long 
day, for sure, but at least you’re not away from 
your family for too long.

 The team hauler is the place where the team members hang out when 
they’re not working on the car. It’s a place to relax and grab some lunch — 
as well as a place to hold ultra-serious meetings on how to make the 
race car better. Most haulers have a lounge in front, equipped with a 
TV, stereo, desk, table, and a couple of comfortable couches. The team 
hauler is where a crew chief goes to crunch numbers for setups, where 
a driver goes to take naps, and where a team owner goes to fire or hire 
a driver at the track. It’s the only private place in the garage area where 
team members can sleep, hold meetings, or work in peace.
Giving a Nod to the People 
behind the Scenes
The work doesn’t end when the race ends. Dozens of team members wait 
back at the shop for the car to return from the race so they can fix it up and 
prepare it for the next race it will run, whether the race is the following week 
or in a month or two. They also build engines, build car bodies, and test 
parts. Although the following team members work behind the scenes, they 
shouldn’t be overlooked:
 
✓ Fabricators: Fabricators have a special talent. They take stock sheet 
metal parts provided by the manufacturer and fasten them together on 
the car frame before molding it all into a sleek, aerodynamic race car. 
They trim the metal and then make it fit the car’s frame precisely — 
called hanging a body in racing terms. If the body isn’t hung properly, 
the aerodynamics of the car won’t be as good as they should be. And 
that slows the car down.
 
✓ Engine builders and engine assemblers: An engine doesn’t just show 
up at a race shop ready to be put into a car. Unless a team leases its 
engines from another engine builder, the engine builders on a team are 
in charge of building the engine nearly from scratch. Engine builders 
figure out how to make the engine as light, but durable, as possible. 
Then engine assemblers put the engines together. The engine specialist, 
who I discuss in the previous section, takes over from there.
 
✓ Parts specialists: At the race shop, teams have a specialist for every-
thing. For example, a suspension specialist is responsible for taking 
apart the suspension from a race car that just raced and then testing to 
see which parts need to be replaced. Having tons of specialists running 
around isn’t a bad thing, considering how much pressure there is to win 
races. Teams can’t afford to lose races because some small, insignificant 
part falls apart after too much use. That’s why everybody on the team is 
so meticulous when building and improving the car.

espite what you may think, NASCAR drivers do much more than just hop 
in their cars, drive around in circles, and win races! Much more goes into 
racing than that — so much so that test sessions, races, sponsor luncheons, 
and commercial shoots take up nearly every second of a driver’s day.
With so many non-racing activities filling a driver’s schedule, race car drivers 
today must be versatile — they must be great drivers, competent public 
speakers, astute businessmen, and half-decent actors (though not necessarily 
Oscar winners).
Working for a Living: The Driver’s 
Role on the Team
Even though drivers are super-versatile, their primary job is to get into cars 
and take chances for three or so hours every Sunday — and nothing will ever 
change that. Drivers also have a better feel for their cars than anyone else, 
so their feedback to their crews about how to make the cars race faster and 
handle better on the track is crucial. My current crew is one of the best I’ve 
ever had, but they’re not mind-readers, so it’s up to me to tell them what I 
need them to do to make the car better.
A driver isn’t just a figurehead who gets all the credit and all the headlines in 
the newspapers. He has to work to make his money, just like everybody else.

104
Par t II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
During practice, a driver doesn’t shut up
A driver can’t be shy when practice begins. His job is to jabber to his team, 
either over the in-car radio or face-to-face after he finishes the run, about 
everything his car is doing. The more input the team gets about the car, the 
better work team members can perform.
Here’s a scenario of what the driver may say to his team throughout a typical 
practice:
 
✓ The driver shows up for practice, dressed in his driving uniform and ready 
to go. He slides into his car and takes a few laps but notices the car is loose 
as he enters the turns, meaning the rear of the car is starting to fishtail 
because the rear tires are losing traction. He contacts his crew via the 
in-car radio, tells them what’s going on, and then heads into the garage.
 
✓ After the car rolls into the garage, the crew chief (or maybe the car chief 
or the engine specialist) runs to the driver’s window to talk more about 
what the car was doing. That person may, for example, decide to change 
the air pressure in one of the tires to see whether that does the trick. Of 
course, they’re working in a rush because they have only a limited time 
for practice — and it never seems like enough when your car isn’t run-
ning well and your team is scrambling to find out what’s wrong.
 
✓ The driver takes to the track with his new setup but quickly finds that the 
car isn’t driving smoothly and that he’s having trouble turning the car. 
There are several terms drivers and crew use to describe how a car is 
handling. A car is loose when a driver goes through a turn and the rear 
of his vehicle starts to fishtail, making the driver feel as if he’s losing 
control and about to spin out; the rear tires aren’t sticking well to the 
track and providing enough traction. When the front tires don’t turn well 
through the turns because the front tires are losing traction before the 
rear tires are, the car is tight. When a car is tight, it also means it’s pushing, 
and if a driver isn’t careful, he will end up zooming into the wall.
 
Although driver input is critical in preparing the car for qualifying, sometimes — 
very rarely — the car runs perfectly after the team unloads it off the truck. The 
driver has no complaints about the car during the first practice, raving to his 
team members the whole time about what a great job they did. When this hap-
pens, a driver usually says his car was great right off the truck. By “truck,” a driver 
means the hauler each team drives race-to-race that carries the cars and all the 
equipment for a race weekend.

105
 Chapter 8: In the Driver’s Seat
When the race starts, there’s no zoning out
 
When the green flag drops, the driver can’t be daydreaming about what he’s 
going to eat for dinner. Not only does he have to concentrate on the race 
track, but he also has to make some pretty important decisions like when 
to make a pass, when to be patient, when to be aggressive, when to save his 
tires (by taking it easy through the turns and not running the car too hard), 
and when to conserve fuel. (Toward the end of a race, sometimes saving fuel 
by not running your car all-out can be the difference between winning and 
losing.) So, even during a 600-mile race like the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe’s Motor 
Speedway, the longest NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race of the year, drivers 
must stay focused at all times.
Staying focused for three or four hours, the length of a typical 400- or 500-
mile race, isn’t easy. Drivers must be mentally disciplined — constantly 
thinking about their cars and how to make them drive better. The driver is 
in constant contact with his crew chief throughout a race, exchanging infor-
mation on the car and what the team needs to do during a pit stop to help 
improve the car’s performance. (Check out Chapter 11 for more on the action 
during pit stops.)
 
Some drivers talk over the radio during practice and races more than others. 
I prefer to say one or two things to my crew chief from time to time instead 
of talking over the radio throughout the race. That lets me concentrate on 
taking the fastest route around the track. Some drivers try to hit certain points 
on the track — a route they’ve mapped out in their heads that they think will 
get them around the track in the fastest time. If it works, they try to repeat the 
previous lap by hitting the points again, by picking out a spot on the wall in 
one corner or choosing a line on the inside of the track in another corner — 
anything that helps them repeat the same lap every time. Drivers aren’t veer-
ing all over the place if they don’t hit their points, but they may not be running 
the fastest lap possible if they take different routes around the race track. (See 
Chapter 10 for the lowdown on strategizing the driving of a race.)
No time for timeouts
NASCAR racing, unlike football and basketball, 
doesn’t incorporate timeouts into the competi-
tion. That’s one of the things that makes stock-
car racing so challenging. Drivers can’t get out 
of their cars or take a bathroom break while 
racing. (Drivers do get a bottle of water at each 
pit stop, however.) After drivers get in their cars, 
they’re in there for the long run. That’s why you 
may see drivers running to portable toilets 
before the race. After that, they just have to 
hold it until the race is over. Often, though, driv-
ers sweat so much during a race that they don’t 
need to go to the bathroom because they’re so 
dehydrated.

106
Par t II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
Respecting Drivers as Athletes
Some people think drivers aren’t athletes because many hide their muscles 
under their uniforms. Plus, after a long race they sometimes climb out of 
their cars gasping for breath. Other people think drivers aren’t athletes 
because stock-car racing doesn’t involve a ball, a bat, or a hoop — all drivers 
do is sit in a car and drive around, right? But if those people were to get into 
a race car on a typical summer day and weave through traffic at 180 mph, I’m 
sure they’d change their minds.
While some drivers aren’t perfect physical specimens, they do have to stay in 
a car where temperatures can exceed 120 degrees for more than three hours 
at a time, concentrating on the road, their car, and the cars around them 
without getting distracted. In order to do this successfully, a driver must 
have lightning-fast reaction times, great coordination, and immense endur-
ance and concentration.
Reacting quickly
Imagine flying down the highway, going about 100 mph, when the car just 
ahead of you spins out and starts rocketing toward you. You’d probably end 
up with at least a couple injuries and a damaged car. But most NASCAR drivers 
have the ability to avoid getting into that wreck. It’s called fast reaction time.
Drivers have incredibly quick reaction times. It’s the same ability that pro 
baseball players have so they can smack balls out of the park even when 
those balls come hurling at them at more than 95 mph. In tests over the 
years, sports medicine doctors have reported that race car drivers have 
some of the fastest hand–eye reaction times — second only to airline pilots. 
Not just anybody can get into a race car and drive inches away from the guy 
ahead of him. Not just anybody can avoid an accident that happens in a split-
second just yards ahead of him. But race car drivers can; that’s why they’re 
able to avoid wrecks every weekend and sometimes make it home without a 
dent on their cars.
Banning clumsiness
Driving a race car isn’t anything like driving your dad’s El Camino to the food 
mart on the corner. Drivers need much more coordination to operate their 
manual transmission, high-performance race cars. They have to shift gears 
quickly, turn the wheel smoothly, step on the brake, and jam on the 
accelerator — all while driving at breakneck speeds.

107
 Chapter 8: In the Driver’s Seat
 
Sometimes, drivers control the brake and clutch pedals with their left foot 
and depress the gas pedal with their right foot, which is different than what 
you learned in your high school driver’s education class. In most cases, using 
the two-foot technique — which means you’re a left-footed braker — is quicker 
than using the same foot on both the gas and brake pedals. Professional race 
car drivers can’t be klutzes — otherwise, they may find themselves careening 
headfirst into the car in front of them when they accidentally press the gas 
instead of the brake.
Building endurance
Even if you’re the best driver in the world, you won’t make it as a stock-car 
driver if you don’t have endurance. Drivers may not be in the same shape as 
long-distance runners or cyclists in the Tour de France, but drivers’ bodies 
must endure a lot: heat, mental strain, pressure to avoid an accident, and 
accidents themselves. Drivers can also handle the intense pressure of compe-
tition, racing 42 other drivers who are among the best in the world. Without 
endurance, we’d never make it through a race. Then again, we wouldn’t be 
drivers in the first place.
Getting into peak condition
Many drivers work out on a consistent basis, and I think staying in shape is 
imperative to being a successful race car driver. As the sport becomes more 
and more competitive, drivers have to be in better physical condition to get 
an edge over everybody else — especially over the newcomers who may 
have youth on their side.
No time to pal around
It’s no secret that a lot of people consider me 
the most focused driver around. And I take that 
as a compliment, although sometimes people 
can take my ultra-focused attitude the wrong 
way, especially at the track. When I head for 
my car just before practice or walk to pit road 
to start the race, it’s not easy for me to smile the 
whole way or stop and sign autographs every 
two seconds because I’m already thinking 
about the race and what I have to accomplish. 
It’s not time for me to pal around with other driv-
ers or joke with fans. Just like any other athlete, 
it’s my time to get in a zone.

Par t II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
As a race car driver, being in good physical shape helps in several ways:
 
✓ You suffer fewer injuries. When drivers get into accidents, if they’re 
in shape, they tend to walk away from scary-looking accidents because 
their muscles protect their bones and internal organs. If a driver is 
flabby, he has nothing protecting his insides. A driver who’s in good 
shape also rebounds from an injury faster.
 
✓ You can handle the heat. If a driver is cardiovascularly fit or in shape 
aerobically, he has an easier time sitting in a steaming-hot car for an after-
noon while sweating off pound after pound. The heat makes a driver’s 
pulse rise, so if a driver’s heart isn’t in shape, making it through a race 
can be very taxing on his heart.
 
✓ You can steer a difficult car. A strong upper body helps a driver wrestle 
the car around a race track when it’s not handling well. A driver can’t 
just leisurely put one hand on the wheel and expect to steer effectively. 
If his upper body is weak, he’ll have a hard time steering.
S
 
Staying in great shape is one of my obsessions, even when I’m at the race 
track. From Monday through Friday, even the Monday after a 500-mile race, I 
wake up at 5:45 a.m. and go to the gym. When I’m at home, I don’t have far to 
go because I set up a gym room that’s connected to my house. When I’m at a 
race, I work out in a gym set up under a tent in the motor home lot. Wherever 
I end up working out, my main objective is to lift weights and keep my muscles 
strong for racing, something I’ve been doing since the 1980s.
Hot Stuff: Dealing with the 
Temperature inside the Car
Even on cool days, the inside of a stock car gets extremely hot for drivers. 
Not only does the engine run incredibly hot, but there’s also no air condi-
tioning. And on days when the outside temperature is in the 90s — like it is 
plenty of times at places such as Daytona Beach, Talladega, or Darlington — 
the temperature inside the car can soar above 120 degrees.
Without air conditioning, drivers get pretty uncomfortable inside their race 
cars. Although a driver needs to wear a suit to protect himself from possible 
fires, a helmet in case of an accident, and gloves to protect himself from heat 
and blisters while grabbing the steering wheel and throwing the stick shift into 
gear, all that equipment makes the conditions even hotter. It’s not uncommon 
for a driver to lose anywhere from 3 to 10 pounds after sweating during a single 
race. The car’s main exhaust system used to travel through a pipe directly 
under the driver’s seat, which only added to the heat produced by the car 

109
 Chapter 8: In the Driver’s Seat
during a race. Occasionally, the seat would get so unbelievably hot that I would 
feel it on my back and legs for days afterward. Now that the exhaust system 
travels under the passenger side of the car, the heat is not as bad.
 
The floor of the car can get extremely hot. That’s why drivers wear special 
driving shoes with a silvery, aluminum foil–looking cover around the heels 
and on the soles. But sometimes, drivers need additional help to protect their 
feet, so they strap extra pieces of insulation — called heat shields — onto their 
heels when the floor is extra hot. Some of the older drivers have figured out 
alternatives to protecting their feet, claiming the bottom part of a Styrofoam 
cup works better than anything else to keep their feet cool.
While drivers can’t turn on the air conditioner or roll down the window for a 
shot of cold air, they’re not left to suffer without fresh air flow: All teams have 
a cooling system inside the car that injects air into the driver’s helmet and 
up through holes in the seat (see Figure 8-1). It’s a system of tubing that flows 
from a box with a fan (and sometimes dry ice) in it. Without this air flow, 
drivers would have trouble staying conscious on hot days.
Ricky Rudd, a retired race car driver who began his NASCAR Sprint Cup 
career in 1974, found out the hard way how important an in-car ventilation 
system is on a hot day. His “air conditioner” malfunctioned during the fall 
race at Martinsville Speedway in 1998. It was more than 90 degrees outside 
that day and approached 150 degrees in the car, with no cool air blowing into 
his helmet or up through his seat. He held on to win the race, but he had to 
be helped out of his car in Victory Lane. He fell to the ground, with blisters 
and burns on his backside, and paramedics gave him oxygen so he wouldn’t 
pass out. Even though he felt awful and could barely talk, Rudd still gave 
post-race interviews while lying down. Later, he was given intravenous fluids 
because he was so dehydrated.
Need space and distractions? Don’t try racing!
If you’re the claustrophobic type, stock-car 
racing isn’t for you. Drivers have to squeeze 
into their tight-fitting seats and stay strapped 
in for several hours. You can’t stretch, and you 
don’t get much air flow. You contemplate the 
road ahead, how your car is running, and ways 
to win a race — and that’s pretty much it.
If you have a short attention span, driving a race 
car isn’t for you, either. You won’t find a radio or 
a CD player in a race car. You can’t hear much 
besides the drone of the engine, and you don’t 
really see much — just the same scenery over 
and over again. Drivers are used to that, though. 
After years of training, they can focus on the 
track for hours.

Racing All Over the Nation
When drivers aren’t racing, they’re rarely lounging at home watching a 
TV shopping network or pulling weeds in the yard. Their schedules are so 
packed that they barely have enough time to sneeze after they get home from 
a race before they have to take off for another event. In 2008, the NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series had 36 points races (see Chapter 14 for a list of the tracks 
that hold NASCAR races).
On top of the points races are two exhibition races every year that don’t 
count toward the NASCAR Sprint Cup championship:
 
✓ The Budweiser Shootout at Daytona International Speedway in 
February, which, starting in 2009, includes the top six teams from each 
car manufacturer. Previously, only the previous season’s pole winners 
qualified for the Budweiser Shootout.
 
✓ The NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race held in May at Lowe’s Motor 
Speedway in Concord, North Carolina, which features past winners, the 
winner of the NASCAR Sprint Showdown (an event featuring those who 
have not qualified for the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race), and a driver 
voted in by the fans.

 Chapter 8: In the Driver’s Seat
A family tradition
Many families have been in the sport for 
generations — including the Frances, who 
started NASCAR. Here are a few NASCAR 
racing families involved in the sport.
The Pettys:
 ✓ Lee — Winner of the first Daytona 500 in 
1959. Won NASCAR Sprint Cup champion-
ships in 1954, 1958, and 1959.
 ✓ Richard (Lee’s son) — Holds the NASCAR 
record for career victories (200) and is tied 
with the late Dale Earnhardt for the most 
NASCAR Sprint Cup championships (7).
 ✓ Kyle (Richard’s son) — Races in the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
 ✓ Adam (Kyle’s late son) — Raced in the 
NASCAR Nationwide Series.
The Earnhardts:
 ✓ Ralph — Raced in NASCAR in the late 1950s 
and early 1960s.
 ✓ Dale (Ralph’s son) — Shares the NASCAR 
record for most NASCAR Sprint Cup titles 
(7) with Richard Petty.
 ✓ Dale Jr. (Dale’s son) — Won two consecu-
tive NASCAR Nationwide Series champion-
ships, including in 1998, his first full season 
in the series. He advanced to NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series racing in 2000 and won 
the Daytona 500 in 2004.
The Jarretts:
 ✓ Ned — Two-time NASCAR Sprint Cup 
champion (1961 and 1965).
 ✓ Dale (Ned’s son) — Won the 1999 NASCAR 
Sprint Cup title.
 ✓ Jason (Dale’s son) — Raced in the NASCAR 
Nationwide Series from 1997 to 2000.
The Labontes:
 ✓ Terry — Two-time NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series champion (1984 and 1996).
 ✓ Bobby (Terry’s younger brother) — The 
2000 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion.
 ✓ Justin (Terry’s son) — A former NASCAR 
Nationwide Series competitor.
The Bodines:
 ✓ Geoffrey — The 1986 Daytona 500 winner.
 ✓ Brett (Geoffrey’s brother) — Raced in the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and NASCAR 
Nationwide Series. He now works at the 
NASCAR Research and Development 
Center as Director of Cost Research.
 ✓ Todd (Geoffrey’s youngest brother) — 
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series 
champion (2006) and part-time NASCAR 
Nationwide Series competitor.
The Wallaces:
 ✓ Rusty — The 1989 NASCAR Sprint Cup 
champion.
 ✓ Mike (Rusty’s brother) — Races in the 
NASCAR Nationwide Series.
 ✓ Kenny (Rusty’s brother) — Races in the 
NASCAR Nationwide Series.
 ✓ Steve (Rusty’s son) — Races in the NASCAR 
Nationwide Series.
 ✓ Chrissy (Mike’s daughter) — Races in the 
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.
While plenty of family members have competed 
in NASCAR over the years, nobody beats the 
Pettys in longevity and racing lineage. Adam 
Petty was the fourth generation of the family to 
race in NASCAR — and no other pro sport can 
say that it has had a fourth-generation athlete 
in its ranks.

Par t II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
With 38 weekends of the year accounted for, drivers still have plenty of time 
for themselves during their off weekends, right? Wrong. With test sessions, 
sponsor commitments, commercial shoots, and series banquets, those addi-
tional weekends are spoken for.
A packed calendar
The days of the week before the driver goes to a race are filled with things 
to do. At most, a driver has one day at home to handle his personal business 
before he’s off to a test or to an autograph session someplace far from home.
Here’s a snapshot of a typical week for a driver:
 
✓ Monday: If he’s lucky, a driver gets to sleep in on Monday after what’s 
usually a long day at the races. Most of the time, it’s the only day a driver 
can spend with his family at home and take care of personal business. 
More often than not, though, he has to go to a sponsor appearance and 
sign autographs — many times hundreds and even thousands of 
miles away.
 
✓ Tuesday: Teams often conduct two-day testing sessions at race tracks 
where the teams will race in a few weeks, with the sessions beginning on 
Tuesday. For example, drivers and teams test at Daytona International 
Speedway for several days in January, but the Daytona 500 isn’t until 
mid-February. It’s just like preparing for an exam. Teams experiment 
with their cars, trying different setups in order to find just the right one 
for the upcoming qualifying session and race. They talk about the fastest 
way to get around the track and discuss what they’ll do when they return 
for the real thing.
 
 During a test, the driver has to be at the track early in the morning, 
prepared to slip into the driver’s seat and start the session. Even though 
he’s not racing against 42 other drivers during the session, testing a race 
car isn’t easy and may require running hundreds of laps. A session usually 
lasts from dawn until dark, and teams use every minute of the 
precious time.
 
 If there’s no test, Tuesday is a day at the race shop. A driver will meet 
with his crew and his crew chief, go over car setups from the past week-
end, and figure out what will work for the following race. A driver will 
also get fitted for the following race’s seat, do some interviews with the 
media, and sign fan mail.
 
✓ Wednesday: Frequently, Wednesday is the second day of a two-day test 
session. But if a driver isn’t testing that day, he’s at an appearance for 
one of his sponsors, or he’s back at the shop for more team meetings. 
Ideally, the appearances are held near a race track (at a car dealership 
or an auto parts store) where the series is racing that weekend.

113
 Chapter 8: In the Driver’s Seat
 
✓ Thursday: This is usually a travel day for drivers because most race 
tracks open for practice on Friday. Drivers fly to the town where a race 
is held and then head for the race track where their motor homes are 
already prepared for their arrival. (See the upcoming section “[Motor] 
home away from home.”) Occasionally, drivers are already at the tracks 
on Thursday for pre-race events.
 
✓ Friday: The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series drivers qualify their cars for the 
Sunday race on Fridays (see Chapter 9). They also participate in several 
practice sessions during the day. After the garage closes, drivers often 
meet with fans and sponsors at an appearance, making the drivers’ days 
quite long.
 
✓ Saturday: Drivers don’t get Saturday off. They’ve got to go to the track 
and practice, making final changes on the car’s engine or its setup for 
race day. Some NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers also race in the NASCAR 
Nationwide Series. Those NASCAR Nationwide races are usually held on 
Saturdays. If the NASCAR Sprint Cup drivers aren’t racing in it, they’re 
probably watching it.
 
 Happy Hour (aka Final Practice) is the final hour of practice for the race, 
usually held the afternoon before race day. During this time, drivers and 
teams make last-minute — and sometimes harried — changes on their 
cars. Because of the urgency, Happy Hour is a crazed 60 minutes of cars 
whizzing in and out of the garage after running laps on the track. Not all 
teams leave the track happy after Happy Hour, however — especially 
the ones whose cars ran slowly or whose drivers got into a late-practice 
accident.
 
✓ Sunday: Most races are held on Sunday (although a few are on Saturday 
night). On race days, drivers do much more than just drive in a race:
 
• Sponsors’ meeting: On race days, drivers get dressed in nice pants 
and a shirt with their sponsor’s logo on it and then head for the 
garage. Most of the time, they have a prescheduled appearance — 
called hospitality — with a group of employees of one of their spon-
sors. Drivers give a talk and answer questions. It’s a little strange 
for the driver to give a pep talk to fans only a few hours before the 
race, but that’s all a part of racing and having a sponsor paying the 
bills. You don’t see football players talking to people in the suites 
a couple hours before game time, but that’s the difference between 
racing and football.
S
 
 Sometimes, thousands of employees from a sponsor’s company 
show up at hospitality, where the sponsor sets up a tent and serves 
breakfast or lunch. As a driver, I have to be ready to address all 
those people, even though I may be nervous about the race or think-
ing about my race car. When a driver finishes his talk, he signs auto-
graphs for a while before heading back to the garage for the drivers’ 
meeting.

Par t II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
 
• Drivers’ meeting: One of the most important things on race days 
is to make it to the drivers’ meeting, held two hours before each 
event. (I discuss the meeting in detail in Chapter 6.) If a driver or 
his crew chief misses the meeting, the driver must start the race in 
the last position, no matter where he qualified.
 
• Church service: Right after the drivers’ meeting, many drivers, 
teams, and their families stay for a brief church service that’s held 
on race morning.
 
• Driver introductions: About a half hour before the race, drivers 
assemble for driver introductions at a stage near the start/finish 
line. At this time, awards may be given out for teams that did well 
the week before or for the team that won the pole for that day’s 
race. Each driver’s name is then announced as he walks across the 
stage, waving to fans. Drivers sometimes ride in the back of a car 
or truck, taking a lap around the track to wave to all the fans.
 
• The race: This is the main event — what drivers do all the other 
stuff for.
 
 If a driver is injured prior to the race, as Dale Earnhardt, Jr. was 
while competing in a sports-car race in the summer of 2004, a sub-
stitute must be found. In Earnhardt’s case, the ride went to Martin 
Truex, Jr., who then drove for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. in the NASCAR 
Nationwide Series. (Truex now drives in the NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series.) Earnhardt didn’t lose any points because he managed to 
drive at least one lap before turning the car over to Truex.
 
• Post-race: When a driver wins, he spends nearly 45 minutes in 
Victory Lane celebrating, taking pictures, and doing some TV 
interviews. Then he answers the questions of the print media for 
another half-hour in the media center, followed by more photos 
out in Victory Lane. Drivers who come in second or third also give 
interviews with the press, explaining how their cars performed 
and what they saw during the race. Even drivers who didn’t finish 
well usually stick around to make a few quick comments. If a driver 
crashed, he can expect to be bombarded with questions when he 
emerges from the infield care center. (Every driver who crashes 
has to make a mandatory trip to the infield care center for a 
checkup before doing anything else.)
 
 Throughout a race weekend, drivers must deal with reporters — TV 
reporters wielding cameras and microphones; newspaper report-
ers with pens, pads, and tape recorders; and radio reporters with 
headsets and microphones. Whoever they are, the driver has to talk 
to them at some point during the weekend — or at several points: 
before practice, after practice, before qualifying, after qualifying, just 
after crashing during qualifying, after winning the pole, after losing 
the race, or after winning the race. That’s what makes NASCAR the 
most accessible sport around.

115
 Chapter 8: In the Driver’s Seat
 
• Getting home: Because the racing season is long and the schedule 
is packed, most teams and most drivers have their own planes. 
Some teams have as many as three, for those crew members who 
have to stay after the race to re-pack equipment. Immediately 
following the race, the driver (if he’s not in Victory Lane) heads for 
a local airport and is in the air within the hour. The biggest prob-
lem is the traffic on the runway because nearly all the other teams 
are trying to leave at the same time.
(Motor) home away from home
Drivers and their families spend at least three days and nights at each race. 
Three nights multiplied by 36 (the number of NASCAR Sprint Cup points 
races per season) is 108 nights away from home! In the past dozen years or 
so, drivers, owners, and some crew chiefs got tired of spending all those 
nights in hotel rooms, so they began bringing motor homes to the races.
 
The kind of motor homes you find in the driver and owner motor home area 
(called the motor home lot) at the races aren’t at all like pop-up campers. Many 
times, they’re quite luxurious, with more amenities than the typical home. 
Most of them have TVs (connected to satellite dishes), a bedroom, a living 
room with leather couches, good-sized showers, glass cabinets, full-sized 
refrigerators, kitchen tables, and music systems. This way, drivers and their 
families are quite comfortable.
A motor home driver, who works for the race car driver, drives the vehicle 
from track to track. After he gets to a certain track for a race weekend, the 
motor home driver stocks it with food, extra uniforms, and other essentials 
and then checks into a hotel.
Meeting Richard Petty
To give you an idea of how easy it was — 
and still is — to meet a driver, here’s how I 
met Richard Petty, NASCAR’s King. Petty is 
NASCAR’s winningest driver, with 200 victories 
and seven NASCAR Sprint Cup championships. 
He was just hanging out in his race shop when 
my dad and I went to visit. I was a teenager then 
and, of course, my jaw dropped when I saw 
him, but my dad was bold enough to approach 
him and introduce us. Richard Petty was the 
most gracious guy I’d ever met, and he talked 
to us for about ten minutes. Meeting Petty, who 
was, in my mind, the ultimate human being next 
to my dad, was one of the best things I’d ever 
experienced. There he was, the most famous 
stock-car driver in the world, just chatting with 
us about racing! To this day, that’s one of the 
most memorable moments of my life.

116
Par t II: What Makes It Stock-Car Racing? 
Drivers don’t get fancy motor homes to show off. They just want to make 
things as cozy as possible. The motor homes also make it possible for the 
drivers to bring their spouses and children to the races — and have them 
at the race track at all times. In the past, drivers were stuck at the track 
between practice and qualifying with nowhere to go or hang out, while their 
families were biding time in the hotel room or staying at home. Now, drivers 
have a private place to go to be with their families at any point of the day and 
not have to deal with traffic, crowds, or rowdy fans.
The motor home lot is a small, mobile village with all the same people trav-
eling from race to race. It’s kept safe by security guards who protect the 
entrances and monitor the grounds.
Motor Racing Outreach
Because of the popularity of NASCAR racing, drivers usually can’t go casu-
ally strolling through town looking for new restaurants, gyms to work out 
in, or places to go to church because they’d be swarmed by fans. In order to 
help out drivers and their families during all the weekends away from home, 
Motor Racing Outreach (MRO) provides many services for drivers and their 
families at the track. I don’t know what drivers would do without it.
The following are the services MRO provides:
 
✓ Church services are held every race morning, just after the drivers’ 
meeting. Drivers don’t have time to go to a regular church on race day, 
especially with all the traffic headed toward the track, so the MRO inter-
denominational Christian church services give them a chance to keep 
their faith alive. MRO also organizes prayer groups throughout the week-
end, held in the motor home lot.
 
✓ When the drivers are in the garage area, their kids aren’t stuck in the 
motor home watching TV. MRO has a daycare center in a motor home, 
bought with funds donated by drivers and their wives and corporations, 
where children read and learn — all under the care of MRO volunteers.
 
✓ For those racing team members and families who want to stay in shape, 
there is a little workout center in the motor home lot that travels to every 
race. It’s set up next to the MRO motor home and has a few treadmills, 
stationary bikes, and free weights.

ASCAR races aren’t the simplest events to follow. 
They’re not like football games where two teams 
play for 60 minutes and are done. NASCAR events last sev-
eral days, beginning with qualifying for the race (usually 
on Friday) and ending with a celebration in Victory Lane 
on Sunday (or sometimes Saturday night).
This part decodes every move that teams and drivers 
make on the track and in the garage during a race week-
end, including race strategies and pit stops. I also explain 
why a driver can bump into another competitor without 
getting even a scratch.
If you want to know what’s going on during every moment 
of a race weekend — or even just on race day — you’ll 
have fun reading this part. Like a good mystery novel, you 
won’t be able to put it down.

B
efore drivers hear the famous command, “Gentlemen, start your 
engines!” they must qualify for the race. That means they’re not going 
anywhere unless they prove they’re worthy to start — and to do that, they 
have to show that their cars are fast enough. Regardless of how fast a car is, 
qualifying is nerve-wracking.
Drivers qualify for a certain race by completing one full-speed lap around the 
track (or in some cases, two laps) without crashing or losing control of their 
cars. Qualifying, which is normally held on the Friday before Sunday’s race, 
sets the starting lineup and, if there are more cars attempting to qualify than 
the 43 allowed for each race, weeds out the slowest. Just about every week a 
few drivers fail to qualify. It’s depressing when drivers and teams travel across 
the nation for a race and then don’t even get to compete in it. It’s like driving 
to California from the East Coast for a concert, only to find that the concert is 
sold out.
The Importance of Qualifying Well
Qualifying isn’t easy. A driver has to map out a specific route — or line — 
around the track that he thinks will be the fastest, although that fast quali-
fying lap is still like riding a runaway roller coaster that may derail at any 
second. Teams also tinker with their cars to provide an extra burst of speed 
for that one lap. During a race, a driver must be patient and careful over the 
course of 400 or 500 miles in order to make it to the finish line and win. That 
driver must also be patient and careful during qualifying, or he will most 

120
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
likely be watching the race from his living room sofa rather than competing 
in it. Driving one lap may seem like an easy job, but if you lose your concen-
tration and nick the wall just once, you may not qualify and instead be 
heading home.
Starting up front is groovy
 
A lot of work goes into making a car qualify well because, depending on the 
track, starting up front could be the difference between winning and losing 
the actual race. Tracks in NASCAR all race a little differently — especially 
when it comes to letting a driver pass other cars (see Chapter 14 for more 
on the different tracks). Some tracks are one-groove race tracks, which means 
there’s only one comfortable way to get around a track fast without putting a 
driver at risk of crashing. (A groove is a part of the track where the car’s tires 
get the best grip, and if the car drifts out of that groove, it becomes less stable 
and more difficult to control.) These one-groove race tracks, such as New 
Hampshire Motor Speedway, make passing another car very difficult because 
when a driver pulls out of the groove to attempt a pass, his car doesn’t handle 
well. And a car that doesn’t handle well doesn’t go very fast. Other tracks have 
a high groove and a low groove, meaning cars can run side-by-side or two-wide 
around the track, while some tracks let cars race easily on just about any part 
of the track.
Qualifying well is especially important at one-groove race tracks because 
passing is so difficult. So, if a driver starts fifth, he has a chance of making it 
to the front. If he starts 25th, though, advancing is more difficult, unless the 
cars ahead of him have problems, because getting out of the groove to pass 
that many cars will slow him down too much.
Qualifying well is also important when racing on a smaller track, such as the 
.526-mile Martinsville Speedway. Most short tracks physically just don’t have 
enough room for cars to race two-wide, so passing is difficult. Starting up 
front makes the day much less stressful.
The days before qualifying
In the old days, there were no limits on the 
number of cars that started a race. For exam-
ple, 75 cars started the first Southern 500 back 
in 1950. They crammed onto the 1.2-mile track, 
running perilously close to one another. Today, 
though, NASCAR is much more safety-oriented 
and limits the number of cars that compete in 
a race to 43.

121
 Chapter 9: First, They Qualify
Winning the pole
 
Drivers and crews scramble during the practice before qualifying to get the 
car just right for the run — one they hope will be fast enough for them to win 
the pole. The pole winner (or pole sitter) is the driver who runs the fastest lap 
during qualifying, which means he starts the race in the front row and gets to 
pick either the inside or outside starting position. (NASCAR races start with 
only two cars in each row; so you have 21 two-driver rows and a single driver 
starting from the rear of the field in the final “row.”) The pole winner starts 
from the inside, or closest to the grass, giving him a slight edge as the field 
enters the first turn. The second-fastest qualifier usually starts the race on the 
outside of the front row, which is the outside pole. It’s an honor to win the pole 
because the driver’s accomplishment is announced at driver introductions, 
his photo is taken, and he receives awards. Plus, the competition respects the 
driver a little more for it. They know how hard it is to be the best qualifier, 
considering the fastest car (1st) and the slowest car (43rd) are often sepa-
rated by less than one second.
Winning the pole is a big deal because that driver is in the best position 
to lead and win the race — even before the race starts. For at least a few 
moments, that driver has the best view of the race track. He also receives at 
least $5,500 for winning the pole, even if he gets passed right after the green 
flag drops.
There’s one more benefit to winning a pole: pit box selection. A pit box is the 
spot where a car is serviced during pit stops. The pole winner gets the first 
pick of pit boxes, which can often help a driver gain — or lose — spots on pit 
road. The pole winner usually picks the very first pit box, which is easy to get 
in and out of during a pit stop. The second-fastest qualifier gets the second 
pick, and so on.
Mapping Out a Track Attack
 
Most tracks are ovals, with two long strips of race track connected by sweep-
ing turns at both ends. People started labeling the turns so that drivers and 
crew chiefs could talk about the race track — and have some landmarks to 
help them figure out where the car is doing what and where to make their 
moves; see Figure 9-1. Now they can say, “The car scraped the wall in turn 
two,” and everyone can immediately picture what happened. Drivers compete 
on the track by circling it counterclockwise. The section of race track where 

122
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
the start/finish line is located is called the frontstretch, front straight, or front 
straightaway. It’s where you see cars racing each other to the finish in the last 
seconds of a race. The strip of race track on the opposite side of the track is 
called the backstretch, back straight, or back straightaway. The turns connect 
the two straightaways in the following way:
 
✓ Turn one is located at the end of the front straightaway and is the 
first turn the race car drivers make during a race.
 
✓ Turn two is at the beginning of the backstretch.
 
✓ Turn three is at the end of the backstretch.
 
✓ Turn four is at the beginning of the frontstretch.
On most NASCAR ovals, turns one and two, as well as turns three and four, are 
directly connected, with no straightaway between them to make each turn its 
own separate corner. (Indianapolis Motor Speedway is an exception; it has a 
straightaway between each turn.) Still, that single, big, banked turn that you 
see at each end of most NASCAR ovals is considered to be two different turns.

 Chapter 9: First, They Qualify
Although most NASCAR tracks are ovals, there are several variations in 
shape, as well as a few oddball tracks. And drivers and teams have to adjust 
to each in order to make sure they get the fastest qualifying time possible. 
(For more information on the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series’ different tracks, 
turn to Chapter 14.) Here are the different types of tracks:
 
✓ A standard oval is the most common track shape in the NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series.
 
✓ D-shaped ovals are modified ovals that have one long sweeping arc of 
a turn for a frontstretch instead of a straightaway. (You may hear many 
fans at these tracks refer to the frontstretch as the “frontstraight,” but 
it’s not straight at all.)
 
✓ Tri-ovals are modified ovals where the frontstretch consists of two sec-
tions of angled straightaways connected in the center by a slight corner.
 
✓ Quad ovals have two slight corners in the middle of the frontstretch.
 
✓ A triangle track, like the Pocono Raceway, is in its own category. It has 
three straights, each of a different length, and three corners, each with a 
different length and degree of banking.
 
✓ Road courses more or less resemble a winding country highway and 
have a number of sharp, difficult turns.
Getting the Car Ready for the Run
Winning the pole isn’t the same as winning the race, but in NASCAR, every 
aspect of racing is competitive. Drivers, crews, and team owners put a lot of 
effort into running the fastest lap in qualifying.
Preparing the car for a qualifying run is hard work. First, the driver takes the 
car on the track during practice to see how fast it is and how it handles. After 
every practice session, NASCAR puts out a timesheet that ranks the cars from 
fastest to slowest. Then the scrambling starts. If a driver’s car isn’t at the top 
or near the top of the list, he has to change something so that his car can go 
faster. Some of the things drivers and crews change or fine-tune during prac-
tice include the following:
 
✓ Balance: The most important thing to perfect during practice for qualifying 
is the car’s balance. A driver doesn’t want one end of the car to stick to 
the track or have more traction than the other end because an unbal-
anced car is slow and hard to handle. A team can adjust the balance by 
inserting lead weights into the frame rails of the car. Then, depending 

124
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
on how the driver says the car is driving, they can move these chunks of 
lead within the frame rails to redistribute weight toward any of the four 
corners of the car in order to get the traction as even as possible.
 
✓ The engine: In order to have a fast qualifying lap, a car’s engine must 
run perfectly. So while taking practice laps, a driver looks at his tachom-
eter (the gauge that measures how many revolutions an engine is making 
per minute) in order to see how hard the engine is working. If the engine 
is working too hard or not hard enough, a team changes the car’s gears 
to maximize the engine’s output. Teams also must consider the weather 
when deciding what gears to put in their cars. Usually, when it’s really 
hot, a lower gear ratio is required, and vice-versa.
 
 Drivers listen to the engine to find out how it’s working. They know 
exactly how it should sound when it’s working right. If it sounds funny — 
too high-pitched or not smooth — they take the car right into the garage 
and have the crew look at it.
 
✓ The shock and spring combination: In qualifying, particularly at super-
speedways where aerodynamics play such a crucial role, the closer the 
car is to the ground, the faster it cuts through the air. Whenever air gets 
beneath a car, it slows it down. So teams try to figure out the right shock 
absorber and spring combination to get the car as close to the ground 
as possible without letting it bottom out (get too close to the ground). 
For more on aerodynamics, turn to Chapter 14. To find out about differ-
ent components of the suspension, flip to Chapter 5.
 
✓ Taping off: When a team wants to see exactly how a car will do in quali-
fying, it prepares the car for an all-out run. Part of that preparation is 
taping the car off, which means the team places heavy-duty tape over the 
car’s grille (the screen at the front of the car leading to the radiator) in 
order to prevent air from going through the grille and slowing the car 
down. A car runs fastest when air is flowing over it instead of through it 
or under it. That way, the car is sleeker and faster as it moves through 
the air.
 
 Even though taping off allows a car to go faster, teams can’t do this during 
the actual race. With no air flowing into the radiator to cool the engine, a 
taped-off car wouldn’t last very long in a 500-mile race. The engine would 
go kaput after a certain point when it became too hot.
Picking the Qualifying Order
Drivers don’t just drive randomly onto the track to make their qualifying laps. 
The whole process is precisely orchestrated — it has to be. The qualifying 
times of all the drivers are frequently separated by less than one second. So 
if even one element is amiss, a driver’s qualifying time could easily put him at 
the back of the pack.

125
 Chapter 9: First, They Qualify
Playing bingo
To start the process, representatives from each NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
team gather to determine the qualifying order. Each representative picks a 
ball with a number on it out of a small rotating sphere — just like the ones 
used in your local bingo parlor. But instead of yelling “BINGO!,” the represen-
tative returns to his driver and crew to announce when the driver will go out 
to qualify.
The order of picking balls is determined by owner points. Team owners 
receive points for each race, based on the performance of their cars in that 
race (no matter who’s driving).
Letting non-guaranteed cars go last
As I explain in the upcoming section “Banking on a Guaranteed Starting 
Position,” drivers for the top 35 teams in terms of car owner points are guar-
anteed positions in each race. That leaves 8 positions up for grabs because 
43 cars start each race.
In 2008, NASCAR changed its rules to make life more fair for cars that aren’t 
guaranteed a spot in the field. Teams that aren’t in the top 35 in car owner 
points now run their qualifying laps at the end of qualifying. Previously, the 
non-guaranteed cars were sprinkled throughout the field depending on the 
luck of the draw. The new system offers a slight advantage to the non-guar-
anteed cars because qualifying times tend to be faster later in the day. That’s 
because the track is cooler later in the day, and more tire rubber has been 
laid, which creates more traction and faster speeds.
Qualifying butterflies
As the years have gone by, I’ve gotten more and 
more nervous on qualifying day — literally to 
the point where I’m on the verge of getting sick 
to my stomach. I guess that’s because getting 
a good spot in the starting field has become 
more difficult as the sport grows. Every time 
I go out to qualify, I have to drive close to the 
edge in order to get the best possible starting 
position. It’s a tremendously intense experi-
ence because the expectations, especially my 
own, are so high. Maybe that’s why I’ve always 
been known as a pretty good qualifier. I’ve also 
gained confidence from the fact that I’ve never 
failed to qualify for a NASCAR race.
S

126
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
The non-guaranteed teams pick their qualifying order the same way as other 
teams — by picking a ball with a number on it. After all the teams have 
picked their spots, the non-guaranteed cars are shifted to the end of quali-
fying, and they qualify in order according to the number they picked. For 
example, say there are three non-guaranteed cars — car X, car Y, and car Z. 
Car X draws number 23, car Y draws number 12, and car Z draws number 4. 
After all cars have drawn a qualifying number, the three non-guaranteed cars 
are dropped to the end of qualifying in this order: car Z, car Y, car X.
Realizing why qualifying order matters
Why does everyone care so much about when their driver qualifies? It’s not 
because they want to get done early so they can catch the evening news. 
Sometimes, qualifying order can be crucial because weather plays a key role 
in how fast the cars run on the track. In hot weather the track is slippery, 
so the car doesn’t stick very well, particularly going through turns. That 
means the driver must slow down to keep from losing control. In normal 
weather, the track is cooler and the tires adhere to the track better, so the 
drivers can go fast through the turns without worrying about crashing. (In cool 
weather, though, the tires may be cold, which results in little traction and often 
in a crash. That’s one of the reasons you see drivers swerving back and forth 
on the race track before a race. They’re doing two things: warming up their 
tires, and cleaning off any debris that may have gotten stuck to their tires.)
In hot weather, the driver who picks the No. 1 qualifying spot and qualifies at the 
usual mid-afternoon time may run at the hottest — and slowest — time of 
the day. The driver who picks the last qualifying spot may be in luck, especially 
if the sun goes down some by the time he qualifies and the track is faster.
Rain changes everything
The weather report is key on qualifying day. No 
driver wants to see rain drops — especially a 
driver who doesn’t have a guaranteed spot. Rain 
can ruin everything. If it rains hard enough and 
the track gets wet and slick enough, NASCAR 
loses the track — meaning it’s too danger-
ous for cars to run on. This could lead to the 
cancellation of qualifying, which would send 
home non-guaranteed cars without getting a 
chance to qualify. In this situation, the field is 
then set using a number of factors. All cars in 
the top 35 (in terms of owners’ points) get in. 
Race-winning drivers and/or car owners from 
the previous and current season not already in 
the field make it in. And all past champions and 
those teams that have made the most attempts 
to qualify during the season make it into the big 
show.

127
 Chapter 9: First, They Qualify
At times, though, choosing the first qualifying position isn’t bad. For example, 
if a cloud just happens to float over the track at the right time, cooling the 
track’s surface, a driver may get a fast lap. But if that cloud floats quickly 
away, the next driver may be out of luck. That’s how delicate a situation it 
is — the passing clouds can and do make the difference between winning the 
pole and starting 20th.
The Moment of Truth: Racing 
the Qualifying Lap
Drivers take one or two qualifying laps, depending on which track they’re 
on. They each get one lap of warm-up on the track before they take the green 
flag at the start/finish line. At that point, the car, with a transmitter attached 
to its fuel cell, runs over a sensor in the track to start the timed lap. During 
the lap, a driver pushes the car as much as he dares, hoping the tires have 
enough traction and stick to the track — and hoping the car doesn’t spin out 
and crash. It’s quite a relief when it’s all over and the car zooms over that 
sensor again to end the lap. Sometimes we drivers joke about holding our 
breath during the entire lap. Following a qualifying run, as well as at other 
times during the weekend, cars have to go back through inspection. (For 
more information on inspection procedures, see Chapter 6.)
Daytona is different
Instead of holding a single round of qualifying, 
NASCAR does things differently for the Daytona 
500, the sport’s season-opening event. The 
Daytona 500 is considered NASCAR’s Super 
Bowl. For that race, drivers have several rounds 
of qualifying — but not all of them are held the 
usual way.
Unlike at other events, the contest for the pres-
tigious Daytona 500 pole position is held a week 
before the actual race. Drivers complete two laps 
around the speedway, but only the fastest two 
drivers lock in their Daytona 500 starting spots.
Four days later, all drivers run in one of two 
qualifying races, called the Gatorade Duels, 
which are each 60 laps (150 miles) long. (Even if 
the pole winner and outside pole winner finish 
last in their Duel, they still “own” the first two 
starting spots in the Daytona 500.) At the end 
of the Gatorade Duel qualifying races, all spots 
are set for the Daytona 500. As with other races, 
the field consists of 35 guaranteed starters plus 
8 others.
After the Duels are completed, just as in normal 
qualifying, any guaranteed starters not in the 
field will be inserted into the lineup. Next come 
either one or two of the highest finishing non-
guaranteed starters from each of the Duels to 
bring the field to 40 cars. Positions 41 and 42 are 
filled by the next fastest times from the original 
qualifying not already in the race, as is position 
43, unless it is required by a past champion.

Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
After qualifying ends, cars are ranked by the speed recorded by NASCAR 
officials, who score all the races and time all the qualifying laps with sophisti-
cated, high-tech equipment. The driver with the fastest lap starts the race on 
the inside of the front row, or the pole position. If two cars log the exact same 
qualifying time, the car highest in the NASCAR owner points standings starts 
from the pole. A double-car lineup means the third-fastest car lines up behind 
the pole sitter and the fourth-fastest behind the car on the outside of the 
front row, and so on throughout the field. Remember: Only the top 35 teams 
in owner points are guaranteed a spot in the race regardless of their quali-
fying times. The remaining eight race entries are determined by the times 
recorded in qualifying.
Banking on a Guaranteed 
Starting Position
 
NASCAR has a built-in safety valve for regular week-to-week teams that have a 
bad qualifying weekend. These are known as guaranteed starting positions.
How the champion’s provisionals got started
Champions haven’t always had special pro-
visionals set aside for them. NASCAR insti-
tuted the champion’s provisional in 1989 when 
the king of the sport, Richard Petty, failed to 
make a NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Richmond 
International Raceway. It was a shocking day 
for fans, drivers, and crew members to see 
NASCAR’s winningest driver fail to make the 
cut. NASCAR officials devised a system to 
prevent something like that from happening 
again, instituting champion’s provisionals the 
next year so that drivers who had reached the 
pinnacle of the sport could make every race, 
even when they had poor qualifying days. Right 
away, it was dubbed the “Petty Rule.”
Champion’s provisionals worked flawlessly for 
several years until former champion Darrell 
Waltrip went home from the UAW-GM Quality 
500 in 1997 because former champ Terry 
Labonte used the provisional because he was 
a more recent champion than Waltrip. In 1998 
Waltrip ended up using 20 champion’s pro-
visionals in 33 races. It was supposed to be 
an occasional fall-back for a past champion, 
something used rarely and in an emergency. 
So NASCAR changed the rule once again at 
the beginning of 2004, this time stating that each 
champion would be limited to ten provisionals 
per year. The number of past champion’s provi-
sionals was decreased once again in 2007, this 
time to six.

129
 Chapter 9: First, They Qualify
If a team in the top 35 in owner points does not qualify in one of the top 43 
positions, that team is inserted into the lineup. All top 35 teams are inserted 
into the lineup based on their qualifying times, with the slowest taking the 
42nd position, the next slowest 41st, and so on until all guaranteed starters 
are in the field. A corresponding number of teams outside the top 35 are 
removed from the lineup. In other words, teams that have a high qualifying 
speed but are not in the top 35 in owner points may not make the field.
After all the lineup assignments are made, a past champion who is still not in 
the field would be assigned the 43rd position. This is known as the past cham-
pions provisional. If more than one past champion is in this situation, the 
spot goes to the most recent champion. If it’s not used by a past champion, 
the 43rd position is assigned to the next eligible car owner, which would be 
the fastest of the cars that were removed from the field to make room for the 
guaranteed starters.

n stock-car racing, there’s no such thing as drawing up a precise game 
plan before a race starts — a set, preplanned strategy gets you nowhere. 
Racing changes by the minute — or even by the second — with caution flags 
coming out because of accidents, blown tires, mechanical failures, debris, 
and even rain. It would be silly to devise a plan before a race when that plan 
may be useless the minute something unexpected happens.
 
Strategy, however, is still very important as the race unfolds. For example, 
when drivers take a pit stop near the end of the race, teams have to figure 
out whether to change two tires or four, depending on whether they want to 
gain track position (with a faster two-tire stop) or have the best tires (with a 
slower, four-tire stop) in order to have the fastest possible car after the race 
resumes. Or if a race has gone green for a long time near the end of the race 
(the race has been under a green flag, without a caution flag coming out — see 
Chapter 6), teams may tell their drivers to conserve fuel by easing off the gas. 
They do that because they think their drivers may be able to avoid having to 
make another pit stop before the race is over. Also, on superspeedways (see 
Chapter 14), drivers have to know how to use the technique of drafting if they 
want to go fast and win.
In this chapter, I discuss these and other racing strategies.

Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
Perfecting the Art of Passing
One of the most obvious strategies in NASCAR racing is to pass as many cars 
as you can by coming up on either the right or left side of the car in front of 
you (see Figure 10-1). But passing during a race isn’t like driving around a 
slow car on the highway. Even if the driver is trying to pass someone on the 
straight, wide part of the track, it may be difficult because the target doesn’t 
want anyone to pass him. And that driver will do all he can to stay in front.
 
Figure 10-1: 
Even on a 
straight-
away, 
passing 
another car 
can be 
difficult.
 
Depending on the track and
conditions, the easiest pass
may be on the left (inside)
or the right (outside).

133
 Chapter 10: Passing, Draf ting, and Other Race Day Strategies
Waiting for a passing chance
 
Making a pass is much more strenuous than it may seem, especially if the car 
a driver is trying to pass is on the lead lap or if he’s battling for position. Being 
on the lead lap means that a driver has completed the same number of laps as 
the leader. (If the driver is a lap down, that means he has completed one less 
lap than the leader.) Battling for position means the car that the driver is trying 
to pass is on the same lap as the driver. For example, a driver is battling for posi-
tion with a car ahead of him when he’s in fourth place and that car is in third.
The driver being passed is probably going to try to block, meaning he will try 
to put his car exactly where he thinks another driver is going to try to pass 
him. That requires plenty of concentration and plenty of glances into the 
rearview mirror, but when a driver knows how to throw a good block, even 
the best cars can’t get by him. When a driver tries to pass another car, he has 
to be patient and stay right on the bumper of the car in front.
Passes frequently occur in the turns, where cars tend to become difficult to 
drive — and easy for other cars to pass — particularly if the car in front isn’t 
set up correctly. If a driver can’t zoom by and easily pass, he has to wait for 
the driver in front of him to make a mistake, even a small one, in order to 
get by. This mistake may happen when the driver of the car in front takes a 
turn too wide (see Figure 10-2) and slides up the track when coming out of a 
turn. Or it can happen when that driver takes his car into a turn too quickly 
and loses control for a split-second. Turns — especially their entry and exit 
points — are good places to make a move.
Bumping your way forward
 
At short tracks, passing isn’t as much of an art as it is a technique. Cars at 
short tracks are going relatively slow, and there is plenty of downforce — 
which means the cars stick to the track — so drivers can be very aggressive 
without causing a big accident. In order to pass a car in front, the driver 
doesn’t necessarily have to go below him or above him on the track. All he has 
to do is give the car a tap — called a bump — on the rear bumper, as Figure 
10-3 shows. Most of the time that causes the car to float up the track and give 
the other driver enough room to pass.

Passing the slow pokes
 
The driver in the lead wants to get as much space between him and the 
second-place car as possible, which becomes a problem — and a big pain in 
the neck — when the leader comes up on lapped traffic. Lapped traffic is a 
bunch of cars that have fallen off the lead lap either because they’re consider-
ably slower than the leaders or because they’ve had problems or penalties. 

135
 Chapter 10: Passing, Draf ting, and Other Race Day Strategies
So when the leader is trucking around the speedway, the last thing he needs 
is a bunch of slower cars getting in his way. This is when the blue flag with a 
diagonal yellow stripe comes into play, cautioning all cars not on the lead lap 
to look out for those cars that are on the lead lap. (See Chapter 6 for more on 
flags.) It’s sort of like driving in the fast lane on the highway and having to slow 
down when there’s a slow car ahead of you that just won’t switch lanes. You 
could pass on the right, but what if another slow car is in the right lane? You’re 
stuck behind those cars until one or both of them decide to move out of the 
way. Drivers have the same problem in racing. When the lead car gets caught 
behind lapped traffic, the driver in second — who has no one ahead of him to 
slow him down — has more time to catch up to the leader’s back bumper.

technique 
is brutally

136

On the other hand, if the lead driver can pass the lapped car just before going 
into a turn, the second-place car gets stuck behind the lapped car (see 
Figure 10-4).

Staying on the lead lap
Sometimes lapped cars aren’t that much slower than the lead cars. They 
may have blown a tire, spun out, or been penalized for speeding on pit road 
or doing something else illegal earlier in the race. Those drivers want to get 
back on the lead lap so that they can have a chance to win. If they can get 
back on the lead lap, these drivers have a chance at a good finish, especially 
if a caution flag comes out. As much as they want to return to the front of 
the field, however, drivers who are a lap or more down usually still follow a 
“gentleman’s agreement,” allowing a driver in contention for the victory the 
right of way.
Under a caution flag (see Chapter 6 for the lowdown on the different flags), all 
the cars on the lead lap are bunched up single-file, almost bumper to bumper, 
behind the pace car. Even if the lead car had a substantial edge over the sec-
ond-place car, or if the last car on the lead lap was looking at the leader in his 
rearview mirror and about to get lapped, everyone’s brought together under 
the great equalizing caution flag. So if you’re on the lead lap, you always have 
hope to get up near the front.
 
The problem is getting on the lead lap if you’re a lap or two down. Here are 
some ways a driver can get back on the lead lap:
 
✓ Pass the leader under green-flag conditions. Sometimes a driver may 
be a lap down only because his tire went flat or he ran out of gas — not 
because he has a slow car. In that case, that driver may be fast enough 
to pass the leaders and get back on the lead lap.
 
✓ Stay on the track when the leaders make a pit stop under the green flag. 
And then hope that something causes a caution flag so that you can pit 
when cars are moving around the track slowly. That gives you enough 
time to make a pit stop and then catch up to the tail end of the field. If 
you pit when everybody else does, it’s hard to gain position, and you’ll 
still be a lap down.
 
✓ Be designated the “Lucky Dog” driver. The Beneficiary Rule — also 
known as the Lucky Dog Rule — provides that each time there is a cau-
tion, the first driver one lap down gets an automatic pass up to the end 
of the lead lap. The Beneficiary Rule is not in effect when there are less 
than ten laps remaining.
 
✓ Have teammates or friends on the track. Sometimes one driver lets 
another driver get his laps back by letting the driver who is a lap down 
pass the driver who’s on the lead lap. It all depends on how the lead-lap 
driver feels about the other driver. If they’re friends, teammates, or if 
they’ve worked well with each other in the past, the lead-lap driver may 
let the other driver pass. If they’re not friends and have had previous on-
track problems, you can bet that the driver who’s down a lap isn’t going 
to be able to pass. It’s like slowing down to let someone into your lane 
on the highway or on a road; it kind of depends on what mood you’re in.

138
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
Relying on the Spotter
Unlike passenger cars, race cars don’t have sideview mirrors. So passing 
another car when you’re going 180 mph and running inches away from the 
cars in front of and behind you aren’t the easiest things to do. That’s why 
teams have spotters perched high above the race track.
 
A spotter is a team member who watches a race from atop the press box or the 
grandstands where he can get a full view of the race track. His job is to be the 
driver’s second set of eyes. As soon as the spotter sees there’s enough room 
for a driver to pass another car, he tells the driver, “Clear high!” or “Clear low!” 
which means, “There are no cars on the high side of the track (the part closest 
to the grandstands)” or “There are no cars on the low side of the track (the 
part closest to the infield).” A driver knows he’s clear to move around the track 
in those areas and pass cars.
Although drivers use spotters at every race, spotters are absolutely indispens-
able at certain tracks in the series. At short tracks, for example, drivers are 
lapping the track so fast, they can’t even tell where they are at times — and 
they don’t have a lot of time to avoid accidents. So, at places like the half-
mile Bristol Motor Speedway, where it takes cars only about 15 seconds to 
go around the track, spotters need to stay alert and notify their drivers of 
accidents as soon as they happen. If the spotters aren’t quick enough, their 
drivers may become a part of the wreck, too. The same thing goes for super-
speedways, where cars run in excess of 180 mph just a few feet, or even inches, 
apart. For example, if an accident happens at the top of the race track coming 
out of turn four, the spotter notifies the driver and tells him whether to go low 
or high on the track to avoid it. (See Chapter 9 for an explanation of the turns 
on the track.)
At the bigger tracks, such as the 2.66-mile Talladega Superspeedway, every 
team has more than one spotter. One usually sits above the frontstretch and 
one above the backstretch because one spotter can’t see the entire track, 
even from a high vantage point. The same is true at Indianapolis and the 
Watkins Glen road course. Sometimes a team may use several spotters, with 
each one taking responsibility for a certain section of the track.
From time to time, spotters communicate with people other than those on 
their team. If a spotter is working with a driver who is leading the race and 
coming up on a lapped car, he may walk over to the lapped car’s spotter and 
tell him to ask that driver to move over. The spotter then relays the other 
driver’s request, but that driver doesn’t necessarily have to move over if he 
doesn’t want to. It all depends on the relationship between those two driv-
ers. If they’ve worked well together before, maybe the lapped car will give 
the leader a break — possibly hoping the driver will remember the favor in 
the future. At superspeedways, where cars go faster when they work together 

139
 Chapter 10: Passing, Draf ting, and Other Race Day Strategies
than they do separately, a spotter may make a deal with another spotter to get 
two drivers to work together and draft to the front. (See the section “There’s a 
Draft in Here,” later in this chapter, for more information on drafting.)
Using Your Driving Style 
to Get an Advantage
Not every driver is aggressive from the start of the race to the finish. Some 
like to zoom to the front as soon as the green flag drops; others like to hang 
behind the leaders. It all depends on the race they’re in, the race track 
they’re on, and their race strategy.
Saving your engine
 
In a long race such as the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe’s Motor Speedway, drivers 
don’t like to push their cars and engines too hard at the beginning. They know 
it’s wiser to conserve the car for when they’ll need it most, which is the last 
50 to 100 laps. If you push the car too hard at the beginning of the race, you 
risk blowing an engine — which means you won’t finish the race because your 
engine fails beyond immediate repair. It’s amazing how often an engine blows 
during that last 100 miles of the Coca-Cola 600 because the driver pushed it 
too hard throughout the race.
Sometimes the configuration of a particular track can wear on an engine. 
Blown engines are common at Pocono Raceway because the sharp turns 
of the triangular track cause frequent and severe accelerating and braking, 
which put a lot of strain on an engine.
Taking care of your tires
One reason drivers don’t go full-bore around a track all the time is that 
they must take care of their tires. There’s no question that the tires used in 
NASCAR races are sturdy: Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company creates tires 
for each race track and works hard to devise tires that last longer during a 
race and don’t blister, pop, or go flat easily. But making the perfect tire for a 
certain track is tough. If the tire is too hard, drivers complain that it’s hard to 
drive. If it’s too soft, the tire can pop easily.

140
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
 
The point is that tires aren’t indestructible. Drivers must be careful not to 
wear out their tires too quickly during a race. This is called tire management. 
At sandpaper-rough tracks such as Indianapolis Motor Speedway, drivers 
make sure not to push their cars too fast through the turns because the tires 
wear out more quickly. Even on smoother tracks, tires don’t last very long, 
so drivers take it easy when they can. Otherwise, the tires may wear out and 
provide less traction, which means the car will be more difficult to control. 
When tires wear out or suddenly go flat, the driver can end up in the infield, 
up against the outside wall, or flying down the track.
Drivers also run the risk of blowing tires if they wear them down too much, 
which can create dangerous situations. Figure 10-5 shows what can happen 
when a right front tire blows: The car is carried to the outside wall unless the 
driver can get the car under control.

Going easy on the brakes
Brakes can become a problem — a dangerous problem — at short tracks 
because the turns are so tight that drivers have to brake hard to keep from 
hitting the wall, especially if they enter the turn too hard. A small track also 
means that drivers have to brake more frequently. That’s a lot of extra strain 
on the brakes, which wears them down faster.
To prepare for tracks like Martinsville Speedway, where races last 500 laps 
around the .526-mile oval, mechanics put extra-thick brake pads and extra-
durable brake parts on their cars. And drivers make sure to conserve their 
brakes when they can — especially early in a race when driving aggressively 
usually doesn’t pay off.
Bringing a spare
Every team brings more than one car to the race track, just in case the driver 
crashes one of them irreparably. The best car for that track is the primary car, 
which is the car a driver starts out driving during a race weekend. If something 
happens to that car, however, a team must unload the backup car from the 
truck. This situation is never a good sign for a team because the backup car 
isn’t the first choice for the driver to use at that race track. It’s usually another 
car out of the team’s fleet of about a dozen at the race shop — a car used on 
tracks similar to the one they’re at. But the backup car isn’t set up exactly like 
the primary car. And if the driver crashes the backup car, too, he may be in 
trouble at another race track — the track where the backup car was supposed 
to be the primary car.
After a race starts, teams can use only one car: the one they started with. 
Backup cars come into play only if the primary car has an accident in prac-
tice or qualifying.
Here’s another problem with using a backup car: If a team goes to a backup 
car after qualifying, it has to start the race from the rear of the field.
Employing Pit Stop Strategies
Pit stops play the greatest role in race strategy. When do you pit? When do 
you stay on the track? When should you come in for a splash-and-go? When 
should you make an air pressure adjustment in the tires — and which tires 
should you change — in order to get the car handling better? It’s the crew 

142
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
chief’s job to make those decisions, which puts a lot of pressure on him, 
especially in the final laps when his driver is contending for the victory. A 
good pit stop can get the driver out in front; a bad one can cost the driver a 
victory. (See Chapter 11 for a lot more on pit stops.)
 
The most important result of a pit stop is track position — a car’s position in 
relation to the front of the pack. A team can improve its car’s track position if 
it has a quicker pit stop than the teams that came into the pits ahead of it.
Tire gambles
Drivers can improve their track positions by changing only two tires instead 
of four during a pit stop. The few extra seconds gained gets them out on the 
track while other drivers are still on pit road. But changing just two tires 
instead of all four is a gamble. Although a two-tire stop is several seconds 
shorter than a four-tire stop, a driver may not be as fast on the track as a 
driver who took four tires. Older tires don’t provide as much traction — 
meaning the car doesn’t stick to the track as well. The gamble is in estimat-
ing how much slower the car will be. If you get out of the pit stop first after 
taking on two tires with ten laps left, and the driver who takes on four tires 
is 10th, perhaps those four new tires will make him so fast that he’ll catch up 
to you before the race is over. It’s a guessing game that depends on the track 
and how the team prepared the car for the race. Many times, crew chiefs 
won’t commit to two or four tires until the last second. They watch the other 
leading cars on pit road to see how many tires they’re getting before making 
their own decisions.
 
Another question that arises is whether to use sticker tires or scuffs. Sticker 
tires are new tires that still have the manufacturer’s sticker on them. Scuffs 
have been previously mounted on the car and “scuffed” on the track surface 
during practice for a lap or two. Each affect the handling of a race car in 
different ways, depending on the weather and the temperature of the race 
track. Crew chiefs are better able to predict how scuffed tires will perform, as 
they already have practice miles on them, but sticker tires are usually more 
dependable.
S
 
Tires affect a race car’s handling more than you may think. That’s why drivers 
often state during a race (over the in-car radio) that they don’t like a particu-
lar set of tires. For some reason, the tires don’t work well together, perhaps 
because of a miniscule imbalance between them. This mismatched set of tires 
may make the car more difficult to turn, or they may make the car feel wiggly 
in the rear-end as it goes though the turns. The foremost thing on a driver’s 
mind then is getting back into the pits for a new, better set.

143
 Chapter 10: Passing, Draf ting, and Other Race Day Strategies
Fuel and mileage gambles
Fuel mileage isn’t an issue in all races — only the ones where there aren’t 
many caution flags. Long periods of green-flag racing mean that cars are on 
the track until they need gas instead of staying on the track until there’s an 
accident. (An accident allows all drivers to make a pit stop while cars are 
slowed on the track during the cleanup.)
Michigan International Speedway, which traditionally has long green-flag 
runs, is a track where fuel mileage is often an issue. With fewer caution laps, 
tanks quickly run dry.
Drivers need to get as many laps from one tank of fuel as they can, in order 
to utilize every last drop of gas in their tanks. If they consistently get good 
mileage out of each tank of gas, they may not have to make as many pit 
stops as the next driver — meaning they’ll have a better chance at winning. 
Sometimes a driver may drive slower to conserve gas, pushing the fuel mile-
age as far as it will go and hoping he can make it to the finish without running 
out of gas. However, if a late-race caution flag goes up because of an accident 
or debris on the track, all that fuel mileage calculation goes out the window 
because all the cars come into the pits for more gas.
 
Teams figure out their fuel mileage before a race begins, determining how 
many laps the car can make around the track before it runs out of gas. They 
then decide on a pit window, which is when they’ll need to make a pit stop to 
refuel. At some tracks, the pit window may be 40 to 50 laps; at others it may be 
70 to 125 laps. It all depends on the length of the track.
Running on empty
Even though crew chiefs, engineers, and 
team members figure out how many laps they 
can get out of one tank before a race begins, 
sometimes they make mistakes. In 1998, Dale 
Jarrett paid dearly for that type of mistake. 
Jarrett was leading the Brickyard 400, and his 
team thought he could make it just beyond the 
halfway point before making a pit stop. They 
wanted to lead the race at halfway in order to 
pick up the $10,000 bonus. The gamble wasn’t 
worth the $10,000, though, when Jarrett ran out 
of gas on the backstretch of the huge, 2.5-mile 
track. Obviously, he lost his lead in a hurry while 
coasting back to pit road — but his car didn’t 
make it all the way to his pit stall. It stopped just 
at the entrance to pit road, which was quite an 
unfortunate place to come to a halt because his 
pit stall was all the way at the other end of pit 
road. His crew had to run down pit road to the 
car so they could push it back to their pit box. 
They started out sprinting, but, because it was 
a good half-mile to the car, the crew came back 
huffing and puffing. Jarrett lost several laps 
and finished 16th, losing the $1 million bonus he 
could have won for finishing first.

144
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
Obviously, teams don’t want their cars to run out of gas — so they have a 
system of keeping tabs on the situation. To calculate their fuel mileage, they 
weigh the gas can when it’s full and then again after a pit stop to find out how 
much gas is left in the can and the catch can (which catches the overflow of 
gas) after a pit stop. (Flip to Chapter 11 for more on pit stops.) The gas in the 
cans reveals how much gas was dumped into the gas tank — which, in turn, 
reveals how long the car can go without sputtering and stopping. While this 
sounds like an exact science, it isn’t. For one reason or another, cars can run 
out of gas in the final laps of a race, even when a team thinks it has enough 
gas to last much longer.

as if he was about to win for the first time in his rookie year. What he didn’t 
expect — especially after dominating the race — was his car to run out of gas 
with just two laps to go. Jeff Burton ended up winning instead. It happens to 
the best of us, including me a few times. After a while, though, you realize that 
you lose some races that way and you win some that way. For example, Jeff 
Gordon was leading the 1999 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race by nearly half a lap 
at Lowe’s Motor Speedway, but he ran out of gas with one lap to go. I was in 
second place at the time and couldn’t have been happier to hear the news on 
my radio. The next thing I knew, I was in Victory Lane celebrating a surprise 
win while Gordon was steaming over the loss (and the lack of gas in his car).
 
If there’s a caution late in the race, and if a team thinks that after the caution 
flag is lifted the race will be under a green flag until the end, you may see a 
car dive onto pit road just before the green flag is raised again. This is called 
a splash-and-go stop — a pit stop in which the pit crew members don’t change 
tires; instead, they just fill the gas tank with a smidgen of fuel before the driver 
peels back out onto the track. Teams do this when they think that without that 
small additional amount of fuel, their cars will run out of gas. It’s better to lose 
a lap or two than to run out of gas on the track and lose several laps or possi-
bly not finish.
There’s a Draft in Here
Do you know what it feels like to cruise right behind a semi-truck on the high-
way and feel like the truck is pulling you forward? But then when you try to 
pass it, your car bounces all around because of the air flowing off the front, 
back, and sides of the truck? This pull of the truck on your car is called drafting.
 
Drafting is a very important strategy on superspeedways and some of the larger 
intermediate tracks that are so large and have turns so sweeping that aerody-
namics, or the way air flows over a car, greatly influences how well a car does. 
(For more on aerodynamics and superspeedways, turn to Chapter 14.) In racing, 

145
 Chapter 10: Passing, Draf ting, and Other Race Day Strategies
drafting occurs when drivers share airflow among them by racing in single file. 
The first car in line punches an imaginary hole in the air, and the cars behind 
it slip more easily through that hole. Thus their engines don’t have to work as 
hard to battle oncoming air. The car in front benefits, too. It gets “pushed” by 
the cars behind it. Figure 10-6 demonstrates how drafting works.
 
Figure 10-6: 
Under-
standing the 
way that air 
flows over 
and under a 
car is key to 
success at 
superspeed-
ways.
 
 
The line of cars racing down the track in single file is known as the draft. The 
first group of cars going single file is called the lead draft. If a driver loses the 
draft and has to race by himself with no other cars around — or if he acciden-
tally falls out of the single-file line — he’s in big trouble because his car is so 
much slower. That goes to show you that, at superspeedways, drivers need 
help from other drivers in order to get around the track in the quickest way.
Dale Earnhardt was known as the master of superspeedways because, as 
legend has it, he could “see” air flowing off the car ahead of him. Drivers need 
this sixth sense to make smart, thought-out moves on a superspeedway in 
order to win.
Making a pass at a superspeedway takes a special skill because of the drafting 
aspect. It’s not like passing a car at short or intermediate tracks, where you 
can roar past someone through a turn or tap the rear bumper of a car to try 
to move it up the track. Try that at a superspeedway, and you’ll probably send 
that car flying into the wall or spinning around and cause a major accident — 
cars run too fast for that sort of trick. Instead, in order to pass someone, a 
driver has to team up with one or more other drivers because two or more 
cars go faster together than they do separately.

146
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
Suppose a driver dives to the inside of the track to pass the leader, and the 
driver behind him follows. Both drivers most likely will draft past the leader 
because they are pushing and pulling each other through the pass and prob-
ably leaving the leader with no one directly behind him to push him on.
 
The tricky part of this scenario is that a driver can never be sure whether 
another driver is going to follow him when he makes a move. His spotter 
can make all the deals he wants with another spotter (see the “Relying on 
the Spotter” section, earlier in this chapter) in order to convince another 
driver to team up with his driver to pass the leader. The problem is, these 
impromptu deals are never guaranteed. The risk is that the driver dives out 
of the draft to the inside, and no one backs him up. This situation is called 
getting hung out to dry. No car is ahead of him; no car is behind him. He has no 
draft. Now the entire line of cars in the draft may pass him because he’s running 
much more slowly.
At superspeedways it’s not unusual to see a driver go from first to tenth if 
he’s hung out to dry. It’s also not unusual to see drivers struggling to get 
back in line after they’ve fallen out of line and lost the draft. Cars run so close 
together, there isn’t much room to squeeze in, and most of the time, your 
competitors show no mercy. Still, every driver tries desperately to get back 
into line and back into the draft. If he falls too far back, though, he may lose 
the lead draft altogether. In that case, he’s doomed unless he catches up to 
the pack (which isn’t likely unless he has help from other cars) or a caution 
flag comes out to bunch the cars back together.
 
A slingshot move is a special technique drivers use to pass cars on super-
speedways, but only experienced, savvy drivers have enough guts to try it and 
enough talent to do it successfully. A driver has to utilize the air flowing off 
the car ahead of him very carefully, allowing his car to get sucked in by that 
car (see Figure 10-7). The driver then turns abruptly to one side or the other 
and gets shot through the air right by the car he is trying to pass. The catch 
is, the driver making the move has to know exactly where to position his car 
before and as he makes the pass. For the move to work, he must use the air 
flowing off the opposing car to his advantage. While the move doesn’t work as 
well today as it did in the days before carburetor restrictor plates, which slow 
the cars down, Dale Earnhardt, the superspeedway guru, was known to pull it 
off from time to time. (Turn to Chapter 14 for more on restrictor-plate racing.)

Coping with Accidents
No matter how careful drivers are during a race, accidents happen. Sometimes 
drivers lose control of their cars. Sometimes they blow a tire. Sometimes they 
blow an engine, and the car behind them slips in the oil they dropped and 
spins out. Sometimes two cars inadvertently touch coming out of a turn and 
send each other reeling into incoming traffic. Sometimes a driver hits another 
car’s back bumper and sends that car flying. You can never tell when it will 
happen next. All you can do is hope you miss the mayhem.
When at all possible, the spotter alerts the driver to an accident and tells 
him where to go on the track to avoid it. But sometimes if smoke is billowing 
into the air, neither the spotter nor the driver can see anything. So the best 
technique in that situation is for a driver to grit his teeth and hope to make it 
through unscathed. While it’s not failsafe, there’s often nothing else a driver 
can do.
 
Sometimes, though, drivers can see an accident in the making and avoid it 
before it happens. Maybe a car isn’t really stable as it comes out of the turns 
and its back end is wobbling. Maybe a driver is taking too many chances by 
cutting off cars and coming close to the wall. Or maybe one car is riding too 
close to the back of another car and disturbs the airflow off the car in front. 
Instead of the air flowing onto the lead car’s spoiler, it flows off the first car 
and onto the second car’s front end. That leaves the lead car with little rear-
end downforce, meaning it doesn’t have much traction or control of its back 
end. This is called taking the air off another car’s spoiler, and it often ends in 
the lead car spinning out and getting into an accident — and sometimes taking 
out other cars with it (see Figure 10-8).

▶ Looking at the role of each pit crew member
▶ Knowing the rules of making a pit stop
▶ Determining when to make pit stops
T
he car that wins the race isn’t necessarily the fastest one on the track. 
Many other factors go into making it to Victory Lane. One of the most 
important components is efficient pit stops.
A bad pit stop can cost a driver valuable time on the track. Wasting even one 
second during a pit stop can mean the difference between winning and losing, 
especially when races are frequently won by just fractions of a second.
In this chapter, I run down all the elements of an effective pit stop.
Watching a Pit Stop in Action
 
You can’t drive several hundred miles without stopping for gas with the small 
fuel tanks used in race cars. A pit stop occurs when a driver pulls off the race 
track and into the pits so the over-the-wall members of his crew can service 
his car with gas, change tires, and make mechanical repairs or adjustments to 
improve a car’s performance, especially after an accident. Several factors go 
into how often a car comes in for a pit stop, including how quickly the tires 
wear down and what kind of fuel mileage the car is getting.
Goodyear, the company that manufactures all the tires for NASCAR’s top 
series, builds racing tires to last as long as a full tank of fuel. However, some 
tires — due to track conditions such as debris — develop problems before 
the tank is empty. If tires wear down more quickly than the fuel dwindles, a 
team has to make a pit stop before the gas tank is empty.

152
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track
On the average, race cars go about 85 miles per full tank of gas, which is 17.75 
gallons. That’s a little more than five miles per gallon. (In contrast, your typi-
cal economy car gets 30 miles per gallon or more on the highway.) A stock 
car’s gas mileage varies from track to track and also depends on the driver’s 
driving style. If a driver is rough and pumps the gas pedal frequently, he gets 
worse gas mileage than a driver who is smooth and steady with the gas pedal.
Pulling off on pit road
 
When a car needs to make a pit stop, the driver pulls off on pit road, which is a 
separate road inside the race track that usually runs parallel to a track’s front-
stretch between the final turn and the first turn. Only one short track, the half-
mile Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, has two pit roads; the 43 cars are too 
many to stop on a 650-foot front row. Check out a typical pit road in Figure 11-1.
Pit road is a haven, like the shoulder on a highway, where drivers get away 
from the hectic action on the track to have their cars serviced. But that 
doesn’t mean things don’t get busy on pit road.

 Chapter 11: Making Pit Stops
 
Along pit road, pit stalls or pit boxes of equal size are marked off with yellow 
lines for each of the 43 cars in the race. A driver has to pull into the box com-
pletely to avoid receiving a penalty. (See the later section “Following the Rules 
of Pit Road” for more on pit stop penalties.) Some tracks have smaller pit 
stalls than others, depending on the size of the race track itself, so pulling in 
and out of a pit stall can be difficult business. It also can be dangerous for the 
crewmen who service the cars, as they can be bumped by a car pitting in front 
of or behind them or hit by a tire or part.
Each driver/crew chief combination has its favorite pit stall at each track. 
Jimmie Johnson and crew chief Chad Knaus, for example, prefer the pit stall 
closest to the exit of pit road. Other teams would rather have the first pit 
stall upon entering pit road. With most pit road speeds between 35 and 55 
miles per hour, some teams would rather drive slowly the length of pit road 
and exit quickly, while others prefer to stop in the first stall in an effort to 
avoid colliding with other cars heading down pit road. Pit stalls are allotted 
according to how well a team qualifies. The pole sitter gets first choice.
 
The pit wall separates the pit boxes from the area behind the wall where teams 
keep their equipment and watch the race. Usually, the crew chief sits on top of 
a box called a crash cart or war wagon, which is filled with equipment used for 
quick repairs. The rest of the team members hang out in the area, monitoring 
lap times or listening to two-way radios in order to hear their driver talk about 
the car and the race. When their car comes in for a pit stop, the seven over-the-
wall pit crew members quickly jump over the wall to service it.
Making a quick pit stop
Besides filling the car with gas and changing the tires, members of a pit crew 
quickly perform the following tasks (see Figure 11-2):
 
✓ Repair the body of a car after an accident, as long as it didn’t sustain 
major damage.
 
✓ Fix a broken component on the car if it doesn’t require a major overhaul.
 
✓ Clean the grille.
 
✓ Remove a tear-off (a layer of thin plastic film) from the front windshield 
to improve the driver’s view. This procedure has replaced washing the 
window with a squeegee.
 
✓ Make adjustments on the car to improve the handling.
 
✓ Give the driver a bottle of water.

If a driver says his car is handling terribly, the pit crew makes adjustments 
to the car during a pit stop. Usually you see the rear tire carrier insert a long 
ratchet, which is similar to a wrench, into a hole on the rear window of the car. 
He cranks the ratchet one way or the other to change the pressure on one of 
the rear springs in order to improve the handling. (This process is called put-
ting in or taking out rounds of wedge.) A team also can change a car’s handling 
by adjusting the air pressure in the tires, raising or lowering the sway bar, 
or raising or lowering the track bar. (See Chapter 5 for descriptions of these 
parts of a car.)
A pit crew accomplishes many tasks in a short time. A good pit stop can take 
as little as 14 seconds — not much time, considering the crew changes four tires 
and fills a 17.75-gallon gas tank. If there’s the smallest of problems — say the tire 
changer fumbles the air wrench — the stop may last 17 or 18 seconds, and the 
driver will undoubtedly lose a number of positions because other drivers behind 
him completed their stops in 14 seconds and got out ahead of him.
There are several types of pit stops, including these four:
 
✓ A four-tire stop: The crew changes all four tires and fills the gas tank.
 
✓ A two-tire stop: The team changes just two tires, usually the two 
right-side tires.
 
✓ A gas-and-go: The team adds gas to the car but doesn’t change any tires.
 
✓ A splash-and-go: The team adds just enough gas to make it to the end of 
the race.

155
 Chapter 11: Making Pit Stops
All pit crews film their stops and review the tape as soon as their car rejoins 
the race so that they can see what they did correctly and what they did wrong.
Going behind the wall
 
A driver also makes a pit stop whenever his team needs to repair his car after 
an accident or mechanical problem. If the team has to make major repairs 
to the car, including substantial repairs to the engine or suspension or to 
replace major pieces of sheet metal or parts, NASCAR rules say the team must 
perform those repairs behind the wall. Going behind the wall means leaving 
pit road and going into a safe area in the infield or garage where the crew can 
work on the car and repair it. Also, if the car is leaking fluids, a driver usually 
brings it behind the wall so that the car doesn’t completely mess up pit road.
Pit Crews: Ballet Dancers in Firesuits
While the pit crew performing a pit stop looks smooth and choreographed, 
the moves aren’t easy. Crews spend as much as one hour a day practicing 
pit stops at their shop with a pit crew coach who times and videotapes their 
stops and analyzes everyone’s technique. Crews lift weights usually with 
the help of a personal trainer at a gym set up in their race shop. Being in top 
physical shape allows them to lift tires with ease and to scramble around the 
car quickly. Everybody knows that the faster the pit stop, the better chance 
the driver has of moving toward the front — and to Victory Lane.
 
While an unlimited number of crew members are allowed to wait behind the 
wall during a race, only seven can come over the pit wall to work on the car 
during a pit stop. That’s why the crew members who service the car are often 
called the over-the-wall crew. These teammates crouch atop the pit wall and 
wait for their car to come down pit road. Even before the car comes to a stop, 
the crew members jump off the wall, carrying their equipment, and scramble 
around the car to change tires, make adjustments, and fill the gas tank.
The seven crew members have specific jobs to do after they leap over the 
wall (see Figure 11-3).
 
✓ Tire changers (2): The crew has one tire changer for the front tires and 
one for the rear tires. They leap off the pit wall with air wrenches in 
their hands and rush to the right side of the car (during a four-tire stop). 
They drop to their knees (wearing knee pads) and loosen the five lug 
nuts holding the tire to the car. They take off the right tire and wheel, place 
a new tire and wheel on the car, tighten the lug nuts (which are previously 
glued onto the wheel), and then scurry to the left side to do the same thing.

156

crew mem-
bers who

a car 
during a pit 
stop. They 
change four 
tires and 
add gas in 
about 14 
seconds.
 
 
✓ Tire carriers (2): Each tire carrier hands two 55-pound tires (already 
mounted onto wheels) to the tire changers and takes the used tires away. 
When handing a fresh tire to the tire changer, the carrier is responsible 
for helping line up the tire onto the car, so that the changer can tighten 
the lug nuts right away without having to lift the tire and wheel onto the 
axle. On the way to the left side, each tire carrier rolls the used tire to a 
crew member who is waiting on the other side of the pit wall to take the 
tire away. Also, the front tire carrier sometimes cleans the grille as he 
goes past the nose of the car.
 
✓ Jackman (1): The jackman usually is one of the strongest people on the 
pit crew because he has to jump off the pit wall with a hydraulic jack 
that weighs about 35 pounds in his arms — and then use it to hoist a 
3,400-pound car off the ground. He runs to the right side of the car, posi-
tioning the jack under a specific spot (usually delineated by an arrow or 
a line), and uses the jack to lift the car off the ground. The jackman has 
to lift the car with one or two pumps of the handle, enough so that the 
tires are off the ground — weaklings wouldn’t fare too well. After raising 
the right side of the car, the jackman runs to the left side and does the 
same thing. The driver gets the signal to leave the pits when the jackman 
drops the jack and lowers the left side of the car and gives the driver a 
thumbs-up.
 
✓ Gas man (1): The gas man doesn’t have to be nimble, but he does have to 
be strong. He must step over the pit wall carrying a 90-pound, 11-gallon can 
of gas and then fill the gas tank. When the first can empties, he usually gets 
a second can from the second gas man (who doesn’t go over the wall) and 
fills the tank with that gas as well. Each can has a special valve on it so 
that the gas shoots down into the gas tank quickly. You can recognize the 

157
 Chapter 11: Making Pit Stops
gas man easily because he usually wears a helmet and a fireproof apron 
to protect him from fumes, spillage, and possible fires.
 
✓ Catch can man (1): The catch can man stands behind the car on the left 
side and holds a special container to collect gas that overflows from the 
gas tank. That keeps the gas from spilling onto the ground and possibly 
catching fire as the car takes off. He raises his hand to let the other over-
the-wall members know that they are done filling up the gas tank.
Even though only seven crew members are allowed over the wall, other 
people can help service the car — as long as they don’t step onto pit road. 
A team member may use a long pole with a squeegee or cloth on the end to 
wipe off any rubber or debris that has gathered on the car’s grille (to keep 
the car from overheating if air isn’t getting through the grille and cooling its 
engine). Another team member may use a pole with a handy basket on the 
end to hand the driver a bottle of water. Also, one team member is always 
waiting behind the wall for the tire carrier to roll the used tires over to him. If 
he doesn’t catch that tire, it could mean a penalty for the team.
Until recent years, a crew member also used to wash and squeegee the wind-
shield with a long pole from behind the pit wall. But stock-car windshields 
now come equipped with several layers of a thin plastic film. Each layer is 
called a tear-off because that’s what a crew member does to give the driver a 
nice, new, clear windshield.
Hiring Pit Crews
Some over-the-wall pit crews are regular members of the team: mechanics, 
crew chiefs, car chiefs, or truck drivers. Others are specially hired employees 
who fly to the track on race day solely to pit the car. Some team owners don’t 
want to risk using regular team members to pit the car because they may be 
tired from working on the car all weekend or they just aren’t athletic enough. 
Being a good pit crew member takes special skill, agility, and physical fitness, 
which makes these guys hot commodities in the garage. They have to try out 
and show their talents in order to get a job.
Following are some of the qualities that make a good candidate for an over-
the-wall pit crew member:
 
✓ Agility to maneuver around a car when six other over-the-wall pit crew 
members are trying to do the same thing.
 
✓ Strength to carry heavy tires or to pump the jack handle and hoist the 
car off the ground.
 
✓ Fast reaction time to loosen the lug nuts on a wheel without hesitation.
 
✓ Ability to remain calm under pressure, even when winning a race is on 
the line.

158
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track
 
✓ Excellent hand–eye coordination, especially for the tire changers.
 
✓ The ability to remain focused when people are screaming and cars are 
zooming by just inches away.
Following the Rules of Pit Road
Just like everything else in racing, rules and more rules govern pit stops. 
NASCAR officials, sitting above the track in the control tower, monitor cars 
as they travel down pit road. Each team also has an official standing in its pit, 
watching as crew members performs the pit stop to make sure it’s all done 
legally. If it’s not, the official penalizes them.
Slow down: Speeding penalties
While speeding on the race track goes with the territory, speeding on pit road 
doesn’t. A driver can’t just drive like a maniac coming off the race track and 
onto pit road. Although that’s what drivers used to do, NASCAR now has a rule 
that limits the speed on pit road, to protect the crews working on the cars.
 
The speed limit on pit road ranges from 35 to 55 miles per hour, depending on 
the size of the speedway. But drivers can’t look at their speedometers to make 
sure they aren’t speeding because they don’t have them — instead they have 
tachometers, which measure the number of revolutions per minute that the 
engine is turning. During a pace lap, a pace car drives the pit road speed while 
the drivers behind the pace car look at their tachometers to check how many 
rpm (revolutions per minute) they’re turning. When a driver later crosses the 
line that begins pit road during a race, he checks his tachometer to make sure 
it reads the same as it did during the pace lap.
 
When a driver is caught speeding while coming down pit road under green-flag 
conditions, NASCAR officials direct him to “pass through pit road” on his next 
lap as a penalty. If NASCAR officials in the control tower catch him speeding 
during a pit stop, he has to come down pit road again for a stop-and-go penalty, 
which means that he has to come back to his pit box another time and stop 
before heading back on the race track. If a driver speeds down pit road under a 
caution, he has to start on the tail of the longest line on the restart. The worst 
penalty is when NASCAR docks a driver a lap or two, meaning he has to stay in 
the pits while other drivers continue to complete laps around the track.
NASCAR generally checks for speeding on pit road with a stopwatch, check-
ing the amount of time it takes for a car to go from one predetermined spot 
on pit road to another. NASCAR officials already know ahead of time that it 
will take, for example, three seconds for a car going the speed limit to travel 

159
 Chapter 11: Making Pit Stops
between the two points. If NASCAR officials time a car and the stopwatch 
shows less than three seconds, they know the car is speeding, and they 
throw the black flag on that car.
Other pit road no-nos
NASCAR has a list of other no-nos regarding pit stops during a race. If drivers 
disregard these, NASCAR penalizes them in some way:
 
✓ Drivers can’t pass other drivers when the field is under a caution flag 
(see Chapter 6) or when they’re preparing to go onto pit road.
 
✓ When a driver pulls into his pit box, the two left tires and the front right 
tire have to be completely in the box. The back right can be out of it. 
Also, the front nose has to be entirely in the box.
 
✓ Only seven crew members are allowed over the pit wall at once. After a 
pit crew member returns to the pit stall, no other pit crew member can 
replace him in order to work on the car.
 
✓ Teams may use only two air guns per stop. The air guns remove lug 
nuts from the wheel hub and tighten the lug nuts after a new tire and 
wheel are mounted on the car. If one of the air guns malfunctions, the 
team must complete the stop with the one working air gun. Teams must 
take both air guns back over the pit wall after they change the tires and 
before the car leaves the pit box.
 
✓ Teams may use only one jack per pit stop. If a car falls off the jack, how-
ever, team members can use a second jack to help raise the car back up.
 
✓ A catch can man has to be on pit road to catch fuel overflow whenever 
gas is being added to the car.
The importance of a good pit crew
Drivers never underestimate the power of 
a good, fast pit crew. At least I never have. 
Suppose I’ve been running second to Jeff 
Gordon all day long and I’ve tried everything 
to pass him but can’t do it. During previous pit 
stops, I’ve gone into the pits in second place 
and come out in second place. I’ve been about 
one second behind him all day and just can’t 
catch him. In the next pit stop, though, my crew 
bangs out the fastest pit stop it’s ever had, 
finishing before Gordon’s crew. I beat Gordon 
off pit road and take the lead.
Gaining a second on pit road is much easier 
than gaining it on the track, especially in the 
final laps of a race when a driver doesn’t have 
much time to make up ground with his car. 
That’s why a good pit crew is invaluable, and 
that’s why, many times, they’re the first team 
members I mention when I climb out of my car 
in Victory Lane.

nuts before the car leaves the pit.
 
✓ Teams can’t let their tires roll across pit road or into another team’s 
pit box.
 
✓ Drivers can’t run over their air hoses or any other equipment when they 
exit the pit box.
 
✓ Tire changers must roll tires most of the way to the wall. They have to 
be in contact with the tire until they get halfway back to the pit wall.
 
✓ If a car stalls, a team can push the car no more than three pit boxes in 
the hopes of getting it started again.
To Pit or Not to Pit
A crew chief stays in radio contact with the driver throughout the race and 
tells him exactly when to make a pit stop. Teams always try to make a pit stop 
under a caution flag, which comes out an average of three or four times during 
a race after an accident, an oil spill, or debris accumulation on the track. If driv-
ers duck onto pit road under a caution flag — when traffic is slow on the track 
behind the pace car — most of the time they don’t lose a lap. That’s because 
crews can bang out a pit stop and get the driver down pit road and onto the 
race track before the rest of the field passes him to put him a lap down.
Deciding when to make a pit stop under green-flag conditions is a little more 
difficult. In some cases, a driver can get himself into all sorts of trouble by 
pitting under a green flag because a driver loses valuable laps on the track 
when he’s sitting in the pits while the other cars are whizzing by. Pitting 
under a green flag is fine if everyone else pits with you because everyone 
is losing the same number of laps. But when a caution flag comes out and a 
driver is in the middle of or has just finished a pit stop, that driver has a big 
problem. He already lost laps while pitting, but the caution flag gives other 
drivers the opportunity to avoid pitting under green — meaning they won’t 
lose any laps because the field isn’t driving top speed around the track.
S
 
Teams make it easy for drivers to find their pit box when they’re driving down 
pit road by posting a big metal sign with the team name, logo, or car number 
above the pit stall. One of the crew members also holds out a long pole with a 
big metal sign attached to it. He waves the sign up and down so that his driver 
can see it even through all the traffic. Sometimes, even with that sign, a driver 
needs help because of all the cars and activity on pit road. That’s when a crew 
chief calls the driver on the radio and coaches him to his pit box, counting 
the seconds until he arrives at it. He says, “Five, four, three, two, one!” as the 
driver pulls closer to the pit box, just to give the driver a precise time refer-
ence of how close he is.

ometimes accidents are impossible to avoid. When you drive 170 mph, 
literally inches apart, accidents happen. Luckily for drivers, though, the 
cars are built for safety and to protect drivers.
Safety standards in NASCAR weren’t always as high as they are today. They’ve 
evolved and improved as the sport has grown. In NASCAR’s infancy, the cars 
weren’t equipped as they are now to ensure drivers were able to walk away 
from a wreck. Back then, drivers raced regular cars like the ones your par-
ents drove to work, so when they collided, it sometimes wasn’t pretty. Those 
cars didn’t have the extra safety features they do now — safety features that 
save lives and protect drivers. I talk about these features, and the continued 
enhancements in safety, in this chapter.
Stock Car Safety 101
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars are made to protect the drivers. Here are 
some of the most basic safety features on a stock car:
 
✓ Stock cars have no glass, which would shatter upon impact. That means 
no headlights, taillights, or side windows.
 
✓ The front and rear windshields (as well as side windows, when they are 
used) are made of Lexan, a hard, shatterproof plastic.
 
✓ The doors can’t swing open during an accident because there aren’t 
any. That’s why a driver squeezes through the window to get into the 
driver’s seat.

162
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
 
✓ Tires have an inner liner so they don’t explode when they run over 
something on the race track. The inner liner gives the driver some time 
to notice that a tire is going flat, perhaps giving him enough time to 
make a pit stop for new tires.
Fastening Those Superior Seat Belts
Stock cars have added safety features that allow many drivers to walk away 
from accidents. Seat belts are one of the most obvious additions.
When a driver slides into his car, he doesn’t have the luxury of one of those 
automatic seat belts strapping him in for safety. It’s much more complicated 
that that, but when you’re traveling at full speed with 42 other cars on the 
track, it has to be.
 
Most drivers use five-point seat belts, which are five belts that come together 
at the center of a driver’s chest, as Figure 12-1 shows. (Some drivers have 
a six-point system.) In the five-point belt system, each of the belts passes 
through a steel guide that is welded onto the car’s frame. One belt goes over 
the driver’s left shoulder, one goes over his right shoulder, another comes 
from the left side of the seat, one comes from the right side of the seat, and 
still another comes up between the driver’s legs. They’re all latched together 
at a single point at mid-chest, where a quick-release buckle locks them into 
place. Although it takes a little while to gather all the belts and buckle up, a 
driver can release the seat belts in a fraction of a second when he lifts up on 
the latch that holds all five belts in place. This is an important feature because 
drivers may need to exit their cars quickly.

 Chapter 12: Keeping Racing Safe
Racing seat belts don’t work the way the ones in a passenger car do. The ones 
in your regular car activate when the car jolts forward or stops abruptly. The 
seat belts in a race car are working at all times. Drivers get into their seats, 
lock their seat belts, and then give the belts an extra tug, making them as snug 
as possible. In case of an accident, a driver wants to be strapped in tightly 
because the less he moves around, the less likely he’ll be injured.
If you’re listening in on a radio scanner during a race, you may hear a crew 
chief tell his driver to “give one more tug” on his seat belts during a race. 
Why? No matter how cool it is outside, a driver’s seat belts become looser 
and looser during a race because of the extreme heat inside the car. Drivers 
can lose as much as five to ten pounds during a race as they perspire, so they 
need to keep tightening their seat belts — during caution periods, not while 
going full speed — in order for the seat belts to provide optimum protection.
Preventing Flailing Limbs 
with Window Nets
While seat belts keep a driver secured to the seat, they don’t keep a driver’s 
head and arms inside a race car when the car tumbles. That’s exactly what 
Richard Petty found out when his car flipped several times in May 1970 
at Darlington Raceway after slamming into the inside wall along the front-
stretch. When his car began to flip, Petty’s left arm and head came flopping 
Rusty’s wild ride
While most drivers know first-hand how safe 
today’s cars are, Rusty Wallace has perhaps the 
best story to tell after surviving one of the most 
spectacular accidents in NASCAR history. In 
1993, he was racing on the last lap at Talladega 
Superspeedway when Dale Earnhardt smacked 
into Rusty’s back bumper and sent him flying. 
Literally. His car began spinning and was slid-
ing backwards when air got under his car and 
lifted the rear end off the ground. That’s when 
the roller-coaster ride began.
Wallace’s car tumbled down the frontstretch, 
flipping eight or nine times before rolling to a 
stop in the infield. “I just wanted it to stop,” 
Wallace said. “I was thinking, man, this is going 
to be real bad.”
Surprisingly, though, in a testament to how safe 
NASCAR stock cars are, Wallace ended up with 
only minor injuries. Examples like that keep driv-
ers from worrying as they climb into their race 
cars, knowing that drivers usually come away 
with only minor injuries, or none at all.

out the window as the car flew through the air. Petty survived the accident 
with only a dislocated shoulder, but NASCAR officials made sure nobody 
else would have to face the same threat by instituting the use of window nets, 
which are screens made of a nylon mesh material that cover the driver’s side 
window (refer to Figure 12-1). They help keep the driver’s arms and head in 
the car during an accident.
A driver hooks the window net to the top of the window opening with a 
pair of latches similar to the one used in the seat belt. It’s a quick-release 
latch that takes only a second to unhook. During a race, a driver unhooks 
the window net after an accident, which signals that he isn’t hurt badly. In a 
multi-car accident, that signal helps safety workers determine which driver 
needs help first.
Window nets are used only on the driver’s side of the car. On the passenger 
side, there sometimes is a clear, shatterproof plastic window that protects 
the driver and provides for better aerodynamics — but only at tracks one 
and a half miles or more in length. This window doesn’t roll down because 
it’s just a shield that fits into and is secured in the window opening. On 
smaller tracks and on road courses, cars don’t use the passenger-side 
window — there’s just a big opening.
Holding Your Head Still: Helmets 
and Head Protectors
Helmets are the number-one piece of protective gear that drivers can’t do 
without. Drivers don’t just go to the local sporting goods store to buy their 
helmets. They get them from special manufacturers who fit each helmet 
specifically to each driver’s head and put special padding inside the helmet 
to reduce impact during an accident. After an accident, these manufacturers 
examine the helmet and X-ray it to see whether there are any internal cracks. 
If there are, the driver has to replace the helmet.
Starting in 2002, NASCAR mandated the use of approved head and neck 
restraints by all drivers on every type of race circuit. These head and neck 
restraints, called the HANS Device (HANS is short for “Head and Neck 
Support”) and the Hutchens Device, help reduce extreme head motion 
during incidents and sudden stops. The HANS Device utilizes tethers that 
are attached from the HANS collar to both sides of the driver’s helmet. In the 
Hutchens Device, tethers are attached from the Hutchens body harness to 
both sides of the driver’s helmet. Head protectors vary because each seat is 
customized to fit a driver’s body.

 Chapter 12: Keeping Racing Safe
Keeping Your Wheels on the Ground
 
After cars start spinning, they usually don’t become airborne — despite being 
so aerodynamic. Cars have roof flaps on them designed to keep them on the 
ground. Roof flaps are rectangular pieces of metal attached to the roof of a car 
that are designed to lie flat when the car is moving forward and to pop into the 
air when a car spins backwards or sideways (see Figure 12-2). Roof flaps keep 
a car from lifting into the air.
Some NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars also have a roof hatch, which is like a 
trapdoor on the roof of the car. This hatch allows a driver to exit the car if his 
window opening is blocked somehow. While it’s still legal to have roof hatches, 
few cars still do. The new NASCAR Sprint Cup car (see the upcoming section 
“Safer Than Ever: The New Car”) has a bigger window than the old car, which 
makes exiting the car a lot easier. So, most drivers forego the roof hatches.

Putting out fires
In the early years of NASCAR racing, fires were 
a serious problem for drivers. To improve safety, 
NASCAR officials mandated that all drivers use 
rubber gas tanks — containers that were far 
less likely to puncture, burst, or explode upon 
impact. Now fire is rarely a problem in NASCAR 
because cars are built with fire walls between 
the trunk where the gas tank is located and the 
driver’s compartment, as well as between the 
driver and the engine.
According to NASCAR rules, every car must 
have a fire extinguisher installed within the 
driver’s reach. NASCAR has also mandated that 
the crew member who fuels the car wear fire-
resistant gear: a suit, gloves, shoes, and helmet 
with face protection. (See Chapter 11 for more 
on gassing up a car during a pit stop.)

166
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
Staying Safe inside the Roll Cage
 
A protective cage surrounds the driver, safeguarding him during the impact of 
an accident. This roll cage of protective steel tubing called roll bars keeps the 
driver from getting crushed if the car flips on its roof or side (see Figure 12-3).
While regular passenger cars have a simple frame, the roll cage of a stock 
car is very extensive. For example, the driver’s side door is reinforced with 
roll bars and energy-absorbing foam that is installed to protect the driver 
from a driver’s side impact. Another bar travels through the center of a car’s 
windshield, going from the top of the dashboard to the roof of the car. It 
keeps the roof from collapsing on a driver. All the roll bars within a driver’s 
reach inside the car are wrapped in padding. With protective bars and pad-
ding almost everywhere to ensure safety, drivers can survive crashes at full 
speed, sometimes even without a scrape.
 
NASCAR officials make sure the roll bars that make up the roll cage are thick 
enough to keep a driver safe. During a routine inspection, they climb inside 
the car and use special instruments to determine the thickness of the steel. 
(Most of the roll bars are in plain view inside the car.) They also examine the 
roll bars to make sure teams haven’t drilled holes in them to make the car 
lighter in certain areas. Officials also make sure that roll bars are made of steel 
and not a lighter, softer, or less-durable metal. (See Chapter 6 for more infor-
mation about inspections and ways teams try to get around the rules to gain 
an advantage.)

Racing Uniforms: Sporting 
NASCAR’s Sunday Best
Just like other professional athletes, NASCAR drivers have uniforms. Those 
uniforms serve many more functions than simply identifying one driver from 
another — and one sponsor from another — outside of the race car. The uni-
forms have a special, protective use in case of a fire in the car.
Drivers wear fire-resistant suits similar to jumpsuits (see Figure 12-4). They 
cover their legs and arms, and they zip up from the waist to the neck. Under 
those suits, drivers wear fire-retardant long underwear. While these suits 
make drivers hotter and more uncomfortable inside the car, the benefits are 
worth it. In the rare instance of a fire, the uniform can be a lifesaver by pre-
venting burns.

Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
In addition to their fire suits, drivers also wear special gloves and boots that 
protect their hands and feet from the heat and possible fires inside the car. 
While the boots are insulated to keep out heat, drivers often also wear heat 
shields over their boots because the floorboards and pedals get so hot that 
the heat’s unbearable without additional protection. Sometimes even those 
heat shields don’t provide enough protection. Some of the more creative 
drivers cut out the bottoms of Styrofoam cups and stick them on their heels. 
But other drivers try to tough it out. Retired NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver 
Dave Marcis for many years hopped into his car wearing old-fashioned, wing-
tip street shoes with no extra protection.
To give you an example of how hot the floorboards can get, Tony Stewart 
forgot to put on his heat shields for one race in 1999 and ended up with 
burns and blisters on his heels, which kept him out of commission for more 
than a week. After a race in 1998, Johnny Benson gave his post-race inter-
views with his feet stuck inside a bucket of ice water.
Safer Than Ever: The New Car
In 2007, NASCAR introduced a new car to be used on a part-time basis in the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The car — then known as the Car of Tomorrow — 
was designed to lower costs and improve both competition and safety. In 
2008, the new car ran the entire schedule, and its blueprint was a success. 
Competition increased, and a race car has never been safer. Some of the 
safety features include the following:
 
✓ Crushable driver’s side zone: Energy-absorbing foam was installed 
between the roll-cage door bars and door panels to reduce energy 
during side impacts.
 
✓ More room: The seat was moved 4 inches closer to the center of the 
car, and the roof was raised 2.5 inches. Also, the driver’s side window is 
bigger, which makes driver exit easier.
 
✓ Fuel safety measures: The fuel cell got smaller and stronger, which 
reduces the chance of fire. Also, energy-absorbing material was put 
around the fuel cell that protects it from destruction.
 
✓ Stronger materials: The doors and the floors have been reinforced with 
steel plates and strong bars. A fire wall was also inserted, which sepa-
rates the driver from the engine — and helps lessen the heat transferred 
from the engine to the cockpit.

Lane and the Championship
In This Chapter

W
inning a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race is every stock-car driver’s 
goal. Some never get there, but those talented enough and lucky 
enough to win are certainly grateful when they finally reach the pinnacle 
of the sport. In some cases it takes years; in others, just a few seasons. No 
matter how long it takes, the satisfaction of finally getting to Victory Lane 
makes the wait worthwhile.
This chapter shows you what’s involved in making it to Victory Lane and also 
how drivers compete to make the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup in the 
hopes of winning a championship.
Heading into Victory Lane
Victory Lane isn’t really a lane — it’s more like a circle or square in a fenced-
in area somewhere near pit road. It’s where a driver goes to celebrate after 
winning a race.
Making a grand entrance
After the winner crosses the finish line, he circles the track one more time for 
a cool-down lap and then drives down pit road toward Victory Lane. Before 
getting there, some drivers like to add some panache to their win by doing 
doughnuts — spinning the car in circles — in the infield or on the frontstretch. 

170
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
The car’s wheels spin out, burn rubber, and send smoke into the air, leaving 
behind a bunch of tire marks and a bunch of screaming fans.
Some drivers go even farther than just doing doughnuts as part of their cel-
ebration. The late Alan Kulwicki, the 1992 NASCAR Sprint Cup champion, who 
was of Polish descent, used to drive the opposite way around the track to 
celebrate a win. That way, his driver’s side window faced the crowd so they 
could see him smile and pump his arm — and he could see the crowd cheer. 
It became known as Kulwicki’s trademark “Polish Victory Lap” before he died 
in a plane crash in April 1993. Drivers continue the tradition even today, driv-
ing a backward victory lap after each win.
Arguably the most famous victory celebration today belongs to Carl Edwards. 
After every win, Edwards climbs out of his car, stands atop the driver side 
door, and does a back flip. Fans and fellow competitors marvel at how 
Edwards has the energy to do gymnastics even after a taxing 500-mile race.
Joining a packed crowd
Victory Lane is packed with all sorts of people. Of course, the winning team and 
the winning owner are in there, along with the driver’s family, TV reporters, pho-
tographers, sponsor representatives, NASCAR media representatives, NASCAR 
officials, track officials, and track public relations people (see Figure 13-1). Fans 
often pack the fencing outside of Victory Lane to take pictures, but credentials, 
which allow you entrance into the garage area, cannot be purchased.

 Chapter 13: Winning It All: Making It to Victory Lane and the Championship
Doing live network TV (and radio) 
interviews
Ever notice when you’re watching a race that you come back from a commer-
cial and see the driver getting out of his car just in time for cameras to catch 
it on live TV? It’s not luck; it’s set up that way. A driver may drive into Victory 
Lane and pull his car up to the awaiting crowd, but he can’t get out until the 
network TV crew tells him to. Even if he is about to burst with excitement 
over the win or is exhausted from the heat of the day, he has to sit in the car 
and wait a few seconds until the commercial break is over. Then, and only 
then, can the driver dramatically emerge from his car, climb on the roof, and 
start spraying people with champagne or any other available liquid.
After that, the winner has time only to give his crew chief or owner a quick 
handshake and his wife a quick peck on the cheek before he gets interviewed 
on live TV. After TV is done, he gets interviewed on live radio, which most of 
the time is broadcast throughout the grandstands. After TV and radio inter-
views are done, the photo session begins.
Smiling for photos and 
doing the hat dance
A hoard of photographers waits somewhere inside Victory Lane to take pic-
tures of the winner, his crew, his family, and his sponsors. But it’s not just a 
quick snap-and-go photo shoot as you may expect. A driver poses with the 
following people each time he wins:
 
✓ His team
 
✓ His car owner
 
✓ His family
 
✓ His car owner’s family
 
✓ Each of his sponsors
 
✓ The event sponsors, such as Coca-Cola employees at the Coca-Cola 600
 
✓ Representatives from his car manufacturer
 
The photo shoot is especially complex because a driver has to do the hat dance. 
He must put on and take off dozens of caps, each with different sponsor logos 
on it. Each time the driver puts on a cap, the photographers snap photos to 
send or sell to the sponsor. Those photos are one of the perks a sponsor gets 
for being involved with the team and in the sport. While a driver appreciates 
all the sponsors’ involvement, you can bet that it’s a challenge to smile as big 

172
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
at the end of the hat dance as at the beginning. Still, even after posing for 
his 45th picture, the driver doesn’t have too tough a time smiling. After all, he’s 
just won a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race! And that’s not an easy thing to do.
Talking to newspaper and 
magazine reporters
The Victory Lane proceedings last about 45 minutes, depending on the race, 
but even then the driver isn’t free to go celebrate with his crew. Public rela-
tions representatives whisk the driver away to the media center where he and 
his crew chief and/or car owner talk to newspaper and magazine reporters for 
about a half hour. There’s always a question-and-answer session in front of 
the group and often another session in which reporters get to ask the driver 
questions in a small group. The winner isn’t the only one expected to go to the 
media center, though. The second- and third-place drivers must go as well. And 
if a rookie finishes in the top ten, he’ll also head to the media center.
Going back to Victory Lane
After the media center, it’s back to Victory Lane for the race winner. He 
needs to take even more photos. These are usually only single shots, with 
the driver standing alone with the trophy wearing even more sponsor hats. 
During this time, he’ll also do one-on-one interviews with a number of TV sta-
tions. No one ever said being a winner is easy.
Stopping by the suites
Though it’s rare, sometimes the winner goes to the suites where employ-
ees from sponsoring companies await him. He answers a few questions and 
then signs autographs. Champagne flows freely for everyone there in order 
to celebrate the victory some more. At some tracks, the driver also may go 
to the track owner’s suite or a NASCAR suite after winning. Usually, though, 
after his photo and media obligations are complete, he gets to go back to his 
motor coach and celebrate — or take a much deserved nap.

173
 Chapter 13: Winning It All: Making It to Victory Lane and the Championship
Taking Home the Race Purse
The race purse can get a bit complicated. There is no cut-and-dry amount 
that a driver receives for finishing first — or finishing last, for that matter. It 
all depends on the track and how big the race is. For instance, a driver wins a 
lot more money for a Daytona 500 victory than for any other race.
A breakdown of the winnings for each race is listed in the entry blank. An 
entry blank lists the earning for each position and also details the start times 
for practice, qualifying, and the race during the race weekend.
When a driver wins a race, NASCAR publishes the amount he’s won. That’s 
the number you see in the newspaper the next day. But a driver doesn’t leave 
the race track with all that cash stuffed into his driver’s suit. He has to share 
the winnings. Depending on the contract with the team owner, a driver may 
get up to 50 percent of the money he wins.
The total money won in a given race is broken down into four pieces:
 
✓ Race purse
 
✓ Television awards
 
✓ Special plans
 
✓ Contingency awards
The race purse and television awards comprise the biggest chunk of the total 
purse. A number of outlets contribute to those purses — namely NASCAR, 
the track, a few sponsors, and television outlets.
The special plans are given based on past performance and participation. The 
most lucrative of the special plans is known as the “Champion Owner Program.” 
This program awards money to those teams that have entered every NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series event for the past three seasons. Only two cars per owner are 
eligible. This program is NASCAR’s way of thanking long-standing teams for their 
support of the sport. Another special plan is the “Winner’s Circle Program.” It’s 
given to the drivers with the highest win totals from the previous season and to 
the first two winners of the current season who weren’t already on the Winner’s 
Circle Program. The two other special plans are given to drivers who qualify based 
on their owners’ points position.

174
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
Finally, NASCAR and its sponsoring companies award special funds called 
contingency awards. These are based solely on certain finishes — they’re not 
always given to the winner. Sometimes, the 5th-place driver gets an award, 
and sometimes the 20th place driver gets it. It’s broken down this way so 
all drivers have something to shoot for. Not all drivers participate in all the 
available awards, especially if a contingency sponsor is deemed to be a con-
flict of interest with a driver’s primary sponsor. For instance, Greg Biffle — 
who is sometimes sponsored by Dish Network — does not participate in the 
DIRECTV contingency award program.
Figuring Out the Points System
After every event, points are given to drivers and their car owners, depending on 
where they finish in a race. The system used today was put into place in 1975.
The winner of a race gets 185 points, and the last-place finisher receives 34 
points. You can see how somebody can lose a lot of ground in the NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series championship if he blows an engine and finishes last.
Earning points
 
Both car owners and drivers earn points, but they do so in slightly different 
ways. A driver accrues points (called driver points) for the races he competes 
in, whatever car he drives. But a car owner accrues points — called car owner 
points — whenever his car is in a race, no matter who’s driving it. This system 
ensures that teams reap benefits from running in a race and investing in the 
sport. Driver points accumulate toward the championship, while owner points 
accumulate both to win an owner’s championship and to help teams obtain 
guaranteed starting positions. (See Chapter 9 to find out how guaranteed start-
ing positions work.)
This points system is the reason you sometimes see drivers with the flu, 
broken bones, or other maladies slide into their cars on race day just to com-
plete one lap. They don’t do that because they love pain but because a driver 
needs to complete one lap of a race in order to earn points. (NASCAR awards 
points to the driver who starts the race.) After that lap (or after he can’t take 
the pain anymore), he pulls onto pit road where a relief driver replaces him.
 
The relief driver may be a driver who had mechanical problems with his car 
and retired from the race early. Or he may be a NASCAR Nationwide Series 
driver who just happens to be at the race that day. Regardless of the relief 
driver’s experience, he’s someone who gets in the car because the primary 
driver isn’t healthy enough to finish the race. The relief driver may hop in the 
car for free or may charge a one-day fee for his services, depending on how 

175
 Chapter 13: Winning It All: Making It to Victory Lane and the Championship
well the driver and team owner know the relief driver and whether that relief 
driver is willing to do the team a favor. Whatever it costs, the injured driver or 
the team owner is happy to pay. If that relief driver finishes well, the injured 
driver ends up with the championship points because he started the race. And 
the car owner accumulates those points, too, no matter who drives his car.
Breaking down the point earnings
Here is a breakdown of each finishing position and how many points the 
driver and car owner earn for that race:

Racking up bonus points during the race
In addition to the regular points that drivers and teams get for competing in a 
race, they also can earn bonus points in a couple of different ways:
 
✓ Any driver who leads a lap gets five extra points. That means he must 
be in front of the field when crossing the start/finish line. So, a race 
winner gets a minimum of 190 points for winning a race because, at the 
very least, he led the final lap. Sometimes a driver stays out when the 
rest of the field makes a pit stop just so he can lead one lap and pick up 
those five extra points. A driver may do this when he’s scrounging for 
points because he is in the hunt for the championship or because he 
is fighting to get in the top 35 in the standings so that his team can get 
guaranteed starting positions (see Chapter 9).

177
 Chapter 13: Winning It All: Making It to Victory Lane and the Championship
 
✓ The driver who leads the most laps gets five more bonus points. A 
race winner potentially can earn 195 points for winning — 185 for the 
victory, 5 for leading a lap, and 5 more for leading the most laps. Sometimes 
it doesn’t work that way, and a race winner leads only one lap — the last.
Getting bonus points for winning a race
There are more bonus points to be had, but a driver can’t get them during a 
race. He gets them only after a race — and only if he wins.
For each win during the first 26 races — the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series’ regu-
lar season — a driver gets ten bonus points added on to his Chase for the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup seeding.
This rule came into effect in 2007 to put more emphasis on winning races. 
That year, Jimmie Johnson went into the playoffs (which I explain in the 
next section) as the Chase’s top driver. He won six times during the regular 
season and earned 60 bonus points for the feat.
Winning the NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series Championship
Winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship — stock-car racing’s 
version of the World Series, the Stanley Cup, or an Olympic gold medal — 
isn’t necessarily about winning the most races, although that certainly helps. 
It’s about winning the most points during a season.
Going to the playoffs
Beginning in 2004, NASCAR introduced fans to its version of the playoffs: the 
Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, a completely new system for crowning a 
champion. Following the 26th race of the season — the fall race at Richmond 
International Raceway — only the top 12 drivers in the point standings are 
eligible to contend for the series title. With 10 races remaining, starting at 
New Hampshire Motor Speedway, the top 12 drivers all have their points 
reset to 5,000. Then, an additional 10 points are added to that total for every 
win they had during the first 26 races. For this reason, winning races became 
an even bigger priority than before. Revamping the points among the top-12 

178
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
drivers not only closes the points race but means that a driver who has an 
accident or technical failure can quickly be eliminated from the title race 
(although he is guaranteed a final points finish of 12th or better).
S
 
The race for the championship is hectic, nerve-wracking business. In 1997, 
the championship came down to the last race of the season, the NAPA 500 at 
Atlanta Motor Speedway. Before the race began, nobody knew who would be 
the champion — Jeff Gordon, Dale Jarrett, or me. Gordon had to finish 18th 
or better to win the title; otherwise, Dale or I would have had a chance. As it 
turned out — unfortunately for me — Gordon finished 17th in the race and won 
his second title. Jarrett finished second in the championship, just 14 points 
behind Gordon. I finished third in the championship, just 29 points out of first.
A driver doesn’t always clinch the championship at the final race of the 
season, however. If his lead is big enough, he can clinch the title with two or 
three races to go. That means he’s gained enough points that the driver in 
second place has no mathematical chance of catching him. The first-place 
driver could finish last in the remaining races — and sometimes not even 
start those races — and he still would walk away the champion. Those days 
are likely gone, though. The Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup has made the 
final race of the season a must-watch event.
Reaping the benefits of being the best
Although the money prize may be the most obvious perk of winning the 
championship — for instance, Jimmie Johnson took home an extra $8 million 
for winning his 2007 title — there are many others:
 
✓ Media exposure: After winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champi-
onship, the driver goes on a whirlwind media tour. Reporters interview 
him, and photographers take thousands of photos. He traditionally is 
invited to visit Late Night with David Letterman and Live! With Regis & Kelly. 
It’s a thrill from the moment he wins until the end of the next season when 
his reign ends (unless he wins the title again). A driver’s sponsors are 
ecstatic about the media blitz, which gives them even more exposure 
than usual.
 
✓ Prestige: Winning the championship means that you’re the best stock-
car driver on the best team that year. And no matter how your career 
unfolds after you win NASCAR’s top honor, you’ll always be known as a 
NASCAR Sprint Cup champion. Fans and other drivers never forget it — 
and the record books don’t erase it.

179
 Chapter 13: Winning It All: Making It to Victory Lane and the Championship
 
✓ Respect: When you win a championship, other drivers and teams look 
at you differently. It doesn’t matter whether they like you as a person; 
they respect you for your accomplishment. They know how good a 
team must be throughout the season — not just for part of a season — to 
win the title. Drivers can’t just win a majority of the races and expect 
to win the championship. They have to record good finishes week after 
week and finish every race — or nearly every race. If a driver wins half 
the races in a year but gets into accidents and fails to finish the other 
half — which are called DNFs because a driver did not finish — he isn’t 
going to win the championship.
 
✓ A great parking spot: The reigning champion gets to park his team hauler 
in the No. 1 spot in the garage and also uses the best garage stall at each 
track for the entire year. The rest of the teams line up their haulers and use 
garage stalls according to where they rank in the points championship.
But of all the perks a driver gets for winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
championship, the end-of-the-year banquet may be the most fun. Each year 
during the first weekend in December, NASCAR holds an award banquet at the 
luxurious Waldorf=Astoria Hotel in New York City. That’s where NASCAR pays 
tribute to the champion and his team. It’s also where NASCAR and Sprint hand 
the drivers checks for their year-long performance. Numerous trophies are 
also awarded, including the one for the series champion and the rookie of year 
(which I discuss in the next section). The spouse of the champion traditionally 
also receives nice gifts, including a replica of the winner’s ring.
In the week preceding the banquet, the champion is ferried around the city in 
a limousine. He goes to photo shoots, newspaper interviews, and live TV 
programs. Broadway shows are a top draw, as are meals at New York’s finest 
restaurants. He and his family stay in the most glamorous suite at the Waldorf.
The Manufacturers’ Championship
Four manufacturers produce the cars that you 
see in NASCAR races: Chevrolet, Dodge, Ford, 
and Toyota. All four companies compete for the 
year-end Manufacturers’ Championship. Each 
manufacturer gets a certain amount of points 
for each race, and the highest total at the end 
of the year wins the championship.
In a given race, the winning manufacturer gets 
nine points. The manufacturer that finishes 
second gets six points; third gets four; and 
fourth gets three.
The championship is extremely important to 
each manufacturer. NASCAR fans are the most 
brand loyal in all of sports. The manufacturers 
know that if they win the title they may sell a 
few more cars at the end of the season. As 
the old saying goes, “Win on Sunday, sell on 
Monday.”

180
Par t III: What Happens on (and off) the Track 
After the driver finishes his media tour of New York City, he dresses up and 
heads for the banquet. It’s a black-tie function where everybody celebrates 
the end of the season. Drivers, team owners, and crew members wear tuxedos 
instead of their driving suits or uniforms (you’d be amazed at how they clean 
up), and wives and girlfriends dress in sparkling gowns. While all drivers 
are invited to the year-end ceremony, only those who finish in the top ten in 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series points give speeches to the crowd packed into the 
Grand Ballroom. That’s one big difference between finishing 10th and 11th in 
points; only the top ten are called up on stage.
Taking Home the Raybestos 
Rookie of the Year Award
The Raybestos Rookie of the Year Award is one of the honors given out at 
the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series banquet. All the drivers running their first full 
season on the circuit are eligible, unless they’ve run more than seven races 
in the series during another year. Some of the best drivers in NASCAR history 
are former Rookies of the Year, including NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champi-
ons Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, and Tony Stewart.
NASCAR and Raybestos award Rookie of the Year honors to the first-year 
driver whose best 17 finishes are higher than any other first-year driver. 
There’s a complex scoring system that gives one point to every rookie who 
attempts to qualify for a race, ten points to the highest finishing rookie, nine 
points to the next highest finishing rookie, and so on. Top-ten finishes are 
awarded extra points.
NASCAR also doles out discretionary points at the end of the year based on 
how a driver conducts himself with the fans, the media, and his fellow com-
petitors. This way, NASCAR officials have the final word on which rookie wins 
the award.

S
ome people think NASCAR drivers just drive in circles all the time. They 
get into cars, go fast, and turn left — doing the same thing week after 
week without any variance or scenery changes. That couldn’t be farther from 
the truth.
 
The races are always different, even though drivers do go fast and turn left 
most of the time. It’s hard to tell from the grandstands, but each track has its 
own characteristics that make it challenging. One track may be high-banked in 
the turns — which means the racing surface is steeply sloped — while another 
track may be nearly flat. One may have a smooth surface, while another has 
plenty of bumps. One may have a wide straightaway, which is the long section 
of track between the turns, while another may have a narrow straightaway.
Not only does each track feel different to drive on, but each looks different, 
too. You can find restrictor-plate superspeedways (the longest of all NASCAR 
tracks), intermediate tracks, short tracks, and road courses. All have differ-
ent sizes and shapes — and if a driver wants to be successful, he must be 
able to negotiate every track with skill. Drivers have to be versatile and able 
to adapt quickly to different tracks each week.
NASCAR’s wide range of race tracks does more than pose a challenge for the 
drivers — it also gives fans variety. If watching the bump-and-pass moves 
on a short track doesn’t thrill you, perhaps you’re drawn to the high speeds 
of a superspeedway. Or maybe you find watching a driver’s agility on a road 
course more thrilling. Whatever your taste, NASCAR has a track for you. Each 
track also has a seat for you. Many race tracks seat more than 100,000 fans,

not including the infield, which may be filled with fans perched atop motor 
homes and cars to get a glimpse of the action.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on all the different track types and the 
styles of racing they produce. It also gives you a brief intro to each of the 
NASCAR tracks.
Going Super Fast at Superspeedways
If you’re looking for high-speed thrills, you’ll love restrictor-plate superspeed-
ways. Drivers race in excess of 180 mph down the straightaways while just 
inches apart from each other, and long conga lines of cars zoom past the 
start/finish line in a blur of color.
 
In NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing, only two tracks are restrictor-plate super-
speedways: Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. 
They fall into that category because of their size (2.5 miles or more), because 
they’re high-banked (at least 31 degrees), and because they require the use of 
carburetor restrictor plates.
This section shows you why carburetor restrictor plates are used and how 
teams prepare for racing on the superspeedways.
Racing with restrictor plates
In the past, cars used to average speeds of more than 200 mph circling these 
tracks, but in 1988, NASCAR officials decided to slow the cars down to make 
races safer. The plates were introduced after Bill Elliott turned a qualifying 
lap of 212 mph in 1987. Knowing that the crews would continue to find more 
speed in newer engines, NASCAR added the plate requirement at the fastest 
superspeedways in the series. Despite the plates, the laps remain some of the 
fastest of the year, as the frontstretch and backstretch are long enough for 
cars to reach maximum (although still restricted) speeds.
 
A carburetor restrictor plate is a metal plate with four holes drilled into it that 
NASCAR officials place atop an engine’s carburetor. (See Chapter 6 for a dia-
gram of the carburetor restrictor plate.) The holes in the plate restrict the 
amount of fuel and air that flow through the carburetor and into the intake 
manifold, on the way to the combustion chamber. The fuel and air mixture 
must squeeze through the four small holes before flowing more quickly 
through the four larger holes in the carburetor.
In short, the plate chokes the flow of air into the engine, which reduces its 
horsepower. So, instead of cars roaring around the monster tracks with 
about 750 horsepower, they have about 430. And less horsepower means less

speed. Although fans noticed a difference in the type of racing at the plate 
races (drivers weren’t able to pass as easily as before), the plates also ben-
efited fans physically; accidents at supersonic speeds can sometimes send 
debris flying into the grandstands.
Although fans immediately felt the benefits of restrictor-plate racing with the 
increased safety of grandstand areas, the drivers had to learn a new kind of 
racing for the superspeedway races: how to break out of packs caused by the 
cars being set up so equally.
The restrictor plates choke an engine to the point where throttle response 
is slower. So, instead of cars being able to accelerate away from each other, 
they drive around the track in packs — sometimes one large, single pack. 
And that leaves drivers feeling less in control of their cars. Drivers would 
much rather drive at staggered speeds in order to pass one another. Also, 
without the ability to zoom past a rival coming off a turn or into the back-
stretch, it’s imperative for drivers and their crew chiefs to make deals by 
radio as the race winds down. Two drivers drafting (see Chapter 10 for a 
discussion of drafting), one behind the other, can give the lead car the extra 
second needed to win the race.
 
Superspeedways make the drivers’ decisions about when to accelerate and 
when to brake very easy: A driver always has his foot to the floor and rarely 
brakes (unless he sees an accident). This is called running wide open. Drivers 
can do this at restrictor-plate superspeedways because the engines are 
choked down. If the engine didn’t have a restrictor plate, the car would be 
running well over 200 mph even through the corners — and it would be nearly 
out of control.
The thrill of superspeedways
I’m one of the few drivers in the NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series garage who knows how it feels 
to drive a car on a superspeedway without a 
restricted engine. That’s a feeling a driver never 
forgets. I drove in an Automobile Racing Club of 
America (ARCA) race in 1981 at Talladega and 
averaged more than 200 mph per lap. We didn’t 
race in packs back then because we didn’t use 
carburetor restrictor plates, and drivers had 
control over whether they were going to run 
wide open or not. A driver could go so fast that 
he needed to brake in certain situations (or else, 
he crashed) — so a driver and his skill were 
integral in performing well in the event.
At that time, no one dared run an inch off some-
one else’s bumper because it was frightening. 
The cars ran fast, and drivers knew they were 
going fast. Now, though, it’s like driving down 
the highway going 40 mph. Drivers aren’t afraid 
of driving an inch behind the car ahead of them 
because they don’t feel as if they’re going fast 
at all. Drivers feel totally in control. But in a 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car, that feeling is 
deceiving. While we are driving slower than 
before, we’re still going pretty darn fast.
S

186
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
Even though the restrictor plates cause cars to bunch in packs, many times 
you see a group of cars breaking away from the main pack to form a lead 
pack. However, if one of the drivers makes even the slightest mistake going 
180 mph with a train of ten cars behind him, he may inadvertently cause an 
11-car pileup in no time. At restrictor-plate tracks, fans call this type of inevi-
table pileup “The Big One.”
Drivers sometimes are able to react quickly to avoid an accident just ahead 
of them. Sometimes they miss a wreck by just a few feet. But most of the 
time, unfortunately, drivers can do nothing if a car just inches ahead of them 
blows a tire and veers wildly out of control.
Seeking optimal aerodynamics
 
Race teams spend many long days working on their cars before arriving 
at superspeedways. That’s because aerodynamics, or the airflow over the 
surfaces of a car, is crucial at those big, high-speed tracks. The long straight-
aways and wide, sweeping turns provide a perfect arena for cars to go fast. 
Even with restricted engines, the cars still exceed 180 mph on the straight-
aways. That means they’re cutting through the air pretty fast.
Why is aerodynamics so important at superspeedways? At those tracks, a 
driver never takes his foot off the gas pedal, so one of the only ways to get 
an advantage over the competition is to have a car that slips through the air 
better. A sleeker car means a faster car. That’s why race teams are forever 
refining and reworking the bodies of their cars in preparation for a super-
speedway race. While a winning car at a short track may have a banged-up 
side or a crumpled bumper, even the tiniest imperfection on a car costs pre-
cious speed on superspeedways — and can cost a win, too.
A physics lesson
Aerodynamics and superspeedways go hand 
in hand. You can experience a good example 
of the effect of aerodynamics when you stick 
your hand out of a car window. When you cup 
your hand, you feel resistance from the air, and 
you have trouble keeping your hand still. But 
when you keep your hand flat like a knife or a 
wing, the air flows over your hand more easily 
and much of that pressure from the air is gone. 
That’s the same way that race cars work. The 
shape of the car is critical when designing for 
improved aerodynamics. Each team wants to 
make its car as sleek as possible, so that it slips 
through the air.

187
 Chapter 14: Get ting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
Conducting wind tunnel tests
In preparation for a superspeedway race, such as the Daytona 500 that kicks 
off the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season each February, teams take their 
cars to a wind tunnel to figure out how well air is flowing over the cars. A 
wind tunnel is just what it sounds like: a tunnel that shoots wind at a car from 
all different angles. Just like other kinds of scientific testing, it’s a slow and 
tedious process to get all the data from the wind tunnel, but the information 
is invaluable. Teams may make one change to the body of the car, and then 
go to the wind tunnel and compare the results to the last time they went. If 
the results are worse, they know the change wasn’t a good one and that they 
must go back a step and rethink their methods. During one day at a wind 
tunnel, a team may change the car 20 times before coming up with an aero-
dynamic shape that works for them. Any changes, of course, must remain 
within the template measurements mandated by NASCAR.
Following are some of the measurements taken at a wind tunnel:
 
✓ Drag: When a car moves through the air, the air causes different kinds of 
pressure on the surfaces of the vehicle. Drag is one of them. Drag also is 
something race teams can’t stand because it slows the car down tremen-
dously. Basically, drag is a major drag.
 
 Drag is caused by several things, including a high amount of air pressure 
pushing on the front of the car and low air pressure pulling on the back 
of the car. Other things cause drag, such as air flowing through the cool-
ing system, ducts in the body, and open windows. Air travels into these 
openings instead of smoothly sliding over the car. Also, friction between 
a car’s body and the air flowing over it causes drag.
 
 With less drag, a car can accelerate faster, especially at higher speeds, 
because it needs less horsepower to move forward through the air.
 
✓ Downforce: While drag is bad, one type of air pressure is actually good 
for a race car — and that’s downforce. Downforce is the air pressure that 
pushes a car onto the track, giving it better traction at high speeds and 
on turns. When the air pressure on the top of the body is greater than 
the air pressure on the bottom of the body, you have downforce.
 
 Even if a car isn’t engineered to have a lot of downforce, NASCAR 
allows cars to have front air dams, front splitters, and rear wings in the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, which help create downforce:
 
• A front air dam is a special extension that goes from the bottom of 
the front bumper and extends nearly to the ground. (See Chapter 5 
for an illustration and further explanation.) Most of the time, pas-
senger cars don’t have them, but race cars do in order to control the 
amount of air flowing under the car and the amount of air pressure 

188
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
pushing the front end to the ground. The air dam reduces drag 
because air has less space to flow beneath the car; instead, the air 
slides over the car. The air dam also increases downforce because 
more air is flowing over the car, so more air is pushing down on 
the car, giving it more traction. That’s why teams put tape over 
the front air dam during a qualifying lap. It reduces drag and adds 
downforce, giving the car the best chance to run the fastest pos-
sible lap. But before the race starts, that tape must come off. If air 
can’t get to the engine for a long stretch of time, it will overheat 
and possibly blow up.
 
• A front splitter is attached to the bottom of the front bumper. It 
catches air rather than deflecting it and can be adjusted from 4 to 
6 inches to give the driver a “tighter” or “looser” setup. (For more 
on “tight” and “loose” setups, see Chapter 5.) The splitter gives 
teams the ability to tune the front downforce to suit the individual 
drivers and tracks.
 
• A rear wing is a raised blade with end plates that is attached to the 
trunk lid of the car. (Turn to Chapter 5 for an illustration and more 
explanation.) When air flows over and along the sides of a car, the 
wing cuts it and helps steady the car, allowing for better balance and 
control in traffic. The rear wing angle can be adjusted from 0 to 16 
degrees, which allows teams to tune rear downforce levels to suit 
individual drivers and tracks. The end plates can either be flat or 
curved, which also can be changed at the track to fit a driver’s style.
The trip to the wind tunnel is never a cozy one, and only a few team members 
go along to conduct the tests. It’s a big deal that involves engineers from the 
manufacturer, wind tunnel engineers, and team owners. In fact, from time to 
time, NASCAR officials impound several NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars after 
a race and take them to the wind tunnel themselves in their ongoing efforts 
to keep the cars as equal as possible. They make sure to bring at least one 
car from each manufacturer — which means at least one Chevy, one Ford, one 
Dodge, and one Toyota. These NASCAR tests are different than the private tests 
teams conduct in the wind tunnel. In private tests, the teams and the manufac-
turer are the only ones to see the data — and they pay for that right, too. Wind 
tunnel time is very expensive, costing about $16,000 for an eight-hour test.
In the group tests, though, NASCAR foots the bill and shares the data with all 
four manufacturers, just to give them information on whether they’re ahead 
or behind in the area of aerodynamics. It also helps NASCAR keep the four 
cars in the same ballpark so it can maintain parity among the cars. If one car 
has great aerodynamics and another one doesn’t, the sleeker car would likely 
win all the superspeedway races — and that wouldn’t excite fans very much.

189
 Chapter 14: Get ting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
Testing at the race track
With all the pressures and forces affecting the way a car drives, NASCAR driv-
ers and teams have to know a lot about physics. They use that knowledge 
during wind tunnel tests and also at track tests where teams test different 
body shapes and spoiler heights in order to find a car’s maximum speed and 
best aerodynamic setup. At superspeedways, though, the tests are the most 
nervewracking because aerodynamics plays such a crucial role there. Teams 
gather information such as lap times, corner speeds, and suspension settings 
to figure out how to make their cars faster. While the body has to be nearly 
perfect for the car to cut through the air efficiently, the suspension package 
must be nearly perfect, too, so that the car can hug the ground as much as 
possible.
Tackling Rough-and-Tumble Short Tracks
While cars have to be nearly impeccable to win superspeedway races, the 
opposite applies to short-track races. Cars can, and have, limped into Victory 
Lane battered and banged up but still victorious.
 
Short tracks are less than 1 mile in length, so aerodynamics and horsepower 
aren’t particularly important in winning the race. Because the track is so 
short, there’s not much room to accelerate and get into open air, so some-
times drivers are on the brake almost as much as they’re on the gas. Also, with 
little room for cars to move around, short-track races are filled with bumping 
and banging. Many times, you see the winning race car roll into Victory Lane 
The driver makes the difference
The car used in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
has put a big emphasis on the driver. With the 
old car — used prior to 2007 — the crew chief 
could more easily tinker with parts to increase 
downforce and speed. That made it a lot easier 
for the driver, who could strap in and drive the 
car around on what essentially was a rail. The 
new car is a lot tougher to drive and makes the 
drivers prove why they’re the best stock-car 
drivers in the world. And if the crew chief does 
try to tinker with some of the parts, heavy penal-
ties will likely follow if he’s caught. For instance, 
in 2007, Dale Earnhardt, Jr.’s team tried to fool 
with the rear wing. They were caught, Earnhardt 
was docked 100 points, and his crew chief was 
suspended for six races.

with a bunch of dents, scratches, and tire marks on it. Even though the car 
may look pretty sad, it was still strong enough to survive a short-track race — 
and surviving is the key to winning.
The following speedways are the short tracks in the NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series. These are the places where cars are bound to get a beating before the 
race is over:
 
✓ Bristol Motor Speedway, a high-banked, .533-mile oval located in Bristol, 
Tennessee
 
✓ Martinsville Speedway, a nearly-flat, .526-mile oval located in Martinsville, 
Virginia
 
✓ Richmond International Raceway, a .75-mile, D-shaped track located 
in Richmond, Virginia
Short tracks, short tempers
The shorter the track, the less room the cars have to maneuver. And less room 
invites more contact among cars. So at short tracks, the etiquette changes a 
bit. Instead of passing someone on the outside or inside, some drivers opt for 
the bump-and-pass move (see Chapter 10 on racing strategies). A driver may 
nudge the car ahead of him out of the way by bumping its rear bumper to push 
it up the track. Sometimes cars get penalized for doing so, and sometimes they 
don’t. That’s the nature of short-track racing. It’s high contact, high temper, 
and high action crammed onto one tiny track.
While short-track racing is a lot of fun, it involves many accidents because 
cars don’t have much room to move around; they get all bunched up together. 
If one car spins out or loses control, the cars behind it may end up getting 
collected by the wreck because they have nowhere to go. Accidents happen 
really quickly at short tracks because the speeds are so fast and the tracks 
are so small. At Bristol, a car can circle the track in about 15 seconds. So 
when an accident happens, the cars behind the wreck can become a part of it 
in a fraction of a second.
Qualifying is particularly important at short tracks because passing on tracks 
so small is difficult. Even if a driver qualifies a decent 15th, he may be stuck 
there if he can’t find a way around the cars ahead of him. Most race winners 
at these tracks come from the top-ten qualifiers. Most drivers who don’t 
qualify in the top ten are cranky.

 Chapter 14: Get ting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
NASCAR’s roots
Short tracks are special places in NASCAR history because racing started 
there, and many drivers started their careers there. Way before NASCAR 
formed in 1948, short tracks ruled the racing world. There was no such thing 
as a superspeedway or even 1.5-mile tracks. (In fact, asphalt wasn’t that 
popular back then.) Those bigger tracks were too expensive to build, so track 
owners went with the plain and simple dirt track to get by — and those were 
the only tracks around. Sure, people always raced on the hard-packed sands 
of Daytona Beach, but in most parts of the nation, short tracks were all that 
race car drivers had. Drivers either raced on a short track, or they didn’t race 
at all. That’s how short tracks became so popular and how they provided a 
strong foundation for stock-car racing in America.
Combining Speed and Action 
at Intermediate Tracks
 
Not all race tracks in NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing are restrictor-plate 
superspeedways or short tracks. Plenty of tracks fall into a category between 
those two extremes, combining a diluted version of a superspeedway’s high 
speeds with the rubbing-and-bumping kind of racing found on a short track. 
Where stock-car drivers start out
Most NASCAR drivers start their careers driv-
ing on short tracks in the nation’s smaller stock-
car series, so short tracks are places many of 
us call home. People just don’t grow up learning 
how to drive on a 2.5-mile paved superspeed-
way or a high-banked intermediate track. There 
aren’t many around — and that’s probably 
a good thing because a driver needs to have 
certain skills before he or she drives on those 
tracks, anyway.
So, beginning race car drivers learn how to 
drive on small dirt tracks, where they hone 
their skills and improve their reaction times, and 
then they move up to bigger tracks through the 
years. Still, that doesn’t mean that short tracks 
are easier to drive — in fact, in many cases, 
they’re more difficult. Just because a driver 
has a good, fast car doesn’t necessarily mean 
he’ll be in Victory Lane at the end of the race. 
Short tracks require that drivers have keen driv-
ing skills to pass or to stay in front, so they’re a 
great place to learn the basics.
S

192
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
These combination tracks, which are usually oval tracks at least 1 mile but less 
than 2 miles long (with two exceptions: Pocono Raceway and Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway are each 2.5 miles long), are called intermediate tracks. (Keep in mind 
that NASCAR technically considers tracks 1 mile or more in length as super-
speedways, but that technical definition isn’t what drivers and teams go by.)
The following are the intermediate tracks in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series:
 
✓ Atlanta Motor Speedway, a 1.54-mile oval in Hampton, Georgia, just out-
side of Atlanta
 
✓ Auto Club Speedway (formerly California Speedway), a 2-mile oval in 
Fontana, California, near Los Angeles
 
✓ Chicagoland Speedway, a 1.5-mile oval in Joliet, Illinois, southwest 
of Chicago
 
✓ Darlington Raceway, a 1.366-mile, egg-shaped oval in Darlington, South 
Carolina
 
✓ Dover International Speedway, a 1-mile oval in Dover, Delaware
 
✓ Homestead–Miami Speedway, a 1.5-mile oval in Homestead, Florida, 
near Miami
 
✓ Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a 2.5-mile oval in Indianapolis, Indiana
  
✓ Kansas Speedway, a 1.5-mile oval in Kansas City, Kansas
 
✓ Las Vegas Motor Speedway, a 1.5-mile oval in Las Vegas, Nevada
  
✓ Lowe’s Motor Speedway (formerly Charlotte Motor Speedway), a 1.5-
mile oval in Concord, North Carolina, just north of Charlotte
 
✓ Michigan International Speedway, a 2-mile oval in Brooklyn, Michigan, 
outside of Detroit
 
✓ New Hampshire Motor Speedway, a 1.058-mile oval located in Loudon, 
New Hampshire
 
✓ Phoenix International Raceway, a 1-mile oval located in Avondale, 
Arizona, just outside of Phoenix
 
✓ Pocono Raceway, a 2.5-mile triangular track in Long Pond, Pennsylvania
 
✓ Texas Motor Speedway, a 1.5-mile oval located in Fort Worth, Texas
 
Even though NASCAR’s intermediate tracks are all comparable in size, that 
doesn’t mean they host the same kinds of races or are the same to drive on. 
Each race track has its own characteristics, such as high banking (when the 
racing surface is at an angle), bumpy racing surfaces, or difficult-to-negotiate 
turns. That’s what makes each intermediate track unique. And that’s what 
makes it challenging for drivers and interesting for fans.

 Chapter 14: Get ting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
Driving the Dreaded Road Courses
 
It’s not much of an exaggeration to say most NASCAR Sprint Cup Series drivers 
would rather call in sick than drive on a road course. Some drivers, however, are 
very skilled at road courses, including Jeff Gordon and Robby Gordon. For 
others, it’s just not what they’re used to. Road courses aren’t shaped like the 
four-turn and two-straightaway ovals are. They’re complex configurations of left 
and right turns of all sorts of angles. While some may be sweeping, gradual turns, 
others may be hairpin turns — which are drastic, sharply-angled turns that force 
drivers to slow down to a crawl. (These turns are shaped like a hairpin where 
drivers go into the turn traveling one direction and exit the turn going the 
opposite direction.) The whole point of it is that there’s no consistency to the 
course — sometimes drivers feel as though they’re driving through a great, 
big, hilly field; other times, they think they’re racing through a maze.
 
Instead of holding the throttle wide open the whole way around the track as a 
driver does on a superspeedway, racing on a road course entails a lot of shifts 
in speed — and a lot of shifting gears. The road courses require a lot of shifting 
because of the many turns and elevation changes during an event.
NASCAR travels to only two road courses each year, with one race at each of 
the tracks:
 
✓ Infineon Raceway, a 1.95-mile, 11-turn road course in Sonoma, California
 
✓ Watkins Glen International, a 2.45-mile, 11-turn road course in Watkins 
Glen, New York
Road course skills
Racing on road courses is a specialized skill for 
NASCAR drivers because they are so used to 
racing on circular tracks. So it’s understand-
able to see stock-car drivers freak out a bit 
when they show up at a track with long straight-
aways, short straightaways, wide turns, sharp 
turns, dips, and slopes. It’s just not what most 
stock-car drivers were trained to do. For me, 
though, driving on a road course comes more 
easily than for most stock-car drivers. In fact, 
it’s almost second nature.
I learned how to drive a car — not a go-kart, 
but a real car — when I was just 14. I drove my 
car as fast as it would go, not only on paved 
roads, but also on the hilly, curvy dirt roads of 
Arkansas. That’s where I fine-tuned my driv-
ing skills, such as how to control a car going 
through turns and how not to run into ditches 
(which was important because there were 
plenty of ditches around to run into). Those 
lessons have helped me through the years on 
all tracks, but particularly on road courses. I 
won three consecutive races at Watkins Glen 
International from 1993 to 1995, so I can’t com-
plain much. Other drivers can’t stand them.

Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
Racing under the Lights
While each NASCAR Sprint Cup Series track has its own appeal, some of the 
tracks have a special allure: night racing. While cars race the same way, the show 
they put on for fans is much different. When cars bottom out or crash against 
each other, sparks shoot into the air like fireworks. It’s quite a spectacle.
More and more tracks are installing lighting systems so that they can host 
night races, or so that rain-delayed events can be held at night, if need be. 
Currently, ten speedways host night NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events:
 
✓ Auto Club Speedway outside Los Angeles starts races in the afternoon, 
with drivers taking the checkered flag at night.
 
✓ Bristol Motor Speedway hosts night racing each summer at its second 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event of the season.
 
✓ Chicagoland Speedway ran its first night race in 2008.
 
✓ Darlington Raceway ended its 2004 race under the lights, but its first 
official night race was a year later, in 2005.
 
✓ Daytona International Speedway has a night race every July.
 
✓ Homestead–Miami Speedway’s season finale starts with the sun shining 
but ends under the lights.
 
✓ Lowe’s Motor Speedway hosts the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race in mid-
May and then holds the Coca-Cola 600 on Memorial Day weekend, which 
begins in the late afternoon and ends at night. The October race at 
Lowe’s is also held at night — and is the only scheduled night race in 
the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup.
 
✓ Phoenix International Raceway holds two races a year, the first of which, 
run in April, is under the lights.
 
✓ Richmond International Raceway holds night races every time NASCAR 
comes to the track.
 
✓ Texas Motor Speedway starts its November race in the afternoon and 
ends under the lights.
For the drivers, night racing has a slightly different feel from racing during 
the day. The lighting systems have become so good that drivers actually can 
see more of the track, including many of the bumps and dips of the racing 
surface. Also, night races are cooler than daytime racing, especially in the 
summertime — and comfort means a lot when you’re racing in (or watching) 
a three-hour race in the steam bath of Central Florida in July. The fans love 
night racing for the same reasons.

 Chapter 14: Get ting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
Finding Out Who Owns the Tracks
In the old days of stock-car racing, big-wig companies didn’t own race tracks — 
people did. Families or individuals with money or land built small tracks in their 
communities so that people could enjoy racing and watching races there. 
Now, though, individually owned race tracks, at least on the NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series level, aren’t common. The big companies have taken over.
Two large companies, both publicly owned with stock traded on the New 
York Stock Exchange, own most of the 22 tracks hosting NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series races: International Speedway Corporation (ISC) and Speedway 
Motorsports, Inc. (SMI).
Here are the owners of the 22 tracks in NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races:
 
✓ International Speedway Corporation, or ISC, as it’s known in the 
racing world, owns most of the tracks that host NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series races. ISC is based in Daytona Beach, Florida, and owns 
Auto Club Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway, Darlington Raceway, 
Daytona International Speedway, Homestead–Miami Speedway, Kansas 
Speedway, Martinsville Speedway, Michigan International Speedway, 
Phoenix International Raceway, Richmond International Raceway, 
Talladega Superspeedway, and Watkins Glen International.
Night moves
Night races often provide plenty of excitement, 
with all the sparks flying off the cars and the blur 
of colors racing by. But drivers and crews also 
find racing under the lights thrilling for another 
reason. Racing on Saturday nights gives us 
Sunday off. So we don’t mind that night races 
last until nearly midnight. After the races, we 
rush to our planes to get home as soon as pos-
sible, so we can go to sleep in our own beds and 
sleep late the next day. That gives us an extra 
day to spend with our families, go to our family 
church, run errands, or do things normal people 
do on weekends. It’s kind of weird waking up 
on Sunday with no race to drive in, but driv-
ers relish the moment, especially because our 
schedules are so packed during the week. It’s 
no wonder that my wife and son love Saturday 
night races, too!
For a fan, night racing isn’t too bad, either. After 
the race, you don’t have to drive or fly home 
early the next morning to be at work on time. 
You can relax in your hotel or campground for 
one more night, then leisurely get up the next 
morning and mosey all the way home without 
any stress.

Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
 
✓ Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (SMI) is NASCAR’s second-largest speedway 
owner. It is based in Concord, North Carolina, and O. Bruton Smith is 
the CEO. SMI owns Atlanta Motor Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway, 
Infineon Raceway, Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Lowe’s Motor Speedway, 
New Hampshire Motor Speedway, and Texas Motor Speedway.
 
✓ Dover Motorsports, Inc. runs the Dover International Speedway.
 
✓ The remaining two NASCAR Sprint Cup Series tracks are owned by families 
who have held onto their tracks and not sold out to huge companies yet:
 
• Indianapolis Motor Speedway is owned by the Hulman-George 
family (Hulman Co.).
 
• Pocono Raceway is owned by the Mattioli family.
Taking a Snapshot of Each 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Track
With 22 tracks in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, how do you choose which 
ones to go to? NASCAR weekends aren’t inexpensive (after including tickets, 
travel, food, and lodging), so you should consider your options carefully.
Do you like the bumping and banging of a short track? Do the high speeds 
of a superspeedway get you pumped up? Do the thrills of a night race on an 
intermediate track get your heart racing? If you’re not sure, watch a few races 
on television before you decide which track to go to. This section gives you 
the specs on each of the tracks. (Check out Chapter 9 for a description of the 
different track shapes.)
 
After you decide which track you like the best, call for tickets right away. 
Many times, races are sold out months — or even a year — in advance! The 
same goes for making hotel reservations. Race fans tend to stay at the same 
hotel year after year, renewing their reservations before they leave to ensure 
they have a place to stay the next year. So, if you’re looking for lodging, 
start planning way in advance, perhaps by calling the local tourist bureau or 
Chamber of Commerce to see what’s available. Also, if you want to camp out 
at the track (in the infield or adjacent to the track), many facilities require 
reservations — call the track for information. (See Chapter 15 for more info on 
getting tickets and lodging.)

Atlanta Motor Speedway
Atlanta Motor Speedway hosts two NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events each 
year, one in the spring and one in the fall. Both events are lightning-fast 
because the track is high-banked and was repaved and reconfigured into a 
quad oval in 1997 (see Figure 14-1). The newly-paved track causes cars to 
stick to the track more so drivers can go faster through the turns without 
worrying about losing control. For example, Geoffrey Bodine set the track 
qualifying record in 1997, the first NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race after the 
track was repaved. He went a blistering 197.498 mph, which is ultra-fast and 
ultra-scary for a driver on a 1.54-mile track.
Track specs
 
✓ Shape: Quad-oval, which is a modified oval with two extra, very slight 
turns. Those turns are located partway down the frontstretch, one on 
each side of the start/finish line.
 
✓ Length: 1.54 miles.
 
✓ Banking: 24 degrees in the turns and 5 degrees in the straightaways.

Get to the race track extra early if you want to see the green flag fall; other-
wise, you may be listening to the beginning of the race on your car radio. Also, 
make sure to bring a raincoat to the spring race because it tends to rain — or 
perhaps even snow! — at some point during the weekend.
Auto Club Speedway
You’ll find only two NASCAR Sprint Cup Series tracks on the West coast, 
and Auto Club Speedway (formerly California Speedway) is one of them (see 
Figure 14-2). The track was built by legendary owner Roger Penske and is one 
of the snazziest tracks around. Drivers love it because it’s laid out the way 
many think a track should be: It’s a regular oval, not shaped like a dog’s hind 
leg. Also, the racing surface is nice and smooth, making it a dream to drive 
on. In fact, the entire facility is a dream. It has meticulously groomed grounds 
along with neat parking lots and grandstands. The track workers smile and 
wave, even when they have to get up at 4 a.m. and direct traffic all day. The 
traffic flow to and from the speedway isn’t too bad, either. It’s a great place to 
incorporate into a family vacation to Disneyland. The track hosts two events 
each season.
Track specs
 
✓ Shape: D-shaped oval.
 
✓ Length: 2 miles.

Bristol Motor Speedway
Even though Bristol is one of NASCAR’s tiniest tracks at a half-mile, it doesn’t 
lack action. Far from it. In fact, an improved speedway and grandstands and 
the intense on-track action have made it the hardest ticket to get on the circuit. 
The track has a concrete racing surface and the steepest banks on the circuit, 
with a neck-straining 36-degree banking in the turns (see Figure 14-3). People 
liken it to a Roman coliseum because more than 160,000 seats tower above 
the small track. Drivers describe racing at the track by comparing it to flying 
a Learjet around a clothes dryer or maneuvering a speed boat around a toilet. 
There’s not much room on the track, but there’s a whole lot of noise in the 
place — particularly with 43 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cars circling the track 
and the roar of the engines reverberating off the aluminum grandstands.

Bristol Motor Speedway
Bristol is nicknamed “The World’s Fastest Half-Mile” for a reason — cars lap 
the track in about 15 seconds. Blink a few times, and you’ve already missed 
the lead cars going by. The track hosts two NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events 
each year, one in the spring and another in late summer. The late summer 
event is held at night and is one of racing’s hottest tickets.

magazines or newspapers for somebody selling tickets. Bristol does reserve 
tickets for each season that you can enter a drawing for. Check out its Web site 
for more information. Or you can take your chances and head to Bristol with-
out tickets, hoping to bump into somebody hawking tickets near the track.
Chicagoland Speedway
One of the newest speedways in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Chicagoland 
Speedway has quickly become a favorite of the drivers (see Figure 14-4). In 
addition to being a modern facility, it’s close to some of the best restaurants 
in the country. While drivers don’t have much time to act as tourists, they 
enjoy visiting the city and taking in its sites and sounds when they can. Since 
the track’s opening in 2001, Kevin Harvick and Tony Stewart have been the 
men to beat. Both have notched two victories at Chicagoland. Stewart (con-
sidered by many Midwesterners to be a hometown boy) went to Victory Lane 
in 2004 and 2007.

Darlington Raceway
Darlington is one of NASCAR’s oldest and most ornery tracks. It was built in 
1950 and is NASCAR’s original superspeedway. Over the years, it earned a 
nickname as “The Track Too Tough to Tame,” and there’s a good reason for 
that. Most drivers can’t tame it — and many drivers have trouble driving it.
The speedway is egg-shaped, meaning one end has tighter turns (turns one 
and two) than the other end (turns three and four); see Figure 14-5. The 
banking on the end with the tighter turns is 2 degrees steeper than the other 
end. Drivers have to pay attention to keep from smacking into the wall. Then 
again, smacking the wall at a storied place like Darlington is part of a NASCAR 
driver’s rite of passage. Driving close to the wall is mandatory. Your car drifts 
up the groove on the race track and ends up only inches from the wall, many 
times scraping it and leaving a stripe on the car from the wall’s paint. Over 
the years, that stripe has become known as the Darlington Stripe — and every 
driver who has raced there has earned it, whether he’s a rookie or a veteran.

Although Darlington isn’t near a big city like the Auto Club Speedway and 
doesn’t have sky boxes, it has its own history. Starting in 2005, Darlington 
started the tradition of racing the Saturday night before Mother’s Day.
Track specs
 
✓ Shape: Egg-shaped oval.
 
✓ Length: 1.366 miles.
 
✓ Banking: 25 degrees in turns one and two, 23 degrees in turns three and 
four, and 3 degrees on the straightaways.
Date to watch
The Saturday of Mother’s Day weekend.
Getting to the track
The track is in Darlington, South Carolina, about 75 miles east of Columbia 
and 10 miles north of Florence. To get there from I-95, take Highway 52 to 
Darlington. From I-20, take 401 east to Darlington. The track is on Highway

A preponderance of pond
Why is Darlington shaped so strangely? Well, 
at first it wasn’t to make the track challeng-
ing for drivers. When building the track, the 
original owner, Harold Brasington, wanted his 
speedway to have sweeping turns all the way 
around, but a local farmer refused to sell his fish 
pond — the one that sat right in the way of one 
end of the proposed track — so Brasington had 
to squeeze that end of the track to fit it in the 
allocated spot. He also had to make the banking 
steeper on that end to make the turn easier for 
drivers to negotiate. Years later, the fish pond 
is still there, and the track still boasts its weird 
shape. Good for the fish, tough for the drivers.

When buying tickets to a Darlington race, try to get seats close to the turns 
because a lot of the action happens there. You also may want to plan a trip to 
the beach during your weekend at Darlington: Myrtle Beach is only 70 miles 
away, where you can play mini-golf, body surf, or race go-karts at the NASCAR 
SpeedPark.
Daytona International Speedway
Daytona International Speedway is the most famous track in NASCAR 
racing, mostly because Daytona Beach is where NASCAR began. Even before 
NASCAR was founded, race car drivers would flock to Daytona’s hard-packed 
sand beaches to go head-to-head against each other while trying to avoid the 
incoming tide. Now, though, those drivers and millions of fans each year flock 
to the 2.5-mile superspeedway a few miles inland from where NASCAR stock-
car racing started (see Figure 14-6).

Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
The high-banked, high-speed track hosts two official NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series races each year: the Daytona 500 and the Coke Zero 400, formerly 
known as the Firecracker 400. The track also holds the Budweiser Shootout, 
which is a non-points race about a week before the Daytona 500 featuring the 
top six teams from each of the four manufacturers: Chevy, Ford, Dodge, and 
Toyota.
 
For the most part, race fans don’t just show up in Daytona Beach the day 
before the Daytona 500 because there’s plenty to see before the big event. The 
track hosts more than two weeks of racing each February, a time of the year 
known as Speedweeks. The annual series of events starts out with the Rolex 24 
at Daytona, a sports-car endurance race. The stock-car portion kicks off with 
pole qualifying and the Budweiser Shootout. The NASCAR Camping World 
Truck Series and the NASCAR Nationwide Series have their season-opening 
events — followed by the Daytona 500 on the final Sunday of Speedweeks.
In 1998, the track decided to give competitors and fans a break from the July 
heat, scheduling the summer Coke Zero 400 in the evening.
Track specs
 
✓ Shape: Tri-oval.
 
✓ Length: 2.5 miles.
 
✓ Banking: 31 degrees in the turns, 18 in the tri-oval (frontstretch), and 
3 degrees in the back straightaway.
Dates to watch
Mid-February and Fourth of July weekend.
Getting to the track
The track is in Daytona Beach, Florida, about 70 miles northeast of Orlando. 
From Orlando, take I-4 east to Daytona and exit on U.S. 92 or West 
International Speedway Boulevard. From I-95, take the U.S. 92 exit toward

If you plan on bringing your family to Daytona Beach for the races, you’ll find 
there are plenty of things to do in the area. Orlando, with Walt Disney World 
and Universal Studios, is just an hour away. The beach is just east of the 
speedway. But if you’re in town, you really don’t want to miss the Daytona 
500 Experience, a motorsports attraction right in front of the speedway that’s 
part NASCAR museum, part interactive funhouse. You can watch movies, play 
video games, and even participate in a real pit stop. Tours of the speedway 
also are available, so even if you don’t get into the infield on race day, you can 
see everything up close beforehand. Call 904-947-6800.
Dover International Speedway
Dover’s 400-mile NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races are among the most gruel-
ing on the circuit. Drivers often have their hands full racing on the high-banked 
track known for being a monster because of its ability to bend up race cars 
(see Figure 14-7). For the fans, the “Monster Mile” has become a popular 
motorsports destination in the Mid-Atlantic region with new, fan-friendly 
NASCAR’s Super Bowl
The Daytona 500, held at Daytona International 
Speedway each February, is the most famous 
stock-car race in the world. It’s NASCAR’s 
Super Bowl and is the race every driver dreams 
of winning. Why is it such a big deal? Not only 
does it pay the most money, but it also has the 
most prestige.
Some of the most legendary drivers in the world 
have won the event, including Richard Petty (a 
record seven times!), Cale Yarborough, and 
even Indy 500 winners Mario Andretti and A.J. 
Foyt. Dale Earnhardt considered it the biggest 
feather in his cap, and son Dale Earnhardt, Jr. 
added it to his resume in 2004.
If you win the Daytona 500, not only do you join 
that elite group of drivers, but you also get loads 
of fame. The winner goes on a whirlwind media 
tour the week after making it to the famed 
Victory Lane, making appearances on national 
TV shows like Late Night with David Letterman 
and Live! With Regis and Kelly. So, if you’re not 
famous when you win it, you will be by the time 
the week is over.
Winning the Daytona 500 is quite an experience 
because about 200,000 fans watch it in person 
and millions of people watch it on TV, but there’s 
something even more special about winning 
the 500-mile race. The driver who wins it feels 
pretty darn good about his upcoming season — 
the Daytona 500 kicks off the NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series season every year, and doing well in 
the race boosts a driver’s (and his team’s) con-
fidence heading into the rest of the season.

enhancements including an 8-acre FanZone area and the “biggest attraction 
in NASCAR,” a 46-foot Monster Monument at Victory Plaza. The monster 
sculpture features the track’s signature icon, Miles the Monster, holding a 
full-scale stock car high above fans below on the newly developed Victory 
Plaza grand entranceway. It’s a photo opportunity waiting to happen.
Two- and three-wide action at speeds in excess of 160 mph is a fixture at 
Dover — a track that many people compare to a short track. (Some fans call 
it a big Bristol.)

Homestead–Miami Speedway
The 1.5-mile track south of Miami (see Figure 14-8) used to be called the Metro-
Dade Homestead Motorsports Complex, but it was renamed the Homestead–
Miami Speedway in mid-1998, just before NASCAR Sprint Cup Series’ first race 
there in November 1999. When NASCAR hit south Florida, it was quite a culture 
clash. NASCAR has a distinctly southern, old-fashioned twinge to it. South 
Florida, on the other hand, is known for its international flair and the cutting-
edge fashion of the South Beach area. But NASCAR race car drivers and fans 
seemed to enjoy the trip south anyway, especially because of the weather in 
Homestead, which is normally mild in late November. Many NASCAR Nationwide 
Series competitors stay there for vacations after they’re done racing because 
the series’ season finale is there. Homestead also holds the series finale for the 
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series.

When booking a hotel in the Homestead area, you may be tempted to search 
in and around Miami, but don’t forget to look south of the speedway, too. The 
Florida Keys are just over 45 minutes south of the track, and staying there 
gives you the opportunity to enjoy gorgeous blue ocean waters and white 
sand beaches while still staying relatively close to the track. Also, after the 
race most of the traffic flows north to Miami, so by staying in the Keys, your 
trip back may be easier.
Indianapolis Motor Speedway
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, nicknamed the “Brickyard” because its racing 
surface used to be paved with bricks, is hallowed grounds for IndyCar 
racing. It was built in 1909 and is the oldest continuously operating track 
in the world. The Brickyard became legendary for hosting the Indianapolis 
500, the nation’s marquee event for open-wheel Indy cars, where more than 
400,000 fans pack into the grandstands and infield. Because the track is such 
an IndyCar Series racing icon, many people thought hell would freeze over 
before stock cars raced on the track.
Well, as it turned out, hell did freeze over. In 1994, the NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series competed at the Brickyard for the first time, breaking tradition at the 
2.5-mile track (see Figure 14-9). Now, the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard is one 
of NASCAR’s most prestigious races.

212
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
When NASCAR comes to the Brickyard, the race is technically a sell-
out, although there is no room for fan motor homes in the infield. There 
are almost 300,000 fans in the grandstands to see the Allstate 400 at the 
Brickyard — which makes it the biggest race, in terms of fan attendance, on 
the NASCAR circuit. Drivers get to see those fans, too. The turns are nearly 90 
degrees, making it seem as if you’re going to drive right into the grandstands 
before easing off the throttle to turn drastically left. It’s scary, especially 
for rookies who aren’t used to the sharp turns, high speeds on the straight-
aways, and racing on the narrow speedway. As a driver, you just have to get 
used to it before you feel comfortable, which may take a few years because 
NASCAR races only once a year at the speedway.
Track specs
 
✓ Shape: Four-cornered oval, which is nearly a rectangle because the 
turns are almost at 90-degree angles.
 
✓ Length: 2.5 miles.
 
✓ Banking: 9 degrees in the turns and flat straightaways.
Date to watch
Late July.
Getting to the track
The track is in a town called Speedway located about 7 miles northwest of 
downtown Indianapolis. To get there, take Exit 16A (the Speedway/Clermont 
exit) off I-465 west; then go east on 16th Street to the track.
Getting tickets
Tickets for the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard are primarily sold by mail order. 
Call 317-484-6700 for an order form or write to P.O. Box 24152, Speedway, IN 
46224. The race sells out quickly, so you must call or write for an order form 
at least one month before the race if you want to get tickets. In addition, tick-
ets may be available through the speedway’s Web site at www.brickyard.

Infineon Raceway
For mellow, wine-drinking race fans, Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California, 
may be the quintessential venue (see Figure 14-10). The track, located in the 
heart of Sonoma Valley’s wine country, is a twisting, turning road course with 
as many elevation changes as there are wineries nearby. Drivers have to deal 
with sharp turns, dips, and hills throughout the race, so it’s exhausting as 
much as it is demanding.
 
Fans have it altogether different. They are spread throughout the hills sur-
rounding the track, drinking wine, snacking, and cavorting while watching the 
race. You can find some grandstand seating, but not much, so be prepared to 
bring a blanket and food so you can chill out while your wine chills. Then you 
can watch the race and enjoy the spectacular scenery of the valley. The track 
hosts one NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race each year.

Don’t expect to see the entire race track if you’re going to an event at 
Infineon. The track is so big and has so many dips and turns that there’s just 
no way to see the whole thing. So, when hunkering down to watch the race 
from the hillside, try to pick a place where you’ll see at least one of the turns. 
That’s where you’ll find a lot of the action on a road course because a lot of 
passing is done there.
Kansas Speedway
Kansas Speedway, which started hosting NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races in 
2001, plays host to 80,000 fans and has quickly become a driver favorite (see 
Figure 14-11). Located in the heart of the United States, Kansas Speedway is a 
favorite of multiple winner Jeff Gordon (2001 and 2002) and 2003 winner Ryan 
Newman. Although drivers enjoy racing on tracks with a long history, there 
also is excitement that comes from racing at a new venue. At Kansas, the 
accommodations are excellent, including a top-of-the-line garage area and a 
smooth track surface.

Las Vegas Motor Speedway
If you’re a race fan who loves nightlife, Las Vegas Motor Speedway is your mecca 
for NASCAR racing. During the day, you get to watch great racing on a track that 
drivers love because there’s plenty of room to drive (see Figure 14-12). Drivers 
can run on the bottom, in the middle, or on top — which is great because, as 
you’ve probably figured out, race car drivers love having a lot of room to work 
with so they can pass the cars in front of them. While you’re watching the racing, 
you can’t help but notice the track’s breathtaking surroundings. The McCullough 
Mountain Range is in the distance, plus Nellis Air Force Base isn’t far, either, 
often providing a free air show of F-14s flying in formation.

 Chapter 14: Get ting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
After you’re done watching racing, you can get out of your race track duds, put 
on a fancy-schmancy outfit, and explore the town. Las Vegas is nicknamed “The 
Entertainment Capital of the World” because of its dozens of casinos, hundreds 
of restaurants, and smorgasbord of shows. But don’t stay out too late the night 
before the race because traffic to the track is challenging. You’ll have to get there 
early to avoid starting your day with congestion on the roads — and to avoid a 
headache, too. Also, make sure to get your fill of Vegas before the weekend is 
through. The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stops there only once a year. But you 
can get your NASCAR fix later in the year, too — the NASCAR Camping World 
Truck Series races at Las Vegas in September.
Track specs
 
✓ Shape: D-shaped oval.
 
✓ Length: 1.5 miles.
 
✓ Banking: 20 degrees in the turns, 9 degrees on the frontstretch, and 
9 degrees on the backstretch.
Date to watch

Getting to the track
The track is located in Las Vegas, 11 miles from the heart of the Vegas Strip. 
To get there, take I-15 north to exit 54 for Speedway Boulevard.

When Vegas nightlife gets too expensive, perhaps a more down-to-earth 
option is sticking around the speedway. There’s a dirt track around the corner 
from the track, where you can see even more racing after the NASCAR garages 
close for the evening. Those races, held under the lights, don’t host NASCAR 
cars. They have other cars and other series, including the World of Outlaws 
Series, which features sprint cars with a large wing on top.

Lowe’s Motor Speedway
Most NASCAR Sprint Cup Series drivers live in the Charlotte, North Carolina, 
area, so it’s no wonder they love racing at Lowe’s Motor Speedway. Three 
times per year, many drivers get to sleep in their own beds on race weekends 
instead of in a hotel or their motor homes. Drivers also like the track because 
you can pass on it and go very fast (see Figure 14-13).

Lowe's Motor Speedway
The 1.5-mile track, formerly known as Charlotte Motor Speedway, was the 
first NASCAR track to change its name because owners sold its naming rights. 
Expect many more tracks to change their names in the future due to bigger 
money being offered by companies to sponsor a track. But, whatever the 
name of the track, the facility hasn’t lost any of its glitz. It has many luxury 
sky boxes just as other tracks do, but it also has two condominiums built 
at one end of the track, where many drivers and fans own condos overlook-
ing the race track. How exciting it must be to wake up in your own condo in 
the morning and glance out your window to see a group of gritty race teams 
testing their cars. Or just think, you can have a dinner party and watch races 
while nibbling on hors d’oeuvres and sipping on chardonnay. You’ll also find 
the ritzy Speedway Club at the track, which is racing’s version of a country 
club. It’s a concept dreamed up by Speedway Motorsports CEO O. Bruton 
Smith and former speedway president H.A. “Humpy” Wheeler, two of the 
most innovative, creative promoters in the sport.

 Chapter 14: Get ting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
In addition to hosting the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race each May, Lowe’s 
Motor Speedway hosts two NASCAR Sprint Cup Series events each year, 
including the Coca-Cola 600 on Memorial Day weekend. Lowe’s Motor 
Speedway plays host to approximately 160,000 fans.

If you want to see race teams up close, you can drive to some (or even all, if 
you’re so inclined) of the race shops in the Charlotte area (see Chapter 16 for 
race shop addresses). You won’t have a hard time finding one because they’re 
everywhere. The best place to see a group of shops in one visit is Mooresville, 
known as “Race City U.S.A.,” which is about 20 miles north of the track. Take 
exit 36 off I-77 north, go over the highway, and turn left at your first light. Drive 
down that group of streets, including Rolling Hills Road and Knob Hill Road, 
and you’ll find more race shops than you can visit in one day, including Roush 
Fenway Racing and Penske Racing South. Most race shops have a free visitors’ 
area, where you can take a peek at the race teams preparing cars. Many also 
have souvenir shops.

Martinsville Speedway
Martinsville’s .526-mile oval is the tiniest track in NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
racing and also is the oldest (see Figure 14-14). It was built in 1947 and even 
predates NASCAR itself. Good old Martinsville is a typical short track with 
not much room to pass and a bumpy racing surface. The tricky part is that 
it’s concrete through the turns and asphalt in the straightaways. Some driv-
ers lovingly call it two drag strips attached by two U-turns. Some just call 
it frustrating. With little room to get by the car in front of them, drivers 
know they must qualify well in order to have a decent finish. But qualifying 
well doesn’t exempt you from finishing the race unscathed. Even though 
Martinsville isn’t high banked the way Bristol is, cars still get bumped and 
banged during the race. There just isn’t anywhere to hide, especially when 
somebody spins out or wrecks just in front of you.

Humpy’s pre-race festivities
Humpy Wheeler, who retired as president of 
Lowe’s Motor Speedway in 2008, was known 
especially for his pre-race festivities, which 
bordered on the outrageous. Some of the events 
were unforgettable. For instance, before the 
Coca-Cola 600 (formerly the World 600) each 
year, he called in the National Guard to perform 
a military exercise, filled with loud booms and 
plenty of billowing smoke.
Wheeler has had some brilliant ideas over the 
years, including the NASCAR Sprint All-Star 
Race each May, which features NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series winners. The all-star race has differ-
ent rules and is not an official points event.
Even though Wheeler has retired, you can 
bet his legacy will live on. No doubt the new 
president — Marcus Smith, son of SMI CEO O. 
Bruton Smith — will follow in Wheeler’s foot-
steps as far as a fan-friendly experience goes.

you may want to steer clear.
Michigan International Speedway
With Detroit just about an hour away, executives from the car companies 
don’t have to travel far to see some of the best racing in the sport. That’s 
because many race car drivers deem Michigan International Speedway one 
of the best tracks they drive on (see Figure 14-15). There’s plenty of room 
to race on the speedway’s wide straightaways and turns, making it easy for 
drivers to take the low route, the high route, or any route they choose to 
get by somebody in front of them. Michigan is also one of the fastest tracks 
in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series because of the long straightaways and the 
relatively high banking. And unlike cars at Daytona and Talladega, cars at 
Michigan don’t have to use restricted motors that cut down on horsepower 
and speed.
Many times, races at the 2-mile Michigan oval come down to a battle of which 
team gets the best fuel mileage, which team pumps out the fastest pit stop, 
and which team has the best pit strategy.

Because races at Michigan International Speedway don’t have many cautions 
and accidents, the best place to see the most action is from the north grand-
stands. Sitting there gives you a good vantage point to see the cars exit turn 
three, enter turn four, and then barrel down the frontstretch.
New Hampshire Motor Speedway
Yes, there’s hope for New Englanders who want to see a NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series race but don’t want to drive all over creation to do it — a 1-mile track 
in Loudon, New Hampshire. The speedway (see Figure 14-16) is a huge ver-
sion of the Martinsville Speedway. It has sharp turns, a slick racing surface, 
long straightaways, and not enough room in the corners to pass the cars in 
front, even if the car in back is much faster. In fact, there isn’t much room to 
pass anywhere on the track, which is why qualifying up front is so important.

The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races at the track twice a year: once in the 
summer when the nights are much cooler and crisper than in the steamy 
south and once in the fall just as leaves on the trees start to turn colors. The 
fall race is the first race in the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, which is 
when NASCAR’s top 12 drivers begin contending for the championship.
By the way, race car drivers never call the track New Hampshire Motor 
Speedway. It’s just called “Loudon,” short and sweet. (There are too many 
syllables in New Hampshire Motor Speedway, and drivers are always in a 
rush, rush, rush.)

Phoenix International Raceway
With the majestic Sierra Estrella Mountains in the background, Phoenix 
International Raceway is one of the most picturesque tracks in NASCAR 
racing. It’s also one of the most oddly shaped tracks (see Figure 14-17). 
Instead of being a plain old oval, Phoenix is shaped like a reverse “D” because 
the track’s owner didn’t want to alter the facility’s road course to accommo-
date an oval.

Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
 
Phoenix isn’t a high-banked track, and the turns are tricky because turns one 
and two have different degrees of banking than turns three and four. Each 
turn is challenging. Turns one and two are tight, with the wall coming out of 
nowhere as you come out of turn two. Turns three and four are more sweep-
ing, with a subtle turn (or dogleg) in the backstretch just to make things more 
interesting. The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series drivers race here twice each year.

✓ Shape: D-shaped oval.
 
✓ Length: 1 mile.

relatively inexpensive, and parking is nearby, which makes hillside seating the 
best buy at the raceway. Bring a blanket and binoculars if you plan to park 
yourself on the hill.
Pocono Raceway
Pocono’s triangular race track, tucked into the Pocono Mountains (a haven 
for honeymooners in the northeast), may very well be the most difficult and 
frustrating track in NASCAR. It isn’t a regular oval, a D-shaped oval, a road 
course, or a superspeedway. It’s a combination of all those tracks. It has 
three straights, each a different length, and three corners, each a different 
length and with a different level of banking (see Figure 14-18). It rivals any 

227
 Chapter 14: Get ting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
superspeedway for pure speed because of its long front straightaway, which 
is one of the longest straight stretches of road in NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
racing. Cars can reach 200 mph as they barrel down that straight. Going into the 
turns, though, cars aren’t going that fast. That’s where Pocono the superspeed-
way turns into Pocono the road course because the turns are so different.

teristics of

course and

its unique 
shape and

turns.
 
Pocono Raceway
The most heart-stopping turn at Pocono is turn two, known as the “tunnel 
turn” because the tunnel into the infield is beneath the turn. It’s also consid-
ered the toughest turn in racing. The groove in the tunnel turn is extremely 
narrow, so cars must negotiate the turn single file. If they don’t, they’ll end 
up smacking into the wall. It’s also a relatively flat turn, which makes it tough 
to negotiate because the cars are still going really fast after the trip down the 
long frontstretch and through the banked first turn. Turn three is relatively 
easier. It’s a wider turn with more racing room.
With those three very different turns on the same course, drivers and teams 
have to set up their cars carefully. They must learn to make compromises 
in order to get the best out of their vehicles through each lap. Sometimes, 
teams choose to set up their cars for turn three so the driver is better

Looking for an autograph of your favorite driver? On the way from the garage 
to pit road, there’s a small grandstand where fans with pit passes can sit and 
wait for a glimpse of drivers and crews. It’s called “autograph alley” because 
there are a few windows built into the fence in front of the stands, where fans 
can hand drivers hats, T-shirts, programs, and other souvenirs to sign. Sit 
there long enough, and a driver is bound to come by and oblige you. Also, if 
you have a bunch of spare time during the race weekend, head to the city — 
New York City. Pocono is the closest track to New York City, which is about 
two hours away.
Richmond International Raceway
Many drivers consider Richmond International Raceway the best short track 
in NASCAR. Some even call it the perfect track. Even though it’s only three-
quarters of a mile long, there’s still enough room for you to race up high,

 Chapter 14: Get ting the Lowdown on Each NASCAR Track
down low, or in the middle (see Figure 14-19). If drivers want to make a pass, 
they can do so anywhere they want instead of waiting for a wide enough 
spot on the race track. While drivers love the place, fans don’t think it’s too 
shabby, either. It hosts two nighttime NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races each 
year, becoming electric with the cars circling the race track under the lights. 
When fans snap photographs, the flashbulbs make the grandstand look as 
if it’s filled with fireflies. And when the drivers race, their cars throw sparks 
into the air to electrify the night even more. The fall race is where top-12 driv-

and exciting race for all those on the Chase bubble.

Talladega Superspeedway
According to legend, Talladega is haunted because it was built on an old 
Native American burial ground. There’s no doubt that Talladega is the big-
gest, meanest, and fastest track in NASCAR racing. Bill Elliott set the speed 
record for stock cars in 1987 when he won the pole for the Winston 500 with 
a 212.809 mph lap. That was before NASCAR mandated carburetor restrictor 
plates (see Chapter 6) to slow down the cars. In other words, that record will 
likely never be broken.

the racing surface. But after millions of dollars of renovations and reconfigu-

Watkins Glen International
Unlike Infineon Raceway, Watkins Glen International is more of a modified 
oval with mostly right turns instead of left turns (see Figure 14-22). It also 
doesn’t have the drastic sharp turns of Infineon Raceway, so cars can lap the 
track much faster. One of the best things about “the Glen,” as it’s affection-
ately called, is that fans can get a great view of the track by perching them-
selves at various points around the speedway. Still, you can’t see the entire 
track because it sprawls so much. The track hosted Formula One racing’s 
U.S. Grand Prix from 1961 to 1980, but now its biggest race is when NASCAR 
comes to the tiny town in the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York.

Just like at Infineon, the best seats at Watkins Glen are near the turns where 
drivers most often make their moves. The esses is a part of the track where 
cars snake through the course in a series of turns, and it’s an especially good

The stand-alone tracks
There are only 22 tracks on the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series schedule, and 
while they’re spread out across the country, it’s impossible to have a race in 
every city in the United States. If you didn’t see a track that’s close to you in 
the above list, there may be a stand-alone race at a track that is near you. A 
stand-alone race is a NASCAR Nationwide Series or NASCAR Camping World 
Truck Series race that doesn’t have the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series as a com-
panion during the weekend.
The following tracks host stand-alone races: Nashville Superspeedway, Iowa 
Speedway, Kentucky Speedway, The Milwaukee Mile, Gateway International 
Raceway, O’Reilly Raceway Park at Indianapolis, Circuit Gilles Villeneuve 
(Montreal), Memphis Motorsports Park, and Mansfield (Ohio) Motorsports 
Park.

G
oing to a NASCAR race isn’t like going to a professional basketball 
game. It’s more like going to Woodstock. Fans make pilgrimages to 
NASCAR races, sometimes driving across the country to their favorite tracks. 
And when they get there, they enter a unique universe.
Often, NASCAR fans camp out on speedway grounds or near the speedway 
before an event. They bring their tents, motor homes, campers, and vans to 
the track and then party like there’s no tomorrow. You think tailgating before 
a college football game is a blast? Well, you haven’t seen anything unless 
you’ve trekked to a NASCAR race. From 70,000 to 270,000 fans descend on 
NASCAR tracks during race weekends. They bring their NASCAR hats, 
NASCAR T-shirts, NASCAR flags, and NASCAR bumper stickers. But most of 
all, they bring their loyalties to their favorite NASCAR drivers. While fans at 
basketball games cheer for one team or the other, fans at NASCAR races are 
cheering for 43 different drivers.
If you decide you have to be part of this mania, this chapter’s for you. I 
tell you everything you need to know about having a great race weekend, 
including how to find tickets and lodging, how early to arrive to the track, 
what to bring on race day, and how to behave.

Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
Getting Your Tickets for a Race
Before you head to a NASCAR race, you want to have tickets for the event in 
hand. This section explains various ways to get tickets and also helps you 
decide what tickets you want to get.
Tips on buying tickets
Some races sell out weeks or months before the event, so tickets can be hard 
to find. They can also be quite pricey, ranging from $25 to more than $250. 
Keep in mind that some tracks sell discounted tickets for children. (See 
Chapter 14 for information on how to get tickets at each of the NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series tracks.) Here are some tips for getting tickets to events:
 
✓ Call the track ticket office as soon as possible, even a year before 
an event, to get information on securing tickets for the race you want 
to see.
 
 Tickets for races go on sale long before the event, so if you call early, 
you increase your chances of going to an event (and getting the best 
seats). If the race is sold out, some tracks can put you on a waiting 
list just in case more seats open up. Or you can stay on the waiting list 
until a season-ticket holder decides to give up his or her tickets.
 
✓ Buy tickets from a track’s Web site. (See Chapter 14 for Web site 
addresses for each NASCAR Sprint Cup Series track.) Sometimes, tracks 
reserve chunks of seats and save them for Internet-based customers. 
Plus, you won’t have to wait on hold while all the good seats get 
bought up.
 
 If a race does sell out, check out Web sites like www.ebay.com, www.
stubhub.com, and www.craigslist.com. Often, fans who buy tickets 
but realize they can’t attend the race will sell their seats on these sites.
 
✓ Flip through the classified section of your local newspaper or a 
national racing publication. Fans sell their tickets to sold-out races all 
the time, so if you keep your eyes open for tickets to the race or race 
track of your dreams, you may get lucky.
 
✓ Drive or walk around a race track to find fans selling their unused 
tickets. Sometimes, fans buy too many tickets and have extras on race 
day. But beware of scalpers who charge too much and put you at risk for 
buying counterfeit tickets.
 
Whenever you buy tickets from a place other than the race track, you’re taking 
your chances that the tickets may be outrageously priced or even counterfeit. 
Be aware that in most states, it’s illegal for people to sell tickets to an event if 
they aren’t properly licensed. In other states, it’s illegal for someone to charge 
more than face value for tickets. Still more states have laws about how much 

237
 Chapter 15: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track
a scalper can boost the ticket price over face value. It may be tiresome to 
find out what the local laws are regarding scalping tickets, but it’s worth it. 
Depending on the jurisdiction, you can get fined or even arrested for buying 
tickets illegally. To check on specific scalping laws, call that state’s Chamber 
of Commerce or the police department located closest to the track.
Grandstands or infield?
When buying NASCAR tickets, at some tracks you have the option of getting 
tickets for the grandstands or for the infield. Each location gives you a 
different feel of racing, and one is no better than the other — it just depends 
on what you want to get out of your trip to the race track.
Sitting in the grandstands
Most fans watch races from the grandstands. The grandstands give you the 
best view of the track, and you ensure yourself a seat because you purchase 
tickets for specific seats. It’s the traditional way to do things. It’s just like 
sitting in the stands at a football game, but much louder — not because of 
the people around you, but because of the roar of the engines as the cars go 
around the track. And you get to make friends with the person you’re sitting 
next to, whether you like it or not, because the seats are so close together.
 
Keep in mind that the best seats are the highest seats, which isn’t the case in 
most sporting events. Sitting up higher gives you a better view of the entire 
track, while sitting lower gives you a perfect view of cars zooming by — and 
that’s about it. All you see is a blur. So this is one sporting event where you 
don’t want to be in the front row.
Camping out in the infield
Not all tracks allow fans in the infield — particularly not the smaller ones. 
The tracks that do offer infield access, however, are packed not only on race 
day but also throughout the weekend with people camping out. Watching a 
race from the infield is an acquired taste. It’s a big party from the time the 
people stream in to the time the people trickle out. Sometimes, you wonder if 
they even notice whether the race is going on or not.
Most fans who choose the infield drive motor homes and park them as close 
to the track as possible. At larger tracks, the fans who drive their cars or 
motor homes into the infield watch the race from on top of their vehicles. 
Even from those vantage points though, fans usually can’t see the entire race 
track. You may see a bit of the frontstretch or a turn or two, but that’s it. The 
rest is up to your imagination — and your ears. All tracks broadcast the race 
over the public address system. So even if you can’t see the entire race, you 
can hear it.

238
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
 
Grandstand tickets usually sell out first, so you may find that the infield is 
your only option. But even though infield tickets don’t sell out as quickly, you 
should still contact the track ahead of time. If you plan to drive a vehicle into 
the infield, you need to actually buy two things: a parking pass and infield 
tickets for each person in the vehicle. If you have eight people stuffed in your 
Winnebago, you need eight tickets. While the tickets themselves are general 
admission (because there are no seats in the infield), many parking spaces 
and camping spaces in the infield can be reserved in advance. The reserved 
spots often sell out before the race comes to town. At Daytona International 
Speedway, for example, motor home spaces are reserved so that you have an 
exact place to set up camp. The track also has unreserved places, which are 
doled out on a first-come, first-served basis. As you can guess, the reserved 
spaces are more expensive and are in better spots inside the track than the 
unreserved spaces.
The best part about bringing your motor home, camper, or tent into the 
infield is that you get to sleep in it, so you’ll save money on lodging. While 
staying at a hotel may cost $200 a night (especially on race weekends when 
hotels tend to hike up their prices), staying in the infield may cost $250 for 
two nights. The prices for infield camping vary widely, though, depending on 
whether you get a reserved spot (which is more expensive) and how many 
spaces are available. So check with the track before driving down in your 
pop-up camper with $20 in your pocket.
 
Fans in the infield aren’t the types to show up on race day, watch the race, and 
then head dutifully home right after the checkered flag falls. They usually get 
to the race track two or three days in advance to set up their campers, motor 
homes, or tents, then slip into their pre-race partying mode. They bring gas 
grills (because many tracks don’t allow open fires in the camping areas), 
coolers filled with beverages, and lawn chairs, and then cavort like mad. Some 
cavort more during the race and keep cavorting even when the race is done. 
So, if you think you’re more apt to be a serious race-watcher who doesn’t like 
distractions during an event, the grandstands may be a better place for you.
What a suite deal
Above the grandstands at the majority of tracks 
are rows of boxes encased in glass where 
people gather to watch races. These are the 
suites, and you can’t buy tickets at the box office 
to sit in them. They’re for corporations or people 
with enough money to rent them out. Usually, 
companies rent the suites for thousands of 
dollars each race and then invite employees, 
colleagues, clients, friends, or family members 
to watch the race. All the suites have TVs, so you 
can see all the action, including replays of big 
wrecks or key passes. Most also have catered 
lunches or dinners, so you can dine in air-
conditioned comfort while the drivers bump and 
bang on the track. It’s a luxurious way to watch 
a race and a great way to entertain a group.

239
 Chapter 15: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track
The infield is pretty much an adult playground, so if you want to bring the 
family and make a weekend out of it, ask the track if it has a family camping 
area. Many tracks have staked out camping areas for families, complete with 
curfews and noise limits.
Finding Lodging Well in Advance
Suppose you have tickets to a NASCAR race and are ready to head to the 
event. If you’re making a day trip out of it, the only thing you need to worry 
about is traffic. If you want to stay for a night or two, you have a bigger 
challenge.
 
Finding a place to stay near a race track during a NASCAR race weekend may 
not be easy. Most race tracks aren’t located in large metropolitan areas with 
hotels on every corner. They’re in smaller places like Talladega, Alabama, or 
Dover, Delaware. There just aren’t that many hotel rooms available. Imagine 
100,000 or so race fans streaming into town and looking for a place to stay. As 
you can guess, space is tight.
Bring the kids
NASCAR is certainly a family sport, with par-
ticipants who don’t mind being role models and 
don’t do shocking things that athletes from 
other sports have been caught doing. I think it’s 
rare to find a sport like NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series racing these days, and I think that’s 
partly why parents aren’t afraid to bring their 
kids to the races. Families interested in going to 
NASCAR races should keep the following points 
in mind, however:
 ✓ It’s not the cheapest event that you can 
take your kids to. However, some tracks 
may have special, discounted tickets for 
younger children.
 ✓ It may not be a wholly G-rated experience. 
Although most NASCAR fans are well 
behaved, some aren’t.
 ✓ Drinking alcohol is allowed in the grand-
stands and in the infield, where fans have 
been known to carry coolers filled with a 
variety of beverages (although some tracks 
do have alcohol-free grandstands).
Not much gallivanting goes on during races, 
though. Much of it is contained to pre- and post-
race activities, so if you want to protect your 
children from that hubbub, show up at the race 
track and head straight for your seats.
Racing started out as a family sport for me back 
in Arkansas. Even though my parents were 
divorced, racing was one way my family 
would get together and have fun. So, some of 
my best memories with my family were at the 
race track.

240
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
 
Before taking off for a race with your spouse and children, call to make hotel 
reservations. The simplest way to find out what hotels have vacancies is to 
call the Chamber of Commerce or visitor’s bureau in the town where the 
race track is located. These organizations usually have a list of hotels with 
available rooms and can also suggest hotels in your price range. In Chapter 14, 
I provide phone numbers for organizations to contact for lodging information 
for each NASCAR Sprint Cup Series track.
Because the demand for lodging is so high, hotel rooms during race week-
ends generally aren’t cheap. Expect to pay up to $300 or $400 a night for a 
hotel room close to the track. But don’t expect to stay in luxury, even at 
those prices. Even the smallest hotels increase prices when so many race 
fans are looking for so few rooms.
Be aware that most hotels ask for three- or four-night minimums for race 
weekends, and many ask for a one-night deposit when you make the reserva-
tion. Of course, the farther away the hotel, the cheaper the room, so if you 
can’t bear to part with all that cash, just get in your car and drive an hour or 
so away from the track.
Recently, some tracks have worked with local hotels to lower prices and 
waive the minimum stay. Track promoters want as many fans to come to the 
races as possible, and they know that high hotel fees can keep them away. 
Some tracks, like Lowe’s Motor Speedway, have been successful. Many 
Charlotte-area hotels now don’t have price hikes and minimum stay rules 
during race weekends.
Buying a program
If you’re a novice NASCAR fan, buying a race 
program helps guide you through your after-
noon or evening. Programs usually contain 
stories about the top drivers or teams. They also 
have a list of drivers, which may contain 
biographical information, car number, team 
affiliation, and paint scheme (the design on a 
car). While some paint schemes, such as the 
one on Jeff Gordon’s multi-color No. 24 Chevy, 
stay virtually the same from year to year, some 
teams have ever-changing paint schemes. 
Keep that in mind when you’re looking for a car 
on the speedway. Sometimes looking for the 
car number, not the car color, is a better move.
Programs also may have race records, NASCAR 
records, and charts that translate lap times 
into miles per hour. As a beginner fan, all that 
information, for the price of about $10, can help 
you become a savvy NASCAR devotee.

241
 Chapter 15: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track
Arriving to the Race on Time
To avoid the bumper-to-bumper traffic that clogs up roadways two hours or 
so before a race begins, leave early for the race. I’m talking about leaving 
your hotel room at the crack of dawn if the race starts at noon. After you get 
to the track, you can sleep in your car if you need to. Or you can walk around 
the grounds to check out what the vendors are selling as souvenirs. You 
can also grab breakfast and head to your seat early to watch the pre-race 
activities. NASCAR hands out awards before each race and introduces each 
driver to the crowd. Be in your seat at least 45 minutes before the race begins 
if you don’t want to miss all the action.
 
Some people try to avoid race-day traffic jams by showing up at the track 
just a few minutes before the event begins. They figure that by then, most 
fans have already arrived and taken their seats. If you try this approach, 
you’re taking a chance, though. You could end up stuck in traffic if there’s an 
unexpected tie-up on the road.
Packing the Right Stuff for Race Day
If you haven’t been to a race before, here’s a handy list of what to bring with 
you and what to leave at home:
 
✓ Do bring binoculars to a race, no matter where you’re sitting. Even if you 
have the best seats in the house, it’s difficult to see the teams, cars, and 
drivers up close, especially at a big track.
First aid at the track
Every track has first-aid centers set up through-
out the grounds, as well as a medical care 
center in the infield. Experienced medical 
personnel are on hand to help you if you fall and 
scrape your leg, hurt your back, break 
your wrist, or even have a serious medical 
emergency such as a heart attack. If you’re too 
hurt to walk to a first-aid center, send a friend 
to get help or contact one of the ushers in the 
grandstands. All the track staff members are 
connected via two-way radios, so help will 
arrive shortly.
The same goes for fans in the infield. At many 
tracks with motor homes parked inside 
them, emergency workers rove through the 
grounds on four-wheelers. The infield care 
center also is available for fans who need 
medical assistance.

242
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
 
✓ Do bring a camera with a telephoto lens (which brings the action closer 
to you) if you want a good picture of the cars on the track.
 
✓ Do bring earplugs, especially for children. NASCAR races are loud, with 
decibel levels that can rival the roar of an airplane engine. The best 
kinds of noise deterrents are headsets that actually muffle the sound. If 
you’re the macho type who doesn’t want to wear earplugs, your ears 
may ring, and your head may hurt the next day.
 
✓ Do bring a raincoat. Umbrellas aren’t allowed in the grandstands 
because they get in the way of other fans’ views of the track.
 
✓ Do dress for the weather. It can be steamy and sweltering at races held 
in the summer but cold, damp, and windy at races in the spring or fall. 
Be prepared, and check the weather forecast before you leave for a race.
 
✓ Do wear sunscreen. You’re a perfect candidate for sunburn when you 
watch a race. You sit in aluminum grandstands for four hours in the 
middle of the day. Sunscreen can prevent an uncomfortable ride home.
 
✓ Do bring a seat cushion if you want a more comfortable perch in the 
stands.
 
✓ Do bring a radio or scanner (which I discuss in the “Riding Along with 
the Driver” section later in this chapter) if you want to keep track of 
what’s going on during a race. Wear headphones, though, so you can 
hear the conversations without the huge distraction of the engine noise.
 
✓ Do bring lots of liquids so you can stay hydrated on hot days. Just like 
drivers and crew members, fans need to drink plenty of liquids to keep 
themselves from dehydrating. You wouldn’t believe the number of fans 
who are taken to the hospital with heat stroke or exhaustion on a hot 
Sunday race day.
 
✓ Do pack food if you don’t want to spend money on concessions.
 
✓ Don’t bring any glass containers into the grandstands.
 
✓ Don’t bring any coolers that are bigger than 14x14x14 inches.
Fitting In with a NASCAR Crowd
If you’re sitting at your first NASCAR race with a bunch of veteran fans, what 
do you do to fit in? Well, if you don’t know much, the best plan is to keep 
quiet, watch the race, and learn. If you want to join in on the fun, though, you 
can cheer for your favorite driver and take part in some of the conversations 
around you.
One sure-fire way of sounding like a longtime NASCAR fan is to refer to teams 
by their car numbers. So, when talking about Dale Earnhardt, Jr.’s team, 
you can say, “The No. 88 car is really kicking it today.” Or, if someone asks 
which team you like, you can say, “Oh, I like the 48.” An educated fan would 

243
 Chapter 15: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track
immediately know that you’re a Jimmie Johnson supporter. If you really want 
to dazzle the fans around you, you can use a multi-numeric scheme such as, 
“Wow, did you see the 18 pass the 29 on the inside? I thought he was going to 
spin out the 99 or at least smack into the 11 when he did that.”
Dressing the part also helps you fit into the crowd at NASCAR races. That 
means you should at least have a T-shirt or hat with a driver’s or team’s logo 
on it. You rarely see fans at a NASCAR race with plain, button-down shirts 
and khakis on. If you wear an outfit like this, you’ll stick out like — like a 
preppie at a Metallica concert. NASCAR fans are loyal and love to support 
their drivers — and are proud to show it.
Here are a few more tips for how to behave at the track:
 
✓ Don’t throw anything onto the race track or in the grandstands. If you 
do, security guards will kick you out of the speedway with no refund.
 
✓ Don’t drink too much and do crazy things. If you do, you’ll be kicked out 
before you know it — which will most likely sober you up.
 
✓ Don’t curse and carry on. The people around you paid good money for 
their seats and don’t want to hear you ranting about how much you 
dislike a particular driver. Also, remember that kids are in the stands.
Going behind the Scenes, If You’re Lucky
While grandstand tickets and infield passes give fans a great view of NASCAR 
races, garage passes let you go into the pits and the garages before the race 
starts and get a behind-the-scenes look at the sport. Unfortunately, fans can’t 
buy garage passes at most tracks, particularly for NASCAR Sprint Cup races. 
Those passes are reserved for sponsors, friends, and family members of race 
teams, or people who are affiliated with the sport in some way. Call a track 
ahead of time, though, to see whether passes are for sale for other races, 
especially for NASCAR Nationwide Series races or NASCAR Camping World 
Truck Series races, which may be less restrictive than NASCAR Sprint Cup 
races. You may get lucky.
Following the rules
If you’re lucky enough to get a garage pass, you get a unique view of the 
drivers and the crews preparing for a NASCAR race. You can walk through 
the garage area and look at crews working on their cars. You can hang out 
around the team haulers (see Chapter 7 for a description) to get a glimpse of 
drivers as they walk to their cars. You can take all the photos you want to 
remember your day. But remember the following rules before heading into 
the garage:

244
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
 
✓ You need to stay on your toes in the NASCAR garage because you really 
are in the middle of the action. Practice time is precious for NASCAR 
teams, so the cars often zoom in and out of their garages to get as much 
track time as possible. The drivers are focused on making their cars just 
right, which means they aren’t necessarily watching out for people 
strolling through the garage like tourists at Walt Disney World.
 
 Because of driver lobbying, fewer (non-necessary) people are now 
allowed in the garage area. The drivers’ complaint: There used to be so 
many people watching the action that drivers and teams didn’t have 
enough room to do their work. To help solve the problem, NASCAR 
came up with “cold” and “hot” passes. While some tracks sell a minimal 
amount of cold passes (which can be used at times when engines are 
not turned on), hot passes are not for sale. Only a certain number of TV, 
print, and radio reporters are allowed in the garage area and along pit 
road when a red light designates a hot period, as are drivers’ families, 
some sponsor representatives, and, of course, team members.
 
✓ When in the garage, revert to the wise words of advice your mom gave 
you when the two of you took a trip to the china store when you were 
little: Look, but don’t touch. You are fortunate to get a peek at NASCAR 
teams at work, so don’t get uppity when someone tells you to stop 
touching a piece of equipment or stand back from a car. The drivers and 
crew members are at work and don’t want to be disturbed — and they 
don’t want their equipment to be disturbed either. So walk through the 
garage with respect.
 
✓ You must adhere to the following dress code if you want to step foot in 
the garage area — no ifs, ands, or buts about it:
 
• You have to wear long pants. No shorts, clam diggers, Bermuda 
shorts, or capris are allowed — your legs have to be completely 
covered.
 
• Your shirt must cover your shoulders. No tank tops, tube tops, or 
sleeveless shirts allowed.
 
• You can’t wear open-toed shoes such as sandals, flip-flops, or 
strappy stiletto high heels.
 
✓ Stay clear of the garage during the final hour of practice before the race. 
It’s dangerous to linger in the garage because cars are rushing in and out 
of the garage while teams make last-minute changes.
 
✓ Don’t bring any alcoholic beverages into the garage. They aren’t 
allowed.
 
✓ You must keep your garage pass visible at all times and a form of 
identification in your possession; otherwise, you will be asked to leave.

245
 Chapter 15: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track
Asking for autographs in the garage
 
Usually, you can find autograph cards outside each team hauler, where 
drivers and crews congregate when not working on their cars. An autograph 
card is a sheet of heavy-duty paper with a driver’s picture on the front and 
his vital statistics on the reverse side. It’s for — you guessed it — getting 
autographs. Some people take them for souvenirs, though, because they’re 
free. (It’s not good form to take more than one.)
If you want to use the autograph card to get an autograph, you can try to 
corner a driver in the garage area to get him to sign it. Doing so can be tricky 
business because drivers are so focused while they’re in the garage — 
they’re at work. But if you insist on getting autographs or getting your picture 
taken with a driver, use a little courtesy. Don’t approach drivers as they 
prepare for practice runs, prior to qualifying, or immediately before the race. 
You will likely fail, which builds up hard feelings between drivers and fans. 
Remember, the garage is their office, and they are much more concerned 
with how their car is performing than signing an autograph card. Another tip: 
When they do have a few minutes of free time, most drivers will sign cards 
or hats that fans hand them through the fence between the garage area and 
the infield.
 
If you really want an autograph or photo, here are some hints:
 
✓ Wait outside a team hauler to catch a driver. He isn’t around his car, so 
he isn’t going to be as distracted. But don’t dare go into the hauler. It’s 
off limits to fans because that’s where drivers and teams have meetings.
 
✓ Don’t bother drivers just before qualifying. They may be nervous about 
their fast lap and scowl in your photo.
 
✓ Pay attention to whether a driver is running well during practice. 
If he isn’t, he probably won’t be in the mood to sign autographs. If you 
do approach him for an autograph or photo, at least have something 
positive to say.
 
✓ Keep sponsor loyalty in mind. Think twice before asking Jeff Gordon 
(a Chevy driver) to sign a Ford hat or before asking Jimmie Johnson 
(who drives for Lowe’s) to sign a Home Depot T-shirt. Remember 
that loyalty runs deep in NASCAR. You don’t want to put a driver in an 
awkward position.
 
✓ Bring your own pen. A black felt-tipped marker, such as an indelible 
Sharpie, is best.
 
✓ Be prepared to walk with a driver as he signs your item. Most drivers 
know that if they stop, they’ll soon be mobbed. They use the walk-and-
sign technique, so be prepared to stride alongside them.

246
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
 
✓ Don’t expect to have a full-blown conversation with a driver. He’s on 
the job and trying to concentrate. If you want to chat with your favorite 
driver, go to a scheduled appearance he’s making in the area (see 
Chapter 8 for more on drivers making appearances). For example, Matt 
Kenseth may sit down and sign autographs at a local Dewalt Power 
Tools outlet. No doubt he’ll be more relaxed in that atmosphere than he 
is at the track.
 
✓ Even if you’ve been waiting all day in the sun, don’t chastise a driver 
if he walks out to his car without stopping to give you his autograph. 
Maybe he’s in a rush to get somewhere. Maybe his car isn’t running well. 
Maybe he doesn’t feel well. Maybe he has personal things on his mind. 
Remember: A garage pass doesn’t guarantee you autographs, but it does 
guarantee you a rare look at drivers and teams at work — a look that 
most people aren’t fortunate enough to get.
 
✓ Saying “thank you” always helps.
Riding Along with the Driver
Whether you’re watching a race from the grandstands or the infield, you can 
be even closer to the action if you bring a radio with a headset. The Motor 
Racing Network and the Performance Racing Network radio announcers offer 
analysis, race statistics, and play-by-play commentary of what’s going on 
during a race. They tell you what’s going on in turn two, when all you can see 
are the cars coming out of turn four. They also let you know what kinds of 
problems different cars are experiencing. You may see Jeff Gordon slow 
down on the track, but unless you’re tuned into the broadcast, you won’t 
know why. Local frequencies are listed inside the packages in which the 
radios are purchased and can also be found on the Internet.
 
A good number of fans have handheld radio frequency scanners — Walkman-
sized instruments that pick up preselected two-way radio channels in the 
immediate area. They allow you to listen in on conversations between drivers 
and their crews during practice, qualifying, and races. You also can hear 
NASCAR officials talk among themselves and with the teams. It’s sort of like a 
legal way to eavesdrop — and it’s fun.
 
You can also rent NASCAR Sprint FanView: a handheld scanner that shows 
TV video of the race, the running positions of all the drivers, lap times, and 
season standings. This way, you can hear communication between the 
driver and his team and see all the action around the track in case you have 
blocked views from your seat. The FanView also features three in-car cameras 
and DIRECTV HotPass, which follows four drivers throughout race day. You 
usually find a number of NASCAR Sprint FanView booths all around the track. 
The cost as of this writing is $50 per day or $70 for a weekend.

 Chapter 15: Heading Out for a Weekend at the Track
Another possibility is to rent a scanner with headphones that just has audio 
capabilities. You can rent these for between $25 and $50 a day.
If you attend NASCAR races often, you may want to invest in your own 
scanner. You can buy one at your local electronics store or from radio 
companies that have booths at the race track. The scanners cost from $100 
to $350, depending on their features. Look for a scanner that scans at least 
100 channels per second, and one that scans VHF and UHF high and low 
bands. Really, you don’t need a scanner much fancier than that when you’re 
at a NASCAR race — you just need the correct frequencies of the drivers, 
teams, officials, and radio broadcast to get your money’s worth. You can buy 
updated scanner lists outside the race track where souvenirs are sold.
Here are some companies you can call to buy scanners or get information on 
obtaining frequency lists:
 
✓ Race-Scan: 800-441-2841 or www.racescan.com
 
✓ Racing Electronics: 800-272-7111 or www.racingelectronics.com
 
✓ Racing Radios: 800-669-1522 or www.racingradios.com
 
If you buy or rent a scanner, be sure to get a frequency list at the track, which 
has a bunch of numbers on it, each coinciding with a team, a NASCAR official, 
or a radio broadcast. Usually each frequency consists of three numbers, 
followed by a decimal point and then more numbers — such as 484.340. If 
you’re programming your scanner on your own, you have to input all those 
numbers into the scanner and assign them another number. For example, you 
can program my frequency under the number 5 on your scanner because I 
drive the No. 5 Chevy. So, when you tune to Channel 5 on your scanner, my 
frequency pops up, and you can listen to me chat with my crew. Some teams 
keep the same radio channel for years and years, but others change their 
frequencies from time to time, so you want to get the latest frequency lists to 
stay on top of all the action.
After you get your scanner and input the frequencies, you’re ready to listen 
in. There are a few different techniques to listening to a race on a scanner. 
You can listen to the radio broadcast, then tune in to teams’ frequencies 
from time to time. Or you can put your scanner on scan mode, so it stops at 
a frequency only when there is communication going on. Or you can listen 
to one team only, keeping your scanner tuned to the same frequency all day. 
Whatever way you choose to use your scanner, it’s bound to make things 
more interesting for you. You can hear a crew chief tell a driver when to 
make a pit stop. You can hear a driver complain about his car. You even can 
hear a driver’s reaction just after he gets into an accident.
 
When using a scanner, keep in mind that conversations between a team and a 
driver may not be appropriate for children.

Leaving with Souvenirs
It’s hard to miss all the souvenir trailers lined up at the track. The trailers are 
colorful and are always in a conspicuous area, such as just outside the main 
entrance. If you have time before or after a race, you can mill around the 
souvenir area and pick up a bumper sticker, T-shirt, or cap. (For more on 
souvenirs, turn to Chapter 2.) But if you really want a unique souvenir, you 
have to look a bit harder.
Sometimes you’ll stumble upon someone selling racing tires that were used 
in an actual NASCAR race. They go for anywhere from $10 to $60. Why would 
you want a racing tire? Well, it certainly would be a conversation piece sitting 
smack in the middle of your living room. Many fans lay a tire on its side and 
put a sheet of glass on top of it, which makes for a good coffee table or end 
table. Some fans put them in their yards, fill them with dirt, and plant flowers 
in them. Whatever their use, they are unusual souvenirs from a race.
Fans with infield passes or garage passes always comb the infield for trinkets 
after an event is over: pieces of mangled sheet metal from a car that wrecked, 
or even lug nuts that flew off of a car during a pit stop. If you plan to do this, 
make sure the item you take is something that a team is leaving behind — 
otherwise, you can be arrested for stealing. Ask a team whether you can 
take it before you go walking off with an entire hood or a used tire. Otherwise, 
you may be embarrassed when a security guard grabs you and makes you 
take the piece of equipment back to its owner. Sometimes, though, teams 
leave their used tires behind (without wheels) — near their pit stall or in 
the garage. Those are free for your taking because they’re not going to use 
them again.

M
ost NASCAR fans are lucky to attend one or two races a year. The rest 
of the time, they rely on TV, radio, newspapers, and Web sites to keep 
up on what’s going on. Luckily, plenty of media outlets cover NASCAR races, 
NASCAR drivers, and the goings-on in the sport. In fact, NASCAR’s growth has 
attracted much attention in the news, so it’s difficult to get away from it even 
if you wanted to.
You can also join fan clubs or log on to a team’s Web site to catch up on the 
latest news about drivers. In this chapter, I give you all the details you need 
to immerse yourself in the sport — even if you can’t make it to many races.
Grab That Remote: Watching 
Races on Television
When you can’t go to races, watching them on television is a great alterna-
tive. You may miss the roar of the engines and the smell of rubber on 
the track, but in general you actually get to see more than the fans at the 
track. This section describes the advantages of watching from home (or your 
favorite bar), as well as where to find NASCAR TV coverage.

250
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
Catching all the angles
During every race, TV cameras mounted around the track catch the action 
at every point on the speedway. The cameras usually cover the following 
angles:
 
✓ Cars racing down the frontstretch, backstretch, and through all 
the turns.
 
✓ Cars zooming by the grandstands: Sometimes you see just a blur of 
color; other times you can recognize which car is which. It’s all captured 
by cameras placed near the outer edge of the track.
 
✓ Fans cheering in the grandstands up close: You also get a view of the 
fans in the grandstands taken by cameras in a blimp or helicopter above 
the speedway.
 
✓ Ground shots of groups of cars coming through the turns: Those 
cameras are positioned at ground level in the infield.
 
✓ Interior shots from cars: Several cars have in-car cameras set up during 
each race. This feature gives viewers at home a close look at drivers 
while they’re in their race cars, including what a driver sees when he 
swerves to miss an accident or when he gets into an accident himself. It 
shows you how bad a crash can be for a driver, too. You see the whole 
car shake and hear the loud thud of the impact. You know a driver is 
involved in a bad accident when the in-car camera goes out and all you 
see is static.
 
✓ Views of what’s behind and in front of cars: Small cameras mounted to 
the front and back bumpers of several cars are especially helpful when 
there’s an accident on the track because they give you an up-close view 
of how the wreck started or who started it.
 
✓ The pit road action: You see pit crew members crouched on the pit 
wall, waiting for their car to come down pit road. You also see, from all 
different angles, the pit crew servicing the car. Most broadcasts now 
include a camera attached to one of the team members’ helmets. You 
get a “point-of-view” look at how a crew member quickly does his job 
during the mayhem of a pit stop.
TV cameras don’t capture only the action on the track — they bring you all 
the action off the track, too. When drivers take their cars into the garage 
during a race — after blowing an engine or having a wreck — the TV cameras 
follow. That’s when you, as a home viewer, can see more than the people 
in the grandstands do. You see the driver get out of his car, sometimes 
red-faced after falling out of a race, and you hear his explanation of why he’s 
in the garage and not on the track. You also get to see the car, banged up 
and all.

251
 Chapter 16: Tracking NASCAR Events from the Comfort of Home
Getting a running commentary
During every televised race, commentators describe what’s happening on the 
track, which is especially helpful if you’re a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series novice. 
Commentators sit above the track in a booth where they can usually see the 
entire speedway. Monitors keep them updated on the action and who is run-
ning where. The commentators give you all the information you could want, 
including who is where on each lap, how far behind the leader they are, team 
statistics, driver status, and crew chief interviews. If a car stalls on the track, 
they tell you why. If a tire rolls off a car and down pit road, they tell you how 
it happened. The commentators don’t do all the work, though — reporters 
are running from pit to pit asking crew chiefs and team members for informa-
tion. If a tire on a car goes flat, for example, the pit reporter reports live from 
that driver’s pit, shows the flat tire, and describes what has happened.
NASCAR races are covered differently than football or basketball games 
because commentators can talk to the pit crews while the event is going on. 
Sometimes the commentators even have negotiated with a driver to talk 
to him via a radio during caution laps. You don’t see sideline reporters in 
football interviewing the coach in the middle of the fourth quarter. And you 
certainly don’t hear reporters chatting with the quarterback between plays.
Finding TV racing broadcasts
You can find NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races on ESPN, ABC, FOX, TNT, and 
DIRECTV HotPass. The NASCAR Nationwide Series is broadcast on ESPN2 
and ABC. The NASCAR Camping World Truck Series and other NASCAR 
news and talk shows and events such as qualifying are shown on SPEED. 
(Check your local TV listings to track down a specific event.) Some of 
NASCAR’s developmental series races can be seen on HDNet, TSN (Canada), 
and Televisa (Mexico). The networks have different commentators and pit 
reporters, but the overall coverage is informative and interesting.
All races are scheduled for live broadcast. Most NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
races are on Sunday afternoon, but a handful are run on Saturday afternoon 
or Saturday night. It’s not like the old days, in the early 1960s, when you 
could count on one hand the number of stock car races telecast in a year, 
and those races were broadcast on ABC’s Wide World of Sports a week or 
more after the event!
The FOX, TNT, and ESPN/ABC networks took over NASCAR broadcasts from 
several other networks starting in 2007. FOX broadcasts the first half of the 
season, TNT broadcasts a portion of the races in the middle of the season, 
and ESPN and ABC broadcast the remaining races, including the Chase for 
the NASCAR Sprint Cup.

252
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
In addition to the national network television NASCAR broadcasts, satellite 
television company DIRECTV also broadcasts races in what is known as 
NASCAR HotPass. You have to subscribe to this package. Subscribers get 
four fully-produced channels that follow four different drivers throughout 
the race.
Taking in the daily and weekly shows
If you can’t get enough NASCAR on weekends, plenty of networks have daily 
and weekly NASCAR shows so you can inundate yourself with information. 
These shows give you breaking news, driver interviews, race reviews, 
technical information, and almost everything you’d ever want to know in a 
30- to 60-minute segment.
Here are some of the TV shows that feature NASCAR:
 
✓ NASCAR Now on ESPN2: NASCAR Now is a daily show shown Monday 
through Friday evenings. The show features highlights from previous 
races, the week’s top storylines, breaking news from a number of ESPN 
reporters, and driver and crew chief interviews.
 
✓ NASCAR TV on SPEED Channel: The SPEED Channel offers a complete 
slate of pre- and post-race shows, midweek specials, and nightly 
programming. SPEED’s NASCAR block also includes Trackside, NASCAR 
Victory Lane, NASCAR Performance, and This Week in NASCAR, along with 
shows that feature the history of the sport and day-to-day happenings 
on the track. SPEED also airs event qualifying and some event practice 
sessions.
 
✓ Around the Track on Fox Sports Net: A commentator and group of 
drivers talk about NASCAR racing every week, delving into the previous 
race and news from the circuit.
Tuning In to Radio Broadcasts
Radio provides great play-by-play descriptions of races. In fact, they’re so 
good that some people watch races on TV but turn down the sound so 
that they can listen to the radio broadcast instead. Radio reporters are 
everywhere on race day: above the track, in the pits, talking to crew chiefs 
and crew members during the race, in the garage, and interviewing drivers 
that have fallen out of the race. They give play-by-play commentary without 
missing a beat. Radio reporters also work after the race, doing driver 
interviews after television gets done with them.

253
 Chapter 16: Tracking NASCAR Events from the Comfort of Home
When you’re listening to a race broadcast, you may have several network 
options. To find out which radio station in your area carries the race, look up 
one of the following networks for a list of its affiliate stations:
 
✓ Motor Racing Network (MRN), a division of International Speedway 
Corporation (ISC), is based in Daytona Beach. In addition to NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series races, MRN also carries the majority of NASCAR 
Nationwide Series and all NASCAR Camping World Truck Series races. 
MRN, which has hundreds of affiliates in 48 states and Canada, reaches 
150 countries worldwide and many ships at sea on Armed Forces Radio. 
In addition, MRN carries the NASCAR-related programs “NASCAR Today” 
and “NASCAR Live.” For a complete schedule, go to www.racingone.
com/mrn_home.aspx.
 
✓ Performance Racing Network (PRN) is based in Concord, North 
Carolina. It’s owned by Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (SMI), the 
company that also owns Lowe’s Motor Speedway and other tracks 
hosting NASCAR races. PRN broadcasts approximately a third of 
the season’s races, including the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe’s Motor 
Speedway, both races at Bristol Motor Speedway, and both Atlanta 
Motor Speedway races. For information, go to www.goprn.com.
 
✓ The Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) Radio Network broadcasts 
all races from Indianapolis Motor Speedway, including the Allstate 400 
at the Brickyard.
 
✓ Sirius XM Satellite Radio has a 24-hour radio channel dedicated solely 
to NASCAR. It carries live coverage of NASCAR’s three national series 
through MRN, PRN, and IMS. The NASCAR Channel on Sirius XM Radio 
also provides in-depth news coverage, interviews, talk shows, and other 
original programming.
Following NASCAR in Print
Many newspapers and magazines cover NASCAR racing, but the depth of the 
coverage varies. Most newspapers run stories on races and who won them. 
Some run features throughout the week leading up to a race and report on 
breaking news. Some magazines run a NASCAR story only once every couple 
of weeks, while other magazines are entirely devoted to the sport.
If you want to purchase a newspaper or magazine that covers NASCAR 
regularly, here are some you can choose from:
 
✓ NASCAR Illustrated is a monthly magazine with features, commentary, 
and profiles of people in NASCAR racing.

254
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
 
✓ NASCAR Scene is a weekly newspaper published in tabloid form that 
covers the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, the NASCAR Nationwide Series, 
and the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. It offers feature stories, 
race statistics, and the NASCAR lowdown.
 
✓ NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Yearbook is an annual publication. This 
magazine hits shelves just in time for Christmas and features a rundown 
on the previous season. It highlights drivers, races, and the NASCAR 
Sprint Cup Series champion.
 
✓ The Official NASCAR Preview and Press Guide is a magazine that 
comes out once a year, profiling drivers and providing statistics of 
drivers in every NASCAR division. It also has a section devoted to 
NASCAR’s tracks.
 
✓ Pole Position comes out 36 times a year — once for every NASCAR 
Sprint Cup race — and is available only in the upcoming race’s market. 
This magazine includes driver profiles, upcoming race analysis, and 
news features.
 
✓ Speedway Illustrated hits newsstands once a month and includes info 
about the upcoming month, features, stories on the technical elements 
of NASCAR, and highlights of many of NASCAR’s touring series.
 
✓ Sporting News NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Preview is an annual 
magazine published at the beginning of the year. This publication 
highlights drivers as well as races for the upcoming season.
Becoming a Statistical 
Genius: Loop Data
In 2005, NASCAR introduced a groundbreaking new initiative: Loop Data sta-
tistics. Previously, fans could look up stats about their favorite drivers such 
as laps led and top-five finishes. But Loop Data allows fans to talk about the 
sport in new ways. Loop Data stats include Driver Rating (which is a lot like 
the NFL’s quarterback rating), Average Running Position, Green Flag Speed, 
Fastest Laps Run, Laps in the Top 15, Green Flag Passes, and much more.
Here’s how it works: There are numerous scoring loops imbedded under-
neath each track on the NASCAR circuit. Every time a car whips by, a time 
and position are registered, and a statistic is born. NASCAR had already 
been collecting the loop data to score races. But in 2005, it began using the 
scoring loops for statistical purposes.
You can check out Loop Data statistics on www.NASCAR.com. Just look for 
the word “Statistics” on the home page.

 Chapter 16: Tracking NASCAR Events from the Comfort of Home
Staying in Touch with Your 
Favorite Driver
You can also keep tabs on your favorite drivers through their personal 
Web sites, fan blogs, and fan clubs. You can find everything from a driver’s 
schedule to his statistics to where to purchase souvenirs. Many drivers also 
will autograph pictures or hats sent to them at their race shop. It’s all part 
of how fans stay close to NASCAR drivers and how NASCAR drivers stay 
linked to their fans, even though drivers travel to different race tracks — 
and sometimes different parts of the country — every weekend.
Surfing to your favorite driver Web sites
It’s easy to keep up with your favorite driver if you have access to the 
Internet. Most drivers have their own Web sites that are chock full of infor-
mation, so if you hop onto a search engine and type in the driver’s name, 
you can easily find the driver’s Web site if he has one. The sites have 
biographical information, statistics, photographs, race schedules, and 
personal appearance schedules (meaning you can find out where a driver 
will sign autographs and be there to meet him).
Joining a driver fan club
If you can’t get enough of your favorite driver just by watching him race, you 
may want to join his fan club. Fan clubs are groups of people who ardently 
support a driver and want to show that support by banding together. 
Membership fees range from $8 to $45, depending on the driver and the 
perks you get for being in the club. Most clubs provide you with an ID card, a 
signed postcard, and a discount card to buy your driver’s souvenirs at the 
race track. Some even send you a personalized card, signed by the driver, on 
your birthday and during the holidays. Many clubs have meetings where fans 
can get together and discuss their driver or just talk shop.
 
If you’re doing an Internet search for a driver fan club, remember that many of 
the sites are unofficial. While those sites are fine to look up, keep in mind 
that a driver’s official site is the only one that will guarantee that the posted 
information is correct. When you go to the Web site, it will say “official” 
somewhere on it, meaning it’s the real one set up by a driver or his company. 
Your best option is to contact a driver’s shop for information on his fan 
clubs and Internet sites.

256
Par t IV: Keeping Up with NASCAR Events 
Writing to the race shops
If you’d like to get a souvenir autographed by a driver or a crew member, 
send it to his race shop with return postage. Usually, the race shop has a 
room just for souvenirs, where a driver goes to sign all types of T-shirts, die-
cast cars, posters, and other trinkets. It may take them a while to send your 
souvenir back to you — maybe six months to a year if it’s Jeff Gordon or Dale 
Earnhardt, Jr. — so don’t get impatient. They’re signing as fast as they can!
Here are addresses for some of the bigger race shops. Just address your

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his part features my unsolicited opinion on a few 
important subjects. You find out who I think are 
NASCAR’s greatest drivers and which NASCAR races I 
think are the best — from a fan’s standpoint, of course. 
(This is why I list restrictor plate races, which most 
drivers dread.) I also describe ten of the closest finishes 
in NASCAR history so you get a sense of just how exciting 
the race for the checkered flag can be.

Chapter 17
The Greatest NASCAR 
Drivers of All Time
In This Chapter
▶ Reviewing my pick of NASCAR’s legendary drivers
▶ Looking at the stellar statistics of great drivers
M
any drivers win races, but only a few — those with special talent, 
charisma, and personalities you just can’t forget — become legends. 
These drivers have left an indelible mark on the sport of stock-car racing, 
and while they may not be the drivers you cheer for, they are the ones who 
garner your respect.
The list of greatest NASCAR drivers of all time can be argued until the end 
of the next millennium, but here are the ones — in alphabetical order — 
that I think are the best. Some have won championships. Some have won a 
lot of races. Some have shown unparalleled determination. I’ve raced against 
a lot of them, so I’ve gotten to know their driving styles and personalities 
firsthand. Because of that, I’m convinced that they’re some of the best 
drivers ever.
Note: To keep things simple, I refer to NASCAR’s premier series as the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series throughout this chapter, even though it has been 
known by many different titles since its inaugural year of 1949. That’s why 
some of the drivers are referred to as racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series even though Sprint did not sponsor the series during their careers.
Bobby Allison
In his 25 years of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing, Bobby Allison was 
fearless. And, from time to time, he was reckless. But that in-your-face driving 
style and unmistakable talent were the reasons he was one of the most 
successful drivers in NASCAR history. He won the 1983 NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series championship and 84 races in his career, tying him with Darrell 
Waltrip for third on the all-time wins list.

262
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The most memorable moment of his career came when he won the 1988 
Daytona 500 — his third Daytona 500 victory — and his son, the late Davey 
Allison, finished second. The two celebrated together in Victory Lane, with 
son proud of dad, and dad proud of son. Bobby retired in 1988 but still 
attends many races.
Dale Earnhardt
Ask any NASCAR driver, and he’ll tell you that Dale Earnhardt was the one 
person he didn’t want to see in his rearview mirror, especially during 
the final laps of a race. There’s a reason he was called “The Intimidator,” 
and it’s not just that he didn’t always exude warmth. Earnhardt was the 
quintessential bully on the race track, driving rough enough and fast enough 
to win 76 NASCAR Sprint Cup races from 1975 through the 2001 season. 
(He died following an accident in the season-opening Daytona 500 that year.) 
That ranks the driver from rural North Carolina seventh on the all-time 
victories list.
But the number of championships Earnhardt won overshadows his race 
victories: He won seven titles, tying him with Richard Petty for the most 
NASCAR Sprint Cup championships in history. While Earnhardt won on 
nearly every NASCAR track, his forte was on superspeedways where, as 
legend has it, he could “see” air coming off the cars around him and thus 
navigate through it better than anyone. (See Chapter 10 for more on this 
phenomenon.) No matter on what type of track he raced, Earnhardt’s sixth 
sense allowed him to make smart moves that helped him thread through the 
field and stay up front once he got there.
Jeff Gordon
When Jeff Gordon came into NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing in 1992, 
everybody thought he was going to make it big and become the next greatest 
NASCAR driver of the century. Everybody was right.
In 1995, Gordon clinched the first of his four NASCAR Sprint Cup Series cham-
pionships, winning it when he was just 24 to become the youngest champion 
in NASCAR’s modern era, dating from 1972. After his immediate success, 
Gordon was quickly dubbed “Wonder Boy” and booed at nearly every track 
in the series. Why? Perhaps because he won too much, too early. Perhaps 
because he grew up in California and then moved to Indiana to race, so he 
didn’t fit the mold like fan favorites such as Dale Earnhardt and Bill Elliott. 
Perhaps because he seemed too goody-goody. Perhaps because he becomes 
more and more unstoppable as the years go by.

263
 Chapter 17: The Greatest NASCAR Drivers of All Time
Gordon won back-to-back NASCAR Sprint Cup Series titles in 1997 and 1998, 
and in 1998 he won 13 races to tie Richard Petty’s modern-era record for 
victories in a single season. In 2001, Jeff once again won the championship, 
leading to the nickname “Four-Time” as in four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series champion. He ranks third behind Petty and Earnhardt in titles won. 
The scary part is, he’s not retiring any time soon and has many more years 
to win races, break records, and clinch championships. That’s good for his 
fans — bad for his competition. As of 2008, Gordon had won 81 races, putting 
him sixth on the all-time wins list.
For all his success, Gordon remains the target of boo-birds in the stands, 
which he says he has learned to largely ignore. The one exception? Gordon is 
a fan favorite in the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard, run at Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway, where he is considered a hometown race car driver.
Dale Jarrett
The son of two-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Ned Jarrett, it 
didn’t take Dale long to step out from behind his father’s shadow and 
begin making a name for himself. Signing on with (then) new team owner Joe 
Gibbs in 1993, he and his team started the season with a bang, winning the 
Daytona 500. Three years later, he captured his second Daytona 500 crown 
with team owner Robert Yates, a feat they pulled off for the third time in 
2000. Highly thought of by both his race team and fans, Jarrett was a popular 
series champion, winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup title in 1999.
A gentleman on and off the track, Jarrett and his wife, Kelley, are heavily 
involved in the sports endeavors of his four children. He is also sought after 
as a golf partner in tournaments sponsored by sponsors and tracks, as he is 
as talented on the links as he is behind the wheel of a race car. Jarrett retired 
from the sport in 2008 and became a fan favorite in another arena: broadcast-
ing. He now works for ESPN as an analyst during NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
Alan Kulwicki
Even though Alan Kulwicki won only five NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races 
in his career, he was good enough to win the 1992 NASCAR Sprint Cup 
championship. And he made an impact on the sport that no statistics can 
measure. He was one of the first competitors to treat the sport as a science. 
Kulwicki grew up in Wisconsin, driving in the American Speed Association 
in the midwestern United States before moving south to try his hand at 
NASCAR racing. But Kulwicki was different than most drivers. He had a 

264
Part V: The Part of Tens 
college degree in engineering and used the physics and math that he learned 
to set up his race car. At first, people laughed when he showed up at races 
with a briefcase filled with calculators — but now briefcases have become 
part of the mandatory gear for crew chiefs and those who work on a car’s 
setup. Kulwicki was also determined to field his own car and make it to the 
top the hard way, without sponsorship. He did just that, clinching the 1992 
championship after winning only two races. Kulwicki wasn’t able to defend 
his title, however, because he died in a plane crash in 1993.
David Pearson
No one wanted to mess with David Pearson when he was driving on the 
circuit. He was just the kind of quiet, cool, confident guy you didn’t want to 
make angry. People called him the “Silver Fox” because of his sly, cunning 
style. Perhaps that’s why Pearson, who is retired from the sport, won 
105 races in his NASCAR Sprint Cup Series career. He ranks second on the 
all-time wins list.
Pearson was a versatile driver who did well on superspeedways, intermedi-
ate tracks, short tracks, and road courses. He won nearly everywhere, so 
much so that Richard Petty still insists Pearson is the best driver in NASCAR 
history. Pearson won three NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championships — in 
1966, 1968, and 1969 — and continued to drive until 1986, when he retired. 
Even during his final years as a race car driver, he was a daunting sight on 
the track for his opponents. Not that he tried to be — that’s just the way he 
was. He made racing and winning look easy.
Richard Petty
Richard Petty isn’t called stock-car racing’s king for nothing. He won a record 
200 races in his 35-year career, nearly twice as many as anyone else. He also 
won a record seven NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championships, tying him 
with Dale Earnhardt for the series lead. He won a record seven Daytona 500s 
and a shocking 27 of 49 races in 1967, including ten in a row. Petty retired 
from driving in 1992 and is now a NASCAR car owner.
Petty wasn’t just a successful driver. He was adored by the public and 
became the sport’s unofficial public relations director, signing autographs 
and posing for pictures for hours, selling stock-car racing — which started 
out as a Southern sport — to mainstream America. When he won the 200th 
race of his career, President Ronald Reagan just happened to be at the track 

265
 Chapter 17: The Greatest NASCAR Drivers of All Time
to congratulate him; their meeting made all the papers. With his trademark 
cowboy hat, dark sunglasses, wide smile, and winning ways, it’s no wonder 
Petty became a fan favorite and sports icon. He’s part of racing’s most 
famous family — which began with his father, Lee Petty, who won three 
championships and the inaugural Daytona 500, and has continued with his 
son, Kyle. It will be nearly impossible for anyone to top what Petty did in the 
sport, what he did for the sport, and what he continues to do.
In an effort to give fans a first-hand experience with the excitement that 
comes from driving a race car, he opened the Richard Petty Driving 
Experience, a race school. (For more information on driving schools, see 
Chapter 4.)
Rusty Wallace
In an age when most drivers just hop into their cars and head for the race 
track, Rusty Wallace is old-school. He still gets under the car to check things 
out himself. He tells his crew chief exactly what to do with the car, going far 
beyond just saying “it’s loose” or “it’s tight.” This hands-on involvement is 
what’s made him so good over the years. Wallace learned the ins and outs of 
a race car growing up racing on short tracks in the Midwest, where he built 
his own cars, raced his own cars, and repaired his own cars.
When he began his NASCAR Sprint Cup Series career in 1980, he took that 
knowledge of cars with him — and translated it into stardom right away. 
In his first race in the series that year in Atlanta, the bushy-haired redhead 
finished second to Dale Earnhardt and immediately earned the respect of his 
competitors. Soon Wallace became one of the most successful and popular 
drivers in NASCAR history. In addition to the 1989 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
championship, he won 55 races in his 25-year career. Wallace retired in 2005 
and was immediately hired by ESPN as an analyst for its NASCAR Sprint Cup 
and NASCAR Nationwide Series race broadcasts.
Darrell Waltrip
Darrell Waltrip energized NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racing from the moment 
he started in 1972. Back then, Waltrip was a fast talker with a quick wit and 
not a pinch of humility. His personality grew even more outrageous every 
time he won a race. In fact, he earned the nickname “Jaws” for talking so 
much and boasting about his accomplishments. Fans either loved or loathed 
him because of his brashness. The thing is, Waltrip wasn’t totally out of line 

266
Part V: The Part of Tens 
when he bragged about himself — because he backed up his words with 
success on the track. He won 84 races in his NASCAR Sprint Cup career, 
which ties him for third all-time. He also won three series championships.
Waltrip has mellowed over the years, but he still loves to gab and trash-talk, 
good qualities for a driver-turned-television commentator. Behind the 
microphone since retiring from driving in 2000, Waltrip has become as 
successful and entertaining a commentator as he was a driver.
Cale Yarborough
A three-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion (he won three consecutive 
championships from 1976 to 1978), Cale Yarborough never thought twice 
about pushing himself or his cars to the limit, especially when he was teamed 
with legendary car owner Junior Johnson — who didn’t have any limits him-
self. Yarborough, who retired as a driver in 1988, was a spitfire even before 
getting into a race car, claiming to have wrestled snakes and alligators — and 
even insisting he got hit by lightning when he was young. Yarborough won 83 
races to put himself fifth on NASCAR’s all-time wins list. That includes four 
Daytona 500s, which he won in 1968, 1977, 1983, and 1984.

Ten Can’t-Miss Races of the Year
In This Chapter
▶ Listing the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races that you can’t miss
▶ Finding out why certain races are so special
E
ven though you may want to see every NASCAR race, it’s okay to admit 
you don’t have the time or the means to watch 36 NASCAR Sprint Cup 
Series races each year. If you can’t catch them all, this chapter lists some 
of the most exciting or historically important races that every self-respecting 
NASCAR fan should see at least once. I tried to keep the list to 10 (like the 
chapter title states), but I couldn’t do it — I had to bump it up to 11.
Fans and drivers have their own favorite races, but these are some of 
the ones on everybody’s list. Check out Chapter 14 for a description of 
each track.
Daytona 500
The Daytona 500, held in February at the Daytona International Speedway, is 
NASCAR’s Super Bowl — the most revered and most heralded race of the 
year. Some of the most famous drivers have won it, including Richard Petty 
(seven times!), Bobby Allison, Cale Yarborough, and even IndyCar Series 
legends Mario Andretti and A.J. Foyt. Unlike the Super Bowl, though, the 
Daytona 500 is the season opener, which is what makes it so special. Teams 
spend almost the entire off-season preparing for this one race and come to 
Daytona in February hoping to win that year’s championship. If you have a 
good finish in the Daytona 500, it sets the tone for your entire season, so 
emotions — and speeds — run high throughout the afternoon.
Coca-Cola 600
The Coca-Cola 600, formerly known as the World 600, is held the Sunday 
before Memorial Day at Lowe’s Motor Speedway north of Charlotte, North 

268
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Carolina, and is NASCAR’s longest event. With 600 miles of racing, it’s 
NASCAR’s version of a marathon, so fans have to be tenacious to watch the 
entire race. The race starts in late afternoon and isn’t finished until well after 
dark, so drivers and teams have to face constantly changing track conditions. 
The extra 100 miles also puts extraordinary strain on the engines. Drivers, 
crews, and cars are tested in this endurance race where only the competitors 
with the most stamina and the cars with the sturdiest parts finish up front.
The Daytona Night Race
Races at restrictor-plate tracks are naturally fun to watch because the cars 
run so fast and so close together. What makes them even more fun is when a 
race is held at night under the lights at Daytona International Speedway. The 
Daytona night race is held the Saturday of the Fourth of July weekend. It was 
moved from daytime to night in 1998 after track officials spent $5 million to 
install lights around the 2.5-mile superspeedway. Not only is the race cooler 
to watch because it’s no longer held in the sweltering midday heat of Central 
Florida in July — but it’s also one of the year’s most heart-pounding and 
spectacular events. To top that, the post-race fireworks show is awesome.
Allstate 400 at the Brickyard
Indy car purists said hell would freeze over before stock cars raced at 
Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the legendary home of the Indianapolis 500. 
Well, it froze over. The Allstate 400 at the Brickyard, held at the end of July, is 
one of the year’s most interesting NASCAR races. With a hefty paycheck at 
stake for the winner, drivers take chances to get to the front.
NASCAR only goes to the 2.5-mile Brickyard once a year, which makes the 
event all that more special. Every time a stock-car driver goes to Victory Lane 
at the storied track, he makes history — and the post-race celebration is one 
of the most unique in all of sports. The winning driver and team all line up 
along the “Yard of Bricks” on the frontstretch, get on their knees and kiss the 
bricks. Stock cars made their debut there in 1994, when Jeff Gordon won the 
inaugural event. Since then, the NASCAR race at Indy has been one of the 
best tickets in racing.
The Bristol Night Race
If you want to guarantee yourself a good time, watch the night race at Bristol 
Motor Speedway, held every August. What could be better than 43 cars cir-
cling a tiny, high-banked, half-mile track and bumping into each other the 

269
 Chapter 18: Ten Can’t-Miss Races of the Year
whole way? See all that at night — when sparks fly and tempers flare at the 
track tucked into the mountains of eastern Tennessee. Actually, both races at 
Bristol (the other is held during the day in April) are must-sees, but the night 
race is absolutely electric and action-packed.
The Talladega Fall Race
NASCAR has two restrictor-plate superspeedways where cars run in packs 
only inches apart — the 2.66-mile Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama and 
the 2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway in Florida. Of those two, 
Talladega is bigger and faster. Both the spring and fall races at Talladega are 
sensational to watch. By the fall race, which is during the Chase for the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup, the race for the championship is hot — and the title 
Chase may close up at the super-big, super-daunting track. As a fan, you can’t 
see the entire race track no matter where you sit in the grandstands, but 
seeing the swarm of cars coming off one of the turns is jaw-dropping. They 
race two-, three-, four-, and even five-wide at times.
Race No. 26 at Richmond
Races at Richmond International Raceway have long been fan favorites fea-
turing drivers racing side by side, door handle to door handle, all the way 
around the track, lap after lap. That may be one of the reasons that some fans 
call Richmond “the perfect track.” But the second race at Richmond, race No. 
26 on the schedule, is now a must-see race because it’s the last chance for 
drivers to make the final cut for the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup. Follow-
ing that race, only drivers in the top 12 in the points standings remain (with 
10 races to go) as championship contenders.
The NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race
Even though the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race doesn’t count toward the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship, it still should be one of the races 
you see — even if it’s just for the novelty. It’s held a week before the Coca-
Cola 600 at Lowe’s Motor Speedway in May, but it’s not at all like a normal 
NASCAR race. In fact, few of the real rules count. The race is primarily for 
winners from the previous and current NASCAR Sprint Cup seasons. It also 
invites any past NASCAR Sprint Cup champions who haven’t qualified via a 
race victory, plus the winner of the NASCAR Sprint Showdown, a preliminary 
event for teams that have not qualified for the showcase event. Since there 
are no points, drivers go all out for the win — and for the winner’s purse of 
approximately $1 million.

270
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Southern 500
Darlington Raceway is NASCAR’s first superspeedway — it opened in 1950 — 
and the Southern 500 is one of NASCAR’s most prized races. But winning 
the classic and becoming a part of Darlington history isn’t an easy task. 
Darlington is arguably the most unique and challenging track in NASCAR 
racing. Its walls seem to jump out and attack cars as the vehicles zoom 
through the corners. So you can see why only the bravest, most skillful 
drivers make it to Victory Lane at the South Carolina track.
Cale Yarborough and Jeff Gordon have the record for most Southern 500 
wins with five — but Bobby Allison isn’t far behind with four. That alone puts 
these drivers a notch above other drivers in the history book. Watching 
drivers as talented as those navigating this tricky track is worth the price of 
admission.
Championship Weekend 
at Homestead–Miami
What makes the event at Homestead–Miami Speedway a don’t-miss race is 
that it’s the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season finale. If you have the whole 
weekend open, it’s also the finale for the NASCAR Nationwide Series and the 
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. All three are must-watches. If it’s a 
close race for the championship, the race may be a nail-biter for drivers and 
teams that are in the running for the title — as well as for their fans. At least 
the Florida sunshine helps. With the new Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup, 
fans have a better chance than ever to see the actual crowning of the series 
champion. So far, since the Chase’s inception in 2004, every championship 
has been decided at the 1.5-mile Homestead track.
Infineon Raceway
Having made hard left turns the first half of the season, the majority of 
NASCAR’s drivers look forward to the season’s first road-course test, which 
comes in June at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California. Half of the 11 turns 
spread over the winding 1.95-mile course just outside San Francisco are to 
the right — a direction drivers generally avoid on ovals as it usually means a 
trip into the wall. While some drivers struggle on road courses (Infineon 
Raceway and Watkins Glen in northern New York are the series’ only two 
tracks with twists and turns), others enjoy non-oval racing, including five-
time event champion Jeff Gordon. Other drivers with victories at Infineon 
Raceway include two-time winner Tony Stewart, Kyle Busch, and Juan Pablo 
Montoya. For fans interested in making a road trip, the race near wine 
country is the place to be.

▶ Taking a look at the most exciting finishes in NASCAR history
▶ Recapping the closest margins of victory ever
T
here is one rule when it comes to following NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
races: Never leave early. Unlike other sports where blowouts occur and 
the ending can be predicted before the final whistle, with NASCAR anything 
can happen. Even if a driver has led every single lap during the first half of 
the race, something quirky could kill his chances of winning. Below I recap 
some of the most exciting finishes in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series since 
1993 — the year NASCAR started using precise electronic scoring to run 
its races.
You can check out all the finishes described in this chapter by going to www.
youtube.com. Just type the year and the track name into the search engine. 
The video will be near the top of the results page.
1994 Talladega July Race
Jimmy Spencer, or “Mr. Excitement” as he was known, led teammate and fan 
favorite Bill Elliott over the final few laps. With two laps to go, Spencer looked 
like the sure winner, pacing the field by about one second over Elliott. If 
Elliott ducked down to pass, Spencer ducked down to block. If Elliott went 
high, Spencer went high. The closing lap, as it always does at Talladega, 
induced heart pounding and nail biting. As they approached the finish line, 
Elliott went up the track, and Spencer stayed low. At last, time ran out on 
Elliott. Spencer won by a mere .025 seconds.
2007 Daytona 500
Some call this the greatest Daytona 500 ever. Certainly, the finish was. The 
finish alone proved why race car drivers call the Daytona 500 their most 
coveted victory. I was running a partial schedule at the time but was leading 

272
Part V: The Part of Tens 
the field on the final lap. As the finish line approached, Kevin Harvick in the 
No. 29 Chevrolet inched his way toward me. As the battle waged up front, 
a huge accident ensued behind me and Harvick. Still, this was me versus 
Harvick. As the checkered flag waved, Harvick slipped by me at the line — by 
.020 seconds, the closest Daytona 500 finish in history. The mayhem behind 
us could be summed up by one scene: Clint Bowyer’s No. 07 Chevrolet slid 
across the finish line on its roof.
2005 Homestead
Once again, I was the hard-luck loser in this one, which was even closer than 
the 2007 Daytona 500. Coming out of turn four, my Roush Fenway Racing 
teammate Greg Biffle held the slightest of leads. Biffle slid up the track out 
of the turn, and I dove to the inside to go for the win. The dive gave me some 
momentum — just not enough. Biffle would capture the victory — by just 
.017 seconds. It was his second consecutive win at Homestead.
2004 Rockingham
North Carolina Speedway, located in Rockingham, North Carolina, has a 
nickname: The Rock. Obviously, part of the reason for the tag is its location. 
Another reason: It was hard to drive. The surface was tough on tires and 
produced some very exciting, hard-fought finishes. None was more exciting 
than in 2004 — the last season The Rock hosted NASCAR events.
Reigning NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Matt Kenseth led rookie Kasey 
Kahne on the final lap. Kahne, glued to Kenseth’s back bumper the entire lap, 
tried everything to pass Kenseth. He almost did.
Coming to the start/finish line, Kahne dove to the inside. Kenseth stayed 
high — and crossed the finish line first. The margin of victory was an 
unbelievable .010 seconds.
2000 Atlanta
Usually, it was Dale Earnhardt doing the intimidating. But in Atlanta in 2000, 
Bobby Labonte did his best impression of The Intimidator — as Earnhardt 
will forever be known. Unfortunately for Labonte, the impression came up 
just short.
Labonte bided his time over the last several laps. Not until the final lap did he 
make his move. As the white flag flew for one lap to go, Labonte nudged up 
against Earnhardt’s back bumper.

273
 Chapter 19: NASCAR’s Closest Finishes
Coming out of turn four, Labonte stayed low and took an advantage of inches. 
But Earnhardt refused to relent. The two were side-by-side coming to the 
finish line. Who won? Who knew? Even the commentators were unsure. It was 
Earnhardt, though — by .010 seconds.
1994 July Daytona Race
Clearly Jimmy Spencer likes to give the crowd a show. Spencer won just two 
races in his career — and both crack the top ten in closest finishes.
His win at the July Daytona race in 1994 was simply incredible. The scene 
was part NASCAR, part bumper cars. Spencer ran second as the white flag 
flew. He nabbed the lead from Ernie Irvan with one lap to go, ducking to the 
inside. As the two race car drivers flew side-by-side down the frontstretch 
toward the finish line, the sides of their cars never stopped tapping into 
each other.
Spencer would win that race, the first of his career, by .008 seconds. He led 
just one lap — the final one.
2001 Atlanta
The ending to this race was like something out of a movie. And since it was 
real life, it was just incredible.
At Atlanta in 2001, Kevin Harvick was driving in only his third NASCAR Sprint 
Cup Series race. He was in the lead on the final lap. In second? Jeff Gordon, 
the marquee name in the series. The smart money was on Gordon, who had 
already won three NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championships at the time. 
But Harvick had talent, and fate, on his side. Coming toward the finish line, 
Harvick went way high — almost touching the wall. Gordon stayed low. As 
they approached the finish line, the gap closed up. They steamed toward the 
checkered flag, side by side.
Harvick won the race by just .006 seconds, in a finish fit for Hollywood.
2007 July Daytona race
The year 2007 was a good one at Daytona. Who could’ve thought the July 
race would top the incredible finish in February’s Daytona 500? It did.

274
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Jamie McMurray and Kyle Busch traded the lead a whopping seven times on 
the final lap of the race. Everything favored a Busch win. He was strong all 
night, he was in a powerful Hendrick Motorsports car, and he had his brother 
Kurt right behind him on the final lap.
But McMurray had other plans. With Busch in the lead by inches, McMurray 
nudged ahead right at the stripe — and won by .005 seconds.
1993 Talladega
With one lap to go, Kyle Petty took the lead from Dale Earnhardt, who was 
the king of Talladega. On the bottom, all of a sudden came Ernie Irvan. It 
looked to be a three-horse finish.
But Earnhardt easily took the lead away from Petty, leaving glory to either 
Earnhardt or Irvan. For much of the final lap, no one knew who would reign 
victorious.
Coming out of turn four, Irvan held a slight advantage. He had the inside line, 
which looked like the best position to finish first. But this was Earnhardt’s 
terrain. He had ten career wins at Talladega, after all. He didn’t give up 
position easily, and he didn’t this time. Earnhardt pounded the gas, winning 
yet again — by .005 seconds.
2003 Darlington
It is fitting that the closest finish since the advent of electronic scoring in 
1993 occurred at NASCAR’s most historic facility: Darlington Raceway.
The battle between Kurt Busch and Ricky Craven began with three laps to 
go. Neither driver would give up an inch of position without a fierce fight. 
Literally, the two were beating and banging during the entire final three laps. 
Busch even scraped the wall a time or two.
Coming out of turn four, Craven dove to the inside. The momentum brought 
both race car drivers together. They were scraping each other coming 
toward the finish line — smoke from their contact rub filled their rearview 
mirrors.
In a near dead heat, Craven won the race. As he crossed the finish line, his 
car swerved and slid up against the wall. His crew would have to do a lot of 
detail work leading up to the next race. But no big deal — they had just been 
victorious in the closest finish ever.

In this part . . .
P
art of the fun of getting into a new sport (as well as 
the fun of being an old hand) is knowing all those 
facts that make you seem so smart. In this part, I help you 
get up to speed on NASCAR jargon, statistics, race car 
numbers, and milestones.

Appendix A
Glossary
Aerodynamics
Refers to how the air flows over the surfaces and under the body of a car. It 
also includes the wake of turbulent air left behind a car as it travels.
A-Frame
Either the upper or lower connecting suspension piece (shaped like an A) 
that locks the frame to the spindle.
Air dam
An extension below the front bumper that blocks air as it hits the front of a 
car, preventing too much air from flowing under the vehicle and reducing the 
car’s speed and stability. It plays a big role in the aerodynamics of a car by 
keeping the front end stable.
Apron
The paved portion of a race track that separates the racing surface from the 
infield.
Associate sponsors
Companies that sponsor racing teams. They pay less money and, in turn, get 
less exposure on the car or the uniform than the primary sponsors do.
Backstretch
The straight section of the track located on the side of the track opposite the 
start/finish line. On an oval track, it’s between the second and third turns.
Banking
The sloping of a race track, particularly at a curve or corner, from the apron 
to the outside wall. Degree of banking refers to the angle or steepness of a 
track’s slope at its outside edge.
Being on the lead lap
When a driver has completed the same number of laps as the leader.

Part VI: Appendixes 
Camber
The amount that a tire is tilted from vertical so that more of the tire surface 
can touch more of the racing surface in a banked turn.
Car chief
The team mechanic who works most closely with the crew chief in figuring 
out setups for the car. He directs the rest of the car crew, who physically 
make the changes (although car chiefs often do hands-on work, too).
Carburetor
The device above the engine where air and fuel mix on their way into an 
internal combustion engine.
Carburetor restrictor plate
A thin metal plate with four holes that restrict the flow of air into an engine’s 
carburetor, thus reducing horsepower and speed. It’s used only at super-
speedways Daytona and Talladega to keep speeds below 200 mph.
Catch can man
During pit stops, the person who stands behind the car on the left side and 
holds a special container at the end of the car to collect gas that overflows 
from the gas tank after it’s filled.
Caution flag
A yellow flag waved by the flagman in the starter’s stand to indicate trouble 
on the race track, including oil or debris on the racing surface. It signals 
drivers to slow down and follow the pace car around the track.
Champion’s provisional
The last (or 43rd) starting spot given out for a race. Former series champions 
are eligible to use it if they don’t make the race based on their qualifying 
speed. See also provisional entry.
Chassis
The steel frame or undercarriage of a car.
Chassis dynamometer
A machine that measures the amount of power translated from the wheels to 
the ground.

279
 Appendix A: Glossary
Compression ratio
The volume of a cylinder compared to the compressed volume when the 
piston is fully extended. The higher the compression ratio, the more 
horsepower.
Contingency programs
Bonus money given by companies whose products a driver uses or whose 
decals a driver runs on his car.
C-Post
The post extending from the roofline of a race car to the base of the rear 
window to the top of the deck lid.
Crew chief
The leader of the race team who oversees employees and handles the build-
ing and fine-tuning of a race car. He’s responsible for deciding which changes 
to make to the race car throughout race weekend and what race strategies to 
use on race day.
Deck lid
The rear trunk lid of a race car. It opens like the trunk lid of a passenger car 
and allows access to the fuel cell.
Displacement
The size of an engine measured in cubic inches. A NASCAR Sprint Cup Series 
car’s engine can’t be larger than 358 cubic inches.
Donuts
Slang term for the black, circular, dent-like marks on the side panels of stock 
cars, usually caused by rubbing against other cars at high speed.
Downforce
The air pressure and downward force that pushes a car onto the track, 
causing it to stick to the racing surface. It keeps cars from losing traction 
at high speeds, especially going through the turns.
Drafting
When drivers race in single file on large speedways and share air flow among 
their cars. Cars cut through the air much faster together than they do 
separately — the first car creates a vacuum effect that actually pulls the car 
behind it.

280
Part VI: Appendixes 
Drag
The aerodynamic force of resistance that hinders a race car as it moves 
through air. It’s caused by air flowing beneath the car and lifting it higher in 
the air, as well as air flowing through the cooling system, ducts in the body, 
and open windows. Air travels into these openings instead of smoothly 
sliding over the car. With less drag, a car can accelerate faster, especially at 
higher speeds, because the car needs less horsepower to move forward 
through the air.
Engine builder
The team member in charge of building engines and coaching people to build 
engines nearly from scratch. His goal is to make each engine as lightweight — 
but still as durable — as possible. The engine builder is in charge of the 
engine assemblers, who actually put the engine together.
Engine specialist
The team member in charge of preparing the engines at the race shop and 
then taking care of and tuning them after they get to the race track. Also 
called the engine tuner.
Esses
Slang term used for a series of acute left- and right-hand turns on a road 
course, one turn immediately following another.
Fabricator
The team member who puts sheet metal on the car’s frame and molds it to 
the shape of the car, creating the body or outside shell of the car.
Five-point seat belts
Five belts that come together at the center of a driver’s chest. Each of the 
belts passes through a steel guide that is welded onto the car’s frame. One 
belt goes over a driver’s left shoulder, one goes over his right shoulder, 
another comes from the left side of the seat, one comes from the right side of 
the seat, and still another goes between a driver’s legs. They’re all latched 
together at a single point with a quick-release buckle.
Flags
 
✓ Green: The race is started.
 
✓ Yellow: Caution — all drivers must slow down.
 
✓ Red: All drivers must stop.
 
✓ Black: The driver at whom the black flag is waved must get off the track.
 
✓ White: The lead car has one lap to go.

281
 Appendix A: Glossary
 
✓ Blue with diagonal yellow stripe: Signals a slow driver to move over.
 
✓ Green–white–checkered sequence: Used near the end of the race in an 
attempt to keep it from finishing under caution. Can add as many as two 
laps to the length of the race.
 
✓ Checkered: The winning car has crossed the finish line.
Frontstretch
The straight section of a race track between the first and last turns.
Fuel cell
A rectangular rubber holding tank for a race car’s supply of gasoline. A 
NASCAR fuel cell holds 17.75 gallons.
Garage pass
A permit that lets someone into the garage area during a race weekend. It’s 
obtained through the race track or through NASCAR and reserved for people 
who know someone who works in the sport (at the race track, as a sponsor, 
on a team, and so on). Also called a pit pass.
Gas-and-go
A quick pit stop where a car gets only gas — no new tires.
Gas man
The pit crew member who steps over the pit wall carrying an 85-pound, 
12-gallon can of gas and fills the gas tank. When the first can empties, he 
usually gets a second can from the second gas man (who doesn’t go over 
the wall) and finishes filling the tank.
General mechanics
Crew members who help the car chief set up the car, build shocks back in 
the trailer, rework the body of a car after a driver crashes it into the wall, 
and so on. They’re not specialized.
Getting hung out to dry
Racing slang that means a driver has lost the draft and is losing positions 
by the split second. To remedy the situation, the driver must get back in 
line with other cars where the aerodynamics are much more conducive to 
going fast.
Going behind the wall
What happens when a car is too damaged to be repaired on pit road. The 
team brings it to the garage behind the pit wall.

282
Part VI: Appendixes 
Handling
How a car responds on the track. A car’s handling is determined by how it 
was built (including its suspension, tires, aerodynamics, and body style) and 
how it’s prepared for the race.
Hanging a body
Sizing sheet metal, cutting sheet metal, and then molding it onto a car’s frame 
to form the shell of a car.
Happy Hour
The final hour of practice before an event, usually held in the late afternoon 
the day before the race.
Hat dance
When a race winner puts on dozens of baseball caps with sponsors’ logos on 
them in Victory Lane. Each time a driver puts a cap on, photographers snap 
photos to send or sell to the sponsor involved.
Hitting points
Driving the fastest route around the track, which a driver has mapped out in 
his head. Usually, a driver will record in his mind various small marks or 
other points of reference around the track, especially entering and exiting the 
turns, and then will try to visually hit those spots each time around the track. 
Also called hitting marks.
Horsepower
A unit of measurement representing how much power an engine generates.
Inspections
The process NASCAR officials go through to approve cars to race, qualify, 
and practice.
Intermediate track
A track more than 1 mile long but less than 2 miles. See also short track and 
superspeedway.
Jackman
The pit crew member who positions the jack under a specific spot on each 
side of the car, pumps the handle of the jack one or two times so that it lifts 
the car off the ground enough for the tire changers to change the tires, and 
then drops the jack and lowers the car.

283
 Appendix A: Glossary
Lapped traffic
Cars that aren’t on the lead lap. These cars are usually considerably slower 
than the leaders.
Licensee
A person or entity who sells NASCAR goods and must pay royalty payments 
to the licensor (who gives the rights to sell the goods) at prearranged times.
Licensor
A person or entity who gives the rights to sell NASCAR or race team goods, 
receiving royalty payments from the licensee (who sells the goods) in return.
Loose
A term used to describe a car whose rear end starts to fishtail when going 
through a turn, making the driver feel as if he’s losing control of the car 
and about to spin out. The rear tires aren’t sticking well to the track and 
providing enough traction. This is also called oversteer. See also tight.
Lug nuts
Large nuts that secure tires in place. All NASCAR cars use five lug nuts on 
each wheel, and penalties are assessed if a team fails to put on all five during 
a pit stop.
Modern era
The period in NASCAR history that began in 1972, when a new points system 
and a radically streamlined schedule were introduced.
Motor home lot
The area where drivers and owners park their motor homes during race 
weekend.

stands for the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing.

284
Part VI: Appendixes 
NASCAR Camping World Truck Series
The newest of the three national NASCAR series, featuring full-bodied pick-up 
trucks. The series started in 1995.
NASCAR Nationwide Series
A national racing series in which many drivers begin their professional 
careers. Drivers train themselves and hone their driving skills before moving 
up to the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series
The top series of NASCAR.
One-groove race track
A race track that has just one route around it where cars can stick to the 
track and handle well. If a driver gets out of that path, he may not get enough 
grip to keep his car stable — and that means he could end up in the wall. 
Some tracks have more than one groove — a high groove and a low groove — 
meaning cars can run side-by-side around the track. Some tracks have no 
particular groove because cars race easily on any part of the track.
Owner
The owner of the entire racing team. He or she has a financial stake in the 
race team and therefore has final say in hiring everyone who works on the 
team, from the driver to the crew chief to everyone who prepares the cars for 
racing. The owner must also secure a sponsor to help pay the bills.
Paint scheme
The way a car is painted and decorated.
Panhard bar
See track bar.

pit stop.
Pit pass
See garage pass.

285
 Appendix A: Glossary
Pit road
A separate road inside a race track that usually runs parallel to a track’s 
frontstretch. It’s where cars go when they need gas, tires, or repairs.

pit box by the pit wall.
Pit stop
When a driver pulls off the race track and travels down pit road where the 
crew services his car.
Pit wall
The cement wall separating the pit box from the pit stalls.
Pit window
An estimate of the range of laps the crew thinks the driver can go before 
needing to make a pit stop to refuel.
Pole winner (pole sitter)
The driver who records the fastest lap during qualifying and is rewarded by 
starting the race from the inside (closest to the grass) of the two-car front 
row. The outside pole winner is the driver who had the second-fastest lap 
during qualifying. He starts the race from the outside of the front row.
Primary sponsor
A company or entity that pays the most money to a team. Primary sponsors 
get their decals on the car hoods, which is the best place to advertise 
because fans see them so well.
Provisional entry
A guaranteed spot in a race given to regular series drivers who qualify poorly 
during the weekend but who are high enough in points. See also champion’s 
provisional.
Quad oval
A modified oval race track with two extra slight turns entering both the 
frontstretch and backstretch.
Radio frequency scanner
See scanner.

286
Part VI: Appendixes 
Rear spoiler
A metal blade that runs the width of the car atop the back of its trunk. It 
regulates air as it flows over a car and helps push the back end of the car 
into the track, which gives the car more traction and better handling. The 
rear spoiler is used primarily in the NASCAR Nationwide Series.
Rear wing
Used on the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car. The wing, attached to the trunk 
lid, stabilizes the car in traffic. It decreases the rear downforce, which makes 
the car more challenging to the driver. There are adjustable end plates on 
each side of the wing.
Relief driver
A driver who replaces the original driver because of an injury or illness.
Restart
The waving of the green flag following a caution period.
Road courses
Race tracks with complex configurations of left and right turns at varying 
angles. The track may have elevation changes as well. Infineon Raceway and 
Watkins Glen International are the only two NASCAR Sprint Cup Series road 
courses.
Roll bars
The part of the car’s frame that protects the driver because it’s made of 
strong steel tubing with a standardized thickness.
Roll cage
The protective frame of steel surrounding a driver. It keeps the driver safe 
during an accident because it protects him from the impact of another car or 
of a wall if the car flips over. The roll cage consists of roll bars made from 
steel tubing.
Roof flaps
Rectangular pieces of metal attached to the roof of a car that lie flat when the 
car is moving forward but pop into the air when a car spins backwards or 
sideways, helping to prevent a car from becoming airborne.
Rounds of wedge
Putting rounds of wedge into a car means a crew member is adjusting the 
handling by changing the pressure on the rear springs.

287
 Appendix A: Glossary
RPM
Short for revolutions per minute, a measurement of how fast an engine is 
turning and how hard it’s working. See also tachometer.
Rubber
A piece of rubber (also known as a spring rubber) placed between the coils of 
a spring to increase tension and taken out to decrease tension. It changes 
how a car handles.
Running wide open
When drivers depress the accelerator all the way to the ground.
Saving tires
When a driver takes it easy through the turns and doesn’t run the car too 
hard in order to keep his tires from wearing out too early.
Scanner
A small instrument that picks up radio waves in the immediate area. It allows 
you to listen in on conversations between drivers and their crews during 
practice, qualifying, and races.
Scuffs
Tires that have been on the car during practice, used for only one or two 
laps. See also sticker tires.
Setup
The way a car is prepared for qualifying and a race, including the suspension 
package, weight distribution, and engine tuning.
Shock absorbers
Hydraulic cylinders attached to the car’s wheels that make the car ride more 
smoothly over bumps.
Shock dynamometer
A machine that pumps the shock absorber up and down, feeding information 
to the team’s computer.
Short track
A race track shorter than 1 mile in length, where aerodynamics and horse-
power aren’t particularly important in winning the race. Bristol Motor 
Speedway, Martinsville Speedway, and Richmond International Raceway 
are the three NASCAR short tracks. See also intermediate track and 
superspeedway.

288
Part VI: Appendixes 
Show car
A former race car that was taken out of the rotation for being too old, 
suffering irreparable damage, or just not being suited to the driver.
Silly season
Slang for a rumor-filled period that begins during the latter part of the 
current season, wherein some teams contemplate or announce driver, crew, 
and/or sponsor changes for the following year.
Slingshot
A maneuver in which a car following the leader in a draft suddenly steers 
around it, breaking the vacuum and providing an extra burst of speed that 
allows the second car to take the lead.
Splitter
Made from a lightweight polypropylene, it is part of the new car in the 
NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The splitter is below the air dam on the front of 
the car. It helps strike an aerodynamic balance with the rear wing.
Spotter
The team member who watches a race from on top of the grandstands or press 
box. His job is to be the driver’s second set of eyes, telling the driver where to 
go on the race track to avoid an accident or when to pass another car.
Sticker tires
New tires that still have the manufacturer’s sticker on them. See also scuffs.
Stop-and-go penalty
When a driver must come down pit road, stop in his pit box for a moment, 
and then drive down pit road to the race track.
Superspeedway
A race track of a mile or more in distance. This includes intermediate tracks 
and tracks that are longer than 2 miles.
Suspension
The system of springs, shock absorbers, sway bars, and so on, directly con-
nected to the wheels or the axles, which affects the handling of a race car.
Sway bars
An automobile’s suspension device. It alters the amount a car rolls to one 
side or the other through the turns.

289
 Appendix A: Glossary
Tachometer
The instrument used to measure the number of revolutions per minute. 
Drivers use it to determine how fast they are going. See also rpm.
Taping a car off
Placing tape over the radiator grille of the car in order to keep air from 
entering the radiator and slowing the car down. Crews do this to improve 
aerodynamics, but only during qualifying because the engine would 
overheat and fail if taped off during a race.
Team hauler
A large semi-truck where the team hangs out when they’re not working on 
their car. It’s a place to eat and hold meetings at the race track. Some people 
even take naps in the forward lounge.
Tearing down
When cars are torn down, teams take apart the engines and whatever else 
NASCAR officials want them to. The winning team goes through a thorough 
tear down, meaning it takes apart the engine, the suspension, the power 
train, or whatever else officials want to check out.
Tech
NASCAR lingo for technical inspection. See also inspections.
Templates
A device with a hanging metal frame conforming to the car’s shape. It’s used 
to check the car’s shape and ensure compliance with NASCAR specifications.
Tight
When the front tires don’t turn well through the turns because they’re losing 
traction before the rear tires are. When a car is tight, it also means it’s 
pushing — and if a driver isn’t careful, he’ll end up zooming right into the 
wall. See also loose.
Tire carrier
The pit crew member who hands the tires to the tire changers and takes the 
used tires away.
Tire changers
Pit crew members who change tires — one changes the front tires, and 
another changes the rear tires.

290
Part VI: Appendixes 
Tire specialist
The team member who changes the air pressure, measures the wear, and 
monitors the temperature of the tires during practice, qualifying, and races.
Track bar
The part of the rear suspension that’s attached to the frame on one side and 
to the rear axle on the other. It keeps the car’s rear tires centered within the 
car’s body. Also called the Panhard bar.
Transponder
A transmitter that teams attach to the right side of the car’s fuel cell con-
tainer. It’s used for timing and scoring.
Tri-oval
A modified oval race track with an extra turn to it (albeit a slight turn) 
instead of just four turns. Usually that turn is located midway down the 
frontstretch.
Victory Lane
A roped-off or fenced-in area located in the infield where drivers, crews, 
owners, sponsors, and their families celebrate a victory.
Wedge
Putting in wedge means putting more weight onto a wheel by compressing 
the spring. Teams can put wedge into only the rear tires during a race by 
inserting a wrench into a hole above the tires. A round of wedge is also called 
a round of bite.
Wheelbase
The distance between the axles on the same side of the car.
Wind tunnel
A tunnel that shoots wind at a car. It’s used to research how a car cuts 
through air as it moves forward. The car can be rotated so the tunnel shoots 
wind at the car from all different angles.
Window nets
Screens made of a nylon mesh material that cover the driver’s side window. 
They keep the driver’s arms and head in the car in the event of an accident.

Race Car Numbers
I
n NASCAR racing, each car has its own car number, just as each pro 
basketball player has a number on his or her jersey. It’s an easy way to 
identify a car on the track, especially when you can’t see the driver’s face as 
he zooms by or read his name on the car. If you want to be a knowledgeable 
race fan and fit in with the race crowd, car numbers are vital to know. A lot 
of times, people refer to a car number only, not the team name or driver. A 
person may say, “The 17 was the strongest car out there, don’t you think?” 
What he just said was that he thought Matt Kenseth’s Ford Fusion was great 
that day.
Teams have to apply for their car number at the beginning of each season. 
However, a few drivers have become linked to their car numbers for eternity, 
such as Dale Earnhardt and his No. 3 Chevy (which hasn’t been used since 
his 2001 death) or Richard Petty and his No. 43 car. Jeff Gordon will always 
be known as the driver of the No. 24 Chevy — particularly since he plans to 
drive that car until he retires.
Look for the following race car numbers to locate your favorite drivers during

NASCAR Milestones
A
ll major sports undergo change, and NASCAR is no exception. In the 
beginning, the strictly stock division cars were driven off the street 
and onto the track. But as safety technology advanced, alterations were 
made to the cars; the racing machines of today are more complicated than 
ever. NASCAR itself also has grown with the series from a small organization 
formed on the beaches of Daytona to one of the premier sports in America. 
This appendix gives you a rundown of important NASCAR milestones.
December 14, 1947: Bill France, Sr. organizes a meeting at the Streamline 
Hotel in Daytona Beach, Florida, to discuss the future of stock car racing. 
The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is conceived.
