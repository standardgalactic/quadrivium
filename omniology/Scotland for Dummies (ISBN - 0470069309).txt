xviii Scotland For Dummies, 4th Edition 

Introduction
T
his guide is a departure from conventional travel guidebooks. Rather
than just throwing out dizzying reams of information for you to sift
through until you’re too tired to distinguish Edinburgh from Inverness,
Scotland For Dummies, 4th Edition, separates the old wheat from the
chaff (so you don’t have to).
This book walks you through the whole process of putting together your
trip to Scotland, from the ins and outs of a manageable itinerary to advice
on choosing the right places to stay or how much time to allot for attrac-
tions and activities. My recommendations may not be perfect for every-
one, of course. The goal here is to help you see what may interest you
(whether it’s castles, museums, pubs, or open countryside) and what
probably will not. Your time is valuable, so this book strives to get right
to the point. Scotland For Dummies, 4th Edition, is designed to give you a
clear picture of what you need to know and what your options are, so
that you can make informed decisions easily and efficiently about travel-
ing in Scotland.
About This Book
Some parts of Scotland are bound to interest you more than others, so
don’t feel as if you have to read this book cover to cover. If you want to
focus on the metropolitan life, for example, then simply concentrate on
Part III’s chapters devoted to Edinburgh and Glasgow. If the lore of the
Loch Ness monster, or the lure of the Hebridean islands, intrigues you,
then you can find valuable information in Part VI. And if you’re drawn to
picturesque settings that are less touristy than the famous attractions,
then Scotland For Dummies, 4th Edition, can point you in the right direc-
tion as well.
Although the information is laid out in the logical order of a step-by-step
manual, you don’t need to read the book in order from front to back.
You’re also not expected to remember everything you read — you can
just look up and revisit specific information as you need it. Each section
and chapter is as self-contained as possible, a feature that allows you to
concentrate on what’s important to you (and skip the rest).
Of course this guide has up-to-date information on the best hotels and
restaurants in Scotland’s major cities and regions. But it also has infor-
mation on shopping and nightlife, attractions, walking tours, helpful his-
torical asides, and details on those things that make Scotland unique,
too — whether that’s golf courses or the tallest mountains and most
pristine seas in the entire United Kingdom.

Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this is especially true of prices. It never hurts to check the
Internet or write or call ahead for confirmation of the “current” situation
when making your travel plans. The author, editors, and publisher can’t
be held responsible for the experiences of readers while traveling. Your
safety is important to us, however, so we encourage you to stay alert
and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a close eye on cameras,
purses, and wallets, all favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
The goal of Scotland For Dummies, 4th Edition, is to be a quick read in
any order that you desire, so the listings for hotels, restaurants, and
sights are consistently standardized throughout the chapters. Each list-
ing offers you an idea of what the place is like and then gives you details
about specific addresses, prices, and hours of operation.
Other conventions include:
 Abbreviations for commonly accepted credit cards used through-
out this book.
• AE: American Express
• DC: Diners Club
• MC: MasterCard
• V: Visa
 An alphabetical listing of hotels, restaurants, and attractions in
each chapter.
 Page references for maps, given whenever possible, to help you
locate hotels, restaurants, attractions, and the like. If a hotel,
restaurant, or attraction is in an out-of-the-way area, however, it
may not appear on a map. In chapters on the major cities, informa-
tion about bus routes, and, in Glasgow, subway stops, is given as
well.
Scotland For Dummies, 4th Edition

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you’re reading this book, you’ll come across information that you may want to ref-
erence as you plan or enjoy your trip — whether it be a new hotel, a must-see attrac-
tion, or a must-try walking tour. Use the handy Post-it® Flags included in this book to
mark particular pages and make your trip planning easier!

 Prices listed in British pounds sterling (£), with the dollar equiva-
lent given in parentheses. The conversion rate (always changing in
the real world, of course) used to make these calculations is £1
equals $1.85.
Price is normally a factor when choosing hotels and restaurants. The rel-
ative costs of accommodations and meals are indicated with dollar signs.
Specific prices are given, too, but the dollar signs are a quick way for
you to see if a place is in your price category before reading any more
information. My scale for accommodations and restaurants ranges from
one dollar sign ($) to four ($$$$). Most hotel prices are per night for
double rooms (rather than per person per night). The cost of a meal gen-
erally means dinner with at least two courses and a drink per person.
The following table helps you decipher what the dollar signs mean.
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
Less than £55 ($100)
About £10 ($19)
$$
£55–£120 ($100–$225)
£10–£25 ($19–$48)
$$$
£121–£175 ($226–$330)
£26–£35 ($50–$70)
$$$$
More than £176 ($332)
More than £35 ($70)
The hotels in Chapters 11 and 12 are divided into two categories —
favorites and those that don’t quite make my preferred list, but still get
my seal of approval. Don’t hesitate to consider the “runner-up” hotels —
the amenities and the services they offer make them all reasonable
choices as you decide where to rest your head at night.
Foolish Assumptions
This book makes some assumptions about you and what your needs
may be as a traveler. Here’s what I’ve assumed about you.
 You’re an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Scotland but wants expert advice when you finally do get a
chance to enjoy any part of the region.
 You’re an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when deter-
mining whether to take a trip to Scotland and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Scotland or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attrac-
tion available to you. Instead, you want a book that focuses on the
places that will give you the best or most unique experience in
Scotland.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Scotland For Dummies, 4th Edition, is
the book for you.
Introduction 3

How This Book Is Organized
Scotland For Dummies, 4th Edition, consists of five parts. The chapters
within each part cover specific components in detail.
Part I: Introducing Scotland
This part introduces you to the very best of Scotland and touches on
issues you need to consider before actually getting down to the nitty-
gritty of trip planning. It includes a brief history of Scotland as well as
recommended reading, when and where to go, and detailed itineraries to
consider.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland
This part gets down to the nuts and bolts of travel planning, including
information on managing your money, how best to get to Scotland, get-
ting around the country, and reserving hotel rooms. It also addresses
special considerations for families, seniors, travelers with disabilities,
and students, as well as gay and lesbian travelers.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow
You may only have time to see the two major cities in Scotland, and so
I’ve devoted an entire chapter to each, with details on hotels, restau-
rants, top attractions, shopping, walking tours, and nightlife. Plus, you
can find information on how to get around, how much time you need to
see things, suggested itineraries, and recommended side trips.
Part IV: The Major Regions
This part offers chapters on Scotland’s major regions: from Southern
Scotland to the Highlands, from Ayrshire and Argyll to the Hebridean
Islands. Each chapter has suggestions on accommodations, places to
dine out, and attractions, not to mention some useful information on
shopping and nightlife. For a more thorough overview of Scotland,
including a brief description of these regions, flip to Chapter 3.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. These more breezy chapters
have quick and handy lists that highlight the best golf courses, castles,
natural attractions, and more in Scotland.
In the back of this book, I’ve included an appendix — your Quick
Concierge — containing lots of handy information you may need when
traveling in Scotland, such as phone numbers and addresses of emer-
gency personnel or area hospitals and pharmacies, lists of local newspa-
pers and magazines, protocol for sending mail or finding taxis, and more.
Check out this appendix when you’re faced with the little questions that
may come up as you travel. The Quick Concierge is easy to find because
it’s printed on yellow paper.

Icons Used in This Book
You can’t miss the icons (little pictures) sprinkled throughout the mar-
gins of this book. Think of them as signposts that highlight special tips,
draw your attention to things you don’t want to miss, and give you a
heads-up on a variety of topics.
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or great deals.
Best of the Best icons highlight the best each destination has to offer in
all categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping,
and nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
This icon points to useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule
your time.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
This icon points out secret little finds or useful resources that are worth
the extra bit of effort to get to or find.
Where to Go from Here
This travel guide isn’t designed to be read from beginning to end
(although you’re certainly welcome to do so). Instead, it provides
detailed and well-organized information on loads of topics — from get-
ting your passport to finding the best restaurants. So, choose your own
adventure and look for the topics or destinations you want to explore by
using the Table of Contents or the Index.
As you start to prepare for your visit to Scotland, remember this: The
planning is half the fun. Don’t make choosing your destinations and
solidifying the details feel like a chore. Make the homebound part of the
process a voyage of discovery, and you’ll end up with a vacation that’s
much more rewarding and enriching. See you in Scotland!

Part I
Introducing
Scotland

In this part . . .
S
cotland — with its rich, evocative past — has much to
offer the traveler. But visitors don’t come here just for
the history: The country’s vibrant cities, natural beauty,
indigenous culture, and friendly people are all additional
draws.
This part suggests Scotland’s best, from hotels and restau-
rants to castles and art galleries. You’ll ﬁnd useful itineraries
to help you decide what to see if your time is limited. This
part also contains a condensed history, a glossary of the
Scots language, a list of suggested books and ﬁlms to help get
you in the mood, and lots more. When’s the best season to
visit? Are discounts available for seniors or children? What,
for heaven’s sake, is haggis? Look no further; the answers 
are here.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best 
of Scotland
In This Chapter
 Staying in the top hotels and dining in the best restaurants
 Discovering the best castles and museums
 Drinking in the best pubs and bars
T
o start things off, I begin with some of the highlights: the best that
Scotland has to offer visitors, from memorable travel experiences,
excellent hotels, or top-rated restaurants to first-class castles, museums,
golf courses, pubs, and more. (Each entry is listed not by preference,
however, but in alphabetical order under each main heading.) Many of
these are highlighted by those alluring “Best of the Best” icons when
they appear elsewhere in this book: So keep your eyes peeled.
The Best Travel Experiences
 Ardnamurchan Peninsula: One of the more easily reached but
seemingly remote areas of the Highlands, the peninsula is the most
westerly point in the entire British mainland. See Chapter 18.
 Butt of Lewis: On the Isle of Lewis, these beautiful high cliffs over
the ocean have views that are worth the drive to the tip of the
island. You can see seabirds, seals, and spectacular windblown
waves crashing against the rocks. See Chapter 19.
 Edinburgh Old Town: This area is probably the most visited loca-
tion in Scotland and not without good reason. Running along the
spine of a hill and extending from the castle to the Palace of
Holyroodhouse, Old Town is a delight to wander through. Make
sure you take time to explore the alleyways. See Chapter 11.
 Glasgow City Centre: This area shows off the thriving heart of a
modern European city, with some of the finest examples of
Victorian architecture in all the world. It’s set out on a grid, so you
don’t need to worry about getting lost. See Chapter 12.

 Glen Coe: With a visitor center near Glencoe village, Glen Coe 
is such a beautiful valley that it’s hard to reconcile the natural
beauty with the bloody historical event that took place there. 
See Chapter 18.
 The Hebrides: If you like unspoiled scenery, windswept sands,
quiet country lanes, craggy shorelines, and the occasional ferry
ride, then you must go to see some of the islands off of Scotland’s
west coast. See Chapter 19.
 Loch Lomond: Located quite near Glasgow, this loch is the largest
inland body of water in all of Great Britain. It’s only about a 30- to 45-
minute drive or train ride from the Glasgow city limits. When you
reach the loch, you can hike, canoe, or just relax. See Chapter 16.
 Loch Ness: This loch is mysterious and legendary — if somewhat
overrated. In addition to looking for the elusive monster, you
should seek out other local attractions, such as Urquhart Castle.
See Chapter 18.
 Sands of Morar: Near Mallaig, the Sands of Morar offer beautiful
bleached beaches set against postcard-pretty seas. You can see the
Hebridean islands Rhum and Eigg from here. See Chapter 18.
 Sandwood Bay: This area near Blairmore has a beach that, by most
accounts, is the most beautiful and unsullied in all of Great Britain’s
mainland. See Chapter 18.
The Best Accommodations 
in Edinburgh and Glasgow
Edinburgh
 Best Boutique Hotel: The Bonham. In an upscale, western New
Town neighborhood, The Bonham offers some of the most alluring
accommodations in a city filled with fine hotels. See Chapter 11.
 Best Traditional Hotel: Balmoral. With a Michelin-star restaurant,
doormen in kilts, and a romantic pile to rival any others, Balmoral
is legendary, and its location is smack in the heart of the capital.
See Chapter 11.
 Best Rooms near the Castle: The Witchery by the Castle. As its list
of celebrity guests testifies, the Witchery offers opulence and indi-
viduality in a manner not seen anywhere else in the Old Town. See
Chapter 11.
 Best Hotel in Leith: Malmaison. At the port of Leith, Malmaison is
about a 15-minute ride north of Edinburgh’s center. Named after
Joséphine’s mansion outside Paris, the hotel celebrates the Auld
Alliance of France and Scotland and occupies a Victorian building
built in 1900. See Chapter 11.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
10

 Best Hotel Health Spa: Sheraton Grand. Near the city’s conference
center, the Sheraton Grand has wonderful facilities in an adjoining
building. Especially noteworthy is the roof-top indoor/outdoor
pool. See Chapter 11.
Glasgow
 Best Boutique Hotel: One Devonshire Gardens. In a West End
neighborhood filled with similar sandstone-fronted town houses,
One Devonshire Gardens still stands out. It’s a re-creation of a high-
bourgeois, very proper Scottish home from the early 1900s, boast-
ing antique furnishings and discreetly concealed modern comforts.
See Chapter 12.
 Best Hip Hotel: Brunswick Hotel. With only 18 rooms, the
Brunswick Hotel exudes cool in the city’s Merchant City. The design
is modern and minimalist but is executed with character and class.
See Chapter 12.
 Best in the Commercial Centre: Malmaison. Linked to the hotel
with the same name in Edinburgh (see listing in previous section),
this Malmaison is in a building that dates from the 1800s. It wel-
comes visitors with Scottish hospitality and houses them with
quite a bit of style. See Chapter 12.
 Best Moderately Priced Hotel: The Town House. Near One
Devonshire Gardens, it may lack that hotel’s posh quotient, but this
small guest house is very comfortable and pretty classy, too. See
Chapter 12.
The Best Small and Country House Hotels
 An Lochan, Tighnabruaich, Argyll: Formerly the Royal, this hotel
dates to the mid–19th century, but today it is fully modernized
inside, with plush rooms that overlook the sea and the hotel’s own
moorings. Great fish and seafood, too. See Chapter 15.
 Ardanaiseig, Kilchrenan, Argyll: This stone Scottish baronial pile
built in the 1830s offers a bit of luxury in an out-of-the-way corner.
See Chapter 15.
 Argyll Hotel, Iona, the Hebrides: This charming traditional hotel in
the village of Iona is comfortable and environmentally conscious,
with its own organic garden and an ethos of not disturbing the frag-
ile island ecology. See Chapter 19.
 Ballachulish House, Ballachulish, the Highlands: This 17th-century
laird’s house includes a history said to be the inspiration for key
passages in Robert Louis Stevenson’s masterpiece, Kidnapped. See
Chapter 18.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Scotland 11

 Darroch Learg, Ballater, the Northeast: This hotel is one of the
more highly regarded hotels in the Royal Deeside region near the
Queen’s estate at Balmoral. See Chapter 17.
 Glenapp Castle, Ballantrae, South Ayrshire: Glenapp is a beautifully
decorated pile close to Stranraer, with Victorian baronial splendor
and antiques, oil paintings, and elegant touches. See Chapter 14.
 Glengarry Castle Hotel, Invergarry, the Highlands: The 26-room
Victorian mansion, with its own castle ruins (the real Glengarry
Castle), is on extensive wooded grounds with nice views of Loch
Oich. See Chapter 18.
 Knockinaam Lodge, near Portpatrick, Dumfries, and Galloway:
With a Michelin-star restaurant, Knockinaam combines exquisite
meals with a secluded seaside setting on the Rhinns of Galloway.
See Chapter 14.
 Prestonfield, Edinburgh: Although in the city, this hotel rises 
in Jacobean splendor amid gardens, pastures, and woodlands
below Arthur’s Seat on the south side of the Scottish capital. 
See Chapter 11.
The Best Dining in Edinburgh and Glasgow
Edinburgh
 Best French Restaurant: Restaurant Martin Wishart. With one of
the city’s precious Michelin stars and its most talented chef/owner,
Restaurant Martin Wishart is where the leading out-of-town chefs
dine when they visit Edinburgh. See Chapter 11.
 Best Cafe: Spoon. In the heart of Old Town, Spoon forks out some
the best salads and sandwiches in Edinburgh — and the freshly
made soups are even better. See Chapter 11.
 Best Italian Restaurant: Santini. Although many of the more estab-
lished Italian restaurants in town don’t like hearing it, Santini con-
tinually gets rave reviews and sets the highest standards. See
Chapter 11.
 Best Modern Scottish Restaurant: Atrium. Owned by Andrew and
Lisa Radford, Atrium offers dishes prepared with flair and imagina-
tion but not excessive amounts of fuss or over-fancy presentation.
See Chapter 11.
 Best Restaurant Views: Oloroso or Forth Floor. This category is a
dead heat between Oloroso and Forth Floor at Harvey Nichols.
Both offer wonderful preparation of fresh Scottish produce to go
with those scenic vistas. See Chapter 11.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
12

Glasgow
 Best Fine Dining Restaurant: Michael Caines @ ABode. A fairly
new arrival, but the eponymous owner/chef has two Michelin stars
to his name. The staff he has hired for this branch in Glasgow has
aspirations for stars of their own. See Chapter 12.
 Best Indian Restaurant: The Dhabba. Glasgow loves its Indian cui-
sine, but this restaurant offers something a bit better than most,
favoring dishes from the northern part of the subcontinent. See
Chapter 12.
 Best Modern Scottish Restaurant: The Wild Bergamot. In the
northwestern suburbs of the city, this tiny restaurant offers some
of the most ambitious cooking in greater Glasgow, using mostly
local and seasonal ingredients. See Chapter 12.
 Best Cafe: Cafe Gandolfi. Perhaps more of a bistro than cafe, Café
Gandolfi offers straightforward and delicious dishes, whether you
choose a bowl of Cullen skink (smoked haddock chowder) or a sir-
loin steak sandwich. See Chapter 12.
 Best Pub Food: Stravaigin. With an award-winning restaurant in 
the basement, the ground floor pub Stravaigin offers similarly top-
notch quality food — at a fraction of the restaurant price. See
Chapter 12.
 Best on a Budget: Wee Curry Shop. A brief stroll from the shop-
ping precincts of Sauchiehall Street, the Wee Curry Shop is a tiny
gem of a restaurant, serving freshly prepared Indian cuisine at bar-
gain prices. See Chapter 12.
The Best Rural Restaurants
 Andrew Fairlie at Gleneagles, Auchterarder, near Stirling: It may
be the finest dining experience in the country, and Fairlie is arguably
the most talented chef in Scotland at present. See Chapter 16.
 Applecross Inn, Applecross, the Western Highlands: The inn may
not be the easiest place in Scotland to reach, but many visitors
agree that the twists and turns of the road to Applecross are well
worth the journey for a meal here. See Chapter 18.
 Braidwoods, Dalry, North Ayrshire: One of the standout restau-
rants in Ayrshire and holder of a Michelin star and other accolades,
Braidwoods is expensive but worth the price. See Chapter 15.
 Creagan House, Strathyre, the Trossachs: Run by Cherry and
Gordon Gunn, the restaurant is part of a charming inn in a 17th-
century farm house. See Chapter 16.
 Seafood Cabin, Skipness, Argyll: I love this place on a sunny
summer day, when you can nosh on fresh seafood and shellfish on
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Scotland 13

the picnic benches with a view of a castle and isle of Arran. See
Chapter 15.
 Three Chimneys Restaurant, Colbost, Isle of Skye: Probably the
most popular restaurant on Skye, the Three Chimneys serves
superb Scottish cuisine paired with produce from Skye, its island
home. See Chapter 19.
The Best Castles
 Blair Castle, Blair, Perthshire: Blair’s chock-full o’ stuff: art, armor,
flags, stag horns, and more goodies not typically found on the stan-
dard furniture-and-portrait castle tour. See Chapter 17.
 Caerlaverock Castle, Dumfries and Galloway: Long a target of
English armies, Caerlaverock remains one of Scotland’s more clas-
sic Medieval castles. See Chapter 14.
 Castle Tioram, Blain, Ardnamurchan: This classic medieval fortress
now in ruins sits along the picturesque shores of Loch Moidart. 
You can enjoy some good hiking trails near the castle, too. See
Chapter 18.
 Cawdor Castle, Cawdor, the Highlands: Cawdor is one of my
favorites, largely because the room-by-room self-guided tour 
cards are well written and humorous. See Chapter 18.
 Doune Castle, near Stirling: Fans of the film Monty Python and the
Holy Grail may recognize Doune. Thanks to its limited restoration,
visitors get a good idea of what living here in the 14th century was
like. See Chapter 16.
 Duart Castle, Craignure, Isle of Mull: Duart was abandoned in 1751,
but thanks to the efforts of Fitzroy Maclean, it was restored from
ruins in 1911. Making your way up the narrow, twisting stairs is
worth it because you can walk outside on the parapet at the top 
of the castle. See Chapter 19.
 Eilean Donan, Dornie, the Highlands: This is probably the most
photographed stone pile in Scotland (after Edinburgh Castle, that
is). On an islet in Loch Duich, Eilean Donan is a quintessential
castle. See Chapter 18.
 Stirling Castle, Stirling: This castle was the residence of Mary
Queen of Scots, her son James VI of Scotland (and later James I of
England), and other Stuart monarchs. Recently restored, the Great
Hall stands out for miles thanks to the creamy, almost yellow ex-
terior that apparently replicates its original color. See Chapter 16.
 Threave Castle, Castle Douglas, Dumfries and Galloway: Threave is
a massive 14th-century tower house on an island in the middle of
the River Dee (a boatman ferries visitors across). See Chapter 14.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
14

The Best Cathedrals, Churches, and Abbeys
 Dunfermline Abbey and Palace, Dunfermline, Fife: This abbey is
on the site of a Celtic church and an 11th-century house of worship
dedicated to the Holy Trinity; traces of this history are visible
beneath gratings in the floor of the old nave. See Chapter 16.
 Glasgow Cathedral, Glasgow: This cathedral is also known as the
cathedral of St. Kentigern or St. Mungo’s, and it dates to the 13th
century. The edifice is mainland Scotland’s only complete medieval
cathedral. See Chapter 12.
 High Kirk of St. Giles, Edinburgh: Just a brief walk downhill from
Edinburgh Castle, this church — and its steeple, in particular — is
one of the most important architectural landmarks along the Royal
Mile. See Chapter 11.
 Iona Abbey and Nunnery, Iona, the Hebrides: This spiritual land-
mark is a significant shrine to the earliest days of Christianity in
Scotland. See Chapter 19.
 Jedburgh Abbey, Jedburgh, the Borders: This abbey is one of four
Borders abbeys commissioned by Scots King David I in the 12th
century. See Chapter 14.
 Melrose Abbey, Melrose, the Borders: The heart of Scots King
Robert the Bruce is rumored to be buried somewhere on the
grounds of this abbey, which sits amidst somewhat spectacular
ruins. See Chapter 14.
 St. Vincent Street Church, Glasgow: This church offers limited
access to visitors, but it’s the most visible landmark attributed 
to the city’s great architect, Alexander “Greek” Thomson. See
Chapter 12.
The Best Art Galleries
 The Burrell Collection, Glasgow: This gallery houses the treasures
left to Glasgow by Sir William Burrell, a wealthy ship owner and
industrialist who had a lifelong passion for art. He started collect-
ing at age 14 and only ceased when he died at the age of 96 in 1958.
See Chapter 12.
 Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA), Glasgow: This gallery is housed 
in the former Royal Exchange. The permanent collection has works
by Stanley Spencer and John Bellany as well as art from the “new
Glasgow boys.” See Chapter 12.
 Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow: The Hunterian holds the artistic
estate of James McNeill Whistler, with some 60 of his paintings as
well as some by the Scottish Colourists. It also boasts a collection of
Charles Rennie Mackintosh–designed furnishings. See Chapter 12.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Scotland 15

 Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow: This is the
remarkable flagship of the city’s well-regarded municipal art collec-
tion, housed in the recently restored masterpiece of Victorian
architecture. See Chapter 12.
 Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery, Kirkcaldy, Fife: I have a partic-
ular soft spot for this modest provincial gallery and museum
because I think it has one of the single best collections of Scottish
Colourist paintings and other Scottish works from the 19th and
20th centuries. See Chapter 16.
 National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh: The National Gallery
offers a collection that has been chosen with great care and
expanded by bequests, gifts, loans, and purchases. See Chapter 11.
 Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh: This gallery
houses Scotland’s national collection of 20th-century art in a con-
verted 1828 school set on 4.8 hectares (12 acres) of grounds. See
Chapter 11.
 Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh: Designed by
Rowand Anderson, the gallery gives you a chance to stand 
before the faces of many famous people from Scottish history. 
See Chapter 11.
The Best Museums and Historic Attractions
 Bannockburn, near Stirling: Bannockburn is believed to be the
famous battlefield site where King Robert the Bruce’s soldiers van-
quished the English troops of Edward II. The heritage center offers
an excellent audiovisual presentation of the site’s unique history.
See Chapter 16.
 Burns Cottage and Museum, Alloway, Ayrshire: This attraction may
be basic, but it remains a must-see for even casual fans of Scots
poet Robert Burns. See Chapter 15.
 Calanais Standing Stones, Lewis, the Hebrides: This ancient cross-
shaped formation of large stones is best known as the “Scottish
Stonehenge.” See Chapter 19.
 Calton Hill, Edinburgh: This landmark mound of rock and earth
rises about 105m (350 ft.) above the city and is crowned with mon-
uments. It’s mainly responsible for Edinburgh’s being called the
“Athens of the North.” See Chapter 11.
 Culloden Moor Battlefield, near Inverness, the Highlands: This bat-
tlefield is where the hopes of Bonnie Prince Charlie’s Jacobite
uprising of 1745 (begun at Glenfinnan) ended in complete defeat in
1746. See Chapter 18.
 Gladstone’s Land, Edinburgh: This 17th-century merchant’s house,
looking suitably weathered and aged, is decorated in period-style
Part I: Introducing Scotland

furnishings, features colorful paintings of flowers and fruit, and has
a sensitively restored timber ceiling. See Chapter 11.
 Glasgow School of Art, Glasgow: This building was designed by
Scotland’s great architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, whose global
reputation rests in large part on this magnificent building on
Garnethill above Sauchiehall Street. See Chapter 12.
 Glenfinnan Monument, Glenfinnan, the Highlands: This monument
marks the hopeful start of the 1745 Jacobite rebellion, led by
Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was trying to reclaim the English and
Scottish crowns for his Stuart family lineage. See Chapter 18.
 Kilmartin House Museum, Kilmartin: This museum traces Scot-
land’s earliest civilizations, history, and culture. See Chapter 15.
 Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh: A most impressive modern sand-
stone building not far from the Royal Mile, the museum is home to
exhibits that follow the story of Scotland, including archaeology,
technology, and science, the decorative arts, royalty, and geology.
See Chapter 11.
 The Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh: The palace was built in
the 16th century adjacent to an Augustinian abbey that David I
established in the 12th century. Today, the royal family stays here
whenever they visit Edinburgh. When they’re not in residence,
which is most of the time, the palace is open to visitors. See
Chapter 11.
 Skara Brae, Orkney: This is the best-preserved prehistoric beach-
side village in northern Europe. For an idea of what you’ll see here,
think Pompeii-meets-the-Neolithic. See Chapter 20.
The Best Historic Houses and Gardens
 Abbotsford, near Galashiels, the Borders: Abbotsford is the man-
sion that Scotland’s best known novelist Sir Walter Scott built and
lived in from 1817 until his death. You can visit extensive gardens
and grounds on the property, plus the private chapel added after
Scott’s death. See Chapter 14.
 Culzean Castle, South Ayrshire: This castle overlooking the Firth of
Clyde is a fine example of Robert Adam’s “castellated” style (built
with turrets and ramparts). It replaced an earlier castle kept as the
family seat of the powerful Kennedy clan. See Chapter 15.
 Hill House, Helensburgh, West Dumbartonshire: The design of this
house was inspired by Scottish Baronial style, but it’s still pure
Charles Rennie Mackintosh, from the asymmetrical juxtaposition of
windows and clean lines that blend sharp geometry and gentle
curves to the sumptuous but uncluttered interior. See Chapter 13.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Scotland 17

 Holmwood House, Glasgow: This 1858 villa designed by Alexander
“Greek” Thomson is probably the best example of his innovative
style as applied to stately Victorian homes. See Chapter 12.
 Inverewe Garden, Poolewe: On the south-facing shores of Loch
Ewe, Inverewe has the most impressive collection of plants, set out
in its sprawling garden, in the Highlands. See Chapter 18.
 Little Sparta, Dunsyre: This garden was devised by one of Scotland’s
most intriguing artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, Ian Hamilton
Finlay. See Chapter 14.
 Logan Botanic Garden, Port Logan: This garden has palms, tree
ferns, and other exotic plants that you wouldn’t expect to see in
Scotland, such as towering flowering columns of echium pininanas
native to the Canary Islands. See Chapter 14.
 Mount Stuart, Isle of Bute: This mansion belongs to the Marquess
of Bute’s family, but it’s open to the public for much of the year. See
Chapter 15.
 Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh: Royal Botanic, with its acres of
land to explore, is one of the grandest gardens in all of Great
Britain, which is certainly saying something. See Chapter 11.
 Traquair House, Innerleithen: This house dates to the 10th century
and is perhaps Scotland’s most romantic house, rich in its associa-
tion with Mary Queen of Scots and the Jacobite uprisings. See
Chapter 14.
The Best Small Towns
 Culross: Thanks largely to the National Trust for Scotland, Culross,
in Fife, shows what a Scottish village from the 16th to 18th cen-
turies was like, with its cobbled streets lined by stout cottages fea-
turing crow-stepped gables. See Chapter 16.
 Dirleton: Midway between North Berwick and Gullane and east of
Edinburgh, Dirleton is cited by many as the prettiest village in
Scotland. It’s picture-postcard perfect, not like a real town at all,
but rather one that appears to have been created for a movie set.
See Chapter 13.
 Kirkcudbright: On the southern coast of the Scottish mainland,
near the Solway Firth, this quaint village of charming cottages,
many with colorful pastel paint jobs, was once a leading artists’
colony. See Chapter 14.
 Plockton: Located not far from Eilean Donan castle, Plockton is
probably the prettiest village in the Highlands. It sits on the shores
of Loch Carron and you’ll be amazed to find palm trees. See
Chapter 18.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
18

 Portpatrick: A small holiday resort on the Rhinns of Galloway,
Portpatrick is most certainly one of the most picturesque towns in
southwest Scotland. See Chapter 14.
 Ullapool: This town is the busiest fishing port in the northwest of
Scotland, and it’s also a popular resort — the last outpost before
the sparsely populated north. See Chapter 18.
The Best Distilleries
 Edradour Distillery, Pitlochry, Perthshire: Visitors get a good
primer on the whisky-making process at this mini-distillery. See
Chapter 17.
 Glenfiddich Distillery, Dufftown, the Northeast: In contrast to
Edradour, this is one of Scotland’s largest whisky factories, set
amid the rolling wooded hills of the famous Speyside region. See
Chapter 17.
 Laphroaig Distillery, Islay, Argyll: Islay, with more than a half-
dozen distilleries, is Scotland’s whisky island. Laphroaig has a dis-
tinctive peaty flavor with a whiff of sea air (some say they can even
taste a little seaweed). See Chapter 15.
The Best Golf Courses
 Muirfield Golf Course, Gullane, East Lothian: Muirfield is ranked
among the world’s great golf courses. It’s the home course of the
Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers — the world’s oldest
club. See Chapter 13.
 Royal Troon, South Ayrshire: The city and its environs offer sev-
eral sandy links courses, most prominently the Royal Troon Golf
Club. But try the municipal courses for a bargain round as well. See
Chapter 15.
 St. Andrews, Fife: Surely Scotland’s most famous golf mecca, St.
Andrews offers five 18-hole courses as well as one 9-hole course for
beginners and children, all owned by a trust and open to the
public. See Chapter 16.
 Turnberry Hotel Golf Courses, South Ayrshire: Like the Royal
Troon, Turnberry has been the scene of Open tournaments and
other professional golfing events over the years. Guests of the
Westin Turnberry hotel get priority here. See Chapter 15.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Scotland 19

The Best Pubs and Bars
 Café Royal Circle Bar, Edinburgh: This New Town pub stands out
as a longtime favorite, boasting lots of atmosphere and Victorian
trappings. It attracts a sea of drinkers, with locals as well as visi-
tors. See Chapter 11.
 Claichaig Inn, Glencoe, the Highlands: This hotel has a rustic pub
with a wood-burning stove, although it’s really the staff’s sunny dis-
positions that warm the woody lounge and bar. Claichaig Inn is
especially popular with hikers. See Chapter 18.
 Drover’s Inn, Inverarnan, Loch Lomond: This hotel has an atmos-
pheric pub with an open fire burning, barmen in kilts, and plenty of
travelers by foot and car nursing their drinks at the north end of
Loch Lomond. See Chapter 16.
 The Horse Shoe, Glasgow: With its long, horseshoe-shaped bar and
central location, this pub is a throwback to the days of so-called
Palace Pubs in Scotland. See Chapter 12.
 Mishnish, Tobermory, Isle of Mull: This pub on the Isle of Mull is a
rather big quayside bar for such a diminutive town. See Chapter 19.
 The Pot Still, Glasgow: This pub gets the nod because of its selec-
tion of single malts that numbers easily into the hundreds. See
Chapter 12.
 Prince of Wales, Aberdeen: With the longest bar in town and a con-
vivial atmosphere, this pub is possibly the best place to grab a pint
in Aberdeen. See Chapter 17.
 The Shore, Edinburgh: This pub in Leith fits seamlessly into its sea-
side port surroundings without resorting to a lot of the usual decora-
tions of cork and netting. It has excellent food, too. See Chapter 11.
 Whistlebinkies, Stirling: The name may make Whistlebinkies sound
like a place for kids, but adults will appreciate the comfortable
booths and selection of good beers and whiskies. The building
dates to 1595 and originally housed Stirling Castle’s blacksmith. See
Chapter 16.

n this chapter, I give you a concise bit of history to elevate your
knowledge of a country whose national origins are among the oldest
in Europe. I also show you how to tackle the language. Yes, it’s English
but not the same English you’re used to. I also cover the basics of
Scottish food, which is often as misunderstood as the natives’ accents.

Scotland 101: The Main Events
Geographically, Scotland is tiny compared to the United States or
Australia and small by most European standards, too: The country occu-
pies the northern one-third of Great Britain, covering about 78,725 sq.
km (30,410 sq. miles), which is a bit bigger than the size of Massachusetts,
Vermont, and New Hampshire combined — or not quite the size of
Austria. It is about 440km (275 miles) long and 248km (154 miles) wide 
at its widest point. Few parts of Scotland are more than about 64km (40
miles) from the sea and Scotland has more than 750 islands, although
only about 10 percent of them are inhabited. Scotland’s population has
been about 5 million for the past 50 years, so while the country may be
small, neither is it very densely populated. A majority of its residents
live in the central area in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh, the coun-
try’s two largest cities, which have a combined population of just over 
1 million. 

The key to comprehending — and, in part, enjoying — Scotland is to
know at least a bit of the country’s long and sometimes complex history.
For much of its existence, Scotland had full (if disputed) autonomy from
England, its larger, more populous, and sometimes pushy neighbor to
the south. Although the Scottish and English crowns were joined (1603)
and the countries were unified into Great Britain (1707), they remain dis-
tinct nations.
Early history
Standing stones, brochs (circular stone towers), and burial chambers are
the best remaining signs of Scotland’s earliest residents, but little is
known about these first tribes that were living in parts of the country
hundreds, indeed thousands, of years before Romans arrived. When the
Romans invaded in about A.D. 82, much of the land was occupied by a
people they called the Picts (the Painted Ones). Despite some spectacu-
lar bloodletting, the Romans never really conquered the indigenous
people in Scotland, and the building of Hadrian’s Wall (well south of the
current border with England) effectively marked the northern limits of
Rome’s influence. Sometime before A.D. 500, however, the Irish Celtic
tribes, called (however confusingly) “Scots,” began to successfully colo-
nize the land, beginning with western coastal areas nearest Northern
Ireland, creating the kingdom Dalriada.
The Dark and Middle Ages
The Celtic Scots and the Picts were united around 843, while pressures
of invasion from the south and Scandinavia helped mold Scotland into a
relatively cohesive unit. Under Malcolm II (1005–1034), tribes who occu-
pied the southwest and southeast parts of the Scottish mainland were
merged with the Scots and the Picts.
However small, Scotland’s terrain is full of lochs (not lakes; see “Braving
the Burr: Scottish English” for more local terminology) and mountains,
and they divide the territory very effectively. It can take a long time to
cover a small distance on foot or even horseback. The country was often
preoccupied with the territorial battles of clan allegiances.

Is that a chip I spy?
Scots are often mistaken to be English by foreigners. Any visitors should avoid that
faux pas. Scotland’s union with England in 1707 effectively relegated Scotland to little
more than an administrative region within Great Britain. Even though Edinburgh —
called the Athens of the North — has long been an intellectual center and Glasgow
was the “Second City” of the British Empire, many written histories of “Britain” tend
to ignore developments in Scotland. Even worse, in some cases, Scotland is treated
with condescension, which, in part, explains why Scots sometimes act as if they have
terrible chips on their shoulders.

Some of Scotland’s most legendary heroes lived during the 13th century,
particularly William Wallace (1270–1305), who drove the English out of
Perth and Stirling. Later Robert the Bruce (1274–1329) beat English
forces at Bannockburn. Crowned at Scone in 1306, he decisively defeated
Edward II of England in 1314.
In 1320, after decades of war against English invaders and occupiers,
barons loyal to Scottish King Robert the Bruce put their names on a
letter to the Pope, the Declaration of Arbroath. The letter not only
clearly affirmed the country’s independence but also addressed notions
of freedom and liberty — abstract ideals that most nations didn’t con-
template for hundreds of years. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the royal
Stuart line was established, providing a succession of kings (and one
notable queen).
The Reformation
The passions of the Protestant Reformation arrived on an already 
turbulent Scottish scene in the 16th century. The main protagonist was
undoubtedly John Knox, a devoted disciple of the Geneva firebrand
John Calvin. Knox had a peculiar mixture of piety, conservatism, strict
morality, and intellectual independence that many see as a pronounced
feature of the Scottish character today.
Knox helped shape the democratic form of the Scottish Church: Primary
among his tenets were provisions for a self-governing congregation,
including schools. Thus, Knox effectively encouraged literacy.
Knox vehemently opposed the reign of one of Scotland’s most famous
(and tragic) monarchs: Mary Queen of Scots (1542–1587). When Mary
eventually took up her rule, she was a Roman Catholic Scot of French
upbringing trying to govern a land (about which she knew little) in the
throes of the Reformation.
Following some disastrous political and romantic alliances, Mary fled
Scotland to be imprisoned in England — her life eventually ended by the
executioner’s ax on orders of her cousin, Elizabeth I. Ironically, Mary’s
son — James VI of Scotland — succeeded the childless Elizabeth and
became king of England (James I) in 1603.
Union and the Jacobites
In the 17th century, Scotland’s sovereignty ebbed away as the Scottish
royalty spent most of their time in London. In 1689, the final Stuart
monarch, the staunchly Catholic James VII (and II of England) fled to
France, ending the rule of Scottish kings. In 1707, Scotland had little
choice but to merge with England in a constitutionally united Great
Britain. This union abolished the Scottish Parliament, and those loyal to
the Stuarts (known as the “Jacobites” from the Latin for James) could
only vainly attempt to restore the Stuart line of royalty. But despite
defeat in 1715, the Jacobites didn’t give up.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Scotland 23

Thirty years later, Charles Edward Stuart (the Young Pretender), better
known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, picked up the gauntlet. He was the
central figure in a 1745 revolt that nearly worked. Initially successful,
starting from the Highlands, Stuart and his supporters easily reached
Derby, only 125 miles from London. The British capital was reportedly 
in a panic. But Charlie and the Jacobites made an ill-conceived tactical
retreat to Scotland, where they were eventually crushed at the Battle of
Culloden, near Inverness.
The Scottish Enlightenment and economic growth
During the 18th century, rapid progress in the emerging industrial age
produced prominent Scots who made broad and sweeping contributions
to practically all fields of endeavor. The Scottish Enlightenment brought
forward important philosophers, such as David Hume and Adam Smith.
Many industrial inventions that altered the history of the developing
world — such as the steam engine — were either invented or perfected
by Scottish genius and industry.
Scotland’s union with England and Wales began to reap dividends, and
the Scottish economy underwent a radical transformation. As trade with
British overseas colonies increased, the port of Glasgow, in particular,
flourished. Its merchants grew rich on the tobacco trade with Virginia
and the Carolinas.

A few famous Scots
 Robert Burns (1759–1796): Scotland’s plowman poet, known in many languages
and countries
 Sir Alexander Fleming (1881–1955): Nobel Prize winner who discovered penicillin
 David Hume (1711–1776): Laid the foundation for intellectual and philosophical
pursuits using the concept of secular morality
 David Livingstone (1813–1873): Medical missionary and African explorer who
named Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River
 Flora Macdonald (1725–1790): Key person in rescuing Bonnie Prince Charlie from
British troops after his defeat at Culloden
 John Muir (1834–1914): Pioneering conservationist who discovered California’s
Yosemite Valley and founded the Sierra Club
 Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832): Romantic novelist and poet who occupies a position
of preeminence in English literature
 Adam Smith (1723–1790): Author of the book The Wealth of Nations, which under-
pins the modern science of economics

The infamous Highland Clearances (1750–1850) expelled small farmers,
or crofters, from their ancestral lands to make way for sheep grazing.
Similarly, people in the Scottish Lowlands were forcibly moved. Increased
industrialization and migration into urban centers changed the national
demographic forever, while a massive wave of emigration created a
global Scottish Diaspora.
Edinburgh’s New Town was begun in the mid-1700s and today is a World
Heritage Site recognized by the United Nations. Later, Victorian builders
turned Glasgow into a showcase of 19th-century architecture.
The 20th and 21st centuries
By the 1960s and 1970s, Scotland found that its industrial plants couldn’t
compete with the emerging industrial powerhouses of Asia and else-
where. A glimmer of light appeared on the Scottish economic horizon in
the 1970s: The discovery of North Sea oil lifted the British economy
considerably.
In 1997, under a newly elected Labour government in London, the Scottish
electorate voted on devolution — a fancy word for limited sovereignty.
The referendum passed, allowing Scotland to have its own legislature for
the first time since the 1707 union with England. The Scottish Parliament,
centered at Edinburgh, has limited taxing powers and can enact laws
regarding health, education, transportation, and public housing — but it
has no authority over matters of finance, defense, immigration, and for-
eign policy.
Taste of Scotland: Not just Haggis or Haddock 
For too many years, restaurants in Scotland were known for boiled
meats and watery, overcooked vegetables. But in the past 20 years or so,
independent restaurants have displayed significant improvements in
culinary Scotland, where the best ingredients that the country produces
have been married with other styles and influences.
Let’s begin with traditional Scottish cooking, which is hearty. Staples
include fish (such as haddock and often smoked), potatoes (called tat-
ties), turnips (called neeps), oatcakes, porridge oats, and local game
such as grouse or venison. And haggis, which remains Scotland’s
national dish — though it’s perhaps more symbolic than gustatory.
But modern Scottish cuisine is more diverse and innovative, borrowing
from French and even Far Eastern techniques, using local produce such
as scallops or lamb. One of Scotland’s best-known food exports is
Aberdeen Angus beef, but equally fine is free-range Scottish lamb,
known for its tender, tasty meat. Fish, in this land of seas, rivers, and
lochs, is a mainstay, from wild halibut to the herring that’s transformed
into the elegant kipper (see the sidebar “Culinary lingo”). Scottish
smoked salmon is, of course, a delicacy known around the globe.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Scotland 25

Scottish shellfish is world-class, whether oysters and crabs or lobsters
and their smaller or delicate relative, langoustines, which have become
a hit in posh Manhattan restaurants. Ranging from pheasant and grouse
to rabbit and venison, game also has a key spot in the Scottish natural
larder.

Argyll peninsulas.
 A.D. 90: Romans abandon the hope of conquering Scotland, retreating to England
and the relative safety of Hadrian’s Wall.
 400–600: Celtic Scots from Ireland bring Christianity and establish the Dalriadic
kingdom in Western Scotland.
 1270: William Wallace, key patriot in deflecting the forces of Edward I of England,
who wishes to conquer Scotland, is born.
 1306–1328: Robert the Bruce leads an open rebellion against English hegemony,
and England eventually recognizes Scotland’s sovereignty.

Elizabeth opens the first Scottish Parliament in almost 300 years.
 2004: The controversially expensive and much delayed Parliament building opens
in Edinburgh.

Scottish raspberries are among the finest in the world. You definitely
need to try some of Scotland’s excellent cheeses as well. One of the best
is Criffel, from the south of the country: a creamy and rich semi-soft
cheese made from the milk of Shorthorn cows that graze only in organic
pastures. Delicious.
At your hotel or B&B, one meal you’re sure to enjoy is a Scottish break-
fast or the full fry-up, as the locals may call it. Expect most or all of the
following: eggs, bacon and sausage, black pudding or haggis, grilled
tomatoes and mushrooms, fried bread or potato scones, toast, mar-
malade or jam, juice, and coffee or tea. A feast this size can often keep
you going right through the afternoon.
These days, the word “eclectic” describes Scotland’s metropolitan
restaurant scene, particularly in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Indian restau-
rants abound, as do French, Italian, and Thai options. In the rural areas,
the selection can be hit or miss, though stick to my recommendations
and you should do just fine. Scots today can eat better than ever before,
although much of population still seems to subsist on take-away fish and
chips or, as the locals prefer to call them, fish suppers.
Braving the Burr: Scottish English
Yes, English is spoken in Scotland, but between the local expressions,
heavy accents, and thick burr (trilling of the letter “r”), it can occasion-
ally sound like a foreign language. Don’t worry; at times even Scots from
one region don’t know what someone from another area is saying.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Scotland 27
Culinary lingo
Here are a few foods that you’re likely to come across in Scotland.
 black pudding: savory sausage of oats, blood, and spices
 bridie: meat and potato pie
 cullen skink: creamy smoked haddock chowder
 haggis: plump sausage of finely diced sheep offal (heart, liver, lungs, and so on),
oatmeal, and spices
 kippers: smoked herrings
 neep: turnip
 tattie: potato
 toastie: toasted sandwich

The standard joke about England and Scotland is “two countries divided
by a common language.” Differences of Scottish English include: r’s
being rolled, “ch” taking a hard throaty sound, and the “g” often being
dropped in words ending in “ing.”
Gaelic and Scots
In early history, the prevailing tongue across western and northern
Scotland was a Celtic language, Gaelic. Northumbrian English was intro-
duced from the south, and the language known as Lowland Scottish, or
Scots, then developed; Scots borrowed from Gaelic, Scandinavian
dialects, Dutch, and French.
After the royal court moved to England in 1603, Scottish people who
didn’t still speak Gaelic mostly spoke a vernacular English, the language
of their beloved Bible. Meanwhile, the Scots language was looked upon
as a rather awkward, coarse tongue. In the 18th century, English also
became the language of university instruction. By the end of the 20th
century, TV and radio had begun to even out some of the more pro-
nounced burrs and lilts of the Scottish accent. However, the dialect and
speech patterns of the people in Scotland remain rich.
Gaelic, while not widely spoken, is certainly far from dead — particularly
in places like the Western Isles, where at least 60 percent of the popula-
tion still speaks Gaelic. Even public-affairs TV in Scotland airs a few pro-
grams in the language (with subtitles for those of us completely befuddled
by Gaelic). 
In Glasgow, Glaswegians (which the residents are called) tend to be very
friendly toward tourists. There’s no need to feel intimidated by their
heavy accents and colorful local expressions. Be patient and ask those
you don’t understand to repeat themselves or to slow down. And if
someone says to you, “Hi, how ye dae’in?” Reply with, “I canna com-
plain.” You just may be mistaken for a local — for a minute, anyway.
To save you from having to maintain one of those polite but puzzled
smiles on your face while talking to locals, review this handy glossary of
some common words from both Gaelic and Scots as well as some stan-
dard British English substitutions for North American English.

Pub Life in Scotland
Much socializing in Scotland centers on the local pub. The pub’s more
than a watering hole. It can be the gathering place for an entire commu-
nity, the key place where the locals go to share news and exchange
gossip. At certain pubs, pickup sessions of traditional and folk music 
are common. 
Even if you’re not a big drinker, going out for a pint of lager, a dram of
whisky, or even just a bite to eat at a Scottish howff can be a memorable
part of your trip, since you’re almost guaranteed to meet real Scots.
Don’t tip the bar staff: You’ll immediately be sussed out as an outsider,
and it won’t get you a free round of drinks for your troubles, either. On
the issue of rounds, it’s quite common for individuals in groups to buy a
round during any session of drinking. You shouldn’t pass on your turn —
it’s considered bad manners.
Join ’em for a pint of beer
The most widely available, mass produced Scottish beers are Tennents
lager and McEwens ale, but from region to region, you may find a number
of local breweries, making anything from light-colored lagers to dark
ales. Among them, Deuchars IPA and Orkney’s Dark Island are standouts.
The most popular stout remains Guinness, from neighboring Ireland,
while the potent Stella Artois, from the Continent, is the best-selling pre-
mium lager.
Traditionally, the strength of Scottish ale (as distinct from lager) is
labeled by shillings (for example, Belhaven 80/-). The higher the number,
the stronger the beer. Today, with cask-conditioned ales, the bar can tell
you the alcohol content, ABV: four is standard, six is strong.
Remember, practically all beer in Scotland has higher alcohol content
than any sold in North America. And that even goes for familiar
American brands such as Budweiser. So, take it easy.

Whisky galore
If you’re in Scotland (or almost anywhere in Europe), you don’t need to
identify it as Scotch whisky. Most connoisseurs prefer varieties of single
malt Scotch, the taste of which depends largely on where it’s distilled:
sweet Lowland, peaty Island, or smooth and balanced Highland. Single
malts are seen as sipping whiskies and should never be served with ice
or diluted with any thing other than a few drops of tap water. If you want
a cocktail made with whisky, expect it to be a well-known blend, such as
Famous Grouse or Bell’s, and not single malt, such as Glemorangie or
Laphroaig. If you want a North American bourbon, rye, or sour-mash
whiskey, you need to name the brand: for example, Jack Daniels or
Makers Mark.
If you’re ordering whisky, simply ask for a “wee dram” and the bartender
may think you’ve been drinking in Scotland your whole life. Again, the
established way to drink the spirit is neat — that is, nothing added. But
some say a few drops of tap water bring out the aroma and flavor.
Other cocktail concoctions
If you order a mixed drink (such as a gin and tonic), don’t be surprised if
the barkeep hands you a glass with a little ice and the alcohol, and, to
the side, a small bottle of mixer. That’s just how it’s done. Also, the
expression “fresh orange” usually means bottled orange juice. Don’t ask
me why.
Tuning Your Ear to Scottish Music
Scottish music is considerably more than “Scotland the Brave” played
on bagpipes, although you may well hear that during your stay as well.
The Gaelic-influenced songs and sounds of the Hebridean Islands and
the Highlands have been around for centuries. The fiddle, accordion,
flute, and Celtic drum are all part of the musical tradition. The best

A bit of whisky terminology
Scotland’s home to a host of whisky experts, and in case you meet some, here are a
few helpful terms to keep in mind.
 dram: A shot of spirits (usually whisky), roughly 35 milliliters or about an ounce
 neat: Whisky served without ice or water
 nip: A whisky chaser to a pint of beer
 usige beatha (ooshka bay): Water of life; the Gaelic for the word whisky

chance to hear the real deal is at a jam session in a pub or at a more
formal (but still fun) social dance called a ceilidh (pronounced kay-lee).
Bagpipes and the rousing, indeed ear-shattering, sounds they can create
are entrenched in the national identity and culture of Scotland.
Every summer, Glasgow hosts an international piping competition that
draws thousands of pipers (many of whom also perform as part of
Edinburgh’s Military Tattoo, a show featuring music, marching, and mili-
tary exercises). But a lone piper may pop up anytime, anywhere. Once
on a misty late-summer’s day at the Highland Monument to Bonnie
Prince Charlie in Glenfinnan, one suddenly popped up on a nearby 
hillside and began playing. No kidding.
Visiting Golf’s Hallowed Ground
Golf may have originated in mainland Europe (or China, according to
some accounts), but Scotland at least gets the full credit for developing
the sport and codifying its rules. Golf has been played here for more
than 500 years. In places such as eastern Fife or North Ayrshire, you’re
as likely to see someone golfing around a park as you are to see kids
playing basketball in a Los Angeles playground.
If you need a caddy, don’t be surprised if he isn’t young — the average
age of a golf caddy here is about 50. Don’t expect courses to provide
motorized carts (although they’re popping up more and more). Finally,
please do not play a championship course if you’re a beginner or even an
intermediate. 
Visitors (men and women) can play on all public and most private-
members courses (Chapter 21 lists ten of the best). But at the exclusive
clubs, members receive priority for tee times. Many courses have dress
codes, so play it safe and wear a shirt with a collar as well as proper golf
shoes if you’re heading to the links.
Exploring Scotland’s Great Outdoors
Scotland has long had world-class fishing, while its sailing, hill-walking
and hiking are first rate, too. If you’re an angler, Scotland doesn’t require
a national license to fish. Instead, you buy permits locally at bait and
tackle shops or request permission from landowners. Local tourism
offices can provide you with more information.
The hiking in Scotland can take you through wooded glens, beach dunes,
or windswept mountains. 
If you’re walking in the Highlands, you must take all the precautions that
you would if you were climbing in much higher Alpine conditions. The
weather can change dramatically in a short period of time.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Scotland 31

As for the wildlife, in the right seasons, the marshes of Scotland teem
with migratory birds, the seas offer whale-watching, and the Highlands
boast eagle-nesting sights. This side of the tourism business is just
beginning to catch on, as is “Green Tourism.”
Background Check: Recommended 
Movies and Books
If you’re looking to find out more about Scotland than just what’s in this
book, you have a variety of films and books at your disposal. The follow-
ing sections list some suggestions.
Films
The ten films listed below are among the best and most popular made
about Scotland and its people.
 Braveheart (1995): This movie — hardly historically accurate but
moving nonetheless — probably did more to stir overseas interest
in Scotland than any promotional campaign ever cooked up by the
tourist board. Mel Gibson stars as the 13th-century patriot William
Wallace in this sweeping Academy Award–winning epic. 
 Gregory’s Girl (1981): A simple comedy about an awkward high
school student (played by gawky John Gordon-Sinclair) in a
modern (and mostly hideous) 20th-century New Town near
Glasgow. Quirky but loveable. 
 I Know Where I’m Going! (1945): This is a charming, funny WWII–
era black and white film from the great British team of Powell and
Pressburger. It takes a young English fiancée on a suspenseful,
romantic adventure to the Isle of Mull. 
 Local Hero (1983): In this sweetly eclectic comedy, villagers on a
gorgeous stretch of Scottish coastline (filmed near Mallaig) expect
to cash in big time because of Texan oil-industry interest. But
events conspire against greed.
 My Name is Joe (1998): Although not entirely lacking humor and
romance, this film paints a rather grim, if accurate, picture of
Glaswegians struggling with their addictions and inner demons.
 Orphans (1997): Actor Peter Mullan (star of My Name is Joe) wrote
and directed this outlandish and very, very dark comedy with lots
of foul language about the day the Flynn family in Glasgow tried to
bury their recently deceased mother. 
 The 39 Steps (1935): Director Alfred Hitchcock and scriptwriter
Charles Bennett almost completely reset John Buchan’s tale of
spies and intrigue. Instead of sticking to the Borders, the film trans-
ports the hero to the Highlands. Good idea.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
32

 Trainspotting (1996): Based one of the most popular contempo-
rary books by Scottish author Irvine Welsh, Trainspotting is the
gritty and often hilarious account of a group of unrepentant drug-
addled characters in Edinburgh in the 1980s.
 Whisky Galore! (1949): Retitled Tight Little Island in America, this
classic movie is based on a true story. The residents of a small
Scottish isle get an intoxicating windfall when a ship carrying
50,000 cases of whisky crashes off their coast during WWII. 
 The Wicker Man (1973): A cult classic of cinema about a strange
New Age community on a picturesque Scottish island — and the
secrets they keep from a mainland constable.
Books
There are too many books about Scotland to mention, so I’ve chosen to
highlight my favorites in three main categories: biography, fiction, and
history.
Biography
 Bonnie Prince Charlie by Fitzroy Maclean (Canongate, 1989) tells
the tale of one of the most romantic royal characters in Scottish
history.
 The Life of Robert Burns by Catherine Carswell (Canongate
Classics, 1998) is the groundbreaking look at the life of Scotland’s
national poet. First published in the 1930s, Carswell’s assessment
was so frank — particularly regarding the poet’s romantic and
sexual liaisons — that many took offense. 
 Robert Louis Stevenson: A Biography by Claire Harman (Harper-
Collins, 2005) follows the trail of the frail adventurer and world-
famous author, from his Edinburgh birthplace to Europe and finally
his last home in the South Pacific. 
 The Sound of Sleat: A Painter’s Life by Jon Schueler (Picador,
1999) is a remarkable autobiography by American–born abstract
impressionist Schueler, who found his muse in the land and espe-
cially the sky of Scotland. He even made a second home near the
Western Highland port of Mallaig.
Fiction
 The Heart of Midlothian by Sir Walter Scott (Penguin Classics)
was declared a masterpiece in 1818 and remains Scott’s seminal
piece of fiction, influencing the later works of authors such as
Balzac, Hawthorne, and Dickens.
 Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson (Penguin Classics) follows
the adventures of young David Balfour after he’s spirited out of
Edinburgh and ends up on the wrong side of the law in the Western
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Scotland 33

Highlands. The story is as entertaining today as it was upon publi-
cation in 1886.
 Lanark: A Life in Four Books by Alasdair Gray (Pub Group West,
2003) is perhaps the most important contemporary novel to be
published in Scotland in the last 100 years. Gray is an eccentric of
the first order, but this work of fiction (first published in 1981 and
illustrated by the author, too), despite some fantastical detours,
gets to the core of urban Scotland.
 The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by Muriel Spark (Perennial
Classics, 1999) and Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh (W. W. Norton &
Company, 1996) are both better known for their cinematic adapta-
tions, but in their own very different ways, both novels manage to
capture elements of Edinburgh life.
History
 Scotland: A New History by Michael Lynch (Pimlico, 1992) is a
good take on Scottish history from ancient times up to the 1990s.
 The Scottish Enlightenment: The Scot’s Invention of the Modern
World by American historian Arthur Herman (Crown, 2001) offers a
clear and extremely readable explanation of the impact that
Scottish thinkers had on the world.
 The Scottish Nation: 1700–2000 by academic Tom Devine (Penguin,
2001) is a good, recently published historical overview of Scotland.
Devine is one of the few historians to examine how people were
driven from the Scottish Lowlands, as well as more famous and
lamentable clearances from the Highlands.
 Stone Voices: The Search for Scotland by Neal Ascherson (Hill &
Wang, 2003) is a quest for the national character of Scotland. In a
series of anecdotes and reflections, journalist Ascherson helps
readers understand the worthy sentiments behind Scottish inde-
pendence and begins to redress the imbalance of Scottish histories
so often written by the English.

When to Go
In This Chapter

 Evaluating when to go, season by season
 Anticipating Scotland’s changeable weather
 Planning for festivals and events
T
he next time you meet people who’ve recently been to Scotland, ask
them what the place is like, and they may well give you a wistful, far-
away look. That’s because the region has the potential for magic. With
the vitality and culture of Edinburgh and Glasgow, the Highlands’ some-
times breathtakingly raw scenery, and some of the friendliest English-
speaking people in the world, Scotland is bound to leave fond memories.
From urban chic to ancient castles, from misty glens to craggy coast-
lines, Scotland is a dream (as well as dreamy) destination.
The success of a Scottish vacation can depend on where and when you
go, however. This chapter starts with a geographic breakdown of the
country, giving you a better idea of what the various regions have to
offer and how long you may want to stay in each spot — especially given
your particular interests and travel budget. Good planning ensures that
certain factors — short winter days, too many tourists, being stuck in
one place for too long, or not giving yourself enough time to see the big
attractions — don’t distract from a great trip.
This chapter also has advice and insight on when to travel — from
details about the weather to a calendar of events — so that you can
more easily determine the best way to spend your Scottish vacation.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
The first thing to understand about Scotland is this: It may be a small
country, but it’s one divided by mountains, rivers, and lochs, especially
up north. Most roads don’t travel in straight lines. So, although the

mileage may seem short, your travels across the country can — and
possibly will — take longer than expected. But slow down and enjoy 
the ride.
The country’s biggest topographical feature is the Highland. Its bound-
ary runs roughly diagonally across the country, from the southwest to
the northeast. If you draw a straight line, west to east (say from the Isle
of Mull to the River Tay), you will go from rocky islands and distinctive
mountain terrain to gentle moorland and rolling hills of the upper
Lowlands.
Finally, any division of Scotland is bound to be a bit arbitrary: There’s
often no clean line to divide one region from another, but I’ve done my
very best to present the regions accurately and logically. But sometimes
that means that my geographic breakdown of the country doesn’t exactly
match that done by the Scottish tourist board. For example, I put the Isle
of Mull with the other islands of the Hebrides (in Chapter 19), while the
Scottish Tourist Board lumps it into a broad region stretching across the
country. I will highlight where there are similar discrepancies and possi-
ble confusion.
For more information on the country’s cities and regions, check out Part
III, which discusses Scotland’s two major cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow;
Part IV has the lowdown on major regions in Scotland. The mainland
areas are introduced from south to north, starting with the Borders and
southwest regions and finishing with the Highlands. Finally come the
chapters on Scotland’s western and northern islands.
Edinburgh and Glasgow
Let’s face it: Many and, possibly, most visitors to Scotland never get any
farther than the country’s two principal cities. And that’s okay. They’re
excellent destinations in their own right, and from them travelers can
take side trips to experience Scotland’s other charms (see Chapter 13).
Although only a 50-minute train ride apart, Edinburgh (see Chapter 11)
and Glasgow (see Chapter 12) are exceptionally different but equally fas-
cinating and culturally rich. Think of them as the McCartney and Lennon
of Scotland, making their own unique contributions and creating a
dynamic duo.
Edinburgh (pronounced eddin-burra, with a short “e” as in “Edward”) is
the capital of Scotland. It has a historic Old Town as well as a so-called
New Town that is actually slightly older than the United States! As the
second most popular tourist destination in the U.K. (London’s the first),
Edinburgh and its charms are internationally recognized, as is the city’s
annual summer Festival. In addition, it boasts a striking cityscape — a
castle on a hill being just one of several noteworthy landmarks — as well
as the royal Palace of Holyroodhouse.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
36

Glasgow (pronounced glazz-go) is older than Edinburgh but appears
more modern these days. Traditionally viewed as a working-class indus-
trial metropolis, Glasgow thrived as the “Second City” of the British
Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries, and today it offers the best con-
centration of Victorian architecture in the U.K. After an economic decline
in the 20th century and a reputation (deserving or not) of crime, grime,
and gangsters, Glasgow emerged in the 1980s and 1990s as the cultural
hot spot of Scotland, boasting leading artists and best-selling indie rock
bands.
Southern Scotland
The southernmost regions of Scotland are 1) the Borders, aptly named
because it borders Northumberland in northern England, and 2) Dumfries
and Galloway, which stretch southwest along the Solway Firth (which
clearly divides England and Scotland) to the Mull of Galloway. These
regions certainly have their own allure and attractions, whether Abbots-
ford, the Sir Walter Scott’s mansion, or the Logan Botanic Gardens, with
its almost tropical plants. The town of Dumfries (dum-freece) was the
final home of the national poet Robert Burns, and around the village of
Melrose, the ruins of several ancient abbeys commissioned by King
David I in the 12th century can be found. If you have time for an extended
stay, both regions merit a day or two of exploring. Alternatively, they can
be side-trips from either Edinburgh or Glasgow. (See Chapter 14 for more
information on both the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway.)
Ayrshire and Argyll
Ayrshire (air-shyer) is the long and primarily coastal region southwest
of Glasgow, best known for “Burns Country,” where most of the land-
marks and attractions associated with the great plowman poet are
located. But Ayrshire is also home to some of the best links-style golf
courses in Scotland and perhaps the world. Argyll (ar-guile) encom-
passes the central West Coast of Scotland, its remote peninsulas, and
the southernmost islands, such as Gigha or Islay, where much of the
country’s famous whisky is made. This is the heart of the ancient
Kingdom of Dalriada, where the first Celtic people settled in the 5th cen-
tury and also a region where Norse colonies were established until the
13th century. 
If you have time, the scenic Kintyre Peninsula and the isle of Arran
(sometimes described as Scotland in miniature) can be worth including,
as well as the port of Oban (oh-bin), the gateway to the Hebrides, and
Inveraray on the shores of Loch Fyne. But even if you don’t have time 
to explore the region fully, you would be remiss to skip places such as
Culzean Castle, which is close enough to make a good day trip from
Glasgow. (See Chapter 15 for more information on both Ayrshire and
Argyll.)
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 37

Fife and the Trossachs
North of Edinburgh, across the Firth of Forth, is the ancient Kingdom of
Fife; moving west across the country takes in the historic city of Stirling
and the Trossach mountains — rather like the Highlands only smaller,
less dramatic, and more wooded. Fife is a reasonably compact area and
is perhaps best known for the town of St. Andrews. Golfers make the pil-
grimage here from all over the world, but it is also a pretty great little
east coast college town with Scotland’s first university (and third oldest
in the U.K.). Another golf mecca lies inland: the famous Gleneagles
resort with its first-class hotel and perhaps the best restaurant in
Scotland, Andrew Fairlie at Gleneagles.
History buffs will enjoy a visit to the town of Stirling, with its castle, Old
Town wall, and picturesque monument to William Wallace (of Braveheart
fame). The Trossachs are the old stomping grounds of the legendary
Rob Roy and provided the setting for Walter Scott’s romantic poetry.
Like some landmarks in Ayrshire, highlights of Fife, Stirling, and the
Trossachs — including Loch Lomond — can be covered in day trips
from Edinburgh and Glasgow. (All of this is discussed in more detail in
Chapter 16.)
Tayside and Northeast Scotland
North of Fife and east of the Highlands are the River Tay and the city of
Dundee. Farther north are the Grampian Mountains, Royal Deeside
(home of the monarchy’s retreat at Balmoral castle), and the now oil-
rich city of Aberdeen. I have put them all together in my chapter on
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
38
Glossary of place names
Picture this: You’re passing through a quaint Highland town with an even quainter
name, such as Altnacraig or Invercharan. Wonder what it means? Many towns incor-
porate Gaelic words for geographical and topographical features. Use this glossary to
mix and match parts of names to get closer to their meanings.
 alt: stream
 ben: mountain
 brae: hill
 craig: rock
 drum: ridge
 dun: hill fort
 eilean: island
 firth: estuary or long narrow bay
 glen: valley
 inver: river mouth
 loch: fresh-water lake or large
salt-water inlet
 mor: great
 ness: cape

Tayside and the Northeast. The region offers castles, whisky distilleries,
and handsome countryside. (For details on this area, flip to Chapter 17.)
The Highlands
The Scottish Highlands represent a huge and justifiable tourist draw.
For better or worse, however, the area’s best-known attraction is still a
mythical creature swimming in the waters of Loch Ness. Yes, the loch is
a big, dark, and brooding body of water. But it’s not the best thing about
the Highlands. You’re not likely to see any monster and may feel that the
place has elements of a tourist trap, so see it if you must, but then move
on. The unofficial capital of the Highlands, Inverness, although not par-
ticularly exciting, provides a good jumping off spot for exploring the
Black Isle or other parts of the Highlands nearby.
The craggy Western Highlands are perhaps the proverbial soul of
Scotland. Although steeped in proud lore and sad tragedy, from the
Jacobite uprising to the massacre of Glencoe, the scenery is what will
leave an indelible mark on your memory. The mountains are ancient and
rise from the sea with utter majesty; the beach sands on the “Road to
the Isles” west of Fort William near Mallaig are brilliantly white and
unspoiled. Villages such as Plockton look like picture postcards, set
near the sea in the shadow of nearby peaks. North of the port of
Ullapool, the country is beautifully desolate and sparsely populated,
and Cape Wrath feels like the end of the earth. (The Highlands are dis-
cussed at length in Chapter 18.)
The Hebridean Islands
If you have time to conquer part of the Highlands, you should also make
a point to visit at least one of the country’s many, many islands. The
Hebrides (pronounced heb-rid-eez) encircle the western and northwest-
ern coasts of Scotland. The archipelago includes a few large inhabited
islands and several smaller ones (see Chapter 19). The Isle of Skye is
the biggest, most accessible, and arguably the most scenic.
Worth the ferry trips — and possibly an overnight stay or two — are
other islands, such as Mull and its little sister Iona, an ancient landmark
of Celtic Christianity in Scotland. Feeling a little more adventurous?
Head to the wind-swept Outer Hebrides, such as Lewis or Uist. Day-
trippers may just go to Eigg from the tiny port village of Arisaig.
(Turn to Chapter 19 for more details on the Hebrides.)
Shetland and Orkney islands
The far northern island chains of Shetland and Orkney are remote and
rural. Unless you have the time and inclination, they may not be worth
the trouble to visit. On the other hand, they feature some unparalleled
archeological sites dating to prehistory, while their very remoteness
makes them a welcome reprieve from the more trodden tourist trail.
(They’re discussed briefly in Chapter 20.)
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 39

Scheduling Your Time
Many visitors are tempted to try and see everything — especially the
curious and ambitious ones. But in the frantic effort to “do it all,” they
can miss as much as they see. Plus, they’ll just be exhausted at the end
of it all.
This book covers most of the country and gives you itineraries that take
you from one side of Scotland to the other and back again. But if your
time is limited, you should consider simply staying in Edinburgh and
Glasgow, which have plenty to offer, and using them as bases for any
excursions. Chapter 13 and the first chapters of Part IV are full of attrac-
tions within striking distance of the region’s two biggest cities.
Of course, the Highlands are spectacular. But if you don’t fancy the idea
of sleeping in a different bed every night, find a location that offers a
variety of sights to see and things to do in the vicinity of other places
you want to visit. For example, from the pretty seaside village of Arisaig,
you can easily get to Skye, see Glenfinnan and Fort William to the east,
or go south to Movern and Ardnamurchan. 
If you don’t see it all in one go, then you’ll just have to plan a return 
trip — or use this book to vicariously experience the bits you missed.
Mild weather thanks to the Gulf Stream
No matter what time of year you choose to visit Scotland, chances are
slim that you’ll make it back home without some Scottish raindrops
falling on your head. Always have a waterproof coat handy.
Certain places in Scotland get more rain than others. For example, the Isle
of Mull in the west is notoriously prone to precipitation, while the Moray
coast in the northeast is probably the most consistently sunny spot.

Not quite ready for prime time
This book doesn’t cover every part of Scotland. The northernmost areas of the main-
land, and towns such as Tongue, Wick, and Scrabster, aren’t addressed at all. My apolo-
gies for that, especially to any surfers among the readership: The north coast is a mecca
for those seeking new breakers. Most of the Scottish islands are uninhabited, and only
60 are larger than about 3 square miles. I don’t have space to deal with isles such as
Jura or Tiree in any detail. Sorry. I’ve also kept the chapter on Shetland and Orkney con-
cise, and don’t go into too many specifics about Aberdeenshire and Moray. I intend no
offense but generally feel that these are destinations for long-term visitors — or for trav-
elers with specific interests. If you want to visit an uninhabited island or spend time in a
location not adequately dealt with in Scotland For Dummies, please visit a tourist infor-
mation center.

As far as temperature goes, Scotland is reasonably cool year-round (see
Table 3-1). However, climate change is causing average temperatures to
rise. While a few summer weeks can see temperatures rise above 80°F, it
is usually in the 60s°F. In the colder months, there is not much risk of
getting frostbite, except on mountaintops and during occasional cold
snaps.

Here comes the sun
The amount of daylight varies greatly in Scotland’s northern latitudes.
The price paid for long, languid days during the summer is short, dark
ones during winter. If you depend upon natural light to see the sights
that you’re most interested in, visiting from May through September
allows you to take advantage of the longer days.
Before you leave home, get up-to-date weather forecasts on the Internet.
The Web site www.meto.gov.uk/weather/europe/uk/swscotland.
html — run by the U.K. Meteorological Office — is a good source for
Scottish weather forecasts and information.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
You’ve probably heard about Scottish weather. The Scots like to joke
about getting “four seasons in one day.” But weather isn’t the only con-
sideration to keep in mind when planning your trip to Scotland. The high
season brings crowds, and the low season carries the possibility of some
attractions and hotels being closed. No matter when you travel to
Scotland, however, each season boasts certain advantages and draw-
backs, which I share in this section.
Summer
The most popular and probably the best time to tour Scotland is summer,
when the country is geared to receive tourists and the weather’s usually
(though not always) warmer than other times of the year. For the unsure
traveler, traveling in the summer is your best bet; you have lots of com-
pany and plenty of leads to follow.
The upside
In the summer, all attractions, hotels, and restaurants — no matter 
how remote — are open for visitors and business. All tourist information
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 41

centers are open, too — some seven days a week and well into the
evening hours.
Summer’s the busiest tourist season, but crowds aren’t always a bad
thing. Streets teeming with people may actually enhance your trip.
Scotland’s a friendly place, so throwing a ton of visitors into the mix can
create a spirited atmosphere. Plus, the Edinburgh Festival in August is
quite possibly the biggest annual cultural event in all of Europe.
The days are long during this time of year. In fact, if you’re in the far
north, the sun never really appears to set. Even down in Edinburgh, sun-
light lasts well into the evening, and on the west coast, you can discern a
glimmer of fading light as late as 11 p.m. Of course, the sun rises about
4:30 in the morning, too.
The weather? Well, if you’ve got your heart set on fine and dry weather;
if you’re allergic (either physically or emotionally) to drizzle, fog, or rain;
or if it’s your tan you want to work on, then don’t go to Scotland. The
place is rarely balmy. Instead, summer conditions can be comfortably
warm and breezy during the day and drop to light-sweater temperature
at night. You may get caught in some rain, especially on the islands, in
June, July, or August.
The downside
During the summer, tourists can overwhelm many popular attractions
and towns. The influx of visitors, especially in Edinburgh from late July
to early September, may mean that hotels don’t have any available
rooms. Plus, normally quiet villages such as Pitlochry or Plockton start
to resemble Fifth Avenue, with crowds pouring off tour buses. If you’re
craving a break from the masses, summer may not be the time to come
to Scotland, unless you plan to travel to the country’s very extremities.
Seasonal rates are another downside to visiting in the summer:
Accommodations can be significantly more expensive in summer than in
other seasons.
For many travelers, the worst thing about summer in the Western
Highlands and islands are the midges — blood-sucking no-see-um bugs
that can drive you to serious distraction and leave a plethora of tiny but
extremely itchy bites on your body. Make sure you have netting and
some effective bug spray if you’re coming to these parts in the summer.
Summers on the western islands can be quite rainy because they take
the brunt of the prevailing trade winds. The best times to visit this
region are usually May or September, when dry periods are more preva-
lent, although it may be a tad cooler.
Fall
Fall, which Scots know only as autumn, is probably the most underrated
time to visit Scotland. The weather can be quite good, with a strong 
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
42

possibility of sunny, dry stretches. Even when it’s stormy, the weather
fronts often move through quickly. The prospect of mild days without
too much rain and daylight extending to at least 8 p.m. (until the clocks
go back) is great for marathon sightseeing.
The upside
Beginning in mid-September, the high season has run its course and
prices begin to fall. Everything is less crowded. The pubs and restau-
rants “belong” to the locals again as they reclaim their turf from the
tourist hordes. In autumn, you’re more likely to find bars filled with
locals rather than tourists.
Days are still reasonably long, and if you’re traveling in the West, the
midges usually get knocked back by the first cool nights (what a relief).
In rural areas, trees may begin to change color towards the end of fall,
and with the sun lower in the sky, the natural light can be magical.
The downside
A few of the more seasonal and far flung attractions, as well as some
tourist offices, start to shut down or at least restrict their hours in the
fall. Winterlike weather can set in quickly at the end of autumn.
Autumn may mean fewer tourists, but plenty of people still travel this
time of year. Autumn nights in Scotland can start to be surprisingly cool,
and some of the guesthouses don’t have central heating, so you may end
up buried in blankets or layering more clothes over your pajamas. In the
Highlands, you may even experience a light frost or snow flurry.
Winter
Conditions are less than ideal, but Scottish winters are quite a bit less
severe than you may assume. Anyone visiting from Iowa or Illinois will
find them quite mild, in fact. From November through March, the main
cities function as normal, and golf along the southwest coast remains a
lure. Days can be very short, however, and tourist attractions as well as
some inns in the countryside will be closed until springtime.
The upside
Prices are at their lowest all across the country in the winter, and you’re
likely to find the cheapest airfares of the year. Because it’s the least pop-
ular time to travel, more special rates and package deals are offered. 
The exceptions to winter travel deals are the weeks of Christmas and
New Year’s, when rates pop up to equal those of the high summer
season.
If you dislike crowds, winter’s the best time for you to visit Scotland. It’s
also a good time to visit museums, galleries, and year-round attractions.
And the landscape is almost as beautiful as during the full swing of
summer.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 43

For snowboarding and skiing, a few resorts offer adequate facilities in
the Highlands. If golf is your bag, then head for the links courses in
Ayrshire. They’re sandy and drain well, allowing play through the winter.
The downside
The winter weather can be driech (Scottish slang for gloomy and wet).
It’s predictably cold, rainy, and windy from January through March. The
temperature rarely dips to extreme lows and snowfalls aren’t as heavy
as they used to be, but blizzards can still hit. The sun usually doesn’t
rise until 9:30 a.m., and then it’s gone by 4 p.m.
Attractions can be shuttered every winter, and lots of places have
shorter hours during the winter months. Many rural hotels, B&Bs, and
restaurants close for the season as well. This reduced activity is all
because tourism slows to a crawl. You still can find plenty of things to
do, but your tour will offer fewer highlights than the one you get in the
other seasons.
Spring
Spring can be slow to start in Scotland, and even in May, the weather
can still feel rather wintry at times. But the days quickly lengthen, and
some people consider this to be the ideal time to travel in Scotland.
The upside
Warmer temperatures and longer days combine to make for wonderful
springtime conditions for touring the countryside. The ground is car-
peted in spring greenery, and the plants are beginning their displays (the
rhododendrons, in particular, are breathtaking). Rain showers are often
isolated and last only part of the day.
By the time spring rolls around, tourist industry folks have had their
breaks and are ready to resume playing host. Country inns and travel
information offices reopen, but because the high season hasn’t hit yet,
crowds are manageable.
The downside
Scotland can remain pretty rainy from March through June, and a snow
flurry or two isn’t unusual in March or April. Nights remain cool even if
days are warming up, so packing for the weather can be a chore.
Easter traditionally marks the beginning of the high season, so prices
start to go up at that point. But these days, foreign visitors start flooding
in (especially to Edinburgh) before that magic date, so it looks as if the
tourist season is stretching beyond its normal boundaries.

Edinburgh Fringe, and it alone encompasses some 1,800 performances
in a cultural bonanza, drawing major talent — especially comics — from
around the world. As if that wasn’t enough, Edinburgh also hosts the

St. Andrew’s Day celebrates Scotland’s patron saint, and events sur-
rounding November 30th include exhibits, concerts, and fireworks —
particularly in St. Andrews, where there are weeklong celebrations, as
well as other locations. Some Scots would like to see St. Andrew’s Day be
as big a celebration as the Irish St. Patrick’s Day. End of November.
December
In Scotland, New Year’s Eve is called Hogmanay and events take place
across the country. But Edinburgh marks the holiday with a weeklong
extravaganza of events (many free), culminating with a December 31st
street party, rock concert, and fireworks display. Glasgow has celebra-
tions on Hogmanay that include outdoor concerts. For the scoop 
on Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, call % 0131-529-3914 or log on to www.

Chapter 4
Following an Itinerary: 
Five Fine Options
In This Chapter
 Following a one-week tour of Scotland’s principal cities
 Taking your time on a two-week tour of the country
 Finding places that should please the children
 Discovering Scotland’s great outdoors in the Highlands and Western Islands
H
owever willing we are to leave a few things to chance, most of us
want to have a bit of structure when we travel. With that in mind,
this chapter suggests a clutch of practical itineraries. The first two are
appropriate if you have one or two weeks to explore Scotland. Then I
suggest a seven-day route designed particularly for traveling families.
Finally, if you want to focus on the outdoors, I’ve put together a pair of
different one-week itineraries that focus on the wonderful Highlands and
Scottish islands. These are just some suggestions, and alas they leave
out a few areas, such as the Kintyre peninsula or the Isle of Islay, which
you might think deserve a visit.
In each itinerary, I direct you to the proper chapters to find in-depth
information on the sights and attractions listed. Alternatively, you can
look up specific attractions in the Index at the back of the book, which
directs you to the appropriate city and region chapters in Parts III and IV.
You may be planning to rent a car for your stay in Scotland. If you want
to see just Edinburgh and Glasgow, however, you’re probably better off
without one. 
You may find that some side trips are more difficult to make without an
automobile, but regions such as Fife and Ayrshire (and cities such as
Stirling) can be visited by train or by bus. Even the shores of Loch
Lomond can be reached by train, so don’t feel obliged to use a smog-
spewing gas guzzler unless you need the utter freedom to explore and
take all sorts of back roads.

Seeing Many Highlights in One Week
If you have seven days to explore, you’re not going to see everything
that Scotland has to offer. Worry not: With a bit of enterprise, you can
see quite a lot despite the time restrictions of your vacation.
With only a week to spend, I strongly suggest that you principally visit
Edinburgh and Glasgow, using them as bases for excursions into the
countryside. The one-week itinerary in this section offers the option of
one overnight stay on the fringes of the Highlands or south of the princi-
pal cities. You may prefer to try and cover more of the country by stay-
ing in different places every night. If that’s the case, then you may want
to combine part of this section with parts of the next section on a two-
week trip in Scotland.
Day 1
Start in the capital, Edinburgh. In your inaugural 24 hours, familiarize
yourself with the city by taking one of the hop-on hop-off, open-top 
tour buses. Then stick to the city’s Old Town and stroll the Royal Mile,
taking in the attractions, such as Edinburgh Castle, Gladstone’s Land,
St. Giles Cathedral, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Later pop into a
pub for a drink and dine at one of the city’s fine restaurants. You can
find complete information on Old Town and its major attractions, pubs,
and restaurants in Chapter 11.
Day 2
Your priority today is Edinburgh’s museums and galleries. If you’re a his-
tory buff, the Museum of Scotland should top your list. For art, hit as
many national galleries as possible, whether the main collection on the
Mound, more recent works at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern
Art, or luminaries depicted in the National Portrait Gallery. For details
on all these (and more), see Chapter 11.
Day 3
Take your first day trip outside the city today. I offer three choices here
not because I can’t make up my mind, but because I want you to know
your options. Pick between the Kingdom of Fife, which is just across 
the Forth River from Edinburgh (see Chapter 16); the ancient city and
castle of Stirling (see Chapter 16); or East Lothian and the Borders (see
Chapters 13 and 14). Each choice provides a break from the city and
exposes you to the readily available countryside.
Day 4
It’s a travel day, but you’re only going some 45 miles west to Scotland’s
biggest city, Glasgow. As in Edinburgh, I advise one of the hop-on hop-off
tour bus rides that leave frequently from George Square in the heart of
the city. Return to the commercial center after your tour and explore
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
52

some of the city’s free museums, visit the medieval Glasgow Cathedral,
or follow my walking tour (in Chapter 12) to admire the famous Victorian
architecture or the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Flip to Chapter
12 for more information on Glasgow, including hints on the city’s top
pubs and restaurants.
Day 5
Return to explore the leafy environs of Glasgow’s most desirable district,
the West End, which is home to the city’s 500-plus year-old university
and an excellent municipal art collection in the recently refurbished
Kelvingrove Art Museum and Gallery. Shop, drink, and dine on the
West End’s main street: Byres Road. Another of today’s art-influenced
priorities is the Burrell Collection, which requires a trip to the Pollok
Country Park on the city’s south side. You can find more information on
all Glasgow has to offer in Chapter 12, where you can also take note of
my suggested one-, two-, and three-day or more itineraries for Glasgow.
Day 6
Time is running short, so why not make another day trip, with the
option of an overnight stay? Go west to Wemyss Bay and take the ferry
to the Isle of Bute to get a taste of island life. Or perhaps head towards
the Highlands, stopping along the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond. You
can make it back to Glasgow, but you may prefer to stay in the country
this evening. See Chapters 15 or 16 for details.
Day 7
Unbelievably, your time is almost up. You may want to go south of
Glasgow to Burns Country in Ayrshire, an excursion that can include
visits to the poet’s birthplace as well as stops at golfing hotspots, such
as Turnberry, and a tour of historic properties such as Culzean Castle,
with its magnificent seaside prospect, gardens, and parkland. (See
Chapter 15 for more information on these and other attractions in the
area.) If you passed on Stirling earlier in your visit, you can get there just
as easily from Glasgow. Chapter 16 has all the details.
Touring the Best of Scotland in Two Weeks
In two weeks, you can see all the major regions of Scotland and a fair
number of the major attractions, too.
Days 1, 2, and 3
Obviously, I don’t want to exclude Edinburgh and Glasgow from this itin-
erary, so you can spend your first two days in Edinburgh, following the
itinerary outlined in the previous section. But give the capital an extra
24 hours so that, on the third day, you can pick up some additional qual-
ity time in this fabulous city or take an additional day trip as outlined
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Fine Options 53

above. (After a detour south, this itinerary takes you to Glasgow, too, on
Days 6 and 7.)
Day 4
Now’s your chance to see some of Southern Scotland. Head for Melrose
and its historic abbey and see Abbotsford, the home of Sir Walter Scott.
Then, journey west to Dumfries and Galloway. Dumfries is a pleasant
southern town, sometimes referred to as the “Queen of the South,” with
poet Robert Burns’s final home, which is now a museum. If you have the
inclination, head to the lovely harbor town of Portpatrick on the Rhinns
of Galloway, a picturesque coastal settlement boasting a natural harbor
with excellent seaside views. See Chapter 14.
Day 5
Travel north toward Glasgow, stopping to take in Culzean Castle and
Burns Country, which are outlined in Day 7 of “Seeing Many Highlights 
in One Week.”
Days 6 and 7
These are your days to spend in Glasgow. Just follow my earlier sugges-
tions for what to see and do in “Seeing Many Highlights in One Week.” 
Day 8
Head north of the city toward the Highlands, via Loch Lomond.
Depending on your ambitions, this journey can include a detour to 
Loch Fyne and Loch Awe, but I suggest it’s probably best to head for
Oban (see Chapter 15) and then on to Mull.
Day 9
Spend today touring the isles of Mull and the ancient Christian settle-
ment of Iona. To get to these places, catch the ferry from Oban or join a
guided tour. If you want to spend the night, you may wish to consider
the wee, historic Isle of Iona or some place in Tobermory. See Chapter
19 for more information on the islands.
Day 10
From the port of Tobermory you can take a ferry (in season) to the
remote peninsula of Ardnamurchan. Along the way, you can stop to take
in Castle Tioram, Arisaig, Sands of Morar, and Mallaig. From Mallaig,
another ferry departs to the Isle of Skye. The ferry will also take you 
to the mainland where you can travel north and link up with the “Road
to the Isles.” See Chapters 18 and 19 for details on these areas and
attractions.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
54

Day 11
As you near the end of your tour, visit the Cuillin Hills of Skye and stop
at Portree before heading back to the mainland via the bridge at the
Kyle of Lochalsh. If you’re making good time, stop at Eilean Donan
castle and the picturesque town of Plockton before you start the long
but lovely drive to Inverness and the northern shores of Loch Ness. For
details on the area, flip to Chapters 18 and 19.
Day 12
Here’s your chance to see Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster. Don’t spend
too much time at Loch Ness, however, because you need to get across
the mountains to Royal Deeside. Here, it’s worth your time to have a
gander at a few castles, such as Braemar or Blair Atholl, and perhaps
make a stop at a whisky distillery. See Chapter 17 for more on the area.
Day 13
As you head back toward the center of Scotland, take in Perth as well as
the golfing mecca and ancient settlement of St. Andrews (see Chapter 16).
Day 14
On the last day of your tour, visit Stirling if you haven’t already done so,
or alternatively, tour Fife on your way back to Edinburgh, where this itin-
erary began a fortnight ago.
Discovering Scotland with Kids
Touring history-heavy castles or art-laden museums with children in tow
doesn’t have to be a big headache or a battle of patience and wills. Plenty
of attractions appeal to all ages. If you’re traveling with little ones, fol-
lowing the loose itinerary in this section can be the path of least resist-
ance. When you’re following this tour through Edinburgh and Glasgow,
you don’t need a car; public transportation and an occasional taxi
should suffice. However, upon leaving those two cities, a car becomes
necessary to complete this tour.
As you follow the cross-references in this section and jump to other
chapters in this book, look for the Kid Friendly icon, which points out
the best attractions, restaurants, and so on to visit with children.
Begin in Edinburgh, and make sure to visit Edinburgh Castle. The self-
guided audio tour may confuse little kids, but the castle is interesting
and fun to explore even without any commentary. Nearby, the Camera
Obscura usually fascinates children. You can make a trip to the Edin-
burgh Zoo to see the penguin parade, and while in town, visit the toy-
filled Museum of Childhood. See Chapter 11 for more information on
Edinburgh’s attractions.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Fine Options 55

Next it’s on to Glasgow, where you can break up your other sightseeing
with kiddie favorites such as the aforementioned Kelvingrove Art Gallery
and Museum or the Museum of Transport; interactive exhibits at the
Science Centre; and the fun, hands-on People’s Palace. For a breath of
fresh air (and to burn off any excess energy), take a romp around
Glasgow Green.
A couple of side trips from Glasgow can take two entire days. You can
head south along the coast, where the kids can comb beaches, see the
cottage where poet Robert Burns was born, and romp about the adven-
ture playground at Culzean Castle. In the other direction is Stirling, with
a bit of history and education at Bannockburn, good exploring in
Stirling Castle, and some entertainment (and frights) in the tour of
Stirling’s Old Town Jail.
From Glasgow, you may want to head north through spectacular Glen
Coe and perhaps spend a day exploring the area around Fort William,
hiking or mountain biking around Ben Nevis, the highest peak in Great
Britain. Next comes the Loch Ness region, which is generally a load of
fun for children. Check out one of the Loch Ness exhibitions and one of
the sonar-scoping monster-hunting cruises.
On the road back to Edinburgh, you can stop at J.M. Barrie’s Birthplace
(he wrote Peter Pan) in Kirriemuir and visit Deep Sea World, just north
of Edinburgh in North Queensferry.
Touring Scotland’s Great Highlands
Scotland has no shortage of things to see, and most regions have their
own unique attractions. But among the best regions is the wild terrain of
the Highlands. Why not try to get all the way to the top of Scotland (and
the U.K., too, for that matter) and see some of the wide-open spaces? For
this seven-day itinerary (I didn’t break it down into exact days, so you
can adjust the plans as you like), you can take the train from anywhere
up to Inverness and rent a car there. For more details on the attractions
and for lists of accommodations and restaurants in this area, see
Chapter 18.
From Inverness, head north across the Black Isle, through Tain, and
across the Dornoch Firth. Make a brief stop to see the cathedral in
Dornoch, and then head up through Lairg to the northern shore.
At Tongue, you may want to stop to see the Highland cattle that roam
the beaches here, and then go west to Durness, a settlement that John
Lennon visited as a child (which is why a small monument stands in his
memory). One natural curiosity is Smoo Cave, although what’s really
spectacular is the craggy shoreline, which leads to remote Cape Wrath.
For some excellent crafts, visit Balnakeil — an artists’ colony that’s a
throwback to the 1960s if there ever was one.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
56

From Durness, you head south along more beautiful, unspoiled shoreline
towards Scourie. But before you get there, you really must detour out to
Blairmore, park the car, and hike into the most unspoiled beach in Great
Britain, at Sandwood Bay. You can also hike to Cape Wrath from Sand-
wood, if you’re ambitious.
To appreciate just how wild, beautiful, and unpopulated the Western
Highlands region of Scotland truly is, detour at Kylesku to the peninsula
with the stone monument known as the Old Man of Stoer or simply carry
on to the active fishing port of Ullapool. It’s hardly a big town, but it
seems like the height of civilization after you’ve spent time further
north.
Inverewe Garden is the next highlight, although your drive south pro-
vides ample opportunities to stop and sightsee, like at Gruinard Bay,
where you may just see some sea otters splashing in the surf.
The road south twists and turns past Gairloch, Loch Torridon, and the
road to Applecross (where the inn serves famously delicious meals)
before arriving in perhaps the most picturesque village in the Highlands:
Plockton. Kick back, relax, and toast your Highland excursion on your
final night of this tour.
Finally, drive to Loch Duich and see Eilean Donan, the most pho-
tographed castle in the Highlands. Then hit the road through Inver-
moriston to Loch Ness, where you can take a brief cruise and see if
Nessie raises her knurled head, before you return to Inverness.
Touring the Western Highlands and Islands
If you don’t want to cover the hundreds of miles necessary to get to
places such as Durness, Sandwood Bay, and Inverewe Garden, then the
itinerary in this section is the one for you. It’s less strenuous but still
brings you into the Highlands and includes a taste of the islands, too.
For more details on the places mentioned in this section, see Chapters
16, 18, and 19.
From Glasgow, where you should rent a car for this tour after you’ve
seen the city, head northwest along the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond,
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Fine Options 57
Beware of the midge
I love the western extremities of Scotland, but for many, the region is home to the nas-
tiest beast in the nation. The midge (pronounced midgy) is a tiny flying insect that
leaves a terrifically itchy bite. If you can’t resist the call of the west, arm yourself with
some effective bug spray.

stop for refreshment at the Drovers Inn, carry on to Crianlarich, and
enter the Highlands via the gorgeously desolate Rannoch Moor and ver-
dant Glen Coe.
The region south of Fort William is a great place to spend the night. You
can choose from inexpensive B&Bs as well as posher lodges, such as
Ballachulish House. In Fort William, satisfy your shopping urges, and
then get on the “Road to the Isles,” which takes you to the Glenfinnan
Monument at the tip of Loch Shiel.
Get off the beaten track and explore a bit of Moidart and Ardnamurchan,
which has the most westerly peninsula in the British mainland. Take
time to see Castle Tioram before backtracking to Lochailort and resum-
ing the trek north to Arisaig.
From Arisaig, with its pleasant little harbor, you can take a cruise to one
of the small islands, Eigg. The trip often includes some whale sightings.
Just past Arisaig, golfers may want to try the tricky (if short) Traigh
course, before everyone enjoys the lovely Sands of Morar.
Next on this tour is Mallaig and the ferry to Armadale on the Isle of
Skye, which is the largest island of the Hebrides. Just north of the ferry
terminal is the Clan Donald visitor center. You have time to visit the
center and drive up to Portree, Skye’s main port, before heading back to
the mainland via the bridge at the Kyle of Lochalsh.
From Skye, head back to the mainland, where area highlights include the
attractions of lovely Plockton on Loch Carron and Eilean Donan castle.
Take the scenic drive to Invergarry, where you may want to spend the
night at the Glengarry Castle Hotel.
On your final day, head back to Fort William, where you may have time
to explore the Ben Nevis region, before retracing your steps through
Glen Coe and Rannoch Moor. But this time around, stop at the touristy
shops in Tyndrum for some souvenirs before hitting the shores of Loch
Lomond and the busy highway back to Glasgow.

It’s important to be realistic about the amount of time you’ll spend in the
car or bus burning up precious daylight hours. If you try to hit Ullapool
and Inverness in one full (and tiring) day, then you spend most of your
day driving the distance between the two cities and see only a few big
sights. Try to get up and out early — that means breakfast at 8:30 a.m.
instead of 11 a.m. And don’t try to cram too much into each day. If
you’re constantly rushing from one place to the next, then you won’t
enjoy anything you see.

Part II
Planning Your Trip 
to Scotland

In this part . . .
T
he chapters in Part II are designed to get down to the
nitty-gritty of planning your trip: I offer advice and guid-
ance on how much your trip to Scotland may cost and making
a sensible budget; ﬁnding out which airlines go where (and
ﬁnding the smartest value in airfares); deciding the best ways
to get around Scotland once you’re there; ﬁguring out how to
drive on Scotland’s roads; ﬁnding the right accommodations
for your needs; and managing passports. That’s not all.
In this part, you can ﬁnd advice on what to do if you get sick
in Scotland and whether you should invest in travel insur-
ance. If you’re a traveler with special needs and interests,
issues important to you are covered here, as well. In short,
the following pages are ﬁlled with all the info you need to plan
your trip to Scotland.

Chapter 5
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Creating a realistic budget for your trip to Scotland
 Reviewing money-saving tips
 Understanding the local currency and how best to get it
 Carrying money conveniently and safely
A
n important consideration for any vacation is your budget, of
course. How much will the trip cost and where will the money be
best spent? You don’t want to waste good money, but you probably
don’t want to be tied down to a bare-bones budget that restricts you
from seeing the highlights of Scotland.
The smartest way to travel is to plan your spending in advance: In large
part, this means understanding ahead of time what things will cost. But
keep in mind that sometimes you get what you pay for.
This chapter covers what you can expect to pay for transportation,
accommodation, dining, and sightseeing while in Scotland. Plus, I
include some money-saving tips. As a hands-on bonus, the Dummies
budget worksheet (Table 5-2) will help you to plot out your expenses.
Keep in mind that exchange rates are constantly fluctuating. And lately,
they’re bouncing around quite a lot. Because of this, it is impossible to
give you a precise conversion. 
First: Scotland, like the rest of the United Kingdom, doesn’t use the 
euro. Second: In general, the British pound sterling is worth somewhere
between 50 to 100 percent more than the U.S. dollar. Throughout this
book, I’ve calculated the exchange rate at one U.S. dollar being equal to
one British pound and eighty-five pence ($1=£1.85) — generally rounding
up. Third: If you want to be very conservative, essentially double all
pound amounts and that will give you a generous dollar equivalent.
Fourth (and finally): As the pound has been staying strong in compari-
son to the dollar (in other words, more dollars are now needed to buy
pounds), goods and services may well seem more expensive than what
you’re often used to at home.

Goods in Scotland often carry the same price in pounds as they would in
dollars back home. For example, a digital camera that costs $350 in New
York might be priced £350 in Edinburgh, too. But, of course, that means
it’s quite a bit more expensive in Scotland: at least $300 more costly
(using my conversion rate).
I suspect that you want to enjoy your stay and don’t want to be con-
stantly converting pounds to dollars before making every purchase. But
if your desire is to keep costs down, be wary and make sure you’re get-
ting a bargain or at least spending your money wisely.
By the way, all dollar references in this chapter are to the U.S. currency.
Planning Your Budget
As far as destinations go, Scotland is neither the cheapest nor the most
expensive place to visit. Can you do Scotland on $10 a day? No, quite
honestly — unless you sleep at the roadside and mainly eat cans of
baked beans. On $50 a day? Possibly, if you don’t mind camping or bunk-
ing in a youth hostel and very basic dinners. Being realistic, however,
you can bet on a figure more like $125 to $175 per person per day —
more if you factor in full-time car rental and gasoline (petrol) costs. And
that figure doesn’t include the cost of actually getting to Scotland.
But sometimes you do get what you pay for. In this case, Scotland usu-
ally compensates for the proverbial price of admission.
Transportation
Car rental (or car hire per the local vernacular) isn’t especially exorbi-
tant, but visitors will likely find the cost of gasoline to be staggeringly
high. Remember, here it’s called petrol and is priced in liters, not gallons.
It costs about 3.5 times more than the average in the United States. On
the plus side, however, your rental car will probably get exceptional
miles per liter (which is how it’s measured here), and the driving dis-
tances across Scotland are miniscule compared to cross-country travel
in the United States, Canada, or Australia. Usually the car rental rates
include unlimited mileage. Check with your auto insurance company to
see if you need to buy extra coverage for when you’re in Scotland. (I dis-
cuss insurance coverage for travelers in Chapter 10.)
Although it may limit your mobility, using public transportation can cut
your costs. If you’re only planning to visit Edinburgh, Glasgow, and some
side-trip destinations, you don’t really need to rent a car.
Lodging
Hotel rooms in Scotland aren’t cheap. If, however, you do your home-
work and scour accommodation Web sites, you will find rates consider-
ably lower than the standard “tariff” that’s quoted by each hotel. If you
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
64

want luxury or a spectacular view, however, you will have to pay a 
premium. If you just need a leak-proof roof over your head, a place 
to wash, and a clean bed, then you can easily save money on your
accommodations.
Generally speaking, a double room runs about $170 to $250 per night;
those on the low end are around $100 to $120, and on the high end you’ll
be spending $300 or quite a bit more. Self-catering cottages rented by
the week ($450–$1,200 per week) and country B&Bs are almost always
less expensive ($50 per person). Places that remain open year round
often charge less during the low season, October through March.
Dining
American visitors with their calculators at the ready will find out that
most food is typically more expensive in Scotland than in the U.S. But
you can cut your dining expenses by not choosing the ritziest restaurant
in town every night of the week. Keep an eye out for lunch specials and
pre-theater menus — they offer considerable savings. On the Web, inves-
tigate www.5pm.co.uk, which offers reductions on early evening dining
options, particularly in Edinburgh and Glasgow. If you stay in self-
catering accommodations, you’ll spend less on food by cooking it at
your rental cabin or apartment. Some groceries, particularly premium
items such as organic chicken, cost about the same as in the U.S. metro-
politan market.
A good per-person allowance for lunch is at least $20, and for dinner
between $30 and $60. Many hotels and lodges include breakfast in the
room rate, so at least you don’t have to figure that meal into your daily
food budget.
Sightseeing
The price of admission to many tourist attractions in Scotland is slightly
more modest than what you may expect to find in other Western European
countries. In Edinburgh, the permanent exhibitions of the Scottish
national galleries are priced just right: absolutely free. And similarly, 
in Glasgow, the city-run museums don’t cost a pence to enter. All the 
natural beauty of the countryside, from the Ayrshire coastline to the
Highlands, doesn’t cost you a thing and is indeed priceless.
Even if you see two or three attractions each day, a fair amount to
budget for sights is $20 per person per day.
Shopping
Jump back up to the introduction to this chapter and recall what I have
already said about consumer retail goods and their U.K. prices. A pair of
Calvin Kleins may have the same sticker price as its counterpart in the
U.S., but they will actually cost nearly twice as much given the exchange
rate. Still, you can find “home-grown” commodities in Scotland that are
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 65

less expensive when purchased here: woolen goods or cashmere, local
crafts and arts, and more. Be selective in your purchases and your bank
balance will be better off.
Nightlife
Here, as with sightseeing, you may find that things are cheaper than you
anticipated, particularly the theater, dance, and even opera. In pubs and
bars, prices of alcohol are at the higher end but not ridiculously so. In
general, expect the equivalent of big city (Toronto, San Francisco, or
Melbourne) prices for nightlife in Scotland. A pint of lager or ale will cost
between $3.30–$5. A dram of whisky is sometimes as little as $3, but
cocktails are at least $6 and typically more. 
In Table 5-1, I take the daily estimates laid out in this section and add
them up for a projection of how much it typically costs to accommodate
and entertain one person for one week in Scotland.

Cutting Costs without Cutting the Fun
If worries about travel costs mean you’re hesitant to go to Scotland, you
have two options: Simply stay home and miss out — or get over it. Sure,
Scotland isn’t the cheapest European country to visit, but nor is it the
costliest, and it can be made more affordable. Make sensible decisions,
look for those bargains that don’t cheapen the experience, and you
should be fine.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
66

Some tourists demand to be pampered in five-star hotels, but those
places are exceptionally expensive in Scotland. If you’re flexible when it
comes to the pampering, you should seek out the smaller lodges and
guesthouses that are priced to fit tighter travel budgets. A nice perk of
most Scottish accommodations is that breakfast is included in the price
of the room. Sometimes it’s even hearty enough to keep you full until
dinner.
Also, some visitor attractions are free. Even if you stick to seeing things
that cost nothing (although you shouldn’t skip the other sights just
because of the cost), you’ll still experience a vast amount of the country.
You can find plenty of ways, some little and some big, to cut down on
costs. Here are some smart ways to save on your trip to Scotland.
 Go in mid-season or off-season. Traveling between mid-September
and mid-April should save you money on your airfare and accom-
modations. The days leading up to and just after Christmas, New
Year’s Eve, and Easter are the exceptions, and prices jump up
during those periods. (See Chapter 3 for more info on Scotland’s
seasons.)
 Travel midweek. Most everybody wants to travel on the weekends,
but those willing to travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday
can usually find cheaper flights. When inquiring about airfares, ask
if you get a cheaper rate if you fly on a different day. Also remember
that staying over a Saturday night can occasionally cut airfares by
half.
 Remember that group rates can save money. And you don’t neces-
sarily have to be one of a busload to get them. Sometimes a party
as small as three people qualifies for group rates.
 Get the Explorer Pass. Historic Scotland, which operates 75 differ-
ent historic attractions across Scotland, offers an Explorer Pass
that allows multiple entries to all of their sites from Iona Abbey to
St. Andrews Cathedral to Edinburgh Castle. The pass is sold at
most of the sites run by the organization. For more information, call
% 0131-668-8600 or visit www.historic-scotland.gov.uk.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 67
Better too much than not enough
Make sure you have access to emergency money in case you need it. If you golf, add
up greens fees and the price of renting clubs (assuming you’re not lugging your own
around the country). Do you plan to buy clothes, jewelry, crystal, and antiques, or just
pick up a few postcards, a snow globe, and a couple of cheap souvenirs? A modest
piece of crystal can set you back $80; a nice Edinburgh sweatshirt, about $50. So gauge
your impulse-buying tendencies and factor that into your budget as well.

 Try a package deal. Many people believe that planning a trip
entirely on their own is less expensive, but they’re not necessarily
correct. Travel packages can save not only money but also time. A
single phone call to a travel agent or package tour operator can
take care of your flight, accommodations, transportation within the
country, and sightseeing arrangements. Even if you’re not up for a
complete package — if you’d prefer to pay for your plane tickets
with frequent-flier miles, say, or if you don’t like some of the things
the package tour operators offer — you can book room-car deals
(which include a free rental car) or other combo packages directly
through many hotels. Chapter 6 contains more details on package
deals.
 Always ask about discounts. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, university alumni associations, or other
groups often qualifies you for discounted rates on plane tickets,
hotel rooms, and (mainly with U.S.-based companies) car rentals.
Some car-rental companies give discounts to employees of compa-
nies that have corporate accounts. With valid identification, 
students, teachers, youths, and seniors may be entitled to dis-
counts. Many attractions have discounted family prices. Ask 
about everything — you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Book your rental car at weekly rates, when possible. Weekly
rentals are most often offered at a discounted rate.
 Know where to buy petrol. The United Kingdom has some of the
highest gasoline prices in Europe, and parts of rural Scotland have
the highest prices in the U.K. One way to ease the burden of these
exorbitant rates is to fill your tank in cities and larger towns. For
the most part, the smaller the town, the higher the price of gas.
Also, you may find lower gas prices at petrol stations at large
supermarkets, such as Tesco or Asda.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you
save money on gas to boot. Unless you’re traveling with kids and
need lots of space, don’t go beyond the economy size. For more on
car rentals, see Chapter 7.
 Walk. All cities in the country are easy to explore on foot, even
Glasgow and Edinburgh. Hoofing it can save you a few extra pounds
(and even burn off a few from your waistline). As a bonus, you’ll 
get to know your destination more intimately as you explore at a
slower pace.
 Skimp on souvenirs. As a general rule, souvenirs specially created
for the tourist market are poorly made and over-priced. If you’re
concerned about money, you can definitely do without the T-shirts,
key chains, and other trinkets.
 Use ATMs to get money. The exchange rate of most banks’ ATM
machines — or cash points — is surprisingly competitive. Yes, 
your bank back home may charge a small fee, but it won’t charge a
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
68

percentage commission on the money you withdraw. And yes, don’t
be silly, it comes out in the local currency, not dollars.
 Use libraries for Internet access. Because of Western tourists’
growing use of the Internet, online access is popping up all over
Scotland. Most town libraries have access, and they usually don’t
charge or require you to be a member. This policy may change in
the coming years, but for now, libraries are a good, cheap option
for surfing the Web.
 Pick up free, coupon-packed visitor pamphlets and magazines.
Detailed maps, feature articles, dining and shopping directories,
and discount and freebie coupons make these pocket-size give-
aways a smart pickup. You’ll find these types of materials in tourist
board offices and, perhaps, in the lobby of your hotel.
 Skip the fantabulous hotel room views. Rooms with great views
are the most expensive in any hotel. Unless you’re planning to hang
out in your room all day, why hand over the extra dough?
 Get out of town. In many places, hotels located just outside popu-
lar tourist areas may be a great bargain and require only a little
more driving — and they may even offer free parking. Sure, you
may not get all the fancy amenities, and you’ll probably have to
carry your own bags, but the rooms may be just as comfortable
and a whole lot cheaper.
 Ask whether your children can stay in your room for free.
Although many accommodations in Scotland charge by the head,
some may allow your little ones to stay for free. Even if you have to
pay $10 or $15 for a rollaway bed, in the long run you’ll save hun-
dreds by not having to pay for two rooms.
 Avoid making phone calls from a hotel room. The inflated fees
that hotels charge for phone calls are scandalous. Walk to the near-
est coin- or card-operated phone to make calls within and out of
the country.
 Consider rooms that aren’t en-suite. Rooms without a bathroom
are cheaper, although they’re increasingly hard to find. Sharing a
bathroom may be a small sacrifice when it comes to saving money,
and it doesn’t really detract from your trip. Group hostel rooms are
even cheaper if you’re willing to rough it a bit more.
 Check out accommodations with kitchens. By renting self-catering
apartments or cottages for a week or more, you can save money
overall on accommodations (especially if you’re traveling with a
group) and on food, because you can prepare your own meals in
the kitchen. By avoiding big-ticket restaurant meals, you’ll save a
heck of a lot of money.
 Have the same meal for less money. If you enjoy a late lunch (or
an early evening meal) at a nice restaurant and settle for a snack
later, your wallet will thank you. Lunch and pre-theater menus often
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 69

offer the same food as dinner menus, but the prices are much less
expensive.
 Before you leave home, check prices on items you think you may
want to buy. This way, you’ll know whether you’re really getting a
bargain by buying items abroad. Spending a little time surfing the
Web is an easy way to find the information you need.
 Look before you tip. Some restaurants include a service fee or gra-
tuity on the bill, especially if you’re with a group. Study your bill:
You could be paying a double tip by mistake. And don’t tip bar-
tenders for drinks — they don’t expect it.

Handling Money
After you settle on a budget for your trip, you can start figuring out the
nuts and bolts of carrying money abroad. How much money do you want
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
70

to bring along? Do you want to carry cold, hard cash, credit cards, trav-
eler’s checks, or all three? How can you get more money after you’re in
Scotland? What’s the best way to exchange dollars for pounds? And how
can you ensure that your money will be safe and secure while you’re
vacationing?
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what currency alternative is your favorite. That’s not going to change
much just because you’re on vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving
around more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless
you happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may
let your mind slip into vacation mode and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be available to you away from home is your
personal checkbook. In Scotland, they don’t even spell it the same way.
There, it is a chequebook. This section offers just about everything you
need to know about money matters in Scotland.
The local currency: What it’s worth to you
The currency in Scotland, British pence and pounds sterling, is quite simi-
lar to American cents and dollars. The denominations of your loose
change (though not the sizes) are almost the same: The few anomalies
include 2-pence coins, the 20-pence coin (there’s no equivalent to the
U.S. quarter), and the 1- and 2-pound coins. Pence are often just referred
to as “p,” such as in “Do you have 30p for the pay phone?” A pound is
also known colloquially as a “quid.” Some people may refer to a “bob” —
this is equivalent to 5p, which used to be known as a “shilling” before
the decimal system was imposed in 1971.
Although the U.K.’s official central bank, called the Bank of England, con-
trols monetary matters across Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a
couple of banks in Scotland, such as the Clydesdale Bank, have permis-
sion to print Scottish bills in 5-, 10-, and 20-pound denominations. They
feature Scottish historical figures such as Sir Walter Scott or William
Wallace (rather than the queen). There’s no value difference between
these pound notes and those printed in England, and both are accepted
throughout Scotland.
Be careful if you travel to England with Scottish bank notes. Although
they’re perfectly legal tender in England, they aren’t always accepted by
shops and restaurants, where employees are unaccustomed to seeing
Scottish bank names on the folding money. Err on the side of caution
and go to a bank and exchange any Scottish bills for Bank of England
notes before heading south of the border.
As I’ve said throughout this chapter, goods and services are often more
expensive in Scotland than they would be in the U.S. or in other English-
speaking countries. Many items sold in Scotland are priced with the
same numerical amount as they would be in the U.S. — for instance, if a
soda costs a dollar in the U.S., it’s often priced at a pound (about $1.85)
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 71

in Scotland. But because you get less than 60 pence for every dollar you
exchange, things cost between 50 percent and 100 percent more in
Scotland. This increase isn’t true of all items, but it gives you a general
idea of how far your new cash and weighty coins will go.
The exchange rate fluctuates daily (by small amounts). The best source
for up-to-date currency exchange information is online at www.xe.

What’s up with the euro?
Europe’s common currency, the euro, isn’t used in Scotland. Why not? Well, a huge
debate once raged among U.K. politicians and people over trading the pound for the
euro. After the Labour Party government was elected in 1997, it waffled politically and
only confused the issue by introducing some spurious economic hurdles. The party’s
main opposition, the Conservatives, have opposed dumping the pound for over 25
years. Increasingly many people doubt that the euro will ever be used officially. An
independent Scotland would probably accept the euro more quickly than the U.K. as
a whole, but nobody expects full Scottish autonomy anytime soon.
You may see euro equivalents calculated on some money transactions, but that’s only
designed to get consumers familiar with the new money. A few euro-friendly busi-
nesses in Scotland do accept the euro — otherwise it’s about as useful as a dollar.

You can exchange money anywhere you see the Bureau de Change sign.
You will often see it at travel agencies, banks, post offices, and tourist
information offices. Generally, you’ll get the best rates at banks; the local
tourist office can tell you the location of the bank branch nearest you.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and arguably the best way to get cash away from home is
from an ATM (automated teller machine), or cash point, as they are 
commonly called in Scotland. The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.
mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) net-
works span the globe; look at the back of your bank card to see which
network you’re on, then call or check online for ATM locations at your
destination. For example, the PLUS ATM locator (www.visa.via.
infonow.net) indicates that there are 100 machines in and around
Glasgow. Even up north in Inverness, it lists 84. 
Be sure that you know your personal identification number (PIN) and
your daily withdrawal limit, which of course you will need to convert to
pounds, before you leave home. Also keep in mind that many banks
impose a fee every time your card is used at a different bank’s ATM, and
that fee can be higher for international transactions (up to $5 or more)
than for domestic ones (where the fee’s rarely more than $1.50). On top
of this charge, the bank from which you withdraw cash may charge its
own fee, although that’s rare in Scotland. For international withdrawal
fees, contact your bank.
Despite the withdrawal charges, however, the expansion and integration
of ATMs have made obtaining cash a cinch in Scotland’s cities. Slip in
your card, type in your PIN, and withdraw money in pounds sterling
from your bank at home. The exchange rates are usually as good as
you’ll get anywhere else.
Not all ATMs in Scotland are connected to the global banking networks.
This is especially true in rural areas and in small banks. It’s best to not
depend solely on ATMs for cash when you’re traveling. Also, the security
risks are the same here as at home. If someone steals your card and
knows your personal identification number (PIN), the crook will try to
drain your bank account. Recently, machines have been rigged to “swal-
low” cards, which are later extracted and used illegally. All this is rare in
Scotland, but, nevertheless, you should exercise caution and avoid using
ATMs late at night or in poorly lit urban areas.
Be sure to check your daily withdrawal limit with your bank before you
set off on your trip. Remember, if your limit is $250, you’ll be able to
withdraw only about £135.
If you lose your ATM card, contact your bank at home and report the
loss immediately. You don’t want your bank account depleted in the
event that the card (and, in a worst-case scenario, personal identifica-
tion number) falls into the wrong hands.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 73

Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are invaluable when traveling. They’re a safe way to carry
money, they provide a convenient record of all your expenses, and they
generally offer relatively good exchange rates. You can also withdraw
cash advances from your credit cards at banks or ATMs, provided you
know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten yours or didn’t even know you had
one, call the number on the back of your credit card and ask the bank to
send it to you. Do this in advance of your trip because the number usu-
ally takes five to seven business days to arrive, although some banks will
provide the number over the phone if you tell them your mother’s
maiden name or some other personal information that verifies your
identity.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, banks may
assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee charged by Visa,
MasterCard, or American Express for currency conversion on credit
charges. But credit cards still can be the smartest way to go when you
factor in things such as exorbitant ATM fees and high traveler’s check
exchange rates (and service fees).
Visa and MasterCard are both widely used in Scotland. American
Express is accepted by most major businesses, but Diner’s Club is less
frequently accepted.
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used numerous times in a foreign destination and consequently
block your charges. Even if you don’t call your credit card company in
advance, you can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a
charge is refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you.
But perhaps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one
card with you on your trip; a card may not work for any number of rea-
sons, so having a backup is the smart way to go. Also, make certain you
have the credit card companies’ toll free or collect call numbers to
phone them from Scotland. You may want to keep multiple copies of
these numbers, in case your card (with the number on the back) is lost
or stolen.
If you’re an American Express card member, bring a single blank per-
sonal check and keep it in a separate place from your card. If the card is
lost or stolen, you can use that check to draw a cash advance against
your account. Just bring it, unsigned, into any AmEx office, and it’ll be
cashed on the spot.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities
have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as
needed. However, keep in mind that you’re likely to be charged an ATM
withdrawal fee if the bank isn’t your own, so if you’re withdrawing
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
74

money every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — 
provided that you don’t mind showing identification every time you
want to cash one.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
(with city center offices in both Edinburgh and Glasgow) offers denomi-
nations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only) $1,000. You’ll
pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent. You can also
get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling 
% 800-221-7282; AmEx gold and platinum cardholders who use this
number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent
and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500,
and $1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can
obtain Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling 
% 866-339-3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks; call % 800-
223-9920 for a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of 
their serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they’re
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Taking Taxes into Account
All goods and services in Scotland have a tax or tariff similar to the local
sales taxes in the U.S. It’s called a value-added tax (VAT) and is a rather
whopping 17.5 percent. The good news is that any tourist who lives out-
side of the European Union is entitled to get a refund on any VAT paid for
goods that they take out of the European Union — as long as they make
those purchases at shops that are part of the Retail Export Scheme 
(look for signs saying “Tax Free Shopping”). The tax-back scheme is
great for tourists who spend large sums of money on books, jewelry,
gifts, clothes — you name it (except, alas, for services such as hotels,
restaurants, or car rental). 
But many tourists come to Scotland, spend lots of money, and never find
out how to get their VAT back or don’t bother because they don’t fully
understand how it works. To ensure that you don’t make the same mis-
take, here’s your quick guide to the VAT.
When you make your purchase, show your passport and ask for a tax
refund form. Fill out the form and keep any receipts. When you leave the
U.K., submit the form to Customs for approval. Once Customs has
stamped it, there are a variety of ways to recover the tax. You can mail
the form back to the shop and arrange repayment by post. Some shops
are part of networks run by a commercial refund companies, who you
later contact for a refund, although an administration fee may be
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 75

charged. Some London airport terminals may have refund booths where
immediate repayments can be received. 
If you are going to another E.U. country, the scheme doesn’t work: You
must be leaving the E.U. zone. Also, U.K. Customs advises that you
should arrange the method of tax reimbursement with the retailer when
you purchase the product. For more information, log on to www.visit
britain.com and do a site search for “VAT refunds.” For more informa-
tion on a commercial refund company, try logging on to www.global
refund.com or www.premiertaxfree.com.
Remember not all VATs are refundable. Those added to services aren’t
refundable. Hotels, restaurants, and car rentals, for example, charge VAT
that you can’t get back.
Protecting Yourself and Your Money
Rest easy: You’re going to a safe country. The occurrence of violent
crime is reasonably low in Scotland, although it’s higher in some city 
districts, of course. Handguns are banned across the entire U.K., and
Scotland has so few pistols on the streets that police, as a rule, don’t
even carry them. In 2006, a report found that cops in the entire country
had only shot firearms 34 times in seven years. 
Theft is not a major problem — especially if you use common sense and
guard yourself against it. Pickpockets look for people who seem to have
the most money on them and know the least about where they are.
Getting money from an ATM late at night on a deserted street in Glasgow
or Edinburgh is probably not particularly wise. Also, don’t leave large
sums of money lying around your hotel in the city, unless it is one with
good security.
Crime is a fact of modern city life. In many rural areas of Scotland, how-
ever, people don’t even bother locking their house doors at night.
If your wallet is lost or stolen, don’t panic. Contact all your credit card
companies the minute you discover the loss. Most credit card compa-
nies have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or
stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or
deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two.
Contact the police by going to a station, stopping a passing cop, or dial-
ing % 999 on any telephone. In order to cancel charges or cover your
loss, your credit card company or insurer may require a police report;
plus, contacting the police ensures that any lost items can easily be
returned to you if they’re found.
Except for the cash, everything in your wallet is replaceable, and you
probably can get emergency cash by contacting your bank. Most larger
banks will accept collect calls. You may be able to get cash from your
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
76

checking account wired as a Moneygram and sent to a travel agent or
perhaps to your hotel in Scotland. Fees will apply, but at least you won’t
starve. If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when all banks
and American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to
you via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
“Chip and PIN” is the system in Scotland regarding credit card pur-
chases. That means that all credit cards issued there have a computer
chip in them and users must know their PIN numbers in order to make
purchases. No signatures are required. Cards without chips can still be
used, however.
Scottish merchants are careful about checking the signatures on receipts
against credit cards, but a smart thief can master the fine art of forging
your signature. Make sure your cards really are lost before reporting
them gone, but after you’re certain, make the calls. You’re expected to
phone immediately upon realizing your credit cards are gone.
The phone numbers to report lost or stolen credit cards while you’re in
Scotland are
 Visa (% 0800-891-725)
 MasterCard (% 0800-964-767)
 American Express (% 01273-696-933)
 Diner’s Club (% 0870-190-0011)
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at % 800-555-
1212.
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications, especially if you’ve
lost your passport along with your cash and credit cards. If you lose
your passport, contact the U.S. consulate general in Edinburgh by calling
% 0131-556-8315, although you will need to travel to London and appear
in person at the full-blown American Embassy to replace it. It may be
wise to notify the major credit-reporting bureaus, as placing a fraud alert
on your records may protect you against liability for criminal activity.
The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are Equifax (% 800-766-
0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-3742; www.experian.
com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.transunion.com).

In This Chapter

V
isiting castles, relaxing in local pubs, and exploring the Highlands
are the easy parts of traveling to Scotland. The more difficult issue
is making plans to get yourself there. Several resources, however, make
planning your travel to Scotland virtually painless. This chapter dis-
cusses how to find those resources in addition to helpful hints on things
from bargain airfares to the lowdown on love-’em-or-hate-’em package
tours.
Flying to Scotland
Unless you fancy a long boat ride, you’re most likely to fly into the
United Kingdom, arriving in Scotland directly or via England or some
other European hub, such as Dublin, Reykjavik, or Amsterdam.
Identifying your airline options
A few carriers fly directly from the U.S. (namely greater New York,
Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Orlando) to Scotland. But often the service is
seasonal (May–Sept) and seems to change every year. For example, in
2006, American Airlines announced it was terminating its Chicago to
Glasgow service. Long-distance carriers don’t yet appear convinced that
the market is solid enough to make a commitment to direct flights to
Scotland. 
Still, almost every airline in the world seems to fly into one of London’s
airports, so getting north from there to Scotland will entail only a short
flight (about one hour, unless you’re headed to the Highlands) or a four-
to five-hour train ride to get north across the border.
If you’re traveling from down under, no airlines currently fly directly
from Australia or New Zealand to Scotland. All flights on international
airlines from these two countries go through London.

The major airlines listed below offer U.K. flights, including a few direct to
Scotland. Be sure to call more than one airline to compare prices.
 Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.ca)
 American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com)
 British Airways (% 800-247-9297; www.britishairways.com)
 Continental Airlines (% 800-231-0856; www.continental.com)
 Delta Airlines (% 800-241-4141; www.delta.com)
 Northwest Airlines (% 800-447-4747; www.nwa.com)
 United Airlines (% 800-538-2929; www.united.com)
 US Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com)
 Virgin Atlantic (% 800-862-8621; www.virgin-atlantic.com)
If you travel via London, you can opt for a short flight to Scotland. British
Airways (% 0870-850-9850; www.britishairways.com) has several 
per day. BMI (% 0870-607-0555; www.flybmi.com) offers internal U.K.
flights. Flybe (% 0871-700-0535 or % 44-1392-268-520 from outside the
U.K.; www.flybe.com) is a discount airline that crisscrosses the U.K.
Regardless of whether you’re coming to Scotland directly or from a
transfer point, you’ll most likely fly into Glasgow or Edinburgh. Both air-
ports are easy to get in and out of and offer easy transportation into the
cities. Because of the frequency of flights into these airports, you’re
more likely to find a cheap fare to them compared to flights to smaller
Scottish cities, such as Inverness, Aberdeen, or Dundee. Both Edinburgh
and Glasgow offer perfectly fine airports, and neither option outweighs
the other in terms of proximity to a city.
Glasgow International Airport (% 0870-040-0008) is at Abbotsinch,
near Paisley, only about 16km (10 miles) west of the city via M8. Edin-
burgh International Airport (% 0870-040-0007) is about 10km (6 miles)
west of the city’s center and has become a growing hub for flights both
within the British Isles and to and from Continental Europe. South of
Glasgow is Prestwick International Airport (% 0871-223-0700; www.
gpia.co.uk), which is favored by some of the low-budget airlines such
as RyanAir. Prestwick’s on the railway line to Ayr, about a 45-minute ride
from Glasgow’s Central Station. (For pointers on planning your itinerary,
and help on deciding your arrival and departure points, see Chapter 4;
for details on getting to Edinburgh or Glasgow, see Chapters 11 and 12.)
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major airlines is unlike that of any other indus-
try. Every airline offers virtually the same product, yet prices can vary
by hundreds of dollars.
Chapter 6: Getting to Scotland 79

If you can book your ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and
are willing to travel midweek (Tues–Thurs), you can qualify for the least
expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. Obviously, planning
ahead pays.
Several reliable consolidators operate worldwide and are available on
the Web. STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the
world’s leader in student-aimed travel, offers good fares for travelers of
all ages. ELTExpress (% 800-TRAV-800; www.flights.com) started in
Europe and has excellent fares worldwide, but particularly to that conti-
nent. LowestFare.com (% 800-FLY-CHEAP; www.1800flycheap.com) is
owned by package-holiday megalith MyTravel and so has especially
good fares to sunny destinations. Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447;
www.airticketsdirect.com) is based in Montreal and leverages the
currently weak Canadian dollar for low fares.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air travel tickets purchased via the Internet. (Canadian
travelers should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K.
residents can go for www.expedia.co.uk and www.opodo.co.uk.) Each
online agency has different arrangements with the airlines and may offer
different fares on the same flights, so shopping around is wise. If you reg-
ister for the service, Expedia and Travelocity will send you an e-mail
notification when a cheap fare becomes available to your favorite desti-
nation. Of the smaller travel agency Web sites, SideStep (www.sidestep.
com) receives good reviews from users. It’s purports to “search 140 sites
at once” and allows you to open a browser and purchase flights from the
sites that they search.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service such as Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The airlines are all major, well-
known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadelphia to
Scotland via Dallas is remote. But your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or 11
p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices before you buy;
Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to play
their “name your price” game. Note: In 2004, Priceline added nonopaque
service to its roster. You now have the option to pick exact flights, times,
and airlines from a list of offers (at prices similar to other nonopaque
Web sites) — or opt to bid on opaque fares as before.
Taking the Train
Taking a train to Scotland from London or from other cities with air-
ports, such as Manchester, isn’t as fast as flying, but you get to admire
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
80

the countryside, arrive at your destination right in the heart of town,
and not contribute to damaging the environment. The four and a half to
five and a half hours on the train to Edinburgh or Glasgow from London
takes up precious time (when you could be sightseeing), so you may
want to inquire about red-eye trips that let you sleep on the train
(because you’re traveling during the night).
The trains that link London to Edinburgh (via Newcastle) on the East
Coast Main Line are reasonably fast, efficient, and generally relaxing,
with restaurant and bar service as well as air-conditioning. Trains depart
from London’s King’s Cross Station (call National Railway Enquiries 
% 08457-48-49-50 for rail info; from outside the U.K. call % 44-207-278-
5240) repeatedly throughout the day and arrive in Edinburgh at Waver-
ley Station in the heart of the city. The trip generally takes four and a
half hours. Off-peak fares bought in advance can range widely, from
around £25 to £93 ($46–$172) and the government is examining whether
they should be less variable. Off-peak first-class tickets purchased in
advance also vary widely from about £30 to £100 ($56–$185), although
the cheapest fares seem to be rarely available. A fully flexible “buy any-
time, travel anytime” standard open single fare is upwards of £120 ($222).
The Caledonian Sleeper service for overnight travel can cost about £100
($185), but online bargains booked well in advance can mean the trip
may cost as little at £19 ($35). You can easily make taxi and bus connec-
tions at Waverley Station, which also serves Glasgow with a First Scot-
Rail (www.firstgroup.com/scotrail) shuttle service every 15
minutes during the day and every 30 minutes in the evenings until 
about 11:30 p.m. The one-way fare during off-peak times (travel after 
9:15 a.m. and not from 4:15–6:30 p.m.) is £8.80 ($16).
Trains from London arrive in Glasgow at Central Station in the heart of
the city (call National Railway Enquiries % 08457-48-49-50 for rail info;
from outside the U.K. call % 44-207-278-5240). The trains that directly
link London and Glasgow (via Preston and Carlisle from London’s Euston
Station) on the West Coast Main Line don’t have the reputation for effi-
ciency of those going to Edinburgh. And they are generally little quicker
than taking the train to Glasgow via Edinburgh. The trains (operated by
Virgin; % 08457-222-333; www.virgin.com/trains) on the West Coast
Main Line depart from London’s Euston Station every hour or so and the
trip to Glasgow generally takes five and a half hours these days. If you
plan a trip on the West Coast Main Line, call and find out if any major
“track works” are scheduled during your journey. If so, you can expect
delays and the possibility of riding a bus for a portion of the trip. Virgin
prices, similar to all the United Kingdom’s train-operating companies,
are diverse and complicated. In general, you might get a one-way ticket
for as little as £35 ($65) although the standard advance purchased ticket
is more likely to be between £90 to £100 ($167–$185).
You may prefer to take a train from London’s Kings Cross up the East
Coast Main Line via Newcastle, Edinburgh, and across (via Motherwell)
to Glasgow. The time it takes is about the same as the West Coast Line. 
Chapter 6: Getting to Scotland 81

Glasgow’s Central Station is also the terminus for trains arriving from
the southwest of Scotland and a hub for numerous trains to city suburbs
in most directions. A ten-minute walk away (or via shuttle bus 398) is
Queen Street Station. From here, First ScotRail (www.firstgroup.com/
scotrail) shuttle service is available to and from Edinburgh, as I said
already. 
Trains to and from points north of Edinburgh and Glasgow depart from
both cities about three to five times daily, although frequency is reduced
during the low season (from the end of Sept to about Easter).
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect on
each leg of your journey. You know your costs up front and, in the case
of the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. A great thing about
escorted tours is that they can take you to the maximum number of
sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, purchasing travel insurance is
strongly recommended, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay
your trip costs up front. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator!
If the tour operator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the
vacation you paid for, there’s no reason to think that it will fulfill its
insurance obligations either. Get travel insurance through an independ-
ent agency. (You can find out more about the ins and outs of travel insur-
ance in Chapter 10.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the operator cancel the trip if
it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you’re
unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If the operator 
cancels?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours worth of activity into a 24-hour day, or does it give you
ample time to relax by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m.
every day and not returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds
like a grind, certain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. A tour operator
may give you an evasive answer to this question because they may
not know the exact size of the group until everybody has made
reservations, but they should be able to give you a rough estimate.
Also, get an idea of the general age range of the group; whether the
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
82

tour’s geared to seniors, students, families, or some other demo-
graphic may affect your decision to sign up.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size and may cancel the tour if it doesn’t book enough
people. Find out if a quota exists and how close the operator is to
reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their answers,
but it may help you select a tour that’s sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. How much flexi-
bility do you have? Can you opt out of certain activities, or does
the bus leave once a day with no exceptions? Are all your meals
planned in advance? Can you choose your entree at dinner?
Depending on your recreational passions, one of the following escorted
tour companies may suit you:
 CIE Tours International (% 800-CIE-TOUR; www.cietours.com)
does tours of the United Kingdom and offers a five-day, four-night
escorted tour of Scotland, among other tours. The Web site fea-
tures a helpful tour index with package prices, descriptions, and
itineraries. Expect to pay around $700 (not counting airfare) per
person.
 Globus (% 866-755-8581; www.globusandcosmos.com) is a first-
class, worldwide tour company. Globus has comprehensive 9- and
15-day tours of Scotland. You can book a whole package (including
airfare, meals, hotels, and so on) or find your own cheap plane
ticket (good for those travelers racking up frequent-flier miles) and
book only the bus-tour part with Globus. Prices (including airfare)
range from about $1,775 to $3,250 per person.
 Scottish Tours (% 0131-557-8008; www.scottishtours.co.uk)
offers six mini-tours in air-conditioned buses departing from
Edinburgh. The most elaborate is a three-day, two-night excursion
that goes from the Scottish capital to Inverness on day one and
then visits the northeastern tip of the country. Per person rates
start at around £31 ($57) for one-day trips and go up to £225 ($416)
for two nights (including breakfast and accommodation).
 Cosmos (% 800-276-1241; www.cosmosvacations.com) is the
budget arm of Globus and offers scaled down versions of the
Globus trips (although you don’t see a great price difference), with
a tour guide and motorcoach on hand at all times. Prices (including
airfare) run from $1,400 to $1,900 per person.
Choosing a Package Tour
For many destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. A pack-
age tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to and from the
Chapter 6: Getting to Scotland 83

airport often costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book yourself.
That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators, who then
resell them to the public.
Some packagers offer a better class of hotels than others; others provide
the same hotels for lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled air-
lines; others sell charter flights. In some packages, your choice of
accommodations and travel days may be limited. Some let you choose
between escorted vacations and independent vacations, and others
allow you to add on just a few excursions or escorted day trips (also at
discounted prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), and United
Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). Several big
online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and
Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in travel packages.
Depending on your interests, one of the following packaged tour compa-
nies may suit you.
 CIE Tours International (% 800-CIE-TOUR; www.cietours.com):
Details can be found in the section “Joining an Escorted Tour” ear-
lier in this chapter.
 Brian Moore International Tours (% 800-982-2299; www.bmit.
com) offers “Air Inclusive” vacations to Edinburgh from around $500
during the low season.
 Freedom Scotland Holidays (% 0132-487-8617; www.freedom
scotland.com) is slightly different than other package tour opera-
tors in that they ask what interests you and then set up an itinerary
and accommodations based on your interests and what you wish to
pay. Fees vary.
 Thistle Golf (Scotland) Limited (% 0141-248-4554; www.thistle
golf.co.uk) offers various golfing tours, such as one that covers
both Ayrshire in the southwest and St. Andrews northeast of Edin-
burgh. Prices depend on the touring region and the length of your
stay, so contact the company for details.

Chapter 7
Getting Around Scotland
In This Chapter
 Renting cars and navigating one-lane highways in Scotland
 Catching the breathtaking views by train or bus
 Getting to the beautiful islands by ferry
You do have choices when it comes to getting around Scotland:
train, car, bus, ferry, bicycle, or on foot. Some visitors to Scotland
rent cars for the duration of their visits because automobiles provide a
sense of mobility that travelers appreciate — and are accustomed to.
Certainly, in remote areas such as the Highlands, some form of personal
transportation is almost essential because towns and villages are few
and far between, plus public transportation can be limited. 
Still, if your budget, length of stay, or specific destinations don’t make
driving mandatory, a variety of public transportation options can get
you where you need to go. I have been from Glasgow to the isles of Mull
and Iona, depending solely on trains, buses, and ferries (plus my own
two feet and a rented bicycle). It imposed some limitations, for sure, but
it also liberated me from the burden of driving, either in traffic or on
bendy, one-lane roads. If your trip is primarily to Edinburgh and/or
Glasgow, you don’t really need a car at all.
But I have also toured the very northern parts of the country in a rented
camper-van, taking my time, stopping frequently to have a better look at
the majestic scenery, and taking detours whenever I liked. Just remem-
ber, if you are traveling throughout Scotland by road, the country is a
virtual archipelago, settlements are separated by deep valleys, ragged
mountains, and especially long lochs; you may have to travel 100 miles
to cover 50 miles as the proverbial crow would fly. Plus, remote areas
often only have single lane roads, which will keep your speed down. 
This all means that some journeys, which don’t seem far on the map,
may take longer than anticipated, as narrow roads wind up and over
mountains — or snake around the shores of lochs. 

Getting Around by Car
For certain, seeing Scotland by car has its advantages, most notably the
lack of timetables to keep in mind and greater control over where you
want to go and when you want to go there. But you need to be aware 
of some driving-related issues that you will encounter while exploring
Scotland by car. 
To drive a car in Scotland for a limited period (up to 12 months), be cer-
tain that you have a valid driver’s license issued by local authorities
where you live permanently; you don’t need any special license.
Getting along with fewer road signs
One of the biggest complaints that tourists have about driving around
Scotland is the relative paucity of road signs. Most major attractions are
well marked, but the motorways around cities can be confusing, and
country roads often seem to lack the necessary signage. Having a good
map close at hand (as well as a navigator who can read it) to help track
your progress is always helpful. When in doubt, however, simply stop
and ask for directions.
Keeping up with street name switches
You’re in a city, you’re driving along such-and-such road, then suddenly
it has a new name, and two minutes later it changes again. This curious
phenomenon will come up often as you ply city streets. It’s actually
common for street names in Scotland to change. For example, the
famous Royal Mile in Edinburgh between the castle and Holyrood 
actually takes four different names along the way, from Castlehill to
Canongate. Now that’s royally confusing. Again, keep a map handy 
and refer to it often.
Driving on the left, roundabouts, and other differences
If you’re used to driving on the right-hand side of the road, driving on
the left-hand side is a shock initially. Perhaps what feels the strangest is
the fact that the driver’s seat and wheel is on the right-hand side of the
car while the gearshift is on the left (although the relative positions of
the clutch, brake pedal, and accelerator are the same). Note: Like the
rest of Europe, most cars in Scotland have manual transmissions and
stick shifts. If you need an automatic, make sure to request one specifi-
cally when reserving your rental car or van.
You merge to the right to get on highways, and you pass cars on the
right while slower traffic stays in the left lanes. Don’t pass cars (overtake
in local parlance) by using left-hand lanes designed for slower traffic. 
I know you may do it all the time at home, but it’s rarely seen here.
Overtake slower traffic only by using right-hand lanes meant for faster
traffic. And after you’ve safely passed someone, the courtesy to other
drivers who may want to pass you is to return to a center or left lane.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
86

Roundabouts (traffic circles) can be slightly tricky, but you’ll quickly get
the hang of them. First, traffic moves in a counterclockwise direction
through roundabouts. As you near one, remember that any traffic
approaching you from the right in the roundabout has the right of way.
Only when traffic approaching from the right clears, should you drive into
the roundabout. Once in, use your left turn signal to indicate which exit
you intend to take from a roundabout. If you find yourself driving in a
right-hand lane towards the core of a roundabout and can’t get safely to
your desired exit (on the left), don’t barge across. Simply go around the
circle again and prepare to exit the next time you approach your exit.
Staying safe on “single-track” roads
When you’re driving through the rural countryside or in small villages,
it’s quite common to find only one lane, or single-track, roads carrying
two-way traffic. Don’t panic. These roads will always have passing
places, often marked with a black and white striped pole or sign. If you
see a vehicle approaching in the opposite direction, pull into the passing
place if it’s on your left, giving the other person room to pass. You can
confirm your intentions by putting on your left turn signal (and you may
find that some drivers will flash their headlights in recognition).
If, however, the passing place is to the right on the single-track road, do
not pull into it. Stop where you are and just stay put (put on your left
turn signal if you like) and allow the oncoming vehicle to use the pull-
over space so that you may slide by.
In general, the driver who gets to a passing place first is meant to use 
it, but don’t get involved in games of “chicken” to see who pulls off 
first. Play it safe and be the one to give way. Also, on hills, the vehicle
going uphill has the right of way, as it is safer to reverse up a slope than
down one.
It’s a simple courtesy to acknowledge the other driver (who’s passing
you or whom you’re passing) with a small wave, sometimes as simple 
as a raised finger (not the middle one) from the steering wheel.
Planning your gasoline expenditures
Gas, called petrol in Scotland, is costly. Like everywhere, the cost of
gasoline in Scotland has risen this decade. Remember that the prices
posted here are per liter, not per gallon. You may find yourself paying
almost $2 for a liter — and there are nearly four of them in a gallon.
(Does public transportation sound a bit more appealing now?) Obviously,
to get the best gas mileage, rent the smallest vehicle you can. A small car
also helps you more easily navigate narrow roads.
Laying down the law on parking
In cities and towns, you will find some parking garages and outdoor car
lots. Street parking is also fine, but don’t assume that the absence of
American-style meters means that parking on the street is free. Check
Chapter 7: Getting Around Scotland 87

the signs. You may have to buy a ticket from a nearby machine that indi-
cates how long you can stay. Purchase a ticket and use the sticky back-
ing paper to affix it to your window. This system is used in some parking
lots, too. Some residential neighborhoods in the cities are very restric-
tive and allow only local residents to park in available places. Also, you
can never park where there is a double yellow line running along the
curb, nor where you see a zigzag white line.
Safety tips to know before you get behind the wheel
Here are some important traffic rules and laws to help you get around
safely and legally.
 At intersections marked with an inverted triangle (with the point
facing you) or at roundabouts, yield to traffic coming from your
right.
 You should not make left-hand turns (the equivalent of right-hand
turns in America) when the traffic light is red.
 The general speed limit on the open road is 60 mph (96 kmph)
unless otherwise posted. Standard 60 mph signs bear only a black
circle with a slash mark through it. When the speed limit is other
than 60 mph, you see a sign with a red circle and the limit written
inside in black. You often see these signs when entering small
towns, where you should reduce your speed to 30 mph, which is
also the limit in cities unless otherwise marked. On motorways, 
the speed limit is generally 70 mph, although plenty of drivers go
faster.
 A flashing yellow light means yield to pedestrian traffic but proceed
with caution when clear.
 A sign with a red circle and a red “X” through the middle means no
stopping or parking during posted hours. A zigzag white line along
the curb also means no parking or stopping unless it’s due to traffic
signals or congestion.
 Drivers and front-seat passengers must wear seat belts. If your car
has back-seat belts, passengers seated there must wear them also.
Renting a Car
Rates for car rental (or car hire, as the Scots say) can vary. The price
depends on the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and
when you pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and other factors.
Asking a few key questions may save you money.
 Some companies may assess a drop-off charge if you don’t return
the car to the same rental location.
 Ask if the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a location in town
rather than at the airport.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
88

 Find out whether age is an issue. Some car rental companies add on
a fee for drivers under 25 — and some don’t rent to them at all.
 If you see an advertised price, be sure to ask for that specific rate;
otherwise you may be charged the standard (higher) rate. Don’t
forget to mention membership in AAA, AARP, trade unions, and
other associations such as university alumni groups when making 
a reservation. These memberships may entitle you to discounts.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts for special deals. 
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask if the rate is the same for pickup on Friday morning
as it is on Thursday night.
 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can
check rates at most of the major rental agencies’ Web sites. Plus, 
all the major travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and
Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), for example — have
search engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates. Just
enter the car size you want and the pickup and return dates and
locations, and the server returns a price. You can even make the
reservation through any of these sites.
In addition to the standard rental prices, some optional charges might
apply to car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes).
In Scotland, you can pay a bit more to reduce the amount you would be
obligated to shell out if you have an accident. For example, a $40 fee for
a weekly rental will reduce your deductible (or excess in the U.K.) con-
siderably. Regardless, the car is fully insured against damage you incur
to your vehicle or someone else’s. 
Some U.S. companies offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your
initial full tank of gas up front and can then return the car with an empty
gas tank. The refueling package prices can be competitive with local gas
prices, but you don’t get credit for any gas remaining in the tank when
you return the car. I have not seen this in Scotland, but some companies
have a habit of giving you a vehicle with a partially full tank and you
must return it with just that amount. If it is less, they will charge you a
premium to get it back to the right level. Make sure you are clear how
much is in the tank before you leave with your rental.
Because the driver’s side is the right-hand front seat in Scotland, your
left arm, not your right, controls the stick shift. Rental companies have
few vehicles with automatic transmissions, so request one specifically if
you don’t know how to operate a manual transmission — or don’t think
your left arm is up to it. Minivans, or people movers, are more likely to
offer the option of automatic transmissions.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Scotland 89

As for the class of car available, you can expect a variety of levels:
budget or small (generally two-door run-arounds), compact (small but
might have four doors), medium or mid-size (four doors, more head
room, and larger trunk), and large or family (bigger still). Companies
often offer upgrades. You may think you want a larger vehicle, but keep
in mind that roads can be narrow. Get the smallest car you can, taking
into consideration your driving comfort, the comfort of your fellow trav-
elers, and the amount of luggage you’re carrying. Air-conditioning and
unlimited mileage are standard, but always confirm that there are no
mileage charges.
The following are a couple of issues you need to address when arranging
for your rental car.
 Where and when to pick up the car: If you fly into Edinburgh or
Glasgow and plan to stay in the city for two or more days, wait to
get the car until you’re just about to head out to the countryside. In
the city, you don’t need a car. Some companies have pick-up loca-
tions in or near the city. If you’re planning to leave town immedi-
ately or early the next morning, however, getting the car upon
arrival is a good idea. You can set out according to plan, and you
save the time and hassle of having to go back to the airport or
locate the rental agency the next day.
 How to pay for the car: Some companies require a deposit, gener-
ally on a credit card, when you make your reservation. If you book
by phone, the clerk may ask for the card number then; otherwise
you use your credit card at the rental desk.
If you’re not sure how long you need a car (if, maybe, you’re thinking
about coming back to Glasgow early to see more city sights), book your
rental for the shorter amount of time and extend it from the road with 
a simple phone call rather than bringing the car back early. If you’ve
booked a car for a week but bring it back after only four days, for exam-
ple, the company will post the refund to your credit card.
Rental-car companies in Scotland
All the major rental agencies are represented at the country’s two pri-
mary airports. In addition, in Glasgow, you can find
 Avis Rent-a-Car: 70 Lancefield St. (% 0870-608-6339; www.avis.
co.uk)
 Budget Rent-a-Car: 101 Waterloo St. (% 0800-212-636; www.
budget.co.uk)
 Arnold Clark: multiple locations (% 0845-607-4500; www.arnold

In Edinburgh city, try
 Avis: 5 West Park Place (% 0870-153-9103)
 Hertz: 10 Picardy Place (% 0870-846-0013; www.hertz.co.uk)
 Thrifty: 42 Haymarket Terrace (% 0131-337-1319; www.thrifty.

Taking the Train
First ScotRail runs the trains in Scotland. It’s not a publicly owned com-
pany, but rather a state-subsidized private firm that has a contract to
operate the trains. To confuse matters, the railway lines are owned by 
a different, pseudo-private company called Network Rail (formerly
Railtrack). Privatization of the railways has proved to be a poor decision
for most of Great Britain, a country that once led the way in the develop-
ment of the railroad.
The advantage of train travel is that you can generally sit back, relax,
and enjoy the scenery in a way that is often difficult when traveling by
road. With some exceptions, the trains in Scotland are reasonably effi-
cient and comfortable. On the downside, trains are more expensive than
in most European countries, and they travel to fewer destinations than
would be ideal. Nevertheless, when they run on time, train travel is a
good way to get from one part of the country to another.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Scotland 91
Does your boot go in your luggage 
or your luggage in your boot?
To spare you the confusion of car-related words and phrases in Scotland, here’s a list
of the most commonly used (and most commonly confused) terms you may come
across.
 boot: trunk
 bonnet: hood
 motorways: freeways
 pavement: sidewalk
 petrol: gasoline
 roundabouts: traffic circles (or “rotaries” if you’re a New Englander); make sure
you go left and yield to the right

Edinburgh Waverley has trains going southeast toward Berwick, west to
Glasgow, northwest towards Stirling, and north through Fife, Tayside,
and the Northeast. Glasgow’s Central Station is the terminus for trains
going southwest through Ayrshire and west to Greenock. Glasgow’s
Queen Street Station offers service to the west (Helenburgh, for exam-
ple), northwest into Argyll and the Highlands, and north through Stirling
and on into Tayside and Northeast. For journey planning, contact
Traveline Scotland on % 0870-608-2-608 or log on to www.traveline
scotland.com.
Generally speaking, you should have no problem buying tickets a half-
hour before departure, but during the high season, it never hurts to 
call the day before to confirm availability. For 24-hour rail and fare infor-
mation, call National Rail Enquiries % 08457-48-49-50 or log on to
www.firstscotrail.com. For general inquires, call First ScotRail at 
% 0845-601-5929.
Seeing Scotland by Bus
Buses are an adequate way to see Scotland. They make more stops than
the trains and are thus slower. But they cost less. The usual downsides
apply to bus travel: Unlike when you have a rental car, you’re not free 
to stop wherever and whenever you want — you’re stuck with the 
same people for hours at a time, and there’s not much space to move.
Regardless, the seating is comfortable, and the bus is a good way to
meet people. For journey planning, contact Traveline Scotland on 
% 0870-608-2-608 or log on to www.travelinescotland.com.
Scottish Citylink is Scotland’s largest cross-country bus company. It
offers services to 200 towns and cities across Scotland, including
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, Stirling, Perth, Inverness,
Aviemore, Thurso, Ullapool, Oban, Campbeltown, Lochgilphead, Fort
William, Portree, Glencoe, Dunfermline, and Dumfries. Information,
prices, times, and routes can be obtained by calling % 0870-550-5050
or by visiting www.citylink.co.uk. Stagecoach is another major opera-
tor, running buses to northeast Scotland, the Highlands, as well as
through central and southern areas. The company can be reached by
calling % 01292-613-500 or by visiting www.stagecoachbus.com.
Sightseeing bus tours can give a taste of the often-stunning countryside
on one-, two-, and three-day excursions. If this is your kind of travel, con-
sider the following tour companies:
 Scottish Tours (% 0871-200-800 or, in the U.S., call % 1-800-890-
7375; www.scottishtours.co.uk) offers one-day to five-day sight-
seeing tours of the country in air-conditioned buses. The most
elaborate is the “Highland Explorer” package, which departs from
either Edinburgh or Glasgow, taking passengers to Inverness, the
jumping off point for minibus excursions with a local guide to the
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
92

Isle of Skye, John O’Groats, and more. Prices start at around £31
($57) for one-day trips and go up to £560 ($1,036) for a single tourist
on the five-day tour (including breakfast and hotel accommodation).
 Timberbush Tours (% 0131-226-6066; www.timberbush-tours.
co.uk) use minibuses to take small groups to various locations,
from Edinburgh (from half-day to three-day) and Glasgow (one-day
only). One half-day tour is called “Kings, Queens, & Heroes,” and
operates off season, stopping at Linlithgow, Bannockburn, and
Stirling. Prices for the three-day tour to Skye, the Highlands, and
Loch Ness range from £90 ($167) in low season to £103 ($191) at
the height of summer. Prices only cover transportation and guide.
 Heart of Scotland Tours (% 0131-558-8855; www.heartof
scotlandtours.co.uk) offers one-day minibus tours of that
depart from Edinburgh’s Waterloo Place near Calton Hill at 8 a.m.
and 9 a.m. in the morning, returning to Edinburgh between 6 p.m.
and 8 p.m. Prices range from £26 to £32 ($48–$59).
 MacBackpackers (% 0131-558-9900; www.macbackpackers.com),
a company that runs youth hostels, offers a “hop-on, hop-off” bus
service for more intrepid adventurers. This bus does a circuit of
Scotland, stopping at Pitlochry, Inverness, Kyle of Lochalsh, Fort
William, Oban, and Glasgow. The basic price is £75 ($139). The
company also runs tours, such as the seven-day grand tour at £175
($324). Accommodation is not included, but it is guaranteed at hos-
tels, which average about £12 ($22) per night.
Finally, by Ferry
The preferable way to get from one island to the next in the Hebrides
(see Chapter 19) is by ferry. Few trips are more sublime than those 
that include a boat ride in Scotland’s picturesque seas. One company,
Caledonian MacBrayne, or CalMac for short, runs the major routes
between islands. You can take your car on most of the ferries, but a few
are vehicle-free and want to stay that way. Remember to call the day
before you hope to go out, because heavy seas can cancel ferry travel.
If you plan to see more than one island, you might look into CalMac’s
“Island Hopscotch” fares, which offer island-hopping tickets to selected
destinations and are valid for one month. For example you can rove from
the mainland ferry terminal at Mallaig to Skye, Skye to Harris, Harris to
Uist, and Uist back to the mainland port of Oban.
 Caledonian MacBrayne (% 01475-650-100; www.calmac.co.uk),
or CalMac, as it’s more colloquially known, serves 22 islands and 4
peninsulas over the western coast of Scotland.
 Northlink Ferries (% 0845-600-0449; www.northlinkferries.
co.uk) sail to Shetland and Orkney.

Booking Your
Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to expect in the way of accommodations
 Estimating how much you’ll pay to stay
 Determining your lodging needs
 Finding the best rates and reserving the best rooms
I
n this chapter, I provide an overview of the types of accommodations
available in Scotland, helping you choose what feels right in terms of
style, comfort, and budget. Individual accommodation listings appear in
each city and regional chapter later in this book (Part III and Part IV).
Getting to Know Your Options
The Scottish Tourist Board or, as it prefers to be called in the computer
age, Visitscotland.com, has instituted a grading system that ranks all
types of accommodations on the basis of their available amenities as
well as more subjective criteria such as hospitality, ambience, food, and
the condition of the property. This ranking system can be useful, but it
can also be misleading. The ranking may be lower than the place actu-
ally deserves simply because a room lacks a telephone or an accommo-
dation doesn’t include a television. Decide if certain amenities such as a
minibar or trouser press in your room are important to you, and then
find out what’s being offered by hotels or B&Bs.
Accommodations involved in the grading system display a blue plaque or
sticker (usually on or by the door) showing the number of stars earned. If
you don’t see the plaque and the lodging isn’t in the grading system, it’s
not necessarily a bad place to stay, but if you have a bad experience, the
tourist board has no authority to reprimand the establishment.
The tourist board’s grading system doesn’t rate the size, location, or
price of the place. It also only rates those establishments that pay to join
the tourist board and its scheme (which can put off some more frugal or
independently minded operators).

Knowing What You’ll Pay
I’ve tried to include some options for the budget-minded, but you should
anticipate that accommodations will be a good chunk of your traveling
expenses. In all my listings, the cost of a double room — one room for
you and a guest to stay in together — is given for each accommodation.
The figures may indicate a range of prices for a double room: that might
reflect different sizes of rooms, those with views compared to those with
none, or the off-season rate compared to the high season rate. Most
places offer a full breakfast — or at least a light Continental breakfast —
as part of the rate.
Each hotel listing is prefaced with a number of dollar signs ranging from
one ($) to four ($$$$), corresponding to price. Use Table 8-1 as a pricing
scale for quick reference; it shows you what you can expect in terms of
room size and standard amenities in each of these price categories.

Less than £55 ($102)
These accommodations are relatively

Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 95

Determining Your Accommodations Needs
Unless you are going to focus exclusively on one region, you probably
won’t be staying in a rented castle or a cottage during your trip to
Scotland. Check the Internet or local tourism boards for just the right
massive mansion or quaint cottage amid the heather for you. 
It’s much more likely that you’ll be staying in the more common choices
for accommodations in Scotland: hotels, B&Bs, and guesthouses.
Wherever you stay, you can expect generally friendly service, clean
rooms, and a decent breakfast. Smaller hotels with dining rooms, how-
ever, can be quite restrictive about when food is available.
The quality of food offered can vary from inn to inn. You may be frus-
trated to find that although you’re staying in a hotel at the edge of a
plentiful loch, the fish on the menu is frozen and deep-fried. If cuisine is
important to you, do a bit of homework before you decide where you’re
going to stay, especially if dinners are included in the room price.
Other accommodation options include self-catering properties, which
have kitchen facilities, and youth hostels.
You can find out much about the country’s different types of accommo-
dations and available package deals at the tourist board’s Web site,
www.visitscotland.com. The site lists a range of lodging choices,
including hotels, guesthouses, bed-and-breakfasts, caravan and camping
parks, and self-catering cottages.
Hotels
Most hotels will have tea- and instant coffee-making equipment (electric
kettles and cups) in most rooms. Bellhops (porters) aren’t so common,
however, except in the posh places. And smaller hotels sometimes lock
their front doors at certain (late) hours, so you may have to ring the bell
or knock to be let in after hours. Conversely, in the more remote areas,
they probably never lock the front door if staff are on the premises. As a
practice and courtesy, though, try to let a member of hotel staff know if
you plan to be out late.
Hotels are used to catering to tourists, and many will be helpful. You can
expect the furnishings to be comfortable, and many of the larger and
chain hotels have gyms, room service, and an in-house restaurant and
pub. Because you’re a resident, hotels are required to keep the bar open
until you retire for the night (but don’t abuse the privilege).
Hotel chains can be found in Scotland’s cities and larger towns. In some
cases, taverns or restaurants have overnight rooms, too. If you choose
to take a room in a pub, just be certain you’re not going to be troubled if
the Saturday night karaoke goes on until midnight.

Bed-and-breakfasts (B&Bs)
Many Scottish B&Bs take their hospitality seriously. You usually get to
know the owners (likely the same folks who cook and serve your break-
fast) — and you may come away feeling that you’ve made a new friend
or two. A guesthouse is, for the most part, the same thing as a B&B,
although generally a little larger.
Some B&Bs offer just a spare and comfortable bedroom (usually with a
bathroom attached) in someone’s home. Some B&B rooms, however,
aren’t en suite, meaning each room doesn’t have a private bathroom. If
you’re completely averse to sharing facilities with the folks down the
hall, make sure you ask for a room with its own bathroom (which may
cost a bit more).
Bed-and-breakfasts aren’t large — most are lucky to have four guest
rooms. The better-known B&Bs tend to fill up quickly during the high
season, so make your reservations as early as possible. Many B&Bs
don’t accept credit cards, so be prepared to pay in cash.
One advantage of choosing B&Bs over hotels is the price: They can be
much less expensive, but you don’t get the amenities of a hotel.
Self-catering cottages
Properties offered as self-catering run the gamut from modern apart-
ments to rooms within castles to country cottages. I have listed a few
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 97
Hello? Is this Scotland?
If you want to book your room over the phone, or if the place you want to stay at 
doesn’t have Internet booking abilities, you need to know how to call Scotland. To call
Scotland from anywhere in the world, dial the international access code (for exam-
ple, 011 from the U.S.), then the country code (44 for the U.K.), then the city or local
code (for example, Glasgow is 141), and then the number. (Note: When you’re calling
from within Great Britain, you need to add a zero before the city code.)
For example, if you’re in the States and you want to call a favorite watering hole in
Glasgow, the Babbity Bowster, just to make sure they’ll have enough wine ready when
you get there, you dial:
Int’l
Country
City
Number
011
+
44

552-5055
Remember, Scotland is five hours ahead of Eastern Time in the U.S. (eight hours ahead
of the West Coast). If it’s 1 p.m. in Philadelphia, it’s 6 p.m. in Peterhead. If you’re trying
to call a business in Scotland, call before noon EST to be safe (before 9 a.m. in San
Francisco).

but not many. Taking a self-catering accommodation is essentially simi-
lar to renting a condo. They’re a place to settle into and do things like
you might at home. At self-catering properties, you can cook your own
meals and make your own beds (or not).
Be certain you know what is provided in a self-catering facility — for
example, the provision of towels and bed linens can incur extra costs.
With self-catering properties, the price isn’t calculated per person and
is generally set for the week (although some also rent by the weekend,
for two to three days). When you take into account the amount of money
you would pay for hotels and B&Bs, staying in a self-catering lodging can
cut costs considerably. Food costs also decrease when you’re buying
your own and cooking it yourself. If you’re budget-minded, self-catering
is an option worth checking out.
A good place to begin researching self-catering properties is the
Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterers (www.assc.co.uk), whose 
members include owners and operators of a wide range of self-catering
properties, from cottages to chalets to lodges to castles.
Hostels
Hostels have a reputation of being the accommodation of choice for stu-
dents and frugal travelers. If the image you have of hostels is a place full
of young, perky travelers who can go for long stretches without showers
or food, you’re partly correct (though only partly). Hostels are for inde-
pendent travelers who cherish flexibility and want to stick to an accom-
modations budget. And although these accommodations are called
“youth hostels,” they take guests of any age, although most of the
people you encounter are in their early 20s. They’re also usually really
great places to meet fellow travelers.
Hostels sometimes don’t allow guests to remain in the building during
the day. You may have to get out and about from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
whether you like it or not.
Hostels across Scotland vary in quality and services. Some offer commu-
nal kitchens for you to bring in and cook your own food. Some even have
private rooms with en-suite bathrooms. Families can also stay in hostels,
renting a room with four bunks. The majority of hostels, though, are
places where people sleep dorm-style — anywhere from four to dozens
of people to a room, usually in bunk beds.
Hostels provide a blanket and pillow and sometimes sheets, but to be
safe, you should bring your own sleeping bag or sleep sack (or expect to
rent sheets from the hostel).
As for the bathrooms: Think of high school gym restrooms or your col-
lege dorm — tiles, a row of sinks, toilet cubicles, and shower stalls,

sometimes spotlessly immaculate, sometimes appallingly grimy. You
may not love it, but it gets the job done.
You can usually get a warm hostel bed for £10 ($19) a night and will
rarely pay more than £20 ($37).
One general resource to check out is www.hostels.com. And if you
know you’ll be taking the backpacking route through Scotland, you may
want to contact the Scottish Youth Hostel Association (% 0870-155-
3255 for reservations or % 01786-891-400 for general inquiries; www.
syha.org.uk).
Security isn’t a major problem in Scotland’s hostels, but it’s something
to consider. Any time you’re sleeping in a room full of strangers, take
precautions to ensure the safety of yourself and your personal belong-
ings. If your hostel doesn’t provide lockers, lock your luggage, if it seems
appropriate, or make your bags as difficult to get into as possible. Also,
bring your wallet, passport, purse, and any other valuables into bed
with you for safekeeping.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the standard rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the rate
you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night —
and thus it represents in most cases the highest rate.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a
room depends on many factors.
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may result in a
lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the central
reservations number may not know about discount rates available at
specific locations. Your best bet is to call both the local number and toll-
free number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy rates
rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are subject to
change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be different
from the actual rate you receive when you make your reservation. 
Remember, in Scotland, accommodation rates fall from about the begin-
ning of October until Christmas and New Years (when they jump up to
high season prices for a couple of weeks), and then they stay more
affordable until mid-March or Easter time. Some of the nicer country
house hotels close entirely in January. See Chapter 3 for a discussion of
Scotland’s high and low travel seasons. If you think you want a package
tour that includes accommodation, flip to Chapter 6.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 99

Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Independent Internet hotel booking agencies representing hotels and
guesthouses in Scotland have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of
late, and it’s the best way to get a reduced price for a room. Such com-
petitiveness can be a boon to consumers who have the patience and
time to shop and compare the online sites for good deals — but shop
you must, for prices can vary considerably from site to site. And keep in
mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listing may be there for no other
reason than that they paid money to get the placement.
Of the “big three” sites, Expedia offers a long list of special deals and
“virtual tours” or photos of available rooms that allow you to see what
you’re paying for. Travelocity posts unvarnished customer reviews 
and ranks its properties according to the AAA rating system. Also reli-
able are Hotels.com and Quikbook.com. An excellent free program,
TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), helps you search multiple hotel sites
at once, and conveniently lists the total price of the room, including the
taxes and service charges. It’s a good idea to get a confirmation number
and make a printout of any online booking transaction you make.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of the hotel you want before offering up your
money. (However, as with all opaque Web sites, the name of the hotel is
not revealed until you pay.) Priceline is much better at getting five-star
lodging for three-star prices than at finding anything at the bottom of the
scale. On the downside, many hotels stick Priceline guests in their least
desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the BiddingforTravel Web site (www.
biddingfortravel.com) before bidding; it features a fairly up-to-date
list of hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and
Hotwire, you pay up front and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some
hotels don’t provide loyalty program credits or points or other frequent-
stay amenities when you book a room through opaque online services.

scotland.com or www.hotelreviewscotland.com. If you’re looking 
for something more unusual, you may want to consider a farm stay; you

cotland’s population is generally a friendly one that welcomes visi-

provides basic advice to help make your trip successful for everyone
involved.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Scotland may not top the list of countries that ease the burden of travel-
ing with children, but it is getting better. Some posh country house
hotels actually discourage families with children and/or prohibit tod-
dlers from the dining room at night. Throughout this book, I’ve flagged
(with the kid-friendly icon) those spots that are particularly appealing
prospects for families.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet at

path tours and tour operators for families

takes the whole family, including kids ages 8 to 15, on moderately priced
domestic and international learning vacations. A team of academics
leads lectures, field trips, and sightseeing excursions.
To help ensure a peaceful trip with children in tow, take care of a few
preliminaries before lift-off.
 Check what your children have packed. You want to make sure that
they have the clothes necessary for any changes in the weather
and make sure they haven’t over-packed.
 Bring a few toys for younger children, but nothing that can’t be
replaced if it’s lost along the way.
 Music and even books on tape or CD are great diversions. Small
games work well for those times when the scenery isn’t sufficiently
engaging. Having a deck of cards handy is a good idea for restau-
rant visits.
Getting to Scotland and exploring with kids
Remember, each child, regardless of age, is expected to have a passport.
Some airlines offer child-companion fares and have a children’s menu
upon request.
Car-rental companies in Scotland will provide necessary car seats, and
all vehicles have rear seatbelts. The law requires that children be buck-
led in no matter whether they’re in the front or back seats.
Keep in mind that most attractions and some public transportation
options offer reduced prices for children. And most attractions, even
places that don’t seem particularly family-oriented, offer family group
prices (usually for two adults and two or three children).

For the female traveler
Scotland very well could be, in general, a safer place than most for people traveling
alone — especially women — but be careful not to be lulled into a false sense of secu-
rity. To find out more about safety for women travelers, pick up a copy of Safety and
Security for Women Who Travel, by Sheila Swan Laufer and Peter Laufer (Travelers’
Tales Guides), which caters to the concerns of the female traveler.

Finding a family-friendly hotel
Contact your hotel, guesthouse, or B&B before you go to find out about
potential cost-cutting accommodations for families with children. Many
times, an extra cot for a child is just a small additional cost — a welcome
exception to the per-person pricing standard in Scotland. Also, some
places have a baby-sitter list in case you opt for a grown-ups’ night out.
Making Age Work for You: Advice for Seniors
Most of the paid attractions in Scotland offer discounts (tickets called
concessions) to senior citizens (“pensioners” or “OAPs” — which stands
for old age pensioners — in local lingo). Most public transportation is
less costly for older people, too, although local service may require a
special ID that’s too much of a bother to obtain if you’re only in town for
a day or two. People older than age 60 usually qualify for reduced admis-
sion to theaters, museums, and other attractions as well as discounted
fares on public transportation. Hotels may offer discounts for seniors. 
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), are eligible for discounts on hotels, air-
fares, and car rentals.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study
programs in more than 80 countries around the world for those ages 55
and older (and a companion of any age). Most courses last for two to
four weeks abroad, and many include airfare, modest accommodations,
meals, and tuition.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts 
for seniors include: the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures
for the Mature Traveler (Avalon); 101 Tips for Mature Travelers,
available from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-221-2610 or 617-350-7500;
www.gct.com); The 50+ Traveler’s Guidebook (St. Martin’s Press); and
Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You Absolutely
Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 50, by Joann Rattner Heilman (McGraw-
Hill).
Many senior-targeted tours of Scotland are of the tour-bus variety, with
free trips thrown in for those who organize groups of 20 or more. If
you’re seeking more independent travel, you should probably consult 
a regular travel agent to make your travel plans (see Chapter 6).
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 103

Accessing Scotland: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling. Scotland’s cities
are reasonably well equipped to accommodate those with disabilities.
However, not everything in Scotland will be easy. Many train stations are
decidedly inaccessible and historical attractions, such as castles, by their
very nature, with cobblestone stairs, are difficult for even some able-
bodied visitors to navigate. Some B&Bs and small hotels with lots of stairs
and no elevators aren’t suitable, either. Recently, Scotland toughened its
rules on access for those with disabilities, so matters are improving. 
You can call ahead to attractions and B&Bs to check their facilities, but
you can feel fairly confident that newer restaurants and modern hotels
will be entirely accessible.
The “Information for Visitors with Disabilities” guide, published by the
National Trust of Scotland, is available at most tourist offices. It lists
attractions in Scotland and details the accessibility of each portion of
the attraction (for example, the castle may be accessible but the gardens
and toilets may not be). The publication even details access points and
views that are accessible from a wheelchair.
Travel agencies and organizations
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities.
 Access-Able Travel Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.
com) offers extensive information on accessibility and advice for
traveling around the world with disabilities.
 Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.

Following the Rainbow: Advice 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Although not considered the most liberally-minded country in Europe,
Scotland is safe for gay and lesbian travelers. Glasgow and Edinburgh
are progressive cities that are home to substantial (though perhaps 
subdued, depending on what you’re used to) gay populations. Smaller
towns and villages may be less tolerant, and open displays of affection
may be frowned upon. Hotels should not discriminate against same sex
couples.
For more information and support, contact the Gay and Lesbian
Switchboard (% 0141-847-0447) in Glasgow, which also operates the
LGBT Centre (% 0141-221-7203). The line offers health advice, work-
shops, and cultural events in the community. On the Web, visit www.
eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/blogs, which is run by Edinburgh
University’s Bisexual, Lesbian, Gay, or Transgendered Society.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-

series.
 Out and About (% 800-929-2268 or 415-644-8044; www.outand

Uncovering Your Scottish Roots
If you have a surname beginning with Mac (which simply means “son
of”) or one of the common lowland Scottish monikers from Burns to
Armstrong, you’re probably a descendant of Scots and may have ties 
to a clan — a group of kinsmen with common ancestry.
Clans and clan societies maintain their own museums throughout
Scotland, and local tourist offices can give you details about where 
to locate them. Bookstores here also sell clan histories and maps.
Genealogical records are kept at the General Register Office for
Scotland, New Register House, 3 W. Register St., Edinburgh (% 0131-
334-0380; www.gro-scotland.gov.uk), where you can search for a fee.
The system is strictly self-service, and the office gets very crowded in
summer.
The official government source for genealogical data has also been
added to the Web. Log on to www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk. A basic
search through the computerized archive costs £6 (about $11). The Web
site’s census data goes back more than 100 years.

efore heading off to Scotland, you need to take care of some impor-
tant business. The information I provide in this chapter should
help you get all your ducks in a row.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without one. Getting a
passport is fairly easy, but the process takes some time, so you need to
plan ahead. For an up-to-date country-by-country listing of passport
requirements around the world, go to http://travel.state.gov/
travel/foreignentryreqs.html, which is maintained by the U.S.
Department of State.
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps.
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport office; 
a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office. Whether
you’re applying in person or by mail, you can download passport
applications from the U.S. Department of State Web site at http://
travel.state.gov. To find your regional passport office, either
check the Department of State Web site or call the National Passport
Information Center (% 877-487-2778) for automated information.

2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship. (Bringing
along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or social security
card is also a good idea.)
3. Submit two identical passport-sized photos, measuring 2 x 2 inches
in size. A variety of businesses, including pharmacies and major
post offices, take these photos.
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and older, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs $85. For those 15 and younger, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $70.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes three weeks but can take longer during busy periods
(especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were older than age 16 when it was issued), you
can renew the passport by mail for $55. Whether you’re applying in
person or by mail, you can download passport applications from the
U.S. Department of State Web site at http://travel.state.gov/
passport/index.html. For general information, call the National
Passport Agency (% 202-647-0518).
Applying for other passports
The following list contains passport information for citizens of Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free from
Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on how
and where to apply.
 Canadians can pick up applications at travel agencies throughout
Canada or from the central Passport Office, Department of
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3 
(% 800-567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications must be accom-
panied by two identical passport-sized photographs and proof of
Canadian citizenship. Processing takes five to ten days if you apply
in person or three weeks by mail.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download it from the main office’s Web
site, www.passports.govt.nz. For information, contact Passports
Office at % 0800-225-050 or visit the Web site.

Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available to you: trip-cancellation
insurance, medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost of
travel insurance varies widely depending on the cost and length of your
trip, your age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect
to pay between 5 percent and 8 percent of the cost of the vacation itself.
For more information on travel insurance, contact one of the following
insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com)
or Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-
insurance.com).
Trip-cancellation insurance
Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you have
to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your travel sup-
plier goes bankrupt. Permissible reasons for cancellation can range from
sickness to natural disasters to the department of state declaring your
destination unsafe for travel. 
A good resource for information on trip-cancellation and travel-related
scams is Travel Guard Alerts, a list of companies considered high-risk
by Travel Guard International (www.travelguard.com). Protect yourself
further by paying for trip-cancellation insurance with a credit card — 
by law, a consumer can get his money back on goods and services not
received if he paid with a credit card and reports the loss within 60 days
after the charge is listed on his credit card statement.
Many tour operators include insurance in the cost of the trip or can
arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a convenient
and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain insurance. Make
sure the tour company is a reputable one, however: Some experts sug-
gest you avoid buying insurance from the tour or cruise company you’re
traveling with, saying it’s better to buy from a third-party insurer than to
put all your money in one place.
Medical insurance
For travel overseas, most health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid)
don’t provide coverage; those that do often require you to pay for serv-
ices up front and will only reimburse you after you’ve returned home and
filed the necessary paperwork. In Scotland, health care is nationalized and
free to residents. The hospital’s emergency rooms will treat anyone at no
cost, regardless of whether you’re a local or a tourist. For stays in the hos-
pital and follow-up care, however, they will seek payment. As a safety net,
you may want to buy travel medical insurance. If you require additional
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 109

medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance (% 410-453-6300; www.medex
assist.com) or Travel Assistance International (% 800-821-2828;
www.travelassistance.com).
Lost luggage insurance
On international flights (including U.S. portions of international trips),
baggage coverage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound, up to
approximately $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items more
valuable than what’s covered by the standard liability, see if your home-
owner’s policy covers your valuables, get baggage insurance as part of
your comprehensive travel-insurance package, or buy Travel Guard’s
“BagTrak” product. I would not suggest buying insurance at the airport —
it’s usually overpriced.
Be sure to take any valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your
carry-on luggage, because many valuables (including books, money, and
electronics) aren’t covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the air-
port, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must report
delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival. Airlines
are required to deliver found luggage directly to your house or destina-
tion free of charge.
Staying Healthy When You Travel
You don’t need any special inoculations or shots to travel in Scotland.
The threat of bird flu will continue to be debated, but any risks to you
from either live poultry or wild bird populations will be miniscule. 
If you have a serious and/or chronic illness, talk to your doctor before
leaving on a trip. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137; www.
iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in Scotland and lists
of local doctors. Also, the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (% 800-311-3435; www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date infor-
mation on health hazards by region or country and offers tips on food
safety. The Web site www.tripprep.com, sponsored by a consortium 
of travel medicine practitioners, may also offer helpful advice on travel-
ing abroad. You can find listings of reliable clinics overseas at the
International Society of Travel Medicine (www.istm.org).
In Scotland, health care is nationalized and free. Hospital emergency
rooms will treat anyone, regardless of whether they’re local residents or
tourists.

Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Staying in touch while traveling is easier than ever, thanks to cellphones
and the Internet. Of course, if what you’re interested in is an escape, you
may want to skip the section below. Otherwise, read on.
Using a cellphone outside the U.S.
First of all, they’re called “mobiles” (moe-biles) in Scotland. The three
letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities are GSM
(Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that makes for
easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and dozens of other
countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, and Cingular
use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell, and some Rogers
customers are GSM, and all Europeans and most Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across much of the globe, from
Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless operator and ask for interna-
tional roaming to be activated on your account. Unfortunately, per-
minute charges on the network can be high.
If you have an unlocked phone — one that allows you to install remov-
able computer memory phone chips (called SIM cards) — you can
switch over to a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer) in
Scotland. (Show your phone to the salesperson when you go to buy a
SIM card; not all phones work on all networks.) With the new card, you
get a local phone number and much, much lower calling rates. If your
phone is locked, you may be able to have it unlocked. Just call your cel-
lular operator and say you’ll be going abroad and want to use the phone
with a local provider.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 111
Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis (or, as it’s known in the world of flying, “economy-class syn-
drome”) is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition
that can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin —
for too long. During a flight (especially a long one), get up, walk around, and stretch
your legs every 60 to 90 minutes. Other things you can do to prevent deep vein throm-
bosis include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water, and avoid-
ing alcohol and sleeping pills. If you have a history of deep vein thrombosis, heart
disease, or another condition that puts you at high risk for deep vein thrombosis, some
experts recommend wearing compression stockings or taking anticoagulants when
you fly; always ask your physician about the best course of action for you. Symptoms
of deep vein thrombosis include leg pain or swelling, or even shortness of breath.

If you don’t have a cellphone, or if your phone is locked, then renting a
phone is another possibility. Although you can rent a phone from any
number of overseas sites, including kiosks at airports and at car-rental
agencies, I suggest renting the phone before you leave home. That way
you can give loved ones and business associates your new number,
make sure the phone works, and take the phone wherever you go.
Getting the phone before you leave is especially helpful if you’re plan-
ning to visit Scotland and then go overseas through several other coun-
tries, where local phone-rental agencies often bill in local currency and
may not let you take the phone to another country.
Phone rental isn’t cheap. You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per week, plus 
airtime fees of at least $1 per minute. If you’re traveling to the U.K. or
Europe, though, local rental companies often offer free incoming calls
within their home country, which can save you big bucks. Shop around.
Two good wireless rental companies in the States are InTouch Global
(% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888-
290-1606 or 905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com). Give the company your
itinerary, and someone will tell you what wireless products you need.
For no charge, InTouch also advises you on whether your existing phone
will work overseas; simply call % 703-222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 
4 p.m. EST, or go to http://intouchglobal.com/travel.htm.
In the U.K., you can rent (or “hire”) phones from
 Cellhire UK (% 0800-610-610 within the U.K., % 44-1904-610-610
outside the U.K., or % 1-866-246-6546 within the U.S.; www.cell
hire.co.uk)
 Adam Phones (% 0800-123-000 within the U.K.; % 44-20-8742-
0101 outside the U.K., or % 1-866-GSM-HIRE within the U.S.; www.
adamphones.com)
Accessing the Internet
Travelers have any number of ways to check e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA
(personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a modem — 
provides the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you
can access e-mail and even your office computer from cybercafes.
It’s hard nowadays to find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes.
Although no definitive directory for cybercafes exists — these are inde-
pendent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are at www.
cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com. In Scotland, cybercafes
pop up near universities more than anywhere else.
Aside from cybercafes, most youth hostels and an increasing number of
hotels and B&Bs have at least one computer you can use to access the
Internet. Many public libraries in Scotland offer Internet access free or
for a small charge. Most major airports have Internet kiosks scattered
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
112

throughout their terminals, too. These give you Web access for a per-
minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices. Avoid hotel busi-
ness centers unless you’re willing to pay exorbitant rates.
If you need to access files on your office computer while you’re away,
look into a service called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service
provides a Web-based interface for you to access and manipulate a dis-
tant PC from anywhere — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC
is on and has an always-on connection to the Internet (such as with digi-
tal cable).
Using your own computer
If you’re bringing your own computer with you, more and more hotels,
cafes, and retailers are signing on as Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) “hotspots.”
Mac owners have their own networking technology: Apple AirPort.
Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set
up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. IPass providers
also give you access to a few hundred wireless hotel lobby setups. To
locate other hotspots that provide free wireless networks in cities
around the world, go to www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/
WirelessCommunities.
For dial-up access, most business-class hotels throughout the world
offer dataports for laptop modems. In addition, major Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) have local access numbers around the world, allowing
you to go online by placing a local call. The iPass network also has dial-
up numbers around the world. You’ll have to sign up with an iPass
provider, who will then tell you how to set up your computer for your
destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and
click on “Individuals Buy Now.” One solid provider is i2roam (www.
i2roam.com; % 866-811-6209 or 920-235-0475).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Scotland Unplugged: Getting 
Your Electric Stuff to Work
The plugs in Scotland are different than in the U.S. and Canada. You can
buy a cheap adapter, but it won’t address the problem of different volt-
ages. In the U.S. and Canada, the current is 120 volts. In Scotland, it’s offi-
cially 230 volts, although 240 volts are common. If you plug in your hair
dryer, even with an adapter, you’re likely to blow a fuse or burn out the
appliance. You can buy a voltage transformer (check out www.walkabout
travelgear.com), but they can be expensive and not worth the cost if
you’re planning a short stay.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 113

Some travel appliances, such as shavers and irons, have a nice feature
called dual voltage that adapts to the change, but unless your appliance
gives a voltage range (such as 110v–220v), don’t chance it. Bring a 
battery-operated alarm clock (for when you can’t get a wake-up call) 
and shaver (if you’re averse to disposables) as well as a battery-
powered personal stereo (if you can’t bear to be without your tunes).
And don’t forget extra batteries.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
Generally, arriving at the airport three hours before an international
flight remains the best advice given the heightened security these days.
At the U.K. end, security at Heathrow is very tight, while in Scotland it at
least appears more relaxed. 
In 2003, gate check-in was phased out at all U.S. airports. And e-tickets
have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. With an e-ticket, you can beat
the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online
check-in from your home computer.
If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the credit card you used to
book the flight or your frequent-flier card. (You may not be able to print
out your boarding pass without the credit card used for purchase, and
you want to make sure your frequent-flier miles are credited.) Print out
your boarding pass from the kiosk and proceed to the security check-
point with your pass and photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to
get an exit-row seat, you can do so using most airline kiosks.
You can speed up security by not wearing or carrying dense metal
objects, such as big belt buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a
doctor’s note can prevent a long chat with the security screeners. 
Federal rules dictate what you can carry on a plane and what you can’t.
The broad rule is that all sharp objects are out, even nail clippers. And
in 2006, foods and liquids were essentially banned as well, unless within
small containers and carried in clear plastic bags — or purchased at
shops within the secured zone. 
Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag (check for current size
restrictions), plus a personal item. It has become much more difficult for
those carry-on hoarders to stuff all sorts of things into an oversized bag
in order to avoid checking luggage. While I once would have advised you
to chance it, I now think that it is probably best to store everything —
except for what is essential during the flight — into your checked lug-
gage. Check the U.S. Transportation Security Administration Web site
(www.tsa.gov) for details and updates.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
114

Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage
inspectors with a special code or key. For more information on the locks,
visit www.travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-
approved locks, your lock may be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent
needs to hand-search your luggage.

Part III
Edinburgh and
Glasgow

In this part . . .
You ﬁnd out about the charms and attractions of
Scotland’s two major cities, Edinburgh and Glasgow, and
about some of the sights that are within easy striking dis-
tance of each or both of the cities. Though noticeably differ-
ent from one another, each city is worth a visit, and you’ll ﬁnd
plenty of suggestions here of what to do and see. Edinburgh,
Scotland’s capital, is most famous for its castle and pictur-
esque setting, while Glasgow, once one of the greatest ship-
building centers of the world, is a more modern and bustling
big city (though not too big).
The chapters in Part III offer everything from advice on get-
ting there to getting around — as well as hints on how to dis-
cover the best places to stay and dine. You also get the
lowdown on the cities’ ﬁnest sights and attractions, insider
tips on quintessential Scottish pubs and cafes, and a walking
tour in each city.

E
dinburgh has been called one of Europe’s fairest cities and the
“Athens of the North.” And what many experienced travelers to the
U.K. say is true: If you can visit only two cities in all Great Britain, it’s
London first and Edinburgh second. Built on extinct volcanoes near an
inlet from the North Sea (the Firth of Forth) and enveloped by rolling 
hills, lakes, and forests, the Scottish capital began as a small, fortified 
settlement on a craggy hill. Indeed, because of its defensive attributes,
Edinburgh (remember “burgh” is always pronounced burra in Scotland)
became an important, protected place for the country’s rulers. Somewhat
ironically, the city today represents the virtual crossroads of Scotland for
many visitors: the spot that they are most likely to stop in or pass through
while in Scotland.
Edinburgh is filled with historic, intellectual, and literary associations.
Names such as Mary Queen of Scots and her nemesis, the Protestant
reformer John Knox; pioneer economist Adam Smith and philosopher
David Hume; authors Sir Walter Scott, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle; as well as inventor Alexander Graham Bell: They
are all part of Edinburgh’s past.
Today the city is famous for its annual world-class cultural event: the
Edinburgh Festival. It is actually several festivals at once: films, books,
comedy, drama, classical music, dance, and more. But this ancient seat
of Scottish royalty has year-round attractions: When the festival-goers
have returned home, the city’s pace is more relaxed, its prices are lower,
and the inhabitants — though not celebrated for their bonhomie — are
under less pressure and offer a hospitable welcome.
Edinburgh is a city that lends itself to walking. Its Old Town and New
Town are full of moody cobbled alleys, elegant streetscapes, handsome

squares, and placid parks. From several hilltops, panoramic views can
be enjoyed. 
Beyond being Scotland’s political center, Edinburgh was also its cultural
capital, even if that particular crown — in terms of contemporary 
culture — has perhaps been lost to Glasgow (see Chapter 12) over the
last few decades. Nevertheless, the Scottish capital is still lively. It is
home to the country’s several national galleries. And its location pro-
vides the perfect point for excursions. Notable nearby attractions
include Linlithgow, where Mary Queen of Scots was born, and attractive
seaside villages, such as North Berwick, east of Edinburgh. (Turn to
Chapter 13 for more information on day-trip options.) Any visit to
Scotland should try to give Edinburgh at least two days — and, if you
have the time, you won’t regret staying longer.
Getting to Edinburgh
Although there are a few direct flights to Edinburgh from North America,
a stopover in London’s Heathrow airport (or some other European hub)
is probably more common. If you’re coming north from London, your
options include taking the train. If you’re coming from elsewhere in
Scotland, major bus and railway routes serve Edinburgh. Having a car
within the city of Edinburgh isn’t strictly necessary (nor indeed even
preferable). But the city is easily reached via freeways and highways, if
you choose to drive.
By air
Edinburgh is only about an hour’s flying time from London, which is
633km (393 miles) south. Edinburgh International Airport (% 0131-
333-1000) is about 10km (6 miles) west of the city’s center, and has
become a growing hub for flights both within the British Isles and to 
and from Continental Europe.
Remember, however, that Glasgow International Airport is only about
90km (55 miles) away and shouldn’t be discounted if you’re coming to
Edinburgh, because it traditionally greets more long-haul flights, espe-
cially from North America. For information on arriving in Glasgow by air,
see Chapter 12.
Orienting yourself
Edinburgh’s airport is small (about the length of two football fields) and
contained in one terminal, so there’s little possibility of getting lost.
Immigration control and customs agents are vigilant, but the scene is
quite a bit more relaxed than at a giant air terminal such as London’s
Heathrow. Usually you find just one line (or queue, in local parlance) 
for visitors from outside the European Union. Before heading into town,
you may want to stop at the airport’s VisitScotland information and
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
120

accommodation desk (% 0131-473-3800), which is generally open
Monday through Saturday from 6:15 a.m. to 7:45 p.m. and Sunday from 
9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Getting into town
From Edinburgh airport, the Airlink bus makes the trip to the city center
about every ten minutes during peak times, terminating at Waverley
Bridge near the central railway station. The fare is £3 ($5.55) one-way 
or £5 ($9.25) round-trip. The trip from the airport into town takes about
25 minutes (sometimes longer during rush hour). Overnight service is
provided by the Night Bus: N22. Visit www.flybybus.com for details of
Airlink bus service.
A taxi into the city costs about £12 ($22) or more, depending on traffic,
and the ride takes about the same amount of time as the bus. Look for
the taxi stand when exiting the airport.
By train
The trains that link London to Edinburgh (via Newcastle) on the so-called
East Coast Main Line are reasonably fast, efficient, and generally relaxing,
with a restaurant and bar service as well as air-conditioning. Trains
depart from London’s King’s Cross Station (contact National Railway
Enquiries at % 0845-748-4950 for rail info; www.nationalrail.co.uk)
every hour or so and arrive in Edinburgh at Waverley Station in the heart
of the city. The trip generally takes four and a half hours. 
Off-peak fares bought in advance can range widely, from around £25 to
£93 ($46–$172) and the government is examining whether they should
be less variable. Off-peak first-class tickets purchased in advance also
range widely, from about £30–£100 ($56–$185), although the cheapest
fares seem to be rarely available. A fully flexible “buy anytime, travel
anytime” standard open single fare is upwards of £120 ($222). The
Caledonian Sleeper service for overnight travel can cost about £100
($185), but online bargains booked well in advance can mean the trip
may cost as little at £19 ($35). Taxi and bus connections are easily made
at Waverley Station, which also serves Glasgow with a shuttle service
every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes in the evening
until about 11:30 p.m. The one-way fare during off-peak times (for travel
after 9:15 a.m. and not from 4:15 a.m.–6:30 p.m.) is £8.80 ($16).
By bus
The journey from London to Edinburgh by bus can take up to ten hours.
Nevertheless, it gets you there for only about £40 ($74) round-trip.
Scottish CityLink coaches depart from London’s Victoria Coach Station
and deliver you to Edinburgh’s Bus Station near St. Andrew Square 
(% 0870-550-5050 for information).
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 121

By car
Edinburgh is 74km (46 miles) east of Glasgow and 169km (105 miles)
north of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England. No express motorway links
London directly to Edinburgh. The M1 from London takes you most of
the way north, but you have to come into Edinburgh via secondary
roads — either the coastal A1 or inland A68. Alternatively, you can travel
the well-used motorways in the west of the U.K. From London, take the
M1 to the M6 (near Coventry), which links to the M74 at Carlisle. Then
travel to the M8 southeast of Glasgow, which takes you Edinburgh’s ring
road or beltway. Allow 8 hours or more for the drive north from London.
Orienting Yourself in Edinburgh
Central Edinburgh is divided into two historic districts: the Old Town
and a larger New Town. Old Town, once called “Auld Reekie” because of
its smoky atmosphere, is today chock-a-block with tourist attractions
and shops, its sidewalks often full of out-of-town visitors from Easter
until autumn. New Town represents a golden age of Edinburgh, display-
ing mid–to-late-18th-century modernism in town planning, as well as
reflecting the age of enlightenment.
The Royal Mile is the main thoroughfare in Old Town, running from
Edinburgh Castle in the west to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in the east.
Both British royalty and Scotland’s Parliament (revived in 1999) are
based in the Old Town, as is municipal government and the country’s
legal elite. Another more infamous street at the southern base of the
castle is the Grassmarket, both a street and a district, where convicted
criminals were once hanged on the gallows. Today it’s home to restau-
rants, pubs, and hotels.
New Town is actually fairly old. North of Old Town, across what is today
Princes Street Gardens, it was first settled in the 18th century. By the
beginning of the 19th century, classic squares, streets, and town houses
were complete, and the original district was soon expanded with more
Georgian designs. Princes Street is the area’s primary shopping precinct,
with broad sidewalks and a park running its entire length — all with
panoramic views of Old Town and Edinburgh Castle.
North of and running parallel to Princes Street is New Town’s second
great boulevard, George Street. It begins at St. Andrew Square and runs
west to Charlotte Square. Directly north of George Street is another
impressive thoroughfare, Queen Street, which opens onto Queen Street
Gardens on its north side and features views of the Firth of Forth. You
may also hear a lot about Rose Street, between Princes Street and
George Street, and its many pubs, shops, and restaurants.
Edinburgh’s Southside and West End are primarily residential. The
Southside is home to both the well-regarded Edinburgh University
(which makes parts of the area quite lively) and a sprawling park known
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
122

as the Meadows. The West End includes the last of the New Town devel-
opments begun at the beginning of the 19th century. It has theaters, sev-
eral small B&Bs, and swank boutique hotels as well as the city’s most
exclusive central neighborhoods.
Leith is Edinburgh’s historic port where the Water of Leith meets the Firth
of Forth. It briefly served as the Scottish capital in the middle of the 16th
century, and its strategic location was so strong that Oliver Cromwell’s
invading forces built a citadel there. Leith remained an independent burgh
until the 20th century. Fans of Irvine Welsh (author of Trainspotting) prob-
ably know that the area has a rough and tumble reputation. But today,
most of its shipping and the sailors have gone, and lots of luxury apart-
ments are being built instead. Still, Leith carries reminders of evocative
maritime past and offers a good selection of seafood restaurants and 
nautical-themed pubs. It’s also now the home of the royal yacht Britannia.
Despite the hills, Edinburgh is a very walkable city. Many little alleys
(wynds) and passageways (closes) are accessible only by foot. So bring a
pair of comfortable shoes and start walking — you’ll get a great feel for
what the city has to offer.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Edinburgh has a host of districts, some of which appear to include only
a few streets and many that can be folded into the broader areas of the
Old and New Towns.
Old Town
Old Town is where Edinburgh began. Its spine is the Royal Mile, a
medieval thoroughfare stretching for about 1.6km (1 mile) from
Edinburgh Castle downhill to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The Royal
Mile is one boulevard with four segments bearing different names:
Castlehill, Lawnmarket, High Street, and Canongate. English author
Daniel Defoe wrote of the Royal Mile, “This is perhaps the largest,
longest, and finest street for buildings and number of inhabitants in the
world.” Old Town also includes the areas of Grassmarket and Cowgate.
New Town
Lying predominantly north of Old Town, the first New Town bloomed
between 1766 and 1840 as one of the largest Georgian developments in
the world. It grew to encompass the northern half of the heart of the city.
New Town is the largest historic conservation area in Britain and has at
least 25,000 residents. It is made up of a network of squares, streets, ter-
races, and circuses, reaching from Haymarket in the west almost to Leith
Walk in the east. The neighborhood also extends from Canonmills in the
north to Princes Street, its most famous artery, in the south.
Stockbridge
Today part of the New Town area, Stockbridge is a one-time village that
still feels rather like a small town because of its tightly-knit community.
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 123

Northwest of the castle and straddling the Water of Leigh, it’s a good
place for visitors to the city to relax, especially in the friendly cafes,
pubs, restaurants, and shops.
Haymarket and Dalry
West of the city center by about 1.5km (1 mile), these two districts may
be off the beaten path for most visitors. Haymarket centers on the
Haymarket railway station (an alternative to Waverley for travelers to
and from Glasgow and the west or places much further north). Just a bit
farther out of town is Murrayfield, the Scottish national rugby stadium.
Dalry is slowly opening some interesting though largely neighborhood-
oriented restaurants.
Tollcross and West End
Edinburgh’s theater district and Conference Center are in the area west
of the castle. The West End neighborhoods near Shandwick Place are
rather exclusive. Although the district of Tollcross appears a bit rough,
it’s rapidly changing and becoming more visitor-friendly.
Southside: Marchmont and Bruntsfield
About 1.5km (1 mile) south of High Street, Marchmont was constructed
between 1869 and 1914 to offer new housing to people who could no
longer afford to live in New Town. Its northern border is the Meadows.
Sometimes visitors go south to this neighborhood, seeking an affordable
B&B in one of the little homes that receive guests.
Bruntsfield is west of the Meadows and is named for Bruntsfield Links (a
short-hole public golf course). Now a largely residential district, the area
was the ground on which James IV apparently gathered the Scottish
army that he marched to defeat at Flodden in 1513. You can find many
low-cost B&Bs in this vicinity.
Calton
Encompassing Calton Hill with its Regent and Royal terraces (streets),
this district borders the so-called Pink Triangle, Edinburgh’s version 
of a gay-friendly district. Edinburgh has a lively gay population, which
focuses socially on an area from the top of Leith Walk to Broughton
Street. The area is not, however, a dedicated gay district like San
Francisco’s Castro or Christopher Street in Manhattan’s Greenwich
Village. It’s just part and parcel of lively Calton with its bars, nightclubs,
and restaurants.
Leith Walk and the Port of Leith
Leith Walk isn’t technically a neighborhood but is instead the main
artery that connects Edinburgh’s city center to Leith. Off of it are Easter
Road (home of Hibernian football club) and the districts of Pilrig and
South Leith. A foray down Leith Walk presents you with a true cross sec-
tion of Edinburgh.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
124

The Port of Leith lies only a few kilometers north of Princes Street and
is the city’s major harbor, opening onto the Firth of Forth. In terms of
maritime might, the port isn’t what it used to be; its glory days were
back when stevedores unloaded cargos by hand. The area is currently
experiencing urban renewal, however, and visitors come here for the
pubs and restaurants, many of which specialize in seafood.
Finding information after you arrive
Edinburgh Information Centre, atop the Princes Mall near Waverley
Station (VisitScotland; % 0131-473-3800 or 0845-225-5121; fax: 0131-
473-3881; www.edinburgh.org; Bus: 22, 25, 3, 31, or 8), can give you
sightseeing information and also arrange lodgings. The center sells bus
tours, theater tickets, and souvenirs of Edinburgh. It also has racks and
racks of free brochures. It’s open year-round; typically the hours are
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m., though it is open later during the Festival and closes earlier in
the winter months. 
Getting Around Edinburgh
Because of its narrow lanes, wynds, and closes, you can only honestly
explore the Old Town in any depth on foot. Edinburgh is fairly conven-
ient for the visitor who likes to walk (see the section “Taking a walking
tour,” later in this chapter), because most of the major attractions are
located along the Royal Mile, Princes Street, or one of the major streets
of New Town. The city doesn’t have a subway system, although there
has been discussion about reintroducing a tramway.
By bus
As there is no underground or subway in Edinburgh and only limited
commuter train service, the city’s rather numerous buses provide the
chief method of public transportation. There are lots of them, and most
seem to go down Princes Street as some point on their route.
Fares depend on the distance traveled, with the adult one-way (single)
minimum fare £1 ($1.85) covering the central Edinburgh districts. If you
plan multiple trips in one day, purchase a Dayticket that allows unlim-
ited travel on city buses for one day at a cost of £2.30 ($4.25) adults.
Children between 5 and 15 years old are charged a flat rate of 60p
($1.10), but kids ages 13 to 15 are expected to carry a teen card (avail-
able in bus Travelshops — covered later) as proof of age. Child
Daytickets cost £2 ($3.70). Bus drivers, by the way, will not make
change, so carry the correct amount in coins or expect to pay more.
Children ages four and younger ride free. At Travelshops, one-week
RideaCard passes, which allow unlimited travel on buses, can be pur-
chased for £13 ($24) adult; £11 ($20) student; and £9 ($17) juniors.

Chapter 11: Edinburgh 127

Also the tourist buses that terminate at Waverley Bridge offer hop-on,
hop-off service at any of their stops on the set circuit of primarily Old
and New towns. Tickets — £9 ($17) for adults; £3 ($5.55) for children —
can be used for 24 hours (although the buses’ last journeys are made in
the early evening).
You can get advance tickets and further information in the city center 
at the Waverley Bridge Travelshop, Waverley Bridge, open Monday 
to Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., or at 27
Hanover Street Travelshop, open Monday to Saturday 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
For details on fares and timetables, call % 0131-555-6363 or log on to
www.lothianbuses.co.uk.
By taxi
One way to get around the city is to either hail a taxi or pick one up at a
taxi stand. Meters begin at £2 ($3.70) and a typical trek across town may
cost about £6 ($11). Taxi ranks (stands) are at High Street near South
Bridge, Waverley and Haymarket stations, Hanover Street, North St.
Andrew Street, and Lauriston Place. Fares are displayed on the front of
the taxi, and charges are posted, including extra fees for night drivers 
or destinations outside the city limits. You can also call a taxi ahead 
of time. Try City Cabs at % 0131-228-1211 or Central Radio Taxis at 
% 0131-229-2468.
By car
Unless you absolutely can’t avoid it, I would strongly advise that you
simply don’t drive in Edinburgh — it’s a tricky and frustrating business,
even for natives. Speed bumps, one-way streets, and dedicated bus lanes
are all good reasons to forego the automobile. Parking is expensive and
also can be difficult to find. Metered parking is available, but you need
the right change and have to watch out for traffic wardens who issue tick-
ets. Some zones are marked PERMIT HOLDERS ONLY — and they mean it. Your
vehicle will likely be towed if you don’t have a permit. A double yellow
line along the curb indicates no parking at any time. A single yellow line
along the curb may allow you to park; check for posted restrictions or
you may incur a ticket there as well. Major parking lots (car parks) are at
Castle Terrace (near Edinburgh Castle), Waverley Station, and St James
Centre (close to the east end of Princes Street).
You may want a rental car for touring the countryside or heading
onward. Many agencies grant discounts to those who reserve cars in
advance (see Chapter 7 for more information). Most rental agencies will
accept your foreign driver’s license, provided you’ve held it for more
than a year and are older than age 21. Most of the major car-rental com-
panies maintain offices at the Edinburgh airport in case you want to rent
a car on the spot. In the city, try Avis on West Park Place (% 0870-153-
9103), Hertz on Picardy Place (% 0870-864-0013), or Thrifty on
Haymarket Terrace (% 0131-337-1319).
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
128

By bicycle
Bicycles are a more common mode of transportation in Edinburgh than
in Glasgow. Nevertheless, biking is probably a good idea only for visitors
in good shape, given that the city’s set on a series of ridges and the
streets are often cobbled. If you’re determined to bike your way through
Edinburgh, try Rent-a-Bike Edinburgh, 29 Blackfriars St., near the High
Street (% 0131-556-5560; www.cyclescotland.co.uk; Bus: 35).
Depending on the type of bike you rent, charges average around £15
($28) per day or £70 ($130) for the week, But partial-day hires are also
possible. A credit card imprint will be taken as security. The same com-
pany that operates Rent-a-Bike Edinburgh also runs Scottish Cycle
Safaris, which organizes tours in the city and across Scotland. They can
equip you for excursions, and because they have branches in places
such as Oban, Inverness, and Skye, you can drop off your bike and
equipment there at the end of your trip if it’s more convenient.
On foot
Walking Edinburgh is definitely the best way to see the city center and
most of the town. (But I also recommend using buses or taxis if the dis-
tances seem too great.)
Staying in Style
Edinburgh offers many options for accommodations, from the super-posh
and fabulously pricey five-star hotels to down-and-dirty bunkhouses and
youth hostels. It is a city that anticipates bundles of tourists and travelers,
whether seasonal backpackers, school groups, and families — or profes-
sional types in the Scottish capital on commercial and governmental 
matters. 
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 129
Famous Edinburghers
Famous Edinburgh residents include Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, who has
become one of the best-selling writers in history and wrote her first book in one of the
city’s coffee shops. David Hume lived at James Court in Old Town in the 18th century.
James Boswell, Robert Louis Stevenson, Sir Walter Scott, and Flora MacDonald also
made their homes here. One of the city’s most famous former residents, Sean Connery,
grew up in the Fenton Bridge tenements, and Queen Elizabeth knighted him in 2000 at
the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The actor, most widely known for his many James Bond
films, had previously dismissed the idea of knighthood as long as Scotland was denied
independent rule. (See Chapter 2 for more on the political history of Scotland.)

Chapter 11: Edinburgh 131

Be warned, however. During the month-long period of the Edinburgh
Festival every August, the hotels, guesthouses, and B&Bs fill up. If you’re
planning a visit at that time, be sure to reserve your accommodation as
far in advance as possible. Otherwise you may end up in a town or village
as many as 40km (55 miles) from the city center. And don’t be surprised if
the standard rates for accommodation in Edinburgh are higher — in iso-
lated cases twice as high — during August, particularly at smaller hotels. 
The Edinburgh Information Centre is near Waverley Station, atop the
Princes Mall shopping center, at 3 Princes St. (% 0131-473-3800, 0845-
225-5121, or from overseas dial % 44-1506-832-121; fax: 0131-473-3881;
www.edinburgh.org; Bus: 3, 8, 22, 25, or 31). 
The Information Centre, in conjunction with the Scottish tourist board,
compiles a lengthy list of small hotels, guesthouses, and private homes
providing B&B-type lodging for as little as £25 ($46) per person. A £3
($5.55) booking fee is charged and a 10 percent deposit is expected if you
book through the center. For the best availability, make your reservation
about four weeks in advance, especially during summer. The center is
open year-round; typically the hours are Monday through Saturday from 
9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., although it’s open later
during the Festival and closes earlier in the winter months.
The Scottish tourist board also provides ratings of accommodations,
which are based largely on amenities. Due to the ratings system, the stars
can be limited for smaller operations that may not offer all the modern
conveniences but are still perfectly good places to stay. References to
stars in the information below are those bestowed by VisitScotland.
The Internet can be a treasure trove of discounted rates if you have the
time and inclination to dig around a bit. In some cases, bargains are only
available when you use Web-based booking services. Some of these spe-
cial prices and promotions are noted below. See Chapter 8 for more
details on booking your hotel.
If you have an early flight out and need a hotel that’s convenient to the
airport, consider the 244-unit Edinburgh Marriott, 111 Glasgow Rd. 
(% 0131-334-9191), off A8 on Edinburgh’s western outskirts. It offers
doubles from about £150 ($278), including breakfast. Facilities include 
an indoor pool, gym, sauna, and restaurant.
The top hotels
Here’s a list of my recommended places to stay in Edinburgh. Rack rates
are the standard full prices that a hotel charges for a room. You may not
have to pay the full amount of the published rates, however, except in
high season, and even then there may be reductions. Unless otherwise
indicated, the rates I give include breakfast.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
132

Balmoral Hotel
$$$$
New Town
When it first opened in 1902 as the North British Hotel, it was then — and
remains today — one of the grandest hotels in Britain. Known as the
Balmoral since the early ’90s, the rooms received a £7-million ($13-million)
refurbishment not long ago. Almost directly above the Waverley Rail
Station, the building features a soaring clock tower that is one of the city’s
landmarks, famously set five minutes fast for the benefit of those on the
way to the train. Kilted doormen supply the Scottish atmosphere from the
start. Sumptuously furnished, the best of the units — such as room 520, the
Dee Suite — can be distinguished and large, with an ample sitting room and
huge, well-appointed bathroom, not to mention fabulous views towards the
castle. There is a spa, pool, and 24-hour room service, while dining options
include the elegant and Michelin-star-earning Number One and the more
casual Hadrian’s Brasserie. Afternoon tea is served in the high-ceilinged
Palm Court. In addition to the standard rates, the hotel’s Web site offers
“Simply Balmoral” seasonal discounts among other package deals.
See map p. 130. 1 Princes St. % 800-223-6800 in the U.S., or % 0131-556-2414. Fax:
0131-557-3747. www.thebalmoralhotel.com. Bus: 3, 8, 22, 25, 30. Rack rates:
£225–£290 ($416–$537) double; £245–£310 ($453–$574) superior double; from £465
($860) suite. AE, DC, MC, V.
The Bonham
$$$$
New Town
One of Edinburgh’s most stylish hotels, the Bonham is actually three con-
nected West End town houses that functioned in the 19th century as a
nursing home and more recently as dorms for the university. In 1998, all
that changed when a team of entrepreneurs poured millions of pounds into
its refurbishment, pumped up the design, and outfitted each high-ceilinged
guest room in a hip blend of old and new. Perhaps the jewel in the crown
of the Townhouse group of hotels in Edinburgh, the Bonham’s rooms each
have an individual theme and plush upholsteries. Bathrooms are state of
the art, with expensive toiletries. The Restaurant at the Bonham provides
elegant yet modern dining rooms. In addition to the standard rates, mid-

Caledonian Hilton Edinburgh
$$$$
New Town
This hotel remains one of the city’s landmarks and offers commanding
views towards the nearby Edinburgh Castle and over Princes Street
Gardens. The public rooms are reminiscent of Edwardian splendor, and
the guest rooms (some of which are exceptionally spacious and others
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 133

quite small) are rather conservatively styled with reproduction furniture.
Bathrooms come with combination tub/showers. Fine-dining meals are
served in the Pompadour Restaurant. A traditional tea is featured in the
high-ceilinged lounge. On the Internet, advance booking reaps dividends.

Channings
$$$
Near New Town
Five Edwardian terrace houses were combined to create this hotel, located
near Stockbridge in a tranquil residential area. Channings maintains the
atmosphere of a Scottish country house, with oak paneling, ornate fire-
places, molded ceilings, and antiques. The guest rooms are outfitted in a
modern style; the front units get the views, but the rear ones offer more
seclusion. The most desirable rooms are the “Executives,” most of which
have bay windows and wingback chairs. Even if you’re not a guest, con-
sider a meal here; Channings Restaurant offers fine fare.

The Edinburgh Residence
$$$$
West End
Part of the Townhouse group (which includes the Bonham, Howard, and
Channings), this is one of the finest luxury hotels in Scotland, a series of
elegant suites installed in a trio of architecturally beautiful and sensitively
restored Georgian buildings in the West End. As you enter, grand staircases
and classic wood paneling greet you, but the units have all the modern
conveniences that befit five-star accommodation. The rooms are the ulti-
mate in comfort, with a trio of suites having their own private entrances.
All units are spacious. Again, if you are traveling off season, it is worth
inquiring about “short break” promotions that offer savings.

The Howard
$$$$
New Town
Dubbed one of the most exclusive five-star hotels in the city, this lovely
hotel is made up of a set of linked Georgian terraced houses in the Northern
New Town, just down the hill from the Queen Street Gardens. Some of the
aura of a private home remains. Accommodations are midsize to spacious;
units are individually and rather elegantly decorated, with some of the best
bathrooms in town — featuring power and double showers and, in some,

Jacuzzis. The décor is traditional and modern, incorporating both antiques
and reproductions. Service is a hallmark of The Howard, with a dedicated
butler who can tend to your individual needs — even unpacking your lug-
gage, should you so desire.

Malmaison
$$$
Leith
This is Leith’s stylish boutique hotel, located in the old harbor district,
only a few steps from the Water of Leith. Malmaison was converted from
an 1883 seamen’s mission/dorm and is capped by a stately stone clock
tower. Overall, it’s a hip, unpretentious place with a minimalist décor.
Rooms are average in size but well equipped. The leisure facilities are lim-
ited to an exercise room, but you’ll find the brasserie and wine bar favored
by locals. Even during summertime, at least before the Festival begins,
Malmaison’s online reservation offers good discounts.

Prestonfield
$$$$
Southside
Prestonfield, rising in Jacobean splendor amid 5.3 hectares (13 acres) of
gardens, pastures, and woodlands below Arthur’s Seat, underwent a £3-
million ($5.5-million) refurbishment in 2003 and is now in the hands of
James Thomson, who owns The Witchery (see listing later in this section).
The pile was built in the 17th century, serving first as the home of the city’s
Lord Provost (mayor), and has entertained a varied group of luminaries
over the years from David Hume and Benjamin Franklin to pop stars and
actors such as Sean Connery and Minnie Driver. Guests appreciate the tra-
ditional atmosphere and 1680s architecture as well as the peacocks and
Highland cattle that strut and stroll across the grounds. The spacious bed-
rooms (bestowed five-stars by the tourist board) hide all mod conven-
iences (such as Bose sound systems, DVD players, and plasma, flat-screen
TVs) behind velvet-lined walls. The restaurant, Rhubarb, is as theatrical
as they come, with plush furnishings and décor to match the mansion.
Reduced midweek rates are sometimes available.

The Scotsman
$$$–$$$$
Old Town
Only minutes from the Royal Mile or Princes Street, this is one of the
brightest and most stylish hotels to open in Edinburgh recently. Its name
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 135

honors the newspaper that was published here for nearly a century before
relocating to modern facilities near Holyroodhouse. Traditional styling and
cutting-edge design are harmoniously wed in the 1904 baronial limestone
pile, a city landmark since it was first constructed. The 68 units, from the
Study Room to the Baron Suite, vary in size (from 300 sq. ft. to a whopping
1,110 sq. ft.) and aspect, such as views of the castle or towards Calton Hill
and Firth of Forth. They include state-of-the-art bathrooms and such extras
as two-way service closets, which means your laundry can be picked up
virtually unnoticed. The two-floor penthouse suite is in a category of its
own, with a private elevator and balcony with barbecue. The in-house
dining options include the smart North Bridge Brasserie & Bar as well as
the more exclusive fine-dining option in the basement, Vermilion. In addi-
tion to standard rates, there are weekend break promotions.

Sheraton Grand Hotel
$$$$
West End
On the grounds of a former railway siding near Edinburgh’s Usher Hall,
Traverse, and Royal Lyceum theatres, this six-story postmodern structure
houses a glamorous hotel and office complex. The Sheraton is elegant, with
soaring public rooms and rich carpeting. Boasting a good location in the
proverbial shadow of Edinburgh Castle — as well as state-of-the-art spa and
leisure facilities (including a roof-top indoor/outdoor pool) — the hotel
pretty much has it all. The spacious, well-furnished units have double-
glazed windows, and glamorous suites are available as are rooms for trav-
elers with disabilities. The castleview rooms on the top floors are best (and
most expensive). The main restaurant, with views of the Festival Square,
presents well-prepared meals and a lavish Sunday buffet, while an annex
houses the Italian restaurant Santini (see “Dining out”) below the spa.

The Walton
$$–$$$
New Town
A real discovery, this ten-room guesthouse sits right at the heart of
Edinburgh’s northern New Town in a well-restored 200-year-old town house.
A complete refurbishment and renovation has maintained the essential
Georgian character and elegant features, but also revitalized and modern-
ized the entire hotel. Bedrooms are midsize, cozy, comfortable, and tran-
quil. In the morning you’re served a superior breakfast. The location is only
a short walk up the hill to the heart of New Town. A sister hotel, the
Glenora, offers alternative accommodation on Rosebery Crescent near the
Haymarket railway station.

The Witchery by the Castle
$$$$
Old Town
Part of the famous Edinburgh restaurant (see “Dining out”), the overnight
accommodations in the Witchery offer romantic, sumptuous, and theatri-
cally decorated rooms with Gothic antiques and elaborate tapestries. Most
of the hype about the suites is true: “the perfect lust-den,” “Scotland’s most
romantic hotel,” or “a jewel-box setting.” Cosmopolitan and others have
hailed this place as one of the world’s “most wonderful” places to stay. Each
lavishly decorated suite (named the Library, Vestry, Armoury, and the like)
features splendid furnishings — “fit for a lord and his lady” — and such
extras as books, chocolates, a Bose sound system, and a complimentary
bottle of champagne. Each suite has its own individual character. The latest
is called Sempill, featuring an oak four-poster bed in a red-velvet-lined bed-
room. The buildings near the castle date to the 17th century, filled with
open fires, opulent beds, and luxurious sitting areas. The list of celebrity
guests includes Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones, Simpsons cre-
ator Matt Groening, and Jack Nicholson.

The Bank Hotel

Old Town
This hotel offers better value than many of its competi-
tors in this busy part of the Royal Mile. From the 1920s to the 1990s, it was
a branch of the Bank of Scotland, and the past is still evident in its Greek-
influenced architecture. Inside you’ll discover high ceilings, well-chosen
furnishings, and king-size beds. See map p. 130. 1 S. Bridge St. % 0131-622-6800.

New Town
The buildings that house this inn were first erected in
the 1780s, transformed with alterations of Corinthian and neo-Renaissance
style during the next 150 years or so before becoming the posh George
Hotel in 1950. In the summer of 2006, a whopping £12-million ($22-million)
renovation was completed. A stylish new restaurant and bar, Tempus, is

The Roxburghe provides classy atmosphere reflected in
the elegant drawing room with its ornate ceiling and woodwork, antique fur-
nishings, and tall arched windows. Reopened in 2000 after a multimillion-
dollar redevelopment, the hotel was enlarged into two neighboring
buildings, tripling the original number of guest rooms, which vary in size.

Radisson SAS Hotel
$$$
Old Town
Formerly the “Crowne Plaza,” this baronial-style building
lies midway along the Royal Mile. The hotel is thoroughly modernized and
offers first-class facilities, although it lacks the old-world charm of some of
Edinburgh’s grand dame hotels. Most of the bedrooms are spacious and
well-decorated; bathrooms have heated floors for those chilly Scottish
mornings. Carrubbers restaurant specializes in steak, while the less
formal Itchycoo Bar and Kitchen offers tapas-style eating. See map p. 130.

rooms, while the garden offers an outdoor play area. See map p. 130. 14–15

Dining Out
Food in Scotland is perhaps the most misunderstood aspect of the 
country. Too many people think that cuisine here begins and ends with
haggis, the stuffed sheep’s stomach, but there’s a lot more to the coun-
try’s cuisine. 
Scotland’s reputation for excellent fresh produce is growing. Look out
for the following delights in season: shellfish such as oysters, mussels,
or scallops; locally landed finned fish (such as bream or sea bass); and
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
138

spring lamb or Aberdeen Angus beef. Fresh vegetables include aspara-
gus, peas, and, of course, potatoes — some claim that the spuds grown
in Ayrshire’s sandy soils are unparalleled for their fluffy texture and rich
taste.
The city of Edinburgh boasts many of the best restaurants in Scotland,
indeed a few of the best in the U.K., and the choices the capital has to
offer are more diverse today than ever before. You will find an array of
contemporary Scottish and modern British restaurants as well as French,
fish, and brasserie-style eateries along with cuisines from around the
world, particularly Indian and Thai. Plus, several restaurants exclusively
cater to vegetarians.
The majority of restaurants close in the afternoon, so if you’re looking
for lunch, don’t leave it for too late in the day. The hours I provide in the
listings that follow reflect when food may be ordered, but bars on the
premises may keep longer hours. Many restaurants also close for busi-
ness on either Sunday or Monday — and sometimes both. But during 
the annual Edinburgh Festival from late July to the end of August, many
restaurants also offer extended hours. Given the crowds during this
time, you should always reserve a table in advance.
For more ideas on dining options, buy The List magazine’s annual Eating
& Drinking Guide, a publication that reviews hundreds of restaurants,
bars, and cafes in Edinburgh (and Glasgow).
Scotland is getting better at welcoming families, but it’s still a far cry
from the family-friendliness of, say, Italy or France. That said, give the
local restaurants a try, and resist the temptation to resort to well-known
international chains or fast-food outlets.
Prices
Given the strength of the British currency, prices will seem expensive 
if you convert the cost of meals into dollars. Still, you can find a range 
of choices for most budgets. The prices I list here already include the
17.5 percent VAT, so you won’t see any hidden surprises when the bill
comes. If you’re looking for bargains, inquire about pre-theater special
menus, which can be as much as half the price of the regular dinner
menu. If you have Internet access, log onto www.5pm.co.uk for a list 
of restaurants offering early evening dining discounts.
Lunch and pre-theater menus in Edinburgh often offer the same food as
the full dinner menus but at a much better price. If you’re trying to save
money on your food bills, have a big late lunch or early evening meal.
Tipping
A 10 percent gratuity is standard for service, although you shouldn’t
hesitate to leave nothing if you were badly treated. On the other hand, if
you were truly impressed, consider leaving 15 percent to 20 percent. In a

MODERN SCOTTISH/INTERNATIONAL
Since 1993, this has been one of the most acclaimed and stylish restau-
rants in Edinburgh. Meals are prepared using lots of local and some
organic ingredients, displaying flair but not excessive amounts of fuss or
fancy presentation. Favorites include dishes such as a plate of roasted sea
bass, served with Dauphinois potatoes, baby spinach, charcoal-grilled egg-
plant, and baby fennel. Yum. Or how about seared scallops served with
chiles and garlic on lemon linguini? The desserts are equally superb. The
wine list is excellent but not cheap, with most bottles costing in excess of
£20 ($37). Those on a tighter budget should try the blue bar café in the
same premises (see later).

Old Town
SPANISH
Just off the Royal Mile (near the World’s End Close) with views north to
Calton Hill and the Royal High School, I prefer this casual tapas bar to its

Open for over 30 years, the diner’s burgers are cooked to order with a vari-
ety of toppings (from cheese to garlic butter) and are served with fries,
salad, and a full array of condiments. The only drawback of Bell’s, aside from
its small space, is its limited hours of operation: only open in the evenings,
except on Saturdays when Bell’s is open for both lunch and dinner.

Picnic fare
The Edinburgh weather doesn’t always lend itself to outdoor dining on an expanse of
lawn, but there are certainly days when the sun shines warmly enough to enjoy a
picnic at Princes Street Gardens, the Meadows, Holyrood Park, along the Water of
Leith, or in the Botanic Gardens.
If you’re in the central area of town, the best place to pick up some deli goods is
undoubtedly Valvonna & Crolla, 19 Elm Row (at the top of Leith Walk; % 0131-556-
6066). This Italian shop has an excellent reputation across the U.K. and offers a won-
derful range of cheeses, cured meats, and fresh fruit and vegetables, plus baked goods
from rolls to sourdough loaves, all the condiments you may need, and wine. Another
option in New Town is the food hall at the top of Harvey Nichols department store,
30–34 St. Andrew Sq. (% 0131-524-8388). Freshly prepared salads, lots of dried goods,
and fresh fruit and vegetables are all stocked here.
In Stockbridge, IJ Mellis Cheesemongers, on Bakers Place (% 0131-225-6566), sells
award-winning British and Irish cheeses. The Mellis staff really know their stuff, and
you can find the shop in Old Town on Victoria Street and south of the city center on
Morningside Road as well.
If you’re on the south side of the city near the Meadows, Peckham’s, on Bruntsfield
Place (% 0131-229-7054), is a solid choice for filling a picnic basket. But if you like
Mexican food — Monterrey Jack cheese, real tortillas, and the like — visit Lupe Pintos
in Tollcross, at 24 Leven St. (near the King’s Theatre; % 0131-228-6241). The shop also
stocks some American goods, such as beef jerky, dill pickles, and peanut butter.
Heading toward the Botanic Gardens on the other side of town in Canonmills, at the
roundabout, is a nice Spanish deli called Dionika (% 0131-652-3993). In the port of
Leith, Relish at 6 Commercial St. (% 0131-476-1920) is a modern delicatessen offer-
ing a broad selection from its reasonably small shop.

The menu has dishes that can either serve as starters or a light main meal
and a list of more substantial choices. Solid options include sausages with
mash and onion gravy or goat-cheese tarts with red-onion jam.

The Café Royal has been here for some 140 years, and thankfully, its many
splendorous Victorian touches remain intact. The main menu offers more
than just oysters: Salmon, venison, langoustines, lobster, beef, and rabbit
are often featured menu selections. The restaurant closes after lunch and
reopens for dinner, but the ground-level Circle Bar is open throughout 
the day. The menu there is more limited but also less pricey. A highlight of
this stylish room is the tile pictures of notable inventors. Upstairs, a
second drinking hole, the Bistro Bar, has an ornate ceiling but a less classy
atmosphere.

Unique in Scotland, this restaurant attempts to recreate California cuisine
here on the capital’s less touristy side of town. In truth, they focus on
Pacific Rim–style recipes, which can mean dishes as diverse as curried
gazpacho, ginger and scallion roasted monkfish, or a seven peppered rib-
eye steak. The wine list, however, is devoted to California vintages (plus
two from Oregon) priced only £5 ($9.50) over retail — including Napa
Valley chardonnays and Russian River pinot noirs. The atmosphere is
casual and relaxed, with a West Coast radio station playing in the back-
ground. It’s almost like being in L.A. Closed for lunch Tuesday to Thursday.

Thanks to its restored Victorian-era Royal Bank of Scotland premises on
posh George Street, with Corinthian columns, intricate mosaic tile flooring,
marble-topped bar, potted palms, and towering flower arrangements — all
under an elaborate domed ceiling — it is only honest to say that most
people come here for the look of the Dome Grill Room and Bar. It oozes
class and elegance. Alas, the last time we visited they rather ruined the
ambience with a loud, modern pop/R&B soundtrack that belonged at the All
Bar One branch across the street. The selection of food includes smoked
salmon starters, bowls of mussels, or breast of duck. At the rear of the
building is the garden cafe, which backs onto Rose Street.

THAI
Thistle Street, although little more than a slender lane with narrow side-

rant has quickly developed a reputation for being one of the best in the
city for Thai cuisine. The menu is not typical and has a tendency towards
modern dishes with occasionally prosaic translations, such as “A Pretty
Duck” which is pretty delicious: char-grilled with nuts, mango, and shal-
lots. Some of the main courses incorporate Scottish produce, such as veni-
son, and the seafood options are plentiful.

Seeing as how you’ve come down to the shore, you might as well have
some fish. This place is a favorite for its seafood and view of the harbor at
Leith. Naturally, a nautical theme prevails with fish nets, pictures of the
sea, and various marine memorabilia. The Miller family founded the restau-
rant in the early 1990s, and their chefs offer such enticing dishes as fresh
Loch Fyne oysters, acclaimed as among Britain’s finest, mussels in white

depends on what’s been landed: it might be shark, trout, or turbot. If you
can’t make it to Leith, you can also find a branch of the restaurant in New

MODERN SCOTTISH
No that’s not a misspelling of the name: This restaurant at the top of the
Harvey Nichols boutique department store has excellent views of the Firth
of Forth from the fourth floor of the building. It combines excellent con-
temporary Scottish cooking with those commanding vistas. While you do
feel like you’re dining in a department store annex (despite the slick, min-
imalist décor), the food can be phenomenal, whether a succulent and
robust braised ox tail or a light salad with endive and seasonal truffles.
The produce used by the kitchen is notably fresh. The brasserie menu,
while less extensive than the restaurant’s selections, offers good value
with a fixed-price £14 ($26) lunch and serves an “afternoon menu” between
lunch and dinner. A recently added bar mixes some wonderful cocktails.

and innovative: For example, the menu might include dishes such as a
saddle of Scottish venison with a beet-root fondant or a medley of sea bass
and scallops, served with fennel, olives, and tomato. While the evening a

David Howie Scott opened his first restaurant with modest ambitions (for
example, guests brought their own wine), and then he created a minor
empire in Edinburgh, with a couple branches elsewhere in Scotland as
well. In the capital city, there are four. The one on Victoria Street in Old
Town is probably the most convenient. The minichain’s motto is “fine food
without the faff” — and we might add “sold at reasonable prices,” as well.
Typical dishes include pan-seared supreme of chicken, honey-cured
Scottish salmon, or gnocchi with fresh basil pesto. You can still bring your
own bottle, but the wine list at Howies is as reasonably priced as its menu.

The kebab is usually a late-night meal wolfed down by students standing in
the streets after they have danced their heads off in the club. And while the
late weekend hours of this simple diner means they attract that trade, too,
Kebab Mahal is much more. Drawing a cross-section of the city, whether
dusty construction workers on a break or tweed-clad professors grading
papers, this basic Indian restaurant — where you may have to share your
table with others — has become a landmark. Although the counter is full of
hot food, most of the main courses are prepared separately in a kitchen to
the rear. True to its Islamic owner’s faith, Kebab Mahal doesn’t have a
license to serve alcohol, and doesn’t allow diners to bring their own, either.
It also closes every Friday from 1 to 2 p.m. for prayers.

There has been an extraordinary boom in Thai restaurants in Edinburgh
over the past few years. Just when you think the market is saturated,
another one seems to open. Why? Who knows, although it makes for a

welcomed alternative to the Chinese eateries, with their proclivity to offer
only bland Westernized meals (unless you can speak or read Chinese).
This stylish New Town restaurant is relatively new, offering well-made and
attractively presented curries and other Thai specialties. Everything is
served with the accustomed grace and courtesy that Thai restaurants gen-
erally excel in.

FRENCH
This impressive stone building was constructed in the 17th century as a
warehouse for the barrels and barrels of Bordeaux (claret) and port wine
that came to Scotland from France. And that Auld Alliance carries on with
this restaurant, one of the most romantic in Edinburgh. After a change in
management a few years ago, its reputation has never been higher. The
French-born chef uses Scottish produce in a host of confidently Gallic
dishes. The menu might feature roast stuffed fig with goat’s cheese and
Parma ham, steamed halibut with a classic artichoke Barigoule, or roast
cote de boeuf (for two) with sauce Bearnaise. Wines are specially selected
by Raeburn Fine Wines.

Wannaburger

AMERICAN
Previously called Relish, Wannaburger is a modern diner in the heart of
Old Town serving what it says on the label: burgers. They come with a vari-
ety of toppings, presented on thick sesame seed buns that can make eating
them a challenge. Best of all, the chefs here don’t seem to be afraid to cook
them medium rare on the char-grill (whereas the norm at too many places
is to serve beef burgers well-done). The meat is advertised as 100 percent
Scottish, and there are chicken and veggie options. Decent shakes as well.
Good for a fast meal on the Royal Mile.

fish), contrast with specials such as pan-roasted monkfish with a thyme

ideal for a sumptuous late meal. In addition to the dining room nearest the

Exploring Edinburgh
Edinburgh’s reputation is enormous, and the city essentially lives up to
all the hype. The second most popular destination after London for visi-
tors to Great Britain, the Scottish capital is one of the most picturesque
cities in Europe. Built on a set of hills, it’s unarguably dramatic.
Edinburgh’s Old Town is at the city’s heart, featuring the dramatic
Edinburgh Castle at the top end of the Royal Mile, a street which follows
the spine of a hill down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. For many visi-
tors, this is Edinburgh, with its mews, closes, and alleyways.
But across the valley to the north, a valley now filled by the verdant
Princes Street Gardens, is the city’s New Town, which dates to the
1770s. Here you can find tidy streets and broad avenues, with shops,
squares, and attractions such as the National Portrait Gallery. New
Town reaches out to the villagelike setting of Stockbridge, from which
one can walk along the city’s narrow meandering river, the Water of
Leith, to Dean Village (another district that feels almost rural in nature),
home of the National Gallery of Modern Art and its sister art venue,
the Dean Gallery.
South of Old Town is the sprawling Meadows, with its acres of grass, the
precincts of Edinburgh University, and suburbs such as Marchmont. To
the north are the port of Leith and the Firth of Forth, which empties into
the North Sea.
The only problem with Edinburgh’s many attractions is deciding what
you have time to see. You would need at least a few days to visit every
place listed in this section, so you need to make some decisions depend-
ing on how long you’re planning to be in the city. If you have children in
tow, fewer galleries and more family attractions would probably be best;
if you like art, more museums and fewer wanders may be in store.
Edinburgh’s world famous annual cultural celebration — the Edinburgh
Festival — brings in tourists and lovers of all forms of art from around
the world. But if you prefer a bit more space and smaller crowds, avoid
the month of August in Edinburgh.
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 153

During the Edinburgh Festival, many museums that are normally closed
on Sunday are open, and hours are generally extended. Some museums
that open only in summer are also open on public holidays.
The top attractions
Calton Hill
New Town
Rising some 106m (350 ft.) above sea level, this bluff full of monuments is
partially responsible for Edinburgh’s being called the “Athens of the
North.” People scale the hill not only to see the landmarks up close but
also to enjoy the panoramic views of the Firth of Forth and the city. The
Parthenon-like structure at the summit, the National Monument, was
meant to honor the Scottish soldiers killed during the Napoleonic wars.
However, money for the project ran out in 1829, and the William H.
Playfair–designed structure (once referred to as “Edinburgh Disgrace”)
was never finished. 
The Nelson Monument, containing relics of the hero of Trafalgar, dates
from 1815 and rises more than 30m (100 ft.) above the hill. A time ball at
the top of the monument falls at 1 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and his-
torically, it helped sailors in Leith set their timepieces. The monument is
open from April through September, Monday from 1 to 6 p.m. and Tuesday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; from October through March, it’s
open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission is £3
($5.55).
The old City Observatory along the western summit of Calton Hill was
designed in 1818 by Playfair, whose uncle happened to be the president of
the Astronomical Institute, for which is was built. Nearby, the circular
Dougal Stewart’s Monument of 1831 (by Playfair as well) is not dissimilar
to colonnades of the 1830 Burns Monument designed by Thomas
Hamilton on the southern slopes of Calton Hill. It replicates the Choragic
Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, which was also the inspiration for his
earlier monument to honor the poet in Alloway (see my chapter on
“Ayrshire and Argyll”).
Down the hill towards Princes Street, the Old Calton Burial Grounds offers
a curiosity of special interest to visitors from the United States. The
Emancipation or Lincoln Monument, erected in 1893, was dedicated to
soldiers of Scottish descent who lost their lives in America’s Civil War. It
has a statue of President Abraham Lincoln with a freed slave at his feet.
Some famous Scots are buried in this cemetery, too, with elaborate tombs
honoring their memory (notably the Robert Adam–designed tomb for
philosopher David Hume).
See map p. 156. Walk up Calton Hill from the north end of Princes Street or from Leith
Street. You can also drive up and park. Admission: Free. Open: Year-round dawn to
dusk.

Edinburgh Castle
Old Town
Few places in Scotland can equal the lore associated with Edinburgh
Castle. The very early history is somewhat vague, but in the 11th century,
Malcolm III and his Saxon queen, later venerated as St. Margaret, founded
a castle on this spot. The only fragment left of their original pile — in fact,
the oldest structure in Edinburgh — is St. Margaret’s Chapel. Built in the
Norman style, the oblong structure dates principally from the 12th cen-
tury. After centuries of destruction, demolitions, and upheavals, the build-
ings that stand today are basically those that resulted from the castle’s
role as a military garrison in the past 300 years or so. It still barracks sol-
diers. And much of the displays are devoted to military history, which
might limit the place’s appeal for some. The castle vaults served as 
prisons for foreign soldiers in the 18th century, and these great storerooms
housed hundreds of Napoleonic soldiers in the early 19th century. Some
prisoners made wall carvings still seen today. Among the batteries of arma-
ments that protected the castle is the medieval siege cannon, known as
Mons Meg, which weighs more than 5 tons.
However, it is not all about war and visitors can see where Mary Queen of
Scots gave birth to James VI of Scotland (later James I of England). Scottish
Parliaments used to convene in the Great Hall. Another highlight is the
Scottish Crown Jewels, used at the coronations, along with the scepter and
sword of state of Scotland and the infamous Stone of Scone. Note that last
entry is 45 minutes before closing.

9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.
Gladstone’s Land
Old Town
Now run by the National Trust for Scotland, which rescued the property
from demolition in the 1930s, this 17th-century merchant’s house is deco-
rated in period-style furnishings. It’s not very large, though, and is perhaps
worth a visit if only to get an impression of how confining living conditions
were some 400 years ago, even for the reasonably well-off. Note as well
how small the doorways are — just don’t bump your head. The merchant
Gladstone (then spelled Gledstane) expanded the original 16th-century
structure he purchased in 1617 both upwards and toward the street. In the
front room, added to the second floor, you can see the original facade with
its classical friezes of columns and arches. I particularly admire the sen-
sitively restored timber ceiling, looking suitably weathered and aged, but
with colorful paintings of flowers and fruit.

Museum of Scotland
Old Town
Opened in 1998, this impressive modern sandstone building not far from
the Royal Mile offers exhibits that follow the story of Scotland, including
archaeology, technology, science, the decorative arts, royalty, and geol-
ogy. Hundreds of millions of years of Scottish history are distilled on each
of the museum’s floors. There’s a total of some 12,000 items, ranging from
2.9-billion-year-old rocks found on the island of South Uist to a cute
Hillman Imp, one of the last of 500 automobiles manufactured in Scotland.
One gallery is devoted to Scotland’s centuries as an independent nation
before it merged with England and Wales to form Great Britain in the first
decade of the 18th century. Another gallery, devoted to industry and
empire from 1707 to 1914, includes exhibits on shipbuilding, whisky dis-
tilling, railways, and such textiles as the tartan and paisley. The roof
garden has excellent views, the Tower Restaurant offers superb lunches
(% 0131-225-3003), and adjacent to the Museum of Scotland is the Royal
Museum, with its well-preserved and airy Victorian-era Main Hall and
some 36 more galleries.
See map p. 156. Chambers St. % 0131-247-4422. www.nms.ac.uk.. Bus: 2, 7, 23, 31,

National Gallery of Scotland
New Town
Although the collection held by Scotland may seem small by the standards
of larger countries, it has been chosen with great care and expanded by
bequests, gifts, loans, and purchases. These galleries have only enough
space to display part of the entire body of work. One recent major acqui-
sition was Botticelli’s The Virgin adoring the Sleeping Christ Child. The duke
of Sutherland has lent the museum two Raphaels, Titian’s two Diana can-
vases, and Venus Rising from the Sea. The gallery also has works by El

For fans of Mr. Hyde
Not far from Gladstone’s Land is Brodie’s Close, a stone-floored alley off the
Lawnmarket. It was named after the well-respected cabinet-making father of the 
notorious William Brodie, who was a respectable councilor and deacon of trades by
day — but a notorious thief and ne’er-do-well by night. Brodie’s apparent split per-
sonality (actually he was simply calculating and devious) was likely the inspiration for
Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Brodie was
finally caught and hanged for his crimes in 1788. In a final irony, the mechanism used
in the hangman’s scaffold was perfected by none other than Brodie himself — and he
tried to defy its action by secretly wearing a steel collar under his shirt. It didn’t work.
Across the street from Brodie’s Close is one of the more famous pubs along the Royal
Mile: Deacon Brodie’s Tavern, 435 Lawnmarket (% 0131-225-6531).

Greco and Velázquez and Dutch art by Rembrandt and Van Dyck.
Impressionism and post-Impressionism are represented by Cézanne,
Degas, van Gogh, Monet, Renoir, Gauguin, and Seurat. In the basement
wing (opened in 1978), Scottish art is highlighted. Henry Raeburn is at his
best in the whimsical Rev. Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch,
while the late-19th-century Glasgow School is represented by artists such
as Sir James Guthrie. 
Next door on the Mound is the Royal Scottish Academy (% 0131-624-
6200), connected by the modern designed Weston Link. The RSA was ren-
ovated and now hosts blockbuster exhibitions, such as paintings by Monet
or Titian.
A convenient way to see the Scottish National Galleries is by catching the
courtesy gallery bus that stops at each branch.
See map p. 156. 2 The Mound. % 0131-624-6200. www.nationalgalleries.org.
Bus: 23, 27, 41, 42, 45, or National Galleries shuttle. Admission: free to permanent col-
lections, admission prices vary for special exhibitions. Open: Fri–Wed 10 a.m.–5 p.m.,
Thurs 10 a.m.–7 p.m. Closed Dec 25–26.
The Palace of Holyroodhouse
Old Town
King James IV established this palace at the beginning of the 16th century,
and it lies adjacent to an abbey that King David I had founded in the 1128.
What you see today was mostly built for Charles II in the 1670s. The nave
of the abbey church, now in ruins, still stands, though the north tower is
the earliest bit of the palace that remains intact. This wing was the scene
of Holyroodhouse’s most dramatic incident when Mary Queen of Scots’s
Italian secretary, David Rizzio, was stabbed repeatedly by her jealous hus-
band, Lord Darnley, and his accomplices. A plaque marks the spot where
he died on March 9, 1566. And one of the more curious exhibits is a piece
of needlework done by Mary depicting a cat-and-mouse scene. (Her
cousin, Elizabeth I, is the cat.)
The palace suffered long periods of neglect, but it basked in brief glory
during a ball thrown by Bonnie Prince Charlie in the mid–18th century,
during the peak of his feverish (and doomed) rebellion to restore the
Stuart line to monarchy. And later Holyrood’s fortunes were revived — as
were other royal holdings in Scotland — by Queen Victoria. Today the
royal family stays here whenever they visit Edinburgh. When they’re not
in residence, the palace is open to visitors.
Highlights include the oldest surviving section, King James Tower, where
Mary Queen of Scots lived on the second floor, with Lord Darnley’s rooms
below. Some of the rich tapestries, paneling, massive fireplaces, and
antiques from the 1700s are still in place. The Picture Gallery boasts many
portraits of Scottish monarchs. More recently, the Queen’s Gallery (sep-
arate admission) opened to display works from the royal collection,
whether Mughal art or Dutch paintings.
Behind Holyroodhouse is Holyrood Park, Edinburgh’s largest. With rocky
crags, a loch, sweeping meadows, and the ruins of a chapel, it’s a wee bit
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 159

of the Scottish countryside in the city, and a great place for a picnic. If you
climb up Holyrood Park, you’ll come to 250m-high (823-ft.) Arthur’s Seat,
from which the panorama is breathtaking. The name doesn’t refer to King
Arthur, as many people assume, but perhaps is a reference to Prince Arthur
of Strathclyde or a corruption of Ard Thor, Gaelic for “height of Thor.”

Princes Street Gardens
New Town
A drained loch to the north of Old Town is now filled by the Princes Street
Gardens, the most-used outdoor public space in the city. With Edinburgh
Castle above, this is one of the most picturesque parks in Europe. If you
want a little exercise, climb the 287 steps to the top of the 200-foot Scott
Monument (admission charged) in the East Gardens for a great view of the
castle. Resembling a church spire on a continental European cathedral,
the Gothic-inspired monument is one of Edinburgh’s most recognizable
landmarks. In the center of the tall spire is a large seated statue of Sir
Walter Scott and his dog, Maida, with Scott’s heroes carved as small fig-
ures in the monument.

Royal Botanic Garden
New Town
This is one of the grandest gardens in all of Great Britain, which is certainly
saying something. Sprawling across 28 hectares (70 acres), it dates from
the late 17th century, when it was originally used for medical studies. In
spring, the various rhododendrons, from ground cover to gigantic shrubs,
are almost reason alone to visit, but the planting in various areas assures
year-round interest, whether in the rock garden or along the deep “herba-
ceous” borders elsewhere. When it comes to research, only Kew Gardens
in London does more. The grounds include numerous glass houses, the
Palm House (Britain’s tallest) being foremost among them. Inverleith
House is a venue for art exhibitions and has the Terrace Cafe, too.

Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art
New Town/West End
Scotland’s national collection of 20th-century art occupies a gallery con-
verted from an 1828 school set on 4.8 hectares (12 acres) of grounds, about
a 20-minute walk from the Haymarket railway station. The collection is
international in scope and high quality despite its modest size, with works
ranging from Matisse, Braque, Miró, and Picasso to Balthus, Lichtenstein,
and Hockney. Recently the grounds in front of the museum were dramati-
cally landscaped, with grassy terraces and a pond, into a piece of art itself
called “Landform” by Baltimore-born Charles Jencks. A cafe sells light
refreshments and salads.

Scottish National Portrait Gallery
New Town
Housed in a red-stone Victorian neo-Gothic pile designed by Robert
Rowand Anderson at the east end of Queen Street, the country’s portrait
gallery gives you a chance to see many famous Scots. The portraits by
Rodin, Kokoschka, Ramsay, and Raeburn, among others, include everybody
from Mary Queen of Scots and Flora Macdonald to early golfers, authors,
and enlightenment thinkers. But it’s not all historical characters, as modern
portraits include Sean Connery and Billy Connolly. In addition to paintings,
sculptures, miniatures, and the National Photographic Collection are on
display (although the latter is destined to have a home of its own).

Hume in Nor’ Loch
When the area of Princes Street Gardens was still a bog, the distinguished philosopher
and renowned agnostic David Hume fell in, couldn’t get out, and called for help from
a passing woman. She recognized him, denounced his lack of faith, and refused to
offer her umbrella to pull him out of the mire until he recited the Lord’s Prayer.
Presumably, he obliged.

Parliament finally opened in autumn of 2004. Designed by the late
Barcelona-based architect Enric Miralles, it’s a remarkable bit of modern
design and perhaps worth the expense and delays. The abstract motif
repeated on the facade was apparently inspired by Raeburn’s painting The
Rev. Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch, which hangs in the
National Gallery of Scotland (see listing earlier). Visitors can take a free,
self-guided tour or pay to be led by a guide.

More cool things to see and do
Dean Gallery
New Town/West End
Opening in 1999 across the way from the Scottish Gallery of Modern Art,
the Dean Gallery provides a home for surrealist art and includes a repli-
cation of the studio of Leith-born pop art pioneer Eduardo Paolozzi. He
gave an extensive body of his private collection to the National Galleries
of Scotland, including prints, drawings, plaster maquettes, and molds. The
artist’s mammoth composition of the robotic Vulcan dominates the
entrance hall. Elsewhere works by Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst, and Joan Miró
are displayed, while the Dean also hosts traveling and special exhibitions
of modern art.

Edinburgh Zoo
Corstorphine, west of Murrayfield
Scotland’s largest animal collection is 4.5km (3 miles) west of Edinburgh’s
city center on 32 hectares (80 acres) of hillside parkland offering unrivaled
views from the Pentlands to the Firth of Forth. Run by the Royal Zoological
Society of Scotland, the zoo emphasizes its role in the conservation of
wildlife and contains more than 1,500 animals, including endangered
species: snow leopards, white rhinos, pygmy hippos, and others. The zoo
boasts the largest penguin colony in Europe housed in the world’s largest
penguin enclosure. From April to September, a penguin parade is held daily

The Fruitmarket Gallery
New Town
Near Waverley Station, this is the city’s leading independent, contempo-
rary art gallery, housed in an old covered market dramatically updated
and modernized by architect Richard Murphy in the early 1990s. It hosts
exhibits of internationally renowned modern and conceptual artists,
including Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman, and Yoko Ono — and local
champions, such as Chad McCail and Nathan Coley. The Fruitmarket’s
bookshop and cafe are equally appealing. Across the street is the less inno-
vative but still worthy city-run Edinburgh City Art Centre (2 Market St.;

Georgian House
New Town
Charlotte Square, designed by the great Robert Adam, was the final piece
of the city’s first New Town development. The National Trust for Scotland
has two bits of property here: No. 28 on the south side of the square (its
headquarters with a small gallery) and, on the northern side, this town
house, which has been refurbished and opened to the public. The furni-
ture is mainly Hepplewhite, Chippendale, and Sheraton, all from the 18th
century. A sturdy old four-poster bed with an original 18th-century canopy
occupies a ground-floor bedroom. The nearby dining room has a table set
with fine Wedgwood china as well as the piss pot that was passed around
after the women folk had retired.

Greyfriars Kirk
Old Town
Although the churches of Scotland are not generally on the same scale as
the cathedrals of the Continent, they do have their own slightly austere
allure. Dedicated in 1620, this kirk was the first “reformed” church in
Edinburgh and became the center of a good bit of history. It was built amid
a cemetery that Queen Mary proposed in 1562 because there was no more
burial space at St. Giles Cathedral on the Royal Mile. In 1638, the National
Covenant, favoring Scottish Presbyterianism to the English Episcopacy,
was signed here and an original copy is displayed. Among the many
restorations, one in the 1930s brought in California redwood to create the
current ceiling. The kirkyard’s collection of 17th-century monuments and
gravestones is impressive. The most celebrated grave, however, contains
a 19th-century policeman whose faithful dog, Bobby, reputedly stood

watch for years. The tenacious terrier’s first portrait (painted in 1867)
hangs here while a statue of wee dog — made famous by Hollywood — is
nearby at the top of Candlemaker Row, just outside the pub named in his
honor.

High Kirk of St. Giles
Old Town
A brief walk downhill from Edinburgh Castle, this church — and its steeple
in particular — is one of the most important architectural landmarks along
the Royal Mile. Here is where Scotland’s Martin Luther, John Knox,
preached his sermons on the Reformation. Often called St. Giles Cathedral,
the building combines a dark and brooding stone exterior (the result of a
Victorian-era restoration) with surprisingly graceful buttresses. Only the
tower represents the medieval era of the church. One of its outstanding
features is Thistle Chapel, housing beautiful stalls and notable heraldic
stained-glass windows.

Sun 1–5 p.m.; Oct–Apr Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 1–5 p.m.
John Knox House
Old Town
John Knox is acknowledged as the father of the Presbyterian Church of
Scotland, the Protestant tenets of which he established in 1560. While
some regard him as a prototypical Puritan, he actually proposed progres-
sive changes in the ruling of the church and in education; as well as being
quite renowned for sharp wit and sarcasm. Knox was also a writer/histo-
rian, perhaps best known for the inflammatory treatise, The First Blast of
the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, written in exile and
inspired by his loathing of the reign of three Roman Catholic queens in
Scotland, France, and England. 
Even if you’re not interested in the fire-brand reformer (who probably
never lived here anyway), you may still want to visit this late-15th-century
house. It’s characteristic of the “lands” that used to flank the Royal Mile,
and the house is noteworthy for its painted ceiling as well as its Knox his-
tory. Following three years of renovations, the house reopened in 2006 and
is now integrated into the completely modernized Scottish Storytelling
Centre.

The Meadows
Southside
South of Old Town, this expansive public park separates the city center
from the suburbs and leafy neighborhoods that popped up in the 18th and
19th centuries. The park dates to the 1700s, when a loch on the location
was drained. Tree-lined paths crisscross the soccer, rugby, and cricket
playing fields, but you can find plenty of additional space for having a
picnic or flying a kite. At the far western end of the Meadows is Bruntsfield
Links, a short-hole course which played a role in golf history and can still
be played during the summer.

Museum of Childhood
Old Town
Allegedly the world’s first museum devoted solely to the history of child-
hood, this popular and free museum is just past the intersection of High
and Blackfriars streets. The contents of its four floors range from antique
toys to games to exhibits on health, education, and costumes, plus video
presentations and an activity area. Not surprisingly, this is often the nois-
iest museum in town, although some argue that adults enjoy it more than
kids do.

Our Dynamic Earth
Old Town
Under a futuristic tent-like canopy near the new Scottish Parliament, Our
Dynamic Earth celebrates the evolution and diversity of the planet, with
emphasis on the seismological and biological processes that led from the
Big Bang to the world we know today. The presentation has been called
“physical evolution as interpreted by Disney” — audio and video clips,
buttons you can push to simulate earthquakes, meteor showers, and views
of outer space. There is the slimy green primordial soup where life began
and a series of specialized aquariums, some with replicas of early life
forms, others with actual living sharks, dolphins, and coral. A simulated
tropical rainforest has skies darken at 15-minute intervals, offering tor-
rents of rainfall and creepy-crawlies underfoot. On the premises are a
restaurant, a cafe, a children’s play area, and a gift shop. Last entry is 1
hour and 10 minutes before closing.

Outlook Tower and Camera Obscura
Old Town
The 150-year-old periscopelike lens at the top of the Outlook Tower throws
an image of nearby streets and buildings onto a circular table, which can
be almost magically magnified with just a bit of cardboard. Guides reveal
this trick and help to identify landmarks and discuss highlights of
Edinburgh’s history. In addition, the observation deck offers free tele-
scopes, and there are several exhibits in the “World of Illusions” with an
optical theme that will keep some children occupied. I think it’s disap-
pointing, however, that there is not more to celebrate the man responsible
for the Camera Obscura, Sir Patrick Geddes, a polymath who worked tire-
lessly to improve the fortunes of the Old Town in the 19th and 20th cen-
turies and kept it from being torn down. The last camera presentation
begins one hour before closing.

The Real Mary King’s Close
Old Town
Beneath the municipal City Hall on the Royal Mile lies a warren of hidden
streets where people lived and worked for centuries. When the Royal
Exchange (now the City Chambers) was constructed in 1753, the top floors
of the existing buildings were torn down and the lower sections were left
standing to be used as the foundations. This left a number of dark, myste-
rious passages largely intact. These underground “closes,” originally very
narrow walkways with houses on either side, date back centuries. In 2003,
groups led by guides dressed up as characters from the past began to visit
these dwellings for the first time in perhaps 250 years. During the tours,
visitors return to the turbulent and plague-ridden days of the 17th century.
Dim lighting and an audio track are intended to add to the experience.

Royal Yacht Britannia
Leith
The royal yacht Britannia launched on April 16, 1953, and traveled more
than one million miles before it was decommissioned in December 1997.
Several cities competed to permanently harbor the ship as a tourist attrac-
tion. The port of Leith won, and today the ship is moored next to the Ocean
Terminal shopping mall some 3km (2 miles) from Edinburgh’s center. Once
you’re aboard, a 90-minute audio tour will guide you about the vessel. You
can see where Prince Charles and Princess Diana strolled the deck on their
honeymoon; visit the drawing room and the Royal apartments; and explore

The Writers’ Museum
Old Town
This remnant of a 17th-century house contains a trove of portraits, relics,
and manuscripts relating to Scotland’s greatest men of letters: Robert
Burns (1759–96), Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832), and Robert Louis Stevenson
(1850–94). The Writers’ Museum is often a surprisingly uncrowded space.
The basement is perhaps best, with a good deal of items from the life of
Stevenson (including his fishing rod and riding boots), as well as a gallery
of black-and-white photographs taken when he lived in the South Pacific.
The main floor is devoted to Scott with his dining room table from 39
Castle St., his pipe, chess set, and original manuscripts. Another set of
rooms gives details of Burns’s life (note his page-one death notice in a copy
of London’s Herald, dated 27 July, 1796) along with his writing desk, rare
manuscripts, portraits, and other items. The premises, Lady Stair’s House,
with its narrow passages and low clearances were originally built in 1622
for Edinburgh merchant Sir William Gray.

Guided tours
For an entertaining, one-hour overview and introduction to the principal
attractions of Edinburgh, consider the Edinburgh Bus Tours that leave
every 20 minutes or so from Waverley Bridge from April to late October.
You can see most of the major sights along the Royal Mile, the
Grassmarket, Princes Street, George Street, and more from the double-
decker open-top motor coaches. Three tours — Edinburgh Tour (green
buses), City Sightseeing (red buses), and Mac Tours (vintage buses) —
all cover roughly the same ground in Old Town and New Town. The
Majestic Tour buses, however, make short work of the city center as
they go down to Leith as well. Tickets are valid for 24 hours, and you can
hop on and hop off the bus at designated stops as you choose. The first
tour is at 9:30 a.m., and the last is usually around 5:40 p.m. (slightly later
from July through Sept). For more information on Edinburgh Bus Tours
call % 0131-220-0770 (www.edinburghtour.com). Tickets are £9 ($17)
adults, £8 ($15) seniors and students, £3 ($5.55) children ages 5 to 15
(younger than 5 ride free), and £20 ($37) for a family of two adults and
up to three children.
The Literary Pub Tour traces the footsteps of such literary greats as
Robert Burns, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Sir Walter Scott, going into

the city’s taverns and highlighting the tales of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or
the erotic love poetry of Burns. They leave nightly at 7:30 p.m. from the
Beehive Inn, a popular pub on the Grassmarket, from June to September;
Thursday to Sunday in April, May, and October; and just on Friday from
November to March. For more information, call % 0131-226-6665 (www.

Edinburgh’s history is filled with tales of ghosts, gore, and witchcraft,

The father of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–1894) was a restless character. Raised in Edinburgh, he
found the place unsuitable for his frail constitution. This, combined with his wander-
lust, meant that he spent much of his life traveling and living outside his native
Scotland. The author has been alternately hailed as Scotland’s greatest writer and
dismissed as nothing more than the creator of tall tales for children, though surely the
former is more accurate.
He was the son of Margaret and Thomas Stevenson, born into a family famed for its
Scottish civil engineering projects, especially lighthouses. RLS was a sickly child and,
as a young adult, something of disappointment to his father. After he allowed his son
to bow out of engineering and the lucrative family business, Thomas made Robert
attend law school, vowing that “the devious and barren paths of literature” were not
suitable. RLS, undaunted, became a writer and a bit of rogue. One of his favorite bars
still stands today: Rutherford’s on Drummond Street near South Bridge Street. 
Determined to roam (“I shall be a nomad”) and write, he went to France where he met
and later married an American, Fanny Osborne, with whom he traveled to California.
Following the success of The Sea-Cook (1881), which became the ever-popular
Treasure Island, Stevenson produced The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, an
instant bestseller and his most famous work — thanks in no small part to later
Hollywood adaptations. That was quickly followed by the classic Kidnapped (1886),
his most evocative book. It reflects the troubled political times in Scotland after the
failed 1745 rebellion of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the book takes its 16-year-old hero
on an adventure across the Western Highlands. 
Eventually RLS and Fanny settled in Samoa, hoping to find a climate that would suit
his scarred lungs. While here, Stevenson worked on the unfinished classic, Weir of
Hermiston (published posthumously in 1896). On December 3, 1894, only 43 years old,
he collapsed and died.

Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
You may just want to wander around Edinburgh, which is easy enough —
it’s a small place and many of the tourist attractions are within the cen-
tral part of the city. However, if your time in the capital is limited to a few
days, here are some suggested itineraries that highlight some of the very
best things to do and see.
If you have one day
If you’re unfortunate enough to only have one day in Edinburgh, I sug-
gest that you stick to the city’s famous Royal Mile and Old Town. It is
every bit a day’s worth of activity, with plenty of history and attractions
from Edinburgh Castle to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, shops, restau-
rants, and pubs. Wander down some of the alleys off the Royal Mile, too.
If you have two days
Follow my one-day itinerary for your first day, and on your second day,
take the hop-on, hop-off bus tour that emphasizes the New Town. Your
ticket is good for 24 hours (although the buses stop running in the late
afternoon/early evening). Get off on Calton Hill for the views, which
Robert Louis Stevenson said were the best in the city. Amble down
Princes Street for a bit of shopping and afterwards take a break in
Princes Street Gardens. Admire some of art at one of the branches of 
the National Gallery.
If you have three days
Days 1 and 2 should be filled with the activities I suggest in the previous
two sections. On Day 3, take in Leith, Edinburgh’s once rough-and-tumble
port. A seaside village that is now part of Edinburgh, Leith has a rich his-
tory of its own. Today it also offers some good restaurants and lively
pubs. On your way back into the city center, also worth a visit, is the
Botanic Gardens. It’s one of the best in Britain — and that’s saying a lot. 
If you have any time to spare, visit Stockbridge or the Meadows, which
have an off-the-main-tourist-tracks feel to them.
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 169

If you (are lucky and) have four days or more
Start with my recommendations from the previous sections and then 
on Day 4 climb Arthur’s Seat for views of the city and the sea, or if you
have children, take the family to the Edinburgh Zoo. Explore the regions
around the city, heading east to the coast near North Berwick or west to
nearby historic Linlithgow.
Taking a walking tour
Given that Edinburgh is a relatively compact city, walking is one of the
best ways to see it. This fact is especially true in the Old Town, where
passages and alleys — or “closes” (pronounced cloz-es) and “vennels,”
as the locals prefer — run off both sides of the main street like ribs from
a spine. You really owe it to yourself to wander down a few of them to
appreciate the medieval core of the Scottish capital. 
If you want to leave the tourist trail, however, I have devised the follow-
ing walk south of the Royal Mile, which will give you a notion of what
“real” Edinburgh is like — as well as takes you past some historical and

Edinburgh’s big summer events
The cultural highlight of Edinburgh’s year comes every August during the Edinburgh
International Festival and Festival Fringe. Since 1947, the International Festival has
attracted artists and companies of the highest standards, whether in classical music,
opera, ballet, or theater. Running almost simultaneously is the Fringe, an opportunity
for anybody — professionals or nonprofessionals, individuals, groups of friends, or a
whole company — to put on a show wherever they can find an empty stage or street
corner. For many people today, the Fringe is the festival thanks to its late-night revues,
contemporary drama, university theater presentations, and even full-length opera.
Over the years, the Fringe has become increasingly established (and sponsored)
though hardly less experimental and unexpected.
As if the International Festival and the Fringe weren’t enough, Edinburgh also hosts,
at about the same time, a variety of other festivals. In Charlotte Square, the Book
Festival has become a huge annual event, drawing authors such as J.K. Rowling and
Toni Morrison. You may also stumble upon the international Film Festival, a Jazz
Festival, and a Television Festival. One of the season’s more popular spectacles is
the Military Tattoo on the floodlit esplanade of Edinburgh Castle. The show features
precision marching of not only Scottish regiments but also soldiers and performers
(including bands, drill teams, and gymnasts) from dozens of countries.
Ticket prices for festivals, the Fringe, and other shows or events vary from £1 ($1.85)
to £50 ($93). The headquarters for the International Festival is The Hub, Castle Hill 
(%0131-473-2000). The Fringe is based at 180 High St. (%0131-226-0000). General infor-
mation on festivals and most events can be found on the Web at www.edinburgh
festivals.co.uk.

architectural highlights. The route’s only about 1.2km (2 miles) long and
shouldn’t take you more than an hour or so to complete (if you don’t go
into buildings or get distracted, that is).
Start the walk at:
1. West Bow
Initially this street zigzagged right up the steep slope from the
Grassmarket to Castlehill. With the 19th-century addition of
Victoria Street, however, West Bow links more easily with the Royal
Mile via George IV Bridge. The combination of Victoria Street and
West Bow create a charming and winding road of unpretentious
shops, bars, and restaurants. At the base of the street is the West
Bow Well, which was built in 1674. To the west is the Grassmarket.
Go southeast from Cowgate. Head up Candlemaker Row to:
2. Greyfriars Kirk
This isn’t the church you see while ascending Candlemaker Row, but
instead lies to the right at the top. Greyfriars Kirk was completed in
1620 (for some history, flip back to the church’s listing in the section
“More cool things to see and do,” earlier in this chapter).
Cross George IV Bridge to Chambers Street and the:
3. Museum of Scotland
Directly in front of you as you leave Greyfriars is the impressive
and modern Museum of Scotland. It was designed by architects
Benson and Forsyth and constructed mostly with sandstone from
the northeast of Scotland. (Next door on Chambers Street is the
Royal Museum, a bonus if you have free time.) Chambers Street is
named after a 19th-century lord provost (the equivalent of a
mayor) whose statue stands in front of the museum’s Victorian
Great Hall. Further down off Chambers Street on what is today
Guthrie Street, you can find Sir Walter Scott’s birthplace.
Continue east on Chambers Street to South Bridge, turning right
(south). At this corner is the:
4. Old College
The 1781 exteriors of the University of Edinburgh Old College 
have been called the greatest public work of Robert Adam. The uni-
versity was first established in 1583 by James VI (and later James I of
England), and this “Old College” actually replaced an earlier campus.
In the southwest corner is the entrance to the Talbot Rice gallery
(www.trg.ed.ac.uk), which displays contemporary art. One of
Robert Louis Stevenson’s favorite saloons — the Rutherford Bar — is
on nearby Drummond Street and a plaque commemorating his admi-
ration for it is posted. The neighborhood also offers more recent lit-
erary history. A cafe here is reputedly where J.K. Rowling began
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 171

writing the Harry Potter series. More recently, the establishment
became a Chinese restaurant.
At Drummond Street, South Bridge becomes Nicolson Street.
Continue south on it to:
5. Nicolson Square
The impressive building you passed on the left (across from the
modern Festival Theatre) before arriving at this square was the
Surgeons’ Hall, designed by William Playfair in the 1830s. Nicolson
Square dates to 1756, and the buildings along its north fringe appar-
ently were the first to be built here. In the square’s park you can
see the Brassfounders’ Column created by James Gowans in 1886.
Leave the square at the west on Marshall Street, turn left (south)
onto Potterrow, and turn right (west) at the parking lot entrance
and Crichton Street to:
6. George Square
Almost entirely redeveloped by the University of Edinburgh in the
20th century, George Square originally had uniform if less than star-
tling mid–18th century town houses. The square predates the city’s
New Town developments, and some of the early buildings are still
standing on the western side of the square. The park provides a
quiet daytime retreat. Sir Walter Scott played in this park as a child.
(A little trivia: The square was named after the brother of the
designer James Brown and not a king.)
Exit the square at the southwest corner, turning right (west) into:
7. The Meadows
This sweeping park separates central Edinburgh from the southern
suburbs, such as Marchmont, which were largely developed in the
19th century. At the Western end is Bruntsfield Links, which some
speculate entertained golfers in the 17th century and still has a
short course with many holes available for play today.
Turn right a short distance later (at the black cycle network marker)
and follow the bike/pedestrian path, Meadow Walk, north to:
8. Teviot Place
The triangle of land formed by Teviot Place, Forrest Road, and
Bristo Place is a hotbed of university life today, with its cafes and
bars. To the right (east) is the Medical School. To the left (west) 
on Lauriston Place is the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. George
Watson’s Hospital on the grounds dates to the 1740s, but Scots
baronial (a type of architecture) buildings superseded it in the 19th
century, adopting the open-plan dictates of Florence Nightingale.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
172

Walk west on Lauriston Place to:
9. George Heriot’s School
Heriot was nicknamed “the Jinglin’ Geordie,” and as jeweler to
James VI, he exemplified the courtiers and royal hangers-on who
left Scotland and made their fortunes in London after the unifica-
tion of the crowns at the beginning of the 17th century. Heriot, at
least, decided to pay Edinburgh back by leaving more than £20,000
($37,000) to build a facility for disadvantaged boys. Of the 200-odd
windows in the Renaissance pile, only two are exactly alike. Today,
the building is a private school for both boys and girls.
Continue on Lauriston Place to the edge of the campus and turn
right on Heriot Place. Continue down the step and a path called the
Vennel to the:
10. Grassmarket
Located just at the top of the steep steps of the Vennel is another
piece of the Flodden Wall, the southwest bastion, indicating how
the Grassmarket was enclosed in the city by the 16th century. Now
home to loads of bars and restaurants, the Grassmarket — in the
shadow of the castle — hosted a weekly market for more than 400
years. Until the 1780s, the Grassmarket also was the site of public
gallows and a place where zealous Protestants — known as the
Covenators — were hung, as was Maggie Dickson, who, according
to legend, came back to life. She at least has a pub named after her
today. At the nearby White Hart Inn, both Burns and Wordsworth
are said to have lodged.
Shopping in Edinburgh
Edinburgh may lack all of the shopping options available in Glasgow, but 
it has a combination of newfangled boutiques, souvenir shops, and tradi-
tional department stores, such as the classic John Lewis. With the addition
a few years ago of the fashionista’s favorite, Harvey Nichols, Edinburgh is
certainly challenging the more style-conscious city to the west. 
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 173
Hogmanay
Hogmanay is what the Scots call New Year’s Eve, and Edinburgh now hosts one of the
biggest New Year’s Eve parties on the planet. In Scotland, the festivities traditionally
don’t really even begin until the clock strikes midnight and then they continue until
daybreak or later. In 1993, the Edinburgh City Council began a three-day Hogmanay
festival featuring rock bands, street theater, and a lively procession. By 1997, the event
had become so big that participation is now reserved for ticket holders. For informa-
tion, visit www.edinburghshogmanay.org.

Goods are not inexpensive, however. Many items carry the same numeri-
cal price in pounds as they would in American dollars. So, a pair of
hiking shoes that cost $100 in New York might well be priced £100 ($185)
in Edinburgh, making them nearly 100 percent more expensive.
Best shopping areas
New Town’s Princes Street is a primary shopping artery in the Scottish
capital; it’s home to leading department stores including the homegrown
Jenners and the British staple Marks & Spencer. But for the posher
shops, such as Cruise or Laura Ashley, George Street tops the lot. In
between is Rose Street, a narrow pedestrian lane that’s best known for
its pubs but is actually full of more shops.
For tourists on the hunt for more traditional souvenirs, the Royal Mile in
Old Town presents the Mother Lode, whether it’s tartan or trinkets you
seek. For small boutiques, try William Street in the West End.
Shopping hours in Edinburgh are generally only from 9 or 10 a.m. to 
6 p.m., Monday through Wednesday and on Friday and Saturday.
Thursday is the so-called late shopping day, with many shops opening at
9 or 10 a.m. and remaining open to 7 or 8 p.m. Shops open Sundays from
11 a.m. or noon and close at around 5 p.m., although smaller operations
may remain closed on Sunday.
Shopping complexes
In addition to the primary shopping districts in New Town and Old
Town, a few shopping malls with a concentration of shops are scattered
around. The newest is in Leith: Ocean Terminal (% 0131-555-8888;
www.oceanterminal.com). Debenhams, French Connection, Gap, and
other stores have set out their stalls in this retail cathedral, which gets a
lot of footfall from tourists because the royal yacht Britannia is moored
here as well.
Above Waverley train station and beneath the city’s main tourist infor-
mation center, Princes Mall (% 0131-557-3759; www.princesmall-
edinburgh.co.uk) appears to have something for everyone — except 
a leading department store. About 80 shops sell fashions, accessories,
gifts, books, jewelry, and beauty products, and a food court offers the
typical fast-food outlets.
St James Centre (% 0131-557-0050; www.stjamesshopping.com) is
slightly more upscale than Princes Mall. At the top of Leith Walk near
Calton Hill, this shopping center is anchored by John Lewis’s depart-
ment store, giving the place a nice touch of respectability.
What to look for and where to find it
If your shopping intentions are less of the browsing variety, here are
some of Edinburgh’s specialized shopping options.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
174

Books
 Blackwell’s is the new name for the once venerable James Thin
bookstore, Edinburgh’s most respected seller. Despite the new cor-
porate owners, the shop has at least maintained a knowledgeable
staff and a wide-ranging stock of fiction and nonfiction. 53 S. Bridge
St. (% 0131-622-8222; www.blackwells.co.uk).
 McNaughtan’s Bookshop is one of the city’s best antiquarian and
secondhand book purveyors. Consider it a must-stop for book
lovers. 3a–4a Haddington Place at the top of Leith Walk near
Gayfield Sq. (% 0131-556-5897; www.mcnaughtansbookshop.com).
 Waterstone’s is a giant Barnes and Noble–like operation with plenty
of stock and a lot of soft seats. It’s the most prominent book retailer
in the city center and has a good Scottish section on the ground
floor. Other branches in New Town are at the western end of Princes
Street and on George Street. 128 Princes St. (% 0131-226-2666).
Clothing/Fashion
 Arkangel is in the city’s affluent West End, which offers a host of
boutique shops. This one specializes in women’s designers and
sells brands that no other store in Scotland does. U.K. designer
duds sold here include Clara Collins and Ginka. 4 William St., West
End (% 0131-226-4466).
 Corniche is one of the more sophisticated boutiques in Edinburgh;
if it’s the latest in Scottish fashion, expect to find it here. Offerings
have included “Anglomania kilts” created by that controversial lady
of clothing design, Vivienne Westwood, as well as fashions by
Gautier, Katherine Hamnett, and Yamamoto. 2 Jeffrey St., near the
Royal Mile (% 0131-556-3707).
 Cruise is commonly associated with Glasgow, but this home-grown
fashion outlet began in Edinburgh’s Old Town — not generally con-
sidered fertile ground for the avant-garde. You can still find a shop
off the Royal Mile, but this New Town outlet is the focus for cou-
ture. 94 George St. (% 0131-226-3524).
 Walker Slater is a handsome shop full of well-made and contempo-
rary (if understated) men’s clothes, which are usually made of
cotton and dyed in rich, earthy hues. It also carries Mackintosh
overcoats and accessories for the smart gentleman about town. 
20 Victoria St. (% 0131-220-2636).
Crafts and jewelry
 Alistir Wood Tait is a jewelry store with a reputation for Scottish
gems and precious metals such as agates, Scottish gold, garnets, and
sapphires. Ask to see the artful depictions of Luckenbooths — two
entwined hearts capped by a royal crest, usually fashioned as pen-
dants. 116A Rose St. (% 0131-225-4105; www.alistirtaitgem.
co.uk).
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 175

 Hamilton & Inches has sold gold and silver jewelry, porcelain and
silver, and gift items including quaichs since 1866. Folkloric quaichs
(drinking vessels now mostly used to give as gifts) originated in the
West Highlands as whisky measures crafted from wood or horn.
They were later gentrified into something resembling silver chafing
dishes, each with a pair of lugs (ears) fashioned into Celtic or this-
tle patterns. 87 George St. (% 0131-225-4898; www.hamiltonand
inches.com).
 Ness Clothing is filled with whimsical accessories scoured from
around the country — from the Orkney Islands to the Borders.
Ness offers hand-loomed cardigans and tasteful scarves, amid
much more. 336 Lawnmarket. (% 0131-225-8155).
Department stores
 Harvey Nichols opened in 2002 with much celebration but was a
tad slow to catch on. Perhaps traditional shoppers were not quite
prepared for floors of expensive labels and designers such as
Jimmy Choo or Alexander McQueen. But they’re learning. 30–34 
St. Andrew Sq. (% 0131-524-8388; www.harveynichols.com).
 Jenners opened in 1838, and the shop’s neo-Gothic facade is
almost as much an Edinburgh landmark as the Scott Monument 
just across Princes Street. Although controversially sold in 2005 
to House of Fraser, the store’s array of local and international mer-
chandise hasn’t changed much. It also has a food hall with a wide
array of gift-oriented Scottish products, including heather honey,
Dundee marmalade, and a vast selection of shortbreads. 48 Princes
St. (% 0870-607-2841).
 John Lewis is the largest department store in Scotland, and this
branch is many people’s first choice when it comes to shopping for
clothes, appliances, furniture, toys, and more. St James Centre near
Picardy Place at the top of Leith Walk (% 0131-556-9121).
Edibles
See the sidebar “Picnic fare” earlier in this chapter for select food mar-
kets with Scottish specialties.
Gifts
 Geraldine’s of Edinburgh is also known as the “Doll Hospital.”
Each of the heirloom-quality dolls here requires days of labor to
create and has a hand-painted porcelain head and sometimes an
elaborate coiffure. Also available are fully jointed, all-mohair teddy
bears. 133–135 Cannongate (% 0131-556-4295).
 Tartan Gift Shops has a chart indicating the place of origin (in
Scotland) of family names, accompanied by a bewildering array of
hunt and dress tartans for men and women, all sold by the yard.
The shop also carries a line of lambswool and cashmere sweaters.
54 High St. (% 0131-558-3187).
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
176

Hats, knits, and woolens
 Bill Baber is a workshop/store that turns out artfully modernized
adaptations of traditional Scottish patterns for both men and
women. Expect to find traditional knits spiced up with strands of
Caribbean-inspired turquoise or aqua or rugged-looking blazers or
sweaters suitable for treks or bike rides through the moors. 66
Grassmarket (% 0131-225-3249; www.billbaber.com).
 Edinburgh Woollen Mill Shop is one of several in the capital and of
about 280 outlet shops throughout the United Kingdom that sell
practical Scottish woolens, knitwear, skirts, gifts, and travel rugs.
Note: Whatever the name of the shop, most of the merchandise 
is made in England. 139 Princes St. (% 0131-226-3840; www.ewm.
co.uk).
 Fabhatrix has hundreds of handmade felt hats and caps, many
practical as well as attractive and some downright frivolous but
extremely fun. Remember: Keep your head warm and your whole
body stays warm. 13 Cowgatehead, near Grassmarket (% 0131-
225-9222).
 Ragamuffin sells what’s termed “wearable art,” created by some 150
designers from all over the U.K. The apparel here is one-of-a-kind
unique. Well, not exactly — Ragamuffin also has a shop way up north
on the Isle of Skye. 276 Canongate, Royal Mile (% 0131-557-6007;
www.ragamuffinonline.co.uk).
Music
 Avalanche usually has a bunch of harmless goth kids hanging out
in front of it. You can find this branch of the excellent CD shop
where the steep steps of the Fleshmarket Close meet Cockburn
Street. It’s best for new releases of indie bands. Another Avalanche
shop is on West Nicolson Street. 60 Cockburn St., near the Royal
Mile (% 0131-225-3939).
 Fopp offers books and rock, pop, jazz, and dance CDs. Fopp’s Rose
Street branch even has a bar selling beer, so you can swill while
you sample at a listening station. Another branch is located on
Cockburn Street. 7–15 Rose St. (% 0131-220-0310).
 Virgin Megastore is where you find one of the biggest selections of
records, CDs, videos, and tapes in Scotland. The shop has tradi-
tional and Scottish music as well as the mainstream offerings. 125
Princes St. (% 0131-220-2230).
Tartans and kilts
 Anta sells some of the most stylish tartans. Woolen blankets with
hand-purled fringe are woven here on old-style looms. Crocket’s
Land, 91–93 West Bow (% 0131-225-4616).
 Geoffrey (Tailor) Kiltmakers has a list of customers that includes
Sean Connery, Charlton Heston, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, members of
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 177

Scotland’s rugby teams, and Mel Gibson. It stocks 200 of Scotland’s
best-known tartan patterns and is revolutionizing the kilt by estab-
lishing a subsidiary called 21st Century Kilts, which makes them 
in fabrics ranging from denim to leather. 57–59 High St. (% 0131-
557-0256).
 Hector Russell, a well-known kiltmakers shop on the Royal Mile,
creates bespoke — that’s made-to-order — clothes made from tar-
tans. Another branch is located on Princes Street. 137–141 High St.
(% 0131-558-1254).
 James Pringle Weavers produces a large variety of wool items,
including cashmere sweaters, tartan and tweed ties, travel rugs,
tweed hats, and tam o’ shanters. In addition, it boasts a clan ances-
try center with a database containing more than 50,000 family
names. 70–74 Bangor Rd., Leith (% 0131-553-5161).
Whisky
 Royal Mile Whiskies stock some 1,000 different whiskies from
Scotland and other nations. Prices range from around £20 ($37) to
£900 ($1,665). Staff know their stuff, so tell them what you prefer
(for example, smoky, peaty, sweet, and so on) and they’ll find a
bottle to please you. 379 High St. (% 0131-622-6255). 
Living It Up After Dark
Every summer, Edinburgh becomes the cultural capital of Europe and
the envy of every other tourist board in the U.K. when it hosts the
International Festival, Festival Fringe, Book Festival, Film Festival, and
Jazz Festival. All totaled, these festivals bring in thousands of visitors 
to see hundreds of world-class acts — whether in drama, dance, music,
comedy, or more. In August, the Scottish capital becomes a proverbial
“city that never sleeps.”
Although the yearly festivals (www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk) are no
doubt the peak of Edinburgh’s social calendar, the city offers a pretty
good selection of entertainment choices throughout the year. Visitors
can busy themselves with the cinema, clubs, theater, opera, ballet, and
other diversions such as a night at the pub.
For a complete rundown of what’s happening in Edinburgh, pick up a
copy of The List, a biweekly magazine available at all major newsstands
and bookshops. It previews, reviews, and gives the full details of arts
events here — and in Glasgow.
The performing arts
The West End is the cradle of theater and music, home to the legendary
and innovative Traverse Theatre as well as the Royal Lyceum Theatre
and the classic Usher Hall for concerts.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
178

 Edinburgh Festival Theatre reopened in 1994 after serious renova-
tions in time for the Edinburgh Festival (hence the name). Located
on the south side of the city about a ten-minute walk from the Royal
Mile and right near the University of Edinburgh’s Old Campus, the
1,900-seat theater hosts the national opera and ballet, touring com-
panies, and orchestras. Tickets are £5–£45 ($9.25–$83). 13–29
Nicolson St. (% 0131-529-6000 box office; 0131-662-1112 administra-
tion; www.eft.co.uk; Bus: 5, 7, 8, or 29).
 Edinburgh Playhouse is best known for hosting popular plays or
musicals and other mainstream acts when they come to town,
whether it’s Miss Saigon or Lord of the Dance. Formerly a cinema, the
playhouse is the largest theater in Great Britain, with more than 3,000
seats. Tickets are £8–£35 ($15–$65). 18–22 Greenside Place (% 0131-
524-3333; www.edinburgh-playhouse.co.uk; Bus: 5 or 22).
 Kings Theatre is a 1,300-seat late Victorian era venue with a dome
ceiling and rather Glasgow-style stained glass doors and red-stone
frontage. Located on the edge of Tollcross southwest of the castle, it
offers a wide repertoire, especially traveling West End productions,
productions of the Scottish National Theatre, other classical enter-
tainment, ballet, and opera. During December and January, it’s the
premier theater for popular pantomime productions in Edinburgh.
Tickets range from £5–£20 ($9.25–$37). 2 Leven St. (% 0131-529-
6000; www.eft.co.uk; Bus: 11, 15, or 17).
 Royal Lyceum Theatre (built in 1883) has a most enviable reputation
with presentations that range from the most famous works of
Shakespeare to new Scottish playwrights. It’s home to the leading
theater production company in the city, often hiring the best
Scottish actors such as Brian Cox, Billy (Lord of the Rings) Boyd, and
Siobhan Redmond — when they’re not preoccupied with Hollywood,
that is. Grindlay Street (% 0131-248-4848 box office; 0131-238-4800
general inquiries; www.lyceum.org; Bus: 1, 10, 15, or 34).
 Traverse Theatre is just around the corner from the Royal Lyceum
and is something of a local legend. Beginning in the 1960s as an
experimental theater company that doubled as a bohemian social
club, it still produces the height of contemporary drama in Scotland.
This custom-made subterranean complex actually contains two the-
aters, seating 100 and 250, respectively, on the benches. Upstairs, the
Traverse Bar is where you find the hippest dramatists, actors, and
their courtiers. Tickets are £4–£14 ($7.40–$26). 10 Cambridge St. 
(% 0131-228-1404; www.traverse.co.uk; Bus: 11 or 15).
 Usher Hall is unbeatable when it comes to concerts. Built thanks to
the bequest of distiller Andrew Usher in the 1890s, this beaux-arts
building is Edinburgh’s equivalent of Carnegie Hall. During the
International Festival, it hosts such ensembles as the Cleveland or
London Philharmonic orchestras. But Usher Hall isn’t only a venue
for classical music: Top touring jazz, world music, and pop acts
play here throughout the year. Lothian Road (% 0131-228-1155;
www.usherhall.co.uk; Bus: 1, 10, 15, or 34).
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 179

Comedy
Given the importance of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where the
vaunted Perrier Award for comedy can launch a career, the stand-up
comedian is . . . err, taken very seriously in the Scottish capital.
 Jongleurs Comedy Club is a corporate-owned entity from down
south with more than a dozen venues across the U.K. Jongleurs
came to Scotland a few years back, dragging along its own cadre 
of house funnymen (and funnywomen) as well as some touring
comedians from overseas. Tickets are £4–£15 ($7.40–$28). Omni
Centre, Greenside Place (% 0870-787-0707; www.jongleurs.com;
Bus: 7 or 22).
 The Stand, just down the hill from St. Andrew Square, is the pre-
mier local comedy venue. Big acts are reserved for weekend nights,
while local talent tries their jokes and tales during the week. On
Sundays, no admission is charged for brunch performances.
Tickets range from £1–£8 ($1.85–$15). 5 York Place (% 0131-
558-7272; www.thestand.co.uk; Bus: 8 or 17).
Dance clubs
Clubbing isn’t quite as popular now as it was in the 1980s and 1990s, but
it probably still draws more people than the folk, jazz, and classical
music scenes combined. In this section, I’ve listed just a sampling of the
clubs in Edinburgh.
 Bongo Club offers a varied music policy throughout the week —
funk, dub, and experimental. This venue has more reasonably
priced drinks than many others. The cover charge can be up to £8
($15). The club’s open daily from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. Moray House, 
37 Holyrood Rd. (% 0131-558-7604; www.outoftheblue.org; 
Bus: 35).
 The Honeycomb goes for techno and electro, drum and bass, 
funk, and house. This is a stylish club off the Cowgate that also
books some of the big-name DJs in the U.K., such as crossover
celebrity Goldie. The cover may be up to £15 ($28). 15–17 Niddry
St. (% 0131-530-5540; Bus: 35). 
 Po Na Na is a branch of a successful chain of clubs in Britain. The
theme is a Moroccan Casbah with décor to match thanks to wall
mosaics, brass lanterns, and artifacts shipped in from Marrakech.
The dance mix varies from hip hop and funk to disco and sounds of
the ’80s. The cover can be up to £5 ($9.25). Po Na Na’s open daily
until 3 a.m. 43B Frederick St. (% 0131-226-2224; www.ponana.
co.uk; Bus: 80).
Folk music
Although touring folk acts — performers such as American Gillian Welsh
are pretty huge in Scotland — get booked into the larger music halls, the
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
180

day-to-day folk scene in Edinburgh takes place in unassuming public
houses.
 The Royal Oak is where Old Town meets the Southside, just a few
minutes’ walk from the Royal Mile off South Bridge. The pub is the
home of live Scottish folk music. On Sundays from 8:30 p.m. on, var-
ious guests play at the “Wee Folk Club.” Tickets are £3 ($5.55). The
Royal Oak is open daily until 2 a.m. 1 Infirmary St. (% 0131-557-
2967; Bus: 3, 5, 8, or 29).
 Sandy Bell’s offers live folk or traditional music virtually every
night from about 9 p.m. and all day Saturday and Sunday. This small
pub near the Museum of Scotland is a landmark for Scottish and
Gaelic culture. Sandy Bell’s is open Monday through Saturday from
11:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. and Sunday from 12:30 to 11 p.m. 25 Forrest Rd.
(% 0131-225-2751; Bus: 2 or 42).
Rock, pop, and jazz
Although it’s not listed here, the very big acts — whether Bob Dylan,
REM, or the Rolling Stones, for example — are likely to play outdoors 
at the national rugby facility, Murrayfield Stadium.
 Corn Exchange is a bit of a haul out of the city center. But this
venue was meant to compete with the likes of Glasgow’s infamous
Barrowland ballroom, where touring groups absolutely love to
appear. The comparison isn’t really fair, but the Corn Exchange
isn’t a bad medium-to-small size hall (capacity 3,000) to see rock
acts. 11 New Market Rd. (% 0131-477-3500; www.ece.uk.com;
Bus: 4 or 28).
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 181
Late-night eats
Okay, its Friday or Saturday night. You’ve been out to a play, the pub, or a dance club
and now you’re utterly starving. But it’s sometime between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. (you’re
not exactly sure because your watch seems to be keeping Australian time at the
moment). Food will help you get back on track. If you’re in the West End, Lothian Road
is your best bet. Try Lazio, 95 Lothian Rd. (% 0131-229-7788), for a bit of pizza or pasta.
It’s open until midnight during the week and until 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights
(technically, that’s Saturday and Sunday mornings). In Old Town, another Italian eatery
caters to night owls: Gordon’s Trattoria on the High Street (% 0131-225-7992) is open
until 3 a.m. on the weekends (until midnight Sun–Thurs). For something a bit more
modern and trendy, Favorit is a NYC-style diner on Teviot Place (% 0131-220-6880)
that stays open until 3 a.m. daily.

 The Liquid Room has space for less than 1,000 people. This is
Edinburgh’s best venue for catching the sweat off the brows of
groups. Mostly booked by local bands, such as Mull Historical
Society, and visiting indie acts such as the Datsuns; it’s also a busy
dance club when not hosting such groups. 9c Victoria St. (% 0131-
225-2564; www.liquidroom.com; Bus: 35).
Bars and pubs
The most active areas for pubs and clubs are the Cowgate and
Grassmarket in the Old Town and Broughton Street in New Town,
although the university precincts on the Southside are lively, as are the
pubs near The Shore in the Port of Leith. Unless otherwise noted, the
bars and pubs listed below are generally open Sunday through Thursday
from 11 a.m. or noon until 11 p.m. or midnight, often closing at 1 a.m. or
2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights.
 The Abbotsford’s bartenders have been pouring pints since around
1900. (Not the same bartenders, mind you.) The gaslight era is still
alive here thanks to the preservation of the dark paneling and
ornate plaster ceiling. The ales on tap change about once a week,
and you can find a good selection of single malt whiskies, too.
Platters of food are dispensed from the bar Monday through
Saturday from noon to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 10 p.m. 3 Rose St. 
(% 0131-225-5276; Bus: 3, 28, or 45).
 Black Bo’s is a stone’s throw from the Royal Mile. Many visitors
may find its dark walls and mix-and-match furniture downright
plain, but I think it has a rather unforced hipness. And due to its
proximity to the hostels of Blackfriars Street, Black Bo’s often hosts
chatty groups of young foreigners enjoying a pint or two. DJs play
from Wednesday to Saturday; downstairs is a pool room with a juke
box. The bar doesn’t serve food, but its mostly vegetarian restau-
rant next door does. 57 Blackfriars St. (% 0131-557-6136; Bus: 35).
 Bow Bar, located just below Edinburgh Castle, is a classic Edinburgh
pub that appears little changed by time or tampered with by foolish
trends. Surprise: It’s only a few more than a dozen years old. Never
mind that, though. The pub looks the part of a classic and features
some eight cask-conditioned ales, which change regularly. The
Scottish brewed options may include the dark and smooth Lia Fail
(Gaelic for “Stone of Destiny,” the rock on which Scottish kings were
enthroned) from the Perthshire-based Inveralmond Brewery. No food
served. 80 West Bow (% 0131-226-7667; Bus: 2 or 35).
 Café Royal Circle Bar is a well-preserved Victorian-era pub.
Spacious booths combined with plenty of room around the island
bar create a comfortable and stylish place to drink. Above-average
food from the same kitchen as the neighboring oyster bar/restaurant
is served daily. 17 W. Register St. (% 0131-556-1884; Bus: 8 or 13).

Chapter 11: Edinburgh 183
American Express
The office is at 69 George St., at Frederick
Street (% 0131-718-2501; Bus: 13, 19, or 41).
It’s open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. On
Wednesdays, the hours are 9:30 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m. and on Saturdays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Opal Lounge, in New Town, is an excellent example of the so-called
modern style bar. After opening in 2001, it became the haunt of
Prince William when the handsome heir to the British throne
attended St. Andrew’s University. Opal Lounge draws a predomi-
nantly young, well-dressed, and affluent crowd, combining a long list
of cocktails with a cavernous underground space. Drinks are served
daily from noon to 3 a.m.; food of an Asian-fusion nature is served
daily from noon to 10 p.m. 51a George St. (% 0131-226-2275; Bus:
24, 29, or 42).
 The Outhouse is one of the more contemporary outfits on or near
busy Broughton Street. The bar was renovated in 2003 with rich
brown hues. During good weather spells, a beer garden out back
offers an excellent open-air retreat and some outdoor heaters help
take the chill off the night. 14 Broughton St. Ln. (% 0131-557-6688;
Bus: 8 or 17).
 The Shore, down in Leith, fits seamlessly into the seaside port ambi-
ence without resorting to a lot of the usual decorations of cork and
netting. The place is small, but on nice days they put a few seats out
front to soak in the afternoon sun. On three nights of the week, you
can find live folk and jazz music. Food is served from noon to 2:30
p.m. and 6:30 to 10 p.m. 3–4 The Shore (% 0131-553-5080; Bus: 16 
or 36).
Going to the cinema
 The Filmhouse, the capital’s most important cinema, is the focus 
of the Edinburgh Film Festival — one of the oldest annual film 
festivals in the world. The movies shown here are foreign and art
house, classic and experimental, documentary and shorts. Plus, the
Filmhouse hosts discussions and lectures with directors during the
Festival and at other points throughout the year. The cafe/bar does
drinks, serves light meals, and remains open late. Consider this a
must-stop for any visiting film buffs. Tickets range from £1.20–£5.50
($2.20–$10). 88 Lothian Rd. (% 0131-228-2688; www.filmhouse
cinema.com; Bus: 10, 22, or 30).
 Vue Edinburgh is a big glass-fronted multiplex below Calton Hill at
the roundabout near the top of Leith Walk. It offers first-run, big
commercial releases. Tickets are £3.30–£5.60 ($6.10–$10). Omni
Centre, Greenside Place (% 0871-224-0240; www.myvue.com; Bus: 
7 or 22).

Currency Exchange
Many banks in the Old and New Towns
exchange currency. Post offices run
bureaux de change as does the Edinburgh
Information Office (% 0131-473-3800).
Major hotels also exchange currency but
charge a premium for the service. ATM
machines in the city center are linked to
major banking systems such as Cirrus and
Plus, so you’ll almost definitely be able to
draw money directly from your bank
account at home.
Dentists
If you have a dental emergency, go to the
Edinburgh Dental Institute, 39 Lauriston
Place (% 0131-536-4900; Bus: 35), open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Alternatively, call the National Health
Service Helpline (% 0800-224-488).
Doctors
You can seek help from the Edinburgh Royal

easyeverything.com; Bus: 42), is open
daily from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. It has 448
terminals. You can get online here for as
little as 50p (95¢), although some shops
require £1 coins.
Laundry/Dry Cleaning
For your dry-cleaning needs, the most 
central service is probably at Johnson’s
Cleaners, 23 Frederick St. (% 0131-225-
8095; Bus: 13, 19, or 42), which is open
Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m. and Saturday from 8:30 a.m. 
to 4 p.m.
Luggage Storage/Lockers
Given the tenor of the times, left luggage
can prove problematic if an alert is in place.
Generally speaking, you can store luggage
in lockers at Waverley Station or with your
hotel.
Newspapers
Published since 1817, the Scotsman is a
quality daily newspaper with a national and
international perspective, while its sister
publication, the Evening News, concen-
trates more on local affairs. For compre-
hensive arts and entertainment listings and
reviews of local shows, buy The List maga-
zine, which is published every other
Thursday and weekly during the Festival.
Metro, a free daily (Mon–Fri) available on
buses and in train stations, also gives list-
ings of daily events.

Pharmacies
There are no 24-hour drugstores (called
chemists) in Edinburgh. The one with proba-
bly the longest hours is the branch of Boots
at 48 Shandwick Place, west of Princes
Street (% 0131-225-6757; Bus: 12 or 25). It’s
open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 
8 p.m., Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and
Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Post Office
The Edinburgh Branch Post Office, St.
James Centre, is open Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. For gen-
eral postal information and customer serv-
ice, call % 0845-722-3344.
Restrooms
These are found at rail stations, terminals,
restaurants, hotels, pubs, and department
stores. A system of public toilets, often
marked WC, is in place at strategic corners
and squares throughout the city. They’re
safe and clean but likely to be closed late in
the evening.
Safety
Edinburgh is generally one of Europe’s
safest capitals. But that doesn’t mean
crimes, especially muggings, don’t occur at
all. They do, largely because of Edinburgh’s
problems with drug abuse.

G
lasgow is only about 74km (46 miles) west of Scotland’s capital,
Edinburgh, but there’s a noticeable contrast between the two
cities. Glasgow (pronounced glaaz-go by natives) doesn’t offer the fairy-
tale setting of the Scottish capital, but compensates with a lively culture,
big-city feel, and gregarious locals.
Glasgow’s origins are actually quite ancient, making Edinburgh seem
comparatively young. Archeologists have uncovered evidence of Roman
settlements in the city. In the 6th century, St. Kentigern (or St. Mungo) is
believed to have begun a monastery at the site of Glasgow Cathedral,
on a hillside along a burn (creek) that feeds into the River Clyde. The
site’s a logical one for settlement because it allows convenient access to
ford the mighty River Clyde before it widens on its way to the sea some
32km (20 miles) away to the west.
However, aside from the Cathedral itself, practically none of this
medieval ecclesiastical center (which included a university) remains,
and much of Glasgow’s historical records (kept at the Cathedral) were
lost during the Protestant Reformation. The city, however, once less key
than others in the west of Scotland, became the country’s economic
powerhouse in the 18th century. Glasgow quickly grew into the coun-
try’s largest city (it is the fourth most populous in the entire U.K.). The
boom began in earnest with the tobacco trade to the New World, in
which Glasgow outpaced rivals such as London and Bristol largely due
to faster sailing times to the New World.
The city then became famous worldwide for shipbuilding with docks that
produced the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and other fabled ocean liners.
It was, for a while, the Second City of the Empire. But post-industrial
decline gave Glasgow a poor reputation as a city of slums, particularly in
contrast to the enduring charms of Edinburgh. Internationally, the city

may even now struggle to convince those who may have seen Glasgow in
the 1970s that it’s a safe, vibrant, and cosmopolitan city today.
In the 1980s, Glasgow reversed its fortune by becoming Scotland’s con-
temporary cultural capital, drawing talent from across the U.K., whether
in visual art or rock ’n’ roll. Decades of grime were sandblasted away
from its monumental Victorian buildings and visitors began to recognize
that the city had one of Europe’s best municipally-owned collections of
art in the Burrell Collection and recently renovated Kelvingrove Art
Gallery. In 1990, the city was deemed the European Capital of Culture (a
prestigious honor awarded by the European Council of Ministers), thus
certifying the changes that occurred. 
Glasgow’s not a city without flaws, however. Serious pockets of poverty
remain in its peripheral housing projects (called estates or schemes). A
major motorway cuts a scar through the center of town, and although
the splendor of what critics hailed as “the greatest surviving example 
of a Victorian city” is evident, Glasgow still prefers to knock buildings
down and erect new structures.
Glasgow is a good gateway for exploring Burns Country in Ayrshire to
the southwest. From the city, you can also tour Loch Lomond and see
some of the Highlands, and you’re less than an hour away from Stirling
and the Trossach mountains. Also on Glasgow’s doorstep is the scenic
estuary of the Firth of Clyde, with islands only a short ferry ride away.
For details on those regions within striking distance from Glasgow,
please see the chapters in Part IV, “the Major Regions.”
Getting to Glasgow
Most flights into Glasgow Airport from North America connect via
London, but some airlines offer direct service from the U.S. and Canada.
If you’re traveling up from London, you can easily take the train to
Glasgow’s Central Station or fly to Glasgow Airport. If you’re coming
from elsewhere in Scotland, highway, train, and bus routes service the
city in all directions. The city’s central bus station is a couple of blocks
from George Square, in the heart of the town, and the two main train sta-
tions are both within walking distance, too. Figuring out the best way to
come into Glasgow is easy — it all depends on the time you have and the
flexibility you desire.
By air
Glasgow International Airport (% 0870-040-0008 or 0141-887-1111) is
located at Abbotsinch, near Paisley, only about 16km (10 miles) west of
the city via M8. Monday through Friday, British Airways runs an almost
hourly shuttle service between London’s Heathrow Airport and Glasgow.
The first flight departs London at 7:15 a.m. and the last flight leaves at
9:15 p.m.; service is reduced on weekends, depending on volume. For
Chapter 12: Glasgow 187

flight schedules and fares, call British Airways in London at % 0870-
551-1155 or log onto www.ba.com, which offers a slight discount on
ticket prices. 
The schedule of direct flights from North America to Glasgow is subject
to change. In recent years, American Airlines (% 800-433-7300 or 0845-
778-9789; www.aa.com) has offered a daily nonstop flight to Glasgow
from Chicago between mid-May and October, but announced in 2006 that
it might terminate the route. Continental has offered similar direct serv-
ice out of Newark International, while US Airways has operated flights
between Glasgow and Philadelphia.
BMI (formerly British Midland; % 0870-607-0555; www.flybmi.com)
offers internal U.K. flights and flights to European hubs. Aer Lingus
(% 800-223-6537 or % 0845-084-4444 at Dublin Airport; www.aer
lingus.ie) flies daily from Dublin to Glasgow.
South of Glasgow is Prestwick International Airport (% 0871-223-
0700), which is favored by some of the low-budget airlines, such as
RyanAir. Prestwick’s on the railway line to Ayr, about a 45-minute ride
from Glasgow’s Central Station. Remember, as well, that Edinburgh
International Airport is less than 74km (46 miles) away.
Orienting yourself
Glasgow airport is fairly small and therefore presents scant opportuni-
ties for getting lost. Immigration control and customs agents are vigilant,
but the scene is quite a bit more relaxed than at giant air terminals such
as London’s Heathrow. Usually there is just one line (called a queue) for
visitors from outside the European Union. Arrivals with E.U. passports
can generally breeze right through.
Getting into town from the airport
Regular Glasgow CityLink bus service runs between the airport and the
city center, terminating at the Buchanan Street Bus Station. The ride
takes only about 20 minutes (though it can be much longer during rush
hour) and costs £5 ($9.25) for a round-trip ticket. A taxi to the city
center costs about £17 ($31).
By train
Trains from London arrive in Glasgow at Central Station in the heart of
the city (call National Rail Enquiries; % 08457-48-49-50 for rail and fare
info). The trains that directly link London and Glasgow (via Preston and
Carlisle) on the so-called West Coast Main Line don’t have the same 
reputation for timeliness and efficiency as those going to Edinburgh.
However, the semi-privatized company responsible for railway mainte-
nance, Network Rail, is spending literally billions to upgrade the line and
create a faster service.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
188

But work has been slow, and while it’s ongoing, travel is subject to
delays. The trains (operated by Virgin; % 08457-222-333; www.virgin.
com/trains) on the West Coast Main Line depart from London’s Euston
Station every hour or so and the trip to Glasgow generally takes 51⁄2 hours
these days. If you plan a trip on the West Coast Main Line, however, call
and find out if any major “track works” are scheduled during your jour-
ney. If so, you can expect delays and the possibility of riding on a bus for
a portion of the trip. Virgin prices, similar to all the U.K.’s train-operating
companies, are diverse and complicated. In general, you might get a one-
way ticket for as little as £35 ($65) although the standard advance pur-
chased ticket is more likely to be between £90–£100 ($167–$185).
You may prefer trains run by operators GNER (www.gner.co.uk) from
London’s Kings Cross station up the East Coast Main Line via Newcastle,
Edinburgh, and across (via Motherwell) to Glasgow. The trip takes about
the same amount of time as one on the West Coast Main Line. Glasgow’s
Central Station is also the terminus for trains from the southwest of
Scotland and a hub for numerous trains to city suburbs in most direc-
tions. A ten-minute walk away (or via shuttle bus 398) is Queen Street
Station. From here, a shuttle service to and from Edinburgh runs every
15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes in the evenings until
about 11:30 p.m. The round-trip fare during off-peak times (travel from
9:15 a.m.–4:30 p.m. and after 6:30 p.m.) is £8.80 ($16), and the trip takes
just under an hour.
Trains to the north (Stirling, Aberdeen, and such Highland destinations
as Oban, Inverness, and Fort William) as well as to Glasgow’s suburbs
also run frequently through Queen Street Station. By the way, Glasgow
has the biggest commuter rail network in Britain after London.
By bus
The journey from London to Glasgow by bus can take at least 8 hours.
National Express (% 0870-580-8080; www.nationalexpress.com) runs
buses daily (typically at 9 a.m., noon, and 10:30 p.m. for direct service)
from London’s Victoria Coach Station to Glasgow’s Buchanan Street Bus
Station (% 0870-608-2608), about 2 blocks north of the Queen Street
Station on North Hanover Street. The round-trip fare is £37 ($68),
although it’s cheaper if you book more than seven days in advance.
Scottish CityLink (% 0870-550-5050; www.citylink.co.uk) also has
frequent bus service to and from Edinburgh, with a one-way ticket cost-
ing £3 to £5 ($5.55–$9.25).
By car
Glasgow is 74km (46 miles) west of Edinburgh, 356km (221 miles) north
of Manchester, and some 625km (388 miles) north of London. From
England and the south, you reach Glasgow by the M1 or M5 to the M6 in
the Midlands, which becomes the M74 at Carlisle. The M74 runs north to
the southeastern conurbation of greater Glasgow, where drivers can link
Chapter 12: Glasgow 189

with the M8, which runs right through the city’s center before heading
west. The M8 also links Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Other routes into the city are the M8 from Edinburgh, the M77 from Ayr,
and A8 from the west. A82 comes in from the northwest (the Western
Highlands) on the north bank of the Clyde, and A80 also goes into the
city. (This route is the southwestern section of M80 and M9 from Stirling.)
Orienting Yourself in Glasgow
The monumental heart of Glasgow lies north of the River Clyde. The
area is divided between the larger and mostly Victorian Commercial
Centre and the more compact district now designated the Merchant
City (in honor of the tobacco and cotton “lords” who lived and ran busi-
nesses there from the 1700s). Glasgow is a vibrant modern city with art
galleries, theaters, multiplex cinemas, music halls — not to mention hun-
dreds of bars and restaurants. The Merchant City roughly is to Glasgow
as SoHo is to Manhattan: full of warehouses converted to condos, stylish
bars, and trendy restaurants. The City Centre offers loads of shopping
opportunities on the pedestrian stretches of Argyle, Buchanan, and
Sauchiehall streets. If the river creates a southern boundary for “down-
town” Glasgow, then the M8 motorway creates both its western and
northern limits. The eastern boundary is set by the High Street, which
while now on the fringes of the city center was historically the core of
Glasgow.
Virtually all evidence of Glasgow’s medieval existence was demolished
by the well-meaning, if history-destroying, urban renewal schemes of
late Georgian and Victorian Glasgow. Practically nothing remains to give
any idea of how the city looked before the 18th-century boom, which 
is a particular shame because, by some accounts, it was once one of
Europe’s most attractive medieval burghs. Still standing on the hill at 
the top of the High Street, however, is Glasgow Cathedral, an excellent
example of pre-Reformation Gothic architecture that dates to the early
13th century. Across the square is Provand’s Lordship, the city’s oldest
surviving house, built in the 1470s. Down the High Street you find the
Tolbooth Steeple (circa 1626) at Glasgow Cross, and nearer the River
Clyde is Glasgow Green, one of Britain’s first large-scale public parks.
Glasgow reputedly has more green spaces per resident than any other
European city.
The city’s salubrious and leafy West End, home to the University of
Glasgow, is just a short journey from the city center, on the other side of
the M8. The terraces of Woodlands Hill, rising to Park Circus, afford excel-
lent views. Across Kelvingrove Park is a red sandstone palace, the city’s
Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum (refurbished and re-opened to
mass popular appeal in 2006). Nearby, the tower of Glasgow University
dominates Gilmorehill. Byres Road, the social and entertainment destina-
tion in the West End, is a street full of restaurants, cafes, bars, and shops.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
190

The city’s Southside sprawls from the River Clyde and is largely residen-
tial. A little more than 5km (3 miles) southwest of Glasgow’s center in
wooded Pollok Country Park is the vaunted Burrell Collection. This
museum of antiquity and art has become one of the city’s top tourist
attractions. The commercial heart of the Southside is Shawlands, which
offers an increasing number of good restaurants, and nearby Queens
Park is a hilly classic of Victorian planning.
Glasgow’s East End is only slowly redeveloping after its industrial heyday
when tons and tons of steel were manufactured. It’s the least affluent dis-
trict in Glasgow and, according to surveys, is one of the poorest and least
healthy areas in all of Europe. But statistics don’t tell the entire story.
Visitors to the East End’s Gallowgate on the weekend should see the 
flea market stalls of the Barras. And East End neighborhoods such as
Dennistoun are gradually drawing young, creative types who can no
longer afford apartments in the West End or the Southside — a renais-
sance is simmering.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Glasgow is composed of a variety of neighborhoods and districts, from
the compact urban area of the Merchant City to the inner-suburban and
University of Glasgow–dominated area called Hillhead.
City Centre
Cathedral (Townhead)
St. Mungo apparently arrived here in A.D. 543 and built his little church in
what’s now the northeastern part of the city’s center. Glasgow Cathedral
(aka St. Kentigern’s or St. Mungo’s) was at one time surrounded by a vari-
ety of buildings: prebendal manses and the long-destroyed Bishops Castle,
which stood between the cathedral’s west facade and the Provand’s
Lordship, which still exists in largely its original form. East of the
Cathedral is one of Britain’s largest Victorian cemeteries, Glasgow’s
Central Necropolis.
Merchant City
The city’s first New Town development lies southeast of the city’s
modern core. The so-called Merchant City extends from Trongate and
Argyle Street in the south to George Street in the north. Because the
medieval closes off the High Street were regarded as festering sores, the
affluent moved to newly developed areas to the west. Now, Merchant
City is one of few inner-city areas of Glasgow in which people reside.
Gallowgate
One of the streets that prosperous city businessmen once strolled, the
Gallowgate is today the beginning of the city’s East End. The Saracen’s
Head Inn stood here and took in such distinguished guests as Dr. Samuel
Johnson and James Boswell in 1774 after the duo’s famous tour of the
Chapter 12: Glasgow 191

Hebrides. Today, the Gallowgate is best known for the Barras market and
Barrowland, a one-time ballroom that’s now a popular live-music venue.
Saltmarket
The first settlements in Glasgow were on the hill by the Cathedral, but
existing almost as early were dwellings in this area at the opposite end
of the High Street, along the banks of the Clyde. The Saltmarket served
as the trading post where the river could be forded. The street named
the Bridgegate (pronounced brig-it) leads to the first crossing erected
over the Clyde. Today Victoria Bridge crosses the river at the same spot.
Constructed in the 1850s, it is the oldest bridge in Glasgow.
Commercial Centre
The biggest of the central districts of Glasgow, the city’s Commercial
Centre includes areas of 19th-century development, such as Blythswood
and Charing Cross (although the latter was severed from the city by the
M8 freeway). This area offers Victorian architecture at its finest. Luckily,
even though the city had a mind to tear it all to the ground in the middle
to late 1960s, city leaders realized that it had something of real interna-
tional interest and preserved the area instead.
Broomielaw
It has been said that “the Clyde made Glasgow.” From docks here in
Broomielaw, Glasgow imported tobacco, cotton, and rum and shipped
its manufactured goods around the world. After becoming a rather lost
and neglected part of the city, Broomielaw today is targeted for renewal,
with luxury flats planned along the riverbank.
Garnethill
Up the steep slopes north of Sauchiehall Street, this neighborhood is best
known for the Charles Rennie Mackintosh–designed Glasgow School of
Art. Developed in the late 1800s, Garnethill offers good views of the city
and is also home to the first proper synagogue built in Scotland.
West End
Woodlands
Centering on Park Circus at the crown of Woodlands Hill, this neighbor-
hood is the first one just west of the M8 freeway. It is a mix of residential
tenements and retail stretches, particularly on Woodland and Great
Western roads. South to the river lies the district of Finnieston, and its
most visible landmark is the old shipbuilding crane that stands like
some giant dinosaur. Along the Clyde is the Scottish Exhibition Centre.
West of Woodlands is Kelvingrove, with its Art Gallery, Museum, and
impressive park.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
192

Hillhead
With the Gilmorehill campus of the University of Glasgow, Hillhead is
rather dominated by academia. Its main boulevard is Byres Road, which
is the High Street of the West End. In addition to the university, two
other major institutions reside in Hillhead: BBC Scotland on Queen
Margaret Drive and NHS Western Infirmary next to the University.
Partick
The railway station at Partick is one of the few in the city to translate the
stop’s name into Gaelic: Partaig. Indeed, the neighborhood has a bit of
Highland pride, although there’s no particular evidence that Highland
people have settled here in great masses. Partick is one of the less pre-
tentious districts of the central West End. To the north are leafy and
affluent Hyndland and Dowanhill.
Southside
Gorbals
If one area seems to represent the slums of early 20th-century Glasgow,
it is this one. This neighborhood, just across the Clyde from the city’s
center, developed a rather notorious reputation for mean streets and
unsanitary tenements. As such, the city demolished Gorbals in the early
1960s and erected sets of modern high apartment towers, which in turn
developed a reputation for unsavory and unpleasant conditions. I per-
sonally wish that some of the old Gorbals still stood. Today, the towers
are coming down and the New Gorbals has been developed on a more
human scale, although the fabric of the place still seems torn and frayed.
One good thing is that it’s home to the Citizens’ Theatre, one of the most
innovative and democratic in the U.K.
Govan
Govan was settled as early as the 10th century, making it another eccle-
siastical focal point along with the medieval cathedral north of the river.
Until 1912, it was an independent burgh and was one of the key ship-
building districts on the south banks of the Clyde. One of the first major
shipyards in the neighborhood, Mackie & Thomson, opened in 1840. But
with the demise of shipbuilding, the fortunes of Govan fell, too. Today,
the Science Centre and other developments in the area (such as a
planned new Transport Museum) are hoped to revive Govan’s fortunes.
Pollokshaws
Along with Pollokshields and Crosshill, these neighborhoods form the
heart of the city’s more modern Southside suburbs. Pollok Park and the
Burrell Collection are the key tourist attractions. Queens Park is perhaps
better and more verdant than Kelvingrove Park, even if it lacks the mon-
uments and statues of its West End counterpart.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 193

Finding information after you arrive
The Greater Glasgow and Clyde Valley Tourist Board, 11 George Sq.
(% 0141-204-4400; Underground: Buchanan St.), is possibly the coun-
try’s most helpful office. In addition to piles of brochures, you can find a
small bookshop, bureau de change, and a hotel reservation service that
charges a booking fee of £3 ($5.55) for local accommodations. During
peak season, the office is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to
7 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Hours are more limited during
winter months. 
Information about travel can be a bit more frustrating. Start with
Traveline (% 0870-608-26078), which offers timetable information and
advice on routes, but can’t quote ticket prices. It will give out the tele-
phone numbers of privatized bus companies or rail operators, and you
will then have to call them for information on ticket prices.
Getting Around Glasgow
One of the best ways to explore Glasgow is on foot, but then I like walk-
ing. The center of town is laid out on a grid, which makes map reading
relatively easy. However, some of the city’s significant attractions, such
as the Burrell Collection, are in surrounding districts and to visit those
you’ll need to rely on public transportation or a car.
By subway
The underground, affectionately called the “Clockwork Orange” (due to
the vivid hues of the trains, which travel in a virtual circle), offers a 15-
stop system linking the City Centre, West End, and a bit of the Southside.
Generally, the wait for trains is no more than five to eight minutes, but
trains run at longer intervals on Sunday and at night. The one-way fare is
£1 ($1.85), or you can buy a 20-trip ticket for £15 ($28). The underground
runs Monday through Saturday from 6:30 a.m. to about 11:30 p.m. and
Sunday from 11 a.m. to about 6 p.m.
The Transcentre (local ticket sales only) at St. Enoch subway station, 
2 blocks from the Central Station, is generally open Monday through
Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., but it closes early on Wednesday.
On Sunday, the hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Glasgow and the surrounding region have the largest train network in
Great Britain after London, and these suburban trains are useful for visi-
tors. Like the subway, the system is operated by Strathclyde Passenger
Transport (SPT), and service runs to both Central and Queen Street sta-
tions. During the day, trains run as frequently as every ten minutes or so
to destinations in the West End and on the Southside. Service is less fre-
quent after the evening rush hour and terminates around midnight. The
trains aren’t cheap by European standards: A typical round-trip (return)
fare is £2 to £3 ($3.70–$5.55).

Chapter 12: Glasgow 195

For families on an excursion, the Daytripper ticket is an excellent value.
For £15 ($28), two adults and up to four children (5–15 years old) can
travel anywhere in the system (including broad swaths of Ayrshire) by
suburban train, the underground, most buses, and even a few ferries.
For one adult and two children the fare is £8.50 ($16).
For information on SPT tickets only, call % 0141-332-6811 Monday
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., or log on to www.spt.co.uk.
By bus
Glasgow has an extensive (though somewhat confusing) bus service run
primarily by the privately owned First Group company. Routes tend to
run between east and west or north and south points, with almost all
buses coming through the center of Glasgow. Service should be frequent
during the day, although irritatingly buses seem to arrive at the same
time. After 11 p.m. service is curtailed on most routes, but some (for
example the 9, 12, 40, and 62) run all night (at least on weekends).
Typically, one-way (single) fares cost no more than £1.15 ($2.15).
For about £2.50 ($4.65), you can ask First Group bus drivers for an all-day
ticket, good for buses all day long (after 9:30 a.m.) with a few restrictions.
You might see blue double-deckers called the Magic Bus. They are
cheaper, but, annoyingly, tickets are not transferable between the private
bus operators. A weeklong ticket costs £12 ($22). The city bus station is
the Buchanan Street Bus Station. The Traveline number (% 0870-608-
2608) gives timetable information (but not fares). You can also log on to
www.firstgroup.com for more detailed information about bus service
within Glasgow.
By taxi
Metered taxis are the same excellent ones as found in Edinburgh or
London — the so-called Fast Black, which you can hail or pick up at 
taxi ranks in the central city. Alternatively, you can call TOA Taxis at 
% 0141-429-7070. No matter the company, fares are displayed on a
meter next to the driver. When a taxi is available on the street, a sign on
the roof is lit. Most taxi trips within the city cost £5 to £15 ($9.25–$28). 
A surcharge is imposed for late-night/early morning runs. Private Hire
cars run by various companies are also available, but they can’t be
hailed. Call % 0141-774-3000.
By car
You’re better off using public transportation (especially at rush hour)
than driving, but Glasgow goes a long way toward accommodating car
use by offering several multistory parking lots. Metered parking is avail-
able but expensive, and you need plenty of coins to feed the meter,
which issues a ticket that you must then affix to your windshield. Some
zones in residential areas are marked PERMIT HOLDERS ONLY — your vehicle
may be towed if you lack a permit. A double yellow line along the curb
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
196

indicates no parking at any time. A single yellow line along the curb indi-
cates restrictions, too, so be sure to read the signs on what the limita-
tions are for a particular area before choosing a spot.
If you want to rent a car, it’s best to arrange the rental in advance. But if
you want to rent a car locally, most companies will accept your foreign
driver’s license. All the major rental agencies are represented at the 
airport. In addition, in the city try Avis Rent-a-Car at 70 Lancefield St.
(% 0870-608-6339), Budget Rent-a-Car at 101 Waterloo St. (% 0800-
212-636), or Arnold Clark at multiple locations (% 0845-607-4500).
By bicycle
Although bikes aren’t as widely used in Glasgow as in Edinburgh, most
parts of the city are tolerable for biking. For what the Scots call “cycle
hire,” go to a well-recommended shop about a kilometer (a half mile)
west of the town center, just off Byres Road: West End Cycles, 16–18
Chancellor St. (% 0141-357-1344; Underground: Hillhead or Kelvinhall
or Bus: 9 or 18). The shop is close to the National Cycle Trail that leads
to Loch Lomond, and it rents bikes well suited to the hilly terrain of
Glasgow and surrounding areas. Bikes cost about £15 ($28) per day and
a cash deposit or the imprint of a valid credit card will be necessary as
security. Closer to the city center, Alpine Bikes in the TISO Outdoor
Centre, 50 Couper St. % 0141-552-8575, near Buchanan Bus Station
offers limited cycle rental. Prices start at £8 ($15).
On foot
As I say, walking Glasgow is the best way to see the city center and most
of the town (but using trains, buses, or taxis if the distances seem too
great is perfectly okay, too). Some boulevards (such as Buchanan or
Sauchiehall streets) have even been made into pedestrian malls. 
But as in any bustling metropolis that’s now rather over-dependent on
the use of cars, pedestrians should always exercise caution at intersec-
tions and other crossing points. Glasgow drivers (including those behind
the wheels of city buses) can be a tad aggressive at times. Remember:
Cars drive on the left, so when you cross a street, make certain to look
both ways.
Staying in Style
The tourist trade in Glasgow is less seasonal than in Edinburgh, with
fewer visitors in general coming to Scotland’s largest city. However,
Glasgow is a popular spot for business conferences, and the increase in
budget-airline flights from the European continent has clearly increased
the overall number of visitors. So if, for example, an international associ-
ation of dentists is in town, finding accommodations may be difficult.

Chapter 12: Glasgow 199

Whenever you decide to visit, I recommend that you reserve a room in
advance. Some rates are predictably high (especially so if the pound
remains strong), but many business-oriented hotels offer bargains on
weekends, and the number of budget options is increasing. Plus, the
Internet can be a real treasure trove of reduced room rates. The Glasgow
and Clyde Valley Tourism Office (www.visitscotland.com) offers a
National Booking &Information Service (% 0845-225-5121 from within
the U.K. and % 44-1506-832-121 from outside the U.K.). Lines are open
(local time) Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (until 5:30 p.m.
in the off season), Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and Sunday (during
the high season) from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The fee for this booking service
is £3 ($5.55).
The top hotels and B&Bs
ABode
$$$
Commercial Centre
Formerly the Arthouse hotel, this handsome Edwardian building, only a
few blocks from both Central and Queen Street train stations, was origi-
nally built to house school board offices. Today, it is a striking boutique
hotel in the city center. Dramatic colors and textures blend in perfectly
with the older structure while commissioned art and period pieces evoke
some of the original splendor. The eponymous fine-dining restaurant,
Michael Caines @ ABode, is under the direction of a Michelin-starred chef
in England (see my entry later in this chapter), while a more casual cafe
bistro is located in the basement, alongside the Vibe Bar.

($231) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Babbity Bowster
$–$$
Merchant City
Housed in a reconstructed late-18th-century house, the Babbity Bowster
is a small inn with fairly large character, due in part to the classic design
by brothers James and Robert Adam; the rest comes courtesy of the acer-
bic wit of owner Fraser Laurie (he with the eye patch). The units are
modest if reasonably well appointed. But the Babbity Bowster is for trav-
elers who don’t spend much time in their rooms. The location is conven-
ient to the many local pubs and restaurants in the nightlife hotbed of the
Merchant City — and you only have a five- to ten-minute walk to the heart
of central Glasgow. The Babbity’s ground-level pub is convivial and notably
civilized, with a sheltered beer garden, excellent bar meals, and live
acoustic Scottish folk sessions on Saturdays. The second-floor restaurant,
Schottische, offers French-influenced cooking in the evenings only.

Brunswick Hotel
$$
Merchant City
In the Merchant City, the Brunswick Hotel is one of the hippest places to
stay in Glasgow. The modern, minimalist design — from the popular
cafe/bar Brutti Ma Buoni to the bedrooms with their sleek look — has aged
well since the Brunswick’s opening in the 1990s. The units may be on the
small side but are soothing and inviting with neutral tones, comfortable
mattresses, and adequate bathrooms (several with both tub and shower).
For all its trendiness, however, the Brunswick is far from pretentiously run.
The owners are fun-loving cosmopolitans. Indeed, the cafe’s name literally
means “ugly but good,” which may accurately describe the misshapen
pizzas that the kitchen churns out but actually says more about the place’s
sense of humor.
See map p. 198. 106–108 Brunswick St. % 0141-552-0001. Fax: 0141-552-1551. www.
brunswickhotel.co.uk. Underground: Buchanan St. Rack rates: £55–£100
($102–$185) double; £400 ($740) penthouse suite. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE,
DC, MC, V.
Hilton Glasgow Hotel
$$$$
Commercial Centre
Glasgow’s first-class Hilton is centrally located but oddly situated over the
stretch of M8 freeway that slashes through the city of Glasgow. Perhaps the
caliber of guests ensures that they all take taxis or have private cars because
actually trying to get to and from the place on foot can be a bit of a night-
mare. Still, it is a dignified and modern hotel; one that has a good deal of
class and shine. The numerous units — plush and conservative — in the 20-
story building offer fine city views. Those staying on the executive floors
enjoy the enhanced facilities of a semiprivate club. Dining options include
a casual New York–deli-style buffet called Minsky’s, as well as the posh
Camerons with first-rate and expensive modern Scottish cuisine.

Cross. Rack rates: £100–£180 ($185–$333) double; from £140 ($259) suite. Weekend
discounts often available. AE, DC, MC, V.
Kelvingrove Hotel
$$
West End
Three generations of women in the Somerville family have made a differ-
ence to this guest house since buying it in October 2002. They are wel-
coming hoteliers with 30 years experience running small lodges in
Edinburgh, Inverness, and the isle of Arran. Usually Muriel, Valerie, or
Mandy are on duty during the day, orienting new arrivals, answering ques-
tions, booking cabs, or just generally conversing with visitors. The rooms
are comfortable with mainly modern furnishings, set within the converted
flats on the ground and garden levels. Room 24 is a particularly bright and
reasonably spacious family room with kitchenette.

Langs
$$$
Commercial Centre
This contemporary hotel close to Glasgow Royal Concert Hall calls itself
an urban oasis. The main public space is Oshi, a Zen-influenced bar and
restaurant with a 40-foot pool of water that runs between a waterfall and
cauldron of fire. Very impressive, if just a little over the top. Bedrooms in
various shapes, sizes, and configurations are available, and each room
offers a certain flair. The smallest units are the studios, but guests can opt
for a duplex, theme room, or a large suite. The beautiful bathrooms have
power showers with body jets. Visitors also can be pampered at the hotel’s
own spa. In addition to Oshi’s Asian fusion cuisine, Aurora offers excel-
lent Scottish produce such as Aberdeen Angus or fresh fish.

Malmaison
$$$
Charing Cross
Commercial Centre
Today there are hip and sophisticated Malmaisons across the U.K., but it
began in Scotland. This converted church with its fine Greek-styled exterior
(though not Greek Orthodox as Malmaison says but Episcopal) offers only
a few of the original details on the inside — the decor is sleek and modern.
In 1997, an annex designed to complement the architectural character of the
facade was added to provide additional guest rooms. Units vary in size from
quite cozy to average, but all are chic and well appointed with special extras
such as CD players, some specially commissioned art, and top-of-the-line
toiletries. In the vaulted spaces below reception is the popular brasserie
and champagne bar.

Millennium Hotel Glasgow
$$$$
George Square
Commercial Centre
Following a $5-million upgrade, this landmark hotel (once called the
Copthorne and erected at the beginning of the 19th century) has been
modernized with all the amenities and services you’d expect of any highly
rated hotel. Just off the boundary of the Merchant City and adjacent to
Queen Street Station, the hotel has a conservatory space for dining and
drinks. It faces the city’s central plaza, George Square, and offers views of
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
202

the opulent Glasgow city chambers. The best units are at the front of the
building; those in the rear offer no views worth writing home about. The
ground-floor restaurant, Brasserie on George Square, offers an elegant,
neo-colonial — but not stuffy — dining experience, while the hotel’s
Georgics Bar has an excellent selection of wines, many served by the glass.

One Devonshire Gardens
$$$$
West End
This hotel has become the most glamorous the city has to offer: the place
where the great and good traditionally stay, whether gorgeous George
Clooney or Michael Jackson. The converted townhouses were built in 1880
and are, possibly, more elegant today than in their heyday. Of the units,
number 29, the so-called luxury townhouse, is the most impressive. The
suite — £495 ($916) per night — includes a sitting room (with its own
toilet); a separate dressing chamber; a master bedroom with a four-poster
bed; and a full bathroom with spa, separate shower with computerized
controls, and twin basins. In summer 2006, new owners, Hotel du Vin, took
over.

Radisson SAS
$$$
Commercial Centre
Still shiny and new since its November 2002 opening, the Radisson has set
architectural standards for hotels in Glasgow. Its dramatic and curving
facade is just a stone’s throw from Central Station, but it’s in a slightly risky
location on the fringe of a portion of the City Centre that’s still being rede-
veloped. Contemporary units with blonde wood details and Scandinavian
cool have all the modern conveniences. The 13,935-sq.-m (15,000-sq.-ft.)
club and fitness facility includes a 15m (49-ft.) pool and state of the art
gym. Collage and TaPaell’ya offer two distinct dining options.

Town House
$$–$$$
West End
This remains one of the most charming of the city’s B&Bs — a less expen-
sive alternative to One Devonshire Gardens, which is just around the
corner. The terraced stone Victorian house faces the rugby fields of
Chapter 12: Glasgow 203

Hillhead sports grounds; the finely corniced entry hall and landing are dec-
orated with original artwork. The sitting room features a coal fire, while
the hotel provides a computer with high-speed Internet access. The only
possible gripe about the individual units may be that several have box
rooms that contain a shower, sink, and toilet in order to make all units en
suite. Otherwise, the hospitality, comfort, and ambience are excellent.

Runner-up hotels and B&Bs
Ambassador Hotel
$$
West End
Across from the Botanic Gardens, and overlooking the
Kelvin River, this small hotel in an early-20th-century Edwardian town
house is owned by the same people as the Albion. After a refurbishment
in 2002, the hotel is looking quite stylish. Each of the individually deco-
rated and attractively furnished bedrooms has a well-maintained bath-
room with tub and/or shower. The hotel is well-situated for exploring the
West End, with many good restaurants or brasseries nearby on Byres
Road. Suites are spacious enough to accommodate five to seven guests.

Argyll Hotel
$$
West End
The Argyll lives up to its Scottish name: full of tartan and
kilts. You almost expect this traditional feel to be part of a Highland lodge
rather than an urban inn. The hotel has a clutch of spacious family rooms,
and one double has a firm four-poster bed and corner-filling bathtub. See
map p. 198. 969–973 Sauchiehall St. % 0141-337-3313. Fax: 0141-337-3283. www.

Bewley’s Hotel
$–$$
Commercial Centre
This inn was sold in 2006, so I cannot guar-
antee that it will still be called the Bewley’s Hotel when you read this. The
inn rises impressively from street-level, with oddly angled windows that
appear to look down on the ground below. One basic room rate applies to
all, even for the larger units that can accommodate families. See map p. 198.
110 Bath St. % 0141-353-0800. Fax: 0141-353-0900. www.bewleyshotels.com.
City Inn
$$
West End
This smart hotel, with its waterside terrace, isn’t exactly
in the heart of the action — but neither is it very far away. Part of a small
chain with other hotels in London, Birmingham, Bristol, and Manchester,
the City Inn is modern and contemporary with good facilities. See map

Kirkland House
$$
West End
The Kirkland is a well-maintained Victorian house (circa
1832). A mix of antiques and reproductions are used in the large units,
where guests are served breakfast. Note: Credit cards are not accepted.

Kirklee Hotel
$$
West End
A red-sandstone Edwardian terraced house with elegant
bay windows near the West End’s diverse nightlife, the Kirklee is often rec-
ommended by locals. It’s graced with a rose garden that has won several
awards. Most of the high-ceilinged guest rooms are average size, but some
are large enough to accommodate families. See map p. 198. 11 Kensington Gate.

Rab Ha’s
$$
Merchant City
This small boutique hotel has overnight rooms above
a popular and urbane pub on the ground level as well as a modern restau-
rant in the basement. The units have dark slate flooring in the bathrooms,
specially commissioned glass, photographic prints, and flat-screen televi-
sions. See map p. 198. 83 Hutcheson St. % 0141-572-0400. Fax: 0141-572-0402. www.

Travel Inn
$–$$
Merchant City
A branch of an inexpensively priced chain of
hotels, this hotel is functional if not particularly full of character. A fair
amount of new construction is going on in the area, so the neighborhood
can be noisy during the day. Rooms that overlook the old kirkyard and
cemetery are preferable to those facing busy George Street and the
Strathclyde University parking lot across the road. See map p. 198. 187 George
St. % 0870-238-3320. Fax: 0141-553-2719. www.travelinn.co.uk.
Dining in Glasgow
Glasgow has welcomed a growing number of restaurants since the mid-
1990s, and your choices are diverse. Although the city may not boast 
the Michelin stars that a couple of Edinburgh restaurants have earned,
Glasgow has some seriously stylish dining rooms, budget-minded bistros,
and a mix of ethnic eateries.
Today, some of the best fresh Scottish produce is served up here,
whether it’s shellfish and seafood from the nearby West Coast sea lochs,
Ayrshire meat such as pork and lamb, or Aberdeen Angus steaks. You
can also find an ever-increasing number of ethnic restaurants. The immi-
grant groups who have most influenced cuisine in the city are Italians
and families from the Asian subcontinent, mainly the Punjab region.

Chapter 12: Glasgow 207

There’s a surfeit of Italian and Indian restaurants, as well as a decent
choice of Chinese and Greek restaurants.
A lot of restaurants close on Sunday or Monday (sometimes both), and
many lock up after lunch, reopening again for dinner at around 6 p.m.
The hours listed here are for when food is served; bars on the premises
may stay open longer.
For ideas on dining options, buy The List magazine’s annual Eating &
Drinking Guide, a comprehensive review of hundreds of eateries in
Glasgow (and Edinburgh).
Scotland is getting better at welcoming families, but it’s still a far cry
from the Continental approach of, say, Italy or France. That said, give the
local restaurants a try, and resist the temptation to resort to well-known
international chains or fast-food outlets.
Prices
Prices in general will seem expensive if you’re the type to immediately
convert pounds back into dollars. Still, a range of restaurant choices is
available for most budgets. The prices listed here include the 17.5 per-
cent VAT (value-added tax), so you shouldn’t see any hidden surprises
when the bill comes. If you’re looking for bargains, inquire about pre-
theater special menus, which can be as much as half the price of regular
dinner menus.
Lunch menus in Glasgow often offer the same food as the full dinner
menus but at a much better price. If you’re trying to save money on your
food bills, have a big late lunch or early meal in the evening.
Log onto www.5pm.co.uk for a list of restaurants offering early dining
deals.
Tipping
A gratuity of 10 percent is the norm for service, although leave nothing if
you were badly treated. On the other hand, if you were truly impressed
with the service you received, consider leaving 15 to 20 percent. In a few
restaurants, service is included in the bill automatically, but this charge
can be deleted if the service was dreadful.
Smoking
Generally speaking, when indoors, you can’t. Following a pattern set 
by nearby Ireland, as well as California and New York City, smoking is
prohibited by law from all enclosed public spaces in Scotland, which
includes restaurants and bars. Some places, however, may provide out-
door seating where smoking is allowed.

The top restaurants and cafes
Balbir’s 
$$
West End
INDIAN
After taking a break from running restaurants in Glasgow, Balbir Singh
Sumal returned in 2005 to open this sprawling place, serving first-class cur-
ries and other Indian specialties. Dishes are lighter than the norm, as his
chefs eschew ghee in favor of low-cholesterol rapeseed oil. The tandoori
oven is used to good effect with dishes, especially a starter of barbecued
salmon, served with freshly-made chutney. 
See map p. 206. 7 Church St. % 0141-339-7711. Underground: Kelvinhall. Main
courses: £6–£12 ($11–$22). AE, MC, V. Open: daily 5–10 p.m. 
Brian Maule at Chardon d’Or
$$$–$$$$
Commercial Centre
FRENCH/SCOTTISH
Chef Brian Maule was born in Ayrshire near Glasgow, but he trained with
some of the best chefs in France and became part of the team working with
the highly respected Roux brothers in London. After rising in rank to head
chef at their vaunted Michelin-star winning Gavroche restaurant, he
decided to go north and return to Scotland with his young family, opening
his own restaurant in Glasgow in 2001. His place is considered among the
finest in the city, with excellent ingredients and an ambience that’s classy
but not at all stuffy. Fresh fish and lamb dishes come highly recommended.
Smoking is not permitted in the dining room.
See map p. 206. 176 West Regent St. % 0141-248-3801. www.brianmaule.com.
Reservations recommended. Underground: Buchanan St. Main courses: £20–£24
($37–$44). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–2:30 p.m. and 6–10 p.m., Sat 6–10 p.m.
Closed Sun (and bank holidays).
The Buttery
$$$–$$$$
Commercial Centre
SCOTTISH/FRENCH
One of the best-known and longest established restaurants in Glasgow, the
Buttery exudes old world charm — from its rich, sumptuous bar and
lounge to the wood-paneled dining room with white linens. This restau-
rant and its Victorian tenement home have been standing here since 1870
or so. The Buttery seems out of the way only because it’s on “the wrong
side” of the M8 freeway that bisects the city. Although the setting is tradi-
tional, the cooking is progressive: rabbit served with roasted coriander
seed sauce or halibut with a pea puree. 
See map p. 206. 652 Argyle St. % 0141-221-8188. www.eatbuttery.com.
Reservations recommended. Suburban train: Anderston. Fixed-price lunch: £16 ($30);
fixed-price dinner: £34 ($63). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Tues–Fri noon–2 p.m. and 6–9:30 p.m.,
Sat 6–9:30 p.m. Closed Sun–Mon.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 209

Cafe Gandolfi
$$
Merchant City
SCOTTISH/CONTINENTAL
Many local foodies will tell you that this popular place in Merchant City is
among their favorite dining-out spots: It offers solid cooking and a friendly
ambience at the right price. Owner Seumas MacInnes comes from a
Highland/Hebredian family, and so the black pudding comes down from
Stornoway while the haggis hails from Dingwall. Particularly recom-
mended is the black pudding (a savory sausage made of pigs’ blood and
oats), Gandolfi’s creamy Cullen skink (smoked haddock chowder), or one
of the light pasta dishes. If you’re really hungry, go for the steak sandwich.
The ground floor room has original, organic, and comfortable wooden fur-
niture created by the Tim Stead workshop in Scotland. A recent addition
to the premises is Bar Gandolfi, up the steel staircase in the attic space.
With a ceiling skylight, however, it’s anything but dark and dank.
See map p. 206. 64 Albion St. % 0141-552-6813. www.cafegandolfi.com.
Underground: Buchanan St. Main courses: £6–£12 ($11–$22). MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat
9 a.m.–11:30 p.m., Sun noon–11:30 p.m.
Café Mao
$$
Merchant City
ASIAN
This restaurant’s a lively place for a meal, situated just north of the
Trongate in the Merchant City district. With the big Andy Warhol–style por-
traits of Chairman Mao prominently displayed in the window-filled corner
location, you can’t really miss the place. Part of a small chain of Asian
eateries curiously based in Ireland, Café Mao offers the casual setting of a
spacious, modern, and stylish bistro. The place can be quiet during
lunchtime, but it’s almost always hopping at night, with a buzz you would
expect more at a popular bar. Dishes include starters such as spring rolls
stuffed with pumpkin and main courses such as Indonesian nasi goreng
(fried rice) and Vietnamese beef and noodles, all prepared in the open
kitchen where you can see flames licking at the chefs’ bibs.
See map p. 206. 84 Brunswick St. % 0141-564-5161. www.cafemao.com.
Reservations recommended. Underground: St. Enoch. Fixed-price lunch: £9.50 ($18);
main courses: £8.50–£12 ($16–$22). AE, MC, V. Open: daily noon–11 p.m.
The Dhabba
$$–$$$
Merchant City
INDIAN
Glaswegians love their Indian food, as visitors can tell from the sheer
number of Indian restaurants in the city. However, the Dhabba, which
opened in late 2002, isn’t your typical Glasgow curry house; it’s a bit more
refined, slightly more expensive, and considerably more stylish than the
norm. In an attempt to be more authentic, the restaurant specializes in
north Indian dishes and foregoes the bright food coloring that so many
other restaurants use. In addition to spicy dishes featuring lamb, chicken,
and prawns, the menu also features an excellent selection of vegetarian
dishes, which are noticeably less costly than the meat options. Up the
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
210

street is Dhabba’s sister restaurant, Dakhin, which specializes in lighter
south Indian food.
See map p. 206. 44 Candleriggs. % 0141-553-1249. www.thedhabba.com.
Reservations recommended. Underground: St Enoch. Main courses: £8–£15
($15–$28). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–2 p.m. and 5–11 p.m., Sat–Sun 2–11 p.m.
Dragon-i 
$$–$$$
Commercial Centre
CHINESE/FAR EAST
Although its location is particularly convenient for the Theatre Royal, this
contemporary Chinese/Far Eastern restaurant would be a bigger hit if it
was on a slightly more central street. But as it’s only a few minutes walk
from Sauchiehall Street, it is hardly way out of the way. Expect the unex-
pected at the elegant Dragon-i, with cuisine that never falls into the bland
or typical chow mein or sweet-and-sour standards. Instead, the menu has
dishes such as tiger prawns with asparagus in a garlic chardonnay sauce or
chicken with sautéed apples and pineapples. The wine list is also excellent.
See map p. 206. 313 Hope St. % 0141-332-7728. www.dragon-i.co.uk.
Underground: Cowcaddens. Reservations recommended. Fixed-price lunch: £10
($19); dinner main courses: £11–£16 ($20–$30). AE, MC, V. Open: daily 5– 10 p.m.;
Mon–Sat noon–2 p.m. 
Chapter 12: Glasgow 211
Picnic fare
According to some translations, Glasgow, or glascau, means “dear green place.” And
this “dear green place” has no shortage of spots for a picnic, whether in sprawling
Glasgow Green or along the Clyde near the city center, Kelvingrove Park or the Botanic
Gardens in the West End, not to mention Pollok Country Park or Queens Park on the
Southside.
If you’re in the city center, gravitate towards Pekhams in the Merchant City near
George Square, 61 Glassford St. (% 0141-553-0666), which has a full delicatessen with
fresh bread and a wine shop.
In the West End, the options include the wonderful Heart Buchanan Fine Food and
Wine, near the Botanic Gardens at 380 Byres Rd. (% 0141-334-7626); Delizique, 66
Hyndland St. (% 0141-339-2000); another branch of Pekhams, 124 Byres Rd. (% 0141-
357-1454); and, new in 2004, Kember & Jones Fine Food Emporium, 134 Byres Rd. 
(% 0141-337-3851).
Next door to Kember & Jones is Patisserie Françoise, good for French-style pastries
and breads. For some of the best cheese in the U.K., visit the IJ Mellis Cheesemonger
branch in Glasgow at 492 Great Western Rd. (% 0141-339-8998). Towards the City
Centre area is the Glasgow branch of Lupe Pintos at 313 Great Western Rd. (% 0141-
334-5444), the perfect stop for Mexican and American foodstuffs. On the Southside in
the Shawlands district near Queens Park, the 1901 Deli (11 Skirving St.; % 0141-632-
1630) has a good supply of goodies for any outdoor feast.

étain
$$$
Commercial Centre
SCOTTISH/FRENCH
Adjacent to a branch of Zinc Bar & Grill, étain (French for pewter) offers
fine dining at the top of the Princes Square shopping center. You enter the
restaurant either through the mall and via Zinc, or by using a dedicated
glass elevator from a rear ally accessed by Queen Street. However you
arrive, the food will feature contemporary French cooking using Scottish
produce: whether lobster, lamb, scallops, crab, or venison. Memorable
little touches include handmade truffles served after dinner. Service is gen-
erally excellent although perhaps a bit sniffy on occasion.
See map p. 206. The Glass House, Springfield Court. % 0141-225-5630. Reservations
recommended. Underground: Buchanan St. Fixed-price lunch: £16 ($30); main
courses dinner: £14–£20 ($26–$37). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon–2:30 p.m. and
7–11 p.m., Sat 6–11 p.m., Sun noon–3 p.m.
Fratelli Sarti
$–$$
Commercial Centre
ITALIAN
Owned by the Sarti brothers, this dual restaurant and cafe feels like a
family-run cafe/bistro crossed with a delicatessen. Indeed, you can still
buy dried goods and wines here, although they stopped carrying deli
meats and cheeses a couple of years ago. The pizzas are excellent, with
thin, crispy crusts and modest amounts of sauce, cheese, and toppings,
which prevent them from becoming a sloppy mess. Pasta dishes, such as
“al forno” with penne, sausage, and spinach, are filling. Come here even if
you just want a real Italian espresso and pastry. If you want a slightly more
formal setting, try the Fratelli Sarti on 21 Renfield St. (% 0141-572-7000).
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
212
Family-friendly fare
Just off Sauchiehall Street, Bistro du Sud, 97 Cambridge St (% 0141-332-2666), is a
small, locally-owned cafe/bistro that loves to have children in its midst. Instead of
being lulled by the familiar multinational chain operations, try something tasty at this
modern Italian/French eatery open daily from 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. (from noon on Sun).
Just like in Edinburgh, the all you can eat buffet-only Chinese restaurant has taken
Glasgow by storm. China Buffet King, 349 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-333-1788), is cen-
trally located, with a good variety of Chinese food and some European dishes, at dis-
count prices for children. Open daily from noon to 11 p.m.
A “Knickerbocker Glory” is an extremely elaborate ice-cream sundae (with fruit, jelly,
and more) and few places do it better than the University Café, 87 Byres Rd (% 0141-
339-5217). This Art Deco landmark has all its original features, from booths to counter.
Open Wednesday through Monday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. or so.

See map p. 206. 133 Wellington St. % 0141-204-0440. www.fratellisarti.com.
Underground: Buchanan St. Reservations recommended. Main courses: £6–£10
($11–$19). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–10:30 p.m., Sat 8 a.m.–11 p.m., Sun
noon–10:30 p.m.
Gamba
$$$$
Commercial Centre
FISH/SEAFOOD
This basement venture is modern and stylish without feeling excessively
fancy. Diners often begin with a cocktail or glass of champagne in the small
bar where they can look at the menu and order before moving through to
the dining room. Starters include a signature fish soup or a sashimi dish
with succulent slices of salmon and scallops. Main courses may include
whole lemon sole in browned butter or delicate pan-seared sea bream. And
desserts aren’t an afterthought, whether smooth panna cotta or ice cream
infused with Scotch whisky. Nothing here is cheap, but it feels like value
nonetheless. If you’re on a tight budget, try the lunch or pre-theater fixed-
price menu. 
See map p. 206. 225a West George St. % 0141-572-0899. www.gamba.co.uk.
Reservations required. Underground: Buchanan St. Fixed-price lunch: £16 ($30); main
courses dinner: £19–£26 ($35–$48). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon–2:30 p.m. and
5–10:30 p.m. Closed Sun.
Grassroots Café
$
West End
VEGETARIAN
Tied to the whole-foods shop located just around the corner, Grassroots
is the city’s leading vegetarian restaurant. The feel is casual and relaxed,
with sofas at the front of the dining space and booths separated by gauzy
curtains along one wall. A good selection of nonalcoholic fruit drinks and
organic bottled beers from Britain complement a menu that has interna-
tional influences. Cakes of risotto-style rice with goat cheese and pine nuts,
tempura-battered vegetables, and a Middle Eastern tagine with couscous
are delicious examples of what you’ll find here.
See map p. 206. 93–97 St. Georges Rd. (parallel to the M8 freeway). % 0141-333-0534.
Underground: St. George’s Cross. Main courses: £5–£8 ($9.25–$15). MC, V. Open:
Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–10 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–3:45 p.m. and 5–10 p.m.
Ho Wong
$$$
Broomielaw/Commercial Centre
CHINESE
One of the city’s fanciest Chinese restaurants, this classy establishment is
on a rather inauspicious block between the river and Argyle Street, just
southwest of Glasgow’s Central Station. The ambience is refined and even
a bit romantic. There are traditionally at least eight duck dishes on the
menu, along with a few types of fresh lobster, plenty of fish options, and
some sizzling platters as well. If you have trouble deciding, the banquet
option makes life a bit easier.

La Parmigiana
$$$
West End
ITALIAN
This remains the favorite fine-dining Italian restaurant in Glasgow, provid-
ing a cosmopolitan and Continental atmosphere. A well-established, 
quarter-of-a-century old business of the Giovanazzi family, Parmigiana is
often recommended for its fish and meat dishes, whether grilled salmon
with honey roasted vegetables, pan-fried pork cutlet with caramelized
apples, or roast breast of guinea fowl stuffed with porcini mushrooms. A
highlight of the pasta options is lobster ravioli with basil cream sauce. The
house wine is excellent, but the list affords the opportunity to sample
some fine vintages at corresponding costs. Service by waiters in smart
black vests is usually impeccable.

merly the Arthouse; see hotel entry earlier in this chapter) has similar aspi-
rations. It is hard to find fault with cooking and presentation, such as seared
red mullet with slivers of zucchini, dabs of tomato sauce, and some eggplant
puree rounded off with a frothy fennel cream. The dining room is modern
and stylish, as you would expect in a boutique hotel such as ABode. In addi-
tion to fine dining restaurant, there is a cafe bar in the basement.

Mono

Saltmarket
VEGAN
Technically just south of the Merchant City, Mono is my choice for a basic
meat-free meal in this part of town. Not just a bar and a cafe/restaurant,
Mono also houses a store selling free-trade goods and a CD shop with the
latest in indie rock and alternative music. The restaurant’s completely
vegan (that means no dairy products, either), which makes Mono unique

in Scotland, let alone Glasgow. If this all sounds a tad too “politically cor-
rect,” relax: It’s a welcoming and casual place with a mixed and varied
clientele. Live music is featured some nights, and thus the kitchen may
shut early.

Mother India
$$–$$$
West End
INDIAN
After more than a decade in business, Mother India has established itself
as the most respected Indian restaurant in Glasgow. Others have been
open longer and certainly have their own loyal followings, but Mother
India is the one place that people in the know most often recommend.
Unlike the norm for Indian restaurants, the menu here isn’t overloaded
with hundreds of different dishes. Oven-baked fish, which comes wrapped
in foil, is seasoned with aromatic spices, while chicken and zucchini
squash are served with a sauce that includes pan-roasted cumin and car-
damom. Whether seated on the ground floor or in the dining room above,
diners are likely to find the staff courteous and attentive. Recently a third
dining space, the Cellar, was added to the premises.
Down the road toward the Kelvingrove Gallery another branch of Mother
India with less expensive, small thali-style dishes is worth a stop if you’re
on a budget: Mother India’s Café (% 0141-339-9145).
See map p. 206. 28 Westminster Terrace (Sauchiehall Street at Kelvingrove Street).
% 0141-221-1663. www.motherindia.co.uk. Reservations required. Underground:
Kelvinhall. Main courses: £7.50–£12 ($14–$22). Open: Mon–Tues 5:30–10:30 p.m.,
Wed–Thurs noon–2 p.m. and 5:30–10:30 p.m., Fri noon–2:30 p.m. and 5:30–11 p.m., Sat
1–11 p.m., Sun 4:30–10 p.m.
Mussel Inn
$$–$$$
Commercial Centre
FISH/SEAFOOD
Sister restaurant to the original on Rose Street in Edinburgh, the Mussel
Inn has the distinction of being owned by shellfish farmers in the West of
Scotland. The kilo pot of mussels you eat here on any given evening may
have been harvested only earlier the same day. The feel at the Glasgow
branch is casual, with an open kitchen, light wood tables, and high ceil-
ings, re-creating the feel you may find if it were located right at the
seashore. In addition to the house specialty of steamed mussels served
with a choice of broths (from spicy to white wine with garlic), the queen
scallop salad is tasty and refreshing, creamy chowders are hearty and fill-
ing, and the menu always features a fresh catch of the day.
See map p. 206. 157 Hope St. % 0141-572-1405. www.mussel-inn.com.
Reservations recommended for weekend nights. Underground: St. Enoch. Main

1901
$$
Southside
FRENCH/CONTINENTAL
Not too far from the Burrell Collection, 1901 is perhaps your best choice
for a meal after a visit to Pollok Park. The owner once ran a French restau-
rant in the city, and the décor of the dining room, which is back behind
the traditional pub, nods to this background with its use of blue, white,
and red. The menu offers a range of French-influenced and Continental
food, almost all served in large portions. Dishes include lamb shanks with
garlic and thyme, pasta with chicken, or the classic steak frites.
See map p. 206. 1534 Pollokshaws Rd. % 0141-632-0161. Reservations recommended.
Fixed-price lunch: £7.50 ($14); main courses: £11–£15 ($20–$28). MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri
noon–2:30 p.m. and 5–9:30 p.m., Sat–Sun noon–9:30 p.m.
No. Sixteen
$$–$$$
West End
SCOTTISH
No. Sixteen has a neighborhood feel to it, small and slightly cramped with
dining on the ground floor and a tiny mezzanine above. But its appeal
extends far beyond those who happen to live nearby. The story’s been told
of a couple visiting Glasgow, who came here on their first night in town for
dinner and returned every subsequent night because they were so pleased
with the food. Near the base of Byres Road, this Scottish bistro offers
inventive cooking of local ingredients: braised pig cheek with purple
endive or pan-fried filet of mackerel with olive-crushed potatoes, for exam-
ple, on daily changing menus. The pre-theater menu offers excellent value.
See map p. 206. 16 Byres Rd. % 0141-339-2544. Reservations recommended.
Underground: Kelvinhall. Fixed-price lunch: £12 ($22); main courses: £12–£20
($22–$37). AE, MC, V. Open: daily noon–2:30 p.m. and 5:30–9:30 p.m.
Rogano
$$$–$$$$
Commercial Centre
FISH/SEAFOOD
Sold to new owners in 2006, Rogano boasts a well-preserved Art Deco 
interior patterned after the Queen Mary ocean liner that dates back to the
opening of the oyster bar here in 1935. Since then, the space has expanded,
and Rogano has hosted virtually every visiting celebrity to the city. You
can enjoy dinner amid etched mirrors, ceiling fans, semicircular ban-
quettes, and potted palms. Service is attentive and informed. The menu
emphasizes seafood, such as halibut in champagne-and-oyster sauce or
lobster Thermidor. While these are traditional if possibly old-fashioned
recipes, they have their fans. A less expensive menu is offered downstairs
in Cafe Rogano, which serves food straight through the day and where
the prices of main courses hover around the £12 ($22) mark.

Stravaigin Café Bar
$$
West End
SCOTTISH/GLOBAL
The motto of Stravaigin (which roughly translates from the Scottish ver-
nacular to “wanderin” in English), is “think global, eat local.” Although the
fine-dining restaurant in the basement has won awards, I tend to prefer the
less expensive but still memorable food served at the ground level
pub/cafe, which serves food all day long. Scottish produce gets interna-
tional twists: cheese and herb fritters with sweet chili sauce or roast lamb
served with coriander couscous. But you also find staples such as hearty
fish and chips. The atmosphere is always cordial, and prices are lower still
during the busy pre-theater seating. In the downstairs restaurant, expect
concoctions such as Vietnamese-inspired marinated quail served on a
candy smoked eggplant concasse or mullet served on a bed of Thai noo-
dles with bits of mussels and mushrooms. If you like Stravaigin, you may
consider visiting its sister bistro near Byres Road, called, appropriately
enough, Stravaigin 2, Ruthven Lane (% 0141-334-7156).
See map p. 206. 28 Gibson St. % 0141-334-2665. www.stravaigin.com.

11 a.m.–10:30 p.m.
Ubiquitous Chip
$$$$
West End
SCOTTISH
Quite possibly no other restaurant has been more responsible for the culi-
nary renaissance in Scotland than the Ubiquitous Chip. Opening the Chip
in 1971, chef/owner Ronnie Clydesdale was ahead of the curve, bringing
the best Scottish ingredients into his kitchen — and then to the attention
of diners. To this day, the menus state the provenance of the produce, a
practice now commonplace in better restaurants. Inside the walls of a
former stable, the recently renovated dining room has a roomy interior
courtyard with a fountain and masses of climbing vines. The menu can fea-
ture free-range chicken, Aberdeen Angus beef, shellfish with crispy sea-
weed snaps, or wild rabbit. Upstairs, there’s a friendly pub and small
brasserie (Upstairs at the Chip), which serves similar quality fare at a frac-
tion of the price.
See map p. 206. 12 Ashton Lane, off Byres Road. % 0141-334-5007. www.ubiquitous

11 p.m.; brasserie daily noon–11 p.m.
Wee Curry Shop

INDIAN
This tiny place is hardly big enough to swing a cat in, but the aptly named
Wee Curry Shop offers the best low-cost Indian dishes in the city. Just
about five tables are crammed between the front door and the open
Chapter 12: Glasgow 217

kitchen where the chefs prepare everything to order. The menu is concise,
with a clutch of opening courses, such as fried pakora, and a half dozen or
so main courses, such as spicy chile garlic chicken. Despite the cheap
prices, portions are large. Although it may feel off the beaten track, the
Wee Curry Shop is actually only a short walk from the shopping precincts
of Sauchiehall Street. 
See map p. 206. 7 Buccleuch St. (near Cambridge Street). % 0141-353-0777.
Reservations recommended. Underground: Cowcaddens. Fixed-price lunch: £4.75
($8.90); main courses: £5–£7 ($9.25–$13). Open: Mon–Sat noon–2 p.m. and 5:30–
10:30 p.m. Sun 5–7 p.m.
Where the Monkey Sleeps
$
Commercial Centre
CAFE
Near Blythswood Square, this singular basement cafe-cum-gallery is one of
the best places for cappuccinos, soups, and sandwiches in the Commercial
Centre area of Glasgow. You know you’ve found it when you see all the
waiting messenger bikes, the riders of which seem to live here when
they’re not on the streets delivering special letters and business packages.
As the name indicates, Where the Monkey Sleeps is no ordinary cafe; it’s
owned and operated by artistic types (including two graduates from the
nearby Art School) who learned their barista skills at Starbucks but
wanted to be free of corporate constraints.
See map p. 206. 182 West Regent St. % 0141-226-3406. www.wherethemonkey

Tea for two?
For tea and a snack, join the rest of the tourists in Glasgow and try to secure a 
table at the landmark Willow Tea Rooms, 217 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-332-0521;
Underground: Cowcaddens). When the famed Mrs. Cranston opened the Willow Tea
Rooms in 1904, it was something of a sensation due to its unique Charles Rennie
Mackintosh design. The building’s white facade still stands out from the crowd more
than 100 years later. The dining room (one floor above street level) is open Monday to
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. A second branch on
Buchanan Street is similarly appointed if less authentic.
For a more contemporary experience, in the West End overlooking the River Kelvin,
Tchai Ovna, 42 Otago St. (% 0141-357-4524), has a selection of some 80 teas served
in fairly eccentric and bohemian surroundings. In the evenings, you may find live
music, poetry, or comedy. Tchai Ovna is open daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.

The Wild Bergamot 
$$$
Milngavie (Near West End)
SCOTTISH 
Chef and proprietor Alan Burns took over this tiny restaurant, formerly
known as Gingerhill, in the northwestern suburbs of Glasgow and has put
it on the culinary map. The cooking is assured and innovative, with empha-
sis placed on seasonal Scottish ingredients. A small lounge serves canapés
and takes dinner orders before guests move to the cozy dining room.
Dishes change regularly and can include almond-crusted halibut with
braised oxtail or roast rump and lavender braised shoulder of Scottish
lamb. Intermediate courses add a special touch. It’s worth finding your
way to Milngavie to eat here.
See map p. 206. 1 Hillhead St., Milngavie. Near Milngavie railway station; off the A81,
about 9km (6 miles) northwest of Glasgow city center. % 0141-956-6515. www.

fixed-price dinner £30 ($56); tasting menu £45 ($83). MC, V. Wed–Sun 7–9:30 p.m.;
Fri–Sat noon–2 p.m. Closed Mon–Tues.
Exploring Glasgow
Glasgow is a compact city that’s roughly the size of San Francisco. The
part that many visitors may describe as “downtown,” Glasgow’s city
center is laid out on a grid, so the commercial heart of the metropolis is
user-friendly. Most visits begin here, amid the rich Victorian architec-
ture, whether 19th-century banks (many of which have been converted
to other uses such as restaurants and bars), office buildings, ware-
houses, or churches. Culturally, the choices in the heart of Glasgow
include the Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA), the Lighthouse (devoted to
design and architecture), and the Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA).
These are all within a fairly short walking distance of one another. Three
main boulevards — Argyle, Buchanan, and Sauchiehall streets — form a
Z-shape and have been made into predominantly car-free pedestrian
zones that offer a wealth of shopping opportunities.
Adjacent to the Commercial Centre is the Merchant City, where loft con-
versions over the past 20 years have created a hip, happening quarter
with many lively bars and restaurants. This district skirts the historic
heart of Glasgow, but little if anything remains of the medieval city —
most of it has been knocked down over the years in various urban
renewal schemes. But at either end of the historic High Street, you can
see two of the city’s more ancient landmarks: Glasgow Cathedral, which
dates to the 13th century, and the Renaissance Tolbooth steeple.
The affluent and urbane West End has the city’s top university and the
Scottish headquarters (until a planned move south of the river takes
place) of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The presence of
these institutions ensures that this area is trendy and lively, with some
of the city’s best restaurants and nightlife. Leafy and attractive, with 
the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum fabulously refurbished and

Chapter 12: Glasgow 221

reopened in 2006, the West End is a favorite place for many visitors to
explore.
Of course, a river runs through Glasgow, but the city has yet to capital-
ize fully on the real potential of the Clyde. The shipbuilding that made
the river famous is long gone, yet there isn’t even an active, attractive
marina for leisure boats today. Concrete redevelopment of the water-
front done toward the end of the 20th century hasn’t aged particularly
well, although the riverbank, which has a national bicycle path, has a
certain run-down urban charm.
On the other side of the River Clyde, the Southside spreads out with
mostly residential neighborhoods. Some say this is the “real” Glasgow,
and it’s home to at least one major, arguably world-class attraction, the
Burrell Collection, as well as several other destinations that merit
excursions south of the River Clyde. 
At all of Glasgow’s city-run museums, from the Gallery of Modern Art to
the Burrell Collection, seeing the permanent exhibitions costs you
absolutely nothing.
You’d need at least a few days to visit every place listed in this section
and you’d be more than exhausted by the end of your romp, so you’ll
have to make some decisions. If you have children in tow, fewer galleries
and more family attractions would be best; if you like art, more muse-
ums and fewer wanders may be right up your alley.
The top attractions
Botanic Gardens
West End
Glasgow’s Botanic Gardens aren’t as extensive or exemplary as the Royal
Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh. Nevertheless, they cover some 11 hectares
(28 acres). An extensive collection of tropical plants lives in Kibble Palace,
the Victorian cast iron glasshouse that was being restored in 2006. The
plant collection includes some rather acclaimed orchids and begonias.
The Botanic Gardens is a good place to unwind and wander, whether
through the working vegetable plot or along the banks of the River Kelvin.
See map p. 220. Great Western Road. % 0141-334-2422. Admission: free.
Underground: Hillhead. Bus: 20, 66, or 90. Open: gardens daily dawn–dusk; green-
houses daily 10 a.m.–4:45 p.m. (only until 4:15 p.m. in the winter).
The Burrell Collection
Southside
This museum houses the treasures left to Glasgow by Sir William Burrell,
a wealthy ship owner and industrialist who had a lifelong passion for art.
He started collecting at age 14 and stopped only when he died at the age of
96 in 1958. His tastes were eclectic: Chinese ceramics, French paintings

from the 1800s, tapestries, stained-glass windows from churches, even
stone doorways from the Middle Ages. You can see a vast aggregation of
furniture, textiles, ceramics, stained glass, silver, art objects, and pictures
in the dining room, hall, and drawing room reconstructed from Sir William’s
home, Hutton Castle at Berwick-upon-Tweed. Ancient artifacts, Asian art,
and European decorative arts and paintings are all featured. There’s a cafe
on site, and you can also roam through the surrounding park.
Nearby Pollok House (% 0141-616-6521) dates to the 18th century. Now
run by the National Trust for Scotland, it features interiors as they were in
the Victorian/Edwardian era. Open daily with an admission charge of £8
($15) adults.

Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA)
Commercial Centre
The CCA is dedicated to the exhibition of cutting-edge art — usually of a
conceptual nature — by both local artists, and those with international
reputations. The main central and atriumlike space is actually given over
to the CCA’s cafe, but there are other exhibition rooms, plus a small the-
ater, where art-house and foreign films coordinated by the Glasgow Film
Theatre are screened. Housed in a restored building designed by
Alexander “Greek” Thomson, the CCA annually hosts art by the nominees
for the Beck Futures Awards, which has become one of the leading judges
of young talent in Britain.

Gallery of Modern Art
Merchant City
GOMA, as it’s better known, is housed in the former Royal Exchange at
Royal Exchange Square, where Ingram Street terminates at Queen Street.
The building was built as a mansion for an 18th-century tobacco magnate.
It was later expanded by one of the city’s busy 19th-century architects,
David Hamilton, who added a dramatic portico to the front. The galleries
on different floors are slightly pretentiously named after earth, fire, air, and
water. The permanent collection has works by Stanley Spencer and John
Bellany as well as art from the “new Glasgow boys” who emerged in the
1980s — Peter Howson, Ken Currie, and Steven Campbell. Before becom-
ing a museum in the mid-1990s, the building was used as a public library
and recently the basement was converted to serve that function again.

Glasgow Cathedral
Townhead
Also known as the cathedral of St. Kentigern or St. Mungo’s, this structure
dates to the 13th century. The edifice is mainland Scotland’s only complete
medieval cathedral, making it (along with St. Magnus on Orkney) the most
important ecclesiastical building of that era in the entire country. Unlike
other cathedrals on the mainland, this one survived the Reformation prac-
tically intact, but 16th-century zeal purged it of all monuments of idolatry.
Later, misguided “restoration” led to the demolition of its western towers,
thus altering the cathedral’s appearance. Gothic design reigns in the lower
Church, which has an array of pointed arches and piers. Its vaulted crypt
is said to be one of the finest in Europe and holds St. Mungo’s tomb, where
a light always burns. Other highlights of the interior include the
Blackadder aisle and the 15th-century nave with a stone screen (unique in
Scotland) showing the seven deadly sins.
For one of the best views of the cathedral — and the city, for that matter —
I urge you to cross the ravine into the Central Necropolis. Built on a proud
hill and dominated by a statue of John Knox, this graveyard (modeled in
part after the famous Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris) was opened in the
1830s.

Glasgow School of Art
Garnethill/Commercial Centre
Architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s global reputation rests in large part
on this magnificent building on Garnethill above Sauchiehall Street, a high-
light of the Mackintosh trail that legions of his fans from across the world
follow through the city. Completed in two stages (1899 and 1909), the build-
ing offers a mix of ideas promoted by the Arts and Crafts as well as the Art
Nouveau movements. The building is even more amazing because
Mackintosh was not yet 30 when he designed the place. It’s still a working
and much respected school of art. Guided tours are the only way to see the
entire building, and a highlight of the tour is the library. If you just drop in,
however, there’s a good gift shop near the front doors, and the airy landing
one flight up serves as the school’s exhibition space: the Mackintosh Gallery.

Holmwood House
Southside
This villa, designed by Alexander “Greek” Thomson and built in 1858, is
probably the best example of his innovative style as applied to stately
Victorian homes. Holmwood House is magnificently original, and its restora-
tion (which is ongoing) has revealed that the architect was concerned with
almost every element of the house’s design, right down to the wallpaper and
painted friezes. Visitors have access to most parts of the building and sur-
rounding gardens. Most impressive is the overall exterior design as well as
the home’s parlor with its circular bay window, the cupola over the stair-
case, and the detailed cornicing around the ceiling in the dining room.

Chapter 12: Glasgow 225
Unappreciated genius: Alexander 
“Greek” Thomson
Even though architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868–1928) is well
known and his worldwide popularity has spurred a cottage industry of “mock-intosh”
fakes from jewelry to stationery, a precursor of his was perhaps even more important
and innovative. Alexander “Greek” Thomson (1817–1875) brought a vision to Victorian
Glasgow that was unrivaled by his contemporaries. Although the influence of classi-
cal Greek structures — the so-called Greek Revival — was nothing new, Thomson
didn’t so much replicate Grecian design as hone it to essentials and then mix in
Egyptian, Assyrian, and other Eastern-influenced motifs. As with Mackintosh later,
Thomson increasingly found himself out of step with fashion, which architecturally
was moving toward Gothic Revival.
An unforgivable number of structures created by the reasonably prolific and suc-
cessful Thomson have been lost to the wrecker’s ball, but some key works remain: ter-
raced houses such as Moray Place (where he lived) in the city’s Southside and Eton
Terrace in the West End, churches such as the derelict Caledonian Road Church and
the still-used St. Vincent Street Church, detached homes such as the Double Villa and
Holmwood House, and commercial structures such as the Grecian Buildings (which
today houses the CCA) and Egyptian Halls. Just as a Mackintosh trail has been cre-
ated so that fans can revisit his works, Thomson deserves no less and in time may
receive his full due.

many hanging in this gallery. The main space exhibits 17th- and 18th-
century paintings (Rembrandt to Rubens) and 19th- and 20th-century
Scottish works, including works by the so-called Glasgow Boys and the
“Scottish Colourists,” such as Cadell, Hunter, and Fergusson. Temporary
exhibits, selected from Scotland’s largest collection of prints, are presented
in the print gallery. The Hunterian also boasts a collection of Charles Rennie
Mackintosh furnishings, and one wing of the building has a re-creation of
architect’s Glasgow home from 1906 to 1914 — startling then and no less so
today. The Mackintosh House covers three levels, decorated in the origi-
nal style of the famed architect and his artist wife Margaret Macdonald. All
salvageable fittings and fixtures were recovered from the original home
before it was demolished in the mid-1960s. The re-creation mimics the orig-
inal house; the sequence of the rooms is identical.

Ahead of his time: Charles Rennie
Mackintosh
Although he’s legendary today, architect, designer, and decorater Charles Rennie
Mackintosh (1868–1928) was largely forgotten in Scotland at the time of his death. His
approach, poised between the Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau eras, had its fans,
however, and history has compensated for any slights he received during his lifetime.
Mackintosh used forms of nature, especially plants, in his interior design motifs, which
offered simplicity and harmony that was not the Victorian fashion. Nonetheless, in
1896, Mackintosh’s design for the Glasgow School of Art won a prestigious competi-
tion. Other Mackintosh landmark buildings in the city include the exterior of the old
Glasgow Herald building, now The Lighthouse, the Willow Tea Rooms on Sauchiehall
Street, and the Scotland Street School. His West End home from 1906 to 1914 (with
wife and collaborator Margaret Macdonald) was itself a work of art, eschewing the
fussy clutter of the age for clean, elegant lines. Its interiors have been recreated by
the University of Glasgow’s Hunterian Gallery. Twenty-five miles west of Glasgow in
Helensburgh is perhaps his greatest singular achievement: Hill House, designed for
publisher Walter Blackie in 1902.
Later failures to win commissions locally led Mackintosh to move out of Glasgow, to
the southern coast of England and later to Port Vendres in France. In both places, how-
ever, his artistic talents were not wasted. He painted watercolors of flowers and land-
scapes that are as distinctive as his architectural and interior design work.

Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum 
West End
Although the Burrell Collection (see earlier) may be the star, the newly
refurbished Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum presents the stirring soul
of the city’s collection, one of the best amassed by a municipality in Europe.
Reopened in 2006 after a three-year and several million pound refurbish-
ment, the Kelvingrove can boast that it is most visited gallery and museum
in Scotland — the most popular in the U.K. outside of those in London. The
space features French impressionists and 17th-century Dutch and Flemish
paintings. One painting of particular note is Christ of St. John the Cross by
Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí. Purchased at great expense by the city, it
has been returned to its original position in the hall after a stint at the city’s
St. Mungo Museum (see later in this chapter). Other highlights include
paintings by the Scottish Colourists and the Glasgow Boys, a wing devoted
to Mackintosh, as well as more recent art by Anne Redpath and Joan
Eardley. But there is more than art, with exhibits on Scottish and Glasgow
history, armory and war, as well as natural history and nature — often
mixing all to good educational effect, such as showing how human armor
copied the natural protection of some animals, such as the armadillo. There
are plenty of interactive displays and touches of humor, too, like the crea-
ture that supposedly is responsible for the traditional dish, haggis. The
building itself, built for the 1901 Glasgow International Exhibition, is mag-
nificent as well. In the semi-basement is a new cafe/restaurant.

Underground: Kelvinhall. Bus: 9, 16, 42, or 62. Admission: free, except for some tem-
porary exhibits. Mon–Thurs and Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Fri and Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m. 
People’s Palace
East End
This museum reveals the social history of Glasgow through exhibits on
how “ordinary people” have lived in the city, especially since the indus-
trial age. It also attempts to explain the Glasgow vernacular — speech pat-
terns and expressions that even Scots from outside the city can have
trouble deciphering. Further noteworthy are the murals painted by “new
Glasgow boy” Ken Currie. In front of the museum is the recently restored
Doulton Fountain, which was moved here from another spot on Glasgow
Green. The spacious Winter Gardens to the rear of the building, in a
restored Victorian glass house with cafe facility, offers a nice retreat.

congregation that worships here. Nevertheless, the church remains the
most visible landmark attributed to the city’s other great architect,
Alexander “Greek” Thomson. Built originally for Presbyterians in 1859, the
stone edifice offers two classic Greek porticos facing north and south,
aside which a clock tower rises, decorated in all manner of exotic yet curi-
ously sympathetic Egyptian, Assyrian, and even Indian-looking motifs and
designs. The interior is surprisingly colorful.

Science Centre
Govan/Southside
The Science Centre has been called Britain’s most successful “millennium
project,” but with so many stinkers (notably London’s Dome) constructed
to commemorate the year 2000, that compliment can be read as faint
praise. Indeed, a millennium jinx has hit even here. 
The tall, slender tower topped by an observatory room was designed to
give breathtaking views. But it closed shortly after the Science Centre
opened in 2001. While reopening briefly, more problems were encountered
and it remained off-limits in 2006. 
Still, on the banks of the River Clyde and opposite the Scottish Exhibition
and Conference Centre, this futuristic-looking museum is a focal point of
Glasgow’s drive to redevelop the rundown former dock lands. The overall
theme of the exhibitions is to document 21st-century challenges as well
as Glasgow’s contribution to science and technology in the past, present,
and future. Families should enjoy the hands-on and interactive activities:
whether taking a three-dimensional head scan or starring into their own
digital video. The Science Centre also is home to a planetarium and the
silver-skinned IMAX Theater, which uses a film with a frame size some ten
times larger than the standard 35mm film. The planetarium and theater
charge separate admission.

Tenement House
Garnethill/Commercial Centre
Tenements (or apartment buildings) are what many Glaswegians lived in
from the middle of the 19th century. And many still do so today. Run by the
National Trust for Scotland, this “museum” is a typical flat, preserved with
all the fixtures and fittings from the early part of the 20th century: coal
fires, box bed in the kitchen, and gas lamps. Indeed, the resident, Miss
Agnes Toward, apparently never threw out anything from 1911 to 1965, so

More cool things to do and see
City Chambers
Merchant City
Located on George Square, Glasgow’s city hall is even more impressive on
the inside than on the outside. Even if you don’t take the free tour, at least
pop your head in to see the cruciform front hall (the only part open to vis-
itors who don’t take the tour). Ceiling-tile work and magnificent marble
columns appear throughout the building. In fact, the palatial interior has
been used in many films as a stand-in for both the Vatican and the Kremlin,
as well as for an interior shot in Dr. Zhivago. The office of the city’s Lord
Provost (the honorary mayor) is here as well. Outside, Yanks might note
a mini Statue of Liberty atop the facade, just below the flag.

Glasgow Green
East End
Glasgow Green is the city’s oldest park, probably dating from medieval
times. Running along the River Clyde southeast of the Commercial Centre
and Merchant City, this huge stretch of green had paths laid and shrubs
planted in the middle of the 18th century but didn’t formally became a
public park until some 100 years later. Its landmarks include the People’s
Palace (see listing earlier in this chapter) social history museum and
adjoining Winter Garden, the Doulton Fountain, and Nelson’s Monument.
At one end of the green, the influence of the Doges’ Palace in Venice can
be seen in the colorful facade of the old Templeton Carpet Factory. Near
here is a large children’s play area. The southern side of Glasgow Green
offers dulcet walks along the river.

Mackintosh. Therefore, the building, however elegant its interiors, is really

just a modern architect’s interpretation of what Mackintosh had in mind.
The tour includes the main hall, the dining room, with its gesso panels,
and the music room. Mackintosh devotees flock here, but to me it is not
the same as the real thing. On the plus side, however, there is the popular
Art Lover’s Cafe as well as a gift shop, all surrounded by a parkland set-
ting adjacent to Victorian walled gardens.

Hunterian Museum
Hillhead/West End
First opened in 1807, this is Glasgow’s oldest museum. It’s named after
William Hunter, its early benefactor, who donated his private collections in
1783. The original home was a handsome Greek revival building near the
High Street across town on the Old College campus, none of which sur-
vives today. Now housed in the main Glasgow University buildings, the col-
lection is wide-ranging: from dinosaur fossils to coins to relics of the
Roman occupation and plunder by the Vikings. The story of Captain Cook’s
voyages is pieced together in ethnographic material from the South Seas.

The Lighthouse
Commercial Centre
The Lighthouse (Scotland’s Centre for Architecture, Design, and the City)
opened in 1999, a year when the city hosted an international celebration
of its architecture. It is housed in Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s first public
commission, home of the Glasgow Herald newspaper from 1895.
Unoccupied for 15 years, the building is now a seven-story, state-of-the-art
exhibition space devoted to architecture and design. The Mackintosh
Interpretation Centre on the third level is the Lighthouse’s only permanent
exhibition, which provides an overview of Mackintosh’s art, design, and
architecture. Visitors can ride an elevator to a viewing platform that offers
a unique panorama of the city. The facility includes a cafe: the Doocot.

of the original Glasgow Underground stations. The superb and varied ship
models in the Clyde Room reflect the significance of Glasgow and the River

ing. By 2008, the museum should be in a new flashy building on the city’s

Pollok Country Park
Southside
On the Southside, this large, hilly expanse of open space is the home to
both the Burrell Collection and Pollok House but merits a visit for its own
attributes. Rhododendrons, Japanese maples, and azaleas are part of the
formal plantings created at the end of the 19th century by Sir John Stirling
Maxwell, whose family were longtime residents of Pollok House. However,
the park is best for its glens and pastures, which lend themselves to graz-
ing Highland cattle.

Provand’s Lordship
Townhead
Glasgow’s oldest house, built in the 1470s, and the only survivor from what
would have been clusters of medieval homes and buildings in this area of
the city near Glasgow Cathedral. It is named after a church canon who
once resided here. Thanks to the 17th century furniture from the original
collection of Sir William Burrell, it shows what the interiors would have
been like around the date 1700.

St. Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art
Townhead
Opened in 1993, this eclectic museum of spirituality is next to Glasgow
Cathedral on the site where the Bishop’s Castle once stood. It embraces a
collection that spans the centuries and highlights various religious groups.
It has been hailed as rather unique in that Buddha, Ganesha, and Shiva,
amongst other spiritual leaders, saints, and historic figures are treated
equally. The grounds include a Zen garden of stone and gravel.

Scotland Street School Museum
Southside
Another of Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s designs, this building, commis-
sioned by the local school board near the beginning of the 20th century, cel-
ebrated its centenary in 2005. Given that it is surrounded by light-industrial
parks and faces the M8 motorway, it seems an odd location for a school. But
that’s only because all of the surrounding apartment buildings were torn
down, which is why the school had only about 90 pupils when it shut down
in 1979. The museum that occupies this admittedly lesser work from the
great architect is devoted to the history of education in Scotland, with recon-
structed examples of classrooms from the Victorian, World War II, and 1960s
eras. It also has displays of Mackintosh’s design for the building.

The Tall Ship at Glasgow Harbour
West End
Here you have a chance to board one of the last remaining Clydebuilt sail-
ing ships, the SV Glenlee. Built in 1896, she circumnavigated Cape Horn 15
times. Restored in 1999, the vessel is one of only five sailing ships built on
the River Clyde that remain afloat. You can explore the ship and take in an
exhibition detailing Glenlee’s cargo-trading history while you’re onboard.
If maritime topics float your boat, also consider visiting the Clydebuilt
Scottish Maritime Museum (% 0141-886-1013) in the Braehead Shopping
Centre.

Guided tours
The City Sightseeing Glasgow tours circle the town in brightly colored
and open-topped buses. They operate from April through October,
departing from George Square about every 15 to 20 minutes between
9:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. You can hop on and off at some 22 designated stops
such as Glasgow Green, Glasgow University, or the Royal Concert Hall.
Passes are good for two consecutive days. The live commentary can be
quite entertaining and informative, too. For more information, contact
the office at 153 Queen St. at George Square (% 0141-204-0444; www.
scotguide.com.). Tickets are £9 ($17) adult, £3 ($5.55) children, £20
($37) family.

232

If you prefer to keep your feet on the ground and your focus is on the
more ghoulish aspects of Glasgow, the guides from Mercat Glasgow
walking tours are happy to oblige. In season (Easter–Oct), they depart
every evening from the Tourist Information Centre at George Square at
about 7:30 p.m. Guides re-create macabre Glasgow — a parade of goons
including hangmen, ghosts, murderers, and body snatchers. The tours
take about 11⁄2 hours. The company also does Historic Glasgow tours 
on request. For information, contact Mercat at 25 Forth Rd., Bearsden
(% 0141-586-5378; www.mercat-glasgow.co.uk). Tickets are £7 ($13).
Waverley Excursions (% 0141-221-8152 or 0845-130-4647; www.
waverleyexcursions.co.uk). The Waverley, considered the world’s
last “seagoing” paddle steamship, was built on the Clyde in 1947. During
the summer and depending on weather conditions, it continues to ply
the river. One-day trips beginning at the Glasgow Science Centre take
passengers “doon the watter” to historic and scenic places along the
Firth of Clyde, sometimes going as far as the Isle of Arran. As you sail
along, you can take in what were once vast shipyards turning out more
than half the earth’s tonnage of oceangoing liners. Boat tours cost £8.95
to £30 ($17–$56).
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
If you feel a bit overwhelmed by all the options of things to do and see in
Glasgow, you’re not alone. I’ve laid out a few itineraries in this section to
help you focus on your interests and use your time most efficiently,
while giving you a good sampling of what Glasgow has to offer.
Remember, these are just my ideas — feel free to tailor these itineraries
to suit your own schedule and taste.
If you have one day
From George Square (the city’s main plaza in front of Glasgow City
Chambers and the Queen Street station), catch one of the open-topped
Glasgow tour buses. Depending on your guide, the trip can be as enter-
taining as it is informative. The buses circumnavigate the city from 
Chapter 12: Glasgow 233
The “Old Firm”
Glasgow has Scotland’s two largest professional soccer teams — Celtic and 
Rangers — and they are collectively called the “Old Firm.” These clubs are among
the biggest in Europe, and both have passionate if not to say fanatical followers. Alas,
given the clubs’ histories, fans are also drawn into sectarian (religious/political) dis-
putes that have little to do with modern politics or religion but can become violent. The
best bet for visitors is to politely avoid discussions regarding the Old Firm, unless
extremely well versed. A safe bet if pressed is to say you prefer Partick, Glasgow’s
small West End club with no sectarian ties.

historic Glasgow Cathedral and the sprawling riverside park, Glasgow
Green, in the east to Glasgow University and trendy Byres Road in the
West. These open tour buses are the best way for visitors to get oriented
and understand the city’s layout and topography. Tickets are valid for 
24 hours, and you can get off and on as much as you desire. Visit at least
one of the city-run museums (remember, they’re free) and a bona-fide
Glasgow pub, such as the Horse Shoe.
If you have two days
Spend your first day as I suggest in the one-day itinerary earlier. Then,
try to take in a bit of real Charles Rennie Mackintosh architecture by
way of an organized tour of the Art School on Garnethill or an unguided
visit to the interiors of his family house reconstructed at Glasgow
University’s Hunterian Art Gallery. Spend more time in the West End
and check out the recently renovated Kelvingrove Art Gallery and
Museum. Or go south and visit the vaunted Burrell Collection. Its art
and artifacts from ancient to modern are the pride of the city, housed in
an attractive, contemporary building amid verdant Pollok Country Park. 
If you have three days
Follow my one- and two-day itineraries earlier, and on your third day,
architecture buffs should discover more about Alexander “Greek”
Thomson, who preceded Mackintosh by two generations and was
equally innovative and important. Try Holmwood House on the city’s
Southside. After London, Glasgow is the second best city for shopping in
the entire U.K. But don’t be content with the familiar department stores
(House of Fraser or John Lewis); seek out the designer labels in
Merchant City’s Italian Centre or some funky shops off Byres Road in
the West End. Don’t miss a visit to the Cathedral, and if the weather’s
fine, hike around the nearby Central Necropolis. The city’s main grave-
yard occupies a hill, so the views are grand, and the area has also
become home to a family of deer.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
234
A festival all its own
There’s no doubt that if history could be rewritten, Glasgow would love to be the host
of the annual International Festival instead of Edinburgh. However, the city to the west
is not bereft of its own annual happenings. Celtic Connections is the best attended
annual festival in Glasgow and the largest of its kind (a folk festival plus more than that
description implies) in the world. It kicks off the year every January. The main venue
for performances is the Royal Concert Hall, which produces the event. Guests include
folk musicians, dancers, and contemporary artists. For more information, contact 
% 0141-353-8000 or visit www.grch.com.

If you (are lucky and) have four days or more
Having followed my earlier recommendations, on Day 4 those interested
in social history may want to visit the People’s Palace museum in
Glasgow Green, while visitors attuned to contemporary arts have not
only the CCA but also the Arches and Tramway to consider. On the
weekends, lovers of flea markets owe the Barras stalls a visit. You can
also take an excursion down the Clyde toward the sea or up the road to
Loch Lomond and the beginnings of the Highlands. In most directions, it
takes a drive of only about 15 to 25 minutes to find open countryside
outside of Glasgow.
Walking tour: The West End
Because Glasgow is set on fairly gentle hills rising up from a basin cre-
ated by the River Clyde, the city is amenable to walking. Most “perambu-
lations” don’t involve the scaling of many steep streets, although in order
to obtain good vistas, a climb is sometimes obligatory. This stroll takes
about two hours (without going inside any buildings) and gives you a
sense of Glasgow’s salubrious and trendy West End, while hitting some of
its landmarks as well. The stroll begins in Charing Cross on Sauchiehall
Street, but on the western side of the M8 motorway, which is set in a con-
crete canyon.
Begin at:
1. Cameron Fountain
From the rusty red stone fountain, built in 1896 and listing consid-
erably eastward, one can stroll a few blocks south on North Street,
which runs parallel to the freeway, to see the Mitchell Library, the
largest public reference library in Europe. At the back of the build-
ing is the Mitchell Theatre, inscribed with the names of Raphael,
Watt, Michelangelo, Newton, and more.
From the fountain, walk up Woodside Crescent (often abbreviated
as “Cres”) to:
2. Woodside Terrace
This late Georgian row of homes (designed by George Smith in the
1830s) began an exemplary New Town development. Here you find
Greek Doric porticos unlike any in the city. But most of the credit for
the overall elegance and charm of Woodlands Hill goes to Charles
Wilson, whose designs in the middle of the 19th century are mostly
responsible for the terraces up the hillside to Park Circus.
Continue on Woodside Terrace, turning right (north) on Lynedoch
Terrace to Lynedoch Street, and proceed left to:
3. Trinity College and Park Church Tower
The former Trinity College (now Trinity House) is a landmark
whose three towers are visible from many approaches to the city.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 235

Designed by Charles Wilson, it was constructed in 1857 as the Free
Church College. Apparently most of the original interiors were lost
when the complex was converted to condos in the 1980s. Across
the broad triangular intersection is the cream-colored Park Church
Tower. Part of JT Rochead’s 1856 design, it is the other feature of
the neighborhood that is recognizable from some distance. Alas,
the church that went with the tower was razed in the late 1960s.
Only a steeple remains.
From here, go left (south) and follow the gentle curve (west) of
Woodlands Terrace, turning right (north) at Park Street South to:
4. Park Circus
This oval of handsome and uniform three-story buildings around a
small central garden is the heart of Wilson’s plans, designed in 1855.
No. 22 (now the registration office and site of civil ceremonies) offers
the most remarkable interiors, with Corinthian columns and an Art
Nouveau billiard room. Attendants are not impressed when unin-
vited visitors just wander in, however. Luckily, the external door is
impressive enough. At the western end of Park Circus is Park Gate,
which leads to an entrance to Kelvingrove Park. This promontory
offers excellent views towards the University and south to the Clyde.
Enter:
5. Kelvingrove Park
Originally West End Park, the development of this hilly and lush
open space on the banks of the River Kelvin was commissioned to
Sir Joseph Paxton in 1854, although construction apparently began
a year before he produced his plans. At this elevated entrance is
the statue of Lord Roberts on his steed. Down the hill to the left,
the Gothic Stewart Memorial Fountain includes signs of the zodiac
and scenes that depict the source of the city’s main supply of
water: Loch Katrine. Crossing the river below Park Gate at the
Highland Light Infantry Memorial is the faded red sandstone Prince
of Wales Bridge. Across the bridge looking back at you is the head
of Thomas Carlyle emerging from the roughly hewn stone.
When facing the bridge at the infantry memorial, go right (north)
and follow one of the two paths that run along the river and exit the
park at:
6. Gibson Street
Leaving the park, turn left (west) and cross the short road bridge
that brings you into the Hillhead district, which includes the main
campus of the University of Glasgow on Gilmorehill and the
Western Infirmary. Gibson Street today offers several eating and
drinking options. If you’re hungry, stop now.
Continue west on Gibson Street to Bank Street, go right (north) 1
block to Great George Street, then left (west) 1 block to Oakfield
Avenue and:
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
236

7. Eton Terrace
Here, on the corner across from Hillhead High School, the unmistak-
able work of architect Alexander Thomson is evident in an impres-
sive (if today poorly kept) terrace of eight houses completed in 1864
(following his similarly designed Moray Place). Two temple-like
facades serve as bookends, both pushing slightly forward and rising
one floor higher than the rest, and have double porches apparently
fashioned after the Choragic Monument of Thrassylus in Athens.
Ironically, for all his admiration of Eastern design, Thomson never
traveled outside the U.K.
Return to the corner of Great George Street and follow Oakfield
Avenue south, crossing Gibson Street to University Avenue; then
turn right (west) up the hill to the:
8. University of Glasgow
Aficionados rightfully bemoan the loss of the original campus east
of the High Street, which may have offered the best examples of
17th-century architecture in Scotland. The university moved to its
current location in the 1860s, and the city could have done worse —
a lot worse. The setting high above Kelvingrove Park is befitting of a
center of learning. Englishman Sir George Gilbert Scott controver-
sially won the design commission and his Gothic Revival is punctu-
ated by a tower that rises from the double quadrangle — a virtual
beacon on the horizon of the West End. Fragments of the original
university can be seen, too, in the facade of Pearce Lodge as well as
the salvaged Lion and Unicorn Stair at the chapel.
Cross University Avenue north to Hillhead Street and the:
9. Hunterian Art Gallery
Built in the 1980s next to the university library, this gallery houses
the school’s permanent collection, which includes 18th- and 19th-
century Scottish art as well as many works by James McNeill
Whistler. Scots-Italian contemporary artist Eduardo Paolozzi
designed the chunky cast aluminum internal doors to the main
exhibition space.
Incorporated into the building (past the gift shop) is:
10. Mackintosh House
Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s and wife Margaret Macdonald’s West
End home (originally nearby and demolished by the university in
the 1960s) is replicated here with furniture and interiors designed
by the pair. Visitors enter from the side (the front door is actually
several feet above the level of the plaza outside), and see the dining
room, sitting room with study, and the couple’s bedroom. At the
top is a replication of a bedroom Mackintosh designed for a house
in England, his final commission.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 237

Return to University Avenue, exit Mackintosh House turning 
right to:
11. University Gardens
This street features a fine row of houses designed primarily by 
J.J. Burnet in the 1880s, but it’s worth a stop especially to admire
no. 12, done by J. Gaff Gillespie in 1900; that house exemplifies
Glasgow style and the influences of Mackintosh and Art Nouveau.
Continue down University Gardens past Queen Margaret Union and
other university buildings, going left down the stairs just past the
Gregory Building. At the bottom of the stairs, follow the sidewalk
and turn right onto:
12. Ashton Lane
This cobbled mews is the heart of West End nightlife, although it
bustles right through the day, too, with a mix of University stu-
dents, instructors, and staff, as well as local residents. The host of
bars, cafes, and restaurants here includes the venerable Ubiquitous
Chip, which can be credited for starting (in 1971) the ongoing ren-
aissance of excellent cooking of fresh Scottish produce.
Go left past Ubiquitous Chip down the narrow lane to Byres Road.
Just to the right, you can catch the underground (Hillhead station)
back to the city center (Buchanan Street station). Or turn right on:
13. Byres Road
Ashton Lane’s primary entrance is midway along the proverbial
Main Street of this part of Glasgow: Byres Road, which is full of
bars, cafes, restaurants, and shops. Rarely less than buzzing, the
road exemplifies the West End for many people. If you aren’t in a
hurry, the streets running west from Byres Road, such as Athole or
Huntly Gardens, merit a brief wander to see the proud townhouses.
Proceed north up Byres Road to:
14. Great Western Road
It took an act of Parliament in London in 1836 to create this street,
and then a new turnpike road into the city. Today, its four lanes
remain one of the main thoroughfares into and out of Glasgow. A
stroll west for 5 or 6 blocks from this intersection (Byres and Great
Western roads) reveals the opulent terraces (including one by
Thomson) along Great Western’s southern flank. Going in the oppo-
site direction takes you to more retail and commercial shops.
Cross Great Western Road to the:
15. Botanic Gardens
Neither as extensive nor as grand as the Royal Botanic Gardens
in Edinburgh, this hilly park is pleasant nonetheless. One main
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
238

attraction, Kibble Palace, is a giant domed cast iron and glass
Victorian conservatory with exotic plants. Other greenhouses
house orchid collections, while the outdoor planting includes a
working vegetable plot, roses and rhododendrons, and beds with
lots of flowering perennials.
Shopping in Glasgow
After London, the capital of Great Britain and a city at least ten times its
size, Glasgow apparently has the second most retail space in all of the
U.K. It is a shopping Mecca for everyone in the west of the country and
apparently a reason for people to visit from northern England, too, as it
is not as far away as the shops of London’s Soho. 
Among the few retail goods that are high quality and priced competi-
tively are fine wool knits, particularly cashmere sweaters — or as the
Scots prefer, “jumpers” — and scarves. Anything produced within the
country (with the exception of whisky, which is taxed as heavily as 
all alcoholic products) should be less expensive than at home: from
smoked salmon and shortbread to Caithness glass, used in those
beguiling paper weights with swirling, colorful designs. Finally, given the
number of artists in the country, getting an original piece of art to bring
home might represent the most value for money.
For visitors from abroad, prices in the U.K. aren’t a major selling point.
In recent years, the British currency (the pound sterling) has been trad-
ing strongly against other major currencies, such as the U.S. dollar and
the euro (which most of Britain’s partners in the European Union now
use). The good news is that prices for most products in Scotland have
been stable since the mid-1990s, and in some cases (for example,
clothes) prices have come down in real terms. Nevertheless, many items
carry the same numerical price in pounds as they would in American
dollars. For example, a digital camera that costs $300 in New York may
well be priced £300 ($555) in Glasgow, making it 50 percent to 100 per-
cent more expensive.
Best shopping areas
The main area for retail therapy is defined by the pedestrian malls of
Argyle Street, Buchanan Street, and Sauchiehall Street, which join
together and form a Z shape right in the heart of the city. But for more
unique shops and fashions, it pays to venture to the Merchant City and
the West End. And perhaps the city’s most unique shopping experience
is at the flea market–like stalls at the weekend Barras market, in the East
End of Glasgow.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 239

In general, shops in the city are open Monday to Wednesday, Friday, and
Saturday from 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. And be warned, they tend to
close sharply, regardless of the number of potential shoppers still out on
the sidewalks. But in 2006, the city was considering later opening hours
for city center stores in order to compete with the shopping develop-
ments on Glasgow’s periphery, which are open daily until 8 p.m. Only on
Thursday do the shops “in town” stay open late —until 8 p.m., at least.
Most established stores are now open in the afternoon on Sunday, too.
Shopping complexes
Of course, any shopping city worth its salt these days must offer indoor
malls. In Glasgow, Princes Square (Buchanan Street; % 0141-204-1685;
www.princessquare.co.uk) is the city’s most stylish and up-market
shopping center. Housed in a modernized and renovated Victorian build-
ing, the mall has many specialty stores, men’s and women’s fashion out-
lets, and restaurants, cafes, and bars.
Nearby, between Argyle Street and the River Clyde is the St. Enoch
Shopping Centre (% 0141-204-3900), whose merchandise is less expen-
sive and a lot less posh than what you find at Princes Square. St. Enoch’s
resembles a fairly conventional mall, with a couple of major department
stores and a food court at one end.
If you’re after a fancy watch or gold ring, go to the Argyll Arcade, the
main entrance to which is at 30 Buchanan St. Even if the year of its con-
struction (1827) weren’t posted above the entrance, you’d still know
that this collection of shops beneath a curved glass ceiling is historic.
The L-shaped arcade contains one of the largest concentrations of retail
jewelers, both antique and modern, in all of Europe. Purchasing a wed-
ding band here is considered lucky.
The latest contribution to mall shopping in the city center is the
Buchanan Galleries (% 0141-333-9898; www.buchanangalleries.
co.uk), found at the top of Buchanan Street. Completed in 1999, this 
mammoth development is hardly groundbreaking, but it does include 
the rightfully respected John Lewis department store.
On the western outskirts of town, the Braehead Shopping Centre
(% 0141-885-1441; www.braehead.co.uk) opened most recently and
somewhat controversially because it appears to be taking people away
from the city center. Braehead’s major draw is a sprawling Ikea store.
What to look for and where to find it
If your shopping intentions are less of the browsing variety, here are
some of Glasgow’s specialized shopping options. Unless otherwise indi-
cated, the shops below are in the Commercial Centre of Glasgow and are
within walking distance of the Buchanan Street or St. Enoch under-
ground stations.

Antiques
 Victorian Village offers a warren of shops and a pleasantly claus-
trophobic clutter of goods. Much of the merchandise isn’t particu-
larly noteworthy, but you can find some worthwhile pieces if you
know what you’re after and are willing to go hunting. 93 W. Regent
St. (% 0141-332-0808).
Art
 Compass Gallery was opened by Cyril Gerber (see next bullet) to
offer affordable pieces of contemporary art by local artists. You 
can find something special for as little as £20 ($37) here, depending
on the show. The pre-Christmas sale is particularly good. 178 W.
Regent St. (% 0141-221-6370; www.compassgallery.co.uk).
 Cyril Gerber Fine Art is one of Glasgow’s best small galleries and
shops. It veers away from the avant-garde, specializing in British
painting of the 19th and 20th centuries. It has good Scottish land-
scapes and cityscapes, especially works by Colourists and the
Glasgow Boys. Gerber has been the city’s most respected art
authority for several decades, with lots of contacts in art circles
throughout Britain. 148 W. Regent St. (% 0141-221-3095; www.
cyrilgerberfineart.com).
 Glasgow Print Studio includes a shop that sells limited edition
etchings, wood blocks, aquatints, and screen prints by members 
of the prestigious collective as well as other notable artists. Prices
are good, and there’s a framing facility on the premises. 25 King St.
(% 0141-552-0704; www.gpsart.co.uk).
Books
 Borders offers a multistory shop at the back of Royal Exchange
Square. You find a gratifying emphasis on the culture of Scotland
and plenty of places to sit and read. Borders also has the best
selection of international periodicals in Scotland. 98 Buchanan St.
(% 0141-222-7700; www.borders.com).
 Caledonia Books is one of the few remaining secondhand and anti-
quarian shops in the city of Glasgow. Charming and well run, the
stock here tends to favor quality over quantity. 483 Great Western
Rd., West End (% 0141-334-9663; www.caledoniabooks.co.uk).
 Waterstones is a giant Barnes-and-Noble–like operation with plenty
of stock, a cafe, and a lot of soft seats. The ground floor features a
good Scottish section. 174 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-248-4814; www.
waterstones.co.uk).
Clothes
 Cruise has the best selection of designer togs in town — better
bring your credit cards! Labels include Prada, Armani, D&G,
Vivienne Westwood, and more. At the second branch nearby 
Chapter 12: Glasgow 241

(223 Ingram St.), the Oki-Ni shop within the shop offers limited 
edition Adidas and Levis. 180 Ingram St., Merchant City (% 0141-
572-3232).
 Dr. Jives began as a vintage clothing shop for men in the late 1980s
but has evolved into the hippest boutique in town for cutting-edge
designer looks, especially for the skater crowds at the dance clubs.
111 Candleriggs, Merchant City (% 0141-552-4551).
 Jigsaw was recently relocated under the glorious dome of the
Baroque-style former Savings Bank of Glasgow. This is the fashion-
able U.K. chain of clothes and accessories for women and juniors.
Using its own design team in Kew, West London, Jigsaw opened its
first shop in Hampstead some 30 years ago. 177 Ingram St., at
Glassford Street (% 0141-552-7639).
 Starry Starry Night shows just how tiny those Victorians and
Edwardians were — although they wore some pretty stunning
gowns. This shop (with a branch in the Barras market) normally
has a few items worth dusting off. It also stocks secondhand kilts
and matching attire. 19 Dowanside Lane, West End; Underground:
Hillhead (% 0141-337-1837). 
 Thomas Pink is perhaps the closest thing to that temple of preppy
sensibilities: Brooks Brothers. This is the place for the finest
button-down Oxford shirts that a man could possibly hope for —
and a silk tie to match. 1 Royal Bank (% 0141-248-9661).
Department stores
 Debenhams is a sturdy department store with midrange prices. 
St. Enoch Shopping Centre, 97 Argyle St. (% 0141-221-0088).
 House of Fraser is Glasgow’s version of Harrods. A Victorian-era
glass arcade rises up four stories, and on the various levels you
find everything from clothing to Oriental rugs, from crystal to hand-
made local artifacts of all kinds. 21–45 Buchanan St., at Argyle
Street (% 0141-221-3880; www.houseoffraser.co.uk).
 John Lewis is a close equivalent to Macy’s, with quality brand
names, assured service, and a no-questions-asked return policy 
on damaged or faulty goods. Buchanan Galleries, 220 Buchanan St.
(% 0141-353-6677).
 Marks & Spencer has had its share of problems with shareholders
and in board rooms, as anyone who reads international finance
pages will know. But the chain carries on with clothing and very
good food halls. The two branches in Glasgow are on Argyle and
Sauchiehall streets. 2–12 Argyle St. (% 0141-552-4546); 172
Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-332-6097).

Edibles
See the sidebar “Picnic fare,” earlier in this chapter, for a list of select
food markets with Scottish specialties.
Gifts and design
 Catherine Shaw is named after the long-deceased matriarch of the
family that runs the place today. It’s a somewhat cramped gift shop
that has cups, mugs, postcards, jewelry, and souvenirs — a good
place for easy-to-pack gifts. 24 Gordon St. (% 0141-204-4762). 
Look for another branch at 31 Argyll Arcade (% 0141-221-9038);
entrances to the arcade are on both Argyll and Buchanan streets.
 Felix & Oscar is a wacky and fun shop for offbeat cards and toys,
kitsch accessories, fuzzy bags, perfumes and toiletries, and a selec-
tion of T-shirts that you’re not likely to find anywhere else in
Glasgow. (In addition to the flagship, there is another on Cresswell
Lane.) 459 Great Western Rd., West End; Underground: Kelvin
Bridge (% 0131-339-8585).
 Mackintosh Shop is a small gift shop in the Glasgow School of Art
that prides itself on a stock of books, cards, stationery, mugs, glass-
ware, and sterling-and-enamel jewelry created from or inspired by
the original designs of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Glasgow School
of Art, 167 Renfrew St. (% 0141-353-4500).
 National Trust for Scotland Shop offers “Glasgow-style” contem-
porary arts and crafts, pottery, furniture, and jewelry designed
exclusively by local artists. Hutcheson Hall, 158 Ingram St. 
(% 0141-552-8391).
Kilts and tartan
 Geoffrey (Tailor) Kiltmakers and Weavers is both a retailer and a
manufacturer of tartans, which means they have all the clans and
have also created their own range of 21st-century-style kilts — 
for better or worse. 309 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-331-2388; www.
geoffreykilts.co.uk).
 Hector Russell was founded in 1881 and remains Scotland’s long-
established kiltmaker. Crystal and gift items are sold on street level,
but the real heart and soul of the place is below, where impeccably
crafted and reasonably priced tweed jackets, tartan-patterned
accessories, waistcoats, and sweaters of top-quality wool for men
and women are displayed. 110 Buchanan St. (% 0141-221-0217).
 James Pringle Weavers has been in business since 1780. This shop
is known for its traditional clothing that includes well-crafted, bulky
wool sweaters and a tasteful selection of ties, kilts, and tartans.
Some of the merchandise is unique to this shop. Ever slept in a
tartan nightshirt? 130 Buchanan St. (% 0141-221-3434).
Chapter 12: Glasgow 243

Music
 Avalanche is the indie music CD store to beat all others. It’s small
and cramped (near Queen Street Station) but is the best for the
latest releases by everybody from the White Stripes to local stars
Belle & Sebastian and up-and-comers. 34 Dundas St. (% 0141-
332-2099).
 Fopp is Glasgow’s largest independent outlet. It offers one of the
best selections of CDs, ranging from classics to hottest hits and
including music books and vinyl, too. Fopp also stocks a good
number of re-releases priced at only £5 ($9.25). 358 Byres Rd., West
End (% 0141-357-0774). In addition to the West End flagship, a
larger, multistory branch is in the city center on Union Street 
(% 0141-222-2128).
 Monorail is located within the vegan restaurant and bar called Mono.
This is the most individual of independent CD and record outlets in
the city. Glasgow is alight with young musicians, and this shop spe-
cializes in new music from emerging local acts, as well as the best of
cutting edge bands from elsewhere. 10 King St. (% 0141-553-2400).
Living It Up After Dark
Today, some say that Glasgow — and not Edinburgh — is the center of
contemporary culture in Scotland. It’s an arguable, not to say locally con-
troversial, point of view, however. There’s no doubt that Glasgow has
seen the most progress since the middle of the 20th century, when the
shipping and industrial boom began to go bust, creating an image of pro-
found decline. It was reversed throughout the 1980s. Despite any periods
of decline, however, Glasgow’s local arts scene was always alive.
But ultimately, the truth is this: Both cities contribute mightily — and
equally — to the cultural vibrancy of the nation. Their strength as a pair
of lively cities is considerably more significant than debating which has
the most to offer individually. With this idea in mind, the country would
do well to improve the public transportation links between the two
cities, especially in the wee small hours. Nightlife in both Edinburgh and
Glasgow would benefit if officials made it easier to move between the
two city centers after dark.
Although the Scottish capital to the east is home to the country’s
national art galleries and museums, Glasgow is where the national opera
and ballet companies as well as the Scottish National Orchestra are
based. It’s also the city where young talent is nurtured at the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Additionally, Glasgow is home
to several theaters, including two that rank highly across the U.K. for
staging groundbreaking drama: the Citizens and the Tron. Even more
experimental performance can be seen at the Arches and Tramway.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
244

The performing arts
Although hardly competition for a drama giant like London, Glasgow’s
theater scene is the equal of Edinburgh’s. Young Scottish playwrights
often make their debuts here, and among the classics, you’re likely to
see anything from Beckett’s Waiting for Godot to The Marriage of Figaro.
 The Arches is located within the vaulted brick arches beneath 
the railway lines in and out of Central Station. The venue, which
marked its 15th year in 2006, offers a range of inexpensive drama
and performances — which includes edgy new plays as well as
Shakespeare — by its own unit as well as visiting companies. But
the Arches also has space for a fairly full schedule of live music of
all description, regular dance clubs, and visual art exhibits. The
cafe/bar at the Arches is, like at the Traverse in Edinburgh, a scene
unto itself. Tickets are £4–£10 ($7.40–$19). 253 Argyle St. (% 0141-
565-1023; www.thearches.co.uk; Underground: St. Enoch).
 Citizens Theatre is perhaps the prime symbol of Glasgow’s verve
and democratic approach to theater. Located in Gorbals, just across
the River Clyde from the Commercial Centre area of Glasgow, the
“Citz” is home to a repertory company and has three performance
spaces: a main auditorium and two smaller theaters. In 2004, new
artistic director Jeremy Raison made his debut. Prices are always
reasonable. Tickets are £5 to £15 ($9.25–$28). 119 Gorbals St. 
(% 0141-429-0022; www.citz.co.uk; Bus: 5, 12, 20, or 66).
 Glasgow Royal Concert Hall is the home of the Royal Scottish
National Orchestra, which plays its yearly winter/spring series and
pops seasons in the main auditorium. Very little is subtle about this
modern music hall, which is the most prestigious performance space
in the city for everything from touring ballet companies to pop/rock
acts such as Elvis Costello or Jackson Browne. The hall also pro-
duces the city’s annual Celtic Connections festival every January.
Tickets are £10 to £35 ($19–$65). 2 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-353-8000;
www.grch.com; Underground: Buchanan St.).
 The King’s Theatre celebrated its 100th birthday in 2004. This mag-
nificent, red-sandstone hall is the place where famous touring
Broadway and West End spectacles, such as Miss Saigon, are likely
to appear — as well as locally produced popular and light entertain-
ment, whether comedies, musicals, or family-oriented plays. During
December and January, the King’s is best noted for its over-the-top
pantomime presentations, often starring well-known Scottish actors.
Tickets are £6 to £26 ($11–$48). 297 Bath St. (% 0141-240-111; www.
theambassadors.com/kings; Suburban train: Charing Cross; Bus:
16 or 18).
 Pavilion Theatre is, compared to the King’s Theatre, an equally his-
toric if less architecturally distinguished venue. It specializes in
family entertainment, variety shows, light drama, tribute acts, and
bands, as well as comedy and occasional modern versions of
Chapter 12: Glasgow 245

vaudeville (which, as they assure you around here, is still alive).
The Pavilion is a prime location for pantomime around Christmas
time. Tickets are £10 to £25 ($19–$46). 121 Renfield St. (% 0141-
332-1846; www.paviliontheatre.co.uk; Underground: Buchanan
St.; Bus: 21, 23, or 38).
 Theatre Royal is the home of the ambitious, well respected, but
also financially beleaguered Scottish Opera, as well as the increas-
ingly acclaimed Scottish Ballet. Called somewhat exaggeratedly by
the Daily Telegraph “the most beautiful opera theatre in the king-
dom,” the hall also hosts visiting companies from around the
world. Tickets range from £3.50 (standby) to £55 ($6.50–$102). 254
Hope St. (% 0141-332-9000; www.theatreroyalglasgow.com;
Underground: Cowcaddens; Bus: 20, 40, or 41).
 Tramway is a post-industrial, huge hangar of an arts venue and one
of the only places in Glasgow able to stage sprawling performance
art and modern theater, such as Peter Brook’s The Mahabharata,
which came here in the late 1980s. In 2004, however, the city, which
owns Tramway, was controversially considering the option of rent-
ing it to the national ballet company as rehearsal space. In addition
to drama, the former repair shop for the city’s trams houses art
exhibits. Tickets range from £4 to £12 ($7.40–$22). 25 Albert Dr.,
Pollokshields, Southside (% 0141-330-3050; www.tramway.org;
Bus: 38 or 45; Suburban train: Pollokshields East).
 Tron Theatre is housed in a part of the former Tron Church, which
dates back to the 15th century. The venue offers one of Scotland’s
leading stages for new and sometimes experimental dramatic per-
formances. The stage is often the place where contemporary local
companies, such as Cryptic or Vanishing Point, debut works. In
addition to theater, the hall is used for music and dance. The 
Tron also has a modern bar/cafe as well as a beautifully restored
Victorian bar/restaurant serving lunch and dinner, including vege-
tarian dishes, as well as a fine selection of beer and wine. Tickets
are £3 to £20 ($5.55–$37). 63 Trongate (% 0141-552-4267; www.
tron.co.uk; Underground: St. Enoch).
For a complete rundown of what’s happening in the city, pick up a copy
of The List, a biweekly magazine available at all major newsstands and
book shops. The List reviews, previews, and gives the details of arts and
events in Glasgow and Edinburgh. 
Comedy
 Jongleurs Comedy Club is a corporate-owned entity from down
south, with more than a dozen venues across the U.K. The cover
charge is £12 ($22). UGC Building, Renfield and Renfrew streets 
(% 0870-787-0707; Underground: Buchanan St.).
 The Stand opened a second venue in Glasgow after starting and
thriving in Edinburgh. Its presence has helped to establish an
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
246

annual International Comedy Festival every spring in the city.
Usually, Tuesday night, called “Red Raw,” is reserved for amateurs.
The cover charge is £2 to £8 ($3.70–$15). 333 Woodlands Rd. 
(% 0870-600-6055; www.thestand.co.uk; Underground:
Kelvinbridge).
Dance clubs
 Bamboo is a stylish basement club with three distinct rooms, one
of which is a rather posh cocktail lounge. One room, the Disco
Badger club of house and R&B music, gets good notices. Bamboo’s
open daily from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. The cover charge is £5 to £8
($9.25–$15). 51 West Regent St. (% 0141-332-1067; Underground:
Buchanan St.).
 Fury Murry’s draws a mostly younger crowd that’s looking for
nothing more complicated than a good, sometimes rowdy, time 
listening to upbeat disco. It’s a short walk from the St. Enoch
Shopping Centre and is open Thursday through Sunday from 
10:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. The cover charge is £2 to £6 ($3.70–$11). 
96 Maxwell St. (% 0141-221-6511; Underground: St. Enoch).
Folk music
 Oran Mor opened in the summer of 2004 as an ambitious center for
the performing arts, and includes bars and restaurants as well as
different spaces for live music. Byres and Great Western roads 
(% 0870-013-2652; Underground: Hillhead).
 St. Andrew’s in the Square is a sympathetically restored and con-
verted 18th-century church that is now dedicated to folk and tradi-
tional Scottish music. The program includes concerts and ceilidhs
(Scottish country dances) in the main hall upstairs. In the basement,
Café Source serves wholesome Scottish nosh and hosts regular ses-
sions of jazz and Scottish music, which may be rather reverentially
enjoyed by the patrons. Tickets are £4 to £8 ($7.40–$15). 1 St.
Andrew’s Sq. (% 0141-548-6020; www.standrewsinthesquare.com;
Underground: St. Enoch).
 Scotia Bar is one beam in a triangle of pubs that frequently offer
live music that includes, but is not solely, folk. The others pubs of
this sort are nearby: Clutha Vaults and Victoria. No cover charge is
required. 112 Stockwell St. (% 0141-552-8681).
Rock, pop, and jazz
 Barrowland has no seats and may stink of beer, but this former
ballroom is the top place in the city to see visiting bands. The hall
rocks, and groups generally rank it among the best venues in the
U.K. in which to perform. With room for about 2,000, Barrowland
Chapter 12: Glasgow 247

isn’t exactly intimate, but if you can withstand the mosh pit, you’ll
feel the sweat of the performers. 244 Gallowgate (% 0141-552-
4601; Underground: St. Enoch; Bus: 61, 62, or 24).
 Carling Academy is a 2,500-capacity ex-Bingo hall that opened as a
live music venue in 2003. It’s part of a chain that includes the leg-
endary Brixton Academy in London, and thus has a booking
strength with touring bands. Pity its corporate sponsor has to be
so prominent in the name. 121 Eglinton Rd. (% 0141-418-3000;
Underground: Bridge St.).
 Grand Ole Opry, a sprawling sandstone building 2.5km (11⁄2 miles)
south of the city center, is the largest club in Europe devoted to
country and western music. (And they love their country and west-
ern music in Glasgow!) The Opry has a bar and dancing (Texas
line–style) on two levels and a chuck-wagon eatery that serves
affordable steaks and other such fare. Performers are usually from
the U.K., but a handful of artists from the States turn up, too. The
cover charge is £3 to £10 ($5.55–$19). 2–4 Govan Rd., Paisley Toll
Road (% 0141-429-5396; Bus: 9 or 54).
 King Tut’s Wah-Wah Hut is a crowded rock bar that has been in
business for more than a decade. It’s a good place to check out the
Glasgow music and arts crowd as well as local bands and the occa-
sional international act. Successful Scottish acts such as Teenage
Fan Club got their starts here. The cover is usually about £5
($9.25). 272 St. Vincent St. (% 0141-221-5279; Bus: 9 or 62).
 Nice ’n’ Sleazy books live acts to perform in the dark, basement
space. The cover is quite reasonable, but it can get more expensive
if you catch a more established act, such as ex-head Lemonhead
Evan Dando. Holding some 200 patrons, it provides a rare opportu-
nity to catch such musicians in an intimate setting. The cover
charge is £5–£20 ($9.25–$37). 421 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-333-
9637; Bus: 18 or 44; Suburban train: Charing Cross).
 The Scottish Exhibition & Conference Centre, which incorporates
the slightly more intimate Clyde Auditorium (also called the
“Armadillo” because of its exterior design), may be somewhat
charmless, but it provides Scotland with the only indoor space
large enough to host major touring acts, from Ozzy Osbourne 
to Justin Timberlake. Finnieston Quay (% 0141-275-6211; www.
secc.co.uk).
Some top bars and pubs
Finally, you have the city’s many pubs and bars to consider. Most are
friendly places where the locals are likely to strike up a conversation
with you. A fine night out trawling the city’s many drinking holes is not
only entertaining, but it can prove to be educational as well.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
248

Pubs and bars are concentrated in the City Centre, Merchant City, and
the West End. Hours vary, but most stay open to 11 p.m. or midnight on
weeknights, and many have license to remain open until 1 a.m. on the
weekends.
 Babbity Bowster is a civilized place for a pint, with no pounding
soundtrack of mindless pop to distract you from conversation. The
wine selection is good, and the food is worth sampling as well.
Some outdoor seating (although it’s rarely in full sun) is also avail-
able. Every Saturday from about 4 p.m. on, folk musicians arrive for
spontaneous jamming. Drinks are served daily from noon to mid-
night, food until about 10 p.m. 16 Blackfriars St. (% 0141-552-5055;
Underground: Buchanan St.).
 Bar 10 is perhaps the granddaddy of the Glasgow-style bar, but
since opening it has mellowed into a comfortable place for drink-
ing. The groovy design is still apparent but more important is the
good mix of folk and the convenient City Centre location just oppo-
site the Lighthouse architecture center on tiny Mitchell Lane.
Comfort food is served from noon to about 5 p.m. Drinks are
served Monday through Saturday from noon to midnight and
Sunday from 12:30 p.m. to midnight. The place gets even livelier
when DJs spin on the weekends. 10 Mitchell Lane (% 0141-572-
1448; Underground: St. Enoch).
 Blackfriars has a decent selection of rotating beers, including 
some from the Continent, even though real ales are less plentiful in
Glasgow than in Edinburgh. Jazz is featured in Blackfriars’ basement
space on Saturdays and Sundays. Drinks are served Monday through
Saturday from noon to midnight and Sunday from 12:30 p.m. to mid-
night. 36 Bell St. (% 0141-552-5924; Underground: St. Enoch).
 Bon Accord is an amiable pub that’s the best in the city for hand-
pulled cask-conditioned real ale. The pub boasts an array of 
hand-pumps — a dozen are devoted to real English and Scottish
Chapter 12: Glasgow 249
Late night eats
Famished at four minutes past midnight? The options in Glasgow are fairly well focused
on Sauchiehall Street. Try Canton Express, 407 Sauchiehall St. (%0141-332-0145), which
looks as if it belongs on some side street in Hong Kong. You don’t get anything fancy, but
it is fast Chinese food, and the place is open daily until 4 a.m. Midway between the city
center and the West End, Insomnia Underground (Lynedoch Street and Woodlands
Road; % 0141-564-1800) does a whopping full fry-up breakfast at all hours of the day
and night through the weekend. Several Indian restaurants are open until 1 a.m., but
Spice Gardens, on the southern bank of the River Clyde (Clyde Place near Bridge Street;
% 0141-429-4422), trumps the lot by staying open until 4 a.m. every night.

ales, and the rest of the draft and bottled beers and stouts hail from
the Czech Republic, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, and Holland. The
pub is likely to satisfy your taste in malt whisky as well and offers
affordable pub food. Bon Accord is open Monday through Saturday
from noon to midnight and Sunday from noon to 11 p.m. 153 North
St. (% 0141-248-4427; Bus: 6, 8, or 16; Suburban train: Charing
Cross).
 Brel is possibly the best of the West End’s trendy Ashton Lane’s
many pubs and bars. Brel has a Belgian theme, with beers and cui-
sine favoring that country, but it’s not overplayed. The music
policy is eclectic, with DJs and live acts adding atmosphere to the
former stables. The bar is open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight.
Food is served Monday through Friday from noon to 3 p.m. and
from 5 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from noon to
10:30 p.m. 39–43 Ashton Lane (% 0141-342-4966; Underground:
Hillhead).
 Heraghty’s Free House on the city’s Southside is the real McCoy
among Glasgow’s trendy Irish-themed pubs. It serves up perfect
pints of Guinness and Irish craic (banter) in almost equal portions.
No food, though. Heraghty’s is open Monday through Thursday
from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to mid-
night, and Sunday from 12:30 to 11 p.m. 708 Pollokshaws Rd. 
(% 0141-423-0380; Bus: 38, 45, or 56).
 The Horse Shoe is the pub you should hit if you can only visit one
in Glasgow (and I’m hoping that’s not the case). It’s one of the last
remaining “Palace Pubs” that opened around the turn of the cen-
tury. The circular, island bar is one of the longest in Europe. Drinks
are inexpensive and so is the food from the upstairs buffet. Karaoke
draws crowds to the second floor lounge every night of the week,
but conversation and football on the televisions provide the enter-
tainment in the main bar. Drinks are served Monday through
Saturday from noon to midnight and Sunday from 12:30 p.m. to mid-
night. The buffet is open daily until 7:30 p.m. except on Sunday
when it closes down at 5 p.m. 17 Drury St. (% 0141-229-5711;
Underground: St. Enoch).
 Lismore Lounge in Partick is tastefully decorated in a modern
manner that still recognizes traditional Highland culture. The whisky
selection is good, and at £1.50 ($2.80) for a dram, the malt of the
month is always a bargain. The lounge features live Scottish and
Gaelic music Tuesday and Thursday nights. The bar is open Sunday
through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Friday and Saturday
from 11 a.m. to midnight. No food is served. 206 Dumbarton Rd. 
(% 0141-576-0103; Underground: Kelvinhall).
 Liquid Ship is a fairly recent addition to the West End scene.
Owned by the same people who run Stravaigin (see the listing in
the section “The top restaurants and cafes,” earlier in this chapter),
Liquid Ship is unpretentious and smart but not precisely stylish,
with the main bar up a few steps and a lounge in the basement.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
250

Drinks are served Monday through Thursday from noon to 11 p.m.,
Friday and Saturday from noon to midnight, and Sunday from 
12:30 to 11 p.m. Food, platters, and tasty sandwiches on toasted
Italian bread are served daily from noon until about 8 p.m. 171
Great Western Rd. (% 0141-331-1901; Underground: St. George’s
Cross).
 The Pot Still is the best place for sampling malt whiskies. You can
taste from a selection of hundreds and hundreds of them, in a variety
of styles (peaty or sweet), strengths, and maturities (that is, years
spent in casks). The Pot Still is open Monday through Thursday from
noon to 11 p.m., Friday and Saturday from noon to midnight, and
Sunday from 12:30 to 11 p.m. 154 Hope St. (% 0141-333-0980;
Underground: Buchanan St.).
 Vroni’s Wine Bar is for those who favor the grape over the grain,
Bordeaux to brown ale, Sancerre over cider. The feeling of this small
bar is Continental, with banquette seating and candlelit tables. It’s
open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to midnight and Sunday
from 12:30 p.m. to midnight, and food is served Monday through
Thursday from noon to 7 p.m. and until 3 p.m. on Friday. 47 W. Nile
St. (% 0141-221-4677; Underground: Buchanan St.).
Going to the movies
 Glasgow Film Theatre has two screens for a well-programmed
daily output of independent, foreign, repertory, and art-house films.
The building was originally the Cosmo, an Art Deco cinema built in
the late 1930s. Café Cosmo is good for a pre- or post-theater bever-
age. Tickets are £3 to £5 ($5.55–$9.25). 12 Rose St. (% 0141-332-
8128; www.gft.org.uk; Underground: Buchanan St.). The GFT also
schedules the films screened at the Centre for Contemporary Art
(CCA), located at 350 Sauchiehall St.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 251
Gay & lesbian Glasgow
Glasgow and its environs are said to have the largest concentration of gays and les-
bians in the U.K. outside of London. But there’s no identifiable district in the city where
the gay and lesbian community is particularly concentrated, although part of the
Merchant City has been dubbed the “gay triangle.” The Polo Lounge, 84 Wilson St.,
offers a gay but hetero-friendly club often described as a cross between an urbane
gentleman’s club and a Highland country lodge. It’s open daily from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m.
(until 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday). A £5 ($9.25) cover is charged after 10 p.m. or so.
Nearby, Revolver Bar on John Street is gay-owned and -operated. The bar has always
tried to be a bit more grown-up and to dismiss some of the more cheesy and stereo-
typical elements of the gay scene. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not fun or popular.
Conversation generally rules, but the jukebox is free. Drinks are served daily from noon
to midnight.

Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
252
American Express
The office is at 115 Hope St. (% 0141-222-
1401; Underground: St. Enoch). It’s open
Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. (except Wednesday from 9.30 a.m.)
and Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon.
Business Hours
Most offices are open Monday through
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 or 5:30 p.m. Some
companies close their doors at 4:30 p.m. 
on Fridays. Most banks are usually open
Monday through Friday from 9 or 9:30 a.m.
to 4 or 5 p.m., with some branches some-
times closing early on one day a week and
opening late on another. Opening times can
vary slightly from bank to bank. Shops are
generally open Monday through Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. On Thursdays, many
remain open until 8 p.m.
Currency Exchange
The tourist office at 11 George Sq. (% 0141-
204-4400) and the American Express office
(see listing earlier) exchange major foreign
currencies. Thomas Cook operates a cur-
rency exchange at Central Station (gener-
ally open until 6 p.m.). Many banks in the
city center operate bureaux de change, too,
and nearly all banks cash traveler’s checks

Going Beyond Edinburgh
and Glasgow: Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Discovering North Berwick and other East Lothian highlights
 Exploring Linlithgow Palace and Hopetoun House
 Seeing New Lanark’s groundbreaking workers’ village
 Visiting the quintessential Mackintosh-designed house
I
don’t think that you’ll get bored in either Edinburgh or Glasgow, but
there are some worthwhile attractions located near both cities. 
First Edinburgh: Although it has a full complement of attractions and
plenty of activities to entertain visitors, you can find some other worth-
while destinations nearby, outside the city. The closest regions are West
and East Lothian, located on either side of the city. The highlights in
these areas include the impressive ruins of Linlithgow Palace, a favorite
of the Stuart dynasty and the seaside town of North Berwick, with its
views of Bass Rock.
From Glasgow, day-trippers can easily reach Helensburgh on the Firth of
Clyde and visit one of architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s remarkable
achievements, Hill House. By going up river (that’s south, by the way)
into the Clyde Valley, day-trippers can also visit New Lanark.
In addition to the places I mention here, you can see a good deal of the
attractions in Chapters 14, 15, and 16 on day trips from Scotland’s two
major cities. So, if you’re staying in one of the cities, your options are
diverse.
East Lothian
As the largest town in the area, the royal burgh of North Berwick (the
“w” is silent) — where the Firth of Forth meets the North Sea — is a
good place to kick off a day trip. The town dates to the 14th century; in

the more modern Victorian and Edwardian times, it was rebuilt to serve
as an up-market holiday resort, drawing visitors to its beaches, harbor,
and golf courses.
Getting there
About 36km (21 miles) east of Edinburgh, North Berwick is on a direct
rail line from Edinburgh; the trip takes about 30 minutes. Standard one-
way fare is £4.50 ($8.30). Bus service from Edinburgh takes a bit over an
hour. An all-day ticket to North Berwick and the region around it costs
£5.50 ($10).Or you can hit the road on the bus service from Edinburgh,
which takes 11⁄4 hours and leaves from Edinburgh Bus Station. If you’re
driving, take the coastal road east from Leith, or use the A1 (marked THE
SOUTH and DUNBAR), to the A198 (via Gullane) to North Berwick.
Orienting yourself
At North Berwick’s tourist office on Quality Street (% 01620-892-197),
you can get information on boat trips to offshore islands, including Bass
Rock, a breeding ground inhabited by about 10,000 gannets (the second
largest colony in Scotland) as well as puffins and other birds. You can see
the rock from the harbor, but the viewing is even better at Berwick Law,
an eroded, once volcanic lookout point that rises up behind the town.
Seeing the sights
Dirleton Castle
Dirleton
Run by Historic Scotland, Dirleton Castle dates to the 13th century with
surrounding gardens — for some, the main attraction — that are appar-
ently just as ancient. Reputed to have been completely sacked in 1650 by
Cromwell, another story holds that the building was only partially
destroyed by his army but was further torn down by a local family. After
building nearby Archerfield House, the owners desired a romantic ruin on

Dirleton: Prettiest village in Scotland?
Dirleton, midway between North Berwick and Gullane, is one of the prettiest villages
in Scotland. It’s as picture-perfect as a postcard. In fact, its quaintness and beauty
makes it seem almost surreal. Undoubtedly high levels of home maintenance make
each cottage here look as if it’s waiting to be photographed. Because the main road
bypasses the village, there’s very little traffic. Even the railway station is closed — the
last train ran through Dirleton in the mid-1950s! The biggest event for Dirleton occurred
in the 1940s, when President Roosevelt and Sir Winston Churchill met here to plan D-
Day landings.

North Berwick
From this popular attraction situated on a craggy outcropping in North
Berwick, you can watch all the bird action out on Bass Rock, whether gan-
nets and puffins, as well as guillemots on the island of Fidra or colonies of
seals thanks to live video links — or in modern parlance: “Big Brother”
cameras. The Seabird Centre also has a cafe/bistro and activities geared to
the family. Allow about two hours here.

Tantallon Castle
Tantallon
After its construction in the 14th century on a bluff right above the sea,
this became the stronghold of the powerful and somewhat trouble-making
Douglas family — the Earls of Angus, who tended to side with England in
their wars and disputes with Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries. Both
Stuart kings James IV and James V dispatched troops to Tantallon. Like
most castles in the region, it endured a fair number of seizes, but the
troops of Oliver Cromwell well and truly sacked it in the mid-1600s.
Nevertheless, the ruins remain formidable, with a square five-story cen-
tral tower. Allow one hour.

Dunbar: Birthplace of John Muir
The man who “discovered” the Yosemite Valley in California, founded the Sierra Club,
and was single-handedly responsible for establishing the national park system in the
United States was born in the humble harbor town of Dunbar about 15km (9 miles)
southeast of North Berwick. Scots have been slow to capitalize on Muir’s international
stature and celebrate the life of the explorer, naturalist, and ground-breaking conser-
vationist. In Dunbar, you can visit his birthplace (126 High St.; % 01368-865-899;
www.jmbt.org.uk) which now houses a museum about Muir, his travels, and his
work. It is a modest, locally run museum, but if you’re a fan of John Muir and appre-
ciate the environmental movement, then a visit here is merited.

Gullane
SCOTTISH/FRENCH
This elegant Edwardian country house was designed in 1901 by the most
renowned architect of the day, Sir Edwin Lutyens, and the grounds were
laid out by one of England’s most respected gardeners, Gertrude Jekyll.
The light, Scottish/French-style dishes (Scottish haute cuisine is often
French in style) served in the elegant dining room, which overlooks the
tenth tee of Muirfield (see the sidebar “Gullane and Muirfield Golf
Course”), are almost as appealing to the eye as to the palate; specialties
include fresh seafood such as seared filet of line-caught seabass with saf-
fron risotto cake. If you decide to make a night of it, Greywalls also has
guest rooms.

Gullane and Muirfield Golf Course
Situated about 8km (5 miles) west of North Berwick and some 28km (16 miles) east of
Edinburgh, Gullane (pronounced gill-in by many, gull-an by others) is another Scottish
resort town with a fine beach and a famous golf course. On the edge of the village,
Gullane Hill provides a nature reserve and bird sanctuary where over 100 species of
birds have been spotted. You cross a small wood footbridge from the car park to enter
the reserve. Gullane doesn’t get any direct rail service, but the nearest station is only
about 4km (21⁄2 miles) south in Drem. Buses depart to Gullane from the Edinburgh bus
terminal near St. Andrew’s Square (% 0800-232-323 for information) and take about
one hour.
Muirfield Golf Course (% 01620-842-123) is ranked among the world’s great golf
courses, and as such, it has hosted the Open Championship in Great Britain. Muirfield
is the home course of the Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers — the world’s
oldest golf club — which began at Leith Links in Edinburgh. Developed on a boggy
piece of low-lying land in 1891, Muirfield was originally a 16-hole course designed by
the legendary Old Tom Morris. Visitors with certified handicaps can play Muirfield on
Tuesdays and Thursdays. Greens fees are £145 ($268) for a single round and £180 ($333)
for the day. Peak times book quickly, but the course usually has availability from mid-
October to the end of March.

2003. The three-course lunches and four-course dinners offer dishes that
are French-inspired, but the selection might also include a Thai-influenced
soup, too. The menu is seasonal, and the produce is usually purchased
locally, with everything freshly made on the premises.

West Lothian
Linlithgow, where Mary Queen of Scots was born in 1542, is the princi-
pal town for tourists in West Lothian and its ancient palace is the main
attraction. Falkirk is a central market town further west, while South
Queensferry sits on the south banks of the Forth River.
Getting there
Linlithgow is only 26km (16 miles) west of Edinburgh. Trains depart 
frequently from Edinburgh Waverley Station for the 20-minute ride. A
standard round-trip ticket costs about £6.50 ($12). If you’re driving from
Edinburgh, follow the M8 toward Glasgow, take exit 2 onto the M9, and
follow the signs to Linlithgow.

The tourist information center is on the road that leads up to the palace.
It’s open daily from Easter through October.

Rosslyn Chapel: the Da Vinci 
Code Connection
In no small thanks to the Dan Brown’s blockbuster novel, The Da Vinci Code, and the
Hollywood film, the elaborately carved Rosslyn Chapel south of Edinburgh is firmly on
the trail of those who seek to retrace the historic and mythical path of the Knights
Templar. Visitor numbers doubled in the run-up to the release of the movie, part of
which was filmed here. The chapel was founded in 1446 by Sir William St. Clair, and it
has been long noted for its architectural and design idiosyncrasies (though not all of
those mentioned in Brown’s tome). The attraction is in Midlothian and can be easily
reached by the A701, which runs south from Edinburgh. For more information, open-
ing hours and ticket prices call % 0131-440-2159 or log on to www.rosslyn-

Hopetoun House
Near South Queensferry
On the margins of South Queensferry, amid beautifully landscaped
grounds, Hopetoun House is one of Scotland’s best examples of 18th-cen-
tury palatial Georgian architecture, featuring design work by Sir William
Bruce — and by no less than three members of the architecturally inclined
Adam family. You can wander through splendid reception rooms filled with
period furniture, Renaissance paintings, statuary, and other artworks. The
views of the Firth of Forth are panoramic from the rooftop observation
deck. After touring the house, visitors should try to take in the grounds,
some 60 hectares (150 acres) of parkland with a walled garden, shorefront
trail, and deer park. Last entry is one hour before closing. Allow two hours.

Linlithgow Palace
Linlithgow
Birthplace of Mary Queen of Scots, this was a favorite residence of Scottish
royalty, and it is now one of the Scotland’s most poignant ruins, set on the
shores of Linlithgow Loch. Enough of the royal rooms are still intact so that
visitors can get an idea of how grand the palace once was. It is a landmark
bit of architecture in the country—the first building to be called a palace—
and a romantic touchstone of Scottish history and lore. The English king
Edward I occupied the tower in the 14th century, but Scots who had hidden
in a load of hay retook it in 1313. Most of the structure was built by Scotland’s
King James I from 1425 to 1437. In 1513, Queen Margaret (a Tudor by birth)
waited in vain here for husband James IV to return from the battle of Flodden.
When their son, James V, also born here, wed Mary of Guise, the palace foun-
tain ran with wine. In 1746, fire gutted the building when government troops
who routed Bonnie Prince Charlie at Culloden were barracked in Linlithgow.
Last admission 45 minutes before closing. Allow two hours.

St. Michael’s Parish Church
Linlithgow
Next to Linlithgow Palace stands the medieval kirk of St. Michael, site of wor-

pre-Reformation parish church in Scotland, it was mostly constructed in the
15th century. In St. Catherine’s Aisle, just before the battle of Flodden, King

James IV apparently saw an apparition warning him against fighting the
English. Perhaps he should have listened. Despite being ravaged by the dis-
ciples of John Knox (who chided followers for their “excesses”) and trans-
formed into a stable by Cromwell’s forces, this remains one of Scotland’s
best examples of a parish church. While providing a dramatic focal point on
the landscape, the aluminum spears projecting from the tower were added
in the 1960s. Allow one hour.

From its headwaters well south of Glasgow, the River Clyde meanders
north towards the city and then west to the sea. The Clyde Valley south
of the city is best known locally for its garden nurseries and their some-
times-quaint tea shops. Near the town of Lanark, however, you can find
a bona fide bit of history and an attraction that merits a day trip.

was a progressive industrial mill and village under the guidance of Robert
Owen, who decided that a contented work force was most likely to be a
productive one. With that philosophy in mind, he set up free education for
all employees and their children, a day-care center and social club, and a
cooperative store along the banks of the River Clyde in the steep valley
below the long-established market town of Lanark. Today, the New Lanark
Conservation Trust runs the place (recognized by UNESCO as a World
Heritage Site) as a tourist attraction. Admission includes an educational
chair-lift ride that tells the story of what life here was once like as well as
self-guided tours of the principle buildings, such as the factory where
cotton was spun and the old school house. A walk upstream brings visitors
to the three-tiered Falls of Clyde, worth the hike if you like waterfalls and
walking. Allow two hours.
See map p. 257. Braxfield Road, outside Lanark. % 01555-661-345. www.new
lanark.org. Admission £5.95 ($11) adults, £4.95 ($9.15) children and seniors, £18
($33) family of four. Open: daily 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
West of Glasgow
West of Glasgow, the Clyde widens as it empties into the sea. To get to
places west, take the train that runs almost every half hour from Queen
Street Station or head out on the M8 motorway, crossing the river at
Erskine and following the northern shoreline. The area doesn’t boast a
host of attractions, but the drive can be very pretty, and in Helensburgh,
the Mackintosh trail leads to the architect and designer’s wonderful Hill
House.
Glenarn Garden
Rhu near Helensburgh
Nestled in a protective hollow, Glenarn is a private garden established by
the Gibson family in the early decades of the 20th century. The rhodo-
dendron collection is superb, and in early spring the flowering magnolias
Chapter 13: Going Beyond Edinburgh and Glasgow: Day Trips 263

can be absolutely stunning. A large rock garden has also been built around
a unused quarry. Allow one hour.
See map p. 257. Glenarn Road, off the A814, Rhu. % 01436-820-493. Admission: £3
($5.55). Open: mid-Mar to Sept dawn–dusk.
Hill House
Helensburgh
Designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for publisher Walter Blackie, this
timeless house on the hill above the town of Helensburgh (about 48km/30
miles west of Glasgow) has been lovingly restored and opened to the
public by the National Trust for Scotland. Inspired by the Scottish Baronial
style, Hill House is still pure Mackintosh: from the asymmetrical juxtapo-
sition of windows and clean lines that blend sharp geometry and gentle
curves to the sumptuous but uncluttered interior with custom-made
details (such as glass inlays, fireplace tiles and decorative panels) by both
the architect and his artist wife Margaret Macdonald. Built at the begin-
ning of the 20th century, practically the entire house is open to the public.
The garden, overgrown when the National Trust took over the property in
the early 1980s, has been restored to its original state thanks to photo-
graphs of the original garden taken in 1905 for a German design magazine.
Allow two hours here.
See map p. 257. Upper Colquhoun Street, off the B832, Helensburgh. % 01436-673-
900. www.nts.org.uk. Admission: £8 ($15) adults, £5 ($9.25) seniors, £20 ($37)
family. Open: Apr–Oct daily 1:30–5:30 p.m. Closed Nov–Mar.
Newark Castle
Port Glasgow
One of the few castles still standing in this part of Scotland, Newark dates
to the 15th century. Its most prominent resident was Patrick Maxwell, who
made notable additions to the castle but went down in history as a bully
who murdered a couple of neighbors and regularly beat his wife. Nice chap,
eh? You can see a good deal of this well-preserved castle, from the tower
house built in 1478 to a wood-paneled sleeping chamber and the high ceil-
ings of the main hall, in addition to the old gate house. Allow one hour.
See map p. 257. On the A8, Port Glasgow. % 01475-741-858. www.historic-
scotland.gov.uk. Admission: £3($5.55) adults, £2.30 ($4.25) seniors and students,
£1.30 ($2.40) children. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m. Closed Nov–Mar.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
264

Part IV
The Major Regions

In this part . . .
S
ome travelers just visit Edinburgh and Glasgow (dis-
cussed in Part III) and stop there. That’s okay, but if you
have more time, you really should get out and about and dis-
cover some of the rest of the “real” Scotland — whether the
medieval abbeys of southern Scotland, the picturesque ports
of Argyll and in the Hebrides, or the sweeping vistas and
rugged countryside of the Highlands.
Part IV focuses in on the major regions of Scotland. In the
chapters that follow, you can ﬁnd out about each region’s
best attributes — from harbor towns, whiskey distilleries,
and world-class golf to ancient castles, loch cruises, and
largely unspoiled islands. Each chapter has invaluable sug-
gestions on how to get there and get around, which attrac-
tions to see, and, of course, where to stay and dine.

Chapter 14
Southern Scotland
In This Chapter
 Finding the best places to stay and eat
 Discovering the home of Sir Walter Scott
 Seeing the famous Borders abbeys
 Visiting one of the most picturesque ports in Scotland
R
ichly historic southern Scotland is predominantly rural, with vast
open spaces used for grazing livestock such as the famous black-
face lamb. The area consists of two administrative districts: the Borders,
aptly named as it borders England, and the combined regions of Dumfries
(pronounced dum-freese) and Galloway in the southwest. Because most
tourists enter Scotland by plane or train, arriving in either Glasgow or
Edinburgh, many tend to travel through southern Scotland rather than
journey to the region. But there are good reasons to visit here.
Sure, the area isn’t as impressive as the Highlands (see Chapter 18)
when it comes to natural beauty. Still, the southern part of the country
offers attractions that make a trip here worthwhile: stately homes and
the ruins of 12th-century abbeys, quaint towns, meandering rivers, and a
ruggedly scenic peninsula that faces onto the Irish Sea.
Southern Scotland has no regional capital, per se, nor even a bona fide
city. The main towns include Melrose, Jedburgh, and Galashiels in the
Borders southeast of Edinburgh; Dumfries and Stranraer are the main
hubs southeast and southwest of Glasgow, respectively.
Ideally, you could take two or three days to cover southern Scotland. But
certain attractions are within striking distance for day trips from either
Edinburgh or Glasgow, depending upon how long you allow your “day”
to be. For example, the drive from Glasgow to the town of Kirkcudbright
takes about two hours or so.
Getting There
Buses and (to a much lesser extent) trains run from Edinburgh to south-
ern Scotland. Cutbacks in the 1960s eliminated rail service that used to
penetrate the Borders interior, but one line is to be reopened this decade.

Until then, however, train service to the Borders is limited to the east
coast main line that runs from the Scottish capital to Berwick on Tweed,
just across the boundary in England.
Buses and trains from Glasgow head south into Dumfries and Galloway,
with a western railway line terminating at the sea port Stranraer and the
more central route continuing through Dumfries out of Scotland to
Carlisle.
A car is probably the best mode of transportation to cover southern
Scotland. To plan a trip by public transportation, call Traveline Scotland
on % 0870-608-2-608 or use its Web site www.travelinescotland.com.
 By car: From Edinburgh, take the A68 toward Jedburgh, the A1
along the east coast, or, further west, the A701 to the M74. From
Glasgow, the M74 runs south to Moffat, where the A701 continues
to the town of Dumfries. You can also get to Dumfries by taking the
A76, via Cumnock. If your destination is Galloway, take the A77
south via Ayr and Girvan. If you want to experience the area from
England, the M1 to Newcastle links to the A1 or the A68 (via the
A69). Coming from northwest England and the Lake District, take
the M6 north to the M74 in Carlisle. Cross-country roads from
Stranraer to Galashiels are predominantly two-lane routes with a
good bit of twists and turns.
 By bus: Scottish Citylink (% 0870-550-5050; www.citylink.co.uk)
routes cover some towns in the region. National Express (% 08705-
808-080; www.nationalexpress.com) and Stagecoach (% 01292-
613-500) also have buses that run into Southern Scotland. A stan-
dard one-way bus ticket from Edinburgh to Melrose costs about
£6.50 ($12).
 By train: First ScotRail (% 08457-484-950; www.firstscotrail.
com) travels to towns in the region, including Berwick on Tweed,
Dumfries, and Stranraer. A typical one-way fare from Glasgow to
Stranraer is about £17 ($31).
 By ferry: Stena Line (% 0870-1129-374; www.stenaline.
ferries.org) runs ferry services between Stranraer harbor 
and Belfast port in Northern Ireland.
Spending the Night
The selections I list below offer some of the best accommodations in 
the region. All are moderate to expensive, which is typical for southern
Scotland, and many have good food for dinner and full bars for a friendly
pint or nightcap. Some have earned star ratings from the tourist board
(see Chapter 8 for a description of the rating system). Rates include full
breakfast unless otherwise stated. And remember: You may well get a
better deal than the advertised “rack” rates.

Melrose
Within walking distance of Melrose Abbey, this family-run inn was built in
1722 to house a local dignitary. The traditional exterior offers a taste of
small-town Scotland, although much of the interior décor is modern, with
an airy and restful feel. All 20 guestrooms are well furnished and equipped
with shower-only bathrooms. The restaurant menu offers main courses
such baked halibut with crab and pea risotto, and in addition to the more
formal dining room, Burt’s serves meals in the bistro/bar. Alternative
accommodations are offered across the street at the Townhouse Hotel,
with double rooms starting at £96 ($178).

This early 20th-century resort hotel with a stone facade is a wonderful
place to go for a little R&R. The rooms are very comfortable, but the best
features here are the spa and heated indoor pool. The hotel has some 91
units, with 22 suitable for family accommodations. An added conference
facility is designed to appeal to a business clientele, but the Cairndale still
knows how to treat vacationing guests right.

It doesn’t offer the poshest accommodations in this quaint port town, but
the popular and unpretentious Crown is right on the harbor, and the

This beautifully decorated pile close to the city of Stranraer offers
Victorian baronial splendor with antiques, oil paintings, and elegant
touches at every turn. The mansion was designed in the 1870s by David
Bryce, a celebrated architect of his day, and it overlooks the Irish Sea.
Lounges and dining rooms are elegant, and the spacious bedrooms and
suites are individually furnished. Tall windows let in the afternoon and long
summer evening light, making the rooms bright on many days. The hotel,
open seasonally unless by special arrangement, stands on 12 hectares (30

This small, luxury hotel with well-manicured lawns and gardens, as well
as its own private beach in a sheltered cove, is a few miles south of
Portpatrick. There are only nine rooms in the country manor house tradi-
tion, with brass fittings on tubs and tiled fireplaces in some of the units. In
this tranquil and remote setting, Churchill, Eisenhower, and their staff met
in WWII. Meals are outstanding, the bar excels in its whisky selection, and
the kitchen has earned a Michelin star.

Once a Victorian hydropathic hotel that claimed to cure whatever ailed

Exploring Southern Scotland
Among the Borders’s primary attractions are its stately, historic homes
and ancient abbeys. The rolling hills and dense forests of Galloway are
attractive but don’t quite offer the kind of natural splendor found in the
Highlands of Scotland, although the coastal areas are reasonably dra-
matic and picturesque. The government’s historic preservation society,
Historic Scotland, runs quite a few of the attractions in southern Scotland.
I list several below, but for more details, go to the agency’s Web site at
www.historic-scotland.gov.uk. Don’t feel as if you need to visit each
and every abbey and castle in the area. Pick some representative ones,
enjoy them, and move on.

Abbottsford is the mansion that Sir Walter Scott built and lived in from
1817 until his death. Designed in the Scots baronial style, Abbotsford was
constructed on land he acquired in 1811. After his literary works, it is con-
sidered the author’s most enduring monument. Scott was a souvenir
hunter, scouring the land for artifacts associated with the historical char-
acters he rendered into fiction. Hence, Abbotsford contains many relics
and mementos — whether Rob Roy’s sporran or a purse made by Flora
Macdonald. One of his other proud possessions is a sword given to the
duke of Montrose by Charles I for his cooperation (some say collabora-
tion). The home itself has an entrance that mimics the porch at Linlithgow
Palace and a door from Edinburgh’s Tollbooth. Especially popular is Scott’s
small study, with writing desk and chair, where he penned some of his
most famous works. There are also extensive gardens and grounds to visit,
plus the private chapel, added after Scott’s death. Allow about two hours.

Burns House
Dumfries
Most of the Robert Burns Heritage Trail is in Ayrshire (see Chapter 15),
but the poet Burns lived the final years of his short life in this house, where
he died at age 37 in 1796. Burns House has been preserved to look as it
did when he resided there for the final few years of his short life, and it
contains such articles as Burns’s writing chair as well as some original
manuscripts, letters, and printed editions. A highlight is the author’s sig-
nature scratched into a windowpane. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 269. Burns Street, between Shakespeare and St. Michael’s streets. %01387-

Caerlaverock Castle
Near Dumfries
A historic target of English armies, Caerlaverock is one of Scotland’s clas-
sic Medieval castles, complete with moat and twin-towered gatehouse, as
well as some pretty serious battlements. It lies in secured ruins today, but
you can still get the sense of what defending this castle may have been
like. An exhibit on siege warfare, a nature trail, and an “adventure” park,
which kids might enjoy, are all on the premises. A cafe is open during the
summer and on weekends throughout the winter. Allow about two hours.

Dryburgh Abbey
Near St. Boswells
It’s no wonder Sir Walter Scott chose this spot to be buried. The abbey
ruins, now run under the auspices of Historic Scotland, lie amid giant
cedar trees on the banks of the River Tweed. Of the four famed Borders
abbeys, Dryburgh was the largest, arguably the most beautiful, and possi-
bly the most attacked by English troops, although it’s reasonably well
intact today. Dryburgh’s pleasant green surroundings make a lovely spot
for a picnic lunch. Scott was interred in the side chapel in 1832. Allow
about one hour.

Chapter 14: Southern Scotland 275
Sir Walter Scott: Inventor of historic novels
Today it may be hard to imagine the fame that Walter Scott, poet and novelist, enjoyed
as the best-selling author of his day. His works are no longer so widely read, but Scott
(1771–1832) was thought to be a master storyteller and today is considered the inven-
tor of the historic novel. Before his Waverley series was published in 1814, no modern
English author had spun such tales from actual events, examining the lives of individ-
uals who played a role in history — large and small. He created lively characters and
realistic pictures of Scottish life in works such as The Heart of Midlothian.
Born into a Borders family who then settled in Edinburgh on August 14, 1771, Scott
was permanently disabled due to polio he contracted as a child. All his life he was
troubled by ill health and later by ailing finances as well. He spent his latter years writ-
ing to clear enormous debts incurred when his publishing house and printers collapsed
in bankruptcy.
Scott made his country and its scenery fashionable with the English, and he played a
key role in bringing George IV to visit Scotland. Although Scott became the most promi-
nent literary figure in Edinburgh, his heart remained in the Borders, where he built his
home. Starting with a modest farmhouse, he created Abbotsford, a mansion that
became a key tourist destination (see the listing for Abbotsford in the section “The top
attractions”).

Floors Castle
Near Kelso
This mansion was built by William Adam for the first duke of Roxburghe in
1721, and it is today still home to the duke (the tenth) and duchess of
Roxburghe. More sprawling country house than a proper castle, Floors
Castle can still claim to be one of the few fully intact and the largest inhab-
ited castle in all of Scotland. After viewing the impressive art collection
indoors (including paintings by Matisse and Odilon Redon in the Needle
Room), venture out and walk one of the nature trails through the woods or
along the River Tweed. The walled garden also has an “adventure” play-
ground for the kids. Allow about three hours.

11 a.m.–5 p.m. Winter group visits by prior arrangement.
Jedburgh Abbey
Jedburgh
This famous ruined abbey, founded by David I in 1138, is one of Scotland’s
finest. Under the Augustinian canons from Beauvais, France, it achieved
abbey status in 1152 and went on to witness much royal pageantry, such
as the marriage of Alexander III to his second wife, Yolande de Dreux. In
1544 and 1545, the English sacked the abbey during the frequent wars of
the period. After 1560, few efforts were made to repair the abbey. For about
300 years, a small section of it served as Jedburgh’s parish church, but in
1875 other premises were found for day-to-day worship. Teams of archi-
tects then set to work restoring the abbey to its original medieval design.
The abbey is still roofless but otherwise fairly complete, with most of its
exterior stonework still in place.

Little Sparta
Near Dunsyre
Not highlighted by many guidebooks, this garden was devised by one of
Scotland’s most intriguing artists, the late Ian Hamilton Finlay, who died
on March 27, 2006. It is a surprisingly lush plot of land, given the harsh ter-
rain of the Pentland Hills all around it. Dotted throughout the garden are
stone sculptures (many with Finlay’s pithy sayings and poems) created in
collaboration with master stonemasons and other artists. Little Sparta has
been called the “only original garden” created in Great Britain since World
War II and in the wake of Finlay’s death a trust has been established to
ensure its survival. Allow about one hour.

Logan Botanic Garden
Rhinns of Galloway
Run by the Royal Botanic Garden responsible for the beautiful spread in
Edinburgh (see Chapter 11), the gardens on the old Logan estate have
charms of their very own. Because of its southwest exposure (which
brings mild Gulf Stream air flows) and some protective planting, the gar-
dens have a microclimate that allows the successful cultivation of palms,
tree ferns, and other exotic plants such as towering, flowering columns of
echium pininana, native to the Canary Islands. In addition to the more
formal walled garden, Logan also has wilder plantings such as the gunnera,
with its leaves larger than elephant’s ears. Hand-held audio wands can be
for used for self-guided tours, and there’s an interpretative center with
microscopes, too. Allow about two hours.

daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Nov–Feb.
Melrose Abbey
Melrose
These lichen-covered ruins are all that’s left of an ecclesiastical commu-
nity established by Cistercian monks in the 12th century. While the soar-
ing walls you see follow the lines of the original abbey, they were largely
constructed in the 15th century. The Gothic design moved Sir Walter Scott
to write in the Lay of the Last Minstrel, “If thou would’st view fair Melrose
aright, go visit in the pale moonlight.” The author was also instrumental in
Chapter 14: Southern Scotland 277
Portpatrick
The site of a natural harbor that has been improved over the years, Portpatrick brought
traders from Northern Ireland from the 17th century to the mid–19th century. Although
a more sheltered port was established at Stranraer and ferries stopped coming here,
Portpatrick remains one of the most picturesque towns in southwest Scotland. Trails
lead away from the village, both up and down the coast. Just south of the town, the
path leads to the ruins of 15th-century Dunskey Castle, perched on the edge of a cliff
above the sea. In the small inlet below is a small beach that seems to capture no end
of golf balls hit astray from seaside courses somewhere along the coast. From
Portpatrick, the 200-plus mile long Southern Upland Way, one of the greatest long-dis-
tance footpaths in Scotland, heads northeast across Scotland from coast to coast.
Also worth visiting are the Dunskey Gardens on the eastern outskirts of the town.

ensuring that the decayed remains were preserved in the 19th century.
You can still view its sandstone shell, filled with elongated windows and
carved capitals, and the finely decorated masonry. It is believed that the
heart of Robert the Bruce is interred in the abbey, per his wishes. Allow
about 11⁄2 hours.

Sweetheart Abbey
New Abbey
The impressive remains of Sweetheart Abbey are worth the short jaunt
from Dumfries. An unusual story lies behind the red sandstone structure:
Lady Devorgilla of Galloway founded the abbey in 1273 in memory of her
husband. She carried his embalmed heart around with her for 22 years,
and when she was buried here, in front of the altar, the heart went with
her, thus the name Sweetheart Abbey. Allow about one hour.

Threave Castle
The River Dee
One of the best things about this massive 14th-century tower house (a
ruined proper castle) is how you get here. Ring a bell to call a boatman,
who ferries you to the island in the River Dee on which the castle sits.
Threave Castle was built by Archibald the Grim, the third earl of Douglas.
The castle was last used in the 19th century as a prison for Napoleonic
War soldiers. Bird watchers enjoy an opportunity to get up close and per-
sonal with the swallows that nest in the ruins from April to September.
Note: Leave your best shoes at home; the path from the parking area to
the boat pickup can get muddy when it rains. And, unlike most Historic
Scotland properties in southern Scotland, Threave is closed from October
through March. Allow about one hour.

Traquair House
Innerleithen
Little changed since the beginning of the 18th century and dating in part
to the 12th century, this is perhaps Scotland’s most romantic house, rich
in associations with ancient kings, Mary Queen of Scots, and the Jacobite

uprisings. The Stuarts of Traquair still live in the great mansion, making it,
they say, the oldest continuously inhabited house in Scotland. One of the
most poignant exhibits is in the King’s Room: an ornately carved 
oak cradle, in which Mary rocked her infant son, who was to become James
VI of Scotland and James I of England. Other treasures include embroi-
deries, silver, manuscripts, and paintings. Of particular interest is the brew-
ery, still in operation, producing very fine ales. On the grounds are craft
workshops — such as wrought ironwork and woodturning — as well as a
maze and woodland walks. There are three rather sumptuous overnight
rooms, too, at £180 ($333) including full breakfast. Allow about two hours.

More cool things to see and do
 Glen Trool, 13km (8 miles) north of Newton Stewart (off the A714),
is good place to a hike of a few hours on one of the best short walks
in Dumfries and Galloway. The trail that circumnavigates Loch
Trool is moderate to easy. On the southern banks, the army of
Robert the Bruce is believed to have defeated a much stronger
English force in 1307 and across the loch on a high point is Bruce’s
Stone, which commemorates the victory. 
 Mary Queen of Scots House, Queen Street, Jedburgh (% 01835-
863-331). As the story goes, in 1566 Mary was on a trip to visit her
betrothed, the Earl of Bothwell, when she became ill with fever. She
allegedly stayed in this house to recover. Now the building is a visi-
tor center that tells the tragic story of her life and features magnifi-
cent tapestries, oil paintings, antique furniture, coats of arms, armor,
and some of the Queen’s possessions.

Kirkcudbright: The Artists’ Town
Kirkcudbright (pronounced kerr-coo-bree) became a thriving artists’ colony in the late
19th and early 20th century, drawing many notable artists such as leading “Glasgow
Boy” E.A. Hornel, genius graphic artist Jessie M. King, and “Scottish Colourist” S.J.
Peploe. The appeal of this cute village remains, although the colony is more of a her-
itage spot these days, with galleries keeping the artistic history alive. The center of
town is full of small, colorful cottages, many with charming wee lanes. From April
through September, you can visit Hornel’s home, Broughton House, a Georgian era
mansion that the artist adapted and expanded to include a studio. The garden is spe-
cial, too. Call % 01557-330-437 or log on to the National Trust for Scotland’s Web site:
www.nts.org.

 The Old Bridge House Museum, Mill Road, Dumfries (% 01387-
256-904). This museum is housed in the oldest building in Dumfries,
a 1660 sandstone structure built into the Devorgilla Bridge. Today,
the museum is devoted to Victorian life. A mid–19th century kitchen
and antique dental tools are among the items on display.
 The Robert Burns Centre, Mill Road, Dumfries (% 01387-264-808)
is commonly called simply the “RBC.” On display are many interest-
ing items, such as a cast of Burns’s skull, a scale model of 1790s
Dumfries, and a sentimental audiovisual presentation of the poet’s
life. Also on display are original documents and relics belonging to
Burns. The center has a cafe and bookshop as well. Allow about
one hour.
 The Trimontium Exhibition, Market Square, Melrose (% 01896-
822-651). This small museum is devoted to Trimontium, the leg-
endary three-peaked Roman hill fort near Melrose. Among the col-
lection of 1st- and 2nd-century artifacts are a Roman skull and
facemask, tools, weapons, and pottery.
 Wigtown is Scotland’s official book town. Tucked down along the
wide estuary of Wigtown Bay (10km/6 miles south of Newton Stewart
on the A714), the village has virtually back-to-back used and anti-
quarian book shops, specializing often in Scottish titles. At Wigtown,
there is also an infamous Covenanters Monument where one of the
female followers of that 17th-century, diehard Presbyterian sect was
tied to a stake on the shoreline and made to drown in the rising tide.
Shopping for Local Treasures
The main street in places such as Dumfries or Peebles will usually have
small shops and clothing stores. Almost all of the attractions listed in
this chapter have well-stocked gift shops.
The town of Kelso is the home of Pettigrews (% 01573-224-234; www.
pettigrews.com), which produces a range of Scottish chutney and
relish at its factory here. In the town of Moffat, you can visit the Woollen
Mill (% 01683-220-134), which has weaving demonstrations and shops
with tartan, whisky, and more for sale, seven days a week. If you enjoy
books, set aside some time to visit Wigtown, of course, which is Scot-
land’s book town. But if art is more your bag, the seaside village of
Kirkcudbright has developed into an artists community with galleries
selling local works.
Here are a couple of other picks worth visiting.
 Lighthouse Pottery, south pier, Portpatrick (% 01776-810-284) is
good place to pick up a gift or two, with a selection of jewelry, pot-
tery, and other handmade local crafts. Open 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily.

280

 Broughton Gallery, Broughton Place, Broughton (% 01899-830-

lage near Biggar) exhibits contemporary art by Scottish and other
British artists and include paintings, glassware, and ceramics. Open
daily 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. during exhibits from April to December.
 Selkirk Glass, on the A7, Selkirk (% 01750-20954). This factory
shop and showroom is a popular stop for coach tours. But bargain
hunters may appreciate the factory prices for most of the glass-
ware. You can watch skilled craftsmen work in the factory as well.
Open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; closed holidays.
Hitting the Local Pubs
Almost every town in southern Scotland has one or two taverns, and
whether unimpressive or not, they often can be a good place to meet the
locals. Ask your hotel concierge or guesthouse host to recommend the
nearest “local” to your accommodations — walking distance preferred.
Worth special note is the Globe Inn, 56 High St., Dumfries (% 01387-
252-335; www.globeinndumfries.co.uk). Established at the beginning
of the 17th century, the Globe was one of poet Robert Burns’ favorite
haunts. You can even sit in Burns’ favorite seat, just to the left of the 
fireplace. Other good places for a pint and meal are the Crown in Port-
patrick and Burts in Melrose (see listing information for both in the
“Spending the Night” section, earlier in this chapter).

Ayrshire and Argyll
In This Chapter
 Getting to and getting to know Ayrshire and Argyll
 Seeking out the best places to stay and eat
 Discovering the Burns Heritage Trail, Culzean Castle, and more
 Hittin’ the links in Troon and Turnberry
 Exploring western peninsulas and islands
T
he region of Ayshire stretches from the southern and western fringes
of Glasgow south to southwest along the Firth of Clyde, bordering
Galloway in the south. Argyll, one of my favorite parts of Scotland,
covers the western peninsulas of central Scotland and adjacent islands,
the heart of the ancient kingdom of Dalriada. While Ayrshire boundaries
are fairly well marked, Argyll is a bit more amorphous, encompassing a
region that historically stretches into the Highlands and the inner
Hebridean islands.
One of Ayrshire’s primary attractions is “Burns Country,” because the
region was the poet Robert Burns’s birthplace as well as his predomi-
nant stomping grounds for most of his life. But Ayrshire also offers
golfers some of the best links courses in the world. If you take the train
from Glasgow to Ayr, the main town of Ayrshire, you can see one course
after another in the sandy dunes along the shoreline.
Argyll, which means the “coast of the Gaels,” encompasses islands such
as Bute and Gigha as well as the remote Kintyre Peninsula, which is iso-
lated enough that former-Beatle Paul McCartney has long owned a ranch
there where he retreats from prying eyes. One of the principle cities in
northern Argyll is the port of Oban (pronounced oh-bin), gateway to the
Hebrides. Other interesting settlements include Inveraray, on the upper
shores of Loch Fyne, and Tarbert midway down the Kintyre Peninsula.
I have included Islay (eye-la) in this chapter. While it is one of inner
Hebridean islands, and might logically seem to belong in chapter 19, it is
reached primarily from ports in Argyll, a region to which is it historically
connected. Conversely, information the Isle of Mull, which geographi-
cally could have been included here, is found in chapter 19 with the
other islands of the Hebrides.

If you don’t have the time or inclination to give Ayrshire and Argyll 
several days, remember that visits to places such as the mansion and
grounds of Culzean Castle or the quiet roads and beaches on the Isle of
Bute can be accomplished as day trips from Glasgow.
Getting There
Your options for getting in and out of the area include scheduled buses
and trains that run from Glasgow to a variety of towns, such as Ayr in
Ayrshire or Oban in Argyll. If you want to fully explore the Cowal or
Kintyre peninsulas or the Clyde coastline, a car is necessary. Of course,
ferry services provide the link to the islands (and even between the
peninsulas of Cowal and Kintyre). There are also flights to airports near
Cambeltown on the Kintyre peninsula and to the Isle of Islay.
 By car: From Glasgow, the main road to Ayrshire is the M77 (A77)
from the city’s Southside. It’s the fastest route to towns such as
Troon, Ayr, and points further south, such as Culzean. You can also
drive west on the M8, along the Clyde to Greenock or Gourock, con-
necting to the A78, which goes south along the Firth of Clyde to
ports such as Wemyss Bay or Ardrossan. To get to Argyll, take the
A82 from the West End of Glasgow north toward Tarbet on the
shores of Loch Lomond. From Tarbet, you can take the A83 to
Inveraray and down the Kintyre Peninsula or from the A83 to the
A815 down to Cowal. The fastest route to Oban is by using the A82
from Tarbet: Go north along Loch Lomond to Crianlarich and
Tyndrum, where the A85 goes west to Oban.
 By train: First ScotRail (% 0845-748-4950; www.firstscotrail.
com) service overlaps with the greater Glasgow rail service oper-
ated by Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT; % 0141-333 3708;
www.spt.co.uk). Between the two (and they’re largely inter-
changeable, unless you’re a dedicated trainspotter), you have rea-
sonably frequent service from Glasgow to Ayrshire and more
limited trains into Argyll. Remember, however, that trains going
southwest towards Ayr — or to Wemyss Bay — depart from Central
Station, while those going northwest towards Oban leave from
Queen Street Station. A one-way journey to Ayr (55 minutes) costs
around £6 ($11), to Wemyss Bay (50 minutes) £5 ($9.25), and to
Oban (three hours) £17 ($31).
 By bus: From Glasgow, Scottish Citylink (% 0141-332-9644 or
0870-550-5050; www.citylink.co.uk) runs buses to western
Scotland, including towns such as Inverary and Cambeltown. A
standard one-way ticket from Glasgow to Inverary is about £8 ($15)
and £15 ($28) to Campbeltown. The trip to Inverary takes about
two hours and to Cambeltown about five hours. Stagecoach
Express (% 01292-613-500; www.stagecoachbus.com) also runs
buses to Ayr from Glasgow’s Buchanan Street bus terminal. The
one-way fare to Ayr is £4.50 ($8.35) and the trip, using the limited

Chapter 15: Ayrshire and Argyll 285

 By ferry: Caledonian MacBrayne (% 08705-650-000 or 01475-
650-100; www.calmac.co.uk) — or CalMac, as it’s more colloquially
known — serves 22 islands and 4 peninsulas over the West Coast 
of Scotland. From Gourock, you can reach Dunoon on the Cowel
Peninsula (25-minute crossing). Ferries from Wemyss Bay go to
Rothesay on the Isle of Bute (35 minutes). The boat for Brodick on
Arran departs from Ardrossan (one-hour crossing). Connections
between railway terminals and ferry service are fairly well organized. 
There is a five-minute long crossing from northern Bute to Colin-
trave on the Cowal peninsula, and in summer you can also go from
Lochranza on Arran to the Kintyre peninsula near Skipness. A ferry
links the Cowal and Kintyre peninsulas from Portvadie to Tarbert
(25 minutes). From the west coast of Kintyre, ferries to the Isle of
Gigha leave from Tayinloan (20-minute crossing), while those to
Islay depart from Kennacraig (2 hours and 20 minutes).
On a trip across Argyll, you can take advantage of CalMac’s “Island
Hopscotch” ticket. For example, you may go from Wemyss Bay to
Rothesay on Bute, from Bute to the Cowal peninsula, and then from
Cowal to the pretty fishing village of Tarbert on Kintyre. Tickets are
around £7.50 ($14) per passenger and £35 ($65) for a car. It’s fun
and sidesteps the much longer, albeit scenic, road routes. Unless
you love driving, take the ferries.
CalMac has some competition from another company, Western
Ferry (% 01396-704-452; www.western-ferries.co.uk) which
runs a route to Hunter’s Quay in Dunoon from McInroy’s Point in
Gourock. 
 By air: British Airway (% 0870-850-9850) coordinates direct flights
from Glasgow airport to Cambeltown and Islay, but there are only
one or two per day, operated by BA’s local partner Loganair. Typi-
cally, they cost around £125 ($231) and the travel time is 45 minutes.
Spending the Night
When it comes to overnight rooms, you have a variety of options, from
luxury country house hotels to basic B&Bs and self-catering options.
Some have received star ratings from the tourist board, aka VisitScotland,
which I occasionally note (please see Chapter 8 for a description of the
rating system). In the listings below, room rates generally include full
breakfast, unless otherwise stated. And don’t forget: You may well get a
better deal than the standard “rack” rates that I quote.
Abbotsford Hotel

Ayr, Ayrshire
About a half-mile from the centre of Ayr, this small hotel with a popular,
civilized pub is curiously named after Sir Walter Scott’s mansion rather
than associating itself with local Ayrshire hero Robert Burns. It is located

in a quiet residential neighborhood, less than a ten-minute walk to the
shoreline and convenient to the local golf courses, too. Most of the units
are smart and comfortable, with flat-screen TVs and modern bathrooms.
Family-run and friendly, the Abbotsford offers sound, moderately priced
accommodations.

An Lochan
$$$
Tighnabruaich, Argyll
Formerly the Royal Hotel, this 11-bedroom, four-star inn overlooking the sea
in Tighnabruaich offers plenty of comforts and some luxurious rooms, but
not a hint of pretension or attitude from the McKie family owners or staff.
The “superior sea view” rooms fit the bill, additionally offering huge super
king-size beds and ample bathrooms (with tubs and showers), comfy
leather-upholstered furnishings, and little goodies such as fresh fruit on
arrival. Meals in either of the two conservatory dining rooms (see entry later
in “Dining locally”) highlight fresh seafood and fish caught nearby (even the
names of the scallop divers are given). The menu also offers Argyll-shire
venison and beef. A treatment room offers facials and massages.
See map p. 287. Tighnabruaich, Argyll % 01700-811-236. Fax: 01700-811-300 www.

Ardanaiseig Hotel
$$$
Kilchrenan, Argyll
This hotel is arguably the poshest and least accessible place listed in this
chapter, so if you seek a bit of luxury in an out-of-the-way corner, read on.
The Ardanaiseig (pronounced ard-na-sag) hotel is a stone Scottish baronial
pile built in the 1830s on the shores of Loch Awe; it sits at the end of a curvy
single-track road through the woods some 24km (15 miles) from Taynuilt
(off the main road to Oban). The gardens are especially colorful in spring
when the rhododendrons are in bloom, but they have plenty of year-round
interest as well. The public spaces include a large drawing room with views
of the hotel’s own wee island in the loch. Evening meals, supervised by
head chef Gary Goldie, are especially memorable, and every day brings a
different four-course menu. The hotel, which prefers not to take small chil-
dren, recently converted the loch-side boatshed into a luxury retreat.
See map p. 287. 5km (3 miles) north of Kilchrenan, off the B845 from Taynuilt. 
% 01866-833-333. Fax: 01866-833-222. www.ardanaiseig.com. Rack rates: £100–

by Robert Adam, was built over 250 years ago as a coach house to accom-
modate guests of the third duke of Argyll at nearby Inveraray Castle. Today,
the hotel is still welcoming the castle’s many tourist visitors, as well as other
travelers in Argyll. Recently added to the public rooms was a conservatory
facing the loch. If you can afford paying a bit more, book a room with a sea
view for yourself. Advance reservations offer discounts on rack rates.

Fairfield House Hotel
$$$
Ayr, Ayrshire
On the seafront at the edge of Ayr’s Low Green, this Victorian mansion/
country home was restored and converted into a four-star hotel. The staff
is attentive and, like the Abbotsford above, will help you arrange tee times
at nearby golf courses. Rooms in the main building are decorated in a
country-house style, while a newer wing offers more modern décor. The
units are generally large and luxurious; some of the bathrooms have
bidets. The hotel’s Martins Bar and Grill was named best informal dining
restaurant in 2006 by the Scottish hotel awards.

Gigha Hotel
$$
Isle of Gigha, Argyll
There aren’t many options on this lovely compact island just off the coast
of Kintyre, but the Gigha Hotel offers the main accommodations, run by the
community trust that now owns the isle. Rooms are fairly basic but clean
and tidy. Up top, directly facing the sea, are rooms 1 and 2, which share a
bathroom (and you might get a discount if requesting one of them).
Otherwise, all units have en suite facilities. Room 7 is spacious, overlooking
the rear garden with a bit of sea view. In addition, the hotel operates some
self-catering cabins around the island. The restaurant specializes in local,
fresh seafood dishes, while the pub is a popular gathering spot for the
islanders.

Harbour Inn
$$–$$$
Isle of Islay, Argyll
Right at the heart of Islay’s main town, Bowmore, and on the shores of
Loch Indaal, the four-star Harbour Inn is your best bet for overnight
accommodations on the Isle of Islay. It is well positioned for excursions
south to Port Ellen and distilleries such as Laphroaig, or around the bay
to picturesque towns, such as Portnahaven. I found room 5 a particularly
spacious, L-shaped unit with a big bathtub (though no shower). The
restaurant (see entry later in “Dining locally”) offers assured meals with
plenty of local produce, such as scallops from Lagavulin Bay.
See map p. 287. The Square, foot of Main Street, Bowmore % 01496-810-330. Fax:

Hunting Lodge Hotel
$$
Kintyre, Argyll
While the name led me to expect a 17th century inn, the Hunting Lodge’s
20th-century renovations have, alas, have rather masked most of historic
charms that this hotel on the road to Cambeltown once offered — at least
from the outside. But forgive the design of dormers and balconies and just
enjoy the views, especially the languid summer sunsets over the sea. Inside,
the whisky bar (with some 300 single malts) offers the character that the
hotel’s name promises, and the meals (served daily from noon–2:30 p.m.
and 6:30–9 p.m.) are excellent with plenty of local shellfish. 
See map p. 287. Just south of Bellchantuy on the A83. %01583-421-323. Fax: 01583-421-343.

Isle of Arran
This 300-year-old country house offers some of the best accommodation

furniture, fresh flowers, and pleasant pastel upholstery and drapes. The
hotel has an interesting collection of Japanese ornaments — but the cui-
sine in the dining room is Scottish with dishes such as roasted chestnut
soup or rack of lamb.

Loch Fyne Hotel
$$$
Inveraray, Argyll
Just north of town, this old stone house is perched on a lovely spot over
the loch. It offers a friendly hotel staff and a spa with a large pool, sauna,
steam room and outdoor hot tub (which certainly isn’t that common in
Scotland). The attractive rooms aren’t fancy, but some have beautiful
views of the water. Opt for the “executive size” units if you need more
space. The food in the restaurant is satisfying and a good value, while the
bar serves locally brewed real ales.

Troon, Ayrshire
This lovely country-house hotel is set on 12 lush hectares (30 acres) of
Ayrshire forest and landscaped gardens. The property opens onto views
of the Firth of Clyde and the rocky outcropping island of Ailsa Craig. The

Malin Court Hotel

Maidens, Ayrshire
On one of the most scenic strips of the Ayrshire coastline, this well-run
hotel fronts the Firth of Clyde. It is not a great country house, however,
but rather a serviceable, welcoming retreat offering a blend of informality
and comfort. The 18 bedrooms are mostly medium in size and overlook
the famous Turnberry golf course. Staff can arrange hunting, fishing,
riding, sailing, as well as 18 holes on the links. The hotel offers a 20 percent
discount for children younger than 16 staying in rooms separate from their

Troon, Ayrshire
Opposite Royal Troon and designed by William Leiper in 1899, this hotel
was originally occupied by Sir Alexander Walker of the Johnnie Walker
whisky family and remained a private residence until 1956. The importa-
tion of some 17,000 tons of topsoil transformed the estate’s marshy
grounds into a lush 1.6-hectare (4-acre) garden. The moderately sized
guest rooms have traditional country-house styling.

Turnberry, Ayrshire
The hotel at Turnberry, built in 1908, is a remarkable and well-known land-

dozens of gables. The public rooms contain Waterford crystal chandeliers,
Ionic columns, molded ceilings, and oak paneling. Each guest room is fur-

Dining Locally
Ayrshire and Argyll are dominated by vast coastline, so some of the finest
food you’ll find in the region highlights locally landed fish and seafood.
Below are what I think are some of the best dining options in the region.
An Lochan
$$–$$$
Tighnabruaich
FISH/SEAFOOD
At the former Royal Hotel, there are two restaurants. But whether you dine
in the casual Deck or in the more formal Crustacean, you’re always guar-
anteed a seaview and menus brimming with fresh fish, seafood, and meat
dishes, with all the primary ingredients sourced locally. Heck, they even
offer the names of the people who dive for the scallops and secure the
venison. If you’re up for it, there is a set-price evening menu, but the habit

cooking, allowing the natural flavors to set the tone.

Braidwoods
$$$
Dalry (Ayrshire)
FRENCH/SCOTTISH
One of the standout restaurants in Scotland, Braidwoods is housed in a
simple cottage (known as a “butt and ben”), which has been converted into
a small, rather exclusive (though not over formal) dining space southwest
of Glasgow. Keith and Nicola Braidwood share the cooking chores and the
place gets very busy on weekends. Holder of a Michelin star and other acco-
lades, Braidwoods is fairly expensive but worth the price for dishes such as
roast quail with black pudding or baked turbot on a smoked salmon risotto.

Ee-usk
$$
Oban
FISH/SEAFOOD
This modern restaurant’s name, the phonetic pronunciation of the Gaelic
for “fish,” sums up the place quite well. It serves a host of simple fish and
shellfish dishes, from the creamy delights of smoked haddock soup, Cullen
skink, to lightly breaded white fish or fresh shellfish platters. Located at
the recently renovated North Pier in Oban, on nice days, you can sit in the
sun on the bayside deck. Ee-usk has a good wine list and some rare
Scottish ales, too.

Enterkine House
$$$
Annbank
MODERN SCOTTISH
Dining at this highly rated, five-room country house hotel, done in Art
Deco from the 1930s, can be a special treat. East of Ayr in the village of
Annbank, Enterkine’s menus emphasize local ingredients, whether sea-
sonal game or fish landed at nearby Troon. The fixed-price dinners are
cheaper midweek. There are also some five-star quality overnight rooms,
while the “bothy” offers a quirkier pine lodge on the woodland estate.

Fouter’s Bistro
$$
Ayr
MODERN SCOTTISH
In the heart of Ayr, Fouter’s Bistro occupies the cellar of an old bank,
retaining the original stone floor and a vaulted ceiling. The restaurant’s
name derives from the Scottish expression “foutering about,” which is
equivalent to fiddling about. But no one’s goofing around here. Under new
ownership in 2003, the restaurant has one of the best reputations in the
region and emphasizes fresh local produce whenever possible.

Loch Fyne Restaurant and Oyster Bar
$$–$$$
Cairndow
FISH/SEAFOOD
On the road to Inveraray near the head of Loch Fyne is the famous Loch
Fyne Oyster Bar. The company that owns it farms both oysters and mus-
sels in the clear cool waters of the loch. With a glass of dry white wine at
this casual (although almost often busy) restaurant, there are few things
finer than a platter of raw oysters or some cooked fish dishes. Be sure to
browse the nice gift shop next door.

Troon
FISH/SEAFOOD
Near the ferry terminal at the harbor in Troon, this rustic seaside bistro is
adjacent to a fresh fish market run by the same company. Oysters, whole
sardines, grilled langoustines, sole, and combination platters are usually
on the menu here. They also recently added a great little fish and chip
shop, called the Wee Hurrie.

Russian Tavern at the Port Royal Hotel

Isle of Bute
RUSSIAN/SEAFOOD
You’re not likely find another place like this during your travels in Scotland.
In the village of Port Bannatyne just 3km (2 miles) north of Rothesay on the
Isle of Bute, the Port Royal is a family-run inn where the house specialties
are Russian cuisine (for example blinis, spicy sausage, and pavlova). And
not just that, but fresh fish and seafood are provided by a local fisherman,
as well as some rarely found Scottish ales served from kegs atop the bar in
the small cafe/pub they call the Russian Tavern. Overnight rooms, two with
en suite bathrooms, are basic rather than luxurious.

Kintyre
FISH/SEAFOOD
Open during the day from June to September, this operation south of
Tarbert (also called the Crab Shack) is worth a detour if you fancy seafood.
Food is cooked in a converted 1950s-style minitrailer next to a stone house
in the shadow of Skipness castle, and the meals feature langoustines, queen
scallops, mussels, smoked salmon, and more. It is completely unassuming,
with chickens and ducks freely wandering on the grass around the picnic
tables. No better place on a sunny day to have an organic bottled ale and
chow down fresh fruits of the sea. Cash only and closed on Saturday.

Exploring Ayrshire and Argyll
Just as Sir Walter Scott dominates Lothian and the Borders, the promi-
nence of Robert Burns is felt southwest of Glasgow in Ayrshire. The
heart of “Burns Country” is here, although it extends to Dumfries as 
well (see Chapter 14). Down the Clyde Coast is another popular tourist
attraction: Culzean Castle. Pronounced “cul-lane,” it’s more of a mansion
than a castle and became a favorite of General Eisenhower, who has a
section of the building named after him. This region of Scotland is home
to some of the world’s great links golf courses, including world-famous
Royal Troon and Turnberry, with windswept coastal views and dunes.
At one time, the royal burgh of Ayr was the most popular resort on
Scotland’s West Coast. On the reasonably picturesque Firth of Clyde, it’s
only some 56km (35 miles) southwest of Glasgow — about an hour by
train or by car. For many years it was a busy market town with a more
important and indeed larger port than Glasgow’s until the 18th century.
Ayr offers visitors some 4km (21⁄2 miles) of beach.
Argyll is more remote and wilder, a land of peninsulas and islands with
lots of seas surrounding it. It is a region with several archeological sites,
because this part of Scotland appears to be the spot where the earliest
humans inhabited the land. Although the heydays of resort towns such
as Dunoon on the Cowal Peninsula or Rothesay on the Isle of Bute are
past, they are experiencing a minirevival and remain pleasant places to
visit. Argyll-shire landscape ranges from wooded glens to some rather
craggy peaks, with plenty of shoreline never far away.
The Isle of Arran is sometimes called “Scotland in miniature” because it
combines mountains with more pastoral landscapes. Bute and Gigha
offer smaller island respites, with quiet country lanes and uncrowded
Part IV: The Major Regions 
296

beaches. Islay is Scotland’s whisky island, with several distilleries, but it
is also just a fine place to explore. Parts of Argyll and its towns, such as
Oban or Inveraray, can feel as if they have more in common with the
Highlands and Western Islands. If you can’t fully explore the open spaces
in northern Scotland, Argyll can provide a decent substitute.
The top attractions
Achamore Gardens
Gigha
Towards the southern end of the Isle of Gigha, stately trees begin to dom-
inate the skyline, creating a barrier from the harsher Atlantic sea elements
and providing key protection to this memorable garden. Combining both
walled and parkland plantings, it was started 1944 by Sir James Horlick,
who then owned the entire island. The best time to visit is spring and early
summer to see the exceptional display of the many different species of
azalea, camellia, rhododendron, and other subtropical plants. But, hon-
estly, there is never a bad time to stroll the many paths. Look out for the
blue plumage of the resident peacocks. Allow about two hours.

Brodick Castle
Isle of Arran
This impressive red-sandstone castle once belonged to the dukes of
Hamilton. It sits by the bay, surrounded by acres of park and gardens,
occupying the site of an old Viking fortress. The oldest parts of the build-
ing may date to the 13th century. The stately rooms hold an impressive
collection of silver, porcelain, and paintings. Give yourself time to see the
woodland gardens of exotic flowers. The castle also has an adventure play-
ground, which should please the kids. Allow about two hours.

Burns Cottage and Museum
Alloway
Although perennially underfunded and rather basic, this attraction
remains a must visit for even the casual Burns fan. Visitors can take a self-
guided tour of the cottage, built by William Burnes (as the family name
was originally spelled) in 1757, and kept in the fashion of the poet’s early
childhood. An audio track explains the various uses for the rooms—one of
which held both the family and their livestock. The museum, while rather
modestly housed, is a treasure trove of Burns memorabilia, holding the
best collection of the poet’s manuscripts. The initial room has display

cases with first editions of his books, signed in some instances, as well as
many letters that Burns wrote and received. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

Culzean Castle and Country Park
South Ayrshire
This is a fine example of Adam’s “castellated” style (that is, built with turrets
and ramparts), which replaced an earlier castle keep as the family seat of the
powerful Kennedy clan. After World War II, the castle was given to the
National Trust for Scotland. Notwithstanding its architectural attributes —
whether the celebrated round drawing room or the outstanding oval 
staircase — the pile is of special interest to many Americans because General
Dwight D. Eisenhower was given an apartment for life here. Today, tourists
can rent the six-room top-floor flat as holiday accommodations. Fans of the
Scottish cult horror film, The Wicker Man, should know that scenes at the
home of the devilish character played by Christopher Lee were filmed here
as well. Last entry is one hour before closing. Allow about one hour.

seniors and children, £30 ($56) per family. Apr–Oct daily 10:30 a.m.–5 p.m. 
The property surrounding the castle became Scotland’s first country
park in 1969. The expansive grounds contain a formal walled garden, an
aviary, a swan pond, a camellia house, an orangery, an adventure play-
ground, and a newly restored 19th-century pagoda. Not to mention a
deer park, kilometers and kilometers of woodland paths, and a beach,
too. Unless you’re dead keen on historical houses, the country park is
arguably the real highlight of a trip to Culzean on a fine Ayrshire day.
The views over the sea to the southwest include the rounded rock of an
island called Alisa Craig. Some 16km (10 miles) offshore, it’s a nesting
ground and sanctuary for seabirds. Allow about two hours.

Inveraray Castle
Inveraray
This almost picture-perfect pile with fairy-tale spires sits near Loch Fyne,
just outside the town of Inveraray. Belonging to the clan Campbell, the
castle is still home to the 13th duke and the duchess of Argyll. Highlights
in those wings that tourists can visit include the impressive armory hall,
a fine collection of French tapestries, and the elaborately decorated state
dining room. The grounds are particularly lovely in autumn when the
leaves change color and in spring with the rhododendrons in flower. Allow
at least one hour.

Burns: Humanitarian, poet, skirt chaser
Robert Burns (1759–96) continues to hold a sentimental spot in the national con-
sciousness of Scotland. In recent years, Ayrshire has begun to host an annual music
and cultural festival “Burns an’ a’ that” (www.burnsfestival.com) in the spring
to celebrate his life. Born in Alloway on a night so gusty that part of the cottage came
down, Burns was the son of a simple and pious gardener who encouraged the boy to
read and seek an education. Burns was, by trade, a hard-working though largely
unsuccessful farmer who switched to being a tax collector later in his life.
But the world knows him as the author of poetry, often set to song, such as Auld Lang
Syne, or narrative masterpieces, such as Tam O’Shanter. Other works, such as A Man’s
a Man for a’ That, show Burns’s humanitarian leanings. In his short life, he wrote hun-
dreds of poems and songs. Burns was also a prodigious pursuer of women who fathered
numerous children, legitimate and otherwise. He died at 37 of heart disease in the south-
ern town of Dumfries, distinguished but destitute. Almost immediately, however, contri-
butions to his widow and family were made from across Scotland. Burns was buried
with some ceremony on the very day that his wife Jean delivered their ninth child.

to be a fan of Scotch to enjoy a tour of the distillery. To visit and get a tour
full of good anecdotes and information, you will need to make an appoint-

Mount Stuart
Bute
This mansion belongs to the Marquess of Bute’s family, but it is open to
the public for much of the year. Construction of the red sandstone pile
began around the early 1880s for the third marquess and was still ongo-
ing when he died at the turn of the century. The interiors display certain
eccentricities and interests of the man, such as a ceiling in an upstairs
room that is covered in stars and constellations to accommodate his inter-
est in astrology. The garden dates back to early decades of the 18th cen-
tury, when the second earl of Bute moved the family here from the port
town of Rothesay. The grounds have a woodlands park, a huge walled 
area — the so-called wee garden — and a working vegetable plot, too. The
garden is open from May to mid-October. Allow about two hours.

Arran: Scotland in miniature
The Isle of Arran, in the Firth of Clyde off the coast of Ayrshire, is often called “Scotland
in miniature” because it combines pasture-filled lowlands with mountainous highland
scenery. Indeed, the so-called Highland Boundary Fault Line bisects the island diago-
nally, just as it does the Scottish mainland. In addition to the geographic and topographic
mimicry, Arran offers a castle, half a dozen golf courses (including one with 12 holes),
and a whisky distillery. It’s also a popular camping and cycling destination, with a grow-
ing reputation for producing excellent food, whether harvested from the sea or grown on
the land. The various attractions and activities on Arran range from hiking and rock climb-
ing to horse riding and sailing — plus good stretches of sandy, if windswept, beaches.

up the connections that this part of Scotland had with Norse rulers, and
King Hakon IV in particular. It is worth watching a brief video on the
Scandinavian influences, Norse battles with native Scots and the latter’s
eventual victory over the troops from Norway in the 13th century.
Although mostly a restored ruin, the castle has an impressive pigeon tower
and chapel within the grassy courtyard. If you dare (and you’re thin
enough), you can descend from the Gatehouse into a small dungeon
reserved for prisoners. Allow about one hour.

Formerly called the Oban Seal & Marine Centre, this place offers a hospi-

the marine center has tanks and aquarium emulating the natural habitats
of sea creatures, from crabs to sharks. Other highlights include daily lec-
tures and feedings, as well as a “stud farm” for seahorses as part of a
unique breeding program and a sea otter sanctuary. The setting, among

Golfing heavens: Troon and Turnberry
For links-style golf, which emphasizes sandy dunes and rolling golf
courses, you can hardly do better than the Ayrshire coastline. While
there are a host of options for the avid golfer, the two best-known
courses are Troon and Turnberry.
Chapter 15: Ayrshire and Argyll 301
Bute: The unexplored isle
Officially, Bute considers itself as Scotland’s unexplored isle but it is perhaps better
referred to as the country’s underappreciated island. One of the easiest to reach from the
mainland, Bute offers obvious attractions such as the Mount Stuart mansion and its great
gardens or Rothesay Castle, the circular stronghold at the heart of the island’s main port.
But explore a bit and you will find the reasonably substantial ruins of an ancient Christian
settlement at St. Blane’s Church near the southern tip of the island. Walk out to the sig-
nificantly more meager remains of a chapel dedicated to St. Ninian at St. Ninian’s Point
on the island’s west coast, and you’ll still be treated to the company of dozens of seabirds
along the windswept shoreline. One thing you’ll not have to worry about very much as
you explore the rural roads, however, is the bother of many other tourists.

Troon
The resort town of Troon, 11km (7 miles) north of Ayr and 50km (31
miles) southwest of Glasgow, looks out across the Firth of Clyde toward
the Isle of Arran. Troon takes its name from the curiously hook-shaped
promontory jutting out into the sea: the “trone” or nose. From this port,
a SeaCat ferry (% 08705-523-523; www.steam-packet.com) sails daily
to and from Belfast in Northern Ireland.
Troon and its environs offer several sandy links courses, most promi-
nently the Royal Troon Golf Club, Craigends Road, Troon, Ayrshire
KA10 6EP (% 01292-311-555; www.royaltroon.co.uk). Royal Troon is
a 7,150-yard seaside course that hosts the prestigious Open Champion-
ship, which was last played here in 2004. Hole 8, the famous “Postage
Stamp,” may be only 123 yards in distance, but depending upon the
wind, pros may need a long iron or wedge to reach the green. A second
course, the 6,289-yard Portland is arguably even more challenging.
Visitors, with certificate of handicap (20 for men and 30 for women), can
play the course from May through October on Monday, Tuesday, and
Thursday. The one-day fee to play one round on the Old Course and one
on Portland is £210 ($389), which includes morning coffee and a buffet
lunch. Two rounds on Portland are about half the cost.
A much less expensive but still gratifying alternative to Royal Troon is to
play one of the municipal courses run by the South Ayrshire Council,
such as Darnley or Lochgreen, which runs parallel to Royal Troon at
spots. Fees during the weekend range from £16 to £28 ($30–$52).
Another option is a six-round, seven-day golf pass from the council for
£88 ($163). Log onto www.golfsouthayrshire.com or call the South
Ayrshire Golf hot line at % 01292-616-255.
Nongolfing visitors will find plenty of room to relax on Troon’s 3km (2
miles) of sandy beaches stretching along both sides of the harbor; the

Gigha: The good isle
Pronouned gee-a with a hard “g” (as in gear), this small island off the Kintyre penin-
sula gets its name from the ancient Norse ruler King Hakon who once dominated this
region of Scotland. It’s derived from a Scandinavian word that means the good isle.
And good, indeed, it is. Tiny (only 10km/6 miles long by about 2km/11⁄4 mile wide) and
placid, Gigha is best known for its Achamore Gardens (see earlier), with their excep-
tional springtime display of rhododendrons and azaleas. But as a quiet place to escape
and relax, it is excellent as well. There are plenty of rural and coastal walks, such as
one up the central road. Past an ancient standing stone, it takes you to the Twin
Beaches on a narrow isthmus of dunes linking the island to Eilean Garbh, a bulbous
peninsula with views across to the isles of Islay and Jura. Gigha is also particularly
noteworthy because on March 15, 2002, the residents established a community trust
(www.gigha.org.uk) and assumed ownership of the isle. 

broad sands and shallow waters make it a safe haven for beach bums.
From here you can take boat trips to Arran or the narrow strait north of
Bute known as the Kyles of Bute.
Trains from Glasgow’s Central Station arrive at the Troon station several
times daily (trip time about 40 minutes; £9.50 [$18] for a standard one-
day round-trip ticket). 
Turnberry
The coastal settlement of Turnberry, 81km (50 miles) south of Glasgow
on the A77, was once part of the Culzean Estate. It began to flourish early
in the 20th century when rail service was developed, and a recognized
golfing center with a first-class resort hotel was established. However,
unlike Troon, which is a reasonably sized port town/village, there isn’t
much in Turnberry except for the luxury hotel and golf course.
From the original pair of 13-hole golf courses, the complex has devel-
oped into the two championship level courses, Ailsa and Kintyre, known
worldwide as the Turnberry Hotel Golf Courses. Ailsa’s 18 holes have
been the scene of open tournaments and other professional golfing
events. Guests of the Westin Turnberry hotel get priority access, espe-
cially on the Ailsa course. The fees to play vary. Hotel residents pay
between £45 and £125 ($83–$231) depending on the course and the
season. If you’re not staying at Westin Turnberry, rates range from £60 to
£190 ($111–$352). Log on to www.turnberry.co.uk, or call % 01655-
334-032 for details.
Other cool things to see and do
 Benmore Botanic Garden, 11km (7 miles) north of Dunoon on
Cowal (% 01396-706-261) is part of the national botanic gardens
across Scotland. Rather than formal arrangements and flower beds,
this one specializes in forest planting, including an impressive row
of Pacific redwoods and a cluster of towering monkey puzzle trees.
There is also a good selection of rhododendrons along the miles of
interlacing pathways. Open daily March through October.
 Burns Monument and Gardens, in Alloway about 1km (1⁄2 mile)
from the Burns Cottage, this Grecian-classical monument, which
was replicated in Edinburgh on Calton Hill, was erected in 1823 in a
ceremony attended by the poet’s widow, Jean Armour. The gardens
overlook the River Doon and its famous arching bridge. 
 Inveraray Jail, Church Square, Inveraray (% 01499-302-381). This
is a somewhat implausibly eerie but entertaining museum that takes
on the history of Scottish crime and punishment. Wax figures and
recorded voices attempt to re-create life in the old jail cells. The
murderers and madmen aren’t real, but little ones may find the
prison section more frightening than fun.
Chapter 15: Ayrshire and Argyll 303

 Kilchurn Castle, A85 east of Loch Awe (% 01838-200-440). This
castle offers well-maintained ruins that date to the 16th century.
They’re as much fun to get to as they are to explore — you can
either walk up a steep path from the car park or hop on the steam-
boat ferry for the short ride from the Loch Awe pier.
 McCaig’s Tower, between Duncraggan and Laurel roads in Oban,
was commissioned by a local banker around 1900 in order to
employ three stonemasons who were out of work. Though never
completed, the arches were intended to house statues of his family.
You’re free to walk through the monument and enjoy the city’s best
view of the town.
 Museum of Islay Life, Port Charlotte, Islay (% 01496-850-358).
This little museum is housed in an old church focuses on the his-
tory of the island and island life, as well as the whisky-making
process. It may seem a bit thrown-together, but it will give context
to your visit.
 Caol Ila Distillery, near Port Askaig, Islay (% 01496-302-760). You
may not recognize the name (pronounced cull-ee-la), but this is one
of the most distinguished distilleries on Islay, producing not only
its own sublime brand but also the key component of the Johnnie
Walker blend. The setting along the narrow straight between Islay
and Jura is magical. Open April through October by appointment.
 Souter Johnnie’s Cottage, in Kirkoswald about 19km (13 miles)
south of Ayr, was the home of Burns’s pal, the cobbler (or souter)
named John Davidson. Davidson is name-checked in Burns’s tale of
Tam O’Shanter, who in real life was another friend named Douglas
Graham. The cottage, which dates to 1785, contains Burnsiana,
period furniture, and contemporary cobbler’s tools. In the nearby
kirkyard are the graves of Graham as well as Souter Johnnie and his
wife, Ann. Open April through September.
Part IV: The Major Regions 
304
Islay: Scotland’s whisky island
Sometimes called the Queen of the Hebrides, Islay (pronounced eye-la) is truly
Scotland’s whisky island, with seven full-scale, world renowned distilleries, such as
Ardbeg, Lagavulin, or Bunnahabhain, and also one boutique, microdistillery at
Kilchoman. But there is much more than Scotch to lure you to Islay. Beaches, like the
one at Machir Bay, are breathtaking. Villages such as Port Charlotte or Porthahaven
are charming and placid. You can take sea cruises and look for seals and whales, or
shuck oysters from the farm at Loch Gruinart. On the mull of Oa, the American monu-
ment stands in tribute to the loss of more than 250 navel seamen torpedoed offshore
in World War I. Both Kilchoman and Kildalton offer masterpieces of medieval stone
carving on massive Celtic crosses, befitting the island historical significance at the
center of the ancient Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada.

Shopping for Local Treasures
Ayr and Oban are historic market towns, while smaller villages, such as
Tarbert, have some good craft shops. Many of the attractions listed
above have gift shops. The Burns Museum in Alloway (see the detailed
listing earlier in this chapter) is particularly good for souvenirs about
the Scottish bard. 
 The Celtic House, Shore St. Bowmore, Islay (% 01496-810-304). An
excellent all-round shop with crafts, crystal, gifts, clothes, trinkets,
and an excellent book selection, too. Open Monday through
Saturday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Crafty Kitchen, Ardfern, midway between Oban and Lochgilphead
(% 01852-500-303). Part craft shop and part cafe, the Crafty
Kitchen features works by Scottish artists and craftspeople. The
shop is open April through October, Tuesday through Sunday from
10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
 Earra Gale, the Weighbridge, Tarbert (% 01880-820-428). This
small, harbor-side shop specializes in arts and crafts from all cor-
ners of Argyll, from handmade knitwear to pottery. Open April
through October, including Sunday in mid-Summer, from 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m.
 Islay Woolen Mill, Bridgeend, Islay (% 01496-810-563). This is an
artisanal woolen mill, using fine yarn and making many items that
are a departure from the usual tartans, with rich and earthy colors.
Open Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Mahailia Jewellery Design, 150 Barmore Rd, Tarbert (% 01880-
820-331). Mahailia Scott is a young jewelry designer with an eye for
classy, timelessly modern gold and silver rings, earrings, bracelets,
and more. Her shop is right at the harbor in Tarbert. Open Monday
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Doing the Pub Crawl
Typically, you’ll find no shortage of pubs, especially in the larger towns
of Ayrshire and Argyll. In some of the smaller settlements, the local inn
may be the only place to grab a dram of whisky or a pint. Several of the
hotels (and a couple of the dining options) listed earlier in this chapter
have public house licenses and welcome nonresidents. In addition, con-
sider the following:
 Brodick Bar, Alma Road, Brodick, Arran, opposite the post office
(% 01770-302-169). This all-wood pub pours delicious ale, such as
the island’s own, and has a reputation for serving excellent pub
grub, using Arran lamb and beef or fresh fish. Open Monday
through Saturday from 11 a.m. to midnight.
Chapter 15: Ayrshire and Argyll 305

 Oban Inn, Stafford Street, Oban (% 01631-562-484). This classic
whitewashed pub, near the water just off the town’s main street,
has a warm, old-fashioned elegance. The upstairs bar is a little qui-
eter than downstairs, but the downstairs room, with flags and
exposed wooden beams, is a better place to meet people. Open
daily from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m.
 Rabbie’s Bar, Burns Statue Square, Ayr (% 01292-262-112). The
bar has walls covered with the pithy verses of Robert Burns and
his portrait. However, don’t come here expecting poetry readings
in a quiet corner. The crowd, if not particularly literary, is talkative.
Open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.; on
Sunday, it’s open from noon to midnight.

Fife to the Trossachs
In This Chapter
 Easing your tired feet in cozy hotels
 Dining on local cuisine
 Visiting the stomping grounds of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce
 Enjoying a pint at the best local pubs
T
he area of Central Scotland from Fife to the Trossachs teems with
attractions — and many are within easy reach of Edinburgh and
Glasgow. The region’s flagship settlements are the east coast port of 
St. Andrews in Fife and the historic city of Stirling in the heart of central
Scotland. Other key settlements include Dunfermline, Dunblane, and
Callander.
North of the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh, the region of Fife still likes to
call itself a “kingdom,” a distinction dating to Pictish prehistoric times
when Abernethy was Fife’s capital. Even today, the Kingdom of Fife
evokes romantic episodes and the pageantry of Scottish kings. Indeed,
some 14 of Scotland’s 66 royal burghs lay in this rather self-contained
shire on a broad eastern peninsula between the Forth and Tay rivers. If
you’re at all interested in golf, St. Andrews needs no introduction. Home
to one of the oldest courses in the world — as well as the association
that decides the rules for the sport — St. Andrews, also a college town
with cobblestone streets, is the golf mecca of the world. There are host
of other attractive coastal towns in Fife south and east of St. Andrews in
an area known as East Neuk.
Stirling received royal burgh status from King David in 1124 and was for
a spell the de facto capital of Scotland. Its castle and palace, all largely
intact, became a favorite residence for Scottish royalty during the reign
of the Stuarts. Many people come to see the historic sites of the sur-
rounding area, which has seen its share of battles between Scottish and
the English forces. Both William Wallace, who has a towering monument
in Stirling, and King Robert the Bruce led their armies to decisive victo-
ries in and around Stirling. 
Other things to see and do include visiting Dunfermline Abbey in Fife,
where early Scottish royalty is buried, and the well-preserved ruins of
Doune castle (which Monty Python used in their film The Holy Grail)

near Dunblane. For natural beauty, the Trossach Mountains begin to
approach the majesty of the Highlands, the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park
has plenty of wooded glens, and the banks of Loch Lomond are famously
bonnie in both song and reality.
Getting to Fife and the Trossachs
You don’t necessarily need a car if you’re just going to St. Andrews or
Stirling, because both places are navigable by foot. If your visit to the
regions is a day trip from Edinburgh or Glasgow, for example, consider
taking a train or the bus. Even if you want to see an attraction that lies
outside of the towns, additional trains and buses are available for short
jaunts.
 By car: To get to St. Andrews from Edinburgh, cross the Forth
Bridge and catch the A92 to the A91. From Glasgow to St. Andrews,
take the M80 north towards Stirling, then take the A91. The A91
connects Stirling and St. Andrews. To get to Stirling from Edin-
burgh, take the M9; from Glasgow, take the M80. To get to Callander
and Trossachs, catch the A84 from Stirling. To get to Loch Lomond,
follow the A82 out of Glasgow or the A811 from Stirling.
 By train: To get to Fife from Edinburgh, take the Fife loop, operated
by First ScotRail (% 0845-748-4950; www.firstscotrail.com)
from Haymarket Station. There is no direct train service to St.
Andrews, but there’s a stop some 13km (8 miles) away at the town
of Leuchars. The trip from Edinburgh takes about one hour and
costs around £17 ($31). After you arrive at Leuchars, you can take 
a bus to St. Andrews. 
To get to Stirling, trains depart from Edinburgh Waverley and
Glasgow Queen Street stations. There are no railway lines into the
Trossachs, per se, but you can take the train to Balloch, near Loch
Lomond, from Glasgow.
 By bus: For bus travel schedules, call % 0870-608-2-608. To get to
St. Andrews from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, or Stirling, take
Scottish Fife (% 01334-474-238). The bus ride from Edinburgh to
St. Andrews takes about two hours and costs about £9 ($17) for 
a round-trip ticket. Citylink (% 0990-505-050) buses travel to
Stirling. A typical one-way ticket from Glasgow costs around 
£4.50 ($8.30). 
Spending the Night
Before you pick your accommodations, it’s a good idea to decide what
you want to see and in what order so you don’t find yourself crisscross-
ing the area needlessly. For more accommodation choices than those
listed below, such as smaller B&Bs, consult the tourism board for assis-
tance (% 0845-22-55-121, or log on to visitscotland.com).

Chapter 16: Fife to the Trossachs 309

If you don’t like what you see below, a few of my dining out 
recommendations — Creagan House, the Inn at Kippen, and Monachyle
Mhor, for example — also have overnight rooms. Some of the hotels and
inns I list have earned star ratings from the tourist board (see Chapter 8
for a description of the rating system). Rates below include full break-
fast, unless otherwise stated. And remember: You may well get a better
deal than the advertised “rack” rates.
The Craw’s Nest Hotel
$$–$$$
Anstruther, Fife
Once an old minister’s house, the Nest traded holiness for hospitality
when the building became a fine hotel. It offers a little something for every-
one: A games room for the young and young at heart, four-poster beds for
romantic couples. If you like to boogie, the hotel is also home to the largest
dance floor in the region. If you enjoy a nice view, ask for a room in the
wing overlooking the waters of the Forth and the Isle of May.

312-216. www.crawsnesthotel.co.uk. Rack rates: from £110 ($204) double. AE,
DC, MC, V.
Cromlix House
$$$$
Kinbuck
This accommodation is a sportsman’s dream, drawing fishermen and
hunters with its 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres) of woodlands stretching to
the Allan Water. But Cromlix House is very romantic as well. The three-
story Victorian house is a restored pile that captures the elegance of afflu-
ence in the 19th century; the sitting rooms and guest rooms are decorated
with fine art and period furniture, and common areas such as the library
and conservatory have been restored.

01786-825-450. Rack rates: £240–£280 ($444–$518) double. AE, DC, MC, V. Closed Jan.
De Vere Cameron House
$$$$
Luss
Posh, plush, and perched on the shores of Loch Lomond, the five-star
Cameron House hotel offers premier lodgings. The midrange deluxe rooms
face the water, while the luxury suites are part of the original house and
allow guests to have their meals in the sitting rooms. The fine dining option
is the Georgian Room, which is not deemed suitable for children younger
than 14, and gentlemen are expected to don jackets and ties. Smollets is
the casual option.
See map p. 321. A82 north of Balloch, Dumbartonshire. % 01389-755-565. www.

Drover’s Inn
$
Inverarnan
The stuffed, snarling, and slightly worn animals near the entrance give a
pretty good hint as to the nature of this rustic tavern with restaurant and
overnight rooms. The atmospheric pub usually has an open fire going,
barmen in kilts, and plenty of travelers nursing their drinks. There are 10
overnight units in the original house built in 1705 and another 16 rooms
have been added in a new building.
See map p. 321. A82 at Inverarnan by Ardlui. % 01301-704-234. www.drovers

Gleneagles
$$$$
Auchterarder
Arguably Scotland’s most famous hotel and golf resort, Gleneagles was
purpose built as a swanky inn in 1924 in the style of a French chateau. Who
needs Versailles, when you can have a “Riviera in the Highlands,” as the ini-
tial acclaim raved? There are more than 250 rooms, the best of which are
the specially decorated suites. The Whisky Suites, for example, have sep-

The Inn at Lathones

Near Largoward, Fife
The Inn at Lathones is set in a picturesque spot just 8km (5 miles) from St.
Andrews. It may be 400 years old, but the inn is thoroughly modern, and
the rooms are equipped with stereos and huge bathrooms. The bungalow-
style inn has sidewalks that take you from one whitewashed building to
the next. The main house, with a restaurant and front desk, is a comfort-
able area with fireplaces and sitting rooms. The bar normally stocks a good
selection of Scottish ales and whiskies.

Montague Guest House
$$–$$$
St. Andrews
Nearly every building on Murray Park seems to be a guesthouse or B&B,
but this one has been a standout. Each of the seven comfortable rooms is
nicely appointed and creatively decorated. If you book your stay far
enough in advance, you may be able to get the Ceol-na-Mara (Sound of the
Sea) room, which has a bay window overlooking the water — be sure to
ask if it’s available. Montague House is well located between the old town
area and the beaches.

Old Course Hotel
$$$$
St. Andrews
The Old Course Hotel overlooks the 17th fairway — the infamous “Road
Hole” — of its namesake (to which the hotel has no formal connection).
This is a world-class operation, with price tags to match. The hotel boasts
full spa facilities (for an extra £20/$37 per room), which include a pool with
waterfall. The eating and drinking options encompass the contemporary
Sands seafood bar and restaurant and fine dining at the Road Hole Grill,
where gentlemen are encouraged to wear jackets to dinner, or the Jigger
Inn, a whitewashed traditional pub that serves as the unofficial 19th hole
for the adjacent golf course. Children younger than 12 can stay in parents’
rooms at no extra charge.

The Portcullis
$$
Stirling
This fun little hotel sits in the shadow of Stirling Castle. The rooms are
comfortable but unpretentious, and the staff members are generally
friendly. The Portcullis has been around for hundreds of years and has the
rustic feel of an old coach inn and tavern. The downstairs bar is a plus or
a minus, depending on your point of view — it’s perfect for a nightcap, not
so perfect if you want to be in bed before 10 p.m. An added touch is the
flowers that grow in the lovely walled-in beer garden.

Roman Camp
$$$
Callander
This country house hotel near Roman ruins is one of the more interesting
places to stay in the area. Built in 1625 as a hunting lodge, it became a hotel
in the 1930s, retaining charming low ceilings, creaking corridors, and snug
furniture. The drawing room and conservatory have lovely period furni-
ture and antiques. The River Teith runs through 8 beautiful acres (20
acres) of grounds; you’re welcome to fish in the river, but steer clear of
the grazing sheep and cows.

Smugglers Inn
$$
Anstruther
Back in the day (the building dates to the 14th century), this was apparently
a popular watering hole for smugglers. Although the nine overnight rooms
tend to be small and the floorboards uneven, the classic whitewashed struc-
ture with black trim is quite comfortable and homey. The nautical theme is
a bit kitschy, but don’t worry, matey, it doesn’t extend into the guest rooms.

Stirling Highland Hotel

Stirling
Ever fall asleep in class? Then you’re familiar with the etherlike effect of
school. At the Stirling Highland, an old converted Victorian high school,
you can catch a good night’s sleep or a much-needed nap in the classroom
without facing detention. This well-managed accommodation is in easy
hoofing distance of the castle and Stirling’s Old Town. The leisure room is
quite nice, featuring a pool, steam room, gym equipment, table tennis, and
more. Some family rooms include an adjoining space with bunk beds and
special offer for families includes admission to the castle and Blair

Andrew Fairlie at Gleneagles
$$$$
Auchterarder
FRENCH
This may be the finest dining experience in the country. Fairlie is probably
the most talented chef in Scotland: He not only has prowess in the kitchen,
but he also knows how to bring together a talented team. Dinners here are
seamless but not particularly stuffy affairs. If you have the money, go for
the tasting or degustation menu — it’s six courses of pure delight. Fairlie’s
signature dish is smoked lobster, but other highlights may include foie gras
terrine with apricot and grapefruit chutney or “twice-cooked” Gressingham
duck with oriental watercress salad. In 2006, he received two Michelin stars.

Barnton Bar & Bistro

Stirling
PUB FOOD
The city of Stirling isn’t exactly rich in dining options, but this casual place
is welcoming enough for a coffee, lunch, or an early evening meal. While
there’s nothing particularly outstanding on the menu, the Barnton is a
friendly, welcoming, and relatively inexpensive place in the middle of Stirling
and near the railway station. The premises are a converted pharmacy with
a games room to the rear, usually populated with university students.

SEAFOOD/SCOTTISH
The Cellar is among the best restaurants in the region. Located in an
ancient fishing village and next door to a fisheries museum, the restaurant
is a hot spot for delicacies from the sea. In addition to staples such as crab,
scallops, and lobster, the mostly seafood menu includes dishes such as
crayfish and mussel bisque and monkfish with herb and garlic sauce. The
stone basement dining room is unassuming and comfortable, with can-
dlelight and fireplaces.

Creagan House
$$–$$$
Strathyre
SCOTTISH/FRENCH
Cherry and Gordon Gunn run this charming inn, well-situated for country
walks, in a 17th-century farmhouse with a clutch of rooms. In the evenings,
Gordon repairs to the kitchen where he cooks some sumptuous French-
influenced meals using mostly local ingredients. Especially welcome are
the vegetables, often grown just up the road, which he prepares to accom-
pany the main courses, but these veggies are far from an afterthought.
Don’t be fooled by the baronial-style splendor of the dining room, how-
ever. It’s a much, much more recent addition to the historic house, even
though it looks historic itself. A clutch of rooms, including one that has a
four-poster bed, start at £110 ($204), including full breakfast.

Austria and Scotland. So, will it be jägerschnitzel or roast Barbary duck

can’t beat the location here, just down the road from Stirling Castle.

Kippen
SCOTTISH
About a ten-minute drive west of Stirling on the A811, Kippen is a typical
country village in the rolling hills north of Glasgow. Run by the same folks
who once owned the well-regarded Olivia’s in Stirling, the Inn at Kippen is
a modernized version of the country tavern and small hotel. The ground
floor pub and restaurant specializes in Scottish fare with contemporary
twists. The four overnight rooms, starting at £60 ($111) are clean and
basic.

MODERN SCOTTISH
Just up the highway from Creagan House, here is another gem serving
lunch and dinner in an 18th-century farmhouse. This one overlooks Loch
Voil, down a ramshackle one-lane road from the village of Balquhidder. The
conservatory dining room is modern and so is the cooking. Roast chicken
topped with foie gras, belly of pork served with sage and onion jus, or
seared fish on a bed of shredded celeriac are just some of the typical
options. Dinner is expensive (albeit worth it), though lunches are less
costly. The adjoining lodge has 11 units with their own bathrooms, start-
ing at £95 ($176), which includes breakfast.

changing menus can feature dishes such as seared Isle of Mull scallops,
roast saddle of venison, or roast fillet of Pittenweem cod. Only open for

Exploring Fife to the Trossachs
The highlight of Fife for golfers is St. Andrews, which many consider the
most sacred spot of the sport. But the town, named after the country’s
patron saint, is also of ecclesiastical and scholarly importance. Closer to
Edinburgh, Dunfermline was once the capital of Scotland; its abbey wit-
nessed the births of royalty and contains the burial grounds of several
royals, as well.
Northeast of Glasgow is historic Stirling, with its castle set dramatically
on the hill above the town. During the reign of the Stuart family monarchs
in the 16th century, royalty preferred Stirling over Edinburgh, so it became
the de facto capital of the country. The coronation of Mary Queen of
Scots, only a child at the time, took place in Stirling. High on another hill
north of the city center stands the prominent Wallace Monument, which
is open daily. Nearby, Stirling Bridge is believed to be the crucial site of a
13th-century battle between English invaders and the rag-tag band of
Scots led by William Wallace (forever immortalized — if fictionalized, as
well — in the movie Braveheart). Just outside of the city is another, more
famous battleground: Bannockburn. Somewhere around these fields out-
side of Stirling in 1314, a well-armed English army was nevertheless
routed by Scottish troops led by King Robert the Bruce.
More of a ruin than Stirling Castle, but perhaps more evocative, is Doune
Castle near the town of Dunblane, which has its own attractive and his-
toric cathedral. Further northwest of Stirling are the Trossachs, a moun-
tain range distinct from the Highlands but appealing for its wooded
forests. One key attraction here is Loch Katrine, popularized by Sir
Walter Scott’s poem The Lady of the Lake. Two villages that provide 
gateways to the more mountainous northern regions are Callander and
Aberfoyle. They’re often overrun by the bus tours in the high season
because they offer places to rest, eat, and shop during the day.
Want to save a buck or two? At some attractions, you can pay a single
discounted price for admission to more than one site: St. Andrews 
Castle and St. Andrews Cathedral, for example, or for Stirling Castle 
and Argyll’s Lodging in Stirling.

The top attractions
Andrew Carnegie Birthplace Museum
Dunfermline
In 1835, American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie was
born just down the hill from Dunfermline Abbey. This museum is com-
prised of the 18th-century cottage where he lived as a child and a memo-
rial hall funded by his widow, Louise. Displays tell the story of the weaver’s
son, who emigrated to the United States and became one of the richest
men in the world. A union-busting industrialist, Carnegie nevertheless gave
away hundreds of millions of dollars before his death in 1919. Dunfermline
received the first of the 2,811 free libraries he provided throughout Britain
and America and the town was also bequeathed Pittencrieff Park and Glen.
A statue in the park honors Carnegie, who once worked as a bobbin boy
in a cotton factory. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 309. Moodie Street, Dunfermline. % 01383-723-638. www.carnegie

younger than 15. Open: Apr–Oct Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 2–5 p.m. Closed Nov–Mar.
Argyll Forest Park
Near Loch Lomond
Maintained by the Forestry Commission, the Argyll Forest Park offers some
24,000 hectares (60,000 acres) to explore from forest trails to the “Arrochar
Alps.” If you want some reasonably challenging hill walking and a bit of a
scramble to a rocky perch, try your chances by climbing the Cobbler,
whose craggy peak is hard to miss. The trail begins at the head of Loch
Long just north of the village of Arrochar on the A83. On a clear day, the
view from the summit takes in a good portion of the west coast of Scotland.
The area is home to acres of wildflowers, birds, and even seals in the sea
lochs. For park information and trail maps, visit the Ardgartan Visitor
Center (A83, Loch Long, % 01301-702-432) or log on to www.forestry.
gov.uk. Allow two to five hours.
See map p. 321. Arrochar, off the A83. Admission: free. Open: daily dawn–dusk.
Argyll’s Lodging
Stirling
Sir William Alexander, the founder of Nova Scotia (or “New Scotland”),
built this 17th-century town house, one of Scotland’s finest surviving
Renaissance homes. After being used as a youth hostel in the 20th cen-
tury, the house is today decorated as it would have been in 1680, when the
ninth earl of Argyll lived here. It has been furnished with accurate historic
ornaments and period furniture, plus tapestries, paintings, and even cloth-
ing from the era. Allow about one hour.

Bannockburn Heritage Centre
Near Stirling
The boggy land along Bannock Burn near Stirling was the scene of King
Robert the Bruce’s victory over the English troops of Edward II in 1314.
The decisive win helped to ensure that Scotland kept its independence
from England. The center, run by the National Trust for Scotland, has
exhibits and also screens an audiovisual presentation re-creating the battle
and Bruce’s story. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 321. Glasgow Road, off M80. % 01786-812-664. www.nts.org.uk.
Admission: £5 ($9.25) adults, £4 ($7.40) seniors and children, £14 ($26) family. Open:
Mar–Oct daily 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Deep Sea World
North Queensferry
In the early 1990s, a group of entrepreneurs sealed the edges of an aban-
doned rock quarry under the Forth Rail Bridge, filled it with sea water, and
positioned a 112m (370-ft.) acrylic tunnel on the bottom. Stocked with a
menagerie of sea creatures, it is Scotland’s most comprehensive aquarium.
Now, compared to what you’ll find in cities such as Baltimore or San Diego,
this may seem amateurish. But, from the submerged tunnel, you view kelp
forests; sandy flats that shelter bottom-dwelling schools of stingray,
turbot, and sole; and murky caves favored by conger eels and small sharks.
Curiously, the curvature of the tunnel’s thick clear plastic makes every-
thing seem about 30 percent smaller than it really is. For £145 ($268), you
can also arrange a “shark dive,” however, and see them full size. Allow
about two hours.
See map p. 309. Battery Quarry, North Queensferry. % 01383-411-880. www.deep
seaworld.com. Admission: £8.55 ($16) adults, £6.30 ($12) children, £29 ($54) family
of 4. Open: Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m. 
Doune Castle
Doune
Fans of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail may recognize the exterior
of Doune Castle, seeing as it served as a location for several scenes in the
movie. The castle’s restoration by Historic Scotland has been mostly lim-
ited to making certain the stone structure doesn’t fall down, so visitors
(especially those with good imaginations) actually get a better idea of what
living here in the 14th century may have been like. The castle’s low doors,
narrow spiral stairs, and overall feeling of damp really drive home the
experience of medieval life. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 321. Off the A84 (6.5km/10 miles northwest of Stirling.) % 01786-841-742.

Around Stirling and the Trossachs
Chapter 16: Fife to the Trossachs 321

Dunfermline Abbey and Palace
Dunfermline
The ancient town of Dunfermline, 23km (14 miles) northwest of Edinburgh,
was a place of royal residence as early as the 11th century. The last British
monarch born in Scotland, Charles I, came into the world at Dunfermline.
Its abbey was constructed on the site of a Celtic church and a priory church
built under the auspices of Queen Margaret around 1070. Some 50 years
later work began on a new priory, which can be visited as the Romanesque
“Medieval Nave” today. Abbey status was bestowed in 1150, and thereafter
a string of royalty, beginning with David I, was buried at the abbey, includ-
ing Robert the Bruce. The newer sections of the abbey church were built
in 1818, the pulpit was placed over the tomb and memorial to the Bruce.
The remains of the royal palace are adjacent to the abbey. Only the south-
west wall remains of this once-regal edifice. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 309. St. Margaret’s Street, off the M90. % 01383-739-026. www.
historic-scotland.gov.uk. Admission £3 ($5.55) adults, £2.30 ($4.25) seniors,
£1.30 ($2.40) children. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m.; Oct–Mar daily 9:30
a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Falkland Palace and Garden
Falkland
A rather expensive National Trust attraction to visit, Falkland Palace in
Fife was a royal hunting lodge and country home, constructed for the
Stuart monarchs between 1450 and 1541. Among the rulers who resided
in this impressive specimen of Renaissance architecture were a young
Mary Queen of Scots and her father, James V. The highlights of the palace
are the ornate Chapel Royal, King’s Bedchamber, and Queen’s Room. The
gardens were devised after WWII. Also on the grounds is the royal tennis
court, only one of two to survive since the 1500s. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 309. High Street, just off the M90, at Junction 8. % 01337-857-397.
Admission: £10 ($19) adults; £7 ($13) seniors, students, and children; £25 ($46) family.
Open: Mar–Oct Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 1–5 p.m. Closed Nov–Mar.
Holy Rude Church
Stirling
Among the many interesting aspects of this medieval church — Stirling’s
second oldest building after the nearby castle — are bullet holes made by
Cromwell’s troops in the 17th century. Dating in parts to the middle of the
1400s, the Church of the Holy Rude (or holy cross) is where protestant fire-
brand John Knox preached at the crowing of the one-year-old James VI in
1567. The churchyard and cemetery are worth a walk about for the views
and monuments, including a pyramid shaped one in memory of the
Covenanters, who defended the Presbyterian faith. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 323. St. John Street. % 01786-475-275. Admission: donation requested.
Open: Easter–Sept daily 11 a.m.–4 p.m. Closed Oct–Easter.

Hitting the links in St. Andrews
The medieval royal burgh of St. Andrews in northeast Fife, about 80km (50 miles) from
Edinburgh, was once filled with monasteries and ancient buildings, but only a few
ruins of its early history survive. Once a revered place of Christian pilgrimage, today
the historic town by the sea is best known for golf. It has been played here at least as
early as the 1600s, though some believe much earlier. The rules of the sport are
reviewed, revised, and clarified in St. Andrews by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club,
while its Old Course is perhaps the most famous 18 holes in the world. Golfers consider
this town to be hallowed ground.
St. Andrews has five 18-hole courses (www.standrews.org.uk) and one course
with only 9 holes for beginners and children, all owned by a trust and open to the
public. They are
 Old Course: Where the Open is frequently played and possibly dates to the 15th
century
 New Course: Designed by Old Tom Morris in 1895
 Jubilee Course: Opened in 1897 in honor of Queen Victoria
 Eden Course: Opened in 1914
 Strathtyrum Course: The least difficult 18-holes, designed for those with high or
no handicaps
 Balgove: The 9-hole course designed for beginners and hackers; turn up and play
For the 18-hole courses, except the Old Course, you should try to reserve your tee time
at least one month in advance — except for play at Jubilee, Eden, or Strathtyrum,
which can be reserved 24 hours ahead (if you’re lucky). The reservation office is at 
% 01334-466-666. Online bookings for the New Course, Jubilee, Eden, and Strathtyrum
can be made by logging on to www.linksnet.co.uk.
The Old Course, which hosted the Open in 2005, is a different kettle of fish: First you
need a handicap of 24 for men and 36 for women. You apply in writing one year in
advance and, even then, there are no guarantees. There is a daily ballot or lottery,
which gives out about 50 percent of the tee times for the following day’s play. Apply
in person or by telephone before 2 p.m. on the day before play. By post, send appli-
cations to Reservations Office, Pilmour House, St. Andrews KY16 9SF, Scotland. Single
golfers wishing to play the Old Course should contact the reservations department at
reservations@standrews.org.uk.
Greens fees vary from course to course and depending on the time of year. Generally
speaking, for the 18-hole courses, expect to pay between £16 (Strathtyrum in Mar)
and £125 (Old Course in summer) ($30–$231). From November to March, it costs £61
($113) to play the Old Course, using mats that protect the fairways, and between £12
and £32 ($22–$59) for the other 18-hole courses.
Facilities for golfers in St. Andrews are legion. Virtually every hotel in town provides
assistance to golfers. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club, founded in 1754, remains more

Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery
Kirkcaldy
I think this place, while modest, is a real find. The art collection in the
second floor galleries here is among the single best gathering of works by
Scottish artists. An entire room is devoted to the brightly hued still-life
paintings and landscapes by “Scottish Colourist” S.J. Peploe. There is more
work by Hornel, Hunter, and Fergusson. Another highlight of the collec-
tion is a range of paintings by William McTaggart. In addition, you can com-
pare the abstract beauty of, say, Joan Eardley’s “Breaking Wave” to a
portrait by Scotland’s currently best-selling, if critically panned, contem-
porary painter, Jack Vettriano. No comparison. This unassuming and
humble attraction is arguably the best small provincial art gallery in Great
Britain. What’s more, all they request are donations from visitors. Allow
about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 309. War Memorial Gardens, next to the train station. % 01592-412-860.

Loch Lomond & the Trossachs National Park
West Dumbartonshire
Loch Lomond, the largest inland body of water in all of Great Britain, is
about a 45-minute drive or train ride from the Glasgow city limits. At the
loch’s southern edge, near the otherwise unremarkable if pleasant town
of Balloch, the Lomond Shores development (www.lochlomondshores.
com) was opened in 2002. The complex includes an aquarium, shopping
mall, and the National Park Gateway Centre, which offers information on
the adjacent national park — Scotland’s first — that extends up the east-
ern shores of the loch, comprising some 1,865 sq. km. (720 sq. miles).
If you’re hiking, the trails up the eastern shoreline are preferable. This is
the route that the West Highland Way (see below) follows. If you are a
canoeing or kayaking enthusiast, the Lomond Shores’ visitor center has
rentals (% 01389-602-576; www.canyouexperience.com) for £15 ($28)
per hour. Up the western shores, before the notoriously winding road at
Tarbet, where the train from Glasgow to Oban stops, visitors can take loch
cruises. Golfers will likely be attracted to the Loch Lomond country club,
which hosts the annual Scottish Open professional golf championship,
near the pleasant resort village of Luss.
Chapter 16: Fife to the Trossachs 325
or less rigidly closed as a private-membership men’s club, however. It does tradition-
ally open the doors to the public on St. Andrews Day to view the trophy room. This
usually falls on November 30.
If you’re looking for more golf-related information, try the tourist office in St. Andrews
at 70 Market St. (% 01334-472-021). It’s open year-round Monday through Saturday
and on Sunday, too, during the high season. Call for hours.

See map p. 321. National Park Gateway Centre, Lomond Shores, Balloch. % 01389-
722-199. Open: daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Queen Elizabeth Forest Park
Stirlingshire
East of Loch Lomond, the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park has thousands of
acres of unspoiled nature. Many trails wind through the woods and hills of
the region, managed by the Forestry Commission. The visitor center (with
information and maps) at the David Marshall Lodge near Aberfoyle is a
good base for hiking excursions. If nature walks aren’t your thing, how-
ever, there are good picnic spots — or you can motor through a part of
the park on the scenic Achray Forest Drive (A821). Allow two to four hours.
See map p. 321. David Marshall Lodge, off the A821. % 01877-382-258. www.
forestry.gov.uk. Admission: free. Open: park daily dawn–dusk; visitor center
daily 11 a.m.–4 p.m.
St. Andrews Cathedral
St. Andrews
Near the Celtic Church of Blessed Mary on the Rock, by the sea at the east
end of town, is St. Andrews Cathedral. Once the largest church in Scotland,
it was founded in 1161. The cathedral certified the town as the ecclesias-
tical capital of the country, but the ruins can only suggest its former
beauty and importance. There’s a collection of early Christian and
medieval monuments, as well as artifacts discovered on the cathedral site.
Admission allows entry to nearby St. Andrews Castle, where the medieval
clergy lived. Allow about two hours.
Part IV: The Major Regions 
326
Hiking the West Highland Way
One of Scotland’s best-known long-distance footpaths is the West Highland Way,
established in the 1980s. The trail begins rather uneventfully northwest of Glasgow in
the affluent suburb of Milngavie (pronounced mill-guy). But as the trail winds some
153km (95 miles) north along the eastern shore of Loch Lomond, through the desolate
and almost prehistoric looking Rannoch Moor, along the breathtaking and historic Glen
Coe, and ending finally in Fort William, it just gets better and better. At the northern
terminus, you’re at the foot of Ben Nevis, Scotland’s highest mountain.
Trains run frequently throughout the day from the Queen’s Street railway station in cen-
tral Glasgow to Milngavie, the starting point of the walk. The 25-minute trip costs £2.35
($4.35) one-way. In Fort William, you can catch the First ScotRail train back to Glasgow.
Hikers can backpack and camp along the way or stay at inns conveniently dotted along
the trail. Tour companies are available to haul your luggage from stop to stop along the
way. For details on the West Highland Way, contact the National Park Gateway Centre,
% 01389-722-199 — or log onto www.west-highland-way.co.uk.

children. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
SS Sir Walter Scott Steamship
Loch Katrine
For more than 100 years, this old-fashioned ship has taken passengers out
on Loch Katrine to marvel at the beauty of the Trossachs. A bit of floating
history, the ship is the last screw-driven steamship regularly sailing with
passengers in Scotland. It runs between the Trossachs Pier and Stron-
achlachar and passes an eyeful of stunning views along the way. The ship
is named after the renowned author who made Loch Katrine famous in his
poem The Lady of the Lake. Be warned, however: This popular trip can get
overcrowded in the summer, so if you can, go on a weekday. Allow about
four hours.
See map p. 321. Loch Katrine, Trossachs. % 01877-376-316. Admission: £7.50 ($14)
adults, £4.50 ($8.30) children. Departures: Apr–Oct (weather permitting) daily 10:30 a.m.,
1:15, 2:30, and 5 p.m. (and 3:45 p.m. on selected weekdays). No sailings Tues–Wed in
Oct. or between Nov–Mar.
Stirling Castle
Stirling
Once the residence of Scotland’s royalty, this striking Renaissance castle
was home to Mary Queen of Scots, her son James VI of Scotland (and later
James I of England), and other Stuart monarchs. A natural fortress, the
castle on a hill was the region’s strategic military point throughout much
of the 13th and 14th centuries. Even if you don’t bother taking a tour of
the impressive castle (though you should), the ramparts and grounds sur-
rounding the well-fortified landmark are worth a stroll — particularly the
cemetery and the “Back Walk” along a wall that protected the Old Town
from attack. In the castle proper, you can see both a palace built by James
V and the Chapel Royal, which was remodeled by his grandson, James VI.
Recently restored, the castle’s Great Hall is visible for miles thanks to the
Chapter 16: Fife to the Trossachs 327
Culross: Stepping back in time
Thanks largely to the National Trust for Scotland, this town near Dunfermline shows
what a Scottish village from the 16th to 18th century was like. With its cobbled streets
lined by stout cottages featuring crow-stepped gables, Culross may also have been the
birthplace of St. Mungo, who went on to establish the Glasgow Cathedral. James IV
made this port on the Firth of Forth a royal burgh in 1588. The National Trust runs a vis-
itor center (% 01383-880-359; www.nts.org.uk) that is open daily noon to 5 p.m.
from Good Friday to the end of September, which provides access to the town’s palace
and other sites. Adult admission is £8 ($15).

creamy, almost yellow exterior that apparently replicates its original color.
Allow about three hours.
See map p. 323. Castle Wynd. % 01786-450-000. www.historic-scotland.
gov.uk. Admission: £8.50 ($16) adults, £6.50 ($12) seniors, £3.50 ($6.50) children.
Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m.; Oct–Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–4:15 p.m.
Stirling Old Town Jail
Stirling
For some of the tours, guides donning period dress take groups through
the paces of penal life here, while others role-play as wardens and inmates
to help enact the history of the jail. This building is a Victorian replace-
ment for the rather less humane cells in the old tollbooth across the street.
Still, when you see the crank that inmates were made to turn as punish-
ment, one wonders if prison existence had improved all that much. On the
top of the building, an observation deck offers good views of the sur-
rounding Old Town. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 323. St. John Street. % 01786-450-050. www.instirling.com/
sight/jail.htm. Admission: £5 ($9.25) adults; £3.75 ($6.95) seniors, students, and
children; £13 ($24) family. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m.; Oct and Mar daily
9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Nov–Feb daily 10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
University of St. Andrews
St. Andrews
This is the oldest university in Scotland and the third oldest in Britain after
Oxford and Cambridge. Of its famous students, the most recent graduate
was Prince William, heir to the throne after Charles. At term time, you can
see packs of students in their characteristic red gowns. The university
spreads throughout the town today, but the original site was centered in
the districts just west of the Cathedral. The gate tower of St. Salvador
College on North Street dates to the 15th century.
See map p. 319. www.st-andrews.ac.uk.
More cool things to see and do
 British Golf Museum, Bruce Embankment, St. Andrews (% 01334-
478-880; www.britishgolfmuseum.co.uk). This museum is
devoted to the history and popularity of the game. Exhibits reveal
the evolution of equipment and rules and remarkable facts and
feats of the last 500 years. 
 Byre Theatre, Abbey Street, St. Andrews (% 01334-475-000; www.
byretheatre.com). This theater is the cultural center of St.
Andrews; it features dramatic performances ranging from
Shakespeare to musical comedies.
 Holy Trinity Church, off South Street, St. Andrews (% 01334-
474-494; www.holytrinitystandrews.co.uk). This medieval
church was re-created at the beginning of the 20th century around
Part IV: The Major Regions 
328

the impressive tower, which does actually date to the 1400s. In the
original church, John Knox advised the congregation in June 1559
to cleanse the temple and remove all the Catholic monuments to
idolatry. In that single day, apparently, the reformation took root in
this parish. 
 The National Wallace Monument, Alloa Road, Abbey Craig, Stirling
(% 01786-47-2140; www.nationalwallacemonument.com). If you
travel anywhere near Stirling, you’re likely to see this 66m (220-ft.)
tower set on top of a hill overlooking the surrounding terrain. Built
in the 1860s, the monument’s popularity soared after the release of
Braveheart, Mel Gibson’s hit 1995 movie depicting William Wallace’s
life. A shuttle bus runs between a visitor center and the monument. 
 Rob Roy and the Trossachs Visitor Centre, Callander (% 01877-
330-342; www.robroyvisitorcentre.com). This museum in the
Trossachs region, home of the Clan MacGregor, offers two versions
of Rob Roy MacGregor: the tartan Robin Hood and legendary figure
of Sir Walter Scott’s novel or just cattle thief and blackmailer.
Whatever the specifics, Rob Roy was certainly a hero to his people
and an outlaw in defiance of the English. 
 Secret Bunker, Troywood, south of St. Andrews (% 01333-310-
301; www.secretbunker.co.uk). This bunker is the former under-
ground nuclear command center where U.K. leaders would have
found refuge in the event of a nuclear war. Kept from public knowl-
edge for decades, the facility was declassified in the 1990s, and you
can now see this Cold War relic.
Shopping for Local Treasures
Shopping in Stirling and St. Andrews is typical of provincial towns and
cities around Scotland, with the former offering the dubious bonus of a
shopping mall called the Thistle Centre (near the train station). This
area also introduces tourists to another questionable shopping attrac-
tion in Scotland: Highland gateway towns. Both Aberfoyle and Callander
fit this bill — one-street burghs cluttered with lots of tartan and woolen
shops that attract coach tours, causing the sidewalks to occasionally
overflow with tourists on summer days. The road that runs along Loch
Lomond, the A82, has a few galleries with art. Remember, as I have said
in previous chapters, most attractions have decent shops for gifts, sou-
venirs, and even local crafts, on occasion. Below are a few suggestions
for shops that are a cut above.
 Jim Farmer Golf Shop, 1 St. Mary’s Place, Market Street, St.
Andrews (% 01334-476-796). Heads up, golfers. Need a new pitch-
ing wedge or just a fancy set of club warmers? This shop will take
care of you and maybe even help trim a stroke or two off your
handicap. Shirts, hats, T-shirts, shoes, and more are on hand. Call
for hours.
Chapter 16: Fife to the Trossachs 329

 The Fotheringham Gallery, Henderson Street, Bridge of Allan 
(% 01786-832-861; www.fotheringham-gallery.co.uk). This
contemporary art gallery and shop has handmade designer jew-
elry, glass works, sculpture, and paintings — all by contemporary
Scottish artists and craftsmen. Open Monday through Saturday 10
a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
 The Green Gallery, Main Street, Aberfoyle (% 01877-382-873;
www.greengallery.com) is a standout in this Highland gateway
town because of its eclectic collection of contemporary arts and
crafts on exhibit, and for sale, of course. Every month seems to
focus on a new set of works. Open Thursday through Saturday 
and Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday noon to 5 p.m.
Wednesday by appointment only.
 The Scottish Wool Centre, off Main Street, Aberfoyle (% 01877-
382-850), is an attraction as well as a shop; this is one store where
the kids shouldn’t get bored. Besides exhibits that show everything
you want to know about Scottish wool and more, the Spinner’s
Cottage gives you a chance to make your own wool. There are
sheepdog demonstrations and a children’s farm (admission
charged). Open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Doing the Pub Crawl
If you’re staying in Stirling or St. Andrews, check out these two watering
holes, which are a notch or two above the norm. Otherwise, practically
every village and town in the region has a pub, or stick to the local
hotels and inns.
 Central Bar, corner of Market and College streets, St. Andrews 
(% 01334-478-296). If you’re looking for a quintessential pub, this
is a fine one, popular with students and offering a good selection of
draft beers, including “guest” ales. Open Monday through Saturday
11 a.m. to 11:45 p.m., and Sunday from 12:30 p.m.
 Whistlebinkies, 73–75 St. Mary’s Wynd, Stirling (% 01786-451-256).
The name sounds like a place for kids, and young patrons are
indeed welcome here and even get their own kid’s menu. But adults
will appreciate the comfortable booths and selection of good beers
and whiskies as well. The fireplace and stained-glass windows are
nice touches. The building, just down the hill from the Castle, dates
to 1595 and originally housed the castle’s blacksmith. Open daily
noon to midnight.

Chapter 17
Tayside and the Northeast
In This Chapter
 Finding the right place to stay and dine
 Touring a castle or two
 Enjoying a dram of whisky at a Speyside distillery
T
his chapter covers a fairly large chunk of northern Scotland: From
Dundee and Perth on the River Tay up to the oil-boom city of Aber-
deen, and the eastern Moray coast. Here you will find several castles on
the eastern fringes of the Grampian Mountains — including Balmoral (the
official royal family retreat) — and a host of whisky distilleries. Yes, the
ride up the highway (A93) to Braemar can be pretty spectacular. But
compared to the Highlands (see Chapter 18), which encroaches on this
region from the west, I just can’t get as excited about the countryside
stretching from Tayside to the Northeast and port towns such as
Fraserburgh or Peterhead. 
I’ve kept this chapter succinct, and I suggest that if you head in this
direction, you should concentrate briefly on a couple of towns, such as
Perth or Pitlochry. You can trek through Royal Deeside, visit a few cas-
tles, and finally hit a distillery or two near the River Spey.
There are two bona fide cities in this region: Dundee and Aberdeen. The
latter is known as the Granite City, because many of the city center
buildings are made from the same sturdy if somewhat dull grey stone.
Aberdeen is also Scotland’s natural gas capital, the place where the oil
industry, tapping petroleum reserves way out in the North Sea, has their
mainland operations. The city has plenty of bars and restaurants but is
rather short on attractions, if you ask me. 
Perth is a rather attractive town situated on the River Tay between two
large parks, North and South Inch. A royal burgh since the 1200s, Perth
has a couple of fine restaurants and lies near one of Scotland’s most his-
toric attractions: Scone Palace. Pitlochry is one of the most visited
inland resort towns in Scotland, mainly because it’s on a main artery
(the A9) leading up to Inverness and the Highlands. 

Getting There
Getting to and around this part of Scotland isn’t quite as easy as it is in
other parts of the country. Trains run to Perth, Dundee, and Aberdeen,
but the branch system isn’t well developed. Bus service to the larger
towns is reasonable, but in the end, you’re likely to want a car to see the
main attractions.
 By car: From Edinburgh, take the M90 north to Perth, where you
have the option of using the A90 along the east coast to Aberdeen,
the A9 inland through Pitlochry, or the narrower A93 via Braemar.
From Glasgow, use the M80 (A80) to the M9 (A9), which takes you
to Perth. 
The scenic route is A93, which goes past Braemar, Ballater, and
Banchory on its way to Aberdeen.
 By bus: Scottish Citylink (% 0870-550-5050; www.citylink.
co.uk) routes cover the two cities and major towns. A typical bus
round-trip bus fare from Edinburgh to Aberdeen is about £30 ($56)
and the journey takes about four hours. A trip from Glasgow to
Perth costs around £12 ($22) and takes approximately 11⁄2 hours.
 By train: First ScotRail (% 08457-48-49-50; www.firstscotrail.
com) travels to cities and major towns in the region, including
Perth, Pitlochry, Dundee, Arbroath, and Aberdeen. You’ll then have
to rely on buses or local taxis to venture further after you arrive in
these towns. ScotRail service dovetails with long-distance trains
from England, which are run by Great North Eastern Railway
(% 08457-225-225) and Virgin Trains (% 0870-789-1234). You 
can also call National Railway Enquiries at the First ScotRail phone
number above for details. Just to give you an idea of prices: A stan-
dard round-trip ticket from Glasgow to Aberdeen costs around £60
($110). The trip takes at least 21⁄2 hours.
 By ferry: NorthLink Orkney & Shetland Ferries Ltd. (% 01855-
851-144) runs services between Aberdeen and Lerwick.
 By plane: The Aberdeen Airport (% 01224-722-331) is 9.5km (6
miles) north of town. Planes connect Aberdeen to Glasgow, Edin-
burgh, Dundee, and the Shetland and Orkney Islands. A typical
flight on British Airways from London to Aberdeen costs between
£80 and £250 ($148–$463) for a round-trip ticket. The Dundee
Airport (% 01382-643-242) is on Riverside Drive; it has service 
to Aberdeen and Edinburgh.
Spending the Night
Because it’s a fairly large area, you should choose accommodations
nearest to the attractions you want to see. Some of the hotels and guest-
houses listed here have earned star ratings from the tourist board; see
Chapter 17: Tayside and the Northeast 333

Chapter 8 for a description of the rating system. Rates include full break-
fast unless otherwise stated. And remember: You may well get a better
deal than the advertised “rack” rates.
Braemar Lodge Hotel
$$
Braemar
This homey, granite country house — a renovated Victorian hunting 
lodge — offers unpretentious, comfortable accommodations. If the hotel
is small, the rooms are reasonably spacious and most have views of the
mountains. At the oak-paneled bar, guests can sip a whisky nightcap in
front of a log fire. If the Victorian shooting lodge isn’t down-home enough
for you, log cabins with kitchens are also available for rent by the week.
See map p. 335. 6 Glenshee Rd. % 013397-41627. www.braemarlodge.co.uk.
Rack rates: £70 ($130) double. MC, V.
Craigellachie Hotel
$$$
Speyside
As it is close to a clutch of whisky distilleries, including the Glenfiddich,
this charming and hospitable four-star hotel is perhaps best known for its
Quaich Bar. It is virtually a library of single malt whiskies, with some 700
bottles lining the shelves around the entire room. Find the one you prefer
and the bartender will pour you a dram. Since 1893, the hotel has served
as a welcome retreat in the heart of rural Speyside. Bedrooms and public
lounges are comfortable and well furnished, while the restaurant is accom-
plished, too. By the way, it is pronounced roughly kray-gell-ah-key.
See map p. 335. Off the A93, Craigellachie (3km/2 miles northwest of Dufftown).

Darroch Learg
$$$
Ballater
Set on a wooded hillside overlooking the road and the River Dee beyond,
this is one of the more highly regarded hotels in the entire region. Stately
but friendly, with an excellent reputation for food, Darroch Learg is my
choice if you’re spending a night near the royal spread in Balmoral. A
dozen overnight rooms in the main lodge are complemented with five
more in a nearby annex. All are well appointed and comfortable.

55443. Fax: 013397-55252. www.darrochlearg.co.uk. Rack rates: £130–£160

Fasganeoin Country House
$$
Pitlochry
Just off the main drag, this house hotel is a few minutes’ walk from
Pitlochry town center or a riverside stroll to the Festival Theatre. The
rooms (not all en suite) are comfy and cute, featuring a flower and antique
motif, and some rooms have cozy sunken floors. The peaceful grounds
offer a lovely respite. For the price, it’s hard to beat Fasganeoin (pro-
nounced faze-gan-non, it means “place for the birds” in Gaelic).
See map p. 335. Perth Road, opposite the Blair Atholl Distillery. % 01796-472-387.
Fax: 01796-474-285. www.fasganeoincountryhouse.co.uk. Rack rates:
£64–£76 ($118–$141) double with private bathroom. MC, V. Open mid-Mar to Oct.
Macdonald’s Restaurant & Guest House
$
Pitlochry 
This popular inn and dining room on the main drag through Pitlochry has
a loyal following. And why not? The rooms (refurb’ed in 2005) are nicely
decorated and the hospitality is generous. But more importantly, you
would be very hard-pressed to beat the price these days. In addition to
the restaurant, the premises also have a well-regarded fish and chip cafe.

The Marcliffe Hotel and Spa
$$$–$$$$
Aberdeen
This hotel, also known as Marcliffe at Pitfodels, is perhaps the best place
to stay in Aberdeen. It’s certainly often recommended, probably because
the Marcliffe combines high-class five-star accommodation with intimate
attention. The family-run, three-story hotel sits among trees and has a
country feel despite its proximity to the city. All of the individually deco-
rated rooms are comfortable and spacious, the beds huge, and the antique
furniture in good taste. Mikhail Gorbachev officially opened the place as a
guest in 1993, and if it’s good enough for the father of glasnost, it should be
good enough for you.
See map p. 335. North Deeside Road, off the A92. % 01224-861-000. Fax: 01224-868-
860. www.marcliffe.com. Rack rates: £155–£185 ($287–$342) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Parklands Hotel
$$–$$$
Perth
This four-star small hotel occupies a stylish Georgian townhouse once
owned by a lord provost (mayor). Overlooking the woods of South Inch
Park and near the railroad station, the Parklands is a peaceful oasis in a
bustling little town. The spacious rooms are nicely decorated and recently
this became the first hotel in Perth to offer wireless broadband (Wi-Fi).
There are two restaurants, either the Acanthus or the less formal No. 1
the Bank.

Salutation Hotel
$$
Perth
It’s right on the main street of Perth, but the Salutation is a quiet haven of
big beds and friendly service. After you’ve walked all over town and had
your dinner, relax with a nightcap in the huge overstuffed couches by the
fire in the lobby. It’s no wonder the staff has its act together — the hotel
has been welcoming guests since 1699, making it one of the oldest in
Scotland.

Your best option in the area may be right in your own hotel, but here are
a few other places to consider.
Jute 
$–$$
Dundee
INTERNATIONAL
This pleasant cafe/bar is part of the Dundee Contemporary Arts complex
in the so-called cultural quarter of the city, and it’s one of the highlights of
the city. After the restaurant closes for the night, it’s a lively bar and one
of the places to be seen in Dundee. The food here is as imaginative and as
modern as the décor.
See map p. 335. 152 Nethergate. % 01382-909-246. www.dca.org.uk. Reservations
not required. Main courses: £8–£15 ($15–$28). MC, V. Open: daily 10:30 a.m.–midnight
(from noon on Sun).
Deans @ Let’s Eat
$$–$$$
Perth
SCOTTISH/FRENCH
In 2005, chef Willie Deans took over ownership from Tony Heath and put
his stamp on the restaurant formerly known as simply Let’s Eat. Deans is
a member of the Master Chefs of Great Britain, and his cooking usually has
its share of flourishes. A typical menu will have two beef, two fish, and two
poultry main courses and one vegetarian main course, with dishes such as
free-range chicken supreme wrapped in parmesan pasta with a concasse
of tomatoes and basil.
See map p. 335. 77–79 Kinnoull St. % 01738-643-377. Reservations recommended. Main
courses: £11–£19 ($20–$35). MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat noon–2 p.m. and 6:30–9:45 p.m.

Port-Na-Craig Inn
$$–$$$
Pitlochry
SCOTTISH/SEAFOOD
A few years back, this place captured the attention of the Michelin inspec-
tors, who bestowed their award for good food at reasonable prices. Since
then, those proprietors have sold up and moved on, but current manage-
ment (who operate the Strathgarry restaurant in town) has ambitions to
ensure this restaurant near the Festival Theatre remains the place to eat
in Pitlochry. Typical dishes include loin of venison with pearl barley risotto
or grilled organic salmon.
See map p. 335. Off Foss Road. % 01796-472-777. www.portnacraig.com. Reser-
vations recommended. Main courses: £8–£18 ($15–$33). MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat
12:30–2 p.m. and 6–9 p.m., Sun 1–2:30 p.m. Closed Dec 25 to mid-Mar.
Silver Darling
$$$–$$$$
Aberdeen
SEAFOOD
Getting to this restaurant at the water’s edge is a bit of an odyssey, but it’s
worth it. In the dining room overlooking the entrance to the harbor, you
find succulent dishes such as roast filet of turbot with nut crust or steamed
halibut with a lobster and scallop mousse. The menu is pricey, but from
the rooftop views overlooking the sea to some of the highest-quality food
in the area, Silver Darling is worth the extra dough.
See map p. 335. Pocra Quay, North Pier. Follow the road from Aberdeen harbor along
the water until you reach the beach, turn right. % 01224-576-229. Reservations

$$–$$$
Perth
MODERN SCOTTISH
This restaurant, run by Jeremy and Shona Wares, rivals the better-known
Let’s Eat (see listing above) for good eating in Perth. The bright, white-
washed, and contemporary dining space overlooks the River Tay, and
dishes include main courses such as milk-poached smoked Shetland had-
dock with caramelized spinach. Lunches are a good value for two courses
at around £14 ($27).
See map p. 335. 63 Tay St. % 01738-441-451. www.63taystreet.com. Reser-
vations recommended. Two courses prix fixe: £22 ($43). AE, MC, V. Open: Tues–Sat
noon–2 p.m. and 6:30–9 p.m.
Exploring Tayside and the Northeast
The territory from Tayside to the Northeast offers a host of scenic
drives and historical castles and palaces. Tayside, carved out of the old
counties of Perth and Angus, is named for its major river, the 192km-long
(119-mile) Tay. The river’s waters offer some of Europe’s best salmon
and trout fishing, although many say it’s not as good as it used to be. As
Part IV: The Major Regions 
338

you journey into Scotland’s Northeast, you pass moorland and peaty
lochs, wood glens and rushing rivers, granite-stone villages and ancient
edifices.
A “Scotland’s Treasures” joint ticket offers admission to Blair Castle,
Scone Palace, Glamis Castle, and more at significantly reduced prices.
Tickets are sold at Blair, Glamis, and Scone visitor centers.
The top attractions
Balmoral Estate
Ballater
Welcome to the vacation home of Queen Elizabeth and the Windsors.
Because Balmoral is a working residence for the royal family, visitor access
is limited to the ballroom, garden, and grounds. On display are pictures of
rooms as well as clothing and gifts belonging to the family. You’re free to
walk the extensive grounds and gardens. Because the castle is closed to
tourists when the Queen is in town, it’s a good idea to call in advance of
your visit. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 335. Balmoral, Ballater, off the A93 (13km/8 miles from Banchory). 
% 01339-742-334. www.balmoralcastle.com. Admission: £7 ($13) adults, £6
($11) seniors and students, £3 ($5.55) children younger than 16. Open: Apr–July daily
10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Wed Nov to mid-Dec for guided tours. Closed Aug–Apr.
Blair Castle
Blair Atholl
This fine, fairy-tale-white castle up the road from Pitlochry has much to
see. It’s chock-full o’ stuff: art, armor, flags, stag horns, and more items not
typically found on the standard furniture-and-portrait castle tour. Between
the 30 rooms and the grounds (including a walled garden), the castle has
something (such as pony trekking) for just about everyone. The most
common theme in the Duke of Atholl’s decorating is hunting. Deer antlers
decorate the long hallway and ballroom, and the weaponry collection
spans hundreds of years. Blair Castle’s long history includes a couple of
Jacobite sieges and a sleepover by Queen Victoria. But while the castle is
the ancient seat of the dukes and earls of Atholl, and although Duncan
Atholl was the king murdered in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the real Duncan
didn’t live here. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 335. Blair Atholl, off the A9 (10km/6 miles west of Pitlochry). % 01796-

Drum Castle and Gardens
Banchory
The family seat of the Irwins of Drum since the times of Robert the Bruce,
this is the oldest intact building in the care of the National Trust for
Scotland. Built at different times, it has a medieval tower, Jacobean man-
sion, and Victorian additions. Nothing in particular in the Irvine family col-
lection is remarkable, but you’re likely to enjoy the walk through the
house, which includes an impressive vaulted library in the oldest section
of the castle. Don’t miss the grounds and gardens, a highlight of which is
a collection of historic roses. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 335. Drumoak, off the A93 near Peterculter (16km/10 miles west of
Aberdeen. % 01330-811-204. www.drum-castle.org.uk. Admission: £8 ($15)
adults; £5.25 ($9.70) seniors, students, and children younger than 16; £20 ($38) family.
Open: Easter–Sept daily except Tues and Fri noon–5 p.m. Closed Oct–Easter.
Edradour Distillery
Pitlochry
You get a good primer on the whisky-making process at this distillery, one
of Scotland’s smallest, which produces only 12 casks of whisky a week that
are matured for ten years before bottling. It’s a cute site, too, with little
white-washed buildings with red doors and friendly staff using the small-
est size spirit stills that the law allows. Of course, it’s quality, not quantity
that counts. The tours and a wee dram of whisky are free. Allow about 11⁄2
hours.
See map p. 335. Off the A924, just outside Pitlochry. %01796-472-095. www.edradour.
co.uk. Admission: free. Open: Mar–Oct Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun noon–4 p.m.,
Nov–Feb Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m., Sun noon–4 p.m.
Glenfiddich Distillery
Near Dufftown
In contrast to Edradour, Glenfiddich is one of the largest distilleries in
Scotland, owned by William Grant & Sons, a family who has been making
the national spirit since 1887. The tour starts with a video explaining the ins
and outs of whisky-making, before seeing the mash-tuns and huge 5-m-tall
(1.5-ft.) wash-backs made of Douglas fir, the expansive bonded warehouses,

Braemar Highland gathering
The average population of the village of Braemar is around 500 people. But when the
village holds the Braemar Highland Games (% 01339-741-944) every September, the
population jumps by 20,000 or more, and that includes Queen Elizabeth, who usually
attends. This purely Scottish experience of feats of strength and traditional dance is
a lot of fun for outsiders, as well. Plenty of crafts and food abound. 

and finally the bottling factory. In addition to the standard tour, the
“Connoisseur’s Tour” is a 21⁄2 hour exploration of the distillery that con-
cludes with a tutored nosing and tasting session (£15/$28). The shop sells
a host of popular and extremely rare vintage single malts.
See map p. 335. Off the A941 (88km/55miles northeast of Aberdeen). % 01340-820-
373. http://distillery.glenfiddich-whisky.co.uk. Admission: Free.
Open: Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sun noon–4:30 p.m.
If you are truly keen on whisky, you can follow Scotland’s Malt Whisky
Trail throughout this region, visiting several distilleries, just as you
might tour the chateaux of Bordeaux or wineries in the Napa Valley. For
more information on itineraries, log on to www.maltwhiskytrail.com.
Pitlochry Festival Theatre
Pitlochry
This arts center on the south side of the River Tummel is the jewel of
Pitlochry. People come here from throughout the region for a bit of cul-
ture. In addition to new and classic dramatic performances or exhibitions
at the center’s art gallery, the Festival Theatre also offers a busy schedule
of folk concerts, literary talks, and even culinary events. It’s best to book
tickets in advance.
See map p. 335. Across the river from Main Street. % 01796-484-626. www.
pitlochry.org.uk. Theater tickets: £15–£22 ($28–$41).
Scone Palace
Near Perth
Scone (pronounced scoon) is the first established capital of a unified
Scotland, the hallowed ground where most of the country’s early kings
were enthroned and latter ones, up to Charles II, were crowned. For years
it held the infamous Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone (see story below).
The castellated Scone Palace you will find today, however, only dates to
the early 1800s, though parts of earlier buildings have been incorporated.
Home to the earls of Mansfield, it is full of fine furniture, ivories, clocks,
and needlework, and of particular note is the renowned porcelain collec-
tion. There is also a hall dedicated to the coronation of kings. The grounds
are also quite nice. A replica Stone of Scone marks the location of its his-
torical spot on Moot Hill by a little chapel. Allow two hours.
See map p. 335. Braemar Road, on the A93. % 01738-552-300. www.scone-palace.
net. Admission: palace and grounds £7.20 ($13) adults, £6.20 ($11) seniors and stu-
dents, £4.20 ($7.80) children younger than 16, £23 ($43) family. Open: late Mar–Oct
daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m. Closed Nov to mid-Mar.

Other cool things to see and do
 Auchingarrich Wildlife Centre, on the B827 near Comrie (% 01764-
679-469; www.auchingarrich.co.uk), offers a host of wild and
domesticated animals (from lambs to emus), a wild-bird hatchery,
and hiking trails. Younger children can burn off some steam at the
facilities “adventure” playground.
 Barrie’s Birthplace, Brechin Road, Kirriemuir (% 01575-572-646).
This museum is devoted to the creator of Peter Pan, J.M. Barrie,
who was born here in 1860. Watch for the little fast-moving light
that represents everyone’s favorite fairy, Tinkerbell. The museum
also contains manuscripts and artifacts from the writer’s life.
 Discovery Point, Discovery Quay, Dundee (% 01382-201-245;
www.rrsdiscovery.com). This is home to the famous RRS
Discovery, the ship sailed by Captain Robert Scott to Antarctica.
You can tour the vessel and get all the details of Scott’s historic
trip. By the way, RRS stands for “royal research ship.”
 Dunottar Castle, near Stonehaven (% 01569-762-173), is best
known for its breathtaking views. Much of the red sandstone struc-
ture, pitched above the cliffs and the North Sea, still stands. Often
the object of sieges, in the 17th century it was used as a prison for
nearly 200 recalcitrant Presbyterian Covenanters, and visitors can
see the cellar where they were held.
 Glamis Castle, near Forfar (% 01307-840-393; www.glamis-castle.
co.uk). This castle is notable for being the family home of the late
Queen Mother, born Elizabeth Bowes Lyon, wife of King George VI
and mother of Queen Elizabeth. A royal residence since 1372, it’s
actually more famous for being the (historically inaccurate) setting
for Shakespeare’s Macbeth.

The Stone of Scone: A long strange trip
Until just over 710 years ago, Scone Palace was the home of the Stone of Destiny, aka
the Stone of Scone, on which important early rulers such as David I, Macbeth, and
Robert the Bruce were enthroned. According to myth, the hunk of sandstone dates to
Biblical times, serving as Jacob’s pillow. It reputedly traveled through Egypt, Spain, and
Italy before coming to Scotland with Celtic pilgrims in the 9th century. It was then
deployed for the enthronement of Dalriadic kings in Argyll before being used by Scottish
royalty at Scone. So powerful was the lure of the stone that in 1296 English King Edward
I stole and then lodged it in Westminster Abbey, where English kings and queens hoped
to get some of its magic during coronations. On Christmas Day, 1950, the stone was pur-
loined by Scottish nationalists, who put it in Arbroath Abbey, where the 1320 Scottish
declaration of sovereignty was signed. However, it was soon returned to London. In 1996,
it was finally returned officially to Scotland with plenty of manufactured fanfare and is
now on display in Edinburgh Castle. Presumably, this is where it stays.

If you want to visit more castles than I have given details for, then
follow the official Castle Trail linking about a dozen historic piles 
in the Northeast. Log on to the Aberdeen and Grampian tourist
board Web site www.agtb.org/scottish-castles.htm for more
information.
 Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Kinnaird Head, Fraserburgh 
(% 01346-511-022). This museum is a must-see for lighthouse
buffs and is recommended if you have any interest in the towers 
of all shapes and sizes that have kept sailors safe at sea for more
than 200 years.
Shopping for Local Treasures
With its cluster of tartan and woolens shops, such as Macnaughtons,
Pitlochry offers the classic Highland gateway shopping experience,
where you may just find the perfect wooly jumper to keep you warm.
Both Dundee and Aberdeen offer a full range of shops these days, with
many of the stores you would expect to find in provincial cities. As ever,
tourist attractions invariably have visitor centers with gifts and sou-
venirs. Also consider visiting the shops below.
 Baxter’s Highland Village, Fochabers, (% 01343-820-666; www.
baxters.com). The HQ and retail outlet for Baxter’s food products,
which are primarily jams and soups. Besides the food shop, you
can also stop in the store Coat & Swagger for clothing and gifts. Call
to confirm seasonal opening hours.
 Le Chocolatier, 29 Scott St., Perth (% 01738-620-039). This heav-
enly shop offers lots of tasty handmade sweets, from butter fudges
to chocolates for diabetics. Open Monday through Saturday from 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 McEwan Gallery, on A939, near Ballater (% 013397-55429). If
you’re looking for art, this gallery is a trove of 19th and 20th cen-
tury Scottish artworks. They are nice high-end souvenirs. Call to
confirm seasonal hours.
Doing the Pub Crawl
While you might happily settle for your hotel’s bar — especially if you’re
at the Craigellachie or Darroch Learg — or one of the many rural taverns
dotted about the region, for a serious crawl Aberdeen has a range of
classic pubs, stylish bars, and nightlife options. Here are a couple of the
better traditional options.
 Old Blackfriars, 52 Castlegate (% 01224-581-922). This pub fea-
tures cask-conditioned real Scottish ales and a host of honest pub
grub served all day until about 7:30 p.m. Open Monday through
Saturday from 11 a.m. to midnight and Sunday 12:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.
Chapter 17: Tayside and the Northeast 343

 The Prince of Wales, 7 St. Nicholas Lane (% 01224-640-597).
Dating back to 1850, this is possibly the best place to grab a pint in
Aberdeen. The Prince of Wales is an old-fashioned pub with cozy
booths and an excellent spectrum of ales. The only problem is that
it can get crowded, but that’s the price of popularity. Open through
Saturday 11 a.m. to midnight, and Sunday noon to midnight.

Chapter 18
The Highlands
In This Chapter
 Finding a bed for the night, both on and off the beaten path
 Hunting (briefly) for the Loch Ness Monster
 Exploring the highest mountains and deepest lochs in the country
 Seeing the best of the rugged West Coast and its pristine beaches
A
fter Edinburgh and Glasgow, the Highlands region is the most popu-
lar draw for visitors to Scotland — and for good reason. The tourist
trail through the Highlands can include breathtaking Glen Coe and the
beautifully desolate Rannoch Moor; the scenic “Road to the Isles” west
of Fort William into Lochaber, where mountains meet the sea; remote
western peninsulas such as Morvern, Ardnamurchan, or Knoydart; the
Great Glen and, of course, the most famous body of water in Scotland,
Loch Ness. But, honestly, that’s only the beginning.
It’s easy to be overwhelmed when you’re trying to visit an area this
remote, divided by lochs and mountain ranges, connected only by wind-
ing highways and one-lane roads. Use a map to plot your course and
mark off the things you want to see. Then figure out the best order in
which to see them, whether coming or going.
The capital of the Highlands is Inverness and it is the region’s only bona
fide city. The River Ness runs through the town center, which has shops,
restaurants, bars, and accommodations (as well as a nice castle and
museum, but few other attractions). I suggest that Inverness is best as a
one-day stop or perhaps a comfortable base from which to explore parts
of the Highlands.
Fort William lies at the foot of Ben Nevis (the highest mountain in Great
Britain), at the far end of Loch Linnhe. This location, on the roads lead-
ing north through the Great Glen to Loch Ness and going west towards
Glenfinnan, means that tourists regularly pass through Fort William,
which has shops and restaurants to accommodate visitors.
I don’t really consider either Inverness or Fort William as highlights.
West Coast villages and towns really worth seeing include Arisaig,
Mallaig, Plockton, and Ullapool. In the east sit Tain and Dornoch, while
Durness is in the far north. Durness features a small memorial in memory

of the late Beatle John Lennon, who often went there on vacations. If
you’re looking for truly wild and sparsely populated territory, I would
suggest traveling north of the fishing port Ullapool, into the Assynt and
Sutherland regions of the northwest Highlands.
Getting There
Inverness is well served by buses and trains. If you’re making the big
leap north from Glasgow or Edinburgh, you may want to consider taking
public transportation to reach the capital of the Highlands. Then, after
you arrive, you can rent a car. You can also take the train from Glasgow
to Fort William and transfer there for another train up to Mallaig — 
possibly the most scenic train ride in the entire U.K. Local bus services
crisscross the Highlands, but, for optimal mobility, a car is quite useful.
 By car: The A82 runs through a good portion of the Highlands from
Loch Lomond and Crianlarich north to Fort William and then into
Inverness. From the east, the A9 from Perth heads north to Inver-
ness and then on to Tain, as well. Other key roads in the region
include the A830 (the so-called Road to the Isles) from Fort William
to Mallaig; the A87 from Invergarry to the Kyle of Lochalsh; the
A835 from Inverness to Ullapool; and the A836 from Tain to Tongue
and the far north coast.
 By bus: Scottish Citylink (% 0870-550-5050; www.citylink.co.
uk) routes hit all the major Highland towns.
 By train: First ScotRail (% 0845-748-4950; www.firstscotrail.
com) travels to major towns in the region, including Fort William
and Mallaig on the West Highland Lines and Inverness, Tain, Kyle of
Lochalsh, and even Thurso. You have to rely on buses or local taxis
after you arrive by train, however. ScotRail service to Inverness
dovetails with long-distance trains from England run by Great
North Eastern Railway. You can also call National Railway Enquiries
at the First ScotRail phone number above for details.
 By plane: Inverness/Dalcross Airport (% 01463-23-2471) is at
Dalcross, 13km (8 miles) east of Inverness. The airport handles
flights to and from Glasgow and Edinburgh.
 By ferry: Caledonian MacBrayne (% 01475-650-100; www.
calmac.co.uk) — or CalMac, as it’s more colloquially known —
serves 22 islands and four peninsulas over the West Coast of
Scotland. In the Highlands, this includes service from Mallaig to
Skye and Ullapool to the Outer Hebrides.
Spending the Night
You may want to stay in tourist-friendly Inverness or Fort William, but
the rest of the Highlands towns and villages hide some real treats, too.

The Highlands
Chapter 18: The Highlands 347

Some accommodations have earned star ratings from the tourist board;
see Chapter 8 for a description of the rating system and information on
self-catering accommodations, of which there are quite a few in the
Highlands. Rates listed here include full breakfast, unless otherwise
stated. You may well get a better deal than the advertised “rack” rates.
In addition to the options listed below, also have a quick read through
the “Dining Locally” section that follows. I’ve highlighted a few of the
restaurants listed there that also have limited overnight accommodation.

The Black Isle 
Formerly known as the Royal Hotel in the handsome seaside village of
Fortrose, the Anderson prides itself as a gastronomic oasis in the
Highlands. Scottish ingredients get the international treatment, whether
it’s a bowl Shetland mussels steamed in a red curry and coconut broth or
plate of wild Scotch venison goulash. The pub’s no slouch either, boasting
160 single malt whiskies, real ales from Scotland and England, and some 60
Belgian beers. The nine overnight rooms combine antiques with modern
conveniences in this historic building, while the welcome from owners Jim
and Anne Anderson is always warm and accommodating.

Arisaig Hotel
$$–$$$
Arisaig
With views of the lovely bay at Arisaig, its small harbor, and the isles
beyond, this hotel captures the essence of the Western Highlands and
island experience without even trying. Rooms are tidy and well appointed,
if not exceptionally large. The best ones face onto the sea. A restaurant
and popular local pub (renovated in early 2007) as well as a playroom for
children are on the premises.

Ballachulish House
$$$–$$$$
Ballachulish
The small eight-room hotel between Glen Coe and Fort William is
renowned for its meals, which have earned recognition from the per-
snickety Michelin guide. Dinner is a three- to five-course gourmet excur-
sion using mostly local produce in dishes such as smoked duck with
orange and elderberry sauce or seared scallops with chive creamed pota-
toes. Rooms are generally roomy and well-appointed, while the hotel’s
public spaces include a drawing room, library, and walled garden. If that
wasn’t enough, in 2001, the 9-hole Ballachulish House Golf Course was
completed adjacent to the hotel.

Ballifeary House Hotel
$$
Inverness
This four-star guesthouse is in a quiet residential area along the River Ness
and within easy walking distance of the Inverness city center. You won’t find
a closer accommodation — without hearing car horns and pedestrians — to
the heart of the Highland capital. The Edwardian villa has lovely sitting
rooms and six well-kept overnight units that exude comfort. Families take
note, however: The minimum age for guests is 15.

The Ceilidh Place
$$–$$$
Ullapool
How many hotels organize their rooms on the basis of the mini-library that
each contains? Fair to say, not many. But here at the Ceilidh Place, which
has its own acclaimed bookshop on the premises, each overnight unit fea-
tures a set of books selected by a Scottish writer or luminary. Like the
sound of the literature and pick the room. This charming if rather idio-
syncratic hotel often hosts live traditional and folk music performances, as
well as other cultural events.

Corriechoille Lodge 
$$
Near Spean Bridge
The sitting room of this stone guesthouse offers views of the nearby Nevis
Range Mountains. An 18th-century stone fishing lodge about 19km (12
miles) northeast of Fort William was converted into this luxurious hide-
away with all the trimmings. No children younger than seven are permit-
ted, and the lodge is closed Monday and Tuesday nights. In addition to the
lodge, there are two one-bedroom log cabins on the property.

Dunain near Inverness
In a tourist-strategic position between Loch Ness and Inverness, the
Dunain is a wonderful, old Georgian country–house hotel surrounded 
by gardens and the woods beyond. Some of the well-dressed rooms have

Glengarry Castle Hotel
$$–$$$
Invergarry
You’d be hard pressed to find a prettier spot for such highly regarded
country inn lodgings. This 26-room Victorian mansion is on extensive
wooded grounds with its own castle ruins (the real Glengarry Castle) and
nice views of Loch Oich. Some of the warmly decorated rooms have four-
poster beds and exposed ceiling beams. The four-star hotel also has tennis
courts and rowboats for guest use, while afternoon high tea is served for
those in the mood for less robust activities.

Glen Mhor Hotel

Inverness
This 43-bedroom Victorian hotel overlooks the banks of the River Ness just
below Inverness castle. The lobbies and the restaurants, including Nico’s
Bistro (see listing in the section “Dining Locally”), are lovely spots with
overstuffed chairs, tartan upholstery, and oak paneling. The rooms are
large and the beds generally firm.

Inverlochy Castle
$$$$
Fort William
Fort William’s most highly rated accommodations, and one of the best
luxury hotels in Scotland, Inverlochy Castle hotel is beautifully situated in
the foothills of Ben Nevis. Staying here can be literally an experience fit
for royalty: Queen Victoria visited for a week in 1873 and wrote in her
diary, “I never saw a lovelier or more romantic spot.” That sentiment still
rings true today. The sitting rooms and dining area are inspiring — flaw-
lessly decorated and illuminated by chandeliers. The attention to fine
detail and maximum comfort extends to the guest rooms as well, which
have lovely views. The food is gourmet, and after you’ve had your fill of
rich food and posh surroundings, you can tour the 200-hectare (500-acre)
grounds.

Lodge on the Loch
$$$–$$$$
Onich
A stay at the Lodge on the Loch should leave an indelible memory of your
visit to the Highlands. With some of the finest vistas in the country, this
serene family-run retreat overlooks Loch Linnhe 8km (5 miles) or so west
of Glencoe. The house was built in 1870 as a country home, and today the
cozy rooms — each individually named — are decorated in Art Nouveau
and Shaker styles. Take time to explore the grounds to the shore or through
the gardens. Targeting couples, it discourages children younger than 16.

The Moorings Hotel
$$–$$$
Near Fort William
On a quiet residential stretch outside Fort William’s town center, this
labyrinthine hotel is bigger than it looks. The large, comfortable rooms
stretch back to the Caledonian Canal; some units have views of the locks
(aka Neptune’s Staircase) and the boats going through. The staff is helpful,
the beds are comfortable, and all rooms have satellite television. Superior
rooms have better views, living areas, and king-size beds.

Moyness House is arguably the finest guesthouse in Inverness (the other
contender being Ballifeary House, whose review appears earlier in this sec-
tion). This quaint, white-washed Victorian villa is located in a quiet resi-
dential district within easy strolling distance of the Inverness city center.
Each one of the seven homey overnight units is individually decorated and
comfortably done up, with modern en suite bathrooms.

Nairn
Just before you enter the little coastal town of Nairn from the west, you
should spot this castlelike hotel located in parkland and overlooking the
Nairn Championship Golf Course. It could be just the thing you need after
a busy day of sightseeing. The overnight rooms are quite large, and the
comfortable public rooms are decorated with antique furniture. In addition
to the usual room facilities, other nice touches include heated bathroom

Plockton
The village of Plockton (see “top attractions” below) is one of the pretti-
est you’ll find in the Highlands and this is the only hotel on the waterfront,
looking onto a sheltered bay in Loch Carron. The 11 overnight accommo-
dations include two that work as family rooms, and there’s a four-bedroom
cottage annex nearby. All the units have en suite bathrooms, and a half
dozen offer sea views. The hotel’s dining room and award-garnering pub
are well known for fresh fish and seafood dishes.

Polmaily House Hotel

Near Drumnadrochit
For an Edwardian country house, Polmaily sure knows how to provide
modern family friendly accommodations during the high season. The high-
ceilinged bedrooms are large and elegant, and the hotel also features a
heated indoor pool, video games, tennis courts, mountain bikes, and fish-
ing. In the summer, parents will appreciate the supervised fun room, organ-
ized children’s activities, outdoor play areas, and large suites. In the mid-
and low seasons, the business operates more as boutique hotel.

Scourie
This one-time coaching inn way up north in Sutherland is one those hotels
that believes guests have better things to do than sit in their rooms and
watch television. (There are no TVs here, by the way, although they’ll pro-
vide you with a radio if asked.) Rooms are quite homey and spacious.
Some of them overlook Scourie Bay, while others have vistas towards the
inland mountains, such as Ben Stack. It’s a top spot for fishing enthusiasts,
too, with hotel boats available.

ones below.

Inverness
FRENCH
Since being a patient — or should it be victim —of Chef Gordon Ramsay’s
reality TV makeover program, this restaurant in the Glenmoriston Town
House Hotel (with overnight rooms), has turned its fortunes around. In
addition to the a la carte menus, you can opt for an eight-course tasting
menu — or go for the “chef’s table” which takes place in the kitchen and
where Chef Loic Lefebvre and staff can explain each dish.

Applecross Inn
$$
Applecross
FISH/SEAFOOD
This may not be the easiest place to reach, but many visitors feel the twists
and turns of the road to Applecross are well worth it for a meal at the inn
(which also has overnight rooms). This one-time fisherman’s cottage sits
right on the shores of the Inner Sound of Raasay, looking out toward the
mountains on the Isle of Skye. Naturally, seafood dishes make up the
majority of the menu, but you can expect local venison or sausages, too.
The Applecross, with an excellent selection of real ale, is also rated one of
Scotland’s best country pubs.

The small, well-chosen menu here is often a delight, especially when it

Crannog
$$$
Fort William
FISH/SEAFOOD
Offering fine views, this restaurant sits on stilts out over the waters of Loch
Linnhe — a location that led to severe storm damage a few years back.
After repairs, the restaurant returned to its town pier location. The owners
deploy their own fleet (and run a smokehouse, too), so expect the fresh-
est of fish. A plate of langoustine with hot garlic butter is highly touted.
By the way, crannog is the Gaelic word for an artificial island on the banks
of a loch — how appropriate.

The Fishmarket Restaurant

Mallaig
FISH/SEAFOOD
Situated right on the harbor and serving dishes that incorporate freshly
caught fish, this restaurant is a casual place for a meal. Main courses might
include poached haddock with mussels, roasted whole sea bass with
fennel and ginger, or traditional fish and chips. Prawns (shrimp) come in
by the ton here at Mallaig and are thus one of the restaurant’s specialties.

dinner in the smartly planned wine selection. The fixed-price lunches are
a particular bargain.

SCOTTISH
This small, simple venture by the water is a favorite among locals because
of its good eats at even better prices. During the day, it acts very much
like a cafe with croissant sandwiches or stuffed baked potatoes. In the
evening, the candles come out and the cuisine is more formal with spe-
cialties such as filet of Scottish salmon or duck breast.

ship taking the more formal name of Rocpool Rendezvous, while a newer
outlet called Rocpool Reserve offers a restaurant and boutique hotel a
small distance across town. Either way, Rocpool remains the most ambi-
tious, modern, and stylish (including unisex toilets) restaurant in the city
of Inverness. The menu may range from mussels in Thai red curry to pis-
tachio crusted goats cheese soufflé.

Exploring the Highlands
You can find plenty of tourist attractions between Inverness and Fort
William, but please don’t confine yourself to the well-known Loch Ness
hot spots. In addition to those heavily touristed sites, you have a wide
choice of things to see throughout the Highlands: ancient monuments,
lovely lochs, picturesque villages, natural areas for hiking, sandy and
unspoiled beaches, and a good number of excellent castles.

Guided tours
The Highlands lends itself to smartly operated theme tours, whether
relating to the area’s rich historic heritage or unique natural history.
Refer to my suggestions in “Seeing Scotland by Bus” in Chapter 7 for a
list of reputable guided tours setting off from Edinburgh or Glasgow.
Here are a couple of the more interesting specialized tours to take, too.
 Ecoventure (% 01381-600-323; www.ecoventures.co.uk): This
company takes you to see a local colony of bottlenose dolphins
living off the Black Isle. As many as 130 live in one area of the
Moray Firth, and they’re generally friendly and unafraid to approach
the boat. The tour also covers other sea life such as seals, por-
poise, and even the occasional minke whale. Tours depart from
Cromarty Harbor at the tip of the Black Isle, off the A832 at the
junction of Bank Street and High Street in Cromarty. Tickets cost
£20 ($37) per person, £15 ($28) for children 5 to 12 years old. The
tour lasts about two hours.
 Jacobite Cruises (% 01463-233-999; www.jacobite.co.uk):
Jacobite Cruises, which take visitors out on Loch Ness, are perhaps
the most efficient and best organized tours of the loch. You can
choose from a number of different excursions, such as the “Passion
Cruise & Tour,” a six-plus hour trip down the loch, through the
Caledonian Canal, stopping at Urquhart (irk-ett) Castle and the
Corrimony Cairns. Alternatively, the “Inspiration Cruise” takes only
one hour on the loch. The company runs minibuses to the launch
site from the Inverness Tourist Information Centre on Bridge Street.
Alternatively, you can drive to the Clansman Harbour, 13km (8
miles) southwest of the city outskirts, off the A82. Tours operate
year round, and fares start at £8 ($15).

Abernethy Forest Reserve
Loch Garten
Some 10km (6 miles) northeast of Aviemore in the Cairngorm Mountains,
this aviary reserve on the shores of Loch Garten is operated by the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). It offers an observation center
to spy on the osprey, once thought to be extinct in Scotland. They still,
horribly, remain targets of assorted idiots, but since the mid-1950s, the
osprey have returned from Africa to nest here in the spring. The observa-
tion center deploys telescopes and video cameras to help visitors see the
young birds of prey at play. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 347. Near Boat of Garten. % 01479-831-476. www.rspb.org.uk.
Admission: £3 ($5.55) adults, £2 ($3.70) seniors, 50p ($1) children younger than 15, £6

Chapter 18: The Highlands 357
Ardnamurchan Peninsula
One of the more easily reached but seemingly remote areas of the
Highlands, the Ardnamurchan Peninsula is the most westerly point in the
entire British mainland. One highlight is the ruins of Castle Tioram (see
the listing later in this section), but the peninsula also has pretty beaches
and tide pools, a natural history and visitor center near Glenmore, and lots
of hiking trails. The lighthouse at the craggy Point of Ardnamurchan can
feel like the end of the earth on a windy day. From Kilchoan on the penin-
sula, you can take a ferry to and from Tobermory on the Isle of Mull in the
summer. Allow about 24 hours.

See map p. 347. West of Fort William. Take the A861 from the Road to the Isles (A830)
at Lochailort or use the small ferry service to Corran a few kilometers north of
Ballachulish (A82). www.ardnamurchan.com. Admission: free.
Balnakeil Craft Village
Near Durness
This artist community, on the outskirts of Durness near Cape Wrath, has
plenty of galleries selling local artwork. The craft village is housed in a
former military communications installation with lots of flat-roofed insti-
tutional looking buildings. Still the place is friendly, communal, and, yes,
vaguely hippy-esque. The cafe serves tasty natural foods, and the book-
shop is well-stocked with local titles. If you’ve come this far, you may as
well carry on to the end of the road to see the old ruins of a 17th century
church and the lovely Balnakeil beach. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 347. Off the A838 (1km/1⁄2 mile west of Durness; 108km/67 miles north of
Ullapool). www.durness.org. Admission: free.
Ben Nevis
Near Fort William
At 1,344m (4,410 ft.), Ben Nevis is the tallest mountain in the United
Kingdom, although it’s difficult to see just how tall it is from the usual van-
tage points around Fort William. The round-trip hike to the summit is
about 16km (10 miles) and takes around seven hours (four up and three
down). You will need to wear good boots and have both warm- and cold-
weather gear, because the temperature and weather can fluctuate unpre-
dictably at certain heights. Don’t attempt to transverse the summit
without a proper map and compass and also don’t start your ascent of Ben
Nevis too late in the day. The tourist office in Fort William has trail maps
if you’re planning to make the big climb. Allow about seven hours.
See map p. 347. Path leaves from Glen Nevis Road, just outside Fort William. % 01397-
703-781. www.visit-fortwilliam.co.uk. Admission: free.
Castle Tioram
Near Blain on Loch Moidart
The impressive ruins of this classic medieval fortress (pronounced roughly
cheer-rum) sit on a rocky spit of land extending into the picturesque waters
of Loch Moidart. Once a key outpost for clan MacDonald for hundreds of
years, a rich Scotsman has now bought the pile of stone and wants to fix it
up and live here. Some historic authorities have other plans, however. Until
a final decision is made, Castle Tioram, one of my favorite castles, remains
a romantic site that is best accessed at low tide. Like so many castles in
Scotland, Tioram was sacked and burned during Jacobite uprisings — in
this instance apparently to keep it from falling into the hands of forces loyal
to the Hanovers in London. There are good hiking trails near the castle, too.
See map p. 347. Off the A861 from Blain. Admission: free.

Cawdor Castle
Near Nairn
Cawdor, with its dramatic drawbridge and medieval tower, is full of treas-
ures, and particularly tapestries, from around the world. The gardens are
pretty wonderful, too, with wildflowers, fountains, and a maze of holly
bushes. Legend has it that the Thane of Cawdor (then spelled Calder)
determined the location of the castle by giving instructions to build wher-
ever his donkey decided to rest (as he had dreamed). The animal stopped
in the shade of a mature thorn bush, and deep within the castle, its stump
(carbon dated to about 1370) still stands today. Although Macbeth was
Shakespeare’s Thane of Cawdor, neither he nor his good lady could have
resided here: The castle wasn’t build yet. Allow about three hours.
See map p. 347. On the B9090, off the A96 between Inverness and Nairn. % 01667-
404-401. www.cawdorcastle.com. Admission: £7 ($13) adults, £6 ($11) seniors and
students, £4.50 ($8.30) children 5–15, £22 ($41) family. Open: May–early Oct daily 10
a.m.–5:30 p.m. Closed mid-Oct to Apr.
Clava Cairns
Culloden
If you’re visiting the nearby Culloden Moor Battlefield (see the next list-
ing), Clava Cairns — also known as the Balnuaran of Clava — is worth a
brief visit. Basically a 4,000-year-old graveyard, the cairns are part of best
preserved Bronze Age cemetery in Scotland. The large circular pits of rock
and rubble, two of which are aligned on the winter solstice, are slightly
eerie. Nearby are standing stones in a grove of trees and ruins of an ancient
chapel. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 347. Off the B9091, just east of Culloden Battlefield. www.historic-
scotland.gov.uk. % 01667-460-232. Admission: free. Open: daily 24 hours.
Culloden Moor Battlefield
Culloden Moor
This marshy field is where the hopes of Bonnie Prince Charlie’s Jacobite
uprising of 1745 (begun at Glenfinnan, see “Glenfinnan Monument,” later in
this section) ended in complete defeat on April 16, 1746. The bloody battle
(the last significant one fought on the British mainland) was over in about
an hour, and Charlie was among the few Jacobites who escaped unharmed.
After their defeat, Highland life was censored and restricted by a London
administration tired of rebellion and its Scottish allies. The visitor center
provides interesting details, with a museum and an excellent film about
the battle. Take the time to walk through the battlefield, which has clan
stones and cairns in memory of those who lost their lives. The terrain is
kept the same as 260 years ago, when boggy conditions contributed to the
Jacobites’ defeat. Allow about 21⁄2 hours.
See map p. 347. Off the B9006 (8km/5 miles east of Inverness). % 01463-790-607.

Eilean Donan Castle
Dornie
Grab your camera: Eilean Donan is certainly the most photographed stone
pile in the Highlands. On an islet in Loch Duich, this quintessential castle
(which lay in utter ruins for two centuries) is accessible by an arched
bridge. Originally built in the early 1200s by Alexander II to deter Viking
invaders, the castle was demolished at the hands of Hanoverian troops
during the Jacobite uprising of 1719. In the early decades of the 20th cen-
tury, it was essentially rebuilt. Highlights include walking the ramparts,
the banqueting hall and billeting room, as well as Jacobite relics. B-movie
fans will be excited by the fact that Highlander was filmed here. Allow
about two hours.
See map p. 347. Dornie, Kyle of Lochalsh, on the A87. % 01599-555-202. www.eilean
donancastle.com. Admission: £5 ($9.25) adults; £4 ($7.40) seniors, students, and
children younger than 16. Open: Apr–Oct 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m. Closed Nov–Mar.
Glen Coe
Glencoe
It’s hard to believe that such a beautiful valley has such a bloody event
tied to it. Glen Coe is where a historic massacre took place on February 6,
1692. On that fateful day, the Campbell Earl of Argyle’s regiment — on
orders approved by the king, William of Orange — slaughtered about 40
members of clan MacDonald, including some women and children. What
makes their killings truly distressing is the fact that Campbell’s troops had
been staying as guests, albeit not welcomed ones. Thus, Glen Coe is right
up there with Culloden when it comes to tragic bloodshed at the hands of
troops loyal to the central government in England. In spite of the area’s
grim history, this spectacular valley extends about 16km (10 miles) from
the king’s house in the east to the shores of Loch Leven and the village of
Glencoe in the west. The National Trust for Scotland’s eco-friendly visitor
center has area trail maps and audiovisual presentations of local geogra-
phy. You can also see a monument of the massacre in Carnoch. Ranger-led
walks take place throughout the summer. Allow about three hours.
See map p. 347. On the A82, just east of Ballachulish. % 01855-811-307. www.nts.
org.uk. Admission: £5 ($9.25) adults; £4 ($7.40) seniors, students, and children; £14
($26) family. Open: site daily year-round; visitor center daily Apr–Aug 9:30 a.m.–5:30
p.m., Sept–Oct 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Nov–Mar 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Glenfinnan Monument
Glenfinnan
This monument marks the hopeful start of the 1745 Jacobite rebellion led
by Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was trying to reclaim the English and
Scottish crowns for his Stuart family lineage. Be sure to take your camera;
Part IV: The Major Regions 
360

this monument (and now slightly sacred historical ground) amid Highland
scenery is a great spot for pictures, especially if you’re lucky enough to
see the steam train (see below) cross the arched viaduct behind the visi-
tor center. (Fans of the Harry Potter films will recognize the setting.) The
Jacobites allegedly left from this spot to successfully push all the way to
Derby in England before turning back and being crushed at Culloden (see
“Culloden Moor Battlefield” earlier in this section). The Jacobite cause has
captured the Scots’ collective imagination, and the National Trust of
Scotland visitor center provides a good primer on the Jacobites and Prince
Charlie. The monument can be vaguely magical, especially on one of my
visits when a lone piper broke the silence of twilight with mournful play-
ing from a heather-filled hillside. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 347. On A830, next to Loch Shiel (29km/18 miles west of Fort William). 
% 01397-722-250. www.nts.org.uk. Admission: £3 ($5.55) adults; £2 ($3.70) sen-
iors, students, and children. Open: site daily year-round; visitor center daily Apr–Jun
and Sept–Oct 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; July–Aug 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Nov weekends only 10
a.m.–4 p.m. Closed Dec–Mar.
Inverewe Garden
Near Poolewe
The most impressive garden in the Highlands is on the south-facing shores
of Loch Ewe, about 10km (6 miles) northeast of the village of Gairloch.
Because the North Atlantic drift carries warmer waters up from the
Caribbean, the climate here is surprisingly temperate. The plants are a tes-
tament to the ideal growing conditions. In late summer, you can see cabbages
the size of basketballs in the large vegetable patch within the walled garden.
The sprawling 20 hectare (50-acre) garden, however, encompasses much
more than just vegetables, including rhododendron and pine walks, a “bam-
booselem,” two ponds, and a rock garden. Diverse planting means something
is in bloom all year round, from azaleas in spring to Kaffir lilies in the autumn.
See map p. 347. On A832. % 01455-781-200. Fax: 01455-781-497. www.nts.org.uk.
Admission: £8 ($15) adult, £5.25 ($9.70) seniors and students, £20 ($38) family. Open:

Plockton: The prettiest Highland village?
Not far from Eilean Donan, Plockton (www.plockton.com) is arguably the prettiest vil-
lage in the Highlands. The crescent-shaped, harborside main street, on the shores of
Loch Carron, is lined with cute cottages, while the sidewalks are punctuated with palm
trees that defy the northern latitudes. Plockton gained fame in the U.K. as the location
for a BBC TV series, Hamish Macbeth, starring a then little-known Robert Carlyle as a
laid-back, pot-smoking policeman. Today, Plockton features some good grub at the pubs
in the Plockton Inn on Innes Street and the Plockton Hotel (see “Spending the Night”).
Plockton is about 10km (6 miles) northeast of Kyle of Lochalsh, off the A87.

The Jacobite Steam Train
Fort William and Mallaig railway stations
The 68km (42 mile) train ride between Fort William and the port town of
Mallaig is one of the most picturesque rail journeys in Europe. As you chug
along past mountains, skirting lochs and glens, you’ll pass the Glenfinnan
Monument and miles and miles of dramatic, unspoiled scenery. It’s hard to
believe that the rail line wasn’t built for the delight of visitors; rather, it
was created to bring catches of fish inland. At the Glenfinnan station, a
small train museum is worth a look, and you can take a break in the cafe
located in an old train car. If you take the round-trip, the schedule allows
you 11⁄2 hours in Mallaig. Not every train on this route is the historic steam
train, so confirm schedules if you want to ride the real thing. Allow about
51⁄2 hours round-trip.
See map p. 347. Fort William and Mallaig railway stations. % 01524-737-751. www.
westcoastrailway.co.uk. Tickets: £27 ($50) standard adult round-trip or £20
($38) one-way, £16 ($30) standard children round-trip or £12 ($22) one-way. Open:
June to mid-Oct one round-trip Mon–Fri departing from Fort William at 10:20 a.m.,
returning from Mallaig at 2:10 p.m.; mid-summer also departs Sat–Sun. Closed mid-
Oct to late May.
Loch Ness
Okay, this is it: The dark and deep (274m/900 ft. to be exact), mysterious,
and legendary Loch Ness. In addition to looking for the elusive monster,
you should seek out other local attractions, such as Urquhart Castle (see
the listing later in this section for more information). Although the drive
along the loch is good, the best way to experience it is by boat (see the
listing under “Guided tours,” earlier in this chapter). As for the monster,
little is known for certain. Although no one can confirm that it exists, it’s
apparently against the law to kill it. Is it out there? I say no, but keep an eye
out, just in case.
See map p. 347. On the A82 or the B852 on the eastern shore. Admission: free. Open:
year-round.

Ullapool: Happenings at the harbor
Ullapool, on the shores of Loch Broom, is the busiest fishing port on the northwest
coast of Scotland. Established reasonably recently in 1788 as a planned village by the
British Fisheries Society, the town has become a popular resort in its own right — the
last outpost before the sparsely populated northwest. If you need to stock up at a
supermarket, stop in Ullapool. It also has some good casual restaurants that feature
freshly landed fish and seafood, like crabs, while the Ceilidh Place (see “Spending the
Night”) is a hub of cultural activity with frequent music and dance events through the
summer season. The Ullapool Museum, West Argyle Street (% 01854-612-987; www.
ullapoolmuseum.co.uk), is open year-round; call for times. 

Loch Ness 2000 Exhibition
Drumnadrochit
Visiting this attraction is rather like reading Loch Ness For Dummies (if
there were such a book). In other words, it covers the bases without bury-
ing you in details. Focusing mainly on monster myths and the technology
of scientific monster hunting, Loch Ness 2000 offers a reasonably enter-
taining exhibit using laser lights and digital projection displays. And while
the kids may marvel at the smoke and mirrors, you’ll actually learn a
couple things about the long history of sightings, research, and theories on
the monster. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 347. Drumnadrochit, Loch Ness, off the A82. % 01456-450-573. www.
loch-ness-scotland.com. Admission: £5.95 ($11) adults, £4.50 ($8.30) seniors
and students, £3.50 ($6.50) children younger than 16, £15 ($28) family. Open: daily
Easter–May 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Jun and Sept 9 a.m.–6 p.m., July–Aug 9 a.m.–8 p.m.,
Oct 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Nov–Easter 10 a.m.–3:30 p.m.
The Original Loch Ness Monster Visitor Centre
Drumnadrochit
This is the “other” Loch Ness exhibit, the older and slightly less expensive
one, compared to the flashier competition in town. The focus of the exhibit
is on the loch, which has an interesting history, as well as the monster. A
film covers the history of Nessie sightings and explains how many are actu-
ally of something else, such as sea otters. The exhibition is full of pictures,
including other freaks of beast lore. Allow about one hour.
On the A82. % 01456-450-342. www.lochness-centre.com. Admission: £5 ($9.25)
adults, £3.50 ($6.50) seniors, £3.75 ($7) students, £3 ($5.55) children younger than 16.
Open: Mar–June and Sept–Oct 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; July–Aug 9 a.m.–7:30 p.m.;

Sands of Morar
Near Mallaig
Bonnie Prince Charlie apparently roamed these beautiful bleached beaches
250 years ago while fleeing his oppressors. Set against postcard-pretty seas,
looking across at the islands Rhum and Eigg, Morar has become a popular
locale for filmmakers intent on capturing the quintessential Scottish back-
drop. Highlander and, to much better effect, Local Hero were filmed here.
Unfortunately, the sands can get rather crowded — at least by local 
standards — with sun-seeking locals and tourists in the summer. Allow
about one hour.
See map p. 347. Just off the A830, about a 1.5km (1 mile) south of Morar. Admission:
free. Open: year-round.

Sandwood Estate and Bay
Near Blairmore
Purchased in the early 1990s by the John Muir Trust, the Sandwood Estate
has the beach that, by most accounts, is the most beautiful and unsullied
on the entire mainland of Great Britain. Yes, getting there and back from
the nearest road requires a 14km (9 miles) hike on a peat-and-stone trail.
But then why do you think the dunes at Sandwood Bay are so pristine?
The entire estate covers many thousands of acres and encompasses crofts
and peat bogs as well as dunes and craggy coastline. From here, the ambi-
tious can also hike to Cape Wrath. Allow about three hours.
See map p. 347. Take the B801 from the A838 to Blairmore (about 96km/60 miles north
of Ullapool, via the A894). www.jmt.org. Admission: free. Open: year-round.
Urquhart Castle
Loch Ness
Despite the impressive ruins, this large and significant castle (pronounced
irk-ett) has no strong clan association. Because its location on Loch Ness
was important for trade routes through the Highlands, the castle has
changed hands many times since the 13th century. One of the last groups
to occupy it (before the tourists invaded) was Cromwell’s army in the
1650s; later it was blown up to prevent Jacobite occupation. A recent addi-
tion to the visitor center is an audiovisual display of views and history that
plays before you see the real thing. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 347. Near Drumnadrochit, on the A82. % 01456-450-551. www.

Snow in the Highlands
Alas, it seems climate change has currently made snowfall increasingly rare in the
Highlands, and some resorts have tottered on closure. In addition to the Nevis Range
Gondola and Skiing (see “Other cool things to see and do”), the Highlands offer other
legitimate ski resorts. Glencoe has moderately challenging slopes and some great
views. The Glencoe Mountain Resort is near Kingshouse, off the A82 (% 0871-
871-9929; www.glencoemountain.com). The Cairngorms offer unpredictable
weather, but when the snow base is good, the whole family can enjoy skiing or snow-
boarding, as well as other non-ski activities. CairnGorm Mountain resort (% 01479-
861-261; www.cairngormmountain.com) is located 14km (9 miles) from the town
of Aviemore and operates a funicular railway to get you up the mountain. 

Other cool things to see and do
 Brodie Castle, off the A96, about 11km (7 miles) east of Nairn 
(% 01309-641-371; www.nts.org.uk). It may look a bit austere,
but this 16th century tower house is a particularly good stop for
art fans; the collection of paintings includes 17th century Dutch
works, as well as the Scottish Colourists.
 Storehouse of Foulis, Evanton, off the A9 about 14km (9 miles)
north of Inverness (% 01349-830-000; www.clanland.com). The
interactive displays here focus on local music, food, topography,
and clan history. You can watch a video that’s a tribute to the pow-
erful Highland clan Munro. A small display focuses on seals that fre-
quent the nearby beaches.
 Dornoch Cathedral, on the main square of Dornoch 13km (8 miles)
south of Tain (% 01862-810-296). This cathedral dates to 1224 and
was the site of one of the last witch burnings in the 18th century.
But another reason you might wish to visit is because this is where
Madonna married Guy Ritchie. 
 Glenmore Forest Park, off the B972 about 10km (6miles) east of
Aviemore (% 01479-861-220; www.forestry.gov.uk). This wood-
land park isn’t simply a place of fine scenery. The attractions
include Loch Morlich and its sandy beach as well as a grove of
ancient Caledonian Pinewood, one of the few remaining in Scotland.
A visitor center has information. 
 Highland Folk Museum, Duke Street, on the A86, Kingussie 
(% 01540-661-307). The museum describes the last 400 years 
of Highland life with collections of everyday objects, furniture,
machines, and more. In addition to this site, with its re-created his-
toric Blackhouse, in Newtonmore, the Folk Museum offers a recon-
structed 18th-century township and 1940s working farm.
 Inverness Museum and Art Gallery, Castle Wynd, off Bridge Street,
Inverness (% 01463-237-114; www.invernessmuseum.com). Closed
in 2006 for renovation, but expected to reopen in early 2007, this
museum’s permanent collection includes period dress, old bag-
pipes, a cast of the death mask of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and pre-
historic stones. 
 John Cobb Cairn, between Drumnadrochit and Invermoriston.
This memorial cairn (a pile of stones) is a place of pilgrimage for
many who want to honor Cobb, who lost his life on Loch Ness in
1952 while making a second attempt at the world water-speed
record.
 Nevis Range Mountain Experience, 10km (6 miles) north of Fort
William (% 01397-705-825; www.nevisrange.co.uk). The Nevis
Range gondola takes you up Aonach Mor Mountain, offering pano-
ramic views. In summer, you can hike paths around the area. In
winter, you can ski or snowboard if snow conditions are good.

Shopping in the Highlands
The major shopping center in the Highlands is the Eastgate Shopping
Centre, 11 Eastgate, off High Street, in Inverness (www.eastgate-
centre.co.uk). This American-style mall doesn’t cater to tourists, but
it has major department stores. Eastgate is open from 9 a.m. until 5:30
p.m. most days, closing at 7 p.m. on Thursdays and 5 p.m. on Sundays.
Balnakeil Craft Village (see the listing in “The top attractions”) is a
good place to find unique gifts, while Ullapool (see the sidebar
“Ullapool”) has some interesting small craft shops. Also consider
 Edinburgh Woollen Mill, 13 High St., Fort William (% 01397-703-
064) and 60 High St., at Monzie Square, Fort William (% 01397-704-
737). Typical of woolen mill shops, these sister shops offer plenty
of variety in finely crafted woolen and tweed apparel. The best part
is their excellent bargains. Call for hours.
 Highland Stoneware Pottery, Mill Street, Ullapool (% 01854-612-
980; www.highlandstoneware.com) and Lochinver, north of
Ullapool on the coast road (% 01571-844-376). Since its inception
in 1974, Highland Stoneware has gained an international following.
Visitors for its unique freehand-decorated pottery come to the two
shops from all over the world. Open Monday through Friday from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays in season only (Easter–Oct) from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. They’re closed two weeks around Christmas and New
Year’s.
 Moniack Castle Wines, Beauly Road, on the A862, 11km (7 miles)
from Inverness (% 01463-831-283; www.moniackcastle.co.uk).
This popular winery and gourmet food shop makes six wines and
three liqueurs from natural ingredients such as birch bark. You can
also purchase top-quality marmalades, sauces, jams, and chutneys,
all made here, like the wine, from local ingredients. Open Monday
through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. in summer and Monday
through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in winter.
 Riverside Gallery, 11 Bank St., Inverness (% 01463-224-781). This
two-floor gallery near the banks of the River Ness has a wide range
of traditional and contemporary pieces by Scottish artists. Open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m.
Doing the Pub Crawl
The Highlands have a good number of atmospheric, quintessentially
Scottish pubs where you can relax and enjoy a bit of pub grub. Some of
my favorites at country inns include the Arisaig Plockton and Scourie
hotels. Listed below are a couple of additional favorites.
 Blackfriars, 93–95 Academy St., Inverness (% 01463-233-881). A
solid traditional pub with Scottish real ales on tap, live music on
Part IV: The Major Regions 
366

Saturday nights, and normally a couple of ceilidhs a week, too.
Open Sunday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Friday
and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m.
 Claichaig Inn, Glencoe, follow the sign from the A82 or walk across
the footbridge from the visitor center (% 01855-811-252). This
rustic pub’s wood-burning stove and the sunny disposition of the
staff both warm the woody lounge and bar. Climbers, tourists, and
locals come here for a wee rest stop and excellent ales on tap.
Open Sunday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Friday
from 11 a.m. to midnight, and Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.
 G’s, 9–21 Castle St., Inverness (% 01463-233-322; www.mr-gs.co.
uk). A nightclub rather than a pub, G’s is the best place for dancing
in Inverness. Admission prices range from £3 to £6 ($5.55–$11). The
club’s hours vary a bit but doors usually open at around 9:30 p.m.
and its late license keeps the place open until 3 a.m. on Friday and
Saturday nights.

Hebridean Islands
In This Chapter

 Finding the best sandy beaches and most picturesque ports 
 Discovering historic standing stones, churches, and castles
 Getting to some of the smaller isles for just a day
T
he allure of the Hebridean (Heb-ri-dee-an) Islands isn’t difficult to
understand: The history and culture of the Scottish isles — combined
with the beauty of the seascape — are utterly captivating. Getting to the
islands is half the fun, and when you arrive, you can be almost guaranteed
to have of a peaceful retreat from the mainland, particularly at places such
as Iona or Eigg. If I had to pick my personal favorite region of Scotland — a
hard choice, indeed — it would probably be the Hebrides.
Here are a few things you should know before you set out for these
islands.
Similar to other remote regions of Scotland, on the islands, many 
businesses — including hotels, restaurants, and attractions — close in
the off-season. I have done my best to indicate when things are open,
but if you’re traveling between mid-October and mid-April, please check
in advance.
Also, due to rather devout Protestant beliefs, some towns and villages
become virtual ghost towns on Sunday, particularly in parts of the outer
Hebrides. The Western Islands, home to the majority of Gaelic-speaking
people in Scotland, may have road signs posted only in Gaelic. Finally, the
Hebridean Islands get some of the most dramatic weather in Scotland —
in summer, sunshine can be followed by rain falling horizontally.
But none of that is any reason not to try to include at least a short stay
on one of the many islands that you can visit, whether the ones hugging
the mainland coast line, such as Skye and Mull, or those more far flung,
such as Harris or Uist. There are no cities, per se, on any of the
Herbridean Islands. The larger ports are Portree on Skye, Tobermory on
Mull, and Stornoway on Lewis. These towns all have banks, shops, gro-
cery stores, and other helpful amenities. 

Although the Hebrides chain is made up of several islands, many of
which are largely uninhabited, this chapter concentrates on the more
notable ones. Also, remember that the southernmost Hebridean island
of Islay is included in my chapter on “Ayrshire and Argyll.” 
As long as you enjoy sailing on ferries, island hopping through the
Hebrides can be a real blast, even if the trips can be time-consuming.
Alternatively, you can take one-day excursions from the mainland to
isles close to the coast for a taste of island life.
Getting to the Islands
One of the best things about any visit to the islands is the ferry ride.
Indeed, unless you charter a boat, there is no other way (with the excep-
tion of Skye) to get to the Hebrides. A network of boats links the Outer
and Inner Hebrides to the mainland and, in some cases, to one another.
You’ll probably want a car to explore the islands, but you can get around
without one, by bus or bike.
 By ferry: The principal provider of ferry services is Caledonian
MacBrayne or CalMac (% 08705-650-000 or 01475-650-100; www.
calmac.co.uk). Travel times vary. The ferry from Mallaig to
Armadale, Skye, takes only about 30 minutes. From Oban to
Craignure on Mull means about 45 minutes on the ferry. The trip,
however, from Ullapool to Stornoway, Lewis, clocks in at slightly
more than 21⁄2 hours. The larger ferries all have cafes and bars with
lounges.
On a trip through the Hebrides, you can take advantage of CalMac’s
“Island Hopscotch” tickets. For example, you may jump between
Skye, Uist, Harris, and Lewis, using the mainland ports of Mallaig
and Ullapool. Tickets for that hopscotch are around £30 ($56) per
passenger and £150 ($278) for a car. 
CalMac offices in the region include Armadale, Skye (% 01471-
844-248); Craignure, Mull (% 01680-812-343); and Stornoway,
Lewis (% 01851-702-361). You can find contact information for
other local offices on the Web site. 
You are not allowed to take a vehicle onto some of the smaller
islands, such as Iona, for example.
 By train: First ScotRail (% 0845-748-4950; www.first
scotrail.com) runs trains to the Kyle of Lochalsh (terminating
near the Skye Bridge), Mallaig, and Oban. From the latter two, you
can get connecting ferries to the islands. Regular passenger trains
don’t run on the islands. On Mull, however, a narrow gauge train
runs the short trip from Craignure to Torosay Castle (% 01680-
812-494; www.mullrail.co.uk).
 By bus: From Glasgow, Scottish Citylink (% 0141-332-9644 or
0870-550-5050; www.citylink.co.uk) runs buses to ferry ports
Chapter 19: Hebridean Islands 369

such as Oban and Ullapool. After you reach the islands, buses are
controlled by local authorities and by private companies. The serv-
ice is not as good as it perhaps should be (or once was), but get a
local timetable and you’ll get by just fine by leaving the driving to
someone else.
 By car: You can drive onto Skye over the bridge at the Kyle of
Lochalsh, on the A87, which is the main road on the Isle of Skye, as
well. On Mull, the main road is the A849, which links Tobermory to
Fionnophort via the ferry port at Craignure. Otherwise, it is mostly
one-lane (single-track) roads, many of which are twisting and turn-
ing. Take your time and exercise caution, especially as the locals
will know the roads like their proverbial palms and will travel at
speeds that you should not consider imitating. The smallest of the
islands don’t allow tourists in cars at all, making them all the more
tranquil.
 By plane: The main airport is on Lewis (call Highlands & Islands
Airports Ltd. at % 01851-707-400), about 6.4km (4 miles) east of
Stornoway. You can arrange to fly there from Inverness, Edinburgh,
or Glasgow. A nonstop flight from Glasgow typically is about one
hour long. There are some interisland flight services connecting
Barra, Benbecula (part of North Uist), and Stornoway — but it’s not
necessary to fly. Taking a ferry is part of the enjoyment of travel on
the Hebrides.
Spending the Night
Because the islands have limited dining and drinking options, the
accommodations listed in this section tend to include those where food
and drink are part of the package. The larger islands offer more accom-
modations options; you should contact local tourist offices if you want
to spend the night on a smaller island. Breakfast is included except
where otherwise noted. See Chapter 8 for an explanation of the star rat-
ings given by VisitScotland.com — also known as the Scottish Tourist
Board — and for suggestions on self-catering cottages, which are a pos-
sible option on any island tour.
Remember that hotels, large and small, may open seasonally on the
Hebrides, so always phone in advance if you’re traveling between
October and Easter. Better to confirm that they’ll take you in rather than
showing up unannounced.
Finally, have a look at “Dining locally,” where I have highlighted which
restaurants also have overnight rooms.

Ardhasaig House
$$–$$$
Ardhasaig, Harris
This small, four-star hotel is fairly remote, but the reward for making it
here is the view of the nearby bay and mountains. The building dates to
1904, but the bar lounge is surprisingly modern. Dining at Ardhasaig is usu-
ally a real treat; the menu changes pretty much daily, emphasizing what is
fresh and locally available, such as pan-fried Harris scallops or fillet of
venison. The six overnight rooms are comfortably if basically furnished
(no TVs) and some include antique furniture, while all have views either
of the hills or of the sea. In 2004, the old stone barn was converted into a
self-contained suite with a king-size sleigh bed and sheepskin rugs.
See map p. 371. Off the A859, 5km (3 miles) northwest of Tarbert. % 01859-502-066.
Fax: 01859-502-077. www.ardhasaig.co.uk. Rack rates: £110 ($204) double. MC, V. 
Ardvasar Hotel
$$–$$$
Ardvasar, Skye
This lovely hotel (one of the oldest on Skye), pub, and restaurant is a good
bet for a stay in the southern part of the island. Near the Armadale ferry ter-
minal (sailings to/from Mallaig), the lodge sits on the edge of the Sound of
Sleat. The comfortable ten rooms (three are spacious “superior” class) have
lovely views of the water or the rugged landscape of the island’s interior.
The food is about as good as it gets in the area, and the pub bustles with
grinning locals: It has been described as the hub of the local community.
See map p. 373. Just off the A851. % 01471-844-223. Fax: 01471-844-495. www.
ardvasarhotel.com. Rack rates: £100 ($185) double; £150 ($278) double with
dinner. MC, V.
Argyll Hotel
$$–$$$
Iona
This environmentally conscientious hotel, dedicated to minimizing its
impact on the fragile small island ecology, was originally built in 1868 as
the village inn. The outstanding and obliging hospitality more than com-
pensates for some smallish overnight units. But why hang out in your bed-
room when you can spend time exploring Iona or relaxing in the Argyll’s
lounges, which face the water? The package that includes dinner is 
recommended — not least because the ingredients in your meal are actu-
ally grown in the hotel’s own organic garden. Bargain hunters can opt for a
small double room with no en suite bathroom. For green tourists, the Argyll
is a must, but even non-ecologically minded visitors will enjoy a stay here. 
See map p. 371. 183m (600 ft.) from the pier. % 01681-700-334. Fax: 01681-700-510.
www.argyllhoteliona.co.uk. Rack rates: £84–£152 ($155–$281) double includ-

Cabarfeidh Hotel
$$$
Stornoway, Lewis
On Lewis, this fine modern accommodation (built in the 1970s) is located
in the middle of a 3.2-hectare (8-acre) garden just outside of Stornoway’s
town center. Despite its recent vintage, there have been several refurbs to
the Cabarfeidh, the latest in spring 2007. The rooms are large and well
upholstered, and the service usually comes up trumps, too. The hotel’s
Manor Restaurant specializes in local seafood.

See map p. 373. Manor Park, Perceval Road South, north of the town center.

Cuillin Hills Hotel
$$$
Portree, Skye
Just outside Portree, this 19th-century hunting lodge features excellent
views of the bay below and Cuillin crags in the distance. The four-star hotel
has about two-dozen rooms and is equally popular with hikers, birders,
and sportsmen — the comfort and friendliness appeal to everyone. The
conservatory is the place to relax, while the rooms are full of quality fur-
niture and generally have large bathrooms. The hotel’s restaurant earns
praise for its seafood and Highland game dishes.
See map p. 373. Off the A855, just north of town, Portree. % 01478-612-003. Fax:
01478-613-092. www.cuillinhills-hotel-skye.co.uk. Rack rates: £120–£230
($222–$426) double. AE, MC, V.
Dunollie Hotel
$$
Broadford, Skye
The Dunollie (part of the Swallow hotel chain that went belly up in summer
2006) sits on the old harbor wall in Broadford, with views across the Inner
Sound of Raasay towards the Applecross hills of mainland Scotland. The
84-unit hotel, all en suite with TVs, serves as a good holiday base from
which to explore the Isle of Skye. It’s popular with organized bus tours, too. 
See map p. 373. On the A87 (about 8km/5 miles east of the Skye Bridge). % 01471-
822-253. Fax: 01471-822-060. www.british-trust-hotels.com. Rack rates: £95
($176) double. MC, V.
Harris Hotel
$$–$$$
Tarbert, Harris
You can’t find a much more convenient location on Harris than this 24-
room hotel near the ferry terminal. The pretty, white-washed building,
built in 1865, has modern décor, a comfortable selection of accommoda-
tions (including a pair of family rooms), a large garden, and a spacious res-
ident’s lounge. One guest, Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie, mischievously
etched his initials in a dining room window.

Hotel Eilean Iarmain
$$$
Isleornsay, Skye
The Eilean Iarmain (also known as the Isle Ornsay Hotel) combines quin-
tessential Highland hospitality with tranquility and beautiful surroundings.
Part IV: The Major Regions 
374

Many of the century-old building’s original antiques are intact, and the 12
rooms in the main building contain period furniture. The finest unit is per-
haps Te Bheag, or “Whisky One,” which contains a 19th-century canopy
bed that apparently was once used in Armadale Castle. The views of the
harbor from the lodge are picture-postcard perfect. Four suites have been
added to the converted 19th-century stable blocks. 
See map p. 373. Off the A8561. % 01471-833-332. Fax: 01471-833-275. www.eilean
iarmain.co.uk. Rack rates: £120–£210 ($222–$389) double. AE, MC, V.
The Rosedale
$$–$$$
Portree, Skye
This nice white set of former fishermen’s houses near the water’s edge in
Skye’s largest harbor is warmly decorated, giving the place a snug B&B
feel. An eccentric layout of stairs and corridors connects lounges to the
bar and restaurant. The main building has cozy rooms that are simply dec-
orated while those in another wing are more individually decorated. Most
of the units in either wing, however, overlook the harbor. Dinners normally
reflect seasonal produce.
See map p. 373. On the harbor, Beaumont Crescent, Quay Brae, Portree. % 01478-
613-131. Fax: 01478-612-531. www.rosedalehotelskye.co.uk. Rack rates:
£60–£120 ($110–$222) double. AE, MC, V. 
The Royal Hotel
$$
Portree, Skye
If only I had a £5 note for every hotel named the Royal in Scotland. This
one occupies an enviable spot just up the road from the pier. The 21
overnight rooms — recently upgraded — are comfortable: Many overlook
the harbor, some have been specifically designed for families, and room
service is provided. Another treat in this part of the world is the adjacent
gym and sauna that’s available to guests. In addition to the main Royal
restaurant, the hotel is also home to the casual eatery, Well Plaid.
See map p. 373. Bank Street, Portree. % 01478-612-525. Fax: 01478-613-198. www.
royal-hotel-skye.com. Rack rates: £91–£99 ($168–$183) double. MC, V.
St. Columba Hotel
$$
Argyll, Iona
Although it doesn’t have the character and charm of the Argyll (see its list-
ing earlier in this chapter), St. Columba’s setting near Iona Abbey (see “The
top attractions” later in this chapter) never leaves you at a loss for pretty
views of the sea. A converted and expanded church manse dating from
1846, the community-owned hotel has some large and well-furnished
rooms, including four for families (and, unusually, nine singles). Like the
Argyll, it too has a vegetable and herb garden following organic standards,
although the volume of guests and diners can quickly exhaust their sup-
plies in the high season. Let them know when your ferry gets in and some-
one might come down and pick up your luggage.

Sligachan Hotel
$$
Sligachan, Skye
This 22-room hotel was built in the 1830s and retains much of its original
stonework, a classic look that complements the impressive location near
the feet of the Cuillin Hills. Most of the rooms (recently refurbished and
several with showers and bathtubs) have a view (choose between the loch
and the hills), and four are suitable for families. Located in the middle of
Skye, the Sligachan is convenient for visiting most parts of the island. The

Tigh Dearg Hotel
$$–$$$
Lochmaddy, North Uist
Only open since September 2005, and receiving a coveted four-star small
hotel rating (personally delivered by the head of Scotland’s tourist board,
no less) in spring 2006, Tigh Dearg Hotel offers rather luxurious accom-
modation in a place where you would not necessarily expect it. In addition
to the designer overnight rooms with modern details and plush acces-
sories, the hotel includes a restaurant, gym, sauna, and steam room. And
it all overlooks Lochmaddy Bay. Honestly, I’ve not been yet, but this one
is high on my list the next time I get to the Outer Hebrides.

Tobermory Holidays
$–$$
Tobermory, Mull
This combination B&B and self-catering facility is up on the hill near the golf
club, away from the harbor, but it suffers none for its quiet location in a res-
idential area on the edge of the village. Situated behind an old stone home
(Ach-na-Craoibh House), the converted barn has a host of apartments with
kitchens, as well as two double rooms with en suite bathrooms. As long as
you’re not checking out at 7 a.m. (as I had to on my last visit), guests in the
“garden rooms” can order breakfast the night before and have it delivered
by one of the gracious owners. The grounds include a children’s play area.

Tobermory Hotel
$$–$$$
Tobermory, Mull
All the buildings at the harbor in Tobermory are brightly painted in pastel
colors, and the soft pink Tobermory Hotel is no exception. These con-
verted fishermen’s cottages on the waterfront contain 15 overnight rooms
(all en suite) and one double room with a separate bathroom. The hotel’s
“superior” double rooms all overlook Tobermory Bay and feature king-size
beds. Its Water’s Edge restaurant is gaining a reputation for highlighting
excellent local produce, whether Isle of Mull cheese made just outside
town (see “Shopping” later in this chapter), Glengorm lamb, or shellfish
landed at the pier.

Western Isles Hotel
$$$
Tobermory, Mull
Fans of the great black-and-white movie I Know Where I’m Going! (see
“Recommended movies” in Chapter 2) should recognize this hotel on the
hill above Tobermory. A Victorian stone-front building overlooking the bay,
it offers old-world charm, although it does get mixed reviews from guests
and may be in need of upgrading. Nevertheless, the hotel occupies a desir-
able spot, and several rooms have vistas of the harbor below, though the
best views are from the conservatory or summer veranda.

Dining Locally
Few restaurants on the Hebridean Islands can thrive independently of a
hotel (there often are not enough locals to keep them in business), so
most of your dining options are likely to come from the previous section,
such as at the Argyll Hotel on Iona or the Water’s Edge in the Tobermory
Hotel. However, a few other restaurants stand out — and I have also
noted where they have overnight accommodations, too.
Although it isn’t listed below, you might try the fish and chip van at
Tobermory harbor — it produces possibly the best “fish suppers” in all
of Scotland.
The Chandlery Seafood Restaurant

Portree, Skye
MODERN SCOTTISH/FRENCH
One-time Scottish restaurant of the year, the Chandlery (in the Bosville
Hotel) specializes in seafood and game dishes. Occupying a lovely spot
overlooking Portree harbor, the place has an airy feel. Service is efficient
Chapter 19: Hebridean Islands 377

and professional, serving up treats from Chef John Kelly such as hand-
dived scallops from Loch Silgachan or fresh langoustines landed at Portree
harbor. Signature dishes include a smoked ham hock and Mallaig monk-
fish terrine or seared loin of Highland lamb.

Broadford, Skye
SEAFOOD/MEDITERRANEAN
This simply decorated bistro on the edge of the village of Broadford, not
far from the Skye Bridge, is not interested in snobbery. However informal
it may appear in looks and attitude, the food can be outstanding. In addi-
tion to the house specialty, Cajun seafood gumbo, there are Mediterranean-
influenced meals and more-familiar Scottish dishes such as prawn cocktail,
fried haddock, pan-roasted sea bass, or wild venison.

Gruline, Mull
SCOTTISH
Dinners at this small five-star B&B in the middle of Mull have an excellent
reputation. They’re generally only served by prior arrangement if you’re
not staying here, so don’t consider dropping in for a bite as I once fool-
ishly did. Dishes, such as pan-fried scallop of venison or prawn tails in
garlic cream sauce, are made from mostly local produce. If you desire wine,
you must bring your own. No children younger than 16, either.

which extends to the art on the walls. Near St. Clement’s Church (see “The
top attractions,” later in this chapter) at the southern end of the Isle of
Harris, the restaurant features dishes such as a salad of local prawns and
crabmeat, Lewis mussels steamed in white wine, pave of Minch cod, or pan-

Colbost, Skye
SCOTTISH
This white-washed shoreside restaurant (with six luxury overnight rooms)
is arguably the most popular on Skye — and probably the most famous in
the Hebrides. Using superb Scottish produce, owners Eddie and Shirley
Spear offer top-quality seafood and Highland game dishes from menus that
change seasonally. Dishes might include brochette of scallops and monk-
fish wrapped in Ayrshire bacon or whole roast Skye lobster with lemon-
thyme butter.

Exploring the Hebrides
From the spiritual mecca of Iona to the sandy beaches of Harris, not 
to mention the many ancient and royal attractions in between, the
Hebridean Islands offer quite a lot, with no shortage of natural beauty.
Indeed, the islands are attractions in themselves, but you’ll find plenty
to see besides the scenery.
The biggest island of the inner Hebrides is the Isle of Skye. Thanks to a
controversial bridge (well, the toll was controversial at least), visitors
can drive onto it at Kyle of Lochalsh. Your other option is to take a ferry
from the mainland harbor of Mallaig, at the end of the road. Eighty-one
kilometers (50 miles) long and 37km (23 miles) wide, Skye offers memo-
rable landscapes, historic attractions, and a good deal of accommoda-
tion and dining options. Portree is the main town on Skye.
Closer to central Scotland, and thus perhaps more accessible, is the Isle
of Mull, home to the picturesque port of Tobermory, a few castles,
plenty of scenery, and the added value of little sister island Iona. Mull
has a reputation for being the rainiest of the Hebridean Islands, but on
my visits, I have not found it noticeably wetter. After you arrive in
Chapter 19: Hebridean Islands 379

Craignure (which has little to offer other than the nearby castles of
Duart and Torosay), you can either head north to Tobermory or west
toward Fionnphort to catch the ferry to the Isle of Iona. Give yourself an
hour no matter which way you decide to go — the highway turns into a
single-lane road in either direction. Tobermory, the largest town on Mull,
is worth a visit. Brightly painted houses and storefronts in pastel shades
of blue, red, and yellow give Tobermory the look of a little Copenhagen
and the feel of an Italian fishing village. 
To see Mull and Iona in a day, Bowman’s Tours (ferry and coach) run
from Oban from April through October. Fares are around £30 ($56). Call
% 01631-566-809 or log on to www.bowmanstours.co.uk for more
information.
Beyond Skye are the connected islands of Lewis and Harris (the latter
being famous for its tweed), forming the largest island in the Outer
Hebrides. You’ll likely arrive either at the ferry terminals in Tarbert (a
common name in western Scotland that essentially means isthmus) or
further north in Stornoway, the administrative capital of the Western
Isles. The southern coastal drive on Harris is an attraction in itself — a
rocky and barren landscape transforms into a Gulf Stream miracle of
bleached beaches and blue waters. 
Some of the other islands — Barra, Coll, Eigg, Rhum, and North and
South Uist — are smaller and sparsely populated, though a few can pro-
vide visitors with easy day-trip opportunities for a wee taste of island life.
The top attractions
Armadale Castle Gardens & Museum of the Isles
Armadale, Skye
The Armadale estate, on the sound of Sleat in southern Skye, covers more
than 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres). It traditionally belonged to the clan
Donald or Macdonald, known as the Lords of Isles, but now held in trust.
The old castle is in ruins but it still occupies a magnificent spot with 19th-
century woodland gardens, nature trails, and sea views. It isn’t difficult to
understand the allure of this place. The museum, opened in 2002, is full of
information about the historically significant clan, at one time as powerful
as Scottish royalty. The castle grounds are home to a large variety of dif-
ferent trees and plants, all flourishing thanks to the Gulf Stream’s warm-
ing effects. Allow about two hours.

The Black House
Arnol, Lewis
A Historic Scotland property, this attraction steps back a hundred years or
so to depict traditional island living. Built in 1885 and occupied until 1964,
the “black house” is a traditional Hebridean stone, turf, and thatched-roof
structure, which served as both home and barn. Visitors are free to poke
around and the information center gives more background on a lost way
of life; the displays don’t paint a particularly pretty picture of what was
rather rough living. 
The peat fire has been known in the past to sometimes fill the house with
smoke, but that’s the cost of authenticity. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 371. Off the A858 (about 18km/11 miles northwest of Stornoway). 
% 01851-710-395. www.historic-scotland.gov.uk. Admission: £4.50 ($8.30)

9:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Butt of Lewis
Lewis
High cliffs overlooking the ocean are the principal reward for making it to
the northern tip of Lewis. You see seabirds, seals, and spectacular wind-
blown waves crashing against the rocks. The only significant building here
is a proud lighthouse, constructed by the Stevenson family, which adds to
the scene. Look for the large hole in the ground near the parking area;
legend has it that the Vikings dug the hole in an attempt to drag the island
back to Norway with them. Allow about one hour here.
See map p. 371. Follow the A857 to the end of the line.
Calanais Standing Stones
Lewis
Sometimes known as the “Scottish Stonehenge,” this ancient cross-shaped
formation of large stones is the most significant archaeological find of its kind
in the region. There’s no charge to see the stones, which were erected some-
time around 3000 B.C., but you may want to pay the modest fee to see the
“Story of the Stones” exhibit within the visitor center. If you’re here during the
summer solstice, you may find tents pitched near the monoliths — Calanais
has become a popular spot for New Agers to celebrate the longest day of the
year. Allow 11⁄2 hours.

Cuillin Hills
Near Broadford, Skye
These dark and massive hills — craggy enough to pass for mountains —
are a point of pride for the residents of Skye. Considered some of the best
climbing and hiking in Scotland, the 900-m (3,000-ft.) peaks rise in the
center of the island. 
You might consider spending an afternoon walking amid the spectacular
scenery, but if you’re inexperienced, inquire about professional guides at
the tourist office in Portree. A private company called Walkabout Scotland
organizes multiday guided hiking tours (call % 0845 686 1344 or log on
to www.walkaboutscotland.com). Allow three to six hours.

Brittle, south of Merkadale off the A863.
Doune Broch (Dun Carloway)
Carloway, Lewis
Up the road from the Calanais Standing Stones (see above), this intriguing
stone ruin (a “broch” was a tower used for defensive purposes and/or as
a home) from the Iron Age is in remarkably sound condition — good
enough for you to walk into, at least. Properly called Dun Carloway, the
broch provides some insight into prehistory. It wasn’t all bad back then,
either: Regardless of the weather outside, stepping into the broch provides
surprisingly effective protection from the elements. Allow 11⁄2 hours.

Duart Castle
Near Craignure, Mull
Fans of the entertaining 1945 film I Know Where I’m Going! (See
“Recommended movies” in Chapter 2) should recognize the drawing room
in this fine castle. Overlooking the Sound of Mull and clearly seen from the
Oban ferry, Duart was abandoned in 1751. Thanks to the efforts of Fitzroy
Maclean, it was completely restored from ruins in 1911. When you’re
inside, make your way up the narrow, twisting stairs and you can walk out-
side on the parapet at the top of the castle. As the ancestral home of the
clan Maclean, one floor is devoted to clan history, with various references
to the 17th-century battle cry: “Another for Hector!” Today, Duart Castle
remains the home for the clan chief. There are no special gardens to tour,
but visiting the grounds is free. 
Note that at the time of writing, Duart’s eccentric habit was to close Friday
and Saturday (except Easter weekend). Allow 11⁄2 hours.

Dunvegan Castle
Dunvegan, Skye
The seat of the Macleod chiefs, this is said to be Scotland’s oldest castle
to be continually owned and occupied by the same family, going on 800
years now. In addition to antiques, oil paintings, rare books, and clan heir-
looms — some dating to the Middle Ages — have a look at the legendary
Fairy Flag, a relic thought to bring “miraculous powers” to the clan. Also
displayed are personal items belonging to Bonnie Prince Charlie, plus
there’s a reasonably creepy dungeon. After you take in the castle and its
impressive gardens — and especially if you have kids —take a short seal
boat ride (separate admission). If you don’t see a seal, they’ll refund your
money. Allow at least two hours.

mid-Mar 11 a.m.–4 p.m.
Eigg
The Isle of Eigg lies not far off west coast of Scotland and can be reached
from either Mallaig or Arisaig. The latter offers summer cruises (on the
Sheerwater), which often have the bonus of whale-sightings on the hour-
long ride. In 1997, the inhabitants made history and set up a trust to buy
the island. Visitors can take a variety of walks on the island, including the
slightly strenuous hike up An Sgurr (the notch), the largest exposed piece
of pitchstone in the U.K. The hike takes about two hours. An easier trek is
to see chapel ruins on Kildonan Bay. A small tea room and place to rent
bicycles are located at the small pier. Eigg is close enough to Arisaig that
you can easily make a day trip of it and get a small dose of island life. For
information on sailings from Arisaig, log on to www.arisaig.co.uk or call
% 01687-450-224. Allow 61⁄2 hours.
See map p. 371. West of Arisaig. www.isleofeigg.org.
Iona Abbey
Iona
This spiritual landmark is a significant shrine to the early days of
Christianity in Scotland. This settlement (of both historic and sacred
value) was established on Iona by St. Columba, a Celtic pilgrim from
Ireland. Columba almost single-handedly brought religion to a pagan land
in the sixth century. The large abbey standing here today is in very good
shape, having undergone several restorations since the 13th century.
Crosses laid into the abbey floor mark the graves of several monks, while
there are impressive medieval crosses on the grounds. The cemetery has
graves of early Scottish royals and chiefs. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
You can see Iona in one day, although overnight stays are quite relaxing
on this tiny island.

North and South Uist
Although no single attraction on North and South Uist (pronounced yewst)
necessarily stands out, these two islands, part of an archipelago, are worth
a visit. Certainly consider it if you’re on Lewis and Harris or even in north-
west Skye (from where the ferry crossing out of Uig takes just under two
hours). Devote at least a full day to cross the rural landscape and take in
the scenery, landmarks, and fresh air. Be sure to get off the main road, too,
at least occasionally, to explore the rural lanes that get closer to the sea.
At the Balranald Nature Reserve, you can spot many types of wading birds
and other sea life, while the Kildonan Museum and Heritage Centre covers
local culture, history, and archaeological finds. You can drive through the
Uists, via the isle of Benbecula, using the man-made causeways, but buses
(Westen Isles Bus Services) also run the length of the islands. It is only
about 82km (51 miles) from Lochmaddy south to Lochboisdale. Allow at
least eight hours.

St. Clement’s Church
Rodel, Harris
Is it worth traveling to the southern tip of Harris to see this far-flung attrac-
tion? Aye, it pretty much is. At the end of an amazing coastal route full of
white beaches and aqua-blue waters, you arrive at this small but well-pre-
served early 16th-century pre-Reformation church. It is certainly the best
of its type in the Western Isles, following a cruciform plan with a square
tower at one end. The most impressive feature, aside from the intact stone
edifice itself, is the carved tomb of Alexander MacLeod of Dunvegan (aka
Alasdair Crotach), who had it done well before he died in the late 1540s.
Protected from the elements and literally built into the church, it is a
remarkably well-preserved bit of medieval craftsmanship. There are other
startling details elsewhere, including a carving of St. Clement and curiously
naked woman. Allow one hour.
See map p. 371. On the A859, Rodel. Admission: free. Open: daily dawn–dusk.
Skye Museum of Island Life and Flora MacDonald’s Grave
Kilmuir, Skye
The place where Flora MacDonald was born is marked on South Uist. On
Skye, if you follow a path from the Museum of Island Life to Kilmuir
Cemetery, you can see the Victorian era memorial marking the grave of
the legendary Flora. In case you don’t know, she is credited with saving
Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746. The Young Pretender hid on Skye with her
help after the battle of Culloden and escaped disguised as MacDonald’s
Part IV: The Major Regions 
384

maid. Poor Flora was later arrested as an accessory and held in the Tower
of London. Later, she moved to North Carolina and finally back to Skye
before she died. The locally run “museum” actually consists of a set of
thatched croft (small-holding) houses, showing how people lived on Skye
a century or more ago. The re-created crofts contain antique domestic
items, agricultural tools, and photographs of island life. Allow one hour.
See map p. 373. On the A855, take the A87 north from Portree to Uig. % 01470-552-

students, and children younger than 16. Open: Apr–Oct generally Mon–Sat 
9 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Staffa and Fingal’s Cave
Just a short boat trip from Mull, the uninhabited Isle of Staffa is an attrac-
tion worth seeing if you’re spending time in the Mull-Iona area. Visitors
enjoy watching the sea crash against the dramatic, vertical rock forma-
tions, especially the cathedral-like columns of Fingal’s Cave. The cave is
one of the natural wonders of the world and is famous for being the inspi-
ration for Mendelssohn’s Hebridean Overture. Birders, take note: Staffa is
home to a large puffin colony. Unfortunately, in the midseason, some of
the boats won’t sail if they don’t get enough reservations. Different serv-
ices offer trips to Staffa: The MB Iolaire (% 01681-700-358) departs from
both Fionnphort (on Mull where the ferry for Iona sets off) and from Iona
daily, allowing passengers one hour ashore; tickets are £18 ($33) for adults
and £7.50 ($14) for children. Turus Mara (% 0800-858-786 or 01688-400-242;
www.turusmara.com) departs from Ulva Ferry, on the west coast of central
Mull. Excursions are generally available from Easter through September and
the Turus Mara Staffa trip costs about the same as sailing on the Iolaire.

Torosay Castle and Gardens
Near Craignure, Mull
Compared to nearby Duart Castle, Torosay is a relatively modern house,
built in the Victorian era. Access to the interiors here is more limited, too,
because most of the building is still used as a private home. But whatever
the restrictions indoors, the surrounding gardens are the real attraction
for many visitors. The 4.8 hectares (12 acres) of well-manicured grounds
abound with fine and unique flora, Romanesque statues, and ivy-covered
walls. You’re welcome to explore the greenhouse and are encouraged to
stop and smell the roses; this stop is a treat for anyone with a green thumb.
Photography buffs will appreciate the views of the Sound of Mull and back-
ground mountains, and children usually enjoy the small-scale train that
runs to Torosay from Craignure. Allow 11⁄2 hours.

Western Isles Museum (Museum nan Eilean)
Stornoway, Lewis
This museum is home to exhibits on various aspects of island life, history,
and archeology, deploying objects, photographs, prints, and paintings. The
displays, often borrowed from other museums and collections around the
islands and the Scottish mainland, are of excellent quality and significant
historical importance. This museum is definitely worth a visit — and you
can’t beat the price. Allow 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 371. Francis Street, Stornoway. % 01851-709-266. Admission: free. Open:
Apr–Sept Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar Tues–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–1 p.m.
Other cool things to see and do
 Ardalanish Farm & Isle of Mull Weavers, off the A849 near
Bunessan, Mull (% 01681-700-265. www.isleofmullweavers.
co.uk). This organic farm on the Ross of Mull doesn’t mind visi-
tors. In fact, you’re welcome to see how a demonstration organic
farm works. In addition to self-guided walks, the weavers offer bun-
dled yarn and tweed by the yard. 
 Aros (the Home of Culture and Hospitality), just south of Portree
on the A87 (% 01478-613-649. www.aros.co.uk). This cultural
center on the Isle of Skye has an art gallery, shops, cafe, and is a
venue for music, drama, and films. 
 Aros Castle, off the A848 (about 3km/2 miles north of Salen), Isle of
Mull. The castle is a monumental pile of rocks in the shape of a
ruined tower house, on a hill overlooking Salen Bay. But it was once
a stronghold of the MacDougalls and the Lords of the Isles. The
ruins, at least during my last visit, were not fenced off.
 Mull Theatre, Tobermory, Mull (% 01688-302-828; www.mull
theatre.com). This surprisingly accomplished dramatic company
tours Scotland and performs at its own new facility opened in early
2007 outside Tobermory.
 Skye Serpentarium, on the A850 near Broadford, Skye (% 01471-
822-209; www.skyeserpentarium.org.uk). This place is crazy
about their collection of reptiles and amphibians, many of which
were seized (while being smuggled into the country) by customs
officials and sent to this serpentarium for the good life.
 Talisker Distillery, off the A863, Carbost, Skye (% 01478-614-308).
As whisky distillery visits go, Talisker’s tour is among the best.
Enthusiastic guides expound on the virtues of their single malt
whisky (the only one produced on Skye) and its production
process. 
 Tobermory Distillery, Tobermory, Mull (% 01688-302-645). The
only distillery on Mull, Tobermory produces five different single
malts with unpeated malted barley (not typical of island whisky). A
visitor center is located on the premises.
Part IV: The Major Regions 
386

 Ulva is the small isle located just across a narrow straight from the
settlement of Ulva Ferry (off the B8073) in west-central Mull. During
the Clearances from about 1840 to 1882, when thousands of Scots
were evicted from their homes, Ulva’s population went from about
850 to less than 60 — and the remaining residents were forced to
live in one small corner near the ferry slip called Desolation Point.
A cafe serving fresh oysters almost by itself merits the ferry ride to
Ulva, but the isle is excellent for walking, too.
Shopping the Hebridean Islands
Despite their remoteness, the Hebridean Islands are home to a fair
number of excellent craft and specialty shops.
 Edinbane Pottery, off the A850, between Portree and Dunvegan,
Skye (% 01470-582-234; www.edinbane-pottery.co.uk). This
workshop and gallery produces some unique and mostly hand-
thrown salt-glazed ceramics. Open Easter to October daily from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Isle of Mull Cheese, Sgriob-Ruadh Farm, near Tobermory, Mull 
(% 01688-302-235; www.isleofmullcheese.co.uk). This farm
produces award-winning, artisan cheeses using only cow’s and
ewe’s milk produced on the premises. Delicious. Open May to
September daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 Isle of Mull Silver & Goldsmiths, Main Street, Tobermory, Mull 
(% 01688-302-345; www.mullsilver.co.uk). Part manufacturer,
part retail shop, this little jewelry store makes pieces in-house and
has an impressive selection from across Scotland. The shop is open
Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m.
Hours may be extended in the summer.
 Over the Rainbow, Portree, Skye (% 01478-612-555; www.skye-
knitwear.com). This shop is stocked with colorful knits of first-
rate quality, whether sweaters, scarves, or blankets. The shop also
sells designer jewelry and accessories. Open daily from 9 a.m. to 9
p.m. in the summer and daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the off
season.
 Tobermory Handmade Chocolate, Main Street, Tobermory, Mull
(% 01688-302-526; www.tobchoc.co.uk). This chocolatier makes
unique handmade confections locally, whether 71 percent pure
dark-chocolate treats (such as a rum truffle) or after-dinner mints.
Open March to October Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to
5 p.m., Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in July and August.
Chapter 19: Hebridean Islands 387

Doing the Pub Crawl
Many of the inns and restaurants listed at the beginning of this chapter
offer pub life, too. Below are a few more to consider. Call for the latest
opening and closing times.
 Isles Inn, Somerled Square, Portree, Skye (% 01478-612-129). This
cozy, friendly pub (with overnight rooms) in the center of Portree
is a popular joint featuring traditional music most nights, especially
in the summer. 
 Martyr’s Bay, near the pier, Iona (% 01681-700-382). This bar (and
restaurant) has sea views and is named for the nearby inlet where
some 68 monks were killed by Vikings in the 9th century. 
 Mishnish, Main Street, Tobermory, Mull (% 01688-302-009). This
quayside pub (with overnight rooms) is rather big for such a
diminutive town. There are two main areas, with a warming fire-
place, as well as “snugs” (small rooms) for a little more privacy.

Orkney and Shetland
Islands
In This Chapter
 Uncovering accommodations and restaurants on the islands
 Discovering prehistoric sites and settlements
M
aking the trip to the northern island groups of Orkney and
Shetland can be rewarding but if you do plan to visit either archi-
pelago, you should know that getting there does take some extra effort.
But should you reach these islands, you will discover that they abound
with grand views, old ruins, and a heritage unlike the rest of Scotland.
Given the long ribbon of history, they arguably have as much in common
with Scandinavia as Scotland. The location is so far north that midsum-
mer nights get no darker than twilight. As far as the weather’s concerned,
these islands can feel chilly with a steady breeze often blowing. Yet
given how far north they are, these nearly flat isles should be a lot
colder. Winter offers scant sunlight and often brings snow. 
Visitors will find that accommodation, dining, shopping, and drinking
options are more limited in such northern latitudes. In the off season,
the quiet gets even quieter. Keep in mind that although the Orkney and
Shetland islands offer an escape from the crowds, in many ways you’re
escaping conveniences, too.
Kirkwall is the main town in the Orkneys, where the ferries from Aber-
deen arrive. To the east is Stromness, another key port village, where
ferries arrive from the northern Scottish mainland city of Scrabster near
Thurso. In Shetland, Lerwick is the administrative capital and largest
port town, receiving ferries from Aberdeen, Kirkwall, and in summer
from Bergen, Norway, too. Shetland is also today a major terminus for
pipelines from the North Sea oil platforms.
Given the limited tourist offerings on the islands, I keep this chapter
short and succinct, combing the accommodation and dining options into
one section. For greater details, contact the local tourist information
centers. For Orkney, call the Kirkwall center (% 01856-872-856) or log

on to www.visitorkney.com. For Shetland, call the Lerwick center 
(% 08701-999-440) or go to the Web site www.visitshetland.com.
Getting There
For many travelers, the simplest way to see the islands is to join a tour
that covers the major sights in the area. If you’re not on a tour, you can
get to both Orkney and Shetland by ferry or by airplane. The major
islands of the groups have ferry services that connect them to one
another.
 By ferry: NorthLink Ferries (% 0845-600-0449; www.northlink
ferries.co.uk) operates services from the mainland to Orkney
and Shetland, either from Scrabster to Stromness or Aberdeen to
Kirkwall. Typical fares range from around £13 ($24) to £24 ($44) per
adult (plus vehicle fee), depending on the route and the time of
year. The trip from Scrabster to Stromness in Orkney takes about
21⁄4 hours; the overnight journey from Aberdeen to Lerwick in
Shetland takes 121⁄2 hours. 
Smaller companies also run boats to Orkney. Summer passenger-
only ferries run by John O’Groats Ferries (% 01955-611-353; www.
jogferry.co.uk) go from John O’Groats to Burwick (May–Sept, 40
minutes). Pentland Ferries (% 01856-831-226; www.pentland
ferries.co.uk) travel from Gills Bay to St. Margaret’s Hope (one
hour).
 By car: If you’ve rented a car for your time in Scotland, you can
take it with you when you visit Orkney by booking passage on one
of the NorthLink Ferries. You can make arrangements with many
car-rental agencies for free vehicle pick-up and delivery at ferry
landings and airports in Scotland.
 By plane: Kirkwall Airport (% 01856-872-421) is about 5km (3
miles) from the center of Kirkwall, Orkney. Sumburgh Airport 
(% 01950-461-000) is 40km (25 miles) south of Lerwick on Shet-
land. Both airports are operated by Highlands and Islands Airports
(% 01667-462-445; www.hial.co.uk). There is regular if not nec-
essarily frequent nonstop service to Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edin-
burgh, and Inverness; some flights from London go via a Scottish
mainland airport. For example, a flight from Inverness to Kirkwall
can take about 45 minutes and cost between £60 and £100 ($111–
$185). A direct flight from London to Sumburgh takes about 13⁄4
hours and costs in the range of £100 to £220 ($185–$407).

Spending the Night and Dining Locally
Your choices of accommodations and restaurants are more limited on
Orkney and Shetland. I’ve tried to give you some of the better options in
this section. Hotel room prices include full breakfast unless otherwise
stated. You may well get a better deal than the advertised “rack” rates. 
I have also tried to indicate when ventures are closed throughout or
during a part of the off-season, but call in advance to confirm.

Ayre Hotel
$$
Kirkwall, Orkney
This renovated 18th-century three-star hotel overlooks Kirkwall harbor. In
addition to the friendly service, the cozy, simply decorated rooms all have
en suite bathrooms, TVs, and coffee-making equipment. The white-washed
building is conveniently located near the town center as well as by the
water. Ask for a room with a view of the sea.

Burrastow House
$$–$$$$
Near Walls, Shetland
SCOTTISH
Talk about getting away from it all. Still, if you’re planning to spend some
time on Shetland, a weekend dinner reservation at Burrastow House might
be in order. The menus feature local fish, lamb, beef, and pork — even the
cucumbers and tomatoes in your salad are likely to be grown locally. While
sheep graze on the grass outside, you’ll be grazing on mussel stew, monk-
fish, and homemade soups. If you’re looking to spend the night, Burrastow
is a four-star guesthouse with five en suite rooms.
See map p. 391. Off the A971 (5km/3 miles from Walls, 43km/27 miles west of Lerwick).

MC, V. Closed Nov–Mar.
The Creel
$$$
South Ronaldsay, Orkney
FISH/SEAFOOD
This restaurant with rooms in St. Margaret’s Hope is run by chef/owner Alan
Craigie, who was named Scottish Restaurant Chef of the Year in 2006 by the
country’s Independent Chef’s Association. For over 21 years, he and his
staff have treated guests to dishes made almost exclusively with locally
landed fish and shellfish — including some lesser seen varieties such as
megrim and torsk. There is also grass-fed Ornkey beef and lamb, which
itself dines on seaweed. There are three overnight rooms, all with sea views.
See map p. 393. Off the A961, Front Road, St. Margaret’s Hope (21km/13 miles south

Lerwick, Shetland
Located in the heart of Lerwick, only one street away from the water, the
Grand has an impressive castellated design with corbels, crow-stepped
gables, and turrets. But this old-fashioned structure has been modernized
inside. In addition to the bar and restaurant, the hotel has its own night-

Exploring Orkney and Shetland
Attraction for attraction, Orkney, given its ancient landmarks with World
Heritage Site status, has more going for it than the Shetlands. It is said
that no other northern European location can equal Orkney’s concentra-
tion of visible prehistoric monuments. The top sights are on the largest
island in the group: What locals — or Orcadians — call the Mainland.
Orkney also offers spectacular seascapes and plenty of unspoiled
nature. The quaint town of Stromness has been a natural harbor since
Viking times, and Kirkwall is the lovely capital of the island chain.
To see some of the smaller islands of Orkney, such as Hoy or Shapinsay,
Orkney Ferries (% 01856-872-044; www.orkneyferries.co.uk) offers
sailings and mini cruises.
Part IV: The Major Regions 
394

Of the more than 100 islands that make up the Shetlands, only about 15
are inhabited. Similar to Orkney, the main island is called the Mainland.
The Norse gave the island chain to Scotland through a marriage dowry
in 1469, but the legacy of its Scandinavian origins shows in the faces of
the locals, the names of villages, and the architecture of the main town,
Lerwick. Nature abounds in the beautiful scenery, from Shetland ponies
that roam freely to seals and porpoises that live along the coasts. Like
the people of Orkney, Shetland residents’ identities are probably more
strongly tied to their islands than to Scotland.
Be sure to stop at the tourist offices in Kirkwell (Orkney) and Lerwick
(Shetland) and pick up the handy maps showing both large and small
attractions.
Joining a guided tour
A guided tour can be a smart, convenient way to get around and see spe-
cific sights. Here are two to consider.
 Wildabout Orkney Tours (% 01856-851-011; www.wildabout-
orkney.co.uk) offers excursions covering the island’s prehistoric
highlights, with guides also discussing the history, archeology, and
ecology of Orkney. Those more interested in modern history can
take a tour that highlights Orkney’s role in 20th-century world
wars, while a “stones to birds” tour focuses on wildlife as well as
ancient history.
 Shetland Wildlife (% 01950-422-483; www.shetlandwildlife.
co.uk) specializes in guided tours that show off Shetland’s diverse
wildlife. It offers a selection of multiday tours, such as the “Shet-
land experience,” which combines sea cruises and overland jour-
neys in search of puffins, whales, otters, and more.
The top attractions
Get an “Explorer’s Pass” from Historic Scotland (% 0131-668-8797) for
reduced admission prices to several attractions on Orkney.
Bishop’s and Earl’s Palaces
Kirkwall, Orkney
The impressive ruins of the Bishop’s Palace date to the 12th century,
although most of what’s standing today is about 400 years more recent.
History says that King Haakon of Norway returned here to die after losing
the battle of Largs (southwest of Glasgow) in 1263. The despotic Earl
Patrick Stuart built the Earl’s Palace next door in the 1600s. Stuart, son of
a bastard step-brother to Mary Queen of Scots, treated the local subjects
rottenly, though he was ultimately executed for treason. In its day, his
palace (completed after his death) was among the finest examples of
French Renaissance architecture in Scotland. Allow about two hours.

Jarlshof
Near Sumburgh, Shetland
This prehistoric settlement was discovered after a particularly violent
storm in 1897 washed away the sand that had covered it for millennia.
Subsequent archaeological digs have further revealed settlements and
remarkable artifacts from different civilizations, from the Stone Age to the
Viking era. Highlights include an oval Bronze Age house, an Iron Age broch
(stone house and fortification) and wheelhouses, a medieval farmstead,
and the relatively modern 16th-century laird’s house. As for the Norse
sounding name, it comes courtesy of Sir Walter Scott’s The Pirate. Allow
about two hours.

Maes Howe
West Mainland, Orkney
This strange turf-covered mound dates to about 2750 B.C. and contains a
burial cairn that is probably the finest Neolithic tomb in the U.K. By some
estimates, as a prehistoric feat of engineering, it is only surpassed by the
far more famous Stonehenge in England. You’ll find a stone-built passage,
a burial chamber, and smaller cells. Look for the inscriptions along the
walls written by Vikings who pillaged the tomb’s treasures in the 12th cen-
tury. A bit of ancient Norse graffiti, if you like. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

ft.) high, quite a bit more imposing than those in the Brodgar group. The
two circles, part of the Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site, are within
walking distance of each other. Twenty-seven of the 60 stones in the Ring
of Brodgar remain standing, while only 4 of 12 at Stenness are still upright.
When the fog rolls in, the rings are quite a sight, but on any day most vis-
itors are moved by these monuments. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

St. Magnus Cathedral
Kirkwall, Orkney
Dominating the town of Kirkwall, this sandstone cathedral honors Magnus,
a Norse earl killed in the 12th century by cousin Haakon, who then went
on to become king. After Magnus was buried in Birsay, however, miracles
began occurring and he was made a saint in 1135. Magnus’s nephew, Earl
Rognvald, after a bit of crusading (and perhaps some slave-trading, too)
then initiated construction of this cathedral in 1137. Along with Glasgow’s
St. Mungo’s, it is Scotland’s only pre-Reformation cathedral substantially
intact. It retains grand features, from huge sandstone columns to beauti-
ful stained glass.

Scalloway Castle
Scalloway, Shetland
These ruins date back to the time of Earl Patrick Stuart — not a popular
figure in these parts thanks to his corruption and brutality — who built
this castellated mansion in 1600. In fact, he used forced labor to do it. After
he was executed, the building fell into disrepair, but it still makes for good
photographs. To gain access Monday to Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
get the key from Shetland Woolen Company next door. On Sunday, get it
from the nearby hotel. Allow about one hour.

Skara Brae
West Mainland, Orkney
Along with Maes Howe and the standing stones detailed above, this pre-
historic beachside village — the best of its type in northern Europe —
completes the Stone Age extravaganza of Orkney. It was exposed to
modern man only after a storm in 1850. Stone passages connect about a
half-dozen rooms, where you can see beds, fireplaces, dressers, seats, and
boxes for possessions, all carved of stone. A replica adjacent to the site
recreates what life may have been like when Skara Brae was inhabited,
while nearby Skaill House (closed in winter) offers a 17th century version
of bourgeois island accommodations. Allow about two hours.

Other Cool Things to See and Do
 Clickimin Broch, near Lerwick, Stornoway. First inhabited from
perhaps 700 to 500 B.C., this stone settlement includes the 2nd-
century oval house, as well as the ruins of earlier prehistoric build-
ings and walls, which would have enclosed livestock.
 Italian Chapel, off the A961, Isle of Lambholm, Orkney. WWII Italian
prisoners of war were brought to Orkney, and on this tiny island
between East Mainland and Burray they converted one of the cor-
rugated steel Quonset (or Nissen) huts into a place of worship with
an elaborately painted interior. Today it is one of the most visited
landmarks in Orkney.
 The Longship, 7–15 Broad St., Kirkwall, Orkney (% 01856-888-
790). This shop, founded over 150 years ago, features the jewelry
designs of Ola Gorie, as well as showing off the talents of other
Orcadian craftspeople, whether with fashion accessories, clothing,
or food.
 Mousa Broch, Mousa Island, Shetland. This is considered the best
surviving Iron Age broch, a tower of stone standing at over 13m (40
ft.) tall. Once there were some 120 of these dotted about Shetland.
To get there, boats (% 01950 431-367) leave from Sandwick on the
A970, about 22km (14 miles) south of Lerwick
 The Old Man of Hoy, Hoy, Orkney. This 137-m-tall (450-ft.) stack of
sandstone rises amid the cliffs along the western shores of Hoy. A
real challenge to rock climbers, my advice is to see it from the cliff
tops, from a touring cruise ship, or possibly from the ferry to
Stromness.
 Orkney Museum, Tankerness House, Broad Street, Kirkwall, Orkney
(% 01856-873-191). Tankerness House has an interesting little
museum that covers aspects of Orcadian life during the last 5,000
years. The building dates to 1574, when it was a residence for
church officials. Admission is free.
 Stromness Museum, 52 Alfred St., Stromness, Orkney (% 01856-
850-025). This museum focuses on maritime history, including
details about the WWI German fleet that roamed the Scapa Flow
before being scuttled and the ships of the Hudson Bay Company,
which took Orcadians to Canada.

Ten Outstanding Golf
Courses
In This Chapter
 Rubbing shoulders with the golf elite at St. Andrews
 Hitting the links on the wind-swept west coast
I
t would be unfair to say definitively that the golf courses listed in this
chapter are the ten best in Scotland. The country just has too many
great courses. You would need to golf every day for nearly a year to hit
all the courses. Each one in this chapter has its own special attraction.
Some are more famous than others; some are more difficult than others.
Remember, to play the championship courses, you need a bona fide and
acceptable handicap.
For every course, call ahead for information about tee times and require-
ments to play (if any exist).
Carnoustie
Although golfers have been playing here since 1560, somehow Carnoustie
has remained one of Scotland’s lesser-known championship courses. It’s
increasingly popular, in part because it has been the site of recent British
Open tournaments. The course has one of the toughest and longest fin-
ishes in the country.
Carnoustie, east of Dundee. Par 72. % 01241-853-789. www.carnoustie
golflinks.co.uk.
Gairloch Golf Club
It may be only 9 holes, but this course is still very much a challenging and
tricky one. Combine this challenge with a location along a golden beach
and overlooking Skye and the Hebrides and you have a great course.
Gairloch. Par 35. % 01445-712-407. www.gairlochgolfclub.com.

Muirfield
Muirfield is the best championship course near Edinburgh, and it’s regu-
larly a location for qualifying play before the British Open (which people
here just call the “Open”). If you’re not an expert, you’ll be more com-
fortable playing on one of the other courses near Gullane.
Muirfield. Par 71. % 01620-842-123. www.muirfield.org.uk.
Prestwick
The original home of the Open, this course remains a monument to the
early days of golf (1860s). It has bumpy fairways, deep bunkers, and
many blind shots, but this old-school course is well worth the time and
the challenge.
Prestwick. Par 71. % 01292-477-404. www.prestwickgc.co.uk.
Royal Dornoch Course
This course doesn’t have a single bad hole, and its only downside is its
location in the far north. You have plenty of room off the tee, but placing
your drive depends greatly upon the wind and the pin positions. The
course is challenging but accessible to nearly everyone.
Dornoch. Par 70. % 01862-810-219. www.royaldornoch.com.
Royal Troon
Despite popular belief, nonmembers (and women) aren’t prohibited
from playing this famous and fabulous course in Ayrshire on the Clyde
Coast. The course has frequently played host to the Open, and each hole
provides a challenge. The 8th hole, or “postage stamp, “ is the shortest
in Open history. If you don’t have the chops for Royal Troon, go to one
of the excellent municipal courses nearby.
Troon. Par 71. % 01292-311-555. www.royaltroon.co.uk.
St. Andrews
The Old Course at St. Andrews is arguably the most famous golf course
in the world. All the “greats” of the sport have played here, apparently
even Mary Queen of Scots. This always challenging seaside links golf

course is the one in Scotland that most frequently hosts the Open. It’s
definitely the mecca of golf, if ever there was one.
St. Andrews. Par 72. % 01334-466-666. www.standrews.org.uk.
Traigh
This is perhaps the most picturesque 9-hole course in Scotland, and pos-
sibly in Europe. Just 3.2km (2 miles) up the road from Arisaig on the old
highway, and set right along the country’s most attractive shoreline,
Traigh offers not only challenging golf (for a short course) but brilliant
views, too.
Arisaig. Par 34. % 01687-450-337. www.traighgolf.co.uk.
Turnberry
The Ailsa Course at Turnberry is home to a fair amount of Open drama;
golf heroes such as Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, and Greg Norman have
all competed for the top prize here. The links-style course that runs
along the South Ayrshire seashore, against the backdrop of the grand
Turnberry hotel, is one of the most picturesque in Scotland. Book a
room at the hotel to be guaranteed a tee time.
Turnberry. Par 72. % 01655-331-000. www.turnberry.co.uk.
Western Gailes
With its unique layout of greens tucked away in hollows, the course here
requires finesse, accuracy, and precision. This natural links-style course
hugs the coastline less than an hour’s drive from Glasgow and can be
played practically all year round, because its sandy fairways and greens
drain quickly and the weather is generally moderate (if typically windy).

 Walking the grounds of great Scottish battles
 Visiting the most impressive ecclesiastical buildings
 Discovering the most fascinating castles and prehistoric sites
I
n a country with hundreds of ancient castles and ruins, choosing just
ten of the best is certainly difficult. If you’re a history buff or get a
special charge out of walking in the footsteps of some of history’s giants,
put the attractions and locations in this chapter on your must-see list.
But for each of these, you may prefer two others; remember, these are
simply my own favorites.
Bannockburn
King Robert the Bruce beat Edward II’s English troops here in a decisive
battle that secured Scottish sovereignty after the freedom struggles
associated with William “Braveheart” Wallace. See Chapter 16 for more
on this historic area.
Near Stirling. % 01786-812-664.
Calanais Standing Stones
The “Scottish Stonehenge” is one of the most significant archaeological
finds of its kind in the entire U.K. (see Chapter 19). Much mystery sur-
rounds the purpose and origin of these stones (whose arrangement
dates back to 3000 B.C.), which remain an attraction to pilgrims who
camp out here during the summer solstice.
Isle of Lewis. % 01851-621-422.

Castle Tioram
The ruins of this ancient castle (pronounced cheer-rum) on Loch Moidart
(see Chapter 18) have one of the most romantic — and remote — settings
in the Western Highlands. Although access is limited, you can scale the
small hill upon which the castle sits and let your imagination do the rest.
Near Blain, Ardnamurchan Peninsula.
Culloden Moor Battlefield
British forces loyal to the Hanoverian king in London defeated Bonnie
Prince Charlie’s Jacobite rebellion here in 1746, ending a valiant but ulti-
mately unsuccessful movement for restoration of the Stuart crown. No
other military movement followed Charlie after his loss here. A visitor
center with museum provides the complete history of the battlefield.
Flip to Chapter 18 for more on this historical site.
Near Inverness. % 01463-790-607.
Culzean Castle
A mansion more than a castle, Culzean remains a classic example of the
work of Robert Adam, Scotland’s preeminent architect in the Georgian
era. In addition to the castle, Culzean offers lots of parkland and gardens
to explore. You can find details on Culzean and its surroundings in
Chapter 15.
South Ayrshire. % 01655-884-455.
Doune Castle
Made famous thanks to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Doune
Castle is one of the best because it has been modestly restored, giving
visitors a feel for what life in a medieval castle truly was like during the
heyday of this classic keep. See Chapter 16 for more details on Doune.
Doune, near Stirling. % 01786-841-742.
Eilean Donan Castle
After Edinburgh Castle, Eilean Donan is probably the most photographed
castle in Scotland. It has been restored and offers some interesting
exhibits as well as a good bit of history, including defending the area 
Chapter 22: Ten Can’t-Miss Castles and Historic Sites 407

from Vikings and serving as a Jacobite stronghold. See Chapter 18 for
more information on this castle.
Dornie, Kyle of Lochalsh. % 01599-555-202.
Glasgow Cathedral
Glasgow Cathedral is the oldest pre-Reformation cathedral still standing
soundly on the Scottish mainland. (Orkney has another from the same
era.) It marks the place where the earliest settlements of this industrial
powerhouse were established. Flip to Chapter 12 for details.
Townhead, Glasgow. % 0141-552-6891.
Melrose Abbey
Of all the historic abbeys in the Borders region (see Chapter 14), the 
one in Melrose may be the most interesting. Built in the 12th century, it
inspired Sir Walter Scott (who made sure it was secured) and it’s also
the place where the heart of King Robert the Bruce was buried.
Melrose, the Borders. % 01896-822-562.
Skara Brae
This prehistoric beachside village in West Mainland, Orkney, is the best
of its type in northern Europe. Stone passages link several rooms, all 
furnished in stone: from the beds (upon which its Stone Age residents
would lay straw) to fireplaces and even storage boxes. Go to Chapter 20
for details.

Ten Distinctive Distilleries
In This Chapter
 “Nosing” about for the good stuff
 Taking tours of distilleries large and small
W
hisky is undoubtedly Scotland’s best known export; a good deal
of the distilleries across the country are open to the public, many
with tours of their facilities that explain exactly how whisky is made
(and how it’s different from American or Canadian whiskeys) and teach
visitors how to “nose” Scotch properly. This chapter lists some of the
best to visit.
Caol Ila
On the isle of Islay (pronounced eye-la), Caol Ila (pronounced cull-ee-la)
has to have one of the best settings for an island whisky distillery, nes-
tled at the base of a hill at the shore just across from the isle of Jura.
While it produces single malts, it also distills spirit for Johnnie Walker’s
premium blends.
Near Pork Askaig, Isle of Islay. % 01496-302-760.
Dalwhinnie
Originally called Strathspey distillery, Dalwhinnie has the distinction of
being Scotland’s highest distillery, in elevation, at about 326m (1,073 ft.)
above sea level. The tour of this distillery is good, too, but perhaps not
on a par with either the dramatic setting, where you may see snow on
surrounding hills in early summer, or the sparkling white buildings with
their pagoda-type roofs.
Dalwhinnie. % 01540-672-219.

Edradour
Edradour is among the smallest distilleries in Scotland, putting out only
12 casks a week, and one of the last remaining so-called farm distilleries
that used to be commonplace in Perthshire. Edradour is produced by a
small staff, using traditional methods and seemingly antique equipment. 
Near Pitlochry. % 01796-472-095.
Glenfiddich
Readers who haven’t heard of Glenfiddich probably have little interest in
this chapter. Glenfiddich is one of the three biggest selling whiskies in
the world, which explains why some 125,000 visitors come here annu-
ally. It was the first distillery to recognize the potential of tourism and
open a visitor center, and it’s a good choice for those who want a well-
organized tour of a large, modern distillery.
Near Dufftown. % 01340-820-373.
Glen Grant
Beautiful gardens are a highlight of a visit to this fine Morayshire distill-
ery. After the tour, take your dram of whisky (apparently a favorite of
Italians) outside and taste it cut with a drop or two of water from the
burbling Glen Grant burn. 
Rothes, near Elgin. % 01542-783-318.
Glenlivet
The Glenlivet is among the most popular single malts sold. The tours
here have a reputation for being the most entertaining and informative
of any in Scotland. Thus, if you’re in the area and can only visit one dis-
tillery, you may want to make it this one.
Near Tomintoul. % 01542-783-220.
The Glenturret
By most accounts, this is the oldest distillery in Scotland. Illegal distilling
at this site began as early as 1717. Because visitors can quite easily get
Part V: The Part of Tens 
410

here and back in an afternoon drive from either Glasgow or Edinburgh,
Glenturret is very popular, but the staff manages to handle the crowds
adeptly. 
Near Crieff. % 01764-656-565.
Laphroaig
For fans of peaty flavors, Laphroaig from the isle of Islay — Scotland’s
whisky island — is often a preference and is perhaps the best known of
all island single malts. The taste of this whisky carries hints not only of
the local peat but of the sea air as well.
Near Port Ellen, Islay. % 01496-302-418.
Strathisla
This fine Highland single malt is better known for being the main ingredi-
ent in Chivas Regal, one of the most popular blends in the world. The
distillery tour here usually ends with an informative and unique “nosing”
of different whiskies from the various regions of Scotland.
Keith. % 01542-783-044.
Talisker
The only distillery on the rather large island of Skye, the Talisker tour is
among one of the best in the country. Talisker produces whisky with the
peaty flavor of the island. In addition to producing its own distinctive
brand, Talisker produces whisky used in popular blends such as Johnnie
Walker.

Ten Stunning Natural
Attractions
In This Chapter
 Hiking amidst beautiful mountains and glens
 Seeing sea monsters (or maybe not) at moody lochs
 Stretching out on a sandy beach next to blue seas
Yes, Scotland has a pair of vibrant cities, loads of historic monu-
ments, numerous of castles, and gobs of golf courses. But the coun-
try is also home to some of the prettiest countryside you could ever
imagine. Whether you like to hike, watch birds, or just hunt for perfect
photographic backdrops, take in as many of these top nature spots as
you can.
Ardnamurchan Peninsula
Remote but reasonably easy to reach (in contrast to Knoydart, further
north) this picturesque western Highland peninsula forms the most
westerly region of the entire British mainland. There are wind-swept
beaches and tide pools, with plenty of opportunities for hiking. Go to
Chapter 18 for details.
West of Fort William. 
Arthur’s Seat and Holyrood Park
It’s rare to find a hike of such natural beauty in any city. But Edinburgh 
is no ordinary metropolis. You can walk to the top of Arthur’s Seat or
cheat and drive to the park — either way, you find plenty to soak in,
especially the views. Chapter 11 contains more information on this
Edinburgh landmark.
At the foot of the Royal Mile, Edinburgh.

Cuillin Hills
These dark, brooding hills make a stunning backdrop on the Isle of Skye.
However, you might want to also get out and hike around in a bit of the
region, too. Some of the trails are easy, but don’t attempt to climb the
peaks unless you’re an experienced hiker. You can find details on this
area in Chapter 19.
Isle of Skye, the Hebrides.
Fingal’s Cave
Near Mull, the rock formations and cathedral-like columns of Fingal’s
Cave on the Isle of Staffa were enough to inspire Mendelssohn’s
Hebridean Overture. In addition to the geological beauty, the puffin
colony here is a bonus. Go to Chapter 19 for details on boat tours of
Fingal’s Cave.
Staffa, the Hebrides.
Glen Coe
This lovely Highland valley runs some 16km (10 miles) and is fairly
breathtaking every bit of the way — even though it’s best known as the
site of a 17th-century massacre. You can climb Ossian’s Ladder, a trail up
the hillside, or other equally strenuous paths on your own — or opt for a
more moderate ranger-led hike. See Chapter 18 for additional informa-
tion on the valley.
Between King’s House and Ballchulish, the Highlands.
Inverewe Garden
I’m cheating a bit with this recommendation, because Scotland’s many
marvelous gardens aren’t exactly natural attractions so much as man-
made wonders. But no matter how it came to be, Inverewe Garden is 
one of the loveliest gardens in the country, showing off some glories of
nature: towering trees, flowering shrubs, and almost tropical species
that survive thanks to the warming North Atlantic flow from the Gulf of
Mexico. For a more complete description of this garden and for visitor
information, check out Chapter 18.
Near Poolewe, Wester Ross, Western Highlands.
Chapter 24: Ten Stunning Natural Attractions 413

Loch Lomond
I list it largely because it is so accessible. Only a 45-minute drive north
from Glasgow puts you at this excellent body of fresh water. The pretty
scenery is best seen by a boat tour, but plenty of spots along its shores
make for good picnic stops, as well. Coming here allows you to get a
taste of the Highlands without straying too far from the big city. Flip to
Chapter 16 for details.
Northwest of Glasgow, West Dumbartonshire.
Loch Ness
Monster hunting aside, this huge loch in the middle of Scotland is a
lovely natural wonder. Deep, dark, and brooding, it’s little wonder that
people believe Loch Ness hides a legendary beast. The best way to see it
is by boat. Find out more about them in Chapter 18.
Between Fort George and Inverness, Central Highlands.
Sands of Morar
Between Arisaig and Mallaig on Scotland’s beautiful West Coast, the
beaches of Morar are so spectacular that they’ve been used in several
movies, most notably Bill Forsyth’s Local Hero. The light is magical in the
evenings, especially during summer when the sun slowly sets in the north-
western skies. Find out more about the Sands of Morar in Chapter 18.
Road to the Isles, Western Highlands.
Sandwood Bay
Within the nature conservation area of the Sandwood Estate, this beach
is the most pristine on the Scottish mainland. In part that’s because
you’ll need to walk for about 90 minutes from the nearest road to reach
it. See Chapter 18 for more details.

American Express
The AmEx offices in Edinburgh and
Glasgow exchange money and traveler’s
checks as well as perform other services
for cardholders. The Edinburgh office is 
at 69 George St., at Frederick Street 
(% 0131-718-2501; Bus: 13, 19, or 41). It’s
open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.;
on Wednesday, the office opens at 9:30 a.m.
The Glasgow office is located at 115 Hope

Enoch) and is open Monday through Friday
from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (except Wed
when it opens at 9:30 a.m.), and Saturday
from 9 a.m. to noon.
ATMs
In Scotland, ATMs (automated teller
machines) are called cash points or cash
machines. In the cities as well as in many
of the larger towns, ATMs now often con-
nect to international systems such as
Cirrus or PLUS. Many will give cash
advances on major credit cards as well.
Business Hours
Most businesses are open Monday
through Saturday from 9 or 9:30 a.m. to 5 or
5:30 p.m., with some exceptions. Many
businesses and shops are closed Sunday,
although many shops in the cities open on
Sunday afternoons. Most cities also have
extended shopping hours on Thursday until
8 p.m. Outside of Edinburgh and Glasgow,
businesses may close for lunch, generally
from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m.
Banks are normally open from 9 a.m. or 
10 a.m. until about 5 p.m. on weekdays.
Banks are good places to exchange cur-
rency and get credit card cash advances.
Restaurants and pubs have different
restrictions on hours of operation depend-
ing upon their licensing, which is con-
trolled by local councils. Although some
bars may not open until late afternoon,
most serve drinks from noon to midnight
and maybe later on weekends. Some pubs
in residential and rural areas, however,
close at 11 p.m. Many restaurants stop
serving food at 2:30 p.m. and resume at
5:30 or 6 p.m. Nightclubs in cities and
larger towns have late-night hours, staying
open until between 1 and 3 a.m. — but
doors may not open until 10 p.m.
Cameras and Film
Most pharmacies sell photo supplies and
many have photo-developing services as
well. One-hour film processing is available
in larger cities. These services and prod-
ucts are more expensive abroad than in
the U.S. If you have to buy photo supplies
or film while you’re in Scotland, go to a
camera shop or department store. Never
buy film from a souvenir stand near a
tourist attraction, where the markup is
high.

% 702-797-5532 (members can call collect).
Currency Exchange
You can change money at any place with
the sign BUREAU DE CHANGE. You find these
signs at banks, which give you the best
rates; major post office branches; and
many hotels and travel agencies. (See
Chapter 5 for more information on dealing
with money in Scotland.)
Customs
U.K. Customs restricts the value of goods
you can bring into Scotland to about £150
($277). U.S. citizens returning to Scotland
after an absence of at least 48 hours are
allowed to bring back, once every 30 days,
$800 worth of merchandise duty-free.
Driving
In Scotland, cars travel on the left side of
the road. (See Chapter 7 for more details
on driving in Scotland.)
Drugstores
Drugstores are called pharmacies or
chemists in Scotland. The regulations for
over-the-counter and prescription drugs
differ from those in the U.S., so you may
not find commercial pharmaceuticals or
your preferred medicine. Consider bringing
your own products from the U.S.
Electricity
The electric current in Scotland is 240 volts
AC, which is different than the U.S. cur-
rent, so most small appliances brought
from the U.S., such as hair dryers and
shavers, don’t work (and the current could
damage the appliance). If you’re consider-
ing bringing your laptop or iron from home,
check the voltage first to see if it has a
range between 110v and 240v. If the volt-
age doesn’t have a range, the only option
is to purchase an expensive converter. If
the voltage does have a higher range, then
you still need to buy an outlet adapter
because your prongs won’t fit in the
Scottish sockets. You can buy an adapter
for about $10 at an appliance store or even
at the airport.
Embassies and Consulates
Embassies are located in the capital of
Great Britain, London. Edinburgh has 
consulates for Australia (69 George St.; 
% 0131-624-3700), Canada (30 Lothian Rd.;
% 0131-245-6013), and the United States
(3 Regents Terrace; % 0131-556-8315).
Emergencies
For any emergency, contact the police or
an ambulance by calling % 999 from any
phone. You can also call the National
Health Service Helpline, % 0800-22-4488,
which offers health-related advice and
assistance from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.
(See Chapter 9 for details on accessing
health care in Scotland.) Every city and
regional chapter lists local hospitals. For
emergencies, treatment is free, although
you will be billed for long stays.
Internet Access
Many hotels offer Internet access (though
it’s usually rather expensive), and Internet
cafes are popular, especially near central
railway stations. See the major city and
regional chapters for more information.
Language
English is the principal language spoken in
Scotland, although heavy accents and
local vernacular (especially words used by
lowland Scots) can make it difficult to
comprehend. Ask the natives to speak
more slowly if you can’t understand them.
Scotland For Dummies, 4th Edition 
416

Gaelic is spoken in the Highlands and
islands, where signs are frequently in both
Gaelic and English.
Liquor Laws
The minimum drinking age in Scotland is
18. Liquor stores, called off-licenses (or
off-sales) sell spirits, beer, and wine and
generally operate from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Maps
Decent street maps and city plans are sold
at most tourist information centers and
major newsstands. For detailed ordinance
survey maps, try the major booksellers
such as Waterstone’s or Borders.
Police
For emergencies, dial % 999.
Post Office
Most branches of the post office are open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon. Smaller,
rural branches may be open weekdays
from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2:15 to 5:30 p.m.
as well as Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Many post offices close early on one day
of the week, but how early and what day
depends on the office.
Sending a postcard from Scotland to North
America or Australia and New Zealand
costs 47p (90¢). Letters (under 20 grams)
cost 68p ($1.35). Mail usually takes one
week (sometimes less) to get to the United
States. For information on mail services in
Scotland and the U.K., call % 08457-740-
740 or visit www.royalmail.com. See
the major city and regional chapters for
more post office information.
Safety
Violent crime rates are low in Scotland.
There are few guns in the country, and
most police officers don’t carry them,
either. As a tourist, the most important
thing you can do is guard yourself against
theft. Pickpockets look for people who
seem to have the most money on them and
who appear to know the least about where
they are. Be extra careful on crowded
trains in the big cities and when taking
money from ATMs.
Smoking
In April 2006, a ban on smoking in all
enclosed public spaces — including busi-
ness offices, restaurants, and pubs —
went into effect. Smoking was already 
prohibited on all trains and buses.
Taxes
A consumption tax of 17.5 percent is put 
on pretty much all goods and services. It’s
called VAT (value-added tax), and it works
like local sales taxes do in the United
States. But tourists are entitled to a partial
refund (see Chapter 5 for more informa-
tion). VAT is nonrefundable for services
such as hotels, meals, and car rentals.
Telephones
The country code for Scotland is 44. To
make international calls from Scotland,
dial 00 and then the country code, local
code, and telephone number. The U.S. and
Canadian country code is 1, Australia is 61,
and New Zealand is 63. If you can’t find a
number, a directory is available by dialing
a variety of numbers (thanks to privatiza-
tion of the service), including % 118-811
or % 118-800 for domestic numbers and
% 118-505 for international numbers.
Scotland has pay phones that accept coins
and credit cards, although the use of cell-
phones (called mobiles) means you see
fewer pay phones. If you’re interested in
renting a cellphone to use during your visit,
check out Chapter 10 for more information.
Appendix: Quick Concierge 417

Time Zone
Scotland follows Greenwich Mean Time,
which is five time zones ahead of eastern
standard time in the United States (eight
hours ahead of the Pacific Coast). So,
when it’s noon in New York, it’s 5 p.m. in
Glasgow. The clocks are set forward by
one hour for British summer time in late
March, which expires at the end of
October. The high latitude blesses the
country with long days in the summer, with
sunset as late as 10 or even 11 p.m. But the
opposite is true in winter, when the sun
sets as early as 3:30 or 4 p.m.
Weather Updates
For weather forecasts of the day and 24
hours in advance, and for severe road-
condition warnings, call the Met Office at
% 0870-900-0100. An advisor offers fore-
casts for the entire region and beyond at
your request.

Where to Get More Information
If you’re looking for more information on Scotland, start with the
Scottish Tourist Board or, as it prefers to be called these days,
VisitScotland.com (% 0845–225-5121; www.visitscotland.com). The
Web site has information on accommodations, attractions, and general
topics, and you can get details on special offers and promotions. You
can also find recommended attractions as well as listings for hotels,
guesthouses, B&Bs, self-catering lodging, caravan and camping sites,
serviced apartments, and hostels. Keep in mind that hotels, restaurants,
and attractions generally pay to be included in these listings, however,
so they haven’t necessarily been evaluated on any level.
Plenty of Web sites offer helpful and interesting information on Scotland;
listed below are a few of the better ones. (Remember, though, that things
can change quickly in cyberspace, so a site may have been transformed
by the time you read this.)
 www.geo.ed.ac.uk/scotgaz/scotland.html: A one-stop shop
for info on Scotland’s shopping, recreation, attractions, weather,
tours, and more. This site also has good interactive maps.
 www.travelscotland.co.uk: A great site for news, sports, his-
tory, attraction information, and Scotland travel chats. This site
even has a clan-finder tool to help you locate the regions of your
Scottish ancestors.
 www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/scotland.html: A great
place to get Scottish history, maps, and demographics. You can
also search the encyclopedic reference guide on this Web site.
Warning: Turn the sound off (or at least turn the volume down) 
on your computer before opening this site — a headache-inducing
soundtrack of Scottish Muzak plays nonstop while the site is open.
 www.frommers.com/destinations/scotland: Offers complete
and up-to-date information on Scotland as well as message boards
and more.
