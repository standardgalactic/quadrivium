How to Approach Any Group & Get Them 
Excited About Street Hypnosis 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Igor: 
You don’t seem too excited? How are you guys doing?  I can leave 
again if you want.  It’s great to see so many old faces again.  So 
who’s been with me before?  Hands up.  And who just knows about 
me?  Who doesn’t know what the hell they are here for, the 
knitting needle convention but they have gone the wrong way.  
These are going to be great knitting needles.  I’m sitting here with a 
great hypnotist, a true master of his art, Anthony Jacquin.  Some of 
you may have heard of him before.  Some of you may have been 
familiar with the interview with we did with him on the club.  
Anyone come across his work before?  You guys are in for a real 
treat.   
 
When it comes to doing street hypnosis, honestly, I haven’t seen 
anyone do as much and as varied and interesting stuff as Anthony 
does.  One of the reasons it’s taken us a while to put this seminar, 
which we’ve wanted for a while, is because most people are doing 
street hypnosis in a very boring fashion.  They stick hands to tables 
and you can’t say your name.  Those are fine things to do, right?  
They’re absolutely appropriate and fantastic and entertaining and 
so on but it doesn’t go anywhere.  Does that make sense?   
 
As a starting point, fantastic, but where do you evolve from that?  
And this is where Anthony’s a true genius, has really come up with 
some amazing things and we’ll be sharing those things with you 
today.  Really over the next three days what we’ll be doing is 
teaching you street hypnosis as hopefully you realize, that’s what 
you’re here. And really, how to go beyond street hypnosis, in other 
words, there are some areas you can take it into so you become 
true performers or a genuine force for good, depending on which 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
7 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
side of the fence that you’re most interested in.  Does that make 
sense?  So why don’t you give Anthony a nice round of applause to 
welcome him.  Do you want to say a few words? 
 
Anthony: 
Yes, I will do.  I’ve been running a few street hypnosis courses on 
my own over the last few years and I’m very excited about this one, 
a nice big group and if you don’t know what the schedule is, it’s 
very much about practical training.  So lots of practical in here and 
I’m going to get out in the street amongst some real people and 
you’re going to do this and I wholeheartedly expect you all to have 
success.  It’s not difficult to do and it’s certainly more challenging to 
do well and to do in a manner that is going to give the person a 
good experience and leave you feeling good, but I know you’re 
going to have that experience at some point this weekend so make 
the most of it. 
 
Igor: 
So on that note, I may have noticed a few faces going, like, oh-ho-
ho, this is real now. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s real. 
 
Igor: 
Is anyone here a little bit concerned, a little nervous perhaps, 
downright terrified?  Yes?  And it’s normal, it’s natural, right?  
You’re about to engage in something which is live, it’s something 
that you’re not used to.  The irony is, once we get through the 
training you’ll see this.  The mechanics of street hypnosis are 
actually very straight-forward.  In terms of mechanics, you’ll have 
those down pat by today.  You’ll do street hypnosis like the best of 
the YouTube videos you might have seen, probably better, right?  
The mechanics are easy to do.  The performance elements are what 
we’ll be focusing on tomorrow and that’s where Anthony is a real 
genius.   
 
He’s really come up with some fantastic things here and we’ll really 
focus tomorrow on those performance elements and how to create 
something that people will truly remember for the rest of their 
lives, and then we can see if we can take it beyond then to the idea 
of covert street hypnosis, how did all this sort of start and be a 
genuine of good in people’s lives without them ever knowing, which 
is kind of nice.  But we’ll have to come back to this idea of fear.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

What’s going on here?  Why are we afraid of the idea of doing stuff 
out there?  Now, if we were to say, just go out and say hello to five 
people you don’t know.   
 
Would it be fair to say that most of you would still feel a little bit 
anxious about just that, right?  So perhaps it’s not so much that 
you’re afraid of doing hypnosis in public, well, that’s kind of a little 
bit unusual but it’s just a normal social phobia that we have as part 
of our society at the moment and if we can take care of that 
element, perhaps that social phobia, that fear you feel right now 
would disappear.  Wouldn’t that be reasonable to think?  Right? 
 
Anthony: 
I quite agree, absolutely.  I mean, I think the vast majority of men 
especially but maybe it’s the same for women, have been in a 
situation at college or in a networking meeting or just being bored 
in a pub where they’ve wanted to speak to somebody.  They don’t 
necessarily want to pull that person and take them home.  They just 
would rather be having a conversation and I know I’ve done that.  I 
lived in London for eight to nine years and could quite easily go out 
and not engage in a conversation in a busy bar, in a busy pub.  So 
it’s a skill that I’ve had to learn and I know it can be learned and the 
biggest part of it is just having a go and getting over this little 
adrenaline dump.   
 
You’re going to fell, eh, what am I going to say?  What if they just 
laugh?  If they walk away, you’re going to feel that but then we’re 
going to get through that and afterwards it will just be so much 
easier, and we’re doing hypnosis here, hypnosis as much as, I 
believe, you can all have the experience of hypnosis.  In terms of 
performing and getting in front of people you really want to get in 
front of, it is a numbers game.  So if you do what I did for a long 
period of time and look out there and think; he’s too analytical; 
she’s too stupid; he’s too boring; they’re too heavily engaged in a 
conversation, you’re never going to get anywhere.   
 
You need to be able to walk up to pretty much any group without 
ruining their private conversation.  You need to be able to walk up, 
introduce yourself, and essentially engage them with something 
that is hugely engaging for the vast majority of people.  You say the 
word, hypnosis, you’re going to have some ears prick up, and we 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
9 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
will come onto the covert stuff and how you can get into this 
without ever having to use that word but that doesn’t make it 
easier.  It’s infinitely easier if you can be open and welcoming and 
just meet people as equals in the world.  So it’s going to be useful, if 
for nothing else, to learn how to meet people, how to talk to 
people, how to have a better time. 
 
Igor: 
And you are going to have a great time.  So, in order to overcome 
this social phobia, there are mechanics and we’ll be going through 
how to meet someone new and engage them enough that they 
want to do hypnosis with you and we’ll be doing a lot of that today 
and it will be actually a no-brainer by the time we get out there and 
it’s actually doing this in public.   
 
But I’d like to give you a little insight in terms of what’s going on 
there.  Why is it that we’re afraid of talking to a stranger?  Really, if 
you think about it, we’re not afraid of talking to them.  We’re afraid 
of what might happen if we did, in other words, they might reject 
us, rebuff us.  I don’t think anyone here is particularly concerned it 
might get violent and crazy because we know not to talk to those 
people anyway.  They’re kind of relatively obvious, like, the guy 
talked to himself, spitting at everyone and so on.  Hey, how’s it 
going?  Have you seen hypnosis?  Bah, right?  I’m guessing you have 
enough social intelligence to not be going after those sorts of 
people. So really the only fear that we have to deal with sometimes 
is their rejection, right?  Now, why do we feel afraid of that?   
 
Let’s think in terms of, like, survival of psychology or evolution of 
psychology, is the popular term nowadays.  We belong to a tribe.  
We love being part of a herd.  That’s part of human instincts.  We’re 
part of the ape kingdom, whether we like it or not, and they like to 
run around in troops and tribes.  What happens to the little monkey 
that gets kicked out of the tribe?  What are its survival chances?  
Not high.  They have to work a lot harder to do their own thing.  So 
what happens is, somewhere intuitively we have this idea that if we 
get rejected by others, we’ll risk losing status within our social tribe, 
if you like, which means we might get kicked out of society and 
then life gets really tough.  Does that kind of make sense?

Now, ironically, of course, that’s not the kind of world we live 
anymore because it’s kind of anonymous anyway, we’re not part of 
it, we’re just navigating through it.  We have our circle of friends 
and if ten complete strangers on the street are absolutely rude to 
you, does that have any impact at all on your social circle, your 
circle of friends and so on?  No.  Yet knowing that doesn’t really 
help, does it, because you’re still thinking, like, all right, now go 
outside and talk to ten strangers and you’ll go, ahh, no.  
 
So we need to do something else and this is one of the rules I’m 
going to ask you guys to adhere to whilst you’re in here. If you 
continue to follow them once you leave here, that’s entirely up to 
you but whilst you’re a part of this training, there’s going to be one 
fundamental rule I’m going to ask you to follow which will help this 
whole dynamic, is this:  Right now, if you just look around the room 
a moment, you’ll see that there’s other people in this room, right?  I 
hope you haven’t hallucinated them away.  If someone doesn’t see 
anyone else in this room, please come to me.  You’ll be my first 
subject.  So this is your tribe for the next three days.  This is your 
social circuit.  This is, you’re going to be, support network.  Now, 
this is important.   
 
When you’re talking to other people, when you’re going out on the 
street to do street hypnosis and so on, you’re not looking for 
support from the people that you’re talking to.  The support you’re 
looking for is the group that you’re with.  Does that make sense?  
Now, if you’re in that group, you need to actually offer that 
support.  Otherwise, when it’s your turn, you’ll suffer just as badly 
as what everyone else is doing.  Now, here’s the key:  The key isn’t, 
what do you do to make it go right?  That’s easy and we’ll show you 
how to do that.  The key is how do you handle things when they 
don’t go right.   
 
In other words, when someone rejects you, walks away and so on, 
and it’s going to happen; I guarantee you that.  It’s going to happen.  
So what do you do?  How do you handle that moment?  If you get 
that one right, it’s actually a piece of cake.  You know the secret?  
The secret will come on in terms of what you do.  The secret in 
terms of what your tribe does is very simple.

Let me give you two scenarios.  Let’s say Anthony, he’s a master 
hypnotist, has gone up and talked to a group of girls out on a night 
out and says, do you want to do some hypnosis and they go, get 
away from me, you freak, right?  Now, there’s a couple of 
responses I might give to him as a part of his social group.  I might 
go, nah ha ha, how foolish do you feel?  Useful or not useful? 
 
Audience Member: Not useful. 
 
Igor: 
Is that the kind of tribe you want to belong to?   
 
Audience Member: No. 
 
Igor: 
So don’t do it, right?  What about if we say to him, oh, don’t worry, 
you’re okay; it’s okay; don’t cry now; put that little tear back in your 
eye, try again tomorrow.  How’s he going to feel?  Is he going to feel 
empowered right now?  Because, think about it, indirectly – now, 
the intention is fine; I see no problem with the intention but what 
happens in the actual scenario?  Indirectly you’re saying to him, oh, 
your status has just plummeted to the ground and the only place 
you can get any kind of self-esteem back is from me, oh, yeah. 
Right?  Now, again, is that useful or not?  Is that the kind of tribe 
you want to be part of?  Not unless you like pity fests, right?   
 
What about if he does his thing, gets rebuffed, comes back with a 
big smile and goes, dude, that was awesome.  Did you see – I have 
to say, I really admire the way you handled that because you 
walked back with your head held high.  Good on you.  Is that better 
or worse than the previous two things you’ve seen?  Would you like 
to be treated that way if something kind of goes a little awry in the 
streets?  Right?  Maybe not. 
 
Audience Member: Probably not.  It’s not true, right? 
 
Igor: 
Oh, it will be true. 
 
Anthony: 
Because if you’ve gone in there and you’ve delivered your 
technique appropriately and done the job, then you can still have 
feedback, you can still say, I think you over-crowded her; I think you 
came in too quickly.  You can still have feedback but you can still 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
12 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
have support.  I understand what you’re saying but we’re not saying 
it was ten out of ten perfect; we’re simply saying, look, next, let’s 
move onto the next group.  Well done, you approached people; 
well done for getting out the blocks; well done for sticking to the – 
 
Igor: 
Because there’s some things you’ll have done right, and also, 
remember, we’ll be showing you elegant ways of getting out of, 
what if they don’t want to play with you, right?  We’ll show you 
some elegant responses to that so you don’t have to walk off with 
your tail between your legs going, oh, that was terrible, so you can 
walk off and go, fair enough.  So we will give you those pieces.  The 
key thing is, as long as you’re engaging and performing, you’ll be 
doing some things right.  If nothing else, it’s having the guts to walk 
up to someone and do it.  Does that make sense?  And that’s worth 
putting energy into.   
 
Who has heard me say this before, the general principle:  Where 
attention goes, energy flows?  Anyone?  Right?  Do you believe it?  
Right?  Where do you want your attention to go:  Oh, you miserable 
failure; they laughed at you, oh, or, you did something right; you’ve 
gone the next step closer to being a genuine street hypnotist.  It 
really doesn’t matter how they respond because there’s hundreds 
of people out there.  What matters is how you respond as a result 
of whatever happened.  Because one thing I can absolutely 
guarantee you, Alex and everyone else, I will guarantee this one 
hundred percent right now:  You’re going to approach people at 
some point and they’re not going to be interested; guaranteed, 
right?  Just accept that because it’s going to happen.  It’s going to 
happen to me, it’s going to happen to Anthony, it’s going to happen 
to every single one of you guys.   
 
The key isn’t whether or not that will happen.  It’s, can you 
minimize it happening, in other words, can you improve your 
approach so that more people are going to be interested, the ones 
that are going to be interested aren’t going to be scared off?  And, 
do you have a way of handling things so that you can leave with 
your self-esteem intact if it hadn’t quite worked out.  You solve 
those two things; you’re in good shape, aren’t you?

So when you think of it like that, already now, and I know you 
haven’t got the pieces in place, just as ideas, how much easier or 
how much more at ease do you feel thinking about going on the 
streets?   
 
So, those nodding heads tell me that really we’ve gone to the issue 
of it.  It’s just a question of, can we have ways of approaching, can 
we have ways of exiting elegantly, whether it’s in a, quote unquote 
successful interaction in terms of hypnosis or just a successful 
interaction in terms of, you talked to someone, they’re not 
interested and that’s fine.  But once you have all those things in 
place, where does the fear go?  The answer is away.   
 
Now, that’s something worth investing your energy into, isn’t it?  So 
the only rule I’m going to ask you guys to do in here, because you 
may as well practice in here what you’ll be doing out there, is to 
find something that you can encourage the other person about.  
We’ll talk about how to add actual feedback in terms of how to 
improve something, all the rest of it, later.  For the moment, it’s 
absolutely critical, here more so than ever, the only feedback you 
give in this, especially initially, is on something they’ve actually 
genuinely done well, something you can admire about what they’ve 
done.  Does that make sense?  You’ll all do that.  We’ll be testing 
you. 
 
Audience Member: Having a go is admirable. 
 
Anthony: 
Stepping up, having a go, putting yourself in a position where 
you’re going to feel some adrenaline, it’s just a feeling.   
 
Igor: 
You guys just turned up.  That, in itself – you knew what you signed 
up for, right?  You do realize we’re going on the street for this stuff?  
So the very fact you just signed up for this, that in itself is worth 
respecting, isn’t it?  Look around the room.  How do you feel about 
the other people in this room who, despite the fact they probably 
felt just as afraid as you did in walking in here, nevertheless, signed 
up, they bothered to turn up, they’re sitting in this chair, and even 
though some little part of them is going, oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit, 
they’re going, I’m still going to do this.

I mean, how much more respect do you have for your fellow 
students in this room knowing that that’s the case?  That’s an 
admirable person, isn’t it?  Well, guess what?  Every single person in 
the room is thinking about you in exactly the same way.   
 
So I want you to just store that in the back of your mind a little bit 
because that’s going to be an important part of the attitude we’ll be 
bringing onto street hypnosis, okay?  In order to help you do this, 
we’re going to have a lot of exercises to prepare you.  So I happen 
to believe in drilling, I know Anthony believes in the idea of drilling, 
those of you who have trained with me before know I believe in 
drilling.   
 
Anyone here, you guys who went to the stage hypnosis course, of 
course.  There will be similar things going on because we want to 
hardwire into you a simple street routine that even if your mind 
goes blank, your mouth still talks and your body still moves and 
then you’ll come back going, I have no idea what I did but it kind of 
worked, which means it’s all about you getting to that mindset of, 
I’m going to be performing and doing stuff in here, out there, it’s 
really no difference.   
 
By that point, really, you’ll be having such a blast you won’t be able 
to help yourself anymore.  If you’re not coming, screw you, buddy, 
I’m going on my own, right?  I can virtually guarantee that.  I can’t 
do it for everyone here but I can guarantee for most people.   
 
I’ll give you an example of what I mean.  Some years ago, it’s 
probably now – a long time ago, when I was much younger, had the 
same hair though, I was at university and I was just starting up at a 
martial arts club at the university so there’s something called 
Pressure Squash.  I think different universities call it different 
things.  It’s basically where all the new first year undergrads, the 
Freshers, and again, pumped into this big hall and all the different 
societies and the Cheese and Wine Society, the Let’s Make Up Silly 
Words Society and all the kind of stuff students do, right, they get 
to sign up new members and then they do their activities and what 
not, right?  It’s called Pressure Squash because everyone gets 
squashed into a big room and hope for the best.

So all these people running around and my job is to get them signed 
up through my school because otherwise it’s going to be empty, 
right, and I want to have fun.  So I’m sitting there and I’ve got a 
couple of friends who helped me out because I’d been teaching 
them informally; oh, well, they may as well make it to the formal 
club, and no one’s stopping, I’m going, oh, I get it, I’ve got to do 
something, so then of course little nerves come up going, what do I 
do, what do I do?   
 
So then eventually I just bit the bullet because all these people 
were rushing by, and my first fresher was probably terrible, rushed 
around going, mumble, mumble, mumble. “What?”  No, I’m all 
right.   
 
I’m going, hmm, maybe I need to slow down a little bit. And the 
approach was very simple, just do a little self defense and most 
people would pass, some would go, oh, really. Then I’d engage in a 
conversation and then I might show them some things, have the 
video running so we might show them some of those things too, 
what I was talking about it, and then I think by the end of the day 
we had, like, fifty people signed up which is pretty damned good, 
right?   
 
So the irony was, though, going in, I felt like, that sense of, like, it’s 
almost like a bubble of emotion building up inside.  I didn’t want to 
get through it.  It’s like, ah, I don’t know, I don’t want to talk to 
them, I don’t know about this.  And I bit the bullet and at first it was 
a little bit awkward but then something really weird happened, 
something that you can expect to happen.  At some point, it was 
the second, maybe the third person I talked and I had a really good 
interaction.  The bubble inside burst but all that energy was still 
there and suddenly it felt like I was on fire.  I couldn’t stop. Even by 
the end of the evening when basically, like, three people, like a 
lame man in a wheelchair and a dog with no eyeballs was walking 
through, I jumped into them going, “Do you like self defense?” “Like 
me?  Come on.”   
 
But I got so excited, was so enthusiastic about the whole thing that 
when it was over, I was sorry and I was thinking, like, how can I do 
this again?  Oh, my God, maybe organize events where people 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
16 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
come in and – because I liked it.  It was enjoyable.  It’s pretty 
interesting, isn’t it, to the extent that you have that emotion arising 
right now, that’s the extent to which you will end up enjoying street 
hypnosis at the end, because the energy is the same. It’s just the 
direction where it goes will be slightly different.  Does that make 
sense to you guys?  Is that something that happened to you as well? 
 
Anthony:  
Yeah, I’ve had many moments like that so. For those who don’t 
know my background, I was taught hypnotherapy by my father 
when I was twenty-one, spent six years in other jobs and wound up 
being a hypnotherapist and eventually I was made redundant, 
punched the air and I’ve been a hypnotherapist ever since. But 
along the way, the approach I had at that point was entirely based 
on what you some of you will know as indirect Ericksonian some 
conversational type hypnosis so I kind of had that whole language 
piece down.  For the first three-and-a-half thousand people I’ve 
hypnotized, I did not say the word, sleep.  It wouldn’t have occurred 
to me to say the word, sleep.  It was irrelevant.  Surely that’s 
incongruent with their experience, and then one day, I decided – I 
was just in someone’s house, they said, can you show me 
something.  I said yes. I’d never done it before, I used this overload 
induction, some of you may know if you read Transformations 
where I spin the guy around and ask him to do some sums in his 
head and then just said, anytime it’s easier to sit in a chair and go 
into a trance – pfooh – I bellowed the word, sleep and he was out. 
 
 And I felt this rush coming up through the soles of my feet, literally 
just like, he’s gone. I didn’t know what to say and I woke him up 
within about ten seconds.   
 
And then I was out in a pub a few months after that and the same 
sort of question came up and I used the rehearsal induction which 
is still really advocated that people learn. It’s never really failed me. 
It was the same thing, before I knew it; someone was having a 
major experience.  I won’t go into the details but I had the same 
feeling, the same rush of excitement kind of mixed with, I’d say fear 
of what had just been unleashed but it was partly responsibility.  I 
realized that this is very real and this is not just someone sitting 
comfortably in a chair analyzing what I’m saying.  So it’s the same 
cycle.

It’s the same adrenaline cycle as Igor was pointing out. It is just 
where you point it and what you call it.  I’m the same.  If we go out, 
we walk out in the street later on and we’re going to start walking 
up to groups of strangers and you going to pull someone to me and 
I’ve done this thousands of times, you’re still going to detect a rise 
in the beat of my heart. I guarantee that. I’m going to walk up to 
people, it will get to a certain point, but as soon as you’re over that 
intro, you’re just having a conversation and fortunately for you, you 
happen to have the most interesting hook in the world which is 
hypnosis.  So you’ll find it gets easier and easier but it doesn’t really 
get less exciting for me.  I wouldn’t do it otherwise. 
 
 
Training Induction 
 
Igor: 
And remember that you are doing this – right now you’re focusing 
on your own self, like, can I do this?  Is this enough?  What am I 
supposed to do?  I don’t know what to say.  But very soon, and by 
the end of, actually, by the beginning of the lunch break you should 
be at this point, your point of view will begin to shift.  It will, 
because your focus should not be you.  You focus should be on 
them.  You’re about to open a part of someone that is immensely 
powerful.  It’s very deep.  And you’re going to help them create the 
connection.  That’s something you need to respect.  To the extent 
you respect that your hypnosis becomes easier and stronger.   
 
Anthony:  
Every single passing moment will get easier.  Let’s try something.  
Would you all just place your feet flat on the floor.  If you can, just 
put your drinks down and place you hands in your lap and relax.  
We’re going to take some time out so what I’d like you to do, when 
you’re ready, is take a nice, slow, deep breath in –  
 
Igor:  
- and focus inside - 
 
Anthony:  
- and close your eyes - 
 
Igor: 
- finding something –

Anthony: 
 -and as quickly as you’re ready –  
 
Igor: 
- that’s important to you –  
 
Anthony: 
- to face what it is you need to face –  
 
Igor: 
- discovering resources inside.   
 
Anthony: 
 
So just for a time –  
 
Igor:  
 
- that I’ve been there all along –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- use this opportunity –  
 
Igor:  
 
- only you didn’t know it –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- to let go of the day, let go of the journey here –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and where would you find those resources –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- because you have nothing to do –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and you have no idea where they’ll be –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- there is nobody wanting anything –  
 
Igor:  
 
- inside –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- there’s somebody expecting anything –  
 
Igor:  
 
- they exist, waiting –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- so as you make yourself comfortable –  
 
Igor:  
 
- to be discovered –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- I want you to –  
 
Igor:  
 
- by you –

Anthony: 
 
- listen to that inner voice of yours –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and find yourself –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- because there’s a –  
 
Igor:  
 
- drifting –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- well known phrase –  
 
Igor:  
 
- deeper and deeper –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- that pain leads to the source –  
 
Igor:  
 
- let it guide you –  
 
Anthony:  
 
So just for a time I want you to imagine you’re –  
 
Igor:  
 
- all the way –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- in that situation –  
 
Igor:  
 
- all the way –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- where you want to speak to somebody –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and find something more than you were –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and I want you to find that feeling in your own body –  
 
Igor:  
 
- something you thought was not you –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and recognize it as just a feeling –  
 
Igor:  
 
- but is more you –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- a signal –  
 
Igor:  
 
- than you ever realized –

Anthony: 
 
- and this is a signal you can point, you can direct –  
 
Igor:  
 
- inside, it’s beginning to happen –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- step outside yourself now –  
 
Igor:  
 
- perhaps noticing a point of comfort over there –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- understanding, and I know that you do –  
 
Igor:  
 
- more than you are –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- you have a conscious mind –  
 
Igor:  
 
- is what you’re capable of –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and you have an unconscious mind –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and you can take all that –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and it’s working for you –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and find yourself –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- wants you to be well –  
 
Igor:  
 
- just feeling good –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and I want you to be happy –  
 
Igor:  
 
- healthy –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- what you’re learning –  
 
Igor:  
 
- vibrant and strong –  
 
Anthony:   
 
- to do is give it direction –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and take all these experiences –

Anthony: 
 
- so just for a time go out into a fantasy –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and find the right channel –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- get a sense of yourself achieving what you want to achieve  
 
Igor:  
 
- to focus it through –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- things you want to achieve from this course –  
 
Igor:  
 
- all it takes –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and the course –  
 
Igor:  
 
- is a simple idea –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- you can take away with you –  
 
Igor:  
 
- people connect, happens all the time; you have a friend –  
 
Anthony: 
 
 - and you can pretend –  
 
Igor:  
 
- inside and out –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- And you can master things –  
 
Igor: 
- there’s no problem talking to your friends, no need to plan a 
conversation –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- you’re going to find a time where –  
 
Igor:  
 
- you just know –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- you achieved something  –  
 
Igor:  
 
- you feel good in their company –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- something that you know might be a challenge –  
 
Igor:  
 
- find someone you love now –

Anthony: 
 
- something you took on where you know there’d be –  
 
Igor:  
 
- a friend –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- some bumps along the way –  
 
Igor:  
 
- a pet, a parent, a lover –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- some changes in direction –  
 
Igor:  
 
- a child, acquaintance –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- that at some level –  
 
Igor:  
 
- someone you know and you really love –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- you absolutely know –  
 
Igor: 
- if you watched this person coming down the street, you couldn’t 
help but smile –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- You have the resources you need –  
 
Igor:  
 
- wave, I know you –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- whether it’s a color in your mind’s eye –  
 
Igor:  
 
- feel that now –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- thoughts and images going through it –  
 
Igor:  
 
- remember it –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and wonder –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and know it –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- you are going –

Igor:  
 
- because every person you meet today –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- do this successfully –  
 
Igor:  
 
- will have a spark of this –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- to look forward to that moment tomorrow –  
 
Igor:  
 
- your job is not to get them to like you –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and you’re looking back to now –  
 
Igor:  
 
- it’s so much easier –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- realizing you just did it –  
 
Igor:  
 
- your job is to like them –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- your words flow –  
 
Igor:   
 
- find that spark inside of them –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- your actions flow –  
 
Igor:  
 
- that remind you of this person –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- as they do when you’re doing something you enjoy –  
 
Igor:  
 
- And makes you feel good –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and we’ve all had experiences –  
 
Igor:  
 
- so good –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- learning something new –  
 
Igor:  
 
- so natural –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- taking on fresh ideas –

Igor: 
- look at that stranger over there and find that spark of familiarity; 
maybe it’s the way they walk –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- you can be yourself –  
 
Igor: 
- a glint in their eye, something that reminds you of someone you 
love –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- you can be your best self –  
 
Igor:  
 
- see it inside them, feel it inside you –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and you’re the equal of anybody –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and notice it’s so easy to connect –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and you can look into their eyes –  
 
Igor:  
 
- with another human being –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and you can know absolutely –  
 
Igor:  
 
- Ahhhhhh –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- that they also have those creative resources –  
 
Igor:  
 
- that’s right, it’s natural to connect –  
 
Anthony:  
 
- A line of communication –  
 
Igor:  
 
- natural to be you –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- into that creative mind of theirs –  
 
Igor:  
 
- no one can be you like you can –  
 
Anthony: 
 
- and direct their attention –  
 
Igor:  
 
- and you can connect in a unique way to everyone –

Anthony: 
 
- and watch their energy flow –  
 
Igor: 
- feel it, enjoy it and notice it is easy when it comes from here, it’s 
natural, as natural as speaking to a friend, isn’t it, Anthony? 
 
Anthony: 
Absolutely, our conversation. 
 
Igor: 
I think so.  I think you could just walk up to a friend and shake their 
hand and say, hey, how’s it going? 
 
Anthony: 
Exactly. 
 
Igor: 
You don’t have to think about it. 
 
Anthony: 
Open your eyes and look them in the eyes. 
 
Igor: 
That’s normal, right? And shake their hands going, where’s your 
hand?  Hello?  Unless you’re Mr. Magoo, I guess.  I always loved 
that show. 
 
Anthony: 
Indeed. 
 
 
Approach Comfort 
 
Igor: 
So before we begin with any hypnosis, it’s probably useful that you 
guys get to meet your tribe because these are the people who are 
going to support you over the next few days, right?  We’re going to 
be there to give you the technical stuff.  We’re going to give you 
feedback and so on, but really, the place you will look for support is 
to your tribe because you can create a new tribe wherever you go.  
You can have a friend where it’s just two of you, or five of you, or 
fifty of you, it doesn’t matter.  We may as well connect and start 
building those relationships and so on.  Does that make sense?   
 
Now, what typically happens when you meet someone new? 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
26 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Normally there’s a hand shake involved, isn’t there?  Hello.  Or 
there’s an opportunity, isn’t there?  You can make eye contact.  
These are things that happen naturally.  You don’t have to re-think 
about them, do you?   
 
Do you give your name, just like, “Hi, my name is Igor.”  I hope you 
don’t call yourself Igor because we might have an identity crisis 
there, and sometimes if you don’t know the person, you normally 
tell them what you do, don’t you?  Well, in here, you’re a street 
hypnotist, aren’t you, so you may as well introduce yourself that 
way, and honestly, I don’t care what label you like to apply to what 
skills you’re learning here.   
 
You could say, “Hi, I’m Igor. I’m a street hypnotist.” You could say, 
I’m a hypnotist, a hypnosis master, a hypnotic entertainer, I’m a 
hypnotic performer.  I don’t really care what the label is but you all 
have an idea of a label that appeals to you, do you not?  And here’s 
the thing, when other people give you their ideas, you might enjoy 
their version so feel free to steal.  It’s your friends; they’re your 
family, right?  So steal their idea.  If they come up with something 
better, you go, “Damn it, I like that!” Next person, “Hey, I’m what 
he said.”  That’s kind of how you normally meet people, isn’t it?   
 
The only thing I’d like you to add onto what you’d normally do is 
something very simple. I just want you to give someone an 
expectation of something hypnotic, in other words, I’m here to 
demonstrate the power over the mind or I want to show people 
something really cool about how the mind works. I want to 
demonstrate hypnosis and how it’s so much more natural than 
people realize.  I don’t really care what you offer them but I want a 
seed of an expectation to be left inside the minds of the people that 
you meet and again, if someone plants a seed in your mind that you 
particularly like, steal it, right?  We’re not Hollywood here.  You will 
not get sued and go to jail for copying an idea and they happen to 
be copying movies, right?  So is that an easy task to do?  Yes, no, 
maybe so?   
 
You’ve met people before, right?  One’s like, oh, I don’t want to get 
up now.  So we’ll start this very gently, shall we?  Everyone, stand 
up.  Look around the room.  You’ll find there’s a lot of people here.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
27 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
You have about, I don’t know, let’s give you three-and-a-half 
minutes to meet everyone in this room and trade your three things; 
your name, your profession, I guess, and the expectation you want 
to leave inside their mind.  Off you go.   
 
Well, first of all, it sounds like you guys are having a great time, 
which is good.  Was meeting people such a hardship really?  No.   
 
Did you notice you felt a little bit like, oh, I don’t know, I’m going to 
stand up and do something, I didn’t like this.  But then when you 
actually get going, it’s actually relatively straight-forward, wasn’t it?  
Would that be fair to say?   
 
Audience Members: Yup. 
 
Igor: 
I just want you to think about that because that might possibly 
continue as a theme for the day.  I don’t know, I’m not saying you 
will but possibly.  Just keep it in the back of your mind.  So, so far 
you’ve introduced people.  Has anyone heard others come up with 
ideas in terms of what they were saying, in terms of, I’m a street 
hypnotist or whatever, the expectation or something that you liked, 
and you decided to steal?  Anyone?  The police are going to come 
for you guys in a minute.   
 
So it’s very straight-forward and do you notice how when 
someone’s speaking to you in this way, it kind of piques your 
curiosity a little bit, like, oh, what’s he got to offer; what’s he doing 
here, right?   
 
What I’d like to do now is just add a little piece to it, something 
you’ve already done but didn’t realize you were doing.  I’ll just 
make it a formal thing.  If all of you could just take a moment with 
your eyes open, with your eyes closed, I really don’t mind which 
way you do this, I want you to think of someone that you really 
love, someone that you feel comfortable in their presence, you 
trust them and you just feel good, like, if you were in a room full of 
strangers and you saw this one person, you’d make a bees line for 
them because you’d be on a private little island of protection 
because you know that person and you really like them.  Do you 
know what I mean?  Can you all think of someone like that?

Now, I’d like you to think about that person in a special way.  You 
may want to think about it in a specific context, the last time you 
saw them perhaps, something like that, but I want you to keep 
thinking about them or remembering that context or some good 
time you had with them until you begin to feel it.  This is the key.  
When you begin to feel that sense of pleasantness, that sense of 
comfort, that sense of trust, that sense of well-being, I’d like you to 
give me a signal just by clapping your hands together and keep 
rubbing them as long as you have that feeling.  Once everyone is 
clapping their hands and rubbing their hands, I’ll know that we can 
continue.   
 
So just keep rubbing them as you think of that person.  It’s just a 
little signal for me to know that you’ve got it, you’ve got that feeling 
and you’re there now and you’re thinking of a person that you 
really like.  Just keep rubbing your hands until everyone’s doing it, 
more or less.  Okay, good.   
 
And stop for a moment.  You hands should feel nice and warm now.  
They’re the hypno hands.  That was easy to do, wasn’t it?  It’s not 
rocket science, not difficult.  What I’d like to do is every single time 
you go into an exercise from now on, is I want you to go through 
exactly the same drill. 
 
Before you do an exercise, we’re going to do the same exercise 
again but before you do it, I want you to just think about a person 
you love and as you start feeling it, rub your hands a little bit and 
go, “Yeah, that feels good.”, and then go in and meet someone, 
shake their hand and say, “Hi, I’m Igor. I’m a street hypnotist.  I 
want to show people something really cool about how the mind 
works.”  That’s it, right?  Is that easy to do?  And then I’ll go to 
someone else and go, okay, just give a second – “Hi, I’m Igor, I’m a 
street hypnotist.  I show people really cool things they can do with 
their minds.”  All right?  Is that easy to do?  It’s only a simple little 
layer, but please get into the habit of this.  Make this a discipline.   
 
We’ll talk later about why we’re doing this and how this feeds into 
it, but feel the feeling, rub your hands a little bit and go, “Yeah, I 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
29 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
like this; this is good.”, and then you see people rub their hands and 
it’s like, “Oh, this is going to be a good one.” 
 
Anthony:  
 
“A Svengali, isn’t he?”   
 
Igor: 
“Oh, you’re mine, baby.”  Right?  If you want to have an evil 
hypnotist little rub as well, I don’t care; that’s fine, just as long as it 
stays the same each time.  Does that make sense, you guys?  All 
right, guys, let’s do the exercise again.  You’re going to still 
introduce yourself by name, by your title or profession, if you like 
and you will give them some little curiosity to think about in terms 
of what they can expect.   
 
The only thing you’re going to do before all that is get into your 
mind set, think of someone you really love and connect with, clap 
your hands, rub them a little bit, feel the feeling go, and then just 
go up and say, hey, right?  Don’t even think about the handshake, 
just go straight into from your rubbing hands, you’re in your little 
world and then just go straight into what you’re doing.  Is that easy 
to do?  It’s not rocket science, is it?  Off you go guys.   
 
Anthony: 
We’re going to stick with this intro bit.  I want to add a couple of 
points, give you a little bit of structure because as I said, for me, this 
is something I’ve had to learn and pay attention to.  For those of 
you who have read, there were some supplements to my book and I 
went over this on the Manchurian Approach DVD.  I just want to 
cover a few of the tips on this, what I’d call The Approach and my 
kind of system, this bit of walking up to people and getting them 
interested is what I call your approach.  Here’s a few tips.  One 
comes from a friend of mine, Cole Brook, he’s a mind reader by 
trade, he’s a trickster, but that’s his job title, mind reader.   
 
It doesn’t affect where he walks up to people on the street and 
says, “Have you got a purse or a wallet?  Excellent.  Do you mind 
taking a note out?”  He doesn’t touch it, he doesn’t look at it but he 
tells them the serial number on the note.  
 
Aside from the interesting method he uses to do that, as interesting 
is how do you get a complete stranger to take out their wallet or 
purse and remove a ten or twenty pound, a fifty pound note from 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
30 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
their purse?  And he said, that’s easy, I just say I’m a performer.  So 
he says, “Hi, excuse me, I’m a performer.”  If you say that, you have 
a huge amount of latitude to ask people to do ridiculous things, for 
a start.  I don’t mean pretend and role play. I mean, could you stand 
on one leg for me; could you just spin around three times for me, 
they will generally do it if you give them a justification and 
performer has that. It just gives you enough latitude.   
 
So don’t be afraid to say it.  You don’t have to say it but it will help.  
I say, I’m a performer and hypnotist.  It’s even more intriguing, 
gives me even more play.  You’ll find it easy to remember, the little 
acronym is ‘CIQ’, which means compliment, introduction and 
question.  Now what you’ve been doing so far is you’ve been 
saying, hi, I’m a street hypnotist and I’m excited; in fact, I’m more 
excited than you, and it’s good – no, it’s really good but we want 
some of that excitement to come from them. So what I’m looking 
for in a subject is a look of fascination, is a look of intrigue.  
 
If I approach a group, if I was to approach a group of eight people, 
then I am looking at you and I’m looking to the person who may be 
perfectly still, perfectly silent, not saying a lot, who’s absolutely 
riveted to everything I’m saying even if it’s, no, I don’t want to be 
hypnotized, as long as they’re locked onto me.   
 
To make this a little bit tougher, especially in a room full of men, 
what you’re going to do in the next practice is you’re going to give 
this person a compliment, right?  So, again, in the absence of 
anything else to do later on, if you’re feeling anxious on the street, 
use this:  Walk up to someone and give them a compliment, 
obviously not, great tits – 
 
Igor: 
Especially on a guy. 
 
Anthony: 
Any compliments, any compliment as long as it’s not physical or is 
going to sound like a cheesy pick-up line.  This could be any 
compliment at all.   
 
Igor: 
And don’t worry, we’ll help you refine that as we go along.  Just for 
a moment get them to say something nice. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
31 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Anthony: 
Let me give you a few examples:  If I was to walk up to this guy, I 
might say, they’re amazing shoes.  I’ve never seen any shoes like 
this before today but now I’ve seen two pairs, one of them in 
luminance yellow, but I might say, amazing shoes.  Or I could just 
say, great shirt, or I could say, you two look like an intelligent 
couple of guys; I could say, this table looks like this is where the 
party is; you guys look like you’re up for a laugh; you look like a 
couple of creative people.  It’s any compliment and I’m not looking 
to have a conversation on the back of that compliment.  I’m going 
to introduce myself on the back of the compliment.  How am I going 
to introduce myself?   
 
I’m going to say, I’m Anthony, I’m performing here.  I’m a hypnotist, 
and if any of you do magic or anything like that, I’ll say, I’m a 
magician, I’m a hypnotist.  If I’m just doing street hypnosis, I would 
just say, I’m a hypnotist.  I don’t necessarily say, street hypnotist.  I 
would just say, I’m a hypnotist. I’m performing in this square.  I’ve 
said, I’m performing on this street corner before.  There’s no one 
there, I’m standing outside of a kabob shop.  I’m performing here.  
But you say that, people’s ears prick up and they listen.  So I’m 
going to give a compliment, immediately I’m going to introduce 
myself, shake my hand, I’m going to look the person in the eye and 
say, I’m Anthony, I’m a hypnotist. I’m performing here.   
 
That’s the ‘I’ bit and then the ‘Q’ is a question.  So the question, 
again, just needs to be a question that’s going to open up 
conversation, and it could be related to what you want to do, and 
personally, I don’t want to stand round having a twenty minute 
lecture on hypnosis and hypnotherapy, so I’ll just say, can I show 
you some interesting, which is all a bit bland. You could say, what a 
guy said in Dublin last week when I was running a course, do you 
want to play some mind games; fantastic line, do you want to play 
some mind games?  He’s open, his body language is open, he’s got 
a smile on his face.  It’s like, who is this guy?  Do you want to play 
some mind games?  Have you ever been hypnotized? Have you ever 
wondered what it’s like to be hypnotized?  Can I show you how to 
harness the power of your own imagination?  Compliment, 
Introduction, Question.  So Robert, give me a compliment. 
 
Audience Member: That’s an absolutely awesome suit. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Anthony: 
Thank you.  Give me a compliment. 
 
Audience Member: I just love your thumb ring and your rings. 
 
Anthony: 
Oh, thanks a lot.  Give him a compliment, when you sat next to him. 
 
Audience Member: Fabulous watch. 
 
Audience Member: Oh, really. 
 
Anthony: 
Exactly.  It’s not that hard.  It’s not, oooh. It’s scary; she thinks I’m 
after - .  No, say something and again, for those of you who can kind 
of play it this way, then talking about things like, there’s just 
something special about you. 
 
There’s a great performer, his name is Jerome Findlay, he wrote an 
incredible book called Random Acts of Kindness and again, you 
don’t have to have an interest in magic and mentalism to 
appreciate some of his ideas.  It’s literally a book on how to do good 
things, make people feel good and one of his hooks is to open up a 
loop and just say, I’ve just got to say, when I was introduced to you, 
there’s just something about you, I can’t put my finger on what it is, 
and walk off at that point.   
 
That person has to come and find out what that is.  They have to 
know what’s special about them, even if you never quite find it.  I’m 
not saying we have to go down that road but all I’m saying is, by 
giving someone a genuine compliment, and it could be something 
they’re wearing, something they’re doing, a group of people, 
creative, arty, confident, fun, having a laugh, look like you’re up for 
some fun, that’s a compliment in my opinion.   
 
Introduce yourself solid, I’m Anthony, I’m a hypnotist, and open 
with a question.  Then you’ve got that response.  You’ve elicited a 
response.  One other thing based on this anchor.  
Remember, 
this is an anchor and obviously we’re going to drill this in, what I 
want you to do when you use this anchor is to do what you did the 
first time, just for a second, capture that person and then very 
deliberately do this with your hands.  What I noticed, and it’s 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
33 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
always the same when you set up anchors, is people start – it 
becomes another little life buoy to cling onto.  I’m rubbing my 
hands.  In a minute I’ll stop and I’ll shake someone’s hand.  So if 
you’re going to use an anchor, Find that state, find that feeling you 
have for that person, clap your hands together, rub your hands and 
then go and do what you’re going to do.  Otherwise you’re just 
going to dilute it back into – 
 
Igor: 
Nothingness. 
 
Anthony: 
Into nothingness, so just for a fraction of a second, find it, get the 
feeling, clap your hands, whatever else it is you’re going to do. Get 
used to giving people compliments.  Yes, this is another bit of the 
discomfort that we need to get over.  We’re just not used to it, 
especially if you’re English, we just don’t go around giving people 
compliments very often.  But once you do, you’re going to find this 
makes your life richer.  Since I’ve introduced this in my product, I’ve 
had numerous e-mails and messages, people saying, that thing has 
changed my life.  Well, that’s completely changed my performance 
because there’s no fear anymore.  You’re on top.   
 
You’re the alpha in this situation because you’re prepared to give a 
compliment but not be demanding that you go home with that 
person.  It’s just I’m just giving a compliment.  I’m that comfortable 
in my own skin that I can say nice things about people.  So get used 
to it. 
 
Igor: 
So let’s do a quick warm-up.  Everyone, I want you to just look at 
the person next to you, smile, make eye contact, smile, ask the 
person about the next exercise. Look at the front again. Everyone, 
look at the front again, just think of that person, someone you love. 
Everyone think of a person you love.  When you get the feeling, and 
not before, when you start getting that feeling, just do this, and 
lean over to the other person, shake their hand and say something 
nice.  It doesn’t matter what it is, just something nice.  Make them 
feel good about themselves.  Can you all do that?   
 
Go ahead and think that. Think about someone you love, as soon as 
you start feeling it, clap your hands, rub them a little bit, look at the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
34 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
next person, and whilst you have that feeling don’t think about it, 
just say something.   
 
How many of you found that saying something nice to someone 
becomes easier when you spend some time feeling good yourself 
first?  Anyone?  Right?  How many of you came up with a random 
compliment?  You didn’t choose it, it’s just when you were shaking 
hands, it just occurred to you?  How many of you did that?  Those 
are the best compliments.  Do you know why?  Because they’re 
genuine.  It’s very simple.   
 
So what I want you to do is, we’ll pause the whole meeting 
someone for a moment, I just want to get you into that habit and I 
want to – let’s just see, like Anthony was saying, he thinks it’s a 
great idea, is before you actually go up to someone, maybe just 
close your eyes just to give them a signal not to approach just yet. 
Just close your eyes for a second, feel inside, it’s so important, take 
that time out to feel decent inside yourself, then go, this is not bad. 
“Hey, how’s it going?”  Right?  “You look like a guy who likes to 
have fun.” 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
It’s easy, right?  It’s not rocket science but it is important that you 
don’t rush the process.  You have all the time in the world, guys.  So 
take it.  Easy to do?  So just that segment on its own and then we’ll 
start laying them on top of each other.  Off you go.   
 
Was that easy to do?  So why don’t we just do everything you’ve 
done so far and just put it all together, right?  So you’ll take a few 
minutes’ time out for yourself, take a deep breath, think of 
someone, go, oh, yeah, that’s the person, I like that person, oh, 
yeah.   
 
Then bring that sort of love vibe you have, that happy glowy feel 
and put it into your handshake, just shake someone’s hand and go, 
“Hey, my name is Igor. I’m a hypnotist. I’m performing here today.”  
I kind of like that.  That’s a nice little trick there, I’m performing 
here today. Then remember where you planted a seed before, like, 
I show people how to use their minds, or the power of the mind, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
35 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
something like that, just turn that into a question, into an offer, 
right?  Do you want to see how people use their minds better?  
Stand up for me, will you?  Do you see how easy that is?  It’s really 
everything you’ve been doing so far.  You’re just putting it together 
into a smooth sequence.   
 
Now, here’s a trick.  You know how everyone loves the Navy Seals 
because they’re cool and they do shit.  So now you can be like a 
Navy Seal hypnosis.  There’s a nice saying I’ve heard them say which 
I really like which is, slow is smooth and smooth is fast.  Right?  Your 
job is not to be going at a million miles an hour to get someone’s 
attention before they walk away.  Your job is to be so smooth that 
they can’t resist and just want to talk to you.  So take your time.  If 
that person passes by, no big deal, there’s another couple right next 
to him or there will be another three people over there or five 
people sitting at a table.  It’s no big deal.  Make sense?   
 
So just take your time, go over there, shake their hand, introduce 
yourself, give your whole hypnosis spiel, and just ask them a 
question. 
 
Anthony: 
Ask a question. 
 
Igor: 
Over them whatever it is, that seed you had before, just offer them 
that in the form of a question:  Would you like the power of the 
mind?  Would you like to see it?  Would you like to experience it?  
Or whatever, I don’t care.  And here’s a hint, if someone says 
anything you particularly like, steal it.  There’s no copyright in this 
room, only that camera right there.  All right, off you go guys.  So 
far, is that easy to do?  
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah?  The steps are easy, you’ve done the preparing yourself, little 
hand rub, just thinking, yeah, this is good, shake someone’s hand; 
you’re shaking his hand, is that easy to do?  Right?  Have you 
reminded them of who you are, like I said, give them a little 
compliment; make them feel good about themselves?  Have you 
told them who you are, give them your reason for being here – I’m 
a performer.  Have you asked them a little question like, do you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
36 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
want to learn about the power of the mind or see a demonstration 
of how powerful your mind really is?  Something like that?  Yes?  
Everyone done that? 
 
Audience Member: Mm-hmm. 
 
Igor: 
All right.  Should we add more bits? 
 
 
Body Language 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, I think the next bit to be aware of, and certainly not to get 
bogged down in is being aware of your body language and at this 
point I’m not talking about mirroring and matching and crossing 
your legs when they cross their legs and so on.  I’m just talking 
about being open, understanding that you really have a concept of 
personal space and no one’s particularly struck me as not being 
sensitive to that when we meet people, and you were all strangers 
a half an hour ago, or most of you.  We give each other some space, 
okay?  Where I actually want to be when I’m getting into the 
hypnosis and the induction – I won’t step forward too far – in fact, if 
you just stand up, where I want to be if I need to be is here, like 
this, and being absolutely and entirely comfortable with that. 
 
Igor: 
Notice how he’s invaded my boy space a little bit.  He has to be able 
to make it natural and easy. 
 
Anthony: 
So at first, obviously I can’t do that, I can’t just walk up to someone 
and get into that space but I need to get there and I need to get 
there in a couple of minutes sometimes.  So I’m going to start by 
generally being very open.  Let’s say this was a row of people sitting 
at a bar or you have a table of people, or an arc of people, rather 
than just sort of walk straight up to them, straight down the middle, 
I would generally just kind of glide in from the side and I’d try and 
catch as many eyes as I can and I’ll lock onto the person who I 
believe to be the more confident alpha in that group.   
 
It doesn’t have to be but someone who’s prepared to look at me, 
someone who’s already got my attention, okay?  My body language 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
37 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
when I go through this CIQ or whatever other intro approach I’m 
going to do is going to be like this.  It’s all a bit Tony Blair, to be 
honest.  It’s very much open:  I’m here; I’m vulnerable; here’s my 
core; there’s nothing to hide here. 
 
Igor: 
For the American’s in this room, Obama. 
 
Anthony: 
Well, yeah, but generally being open and gesturing and looking in 
people’s eyes, not giving them the hypnotic glare just yet but 
understand, people have this misconception it’s all about the eyes, 
you say the word, hypnosis, there will be some people who start to 
do that.  They’re probably going to be good subjects, so make a 
note.  One final tip on this, and I just find that people in their first 
experiences on the street often do this, is when someone at the 
table says, me, me, me, me, me, again, just to dive into the comfort 
zone of focusing on that person is a mistake because they don’t 
know if they’re a good subject, you don’t know, and neither does 
anyone else whether they’re going to be great at this.   
 
It is a numbers game.  So at this early stage and you’ll see when we 
get into the first exercises, I want to keep the numbers up; I want to 
keep speaking to everybody.  I’m not going to force people to do 
things if they don’t want to, but I’m going to try and keep people 
engaged.  Yes, I’ll make a note that that person is really keen, but I’ll 
say, I know you’re keen. I know you’re ready to be hypnotized. I’ll 
make a joke of it. It’s all the suggestion and I’ll keep everyone 
engaged as much as I can.  That’s all I really want to say on that. 
 
 
Igor: 
So let’s keep this very simple.  For a moment we’re not going to go 
into the whole group dynamic just yet just because we’ll go into 
that after the break.  Right now we just want to keep it very, very 
simple.  What you’re about to do is literally invisible.  You’re going 
to add something which is what Anthony was talking about, but it 
will be done invisibly in a way because all you’ll add is to make sure 
that while you’re talking to the other person and shaking their 
hand, you’re going to ask yourself, what’s my angle with them?  Am 
I kind of like, over here, kind of like, oh, leaning back and I go, oh, 
don’t talk to me, or are you kind of open?  Are you kind of like, hi? 
Right?  Just be aware of where you naturally are.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
38 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Now here’s a tip:  If you get this whole bit right, you’ll naturally just 
– you can’t help it, you’ll smile, your eyes will light up, your being 
will be opened up, your hands will be there, you might even want 
to grab their elbow or their shoulder or something like that because 
that’s how you work with your friends, isn’t it?   
 
How many of you approach your friends or people you really like 
and respect and feel comfortable and go, “H-hi, Billy.” Right?  
Unless you’re a friend with violent criminals which may be true, 
that’s not really how we approach people, is it?  So get that into 
your mindset and don’t think so much in terms of, what are my 
palms doing; what’s my head doing, and all that sort of stuff.   
 
Just notice where you are at and if that feeling gets stronger, do 
you open up more?  That’s an interesting question, isn’t it?  All 
right, guys, just spend five minutes doing that.  Off you go.   
 
Having fun? 
 
Audience Members: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Is this starting to make sense to you guys?  Is it making life a little 
easier?  Now I know we haven’t done any of the hypnosis elements 
for it yet but how much more confident or comfortable do you feel 
about the idea of approaching someone you don’t know and at 
least starting an interaction which can then become hypnotic?  
Hopefully you’re feeling a little more comfortable right now.  We 
haven’t all the pieces in place yet but that should be where you’re 
going towards.   
 
We’ll have a break in a moment.   
 
Just one thing I want to encourage you to think about, this idea of 
thinking of someone that you really feel connected to and so on. I 
want you to, when you meet someone, put it all into that 
handshake and that smile into those eyes, project as much as you 
can.  What that does is, I call it the H+ factor, and those of you who 
have trained with me before know this is the intense as I hypnotize, 
do something positive, but it also creates a lot of rapport.  What it 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

does, it tells your unconscious mind, sends signals of friendship to 
this other person.   
 
Now, I could talk to you about putting your hand like – right?  We 
can do all that stuff and there’s value for it.  If there was more time, 
it would be worthwhile exploring those elements and evolving that 
into a higher level skill but we don’t have that time to dedicate 
here. We have three days to get into the hypnosis and roll up our 
sleeves. So we want to hand that ability over to our unconscious 
mind.  The way we do that is the way we do that with everyone.   
 
Quick story before we have a break.  I remember at a seminar once, 
a little old lady comes in.  I can’t tell you why but she reminds me of 
my grandma.  Just something about her, I keep catching her in the 
corner of my eye, my grandma’s like – but I don’t know her.  I know 
that for a fact, right?  So halfway through the seminar she comes up 
and starts talking, says, have we met before?  Have you been to this 
seminar?  Have you been – she’d been to a lot of seminars, right?  
And I didn’t know her from anyone.   
 
The point though is, because something in me recognized 
something in her, or perhaps she’s not a her, that triggered those 
unconscious signals of recognition and you want that.  So when 
we’re sitting there going like – this is not just to make you feel 
good, although that’s a wonderful thing, it’s a shield for you as well, 
it’s the way we fundamentally connect with others.  Does that make 
sense to you guys?  So I’m going to encourage you, although we’re 
going to have a break now, we’re never at a break.  Someone 
encourages you in a break, whether you want to do this bit here or 
not, do the same thing with everyone you meet and chat on the 
break.   
 
Think about people you’re connected to and see if you can project 
that sense of connecting to the other person, of liking something 
inside them, someone they remind you of, something about them 
you feel connected to.  Does that kind of make sense to you guys?  
The more you practice this, the easier street hypnosis gets, 
guaranteed.  The more you leave this sort of falling in the 
background, naw; it will come at some point. That’s the risk you 
want to take, that’s fine, you can take that risk, but my personal

opinion is, I’m a big fat scaredy cat, don’t like taking risks so I 
wouldn’t.  Make sense?

How to Use the ‘Finger Vice’ to Find the Best 
Subjects to Work On 
 
 
More Street H+ 
 
Igor: 
These are the five steps that we are going to have you guys 
practice.  This is the secret to making Street Hypnosis easy.  Get this 
right, it’s all easy.  It’s really just a numbers game and it’s honestly 
harder to fail than to succeed.  Honestly.  If you get this wrong, 
well, then it’s potluck.  Good luck to you.  To get this right, it’s very 
straightforward.  Just make sure that you understand what you are 
trying to achieve at each step and you achieve it.   
 
 
 
1. H+ - Rub Your Hands 
2. Give a Genuine Compliment 
3. Tell them Your Name 
4. Tell them Your Role – Hypnotist & Entertainer 
5. Ask an Intriguing Question 
 
 
 
 
For example, the H+ Hands – remember where you think about 
someone you love, someone you’re connected to and you rub these 
things.  Someone was coming up during the break and said they 
have this feeling of anxiety, of nervousness whilst they were 
thinking of someone else as well.   
 
It’s kind of like blending together a little bit, and is that a problem?  
Clearly, it was for that person, right?  I’m guessing a few of you 
have had this similar sensation, is that right?  How would you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
41 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
resolve that? Any ideas?  Good.  The answer is very simple.  It goes 
right back to the fundamental principle.  Where attention goes, 
energy flows.  Now, if you have some anxiety left, that means you 
have some attention left over to think about things that you don’t 
want to have happening, which means you are not concentrating 
enough on what you do want to have happening.  This, by the way, 
is going to help you immensely in Street Hypnosis.  The reason the 
arm will bend, the reason the fingers won’t come together is 
because part of their attention is on something other than your 
instructions.   
 
Really.  That’s it.  So you fix it inside yourself, you’ll know exactly 
how to fix it inside someone else.  Do you want to know how to do 
that the easiest way?  Get really specific.  Those of you – how many 
here were thinking about someone they love, but in general terms?  
There are many different events, possibilities, and so on.  Anyone?  
Right.  Who was thinking about a specific event, a specific moment 
in time?  So there was a specific moment in time where x was there 
and you were there and it was just a great day.  The more specific 
you get, the easier it is for your attention to rest in that.  In other 
words, try and pull back details.  Where were you?  Who were you 
with?   
 
Who was around?  What other things were there?  What were the 
objects in the room?  How did you feel?  The more you get involved 
in that mental scene – you don’t actually need to see it, just think 
about it.  The more your attention is absorbed by the experience 
and there’s nothing left for anything else?  Does that make sense?  
Go ahead and try that for a moment.  I want you to try – think 
about for a moment, just as an experiment, a full experiment, I 
want you think about doing something slightly embarrassing on the 
street, like oh, I don’t like it.  Right?  Everyone happy about that?  
No?  Good.  Now, I want you to half think about someone you like.   
 
Just kind of vaguely think, “Oh yeah, that’s John,” while still thinking 
about the thing on the street.  Doesn’t go away, does it?  The 
anxiety is still there, isn’t it?  So now I want you to think about that 
person, let’s call him John for now.  It could be a male, a female.   It 
doesn’t matter.  I want you to ask yourself some specific questions.  
How do you know this person?  When are you thinking of?  What 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
42 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
specific context?  What day of the week was it, perhaps?  What was 
he or she wearing?  How do they look?  Can you remember what 
shoes they were wearing?  Doesn’t matter if you can’t, just think 
about it.  Do you remember the shoes?  How did you meet each 
other?   
 
In other words, did you give each other a hug?  Did you shake 
hands?  Just say hi on the phone?  How did you start that meeting?  
How do you feel when you are around that person, in that context 
and maybe in general as well?  As you are considering all this, what 
has happened to the previous emotion?  Receded?  Disappeared?  
Right?  It’s because your attention is somewhere else.  What we 
need to do is – this is where a little bit of mental discipline comes 
in, right?  You can either have a mental laxness, if you want, and 
scare yourself.  By all means, go ahead.  If you enjoy it, people like 
roller coaster rides, right?  Or you can use a little bit of mental 
discipline and focus more.   
 
The irony is – have you noticed when you are anxious you’re 
attention becomes more locked on something?  Right, have you 
ever noticed that?  So your focus actually increases, you get to 
hijack it.  You feel the anxiety.  Instead of pushing it away and going, 
“No, I don’t want you.”  Feel it good and there it is and “Yep.  I 
definitely don’t want that.”  Now, focus all that attention that 
person that you love, that you respect, you admire, that you feel 
connected to, and it will begin to transform.  It should be happening 
right now.  Is it?  Or is it not?  You’re hijacking your fear rather than 
letting it hijack you.   
 
You’re not trying to push anything away.  You’re not trying to make 
it recede.  You want whatever that fear gives you, which is that 
focus, that attention.  All you want to do is move the focal point a 
little degree to the left or to the right, so it focuses on what you 
want now, which is a person you generally love and put all your 
attention on that.  Does that make sense to you guys?  Do you see 
that it can be quite involved?   Sometimes you might spend two 
whole minutes going like, “Oh, got it.  Now, I get it.”  Right?  Keep 
yourself in that state of mind as you rub those hands and go, “Yeah, 
I really like John.”  Hey, you look like a person who likes to have fun, 
and have crazy alien music coming from the background.

My name is Igor.  I’m a Street Hypnotist.  I’m performing here 
today.  Can I show you something really cool about how your mind 
works?   
 
Anthony: 
Let’s do it. 
 
Igor: 
All right.  Do you see how that whole vibe gets transferred?   
 
Anthony: 
And this becomes acceptable as well.   
 
Igor: 
Well, of course, it does.  I’m not even thinking about how I’m 
touching another man.  I don’t think about it.  This is natural to me.  
Believe me I’m not a natural person to touch people I don’t know.  
I’m not sitting here going, “Alright, Geezer.”  They’ll go, “What the 
hell?”  Because I’m thinking of someone I generally like – I’m 
connected to them, so on, and saying, “Do you mind if I show you 
something?”  It’s a natural touch.  Most people won’t even notice 
that it is there.  It’s part of the communication.  If you are awkward, 
they’ll be awkward.  If you’re natural, they’ll be natural.  The easiest 
way to be natural is to put your attention somewhere that is 
natural.  Does that make sense to you guys? The rest becomes easy.   
 
An emotional compliment – I don’t mean like, “Nice shoes.  Nice 
tie.”  That’s fine, but they are low level compliments.  The best 
compliments are the ones about your character, aren’t they?  
Right?  You look like you guys are having a lot of fun here, right?  I 
need people who want to have fun.  I’m a Street Hypnotist.  I’m 
performing here today.  Let me show you something about how you 
can turn that fun to really unleash the power of your mind.  Would 
you like that?  Right?  Or, you guys look interesting.  I’m a hypnotist, 
I’m performing here today.  Can I show you something that is 
equally interesting?  Right?  I’m I saying anything really?  I’m not, 
but then, you are interested in them in some respect.  The point is 
you don’t have to come up with a compliment ahead of time.  As 
you go and shake their hand, just say what comes to mind.  The 
more abstract it is, the more real the compliment is.  It is kind of 
weird, right?  You have an interesting smile.  I’m a hypnotist.  I have 
something interesting too.  I’m performing here today.  Can I show 
you my interesting thing?

Anthony: 
Okay. 
 
Igor: 
See how naturally that fits the conversation?   
 
Anthony: 
Yes.  Naturally, go for it. 
 
Igor: 
I love working with hypnotists.   
 
Anthony: 
It’s great.  It’s true.  You try and – certainly you want to get beyond 
this and into the other techniques.  I’m trying to raise the level of 
emotion that the subject is experiencing before we actually we get 
to the sleep and the hypnosis and the everything else.  Giving 
someone is a compliment about their character; something that is 
going to make the feel warm, good, connected is good.  It doesn’t 
have to be cheesy and creepy, just being a human a being who is 
seeing good things in other people.  Try and see something good or 
beautiful in this person and be prepared to say it. 
 
Igor: 
It’s a good mental discipline to get into anyways, isn’t it?  To see 
something in other people worth respecting, worth admiring, isn’t 
it?  I think as a general rule for life, it is a pretty good one.  Not only 
do you become a kick ass Street Hypnotist, you become a better 
person too.  Yay.  So these are pretty straight forward, right?  They 
may require a little bit of getting involved and so on.  Who here 
can’t say their own name? 
 
Audience Member: Me, sometimes. 
 
Igor: 
You sometimes?  All right.  I’ll give you a full frontal lobotomy, so 
then at least you will have a proper excuse for later.  Your role is 
pretty straightforward at this point.  Finally the question at the end 
is important because it hooks them in.  It intrigues them.  You’ll 
basically want to offer them an experience, right?  Has anyone here 
been on holiday?  Do you go on holiday just to be on holiday or do 
you go on holiday for the experience of it?  Right?  If I give a 
postcard of a beautiful beach, you go, “No, that is not quite what I 
meant.”  If I show you a video of elephant trecking – why is it that 
other people holiday videos are so boring?  It’s because you don’t 
have the experience.  To them, it is great because they are reliving 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
45 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
their experience, but it means nothing to you.  People thrive on 
experiences.  Offer them an experience.  Depending on how they 
are responding – if they are a little bit nervous, you are going to say, 
“Let me show you some really unusual experiences about your 
mind.”  Is unusual a good thing?  What if they are more little funky, 
beatnik, like they are too cool for cats?  Like they have seen it all?  
They are like, “What are you going to do?”  Do you want me to 
show you something unusual?   
 
Anthony: 
I’m not really into magic.   
 
Igor: 
You’re not really into magic?  Well, I am going to show you 
something unusual about how your mind works.  Something that 
you have never seen before, you up for this?  See now, you have 
begun to offer the bit of intrigue according to their character.  It 
could be unusual, exceptional, something cool, and something fun.  
Whatever the vibe you come in with, you’re into it.  If they are 
having fun, hey, let me show you something fun.  Guess what?  
They are already having fun, aren’t they?  If they are still a bit shy, 
let me show you how to become a stronger person just through the 
power of your mind.  It’s a pay off, isn’t it?  Do you see where we 
are going with this?   
 
Anthony: 
Later on in the course we’re going to talk about giving people gifts.  
I’m not going to go into that with too much detail. It relates to what 
we mentioned earlier about random acts of kindness.  Sometimes 
dangling a kind of carrot over a potential gift would be my question.  
I’ve hypnotized people on the street with a sign, “Pizza Hut this 
way,” or “golf sale this way.”  How long are you got to stand there 
for?  Eight hours.  If I can make that fly by in an hour, would that be 
good?  Yeah, of course, it would.  I’m a hypnotist.  Can I show you 
something?  Yeah.  Look at that screw.  But then there is something 
there now.  There’s a bit of hook.  Do you do sport?  You look after 
yourself.  Yeah, I still play five aside.  If I could show you how to be 
absolutely focused, virtually in a couple of minutes, would that be 
interesting?  Sure.  Then I’ll get into whatever it is that I want them 
to do.  I don’t mind.  It’s not a lie, but little white lies to kind of hook 
people in.  I know I’ll make them feel good in the end.  I know I’ll 
give them the gift of being able to tap in to their resources in the 
end.

Igor: 
It is just you warm up differently. 
 
Anthony: 
Don’t think about it too hard.  Just a question that elicits a 
response.  Something where even if it is, “No way, you can’t do 
that,” or “I don’t believe in it,” or “that sounds scary.”  It doesn’t 
matter that much because you’ve thrown the ball to them with that 
question and they’ve now thrown it back.  So now, it’s my turn 
again. 
 
Igor: 
You have some feedback, so you know where to go from that point, 
right?   
 
Anthony: 
Exactly, exactly. 
 
Igor: 
Anthony said the magic words, this is not something you put a lot of 
effort into.   The point is you’re at this stage, you’re still having a 
cool chat with them.  You’re instinct will guide you, will tell you, 
well, what does this person need?  Do they need something fun?  
Will they enjoy that?  Do they need something more calming?  
Would they enjoy that? How I can be of service to this person?  
How can I enhance their experience right now?  That will depend on 
the person that you are with, won’t it?  The good news is that you 
all have instincts.  Anyone here have a friend?  I actually once asked 
that question and one person said no.  I went really?   
 
He had other issues as well, so that one left my vocabulary for a 
while.  I’m back again.  Hopefully, you all have friends, right?  The 
point is, if you all have friends, you can kind of read them a bit.  You 
know what they need at one point or another in time.  That’s the 
instinct that I’d like you to foster with them.   
 
 
Approach a Group 
 
Igor: 
So what I’m going to do now is the same exercise that we did a 
moment ago, where you introduced, you got your H+ ready.  You’ve 
given some sort of compliment.  You are going to give your name, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
47 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
your role, offer some intrigue.  Only this time, I’d like to get into 
groups of three, one hypnotist and two friends just casually 
chatting.  If perhaps, Alex, you are going to have a chat with 
Anthony: for a moment, just come up here.   
 
These guys are just chatting and I’m getting myself ready here.  You 
can do exactly the same thing as before.  The same five steps.  Now 
there’s two people and they both need your love vibe. They do. 
Share it.  Don’t be mean.  Share it equally.  You’re sitting there and 
you’re thinking of someone.  In case you are wondering who it is for 
me, I don’t know why, but I keep thinking about my pet dog when I 
was a kid at school.  It was just a good friend.  Maybe I had no 
friends, I don’t know.  Anyway, so, I’m thinking about that.  I’m 
feeling great.  I’m going, "Hey guys, you look like interesting people 
here." My name is Igor.  I’m a hypnotist.  I’m performing here on 
the streets today.   
 
I want to show you guys something about how cool the mind really 
is, a power that is untapped.   Do you think you have some 
untapped potential inside somewhere?  Let’s find out.  Just stand 
up over here a second.  Do you see what just happened there?  I 
walked in.  I put a little bit of a spiel in.  I’ve given an intriguing 
question. And then I’m going to get into the whole compliance 
thing, but it doesn’t really matter.  The point is that it’s starting to 
lead somewhere now, isn’t it?  Do you see that?  Is that any 
different to what you have been doing all morning?  No.  There is 
just more people.  I’m not going like, “I want to show you 
something,” and he’s not going, “who the hell is this guy?”   
 
I didn’t go, “Hey Alex and you, I don’t like you.”  I’m now going to 
be normal social person, who is going, “Hey guys, I’m performing 
here today.”  I’m looking at you a little bit.  I’m looking at you a little 
bit.  I’m sharing that positive vibe that I’m feeling.  They’re going to 
give me enough time to get my thing out because they are going to 
be curious.  Like are going to be like, “Who is this cool, too cool for 
cats person, standing there in front of me, going, “Yeah, I like the 
cut of your jib.”  Does that make sense?  Is that easy?  Go ahead.  
Find yourself groups of three and just give each person a sense of 
that.  It really should only take thirty seconds, a minute at best.   If 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
48 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
you are still there five minutes later still rolling, that’s called your 
fear talking.  You’re not doing your job. 
 
Anthony:   
You’re right.  Your aim is not get into a conversation about 
hypnosis.  We’re going to talk about what comes next after this 
question.  Literally a few sentences that are going to act as your pre 
hypno discussion, or your pre-talk if you’re from the stage or done 
any therapy work, you know that that can be lengthy.  It can be five 
minutes, ten minutes, half an hour, fifty minutes.  On the street, 
you want to boil this down to a few sentences.  It is going to come 
immediately after this question.  We are going to start to get into it.  
Can you stand there?  Can you do this?  Can you do that?  The other 
thing that you need to do and we are just about at this point, is to 
field any question – anything that comes in, you just need to boof, 
you just need to push it out of the way.  You need to just kick its 
legs away instantly.  That’s a bit scary.  No hypnosis - I’m a 
Christian.  I might get stuck in it.  No, you’ll humiliate me.  In a 
sentence, you need to be able to undo any of those questions.  I’m 
not that kind of hypnotist.  This will be an amazing experience.   
 
Igor: 
Trust me.  It will be very easy.  We’ll do a whole set of drills on just 
that on its own.  For a moment, can you start that group dynamic a 
little bit?  It’s really what we’ve been doing already; it’s just upping 
the ante a bit.  It might be more nerve wracking because it is two 
people now.  You can actually find the same exact routine works.  
The key here as Anthony was saying is don’t over speak it.  You’re 
trying to say the least amount to get to the point where they’re 
saying, “Sure.”  Don’t give any objections as yet, folks.  The 
objections element and how to handle that will come next.  For the 
moment, just get them to the point where they are going, “Sure.”  
Just be nice, friendly, normal, everyday people.  That’ll give people 
a chance to experience what that would be like.   
 
Anthony: 
One final point, I know that we really are drilling this approach stuff 
in, but as Igor said, this is eighty percent of what – not of what 
you’re going to learn, but it’s eighty percent of the difficulties 
you’re going to overcome.  Another reason we’re going over this 
here, so you get entirely comfortable with this, is because your job 
is not just to approach and introduce yourself.  Your job is, while 
that is happening, to observe and to start to manage people and to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
49 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
start to see who is the person in this group I need to control a little, 
who is the person on the periphery looking interested.   
 
Obviously, the more you do it, the more your words flow naturally, 
the more attention you’ve got left to look, into their eyes and 
observe their face, watch their breathing and all this other fine 
detail that you can get into.  For now, just try and get as 
comfortable as you can with this process.  If there are people you 
haven’t spoken to yet, do your best to speak to them.  If you see 
certain people and for whatever reason you’ve got it into your head 
that they might be tougher to speak to, go and speak to them.  This 
is the place to fail.  This is the place to get a bit of egg on your face.  
It is not going to happen because we’re a tribe, so let’s just get 
practicing again. 
 
Igor: 
Up on your feet everyone and just literally thirty seconds to a 
minute maximum.  Do it all the way around and we’ll be back in 
three minutes.   
 
 
All right, this is getting better.  Now one quick fix.  I may ask you 
both at the same time, all right?  One quick fix here is all you guys 
are doing this, “Hi.  How are you doing?”  Where is the 
responsibility of that conversation now?  On the other person, 
right?  You just basically handed the ball over to them.  It is like 
saying, “Hi.  How are you doing?”  Now, it is in their control.  If they 
don’t know what to expect, what’s going to happen, you’re being 
very unfair to them to force them to be interactive.  That’s why we 
do it, by the way.   
 
So all I do here is be polite to them, run the conversation and make 
the answer for them to give you very easy.  For example, “Hi!  You 
look like a fun person.  I’m a hypnotist.  I’m performing here today.  
I’d like to show you something really fun about the power of the 
mind.  Do you want to play this game?”   
 
Audience Member: Cool, yah. 
 
Igor: 
Now, notice that the only question I asked them was a simple 
question to ask, “Do you want to play?”  “Are you ready to have 
some fun?”  “Do you want to learn something about the mind?”

“Can I show you this?”  It’s a very simple yes/no question that 
makes it easy on them.  I haven’t done that until the end until there 
is a reason to say yes.  Does that make sense? 
 
Anthony: 
There are quite a few of you doing that.  Even starting well, “You 
look like an interesting guy.  Is that right?”  It’s the same thing, just 
giving it away at a different stage.  You’re not here to have a 
conversation at this point.   You’re here to finish your approach.  
Compliment, but you don’t have a chat about that compliment.  
Your introduction, that is not the beginning of the conversation; 
that is you stating a fact and setting the playground.  “I’m a 
hypnotist.  You speak to me; you are going to get hypnotized.”  
That’s how it’s going to go.  That’s what I am saying when I say, “Hi, 
I’m a hypnotist.”  You carry on speaking to me that is where this is 
going to lead to. If I said, I’m a mind reader.  You’d expect that at 
some point, I’m going to start reading minds.  “Hi, I’m a hypnotist.  
I’m Anthony.  I’m performing here.  Do you want to play some mind 
games?  Can I show you something interesting?”  Yes, at that point, 
we are handing the ball and they could just say, “No, thank you.”  At 
least we’ve done our bit.  We’ve completed it.  We haven’t given 
them an out.  Because, trust me, especially if you’re not – a. if 
you’re not from England and b. if you’re not from London, if you ask 
people, “Hey. How are you doing?,” you’ll get, “All right” - if you’re 
lucky.   
 
Igor: 
That is a very talkative person.   
 
Anthony: 
There’s no point entering at that level because most people here do 
not know what to do, we are socially inept.  That’s just the way it 
goes, so you’re going to help them out with that by giving them 
something interesting to respond to.   
 
Igor: 
Simple, yes/no, questions.  Binary, no choices, no qualities, just, 
“Sure, I’ll go along with this.”  It’s as simple as that.  Now, to add 
something else – do you have a question? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah, do you find that – I find that the handshake is too, for me 
personally, is too early.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
51 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Then don’t shake the hand.  If the handshake doesn’t seem right at 
the time, then don’t shake it.  Go with your instincts.  Don’t worry 
the streets will break you of any bad habits pretty quickly.  Don’t do 
the handshake right now.  Go with whatever your instincts say.   
 
Anthony: 
And if that was the case, it is not that you have to shake hands.  It’s 
not – we’re not in France.  It is not a completely normal thing to 
shake hands every time you meet someone here.  However, that 
said, I want to get into this person’s personal space at some point.  
I’m still very open, I’m still absolutely open at this point.  If I hadn’t 
done that, if I hadn’t shaken hands and I couldn’t get to people, 
once I get past this intro, I would say, “What is your name?”  Even 
then, I’m going to try and make my first touch.  When we get to the 
next stage, the exercises you’ll see that there are lots of other 
similar opportunities to make adjustments, to just stand and get the 
whole compliance thing going. 
 
Igor: 
I rarely shake their hands until half way through the interaction 
anyway.  Just go with your instincts.  Don’t concern yourself too 
much with these rules because you’ll get overloaded.  Just big 
friendly smile, if you’re going to shake the hand, great.  If you don’t, 
that’s fine too.  The point you’re getting to, is you’re getting this 
whole thing down in like ten or fifteen seconds now, right?   
 
 
Handle Resistance 
 
Igor: 
So what we’re going to at the end of this is for the person being 
approach to add one simple objection like, “Hypnosis?  That’s 
scary,” or “I can’t be hypnotized.”  Whatever you’re afraid that 
someone might say to you – only one thing, throw it out there.  
Only one for now.   
 
You’re job as a hypnotist, as soon as they say that, is smile like you 
hear it all the time because, let’s face it, you will.  Have one 
sentence to turn it around.  For example, “Oh, I’m not that kind of 
hypnotist,” or “this is fun hypnosis.  I’m not like evil Svengali.”  
Whatever it is, you make a joke of it.  You make light of it.  You want 
to put it to rest, but in one sentence only.  You don’t want to be 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
52 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
pulling out your bible of hypnosis and saying, “Chapter One.  Verse 
One.  Sayeth the Lord, hypnosis beith good for people.”  We don’t 
need to go to that level of detail.  One objection.  One simple 
reframe in one sentence and then you could change the interaction 
the other way.  We’re now starting to build up into the actual 
routine.  Does that make sense?  Off you go. 
 
 
The whole introduction only takes a minute on the streets.  This 
should not be taking more than thirty or forty seconds, including 
this little intro.  Now, Anthony has his version.  I’ll happily give you 
mine.  We’ll both give you ours.  You can add or take what you want 
or not at all.  It’s up to you.  I like to give them like a one line 
sentence say, “Hypnosis is nothing more than harnessing the power 
of your mind.  All I need from you is focus, your attention, and your 
imagination.  Can you focus?” 
 
Anthony: 
I’ll do my best. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s find out.  Now, am I’m ready to start some kind of routine?  
Let’s find out.  There’s the challenge.  Can I focus?  Have you any 
imagination?  I don’t know.  Well, let’s find out.  Do you see how 
that opens a door up?  Now you don’t have to use that, it’s just an 
example of where you can go.  Do you want to give them yours? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, again I’ll field any questions as I said.  “I’m not that kind of 
hypnotist.”  “You’ll have my complete respect.”  You going to make 
me take my trousers off? “No, of course not.”  All this kind of stuff.  
What’s important at this point, as we get into these exercises, is 
cooperation.  You’ve got to understand that a percentage of people 
out there believe their role, as the subject, as the hypnotee, is to do 
the opposite of what you are asking them to do.  It’s not everybody, 
but there is a portion of people who misunderstand what their role 
is.  Their role is to cooperate.  That does not mean pretend.  It 
means I’ll say this, “This is great.  I want to get as many of you 
involved as possible.   
 
I’d like you all to do this.  Understand, hypnosis is not me making 
you do things.  I’m going to ask you to use your imagination, 
literally, if I ask you to picture something or imagine something, do 
your best to imagine it.  If I want you to get a feeling for something, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
53 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
do your best to find that feeling.  Is that okay?  Excellent.  Can you 
put your feet on the floor?  Can you stand like this?”  And I’m into 
it.  I’m trying to communicate without saying “Pretend.”  I’m saying, 
“I need you to cooperate. This is about you.  I want you to use your 
imagination.  I want you to experience the power of your mind.  
That means using what you have already got.  If I ask you to imagine 
something, do your best to imagine it.   
 
If I ask you to get a feeling for something, do your best to feel it.  
You’ll have an amazing experience.”  Sell it with a sentence or two 
or three sentences.  That’s generally how I do it.  Try and get 
everyone on board about understanding their role is to be involved.  
You can quickly kill off some of the misconceptions even if they 
haven’t come up.  “Understand that hypnosis isn’t sleep. I may say 
the word ‘sleep’, but you won’t be asleep like you are at night.  
You’ll be able to hear what I’m saying.  You’ll be aware of your 
surroundings.  You’re perfectly safe.”  That kind of stuff. 
 
Igor: 
 The key here is guys, again, please don’t take more than fifteen or 
twenty seconds.  It is a very simple intro.  On the streets, your 
instincts will tell you if you need to go on a little bit more or a little 
bit less.  For the moment, we just want to get that system rolling.  
The key idea you are getting across is, this is not a challenge, this is 
a cooperation.  This is an exploration.   
 
Anthony: 
This is an opportunity for them.  
 
Igor: 
Do you see there’s a different framework other than the challenge?  
I’m going to try and make you do something and you’re going to try 
and resist.  You don’t want to get into that mindset.  It’s more like, 
“Let’s see how powerful your mind is.  Let me show you how 
powerful your mind is.  Let’s see how well you can focus.  Let’s see 
where your imagination can take you.  Have you ever let your 
imagination run away with you?  Watch what happens when you 
do.”  You see what you’re doing?  You’re now having a cooperation 
frame rather than a challenge frame.  Does that make sense to 
everybody?   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
54 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Anthony: 
Let’s just give you one example.  “Hi.  How are you doing?  I’m 
Anthony,  I’m performing here today.  I’m a hypnotist.  Can I show 
you something interesting?” 
 
Audience Member: Sure. 
 
Anthony: 
Do you know anything about hypnosis?  You’ve ever been 
hypnotized?  Okay, well look, hypnosis is about cooperation.  I need 
you to use your imagination and I need you to concentration on the 
things I ask you to concentrate on.  Are you up for doing that? 
 
Audience Member: I’ll give it a go. 
 
Anthony: 
Okay.  Great stuff.  Can you just place your feet together for me?   
 
Igor: 
Right into the whole routine now.  You see that?  How long did that 
take?  Thirty, forty seconds?  It is not really that long, is it?  Don’t 
get into this habit of speaking too much,  that’s just your nerves 
talking.  Say as little as possible to move on to the next step.  If the 
next step gets resistance, just go back and do the first step a little 
bit longer.  Easy?  Back into your groups for a Take One.  It’s the 
whole shebang up until you’ve had your little pre-talk.  Off you go.   
 
Igor: 
All right, guys.  You may have noticed that we’re pushing.  We’re 
putting a little pressure on you now, we’re pushing the pace a little 
bit now, everyone noticing this?  There’s a reason for this because 
there will be more pressure out there than in here.  So we may as 
well let the pressure build up here.  So when you are okay with this, 
you’ll be okay with that.  It makes sense, doesn’t it?  Somewhere.  
 
Anthony: 
The thing you should be most scared of at this point is us saying, 
“Yes, do me.”  You’re going to know where to go in the next little 
while.   
 
 
Compliance Tests 
 
Igor: 
So now what I want to do is add the next little piece and it’s really 
simple, right?  It’s called Compliance Testing.  You want to make 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
55 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
sure that these people are doing what you want them to do.  
Remember we only have time for one person per group.  So what 
we are going to do is say, “Have a seat over here, would you?  Take 
your hands out of your pocket, would you?  Now, look at me.”  
Those are three actions I asked him, weren’t they?  Three simple 
actions.  I’m testing to see how well he responds.  If he does that 
me and I’m getting all recalcitrant – 
 
Anthony: 
Can you just put your feet together for me?   
 
Igor: 
Why?  
 
Anthony: 
Just – 
 
Igor: 
Where is he?  Is he in a good place right now?  No.  Is he going to 
start his hypnosis thing right now?  No.  He’s got to change the 
frame.  For the moment, we’re being nice to each other, but we’re 
looking for these things.  If he does the same thing again – 
 
Anthony: 
Will you just put your feet together for me?  Yeah, just place your 
feet together like this.  That is perfect. 
 
Igor: 
Notice what just happened there.  I was being hesitant and he is 
showing me how he’s expecting me to respond.  Not directly.  He’s 
not going, “Be a little less hesitant.”  Sometimes I’ll make a joke 
about it, if they are really hesitant.   But he’s really just saying 
physically, “No. No.  Like this.  Foot over there.  There you go.”  He’s 
giving you a very nonchalant way of saying, “This is how I expect 
you to respond, quickly, smoothly, easily, no thought.”  Does that 
make sense?  Do you see how he just took control of the situation? 
I don’t want to have any hesitation yet, I just want to have two or 
three acts of compliance.  “Stand there.”  “Look here.” “Do this.”  I 
don’t care what they are and observe them. 
 
Anthony: 
One little point and we might as well build it in at this stage without 
getting too hung up on complex language patterns, use phrasing, 
“Would you?  Could you?  Would you place your feet together?”  
“Would you stand here?”  Would you just look up here for a 
moment?”  Would you?  Could you?”  It doesn’t sound like a 
command, but it is. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
56 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
You can even add the word, please.  “Please, stand here.”  It makes 
it a little easier than, “Just stand there.”  Again, it’s your whole 
mannerism, your whole attitude, right?  You’re softening it.  As far 
as they are concerned, they’ve just said yes to an experience.  Now 
you’re going to set them up for the experience, of course they’re 
going to comply.  It’s really a no brainer.  So this is more for you to 
make sure that if  there’s anything you haven’t flushed out yet, itss 
time to flush it out.  
 
Anthony: 
Beyond that confident intro, “I’m Anthony, I’m a hypnotist.”  This is 
really the next point for you to sell your expertise.  They’re going to 
begin to know that you are an expert because clearly it’s important 
that you have your feet together.  It must be important that you 
have your hands out of your pockets.  They don’t know why.  As you 
know, some of you work in magic and mentalism, that kind of thing.  
This is known as the witch doctor effect.  It is just the more 
emphasis you put on something, the more they’ll start to attach 
some value.  It must be relevant that my hand is stiff or my arm is 
locked out.  They’ll attach some meaning to that.  At this point, “can 
you place your feet together?  Would you stand here like this?  Can 
you look up at that spot?  Don’t look at me. Don’t look anywhere 
else,” is all saying, I’m in control.  I know what I’m doing.  It’s a lot 
more than just getting compliance here.   
 
Igor: 
Would you just turn and face me for a minute, just make sure you 
have a line of sight and “Put your feet so they’re parallel, not quite 
touching and let your hands just shake loose on the side.  Look at 
me and smile.  Can you do that?”  That’s as easy as that.  Notice 
how there’s an expectation there, it looks like I’m about to do 
something.  That’s the expectation that you want to build inside 
people.  That’s all we need to do for the moment.  We’re going to 
do the whole thing again from, “Hi guys, you like” – some of you are 
forgetting these compliments – “You look like you’re having fun.  
Great.  I’m a hypnotist, I’m performing here today. I need some fun 
people, I want to show you some really cool things that your minds 
can do.  Are you up for this?” 
 
Anthony: 
You’re not going to make me take my trousers off, are you? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
57 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Of course, not.  I’m not that kind of hypnotist.  I’m the good kind, 
like the good fairy.  Hypnosis is really all about you.  It’s about 
accessing the power of your mind and harnessing it, just with 
simple tools like your focus and your imagination.  Tell me, can you 
focus? 
 
Anthony: 
Little bit. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s find out.  Stand right here then.  Put your feet together.  That’s 
right.  Nice and tight.  Shake your hands out.  Look at me.  Do I have 
compliance to have a good subject beginning to build up?  Right?  
Now I have everything in my favor.  That is all I want you guys to do.  
Is that easy? 
 
Anthony: 
It’s easy. 
 
Igor: 
Off you go.   
 
Igor: 
Who’s starting to feel a little bit more confident now?  It’s starting 
to get there now.  Well, let’s do something kind of hypnotic now. 
You’re always going to start at the beginning with yourself, a big 
smile, a compliment like, “Hey you look like a cool person.  I want to 
show you something cool.  I’m a hypnotist.  I’m performing here.  I 
like to show people the power of their minds.” 
 
Anthony: 
I’m a little bit of control freak, does that matter? 
 
Igor: 
Oh, that is perfect.  You’ll be able to focus on things.  The more you 
focus on things that I’m suggesting, the more you’ll be able to 
control the outcome that your mind is going to give you, all right?   
 
What you need to do is use the focus of attention where I ask you 
to direct it and your imagination.  That’s simple to do, isn’t it?  Do 
you want to find out about how powerful your mind really is?  
Stand over here, would you?  Put your feet together.  Put your 
hands out.  That’s it, on the side.  Now, what I want you to do is 
bring your hands up like this.  Say, “Yes, Master.”  Sometimes it’ll 
happen.  Now, if they say “Yes, Master,” you smile and say, “You’ll 
be a good subject.  I like this.”  Sometimes I like to make a little joke 
of this.  What I want you to do is focus on your hands, the sensation 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
58 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
of your hands when they come together like that.  Can you do that?  
You can feel those hands together.  That’s it.  Is that easy to do?  
We just added two steps of what we’ve already done which is 
hands out, hands together, locked and tight.   
 
Anthony: 
Some of you will know this as a ‘Yes Set’.  Those with a sales 
background or you’ve got a NLP background.  What I’m looking for 
when I say, “Can you place your feet together?”  Can you put your 
hands by your sides?”  “Can you clasp them together like this?”  In 
their mind, if you like, what I’m hoping to hear is, “Yes, Anthony”, 
“Yes, Anthony”, “Yes, Anthony”, “Yes Anthony”, I want to get four 
or five hits.  Again, you can do this in a very authoritarian manner.  
“Stand here.  Put your feet together.  Do this.  Do that.”  That can 
work.  I’d like you have that skill to be that authoritarian, especially 
if you do stage work and I know that some of you do or are 
considering it.   
 
On the street, what I do looks very direct, but I’ve always got this 
soft edge.  The “would you, could you, can you, would you, may 
you”, it achieves exactly the same result, in step, arms out, hands 
clasped into this position. It’s very straightforward.  Get used to 
taking the rough edges off of it, but still very much being in control.  
Because you are in control, it means you don’t have to overbearing 
or authoritarian.  You’re the boss around here, you’re the guy that 
knows what he’s doing. So “Could you do this?  Would you do 
that?”  It’s very straightforward, they’ll just get right in step.   
 
Igor: 
Notice that there is no excess verbiage.  Not trying to explain 
yourself or explain why, or anything like that.  It’s literally how little 
you can do or say to get them to that point.  Make sense?  Everyone 
ready with this?  This is easy, right?    
 
Anthony: 
The aim this time is to get the person set to arms out, hands 
clasped.  There are dozens of things we can do from this point.  
We’re going to start moving into magnetic fingers and magnetic 
hands, but from this point, even when you’re setting this up, feet 
together, arms by your sides – “Would you put your hands out in 
front you?  Would you clasp them nice and tight?  Just bend your 
elbows.”  Again, make the little gag.  You’re not trying to be a 
comedian, but what I want to see, the reason why I made these 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
59 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
little jokes, if you know my stuff is that each part - fingers an inch 
apart, “If that’s an inch, your boyfriend’s been lying to you.”  “If 
you’re a fisherman, why don’t you make a desperate prayer.”  If 
you want to, it gets people to go ahh, and relax.  Other people start 
to see, “Oh, he is performing and he’s comfortable enough to make 
a joke.  
 
Igor: 
On that note, very important, only throw the joke out if it amuses 
you.  You’re not there to memorize a joke and go, “Okay, here’s my 
joke.”  No?  If it’s there, and it amuses you, say it in a respectful 
way.  Don’t put them down.  And if it’s not there, you don’t feel like 
it, just stick to the tried and tested routine, which is just the simple 
mechanics.  All right guys.  I think enough talking.  Off you go. 
 
 
Finger Vise 
 
Igor: 
See how much more natural it gets now.   You should be getting 
more focused on this and the early stuff should be kind of naturally 
tripping off your tongue by now.  That’s kind of why we do it this 
way, so when you get on the streets you won’t have to think very 
much, it’ll just kind of come out.  So what we’re going to do now is 
add the next piece to it.  Anthony, do you want to take them 
through it?  Just take them through from the compliance part. 
 
Anthony: 
Certainly.  Could you just take your feet together for me?  Stand 
nice and comfortably, your arms loose and relaxed.  I’m going to 
give you some instructions.  I want you to follow these instructions, 
okay? Can you place your hands out in front of you?  Can you clasp 
them together nice and tight so your palms are together and your 
thumbs are crossed on top?  Bend your elbows like you are making 
a desperate prayer.  You might want to make one right there, if you 
like.  Keep your palms together and put your first fingers up about 
an inch apart.  Look at the gap between your fingers because in a 
moment they will touch.  See they’re already starting to move.  
They’ll get closer and closer and closer.  When they touch, just close 
your eyes for me.  Keep your eyes closed and take a nice, slow, 
deep breath in and just breathe out for a longer period of time.  I’m 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
60 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
going to say the words, “One, two, wide awake, your eyes will open 
and you’ll be ready for your next instruction.”  Nod your head when 
you understand.  Once you’re wide-awake – that’s brilliant.  Shows 
me you can concentrate.   
 
Igor: 
Wow.  That’s cool.  Is that easy?  Don’t worry too much about the 
language, you’re just trying to get the idea across, right? The idea’s 
very straight forward.  We’ll show you ways of cheating with this 
and all kinds of stuff to load it in your favor, but don’t concern 
yourself right now.  The key things now are the hands are here. The 
palms are touching.  Hands – whoop, makes a nice little noise there 
– hands are touching.  Fingers are spread apart.  You look between 
them and whatever way you suggest, hand closing, magnets pulling 
them together.  Whatever language comes to mind, just describe it. 
 
Anthony: 
We will get into the details of the language, but let me just give you 
a few tips.  I’ll keep talking about these opportunities to kind of 
touch the person and get into their personal space.  “Will you put 
your hands out in front of you for me?  That’s right.  Straight out in 
front of you like that.”  There’s one.  Right there.  I’ve touched him.  
“Can you clasp your hands together nice and tight?  Bend your 
elbows.  That’s right, keeping them together.”  There’s another one.  
I’ve touched him again.  “Put your fingers up about an inch apart.”  
At this point, with some people, you’re going to have two seconds 
before their fingers touch.  I know that we haven’t gone over the 
language yet.  All I’m going to say is, “Look at the gap between your 
fingers.”  The very next utterance should be, “In a moment, your 
fingers will touch just like they’re two magnets.”  If they get there 
before you do, you are going to lose the small amount of credibility 
you might gain from this exercise.  “Look at the gap between your 
fingers.   
 
In a moment, they will come together and touch.  They are already 
starting to go.”  You are in the business of selling ideas, of putting 
ideas in his head.  The only idea I want in his head is that his fingers 
are magnets and they’re going to come together and touch.  I’m 
going to say, “Your fingers are magnets.  They will come together 
and touch.  They’ve already started to go.  The closer they get the 
stronger it becomes.  Just like two powerful magnets, they’re 
getting closer and closer.”  I could go on all day, to be honest.  I’m

61 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
essentially saying the same thing.  “They are magnets.  They’re 
going to touch.”  Bang.  Bang.  Into this point.  Not, “Oh, isn’t that 
interesting, I did this at school once.” No.  “Look at the gap between 
your fingers.  In a moment, they will touch.”  Just make it happen.  
You might be at one minute into your performance now.   
 
Igor: 
All right guys, let’s just make it a very quick exercise to show you 
how easy this is.  Everyone make sure you can see me.  Hands out 
like this please.  Rubs your hands.  Palms together.  Bring them 
aside about a foot apart.  Now feel the sensations on your palms.  
Can you feel that sensation tingly?  Now, those hands will close.  
Just tell your hands to close and they will close, coming together.  
Closing.  Closing.  Closing.  Feel that sensation in your hands.  Hands 
closing.  Closing.  Closing.  Closing.  Don’t try and help me.  Don’t try 
and resist.  Closing.  Closing.  Closing.  Don’t try and help me, don’t 
try and resist. Closing. Closing. Closing. Until they touch all the way, 
in which case, just close your eyes and take a breath and enjoy it, 
and then bring yourselves back.  Now, half of you just by saying the 
word closing, those hands came together.  Was that some crazy 
hypnotic suggestion?  It doesn’t take a lot.  All it requires is 
repetition with a little bit of emphasis.  If you think about just what 
to say, just say ‘closing’ a lot.  Did everyone hear experience at least 
something happening in their hands?  Not necessarily coming 
together all the way, everyone?   
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, even the tempo was pretty consistent there.  Sometimes 
people do, they’ll say I speak quite quickly.  I can tell you about 
ninety percent of the words coming out of my mouth are the same 
as in the last session I did.  When something is happening, all I’d 
suggest is that you just kind of build the tempo a little.  You don’t 
need to, but it’s starting to go.  It’s starting to happen.  I’m trying to 
get some excitement, some emotion, and some “Oh look at this! 
You’re right!”  Bear that in mind.  Be excited. 
 
Igor: 
Is that easy for you guys?  Again, we don’t care about any amazing 
language patterns.  The only idea is that you are trying to get the 
idea inside their mind that these two fingers will touch.  That’s it.   
 
Audience Member: What if nothing happens? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Igor: 
We’ll come back to that later.  That’s a good idea.  The question 
here is, “What if nothing happens?”  We’ll show you exactly how to 
deal with that in a moment’s time.  For the moment, just go with 
this, something will happen here.  I’ll show you why after this.  For 
the moment, just dive in and find out, right?  All right guys, off you 
go. 
 
 
You getting it all to pull together now?  Was this easier than you 
thought it would be?  No?  Maybe? I don’t know. Remember, just 
keep it simple and it will be simple.  Now what we want to do now 
is start giving you outs.  What if it doesn’t quite work out the way 
you’d like it to work out?  Help put your mind at ease in terms of 
you know how to handle pretty much anything that can come up, 
right?  The first out – we’re going to do another couple of these 
rounds, the whole thing from start to finish.  The first thing I want 
to have is, “Hey, it looks like you guys are having fun.”  And they say 
something like, “Not interested.  Leave me alone.”  It might happen.  
It’s not a big deal if it does.   
 
I mean, think about it.  Is it going to end your life if it happens?  In 
the bigger scheme of things, will your family burn in hell because 
there is someone who’s not interested?  Will your house be sold 
and will your children be sold into slavery and prostitution because 
this one person won’t talk to you?  I think that in the bigger scheme 
of things it’s fair to say that it’s not really that big of a deal.  It is a 
bigger deal though, if you make it a big deal.   
 
One of the best, shall I say, hints that I ever got about how to deal 
with this sort of thing was from an improvisational comedy genius, 
Keith Johnson was his name.  He basically said this, “When you’re 
on stage and you make a mistake, your audience has invested 
themselves in you emotionally.  If you feel bad, your audience will 
feel bad and they’ll hate you for it, for making them feel bad 
because you’re feeling awkward.  If you just take it in stride and you 
show them that they can take things like that in their stride too, 
they’ll love you for it.  You can make the most horrendous mistake 
and be totally embarrassed and go, “Sorry.”  They’ll love you for the 
fact that you weren’t affected by it.

A great example of this is when I was probably about seven years 
old.  We were doing one of these musical concerts in school.  You 
know the kind that kids always do and one of my friends, Marcus – I 
remember him.  He’s this great guy – he’s starting to play the 
clarinet and you know the clarinet is kind of difficult to get all the 
reeds and stuff going, he’s goes up and goes, [sound].  It is a 
horrible noise!  He just stands there and says one word, “Wrong!” 
and walks off. He got the best applause out of everyone that day.  
I’d like you to be a little bit like Marcus, just go “Wrong!”, okay.  So 
the secret to this is if something goes wrong, just smile and be 
grateful to them.  Like when I approached these guys and I said, “Hi 
Guys.  It looks like you are having some fun.  I’m a hypnotist.  I’m 
performing here.”  Already you are giving me way more leeway 
than I am expecting now and that’s fine. “I’m performing here.  I’d 
like to show you something about the power of the mind.  Do you 
guys want to have some fun and discover little bit about the power 
of the mind?”   
 
Audience Member: No.  Not really. 
 
Igor: 
“That’s fine.  Thank you so much for time, folks.  Have a great day.”  
How much better can I feel walking away like that than if I say 
again, “You guys want to learn about the power of the mind?” 
 
Audience Member: No. 
 
Igor: 
“Oh, I’m sorry.” (hangs his head and walks away)  Um.  Same 
situation.  Same scenario.  Which one can you walk away with your 
head held high?  Which one have I walked away with my self-
esteem and my status all intact?  It’s the one where I’m being 
gracious.   
 
Anthony: 
If you get rejection at that point, you might want to look at your 
approach.  You might want to look at your body language.   
Personally, I would persist at least once.  I’d at least have one other 
stab at it.  If they are just said no, they’re not interested because 
they’re expecting to be sold.  They expect it’s a questionnaire or 
something else.  I’ll say it again, “I’m a performer.  I want to show 
you something interesting.”  “No, I’m not really interested.”  I’ll say, 
“ Thanks for your time, Guys.  Cheers.  Have a great evening.”   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
64 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
I’m still on top here.  I’m still absolutely comfortable with my game.   
 
Igor: 
He’s the one handing out compliments.  I’m allowing you to have a 
good evening.  The fact that you’re not going to play with me, 
unlucky for you.  I’m not only saying that, it’s also my attitude.  It’s 
no big deal.  Have a great day.  It’s cool.  There are plenty of people 
to play with.  
 
Anthony: 
I tend to have another punt at that point, but if you need to walk 
away, you need to walk away, just do it strong.   
 
Igor: 
Do it with grace.  Let’s get back into those groups for a take one 
round.  We’re going to have a go.  The first time you do this, I want 
the people to reject you and you just go, “Thank you and have a 
great day.”  Be really complimentary like they have done you a 
great favor, which in some ways they have.   
 
Then after that, you can throw it in at random.  Then you can 
decide if you want to persist a little bit, if you want to say thank you 
and move away, whatever you want to do with it, but in between, 
there’ll be successes as well.  If you want to mirror the streets a 
little bit, some successes, some less interested, some people you 
can crack through, if you just persist a little more.  Does that make 
sense to you guys?  Make sure that the first time that you do it, 
though, that you give them failure, so they get a chance to realize 
that it’s not really a failure, it’s just life.  Easy?  Off you go. 
 
Audience Member: Quick question 
 
Igor: 
Quick question. 
 
Audience Member: After we fail, then we’re going to do it again and go all the way 
through? 
 
Igor: 
You’ll do it again with someone else.  We’ll rotate you.  The first 
one will be failure both ways.  Then we’ll rotate you and it’ll just be 
the however you want to deal with this is fine.

Anthony: 
One other things I want to say at this point, now that we’ve started 
to embark on these exercises, however trivial you think this is, I can 
assure you it isn’t.  This is the lever that’s allowed me to open lots 
and lots of doors and lots and lots of minds.  When you are doing 
this now, even if you think this is a bit of a trick, understand your 
intention, your absolute intention is to make that happen.  You are 
going to make this happen with suggestion.  It’s not a body trick.  
You are going to make their fingers come together with suggestion.   
 
My intention when I do this, even if I don’t do it as an induction is 
to hypnotize the person.  I want them done, over, finished by the 
end of the exercise.  No, not everyone is going to be at that point, 
but that is my aim.  If I’m in a classroom, I’m exactly the same.  I’m 
not going through the motions, spitting the words out.  Make it 
your intention to make this happen.  Your expectation is that that is 
going to happen.  Your intention, your expectation, what you want, 
is that you’re going to get into this person’s head, at this early 
stage.  Just start to get the mindset, you are responsible for this. 
 
Igor: 
Just to demonstrate this, so you can see what he is talking about in 
action.  You tell me when I have the right intention and when I 
don’t.  Put your hands like this.  Will skip all the rest.  Hands out like 
that.  Those hands, those fingers will start touching.  Slowly they’ll 
come together like magnets, closing, closing, closing, closing all the 
way.  When they close, close your eyes and take a deep breath and 
go all the way inside.  That’s right all the way inside.  Did I have 
intention or not?  Let’s try that again.   
 
Open your hands.  Hands together like this.  Fingers up.  Those 
fingers are going to come together.  They are going to close.  Close.  
Close.  Closing.  Closing.  Please.  Oh, I’m going to go.  Where was 
my intent?  Did you hear the difference?  Did you see the 
difference?  I mean, I’m hamming it up a little bit, but this is where 
– I had a great quote from someone once, which is “Hypnosis is a 
confidence game.”  No confidence, no game, right?  So just play 
with it.  Have fun with it.  It will happen, especially the rule is, the 
larger the group, the easier your life will be. 
 
Anthony: 
Be intrigued.  Be fascinated, like the magician who is conjuring up a 
twenty-minute story and actually culminates in a puff of smoke, or 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
66 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
something moving.  The point is, to make that play big, you’ve got 
to be on it.  What do you expect?  It’s going t happen.  It’s not going 
to happen.  It’s the same with the fingers.  They are starting to go 
like magnets, closer and closer and closer.  It’s just another 
suggestion, but I’ve done this five thousand times with different 
people.  I’m not bored of doing it.  I’m still, “Look at it!  They’re 
starting to move!  They are starting to go.  They are getting closer 
and closer.” Keep your energy levels high.  Keep your intrigue and 
excitement at a higher level.  
 
Igor: 
All right Guys, is that easy to do?  Remember the first round, you’ll 
have a failure then the other person will have a failure.  You’ll 
rotate.  Then that point failures might come in at random places.  
You’ll just deal with it with a big gracious smile.  Thank you very 
much.  Off you go.  Then, when it comes to these things, just 
absolutely get fascinated, go first.  Enjoy the fact that the hypnosis 
is going on right in front of you and you get to lap up some of that 
hypno - magnet from them and maybe put your own version there 
too. 
 
 
Master Secrets for Demos 
 
Anthony: 
If anyone says to me, “Yeah, but what’s next?  I’m squeezing my 
hands.”  I’ll say, “Hey, you’re pretty sharp.  Put your hands out in 
front of you.  Is there any reason that your hands should come 
together?”  “No.”  “Look at the gap between them.  Close your 
eyes” and just get into it.  You’ve got to work a tiny bit harder.  It’s 
still pointless as a test because ninety nine percent of people are 
going to achieve this.  It’s not going to tell you a great deal, if they 
can’t get it, fair enough, you just move on.   
 
But the vast majority of people are going to pass this.  Your job is to 
get them hooked into this.  Get them listening.  Get them taking 
instructions.  Get them complying.  Also, to start observing.  You’ll 
see me when you’re practicing, I am listening to you, but I am also 
walking around like this, looking at your eyelids, looking at your 
face, looking at your breathing because I want to be able to pick 
people off.  When I’m working with a group, you watch some of my 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
67 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
videos, you’ll see me leaning in looking very closely.  I’m looking for 
those tiny giveaways.  The little ace up my sleeve that I can use 
later on.   
 
Igor: 
Don’t worry, Guys.  You’ll get there.  You’ll see exactly the same 
things.  Experience will really teach you these things.  For a 
moment, we want to keep it very simple.  We going to do finger 
magnets, followed by a hand magnets.   
 
Anthony: 
Then we’ll talk about how to turn this into a hand lock or a finger 
lock.  
 
Igor: 
All that will come up. 
 
Anthony: 
Which is a stronger test, but at this point you have to make this 
happen.  You’ve picked up the ball and you’re not going to put it 
down until the hands touch.  Keep talking.  Don’t lose your 
momentum.  Don’t lose your intent.  Don’t say please.  Tell them 
how it is.  Tell them what’s happening.  Lie if you have to.  Let’s just 
get it into their mind.  I mean that.  They are really starting to go – 
 
Igor: 
Just one quick question before we begin. 
 
Audience Member: All I have wondered today is when you are asking him to bring his 
hands together, do you tell him what’s going to happen before his 
hands come together? 
 
Anthony: 
Personally – you don’t need to.  My preference – I nearly always 
stack it magnetic fingers, magnetic hands.  The first one is eyes 
open and when they’re millimeters away, I’ll say, “When your 
fingers touch, allow your eyes to close.”  It’s still permissive.  “Open 
your eyes.  Excellent.”  That shows me you can concentrate.  “Now 
I’m going to ask you to use your imagination to concentrate in the 
same way.  But to use your imagination, I will ask you to close your 
eyes.”  I give him an excuse to close their eyes, a justification, if you 
like for why I’m going to do that.  I then just demonstrate.  There is 
no need.  They will get it anyway, but you’ll success rate will be 
higher if it’s crystal clear.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
68 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
What is also does is it gets them over the fear of standing there 
with their eyes closed now because this is quite a big commitment 
from somebody.  So I’ll say, “Look, I’ll show you what we are going 
to do and then we’re going to do and then we’re going to do it.  I’ll 
ask you to put your hands out like this”, and then I’ll do it.  Again, 
I’m always trying to suggest that they do it, but I’ll just demonstrate 
it first.  “Put your hands out, you’ll have your eyes closed.  I know 
you’re keen, but just watch first.  Just look at the gap between your 
hands.  You got a magnet here and here.  They’ll be pulled together 
just like magnets.  It’s a bit of an odd feeling because you won’t be 
able to tell where they are, but they’ll touch.  When they do, just let 
your hands drift down.  Just relax as you did before.” 
 
Igor:  
He just demonstrated exactly what’s going to happen. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s a good way when it is starting with this stuff – I know these 
exercises are easy to do, but it’s a very good way of rehearsing your 
patter and your lines.  A lot of my inductions work like that where I 
essentially show them what they’re going to do.  Then we’re going 
to do it.  I’ll take your wrist.  I’ll lift it here.  Your eyes will close.  You 
going to hypnosis.  I’ll push it down.  You’ll be back in the room.  
You ready?  I’ll take hold of your wrists and I lift up to here.  I’ve 
already said it.  It’s a great option and it’s just meant to be 
rehearsed.   
 
Igor: 
I’ll tell you, folks, don’t concern yourself too much about the 
minutia.  We are talking about really polishing a mechanism here.  
Right now, honestly, just do the hands there.  Fingers touching.  You 
did fantastic.  Now put your hands out like this, two magnets, 
closing, closing.  If you want to say closing, closing, that is fine.  The 
point is just get out there and just start doing it.  We’ll start refining 
as we go along. 
 
Anthony: 
And again, the same tip between here and here, you’re not here to 
have a conversation about how fascinating it is.  You’re here to give 
them a compliment.  You’re here to ask them how good they feel.  
How strange was that?  How interesting was that?  That kind of 
thing the only response is, “Yeah, quite interesting.  Yeah, quite 
good.  Yeah, quite relaxing.”  It sounds like an open question, but 
it’s not.  You don’t want to have a conversation about it.  You just 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
69 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
want to say, “Right, next.  Let’s do something else.”  This time using  
your imagination.  I will ask you to close your eyes for this one.  Let 
me show and do it.  In the absence, of anything else to say, you’re 
doing brilliantly.  You’re doing wonderfully, and mean it.   
 
If you’re like – (said in an non-meaningful way) “You’re doing 
wonderfully”, trust me, it’s going to fall apart.  Give them 
encouragement.  Say what you can see.  We’ve haven’t come on to 
the wonderful words, “That’s right,” yet.  You’re going to hear me 
saying that an awful lot.  Not because I am trying to be Erickson, but 
because I’m trying to let the person know that you are doing fine.  
You’re doing exactly what I want you to do.  Martin, can you just 
stand on that tile there for me and just face this way? In fact we’ll 
just stand around here, if that’s all right with you. Have we met 
before today?  When?  We met today, but we’ve never met before? 
(No)  We don’t know each other? (No) I haven’t hypnotized you 
before? (No) We have not set anything up? (No) Can you just place 
your feet together for me, are you happy to be hypnotized? Thank 
you.  Just have your hands nice and loose.  You don’t have to close 
your eyes yet.  Just open your eyes.  I’m going to take you through a 
couple of simple exercises really just to fire up your imagination and 
get you to concentrate.  You happy to with that? (Yes)   
 
 
We’re going to start like this.  Can you just place your hands out in 
front of you?  Can you clasp your hands tight?  Palms together.  
Thumbs crossed.  A nice tight unit.  Bend your elbows like you’re 
making a sort of desperate prayer.  You may want to make one 
while you are there, if you like.  Put your first fingers up about an 
inch apart.  Look at the gap between them because in a moment, 
they will touch like they are magnets being pulled together, 
powerful magnets begin pulled together.  When they touch, just 
close your eyes.   
 
With your eyes closed, you will not fall over.  This is not hypnosis.  
Just take a nice slow deep breath in and just breathe out and let go 
of any tension.  Let go of any doubt.  Let go of any inhibitions.   As 
your hands drift down, I want you to just open your eyes now.  
Excellent.  You can pull your hands apart.  Just shows me that you 
can concentrate, okay?  Now, I’m going to show you exactly the 
same thing.  I’m feeling pretty good about Martin as a subject.  I’m 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
70 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
going to show you exactly the same exercise now and I’ll show you 
another direction you can take it.  I’m going to show you how to use 
your imagination.  If I ask you to concentrate, concentrate.  If I ask 
you to get a feeling for something, I really want you to do your best 
to do that, okay? (Yes)   
 
Can you place your hands out in front of you?  Can you clasp your 
hands together like this, nice and tight?  Palms together.  Thumbs 
crossed.  Bend your elbows.  Just put your first fingers up about an 
inch apart.  Don’t close your eyes yet.  Look at the gap between 
your fingers because in a moment, they are going to touch.  This is 
going to make you feel good.  When they touch, just allow your 
eyes to close.  That’s right.  When you have your eyes close, I want 
you to think of the person who is dearest to you on this planet.  You 
don’t need to tell me who it is, but when you’ve got someone in 
mind, someone you love, someone you care for just nod your head 
so that I understand.   
 
Now, I want you to see their face.  I want you to see their eyes.  See 
them smiling.  Hear their voice.  Hear their laughter.  Be there in 
your body if you are not there already.  In a memory involving 
them.  Feel what you feel for that person.  As you feel that love and 
you listen to my voice, you’re fingers are becoming stuck, bolted 
together, glued together, absolutely stuck together.  When you 
realize they’re stuck, I want you to raise your hands up a little 
higher, so I can see them.  Again, feeling what you feel for that 
person as you listen to my voice, your fingers are becoming 
absolutely stuck and bolted together, glued together.  You can try 
and pull them apart, but find that they’re stuck fast now.   
 
You’re a strong guy.  Put some effort in it, try and pull them apart 
and find they’re stuck.  When you realized that they are glued, even 
your hands now, super glued together, raise them up towards the 
ceiling, so that I understand.  That’s right.  You’re doing 
wonderfully.  You will not fall over.  Now I’m going to touch your 
hands and your hands will just drift down.  That’s right, they will 
just drift down slowly, and you can drift down with them and relax.  
That’s right.  Just open your eyes.  Once you are wide-awake, you 
can pull your hands apart now.  Excellent.  That shows me you have 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
71 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
a brilliant sense of concentration.   I’m way down the road now.  I’m 
absolutely ready to go with Martin at this point.  Have I said sleep?   
 
Have I said that there is an induction?  Is he hypnotized yet?  In fact, 
no, all I have really said is, “This isn’t hypnosis,” which is as good as 
saying, this is hypnosis.  So we’re going to do something very 
similar, can you put your hands out in front of you?  Right.  Just a 
few tips.  Some of you are doing this, I noticed, Sherack, when you 
were working with Nathan, Nathan’s hands were out like this.  
That’s going to make your job harder.  That means you’ve missed an 
opportunity to correct his physical posture.  The second thing you 
put your hands out.  Some of you are doing it like this, “You’ll get 
there.”  You’re going to have to work a lot harder.  You want them 
about six inches apart.  You want an opportunity to do this, even 
less.   
 
The final thing I’ll do when I say, you’ve got a magnet here and 
here, this is just before getting to close their eyes, is I just put a bit 
of pressure on his hands.  Not so suggestible that he won’t resist, 
but basically I say, “You’ve got a magnet here and here pulling your 
hands together.”  Now at this point, I’m pushing on his hands.  Not 
really hard, but there is pressure on his hands.  When I say, just 
close your eyes for me.  I am going to cheat.  I am going to cheat 
every single step of the way that I can.  Put your hands out in front 
of you.  I want you to imagine there is a magnet here and here 
pulling your hands together.   
 
Now close your eyes for me.  With your eyes close, those magnets 
will pull them together.  When then touch, take a nice deep breath 
in and just breathe out and relax, that’s right. And sleep now, just 
go deeper, deeper, deeper down.  You will not fall over.  You’re legs 
will support you.  Deeper and deeper to sleep now.  Sinking, 
floating, drifting down to sleep.  In a moment, I’ll touch the back of 
your left hand and it’s going to start being pulled up towards your 
face just like a magnet is pulling it up.  Your head’s a magnet and 
this hand is a magnet.  The closer it gets the funnier that is going to 
seem to some unknown reason it is going to put a smile on your 
face.  You might even begin to chuckle.

That chuckle is going to turn into a laugh.  That’s right.  As you begin 
to stand up with your hands stuck to your head now, this is going to 
seem hilarious.  In fact, Martin, you are going to start to laugh as 
inappropriately as you possibly can for no apparent reason at all.  
Every time that I click my fingers, it will get funnier and funnier and 
funnier and funnier.  That’s right, that chuckle, that giggle is going 
to turn into a laugh.  This is going to get funnier and funnier and 
funnier, every time I click my fingers.  Now it is like the funniest 
scene from the funniest film only you’re there and this time you can 
laugh with complete abandon.  You feel amazing.  You’re going to 
feel this rush of good chemicals, whizzing through your brain, 
whizzing your body.   
 
The next time I click my fingers for some unknown reason, you start 
to laugh like a posh old lady.  You’re going to start to titter away.  
You love this film.  It’s your favorite old film.  I touch you again and 
you laugh like a little baby now.  You don’t know why, but you’re 
going to giggle like a baby.  You don’t know why, but it is going to 
get funnier and funnier every passing second.  I click again and you 
laugh like an evil demon.  Now, you are an evil demon.  I click them 
again and you’ll laugh like a pig.  You won’t know why, but you 
snort.  You can’t help it.  Two pigs laughing together.  I’ll click them 
and you’ll squeal again like a pig dying of swine flu.  That’s right.  
You won’t know why.   
 
Even that is going to feel amazing.  Now from this moment forward, 
Martin, when I say the words sleep, with the intention to hypnotize 
you, you will immediately return to this state.  When I say that 
word with the intention to hypnotize you, you immediately return 
to this state if it’s safe and appropriate for you to do so.  Nod your 
head when that’s understood.  When I say one, two, wide awake, 
your eyes will open and you’ll be back in the room acting perfectly 
on the suggestion you’ve been given with no real idea why you are 
doing that, it will seem perfectly natural to you.  Again, just nod 
your head when you understand.   
 
When I say sleep, you’ll return to this state.  When I say one, two, 
wide awake, your eyes will open and you’ll be able to move and 
speak normally acting perfectly on the suggestion that you’ve been 
given.  In a moment, I’m going to wake you up.  You can let this 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
73 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
hand drift down now.  In a moment, I’ll count to five.  On the count 
of five, you’ll be wide-awake, you’ll be back in the room.  You’ll be 
feeling fantastic, like you have woken up from eight-hour sleep, like 
you have had a three-hour massage and everything that you’ve 
learned will be there, gelling with the information you already have 
in your mind.  When we go out there on the streets, you’ll be 
absolutely confident, your words will flow, your actions will flow.  
You are the hypnotist; you absolutely know that to the very core of 
your being.   
 
When I count to five, your eyes will open, you’ll be back in the room 
feeling a rush of enjoyment and pleasure as you get a huge round of 
applause.  One, feel a surge of energy pouring in from those fingers 
and toes now.  Two, again feel that rush of energy filling you up.  
Three, take a deep breath, Martin.  Fill your chest now with energy 
giving oxygen.  Four, a cool breeze drifting your head, your eyes are 
clear, nose clear, throat clear, chest clear, stomach clear.  And Five.   
How’s that Martin?   
 
 
I won’t get side tracked to tell you more, but hopefully you can see 
if you’re feeling good about this, if you’re feeling a little bit gutsy 
about this, then magnetic fingers is as good a routine as any.  What 
did I do?  I did the same stuff that we’ve been doing to ourselves.  I 
got him involved in it.  I raised his level of emotion.  That could be 
the person who is dearest to you.  It could be something that you 
love to do.  Something that you’d love to achieve.  Hit all modes - 
see their face, see their smile, hear their laughter, hear their voice, 
feel what you feel for them.  Dissociate him.  Step into it with your 
body, if you’re not there.  Then, he’s hooked in.  As you feel that 
and as you listen to my voice, your fingers are becoming stuck and 
bolted together.   
 
If you never said that to anyone, you’ll think, “ridiculous.”  This is 
not going to happen.  You have to just get over it.  It’s like, I’m 
invisible.  It feels absurd when you first say it.  At some point, 
you’ve got to say it.  As you feel that, as you listen to me, your 
fingers are becoming stuck and bolted together.  Where I challenge 
that is when you realize they are stuck is when you say raise them 
up, so that I can see them.  I’m not saying, “Pull them apart. Do 
your best.  Pull them apart.”  When you realize that they are stuck, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
74 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
raise them up.  If you do that in a crowd, I guarantee, you’ll get 
seventy eight percent, which is massive compared to a hand lock or 
anything else.  People can commit to that.  You can just spot them.  
You can just say there they are.  So, thanks for doing that Martin.   
 
Igor: 
All right, Folks.  I hope that you enjoyed that.  Did you enjoy that?  
Was that a nice little demo?  Give a nice round of applause to 
Anthony for that. 
 
 
I just want to emphasize something very important.  We do not to 
expect you to do this yet.  But by the end of the day, it will be a no 
brainer.  It will be so easy.  We’ll be going faster and faster now that 
the foundation is there.   
 
The only thing that we really care about now as we go out for lunch 
break, and really, this is your chance to experiment and play with 
things is get the approach right and make sure you smile.  Make 
someone else feel comfortable.  Can you get them to do this simple 
test?  If you do nothing more than the fingers and say, “Thank you 
very much.  Wonderful mind you have.  It’s been a pleasure working 
with you,” and you leave, that’s fine. For a moment, that’s all we 
really want to see from you.  If you decide you want to play a little 
bit, go a little bit further, experiment with something, do 
something, by all means, do so.  Does that make sense to you?  It is 
highly up to you about how far you take it.  If you get a really good 
feeling half way through, and go, “hell, why not?  May as well.” 
Then just jump in and do that.

Anthony: 
How many people walked up to someone and had a go?  Vast 
majority; okay.  Your hands aren’t up. Why not?  You seem like a 
confident, friendly guy.  You look more like a hypnotist than I do. 
 
Igor: 
 I saw you.  
 
Anthony: 
Yes, you sir, the hypnotist with the goat tee.   
 
Igor: 
 I saw you. You had a go. 
 
Audience Member: The results weren’t… 
 
Igor: 
It doesn’t matter the results. Get out of the results. 
 
 
 
Anthony: 
The result is meaningless at this point. So you had a few goes.   
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Anthony: 
I know a few of you didn’t, and I understand where you’re at, and 
you probably spent half an hour out there feeling uncomfortable.  I 
spent quite a few years in exactly that place before I did this.  I 
moved to another country. I moved back again. I still haven’t 
actually walked up to somebody and done it.  You can spend the 
rest of your life there, but I don’t you want to.  It takes a deep 
breath.  It takes a mistake.  It takes a fumble.  It takes a slip up 
before you can correct it.  So I know it’s hard, and it’s not the most 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
76 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
natural place to be in. But take the opportunity this weekend. 
Practice on each other if you’re not quite ready for the public.   
 
But if you didn’t step up out there, I’m not just speaking to you, 
Andy, there are a few others.  But if you didn’t step up out there, do 
not dare write this off at this point because I know you can do this.  
It is way too soon.  What we wanted to get out of that, yes, it would 
be great if people would get some success. But what we want is you 
to feel the fear, but do it anyway to coin a phrase because you can’t 
maintain it.  You can’t maintain that level of fear and anxiety.  It’s 
just blood coursing through your veins, getting you ready to deliver. 
 
Igor: 
The other thing to bear in mind is, the reason we say that the 
results really aren’t relevant today is because you’re doing it the 
hardest way possible in terms of the venue you’re at, on the 
streets, people walking, being busy at lunchtime and so on.  In 
terms of the city you’re in, London is not the world’s most hug a 
stranger city.  And it’s not, right?  So you have that all stacked 
against you. The key thing is if you can do it here, you can do it 
anywhere. And you’ll see tonight, the chances of people actually 
speaking to you and being open to this whole thing, they will 
double if not triple as soon as the sun starts to set and peoples’ 
attitudes start to unwind, and they’re just having a chill out, having 
a beer with a friend or something like that.  
 
 
And they have all the time in the world, and they’re going yeah, 
sure.  I’ll give it a go. What do you have to do?  And really, it just 
goes from there. So the key thing is can you start working with this.  
Now, those of you who are so particularly like I don’t know if I can 
talk to strangers, it might be enough if in your groups and your little 
try outs, which by the way, you’re sticking to those groups for the 
rest of the weekend.  Once you’re out, here’s what’s likely to 
happen.  You’re chatting to your group; you’re doing all these 
things. Suddenly, you’ll have all these people doing this.  I’m not 
looking but… Right?   
 
Now, if you want to ignore them, that’s fine. That’s your 
prerogative. But really, what you want to be doing at that point is 
you’re basically stealing attention. Do you realize that? When 
you’re with your three people, and they’ve all got their hands 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
77 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
coming up together and people are doing this, just smile.  “Come 
over here, just watch.”  Is there any pressure on them when they’re 
watching?  No.  Now, once you’ve done one round with your 
friends, and you say, “Let’s do another one.  Hey, why don’t you 
join in?” “Sure, that looked like fun.”  Do you see how now you’ve 
involved them in the process?  It’s really low pressure on you.  It’s 
really low pressure on them. And you’re still doing it out in the real 
world and so on. Does that kind of make sense to you guys?  It’s a 
kind of indirect way of getting people involved if you don’t quite 
want to go up and jump and talk to people.  
 
 
Although honestly, once you get used to talking to random 
strangers with a purpose, it’s not only easy, it’s actually quite 
exhilarating.  I mean, those of you who did it and actually went all 
the way through, burst through that initial seal, wasn’t it kind of 
exhilarating?  Didn’t you have fun?  
 
Audience Member: Hm, hum. Yeah. 
 
Igor:  
Wasn’t it kind of addictive where you thought – this guy here was a 
machine.  Every time I turned my back, he’s back in another group, 
another group. But then four or five people who just blanked you 
out until you got the process, until you got the momentum built up. 
And that’s how it will happen. 
 
Anthony: 
And again, I think certainly in the group where we were in the 
square there, those of you who approached, the vast majority of 
the people were up for it. They were up for something.  It may not 
have gone anywhere.  They may not have been very hypnotically 
talented. But ultimately, you did it.  You engaged.  You got into the 
exercises, and that is my experience. When I take groups out into 
the street, I expect a good 78 percent of people to say okay, let’s try 
something. From that group, we’ve got to find the people who are 
going to be excellent at it. But a few of you got two or three 
rejections in a row.  I know it’s hard to not be demoralized and to 
think is it me? What should I have a suit on or all these different 
things.   
 
But there was at least one case in my group of every possible 
situation.  I’m sorry; I can’t remember your name?

Audience Member:  James. 
 
Anthony: 
James took himself off on his own, walked out of the main square.  
It’s almost like a side street. There’s James, there’s one woman, got 
into it. She was nervous. She was scared about it.  Managed to talk 
her into the exercises and was wow, that’s amazing and was 
interested.  He got a date. Someone else got offered money.  You 
haven’t actually done anything yet.  But you’ve also done so much. 
This is what the strangers want.  They are having their normal, 
boring Friday lunchtime, Friday evening.  It’s the same every time.   
 
 
They go out, they get drunk, they go home. You’re about to make 
that day more interesting. 
 
Igor: 
How many hypnotherapies are in the room?  The therapists put 
your hands up.  This is a great way to get clients. At least one of the 
guys in my group who was it that got offered – was it you who got 
the details?  So he’s just doing a quick demo to someone who says, 
“Damn, I want to stop smoking. Have you got a card or take my 
card.”  He’s got a client. He just got paid the equivalent of $200.00 
or $300.00, whatever his rates will be, for having some fun at 
lunchtime. Think about it.  Because you pick up clients like that.  
 
So those of you who want to do hypnotherapy, honestly, either 
through Stage Hypnosis where you do kind of a little show at Rotary 
Clubs and so on or if it’s street hypnosis where you just walk around 
your local community and demonstrate the power of hypnosis, 
people go. “Yes. You’re the one I want to stop smoking with.”  
“You’re the one that’s going to help me lose weight.” or overcome 
that fear of flying or whatever because they’ve had an experience 
with you now.  You’re not some random name in the phone book. 
You’re a real person with real skills. Does that make sense to you 
guys?   
 
So this is a tremendous skill set, and really, I’m going to encourage 
you guys to play with it. Tonight, you’ll see when we go out, we’ll 
still be out more in the streets because there’s big groups of you, 
and we can’t take you all into a bar or a nightclub because it gets 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
79 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
very awkward navigating through that. But once you filter off in 
your own little groups, two and three at a time, you’ll notice it’s 
actually a lot easier.   
 
 
You sit down with a group of people there that are having a few 
beers, you smile, they smile back. You go, “Hey guys, guess what I 
do?” “What?” “Hypnosis.” “ No.” “ Yes.”  “No.”   
 
Anthony: 
I can do something stupid.  You’re going to get all the classic 
requests. 
 
Igor: 
You’ll get all those. And say you know what I’m not going to make 
you stupid, why don’t you come here. Who’s going to volunteer? 
I’m going to show you how to do it with them.  Come and stand up 
guys because now you’re recruiting people to be on your side.  
You’ll start playing with these dynamics a little bit more, these 
social dynamics between different groups of people and so on.  It 
starts to come more naturally. The key thing is No. 1, do you have 
this friendly vibe, this friendly atmosphere that people go wow, I 
trust this guy.  This is a good guy.  Or go No. 2, can you involve 
people?  If they’re like get involved, and say its okay, relax.  I’m not 
going to ask you anything I wouldn’t ask my own mother to do.   
 
 
I don’t like my mother very much, but hey.  But you see what 
happens?  They laugh, and the tension goes away again. Forget the 
hypnosis thing. Let’s just do a concentration exercise just to see if 
your minds actually will take this. 
 
Anthony: 
Forget the hypnosis.   
 
Igor: 
Just get them involved.  You’re just getting them playing with the 
stuff and so on. Does that kind of make sense to you guys?  Now, 
there’s nothing new compared to what we’ve talked about.  We’ve 
talked about all these ideas already this morning. Does it now make 
more sense now that you’ve actually had real interaction with real 
people?  Would that be fair?  So take the time over the course of 
the rest of the day now to really engrain this H+.  There’s less 
pressure here, so you get your whole rubbing, your whole hands 
together, okay, this is good.  Remember, I mean, how many of you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
80 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
guys kind of broke all the rules and went, “How are you guys doing? 
OH, God!”   
 
Anthony: 
“Oh. Shit. 
 
 
Igor: 
“Hi.” (Wait, wait, wait) “Alright, bye.”  “Oh, no, but I’m a hypnotist 
and…”  Right? The timing is critical there.  
 
 
“Hey guys, you look like you’re a fun bunch of people.  I’m a 
hypnotist.  I’m performing here tonight. And I want to show people 
something really cool about the powers of their minds.  I want to 
show them how easy it is to access things that they didn’t even 
know was possible. Did you know it was easy to find things out in 
your mind that you didn’t know was there?  Let’s find out. Everyone 
just put your hands up like this for a moment.  Just stand up all of 
you.”   
 
Just stop right there.  Did you see how simple that was?  Do you see 
how easy that is? And if people look a little hesitant you need to 
say, “Look, stand over here with me and watch these guys do 
something.”  
 
 
They’ll love this.  Just see the look on their faces. And then 
sometimes they’ll go I wish I’d taken part as well now because it 
looks like they’re having fun. So here’s enough of talking unless 
there’s anything else you want to add there. 
 
Anthony: 
No.  Just that we’re not spending half a day on walking up and 
approach for no reason.  If, in the absence of anything else, if you 
are one of the people saying oh, what do I say?  I’m a bit stuck.  
Stick to the structure.  Give them a compliment.  Introduce yourself.  
Ask a question.  Get started.  You’re not there to have 
conversations at this point.  You’re not there to take numbers and 
get dates.

Glued Hands Demo 
 
Igor: 
So come here please.  Come on up. Just put your hands out like this 
for a moment.  You know where I’m going with this, right? Put your 
hands together like that.  Put your feet together as well, please.  
Interlock your fingers. Bring them up.  And then just show that little 
space between your fingers.  
 
Those fingers will start touching very soon.  You’ll feel them coming 
together, and when they touch, that’s right.  Look at them touching 
all the way and sleep, close your eyes all the way.  That’s right. 
Standing on your own balance, now, on your own balance going 
deeper and deeper.  That’s right, going deeper and deeper.  You 
even feel fantastic just standing there right now.  And those hands 
can just relax. That’s right. Take this hand. I’m not going to ask you 
to stick it here anymore quickly, than you can find something really 
charming inside your life, something that makes you feel good. 
Something you’re so attached to that the hand simply will not want 
to move.  Get it stuck there because the more it sticks to this, the 
more good you can feel inside. Feel that feeling now.  Can you feel 
it happening?  Your eyes, your smile beginning to develop, and that 
hand sticky tightly to this place. So tightly that tighter you stick, the 
more that feeling becomes strong inside.  You can feel that 
happening, can’t you? That’s right. And only when you’re sure that 
this is nicely stuck in here and that feeling is so strong that this hand 
will not move, then test it. That’s it.  And relax.   
 
 
And just enjoy that feeling. What I want you to know is that every 
time you bring that hand to this place and concentrate in this way, 
you’ll feel this good. That’s good to know, isn’t it?  And I’ll count 
one, two, three. At a count of three, just open your eyes feeling 
fantastic.  One, two, three.  Hand release, and good job. Well done.  
Fantastic.  You didn’t expect that to happen, did you?   
 
Now, that’s a very simple little demo, isn’t it?  It’s very – I mean, it’s 
really nothing more than you’ve done already.  What I want you 
guys to realize is it’s really where you’ve been going all day anyway.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
82 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
And you’ve been focusing on the approach. But really, the rest of it 
becomes relative and mechanical.  
 
 
To do it is very simple.  You’re going to go up to – the whole point – 
fingers pointing here.  Do the second one as well.  Remember let’s 
just do one just because it will be a little bit quicker. Right? Then 
when you get to the one -- do you mind if I borrow you just for the 
physical parts of it? 
 
Anthony: 
OK. 
 
Igor: 
If you just stand up a second. So he’s gone here, he’s got his fingers 
all ready and stuff like that, they are touching at this point.  So he’s 
looking at this point.  All you’re going to do is very gently is move 
his hands down, move him forward a little bit on the shoulder just 
to give him a little jolt.  You’re not going to shake him like a shaken 
baby syndrome thing.  Just a little jolt forward and say the word 
sleep. Can you all do that? Can you all move one hand toward you?  
Let’s try that.  Sleep.  Can we all try that in midair?  
 
Is that easy?  Let’s try that again because I didn’t see everyone 
move. Sleep. That’s easy, isn’t it?  So the hands up here and what 
you’re doing is sleep.  Now, be prepared.  Some people like Robyn 
over here will really start lurching all over.  So be prepared to catch 
them.  Grab their shoulder and say bounce on your own feet. Then 
just say something nice.  I want you to feel really good.  Relax this 
hand down and feel really good.  And when you do feel really good, 
just let me know with a smile or nod of your head.  That’s pretty 
good, isn’t it?  Now, at this point, really you’re done. You’ve done 
an introduction.  And the deeper you go, the better you feel and 
that language.  And every time you feel this touch, you’ll go deeper, 
and it will feel even better.   
 
 
Then if you want to test it, just take one of their hands and stick it 
over here so they have that feeling inside.  The stronger this hand 
feels that sensation of your chest, the better you’ll feel.  That hand 
is linked to that feeling.  Get attached to the hand like you’re 
attached to that feeling.  
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
83 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
So I’m using the fundamental law of the mind here.  It’s the law of 
associations.  He’s now feeling the hands stuck to his chest, and he 
calls it good feelings.  Now, will he want that hand to be removed 
from his chest?  I’m giving him the payoff for keeping it there, 
aren’t I?  Because that’s one of the ways you can cheat a little bit in 
order to create the framework to make it work for him.  You don’t 
need it. You don’t have to do it. It works actually just as fine 
without it.  It was just pure suggestion. We’re just loading it in our 
favor a little bit.  Make sense?   
 
“So only when you’re sure this hand is stuck nice and tight, and you 
can feel this good, go ahead and test it and know that you can feel 
that good whenever you want to.”  
 
That’s it.  And then stop testing.  Remember to tell them to stop 
testing because otherwise they’ll be there forever, or sometimes 
they may end up over testing because they take a suggestion to 
release it again.  “Now, release that hand but feel good inside.  
Remember, the count of one, two, three.  On the count of three, 
coming back and feeling wide-awake and simply fantastic. One, 
two, three. Wide-awake.  Good job. Well, well done.”   
 
Now, this is very important what I just did here. Do you see this? 
“Good job. Well done.  You achieved an amazing thing.” But do you 
see how very straightforward it is? And really, after all of the 
rigmarole from this morning, this should be a no brainer, shouldn’t 
it?   
 
All right, so what we’re going to do now is get into groups of three. 
Assistants, please hang back.  Assistants please hang back, and then 
just jump in if a group needs a little thing.  You have groups of 
three, so this is my group right here.  I want you to do the full 
approach just like on the street. This is now your chance to do your 
full approach. Smile.  “Hey guys, you look like you’re having some 
fun here. You’re smart people. I’m a hypnotist performing here.”  
You know the whole spiel.   
 
Get both of them to do the whole thing through here. And when 
their hands are touching, go and put your hands together like this, 
choose one or if you want to do both, “Watch this.”  Then you go to

sleep. Give them something nice to think about.  Meanwhile, if his 
hands are still there going like, “Will I take my hands off yet? Is he 
going to do that to me now?  Oh my God, my hands don’t move 
anymore.”  So you might end up getting him by accident as well on 
the side. Does that kind of make sense?  Your focus will be here, but 
make sure this is your audience.  This is the person you’re playing 
to.  
 
 
So you’re done playing with him. Sleep, I’m not going to go – no one 
is going to see any of this stuff. Right? He’s my audience. I’m going 
to go here, “Sleep.” And go, “This is pretty interesting, isn’t it? What 
happened there?  Should we see where we can take this?”  “And I 
want you to feel good feelings” and we get this thing here, and he 
gets stuck.  Then go, “You try.  Let’s test his hand.  Pick the hand.  
It’s his hand, isn’t it?”   
 
Audience Member: “It is his hand.” 
 
Igor: 
“It is his hand it’s not moving anymore.  
 
 Audience Member: “It’s attached to his arm.” 
 
Igor: 
“You know this person, right? Does he normally stand around like 
this?” 
 
Audience Member: “No.” 
 
Igor: 
“Well, something must be going on.  You know what it is, don’t 
you?  It feels pretty damn good, doesn’t it?”   
 
So you see how you’re playing a little bit with the audience, and 
then you bring them in.  You’re not ignoring them anymore. They’re 
part of the whole thing.   
 
“Hand releases, you can feel good, all the way back into normal 
consciousness.” 
 
Anthony: 
Just one other quick note, and again, you’ll see we’re going to use 
very similar techniques which will be little tweaks that either of us 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
85 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
will add.  The timing for me on this, if I was going to use this as the 
induction –  
 
“If you put your hands out in front of you, clasp them tight, fingers 
about an inch apart, look at the gap between your fingers.  Hands 
together.  Look at the gap.  They’re going to touch like they’re 
magnets to get closer and closer. And when they touch, just allow 
your eyes to close, and sleep now.  Just relax.  Go deeper, deeper, 
deeper, deeper down.  Deeper and deeper, just relaxing. This arm 
can relax completely. Relax. This arm can relax, completely relax.  
Deeper sleep.  And one, two, three wide-awake feeling great.”  
 
 
So the timing for me is when they get to there, I know what’s going 
to happen, so I’m going to say in a moment, they’re going to touch. 
And when they touch, just allow your eyes to close and sleep.  And 
it’s like a plant trap here sort of thing.  So it’s just all I’m saying is 
that my kind of tempo is rising.  My energy levels are rising. And this 
is happening; this is happening, and sleep.  This is happening, do 
this and sleep.  I find that works quite well.   
 
So whether it’s the pull on the shoulder.  If you’re going to touch 
the back of their head, I saw someone earlier with their hand like 
this on someone’s head. But there’s absolutely no need to pull their 
head forward. No need to stick your hand on top of their head.  It’s 
just fingers out in front of you.  And when they touch, just close 
your eyes, and just sleep.  Literally, I just touch them on the back of 
the head. They’re going to know exactly what that means, and 
they’re going to let go. And that’s a big thing for me. The physical 
giving in, letting their head go, their shoulders go, relaxing like that 
in a public place is a good sign that they weren’t bored. 
 
Igor: 
And just remember the key thing here is just keep going. Once they 
have their eyes closed, just this place here – 
 
Close your eyes for a second. Then notice what Anthony was doing -
- then deeper, deeper, and feeling better and better. The deeper 
you go, the better you feel. 
 
Anthony: 
And we’re going to cover that in detail. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
86 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
But for now, just play with it.  Just go with it.  Just build an 
experience up for them.  The key thing right now is, really if you 
want to forget everything we just said, that’s fine.  Just put them in 
some kind of trance based on this and experiment. Explore 
different ways of doing it.  
 
Anthony: 
Give some suggestion. 
 
Igor: 
See where it goes. Come on back, and we’ll start refining it from 
there. Sound good? 
 
Anthony: 
And make sure that you behave like a hypnotist, in other words, 
wake them up properly. Tell them how they’re going to feel.  Don’t 
say all right, done now. Trust me.  If you’re doing this all day, you’ll 
end up with some very dozy, dopey people in here. So do a wake 
up.  And again, be energetic.  Expect them to be wide-awake and 
alert and feeling great.   
 
Igor: 
All right, guys.  Off you go. Let’s spend about a minute each or two 
minutes each. So we’ll be back in six minutes. I won’t turn you 
around.  Move as quickly as you can, and then we’ll go from there.   
 
Who surprised themselves with how much easier that was than you 
thought it would be?  Did you have fun with it?  So did you want to 
add some stuff? 
 
 
Build On Responses 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah.  Just a few little comments related to some questions that 
I’ve been asked along the way there.  As far as I’m concerned, 
everything you’re going to say is a suggestion. I don’t just mean that 
in the broad NLP sense of things.  I just mean as a hypnotist, 
everything that I’m going to say is a suggestion, and I’m wanting 
and expecting the person to respond to it. OK?  
 
So I just noticed when you three were practicing at the end there, I 
know we interrupted your practice. But he was kind of like putting a 
bit of a funny face like, yeah.  And maybe you were going for that 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
87 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
but I want to see his face relaxed. I want to know that.  If I’m 
observing him and watching him, and if someone is chewing their 
lip or chewing gum or looking around at their friends, I haven’t got 
their attention yet. So I’m not going to proceed until I get that 
attention.  
 
So I’ll first off make absolutely crystal clear what it is you want them 
to look at or be doing.  Personally, when I do magnetic fingers, I will 
demonstrate that look at the gap between your fingers. Don’t look 
at me; look at the gap between your fingers because in a moment, 
they’re going to touch. And then I’ll let go so they’ve got a crystal 
clear picture.  I’ll rehearse if I do the other one magnetic hands.  
OK? 
 
 
Obviously, we’re now getting to the point where most of you are 
saying sleep and essentially using this as an induction, which given 
all the convoluted and fancy advanced techniques there are out 
there may just seem too simple. Try and get back into the mindset 
of the average layperson.  A hypnotist clicks his fingers and says 
sleep and people sleep.  
 
So I spent a lot of time walking around the club four times before I 
actually got in it metaphorically, when I first started doing this.  You 
don’t need to.  Once you’re out there on the street, and your 
confidence starts to grow, then you can say look at me. Take a deep 
breath.  Close your eyes and sleep and get people.  
 
 
So we’re a couple of steps away from that with this magnetic 
fingers as an induction. Alright? As Igor said earlier, just keep 
talking. Once you done it just keep talking.  The first induction I 
normally teach on my course beyond this stuff is the handshake, 
Bandler handshake induction just too kind of get it out of the way.  
It’s like Anthony Robbins encourages people to walk fire on the first 
day of his course.  Otherwise, they spend three days thinking about 
it. Get it out of the way.   
 
You’ve done this induction, and I’m highlighting what you – just 
point out what you did.  Robyn has got some words.  Robyn is a 
hypnotherapist.  He’s got a lot of the lines in there. And one of the 
lines was, “As I rock your shoulder, you’ll relax.”  But it was just 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
88 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
coming out as a dry line.  Not that he wasn’t interested or excited, 
he was.  But he’s just saying, “As I rock your shoulder, you’ll relax.  
As you relax, I’ll rock your shoulder.”   
 
The point is everything I’m going to give to this person is going to 
be a suggestion. So if I put my hand on his shoulder, A) I’m going to 
tell him I’m going to do it.  “In a moment, as I touch you on the 
shoulder, you can continue to relax.”  Now that is an absolutely 
crystal clear suggestion.  “Continue to relax.”  How am I going to 
know if that suggestion has landed?  
 
 
Well, the only way I’m going to know is with this arm.  It’s with this 
bit of sensitivity here. So I’m not rocking his shoulder, making him 
tense wobbling his head off.  I am the friend who is saying, look, 
calm down.  It will be all right.  You’ll be fine. I’m just trying to shake 
a bit of tension out of his system. So when I put my hand on 
someone’s shoulder like that I’m saying, “As I rock your shoulder, 
you can continue to relax.  As I rock your shoulder, you feel your 
head moving, your neck relaxing, your shoulders relaxing.”  And I’m 
trying to get that feedback and, “Feel good about it.” 
 
When I did the thing to Martin earlier, and again, you can do this – 
my standard opener is what I did with Martin. That’s why I 
demonstrated it.  I’ve done this. I’ve done my induction.  I’m going 
to get into the structure, but I’m going to give him the suggestion 
first to build the expectation.  “In a moment, I’m going to touch the 
back of your hand, and it’s going to start to lift up towards your 
face.”  I haven’t touched it yet, but his mind is starting to think, “Is 
it? Why is it? That’s not going to happen.”   
 
I’ve got my hands moved together.  He’s chattering away in there.  
That little jabbering monkey is in there jumping around.  I accept 
that.  “In a moment, I’m going to touch the back of your hand, and 
it’s going to start to lift up towards your face.  Just like it’s being 
pulled up on an invisible wire.  Just like your hands are magnets and 
moved, you’re going to feel that hand beginning to lift up.  Now, as I 
touch the back of your hand, it’s going to begin to feel lighter and 
lighter and lighter.”   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
89 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
And if there’s no movement in that hand, I’m just going to keep 
hammering away at that until I get something.  He may need a 
touch.  He may need to do some visualization in his head.  I may 
need to sell it a bit harder.  In Martin’s case, I barely had a chance 
to get the suggestion in.  But I’m going to get that moving. And 
when I said to Martin, “As it lifts, you’re going to start to feel good; 
in fact, this is going to seem funny.”   
 
 
But because he was so quick, I didn’t get a chance to give my 
normal ratcheting up of suggestions, which is it’s going to feel 
funny. You’re going to feel good.  It’s going to seem funny to you.  
It’s going to put a smile on your face. That’s going to turn into a 
chuckle. That’s going to turn into a giggle.  That’s going to laugh.  
You’re going to laugh inappropriately.  I’d normally get all of that in 
in that period of time.  But because he was here already, I didn’t 
have a chance to kind of build up to that. So even with someone 
who is as capable as Martin proved himself to be, I had to work a 
bit harder.  I had to say now it’s like your favorite TV film, and 
you’re there. And it’s funnier than it was before.  Bang. And then I 
got the response.   
 
So I know we haven’t gone over deepening and using these physical 
movements and stuff yet, but a lot of you obviously favor this stuff. 
But mean what you’re saying and observer and see are they taking 
that suggestion?   
 
I noticed most of you are starting like this with your subject 
standing like this.  You may have said stand here, but they’ve still 
got their feet apart. That’s fine. You can hypnotize people with their 
feet apart.  It doesn’t matter. But if you got their feet together, if 
you put your feet together, he’s a marine.  I reckon I can push him 
over with one finger if I wanted to because there’s no way he can 
keep standing there.  Look, I’m taking him and he could kill me and I 
won’t even know what’s happening.  
 
The point is that with his feet together, I’ve got much more control. 
OK? I know I can push him over.  I know I can suggest him over.  If 
they’re like this, you haven’t got that amount of control. So one 
reason to have their feet together is there are other ways you can 
take this.  You can get into a postural sway.  You can get into a drop 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
90 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
back.  I don’t really want to put people on the floor in the street.  
But I have those options open. But I also know he has to trust me to 
stand there and be wobbled around.   
 
One other little tip in terms of this trust thing, as you’re dishing out 
those suggestions, I would say things like, “Your friends are around 
you. You’re safe, you’re well, you’re protected.” I just spit it out.  
“You’re safe and well.  Your legs will support you.  You will not fall 
over.  You’re perfectly safe and relaxed.  You can be aware of 
what’s occurring as you listen to my voice and dah, dah, dah, dah.”   
 
So just recognize that these words that are coming out after the 
induction have or should be said with purpose and should be said in 
such a way that ideally, you can get some feedback, and you can 
think yes, they are relaxing.  Yes, that head is feeling heavy.  Yes, 
their shoulders are relaxing. I want to see it.  And if I see anything 
else that looks good, breathing shifting, wobbling, eyes flickering, 
say it. “That’s right. Eyes flickering as you go even deeper.”   
 
So you’ve got choices about where you proceed. And again, we are 
going to get into this. But for me, it’s just go back to a physical test.  
I’ve done my induction now.  I know they can do physical stuff. 
They’re going to get another one. The hand is going to start to lift.  
Or if you put it there, you know you’re kind of getting into an 
emotional response, which is another great way of increasing 
someone’s abilities in my opinion. 
 
Igor: 
So let’s see a little bit more drilling around that whole thing 
because the concept makes sense, doesn’t it?  Let’s start putting it 
into practice a little bit. And something which will make your life a 
lot easier as hypnotists is a snowball effect, which is as soon as one 
suggestion gets acted out upon, the next one will be more likely to 
be acted out on as well.  Hence we do lots of little moves here, 
standing, and so on.  
 
So why don’t you count with me. I want you to do two things.  I 
want you to count out each time or stop me each time I present a 
suggestion that has worked successfully. And secondly, I want you 
to pay attention to how much attention do I have from my subject. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
91 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
And on a scale from one to ten where one is like no attention, ten is 
like if this guy were attending any more to you, his mind would pop.  
 
And I want you to stop me at each point when I’ve given a 
suggestion that’s actually gone through, that’s one.  And we’ll say 
okay, where’s the attention on a scale of one to ten. And you just 
tell me where you think it is.  Does that make sense to you guys?  
Easy? All right. Can I just borrow you because you’re here? Just 
stand this way over here would you.  You should be stopping right 
now, folks. Was that a suggestion?  Did he respond to it? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
This is not rocket science.  Did he respond to it? Yes or no? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So you should be saying stop at this point, shouldn’t you?  Let’s try 
that again. Would you come over here? 
 
Audience Member: Stop. 
 
Igor: 
Thank you.  Just put your feet together for me, would you? 
 
Audience Member: Stop. 
 
Igor: 
Great.  Where’s his attention?  What level?  One to ten? 
 
Audience Member: Ten. 
 
Igor: 
It’s not a ten. 
 
Audience Member: Seven. 
 
Igor: 
It’s up there.  It’s seven or eight maybe. We’re getting closer. OK. So 
would you look at me? 
 
Audience Member: Stop. 
 
Igor: 
Great. Where’s the attention now? 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
92 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Audience Member: Nine. 
 
Igor: 
It’s gone up a bit more, hasn’t it? Okay. Take a deep breath in.   
 
Audience Member: Stop. 
 
Igor: 
And breathe out.  Where’s the attention?  Did you see it ratcheting 
up each time his attention gets a little bit more focused on what’s 
going on here, right?  Okay. With your hands out like this, would 
you?   
 
Audience Member: Stop. 
 
Igor: 
Very good.  Interlock the fingers. 
 
Audience Member: Stop. 
 
Igor: 
Where is his attention?   
 
Audience Member: With you. 
 
Igor:  
No, what level? Eight, nine, ten, seven, eight, six, what? 
 
Audience Member: Nine and a half. 
 
Igor: 
Nine and a half.  Okay.  “Hands up like this.  Look at the fingers. Put 
them together.  And sleep, all the way. That’s right.  Deeper, 
deeper.” Now, why did I do that?  “The deeper you go, the better 
you feel.” Why did I do that?  I didn’t even bother with the finger 
magnets.  What’s going on there?   
 
Audience Member: He was already there. 
 
Igor: 
He was reaching pretty close to a ten, and I’m thinking God, I’m 
wasting all of my time doing all these other things because he’s 
there. Can you see the attention? Right?  “You kind of free coming 
back, fully wide-awake, feeling fantastic, one, two, three.  Good job.  
Well done, you.” Give him a round of applause.

So this is what I want you to do.  I want you to do the snowball 
effect. So you’re going to move someone around, and at each point 
in your mind, just count where is he?  Is he at a six, is he at a seven?  
Where is their attention?  If I’m here like what number am I at?   
 
Audience Member: Two. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah.  Somewhere around there, right. So how are you going to get 
me to become a little higher?   
 
Anthony: 
Now, just put your feet together if you would. And arms straight 
out in front of you.  
 
Igor: 
See what his hands are doing?  Do you see how he’s showing me 
how to respond?  If he gives me a weak response, it’s a weak 
response, and I go just stretch them out a little bit. I’m giving him 
the weak response.  What’s that going to do to his attention?  Not 
much.  I said all the way out. And I’m giving him physical suggestion 
for what I want his attention to do.  So that’s exactly what he’s 
doing to me.  His voice is giving me that energy as well.  
 
 
So always look at the attention level you’re at. And your next 
suggestion puts more energy in.  And some other little detail to test 
your attention again. 
 
Anthony: 
And one of the things we talked about is their fears and 
misconceptions and obviously some people’s fear is I’ll be 
hypnotized and I’ll do a lot of stupid things and humiliate myself. It 
may be less spoken about, but another fear is I won’t get it.  I won’t 
be able to do it.  I doubt I’ll be any good at it.  And they blame 
themselves when they’re not. And so having someone who is in 
control shows you what to do and is clearly the expert, does give 
your subject comfort.  It really does. And so they’ll do anything you 
ask if you ask them in a professional way with purpose. When 
you’re setting up all this stuff, even though you’ve done it 50 times 
now, continue to do it with purpose because later on, I’d expect 
you to hypnotize people by this point in time.  You’ll get people by 
that point in time.

Igor: 
So here’s what I’m going to do now just to really practice that and 
get that idea of locking people’s attention because that’s really the 
key thing, even when you approach,  “Hi, um.  How are you?  I’m, 
um, you’re looking good today.”  Do you see how I’m ruining my 
attention and it’s very difficult. “Could I do some hypnosis?”  I don’t 
even have his attention in the first place. Whereas if I come and 
say, “Hey, you look like you’re having fun here.” 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, thanks. 
 
Igor: 
“I’m the hypnotist.  I’m performing here.”   
 
Anthony: 
“Wow, I never met a real one.” 
 
Igor: 
“Well, here I am, or I’ll run if I’m a fake one.  So what we’re doing 
here is, I want to show people the power of the mind.  How easy it 
is to access things that they didn’t even know they had inside.  Do 
you want to play a little game with me?” 
 
Anthony: 
“Go on, then.” 
 
Igor: 
“Just stand over here, would you?”  
 
Just notice that each time I’ve got – where is his attention right 
now?  Five, six, something like that?  “Put your feet together, would 
you? Oh, you’ve done this before?” Do you see that little joke just 
raised up his level of interaction, raised his level of attention.  He’s 
committing more to the interaction. 
 
Anthony: 
I’ve got to be a bit sharper and more on the ball just too even – 
 
Igor: 
Just too even stay with the whole program.  Plus, he feels safe 
because I’m not embarrassing him.  I’m not going you stupid man. 
Put your feet together like a real person. We’re not going down that 
road. So he starts feeling more trusting as well. “So put your hands 
out.  Just put them out in front of you like this, would you?  Just put 
them all together like this, and just put them right out there.”  Now, 
did you see what happened to his eyes when I just pulled them 
forward? Right? Where did his attention go, up or down?   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
95 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Audience Member: Up. 
 
Igor: 
Right. So you see in each step, I’m escalating his attention. That’s 
what I care about.  If my voice needs to do it, my voice will go up. If 
my body needs to do it, my body will get involved. So Alex has a 
quick question. 
 
Audience Member: Can you overdo? 
 
Igor: 
Sure.  You an overdo it.  Sure can overdo anything. For the moment, 
I’d rather you over did it than under did it because most people 
under do it. 
 
Audience Member: But if you overdo it, can it be like the reverse effect? 
 
Igor: 
It can be. Well, the thing that will happen if you overdo it is people 
will back off like what’s going on here.  But don’t concern yourself 
about it now.  We’ll go through this, and we’ll soften the edges as 
we go. That’s for another time.   
 
Anthony: 
Good question. 
 
Igor: 
It’s a great question, and if we haven’t answered by the end of the 
day, we’ll come back to it. 
 
Anthony: 
If you pull back too many times, you’re going to annoy me. And I’m 
going to think, fuck off, I’m not listening anymore.  That’s just how 
it is. 
 
Igor: 
So what we’ll do for this exercise is I want you to get used to the 
snowball effect.  Just count the attention level you have right now 
and we’re going to go through all the preliminaries.  You’ll do your 
finger test.  You’ll do your hands coming together test.  You’ll do an 
induction. So you notice how there’s a lot of ground for that focus 
to get more intensified.  And I want you to do something very 
simple, maybe just a stiff arm. “Arm is stiff, ridged and stiff, and you 
can’t bend it. Try and bend it, you can’t.” Right? Or it could be an 
arm levitation. “That’s the hand coming up, floating, drifting up to 
your face, higher and higher,” whatever you want to do.  Honestly, 
right now, invent something.

Anthony: 
They would be good places to start. They’re both physical. And we’ll 
talk about the layering of effects.  If you’re working with someone 
you think, yeah, this is looking good.  They’re hanging out there.  
They seem comfortable. Then prove it to yourself.  This is where 
you’ve got to start to prove it to yourself, by testing your work.  
You’re going to hear me say this 100 times over the course of this 
weekend.  Test your work.  We all know that 99 percent of 
hypnotherapists never test their work, ever. They’ve never made 
someone’s finger remotely twitch.  You’re hypnotists.  You’re going 
to test your work. You’re going to stand by what you’re doing here.  
 
 
This is not all fake and an out and a physical trick. Start giving 
suggestions. And my advice is at this level is physical suggestions.  
“In a moment, I will touch your hand, and it will start to lift.  It will 
start to get lighter and lighter. That’s right. Lighter and lighter just 
like earlier when your fingers move like magnets.”  Just plow it until 
you get something. That is success.  That is success.  Anything in 
between is success.  I don’t care as long as I get a response because 
that’s when I can kind of start to build it.  
 
Igor: 
For the moment, there’s a lot of language things that we can add 
into this. We’re not really concerned about that just now.  I just 
wanted to get creative with getting the idea across. And the idea is 
very simple.  “When I touch your arm, it starts to lift.”  Now notice, 
it’s already lifting because I’m doing it.  At some point, I might let it 
do more of the work, and I’m doing less of it.  But the point is you 
get to play with it and find your own way, whether it’s the arm 
lifting or the arm is there or the arm is rigid.  I honestly don’t care 
for free movement, return.  Thank you very much.  I really don’t 
care what you do as long as you have that snowball effect. And the 
only question you ask yourself is where is their attention?  What 
level?  One to ten.   
 
 
Do I need more, do I need – or are they in a good place?  Later, 
we’ll start adding other things in here that will make this more likely 
to work, make it more powerful and all the rest of it. Does it make 
sense to you, guys? Go ahead, Alex. 
 
Audience Member: Just when you ask – what’s better, your hand can lift or – 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
97 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Anthony: 
Try both.  But I wouldn’t say count on that plan.  First of all, 
whenever I’m going to do any of this stuff, I will tell them what’s 
going to happen. So I’ll say – and I’ll set everything ever so slightly 
in the future.  “In a moment, I’m going to touch your hand, and it’s 
going to start to lift up towards your face.”  It’s a statement of fact.  
Tomorrow morning, the sun will come up.  It’s a statement of fact.  
It’s the same tone of voice.  “In a moment, I’ll touch the back of 
your hand. It’s going to lift up towards your face.  It’s going to get 
lighter and lighter, and it’s going to begin to lift up just like its being 
pulled up on a wire now.  It’s starting to go. Fingers twitching. You’ll 
feel those sensations.  Arm lifting, arm lifting, lighter.  You’re doing 
brilliantly.  Moving higher and higher.  Your head is a magnet. Your 
hands a magnet.” 
 
Again, just find 10 ways of saying the same thing and congratulate 
them and let them know they’re doing well because the other thing 
about it’s not just physical suggestions.  A lot of the suggestions are, 
“Am I doing this? Am I pretending?”  And obviously in a class like 
this, you don’t want to make the other person look an idiot.  You 
know, oh, I’ll go along with it, and that’s all cool.  That’s fine.  But 
what I want, and I want it from this point on, is that if you’re a 
hypnotist, you’re giving suggestions and meaning them and 
expecting them to land and be acted upon instantly.   
 
 
If you’re the subject, I want you to get into it rather than trying to 
follow the language patterns and all, I’ve got to do this in the 
moment.  It’s to get into it to concentrate on that arm, to imagine 
the lightness, to picture the wire, whatever the hypnotist is saying 
to you, and you’ll start to respond, and you’ll start to grow as 
subjects, which if you haven’t had that big experience of hypnosis, 
for some people, it’s going to be quite mind blowing and that’s 
when they’ll get it.  For those of you who aren’t the greatest 
subjects, and you don’t necessarily know that yet, you’re going to 
have to prove this to yourself. And it’s the same on every course.   
 
 
Some people get it by having the experience and realizing what it 
isn’t.  And some people get it by proving it with suggestion and 
saying that was real. That was a genuine response. I saw it.

So wherever you’re at, it doesn’t matter.  Many of you are looking 
like good subjects to me.  Just get into it, have the experience, 
accept that you’re going to have a little monkey chattering away in 
the back of your head. That’s what it does.  So let’s just practice and 
give some suggestion and test your work.  You don’t have to 
pretend.  You don’t have to act, unless you’re the hypnotist. 
 
Igor: 
So here’s what we’re going to do.  Let’s get the energy back up 
again. You know what you’re going to do in terms of the exercise. 
Same introduction and all the rest of it, all the way through the 
experiment until you do something, whether it’s an arm levitation 
or a stiff arm, or an eye lock. Something physical, something you 
can make up as you go along.  Does that make sense so far?  The 
way we do it is very simple.  In a moment, I’m going to tell you just 
to go, and I want you to walk around the room and point at objects 
or people and say exactly what they are as though you were a God, 
and you’re making them come into being.  
 
For example, this is a light.  Not it’s a light.  It’s a carpet. That 
wouldn’t be much of a carpet.  This is a carpet.  This is a light. This is 
a t-shirt with a funny answer on top. This is an Alex. I can tell 
because it’s written on his nametag.  But I want you to point at it 
because pointing changes your neurology. And when you’re 
pointing at it, it makes you a bit more definite about things.  Not 
this is a person.  This is a person.  This is a light.  This is a speaker.  
There is a camera.   
 
Once you’ve done that for a while, I’ll say find a partner. The first 
person you make eye contact with, you’ll go up and say, “Hi.  You 
look great today. I’m doing this little hypnosis thing.  I’m performing 
here.”  I don’t even care if it doesn’t come out properly. “I’m 
performing here. I want to show people the power of their minds.  
Can we do something really cool?  Step forward a minute.”  Notice I 
didn’t even wait for his answer.  “So step forward a minute, okay.  
Put your hands up like this.” And you’re rolling with the same 
energy, the same attitude, the same enthusiasm. Does that make 
sense?  I want that energy and what you’re doing.  Roll all the way 
through until you’ve done something that even surprises you. Off 
you go.  Start pointing around the room.

Cognitive Dissociation 
 
Igor: 
How are you guys doing?  Wasn’t that fun?  Come on. Let’s try that 
again. Was that fun?   
 
Audience Member:  Yeah. 
 
Igor:  
 
Come on let’s try that again. Who is having fun here tonight?  
 
Audience Member: YEAH! 
 
Igor:  
 
That’s much better. 
 
Anthony: 
Has anyone tested their work yet?  
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Anthony: 
Good. 
 
Igor: 
What did you guys get up to?  Did anyone levitate the arm? How 
many arm levitation in the room?  How many stiff arms were in the 
room?  How many catalepsies, like the arm just floats there in a 
weird position?  Anyone?  No.  Well, I guess stiff arm is close.  What 
about eyes? Anyone locked on their eyes? One eyes, okay. Anyone 
do nothing at all but just sit there and go, I don’t know? Excellent, I 
like that.   
 
So we want to keep that energy and that momentum going because 
that momentum is what’s going to get you to be a great hypnotist 
because that’s your unconscious mind doing the work for you 
rather than you sitting there going like, “Oh my God. I don’t know 
what to do.” Forget that.  
 
 
Trust your unconscious. How much better does it go when you’re 
not thinking? That’s weird, isn’t it?  This is not a thinking man’s art. 
The thinking happens at another point.  
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

So we’ll do the same thing, exactly the same thing. The whole 
snowball effect, the same getting excited, point at things so you can 
get yourself in that state of mind. This time, when you get your arm 
stiff or the arm stuck to something – anyone stick an arm to 
something?  One person stuck an arm to something. Good.  This 
time, whatever you do, you may want to stick the arm to 
something.  You may want to lock the arm.  You may want to do 
something different. That’s fine. What I want you to add now is just 
one little piece.  
 
 
I want you to separate a physical reaction, which is arm can’t bend 
from an emotional experience that happened as a result of it.  Now, 
that could be something like, “You could feel good in your body, 
and the better your body feels, the more this becomes stiff.”  Or it 
could be something as, get an emotion you’re attached to, “The 
more attached you get to that emotion, the better it feels, the more 
that hand gets stuck.”  Or it could be eyes locked down. “Think of a 
person you love.  The more you feel that person’s presence right 
now, maybe touching your shoulder like this, the more those eyes 
lock tightly down.”   
 
 
So you’re creating a separate between an emotional experience 
and the physical experience.  Does that make sense? Well, if that 
does, it engages the intellect and the emotional experience because 
it would have to verify it, freeing the body to have an unconscious 
experience, which is your suggestion. Does that make sense as an 
idea?  So you adjust those thoughts and nothing else. What I’m 
going to get you to do in a moment, we’re going to get you running 
around the room again pointing at things.  This time, I want you to 
say what they are not. This is not an elephant.  This is not a giraffe.  
Stay on the animal kingdom, you know, if you’re stuck on one of 
those things.  
 
 
The point is you’re doing the same thing with full conviction. This is 
not whatever it isn’t with full conviction.  
 
When I say find a partner, the first person they make eye contact 
with, that’s your partner, and just rattle through this.  It will take a 
minute or two, three at best.  It’s a real quick, easy thing to do.  Just 
get into that excited state of mind. And the best way to do that is 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
101 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
point at things and name them in the way that they’re not. Does 
that make sense to everybody?  Look for the emotional disconnect, 
the emotional and physical disconnect at the end. That’s going to 
be a real key facet to the whole street hypnosis thing.  It’s fun.  It’s 
easy to do.   
 
 
Now walk around the room and point at things and tell them what 
they’re not.  
 
Who is having fun here?   
 
Audience: 
 
Woo hoo! Yeah! 
 
Igor: 
Did you enjoy that? So now you’re starting to progress a little bit 
more.  It’s kind of weird. We started real slow morning getting used 
to the whole meeting people and so on. But now that our routine is 
– are you still using that whole routine when you’re introducing 
yourself to people from the beginning with a compliment and all 
the rest of it? Because that should really be your second nature by 
now. And now actually the hypnosis, by now isn’t that kind of 
straight forward and simple and easy?  Right? 
 
 
You were doing some pretty interesting stunts, hands stuck here, 
emotional responses coming out, and so on.  What we’d like to do 
now is just refine a little bit of what you’re doing and then stack 
something on top of that.  Is that okay with you guys?  So did you 
want to add some things on here? 
 
Anthony: 
Again, this is not the way to do it. I’m just going to explain how I do 
it in the vast majority of the situations.  Yes.  I’ll do magnetic fingers 
either as an induction or not. Magnetic hands, they’re in this 
position. Let’s imagine I can use one of those two things as the 
induction.  I don’t do a lot of deepening. There’s nowhere to 
deepen to. So to me, it’s kind of getting people used to where 
they’re at, letting them know they’re doing well, and giving some 
procedure instructions.  That’s what I’m going to do in the 
deepening.  Yes, I will generally put my hands on their shoulder and 
give them that feed, pace the lead if you know what I mean, off of 
the shoulder, as I said before.

“As I rock your shoulder, this is what’s going to happen.”  If I was 
going to do arm levitation, and that’s normally my next port of call 
whether I’m on stage or in therapy or anywhere else.  “In a 
moment, I’m going to touch his hand, and it’s going to start to lift 
up.”  Now, I said in the last section that this is success and this is 
success and anything in between those two points is success, and I 
mean that.  That’s what I call an analog test.  It just means that 
whatever happens, we’re going to get some result and we’re going 
to succeed.  A binary testing just means pass or fail, naught or one.  
Your hand is stuck to your chest. Your hand is stuck to your head.  
You can’t remember your name.   
 
 
Well, they either can or they can’t.  It’s not half there.  It’s not half 
stuck.  It’s not sticky.  It’s stuck or it’s not. So my personal 
preference and I keep saying test your work and I’m going to say it 
every time now, you get that hand lifting.  Hook it into a good 
feeling.  “As it lifts, you’re going to start to feel good. As it gets 
higher, you’re going to feel even better.  In fact, this will seem 
funny.” Again, this is an emotional test now, an emotional 
suggestion very similar to Igor’s picture a loved one and that kind of 
wording.   
 
If that is going really well, then at that point, I’ll kind of step back to 
physical tests, but I’ll do a binary test. That’s where I’m going to 
stick their hand to their head or their foot to the floor or whatever 
else. And a few of you at that point have been using the option of a 
stiff arm.  Okay? Now, stiff arm is – 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you there for half a second?  I just want you to 
emphasize that what Anthony is saying just to make it very simple.  
Notice how he’s built in hidden tests into his tests.  So you don’t 
really fail.  It’s not like, “Oh my God, is that arm going to stick or is 
the arm not going to stick?  Is that hand going to come off that 
table or chair or whatever?”   
 
You’ve preceded it with a soft test, which is if a hand starts 
twitching and moving, great.  You’re only half way there.  If they 
start having an emotional response, great.  You’re even further 
there.  Now, you can go back to the physical response, but ask for 
something more solid like the hand is stuck.  It cannot move. Your 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
103 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
arm is stuck to your leg.  It cannot move.  The arm is rigid.  It cannot 
move.  Do you see how there’s an escalation going on? Does that 
make sense to you guys?   
 
Anthony: 
And again, it’s not set in stone.  You understand, you can hypnotize 
someone, give them a suggestion for invisibility, and it can be 
taken.  But if you want to up your numbers and be able to have a 
number of exit points, that’s what it is for me.  I can entertain a 
table of people for 10 minutes with magnetic fingers and magnetic 
hands.  I can walk away and I’m still very much the hypnotist 
because I never said where it was going to go. I know I can do that.  
I know you can do that. And it’s just in this situation, increase your 
numbers in this game to increase the options you have. Then revert 
back to a physical test. But now they’re hypnotized. The difference 
is now this isn’t an exercise in concentration.  This is a routine now. 
So stiff arm can be a set piece or an exercise in concentration or it 
can be a routine.  
 
Now, I noticed just because I saw a couple of people going for this, 
they were just in the wrong gear.  I noticed you were doing this to 
someone and I think you may have even succeeded at it. But to 
increase the level of success when you get a stiff arm, if you come 
here for a moment, just put your feet together so they can see it.  
“And just close your eyes and sleep. Don’t fall over.  Just sleep and 
relax with your eyes closed as I rock your shoulder. Go into a 
wonderful place, a deep, deep, focused and relaxed state. You 
won’t fall over.”   
 
So just imagine you’ve got someone there, however you’ve got 
them there, and they’re listening to you as he’s listening to me.  
There’s various ways you can get into a stiff arm. But for me, a stiff 
arm requires you, the hypnotist, to have some energy to make this 
happen. And there’s various things about the arm that you want to 
do. So you can just say just put that arm out here, just straight out, 
make it completely stiff and rigid. And make that tight fist. So No. 1 
is I’m going to say make a tight fist and I’m going to slap it right on 
there. 
 
Igor: 
Notice there’s two things he’s doing.  No. 1, he’s locked the elbow 
out.  He’s already pushed from the elbow.  He’s telling the arm 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
104 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
what to do. Now, he’s giving it resistance, and that arm is naturally 
going to find resistance.  If someone pushes you, you push back. So 
it’s giving the arm some resistance in the direction it needs to go in. 
 
Anthony: 
Just be careful if you’ve got a ring.  You don’t want to rap them on 
the knuckle.  But make it a tight fist. So the No. 1 stage is, make it 
stiff.  Imagine that wrist is getting stiff, your forearm is tight, your 
elbow locked out.  Don’t push too hard.  You will hurt them.  And if 
you don’t know, your bicep bends your arm.  Your triceps 
straightens your arm. There’s actually a mistake on my DVD where 
I’m talking about your bicep.  Your bicep bends your arm.  That’s 
why if you do Kung Fu, you don’t have huge biceps. You have huge 
triceps because it straightens your arm.  
 
So I’ll always poke someone in the triceps because that’s what’s 
going to keep their arm locked out. As soon as I do this, there’s a 
good chance their arm is going to cave in a little bit.  So I’ll just say, 
“Make that fist tight, your wrist locked out, your elbow, even your 
triceps stiffer and stiffer up into the shoulder.” So I’ll just logically 
work up the arm to the shoulder.  “Stiffer and stiffer, stiffer and 
rigid like a steel bar.”  So I’ve gone from, “Make it stiff, imagine it 
stiff, like a steel bar, like it’s unbendable, it’s unbendable. Try and 
bend it and find it stuck, completely stiff and rigid.  You’re a strong 
guy.  You can put some effort in.” And now you can see, it starts to 
move.  You start to get that movement. It’s like an eye lock test.  
This is not going to last forever. 
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause there a second? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
So notice the isolation that he’s talking about here.  He’s gone from 
a voluntary act; make it stiff, to a voluntary imagination; imagine 
it’s stiff, to a kind of ambiguous act.  It’s like, it’s a metaphor, it’s 
like this, it’s like that, it’s a metaphorical thing.  And only then does 
it come to involuntary act. 
 
Anthony: 
It is that thing.  You can’t bend it.   
 
Igor: 
Yeah, it makes it reality. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
105 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Anthony: 
It’s unbendable. So when you try and bend it, you can’t bend it.  I 
haven’t actually really tested him and said try and bend it yet. But if 
I see that, I’ll say that’s right, tighter and tighter.  As you try and 
bend it, find you cannot.  Find it gets stiffer and stiffer and stiffer, 
tighter and tighter and tighter.  I’m still just preserving up the same 
idea. Tighter and tighter, stiffer and stiffer. And that’s when I’m 
going to open up to my audience because I’m not performing for 
him, and I’m going to say tighter and tighter.  You’re a strong guy. 
Put some effort in.  Try even harder.  So now he’s in a much – yes, 
there is mainly physiological reasons why this happens. But don’t 
forget, I’ve hypnotized him and made this happen.  
 
 
So I’m now there with suggestion, and now I’ve got a nice situation.  
I’ve got a binary situation.  He can bend that or he cannot bend it.  
And right now, he cannot bend it. So another step, it’s almost a re-
induction, but it’s an opportunity to get him in deeper, to get his 
attention.  To say, “I’m just going to touch your arm. When I touch 
your arm, it will drop down like a rag doll’s arm, and you’ll go 10 
times deeper asleep.  Ten times deeper asleep now, deeper, 
deeper, deeper down.  Sinking, floating, drifting down deeper and 
deeper to sleep.  And as you stand there, again, you will not fall 
over.  Your legs will support you.  You will fall over. But right now, 
when I click my fingers, you’re on the deck of a ship.   
 
 
“You’re standing on the deck of a ship.  You’re going to feel the 
waves moving the boat around.  You will not fall over.  You’re going 
to feel those waves getting a little bit choppier starting to move you 
around now.  You’re going to feel that force pushing you 
backwards.  You’ll just about remain on your feet.  Now, you’re no 
longer on the ship.  Just stop moving.  You’re no longer on the ship.  
Now, you’re back on the ship.  You’re going to feel those waves 
beginning to move you around again. And now you’re no longer on 
the ship.  But when you get on the ship this time, it’s going to be so 
wavy.  It’s going to be so choppy out there, and you’re going to feel 
this force pushing you backwards and forwards.  
 
That’s right.  I know it’s a strange feeling.  Now, you’re not on the 
ship, and I’m going to count to five.  When I count to five, you’re 
going to be wide awake and alert back in the room feeling fantastic.  
From this point forward, when I say the word sleep, with the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
106 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
intention to hypnotize you, you will immediately return to the state 
of hypnosis.  You’ll go twice as deep as before.  When I say one, 
two, wide awake, your eyes will open.  You’ll act perfectly on the 
suggestion you’ve been given.  Nod your head when you 
understand. That’s right. You have a super powerful mind. It’s 
working for you. Take this opportunity now.   
 
 
“Take a nice deep breath, and as you breathe out, let go of every 
negative thought, every limiting belief that you or anyone else has 
ever placed on you. Take another deep breath.  Let go of every 
negative thought, limiting belief that you or even just circumstance 
placed upon you.  Understand you have all the resources you need.  
You have a super powerful mind.  And when I say sleep, you’ll 
immediately return to this state.  Now, one, feeling slightly less 
relaxed now, you can loosen up your shoulders.  That’s right. Two, 
feel a surge of energy pouring in through those toes and fingers, 
arms, legs, spine, neck, to the top of the head.  Three, take that 
deep breath, fill your chest up, getting oxygen, filling it up.  Energy 
getting oxygen whizzing around your system. Four, your head 
washed through the cool spring water now.  Cool breeze cooling 
the back of the eyes, the nose clear, throat clear, chest clear, 
stomach clear. And five, eyes open, wide awake. Give him a round 
of applause.”   
 
Igor: 
A couple of things, if I can just pause what you are doing there.   
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, sometimes I get carried away. 
 
Igor: 
Notice how when he had his arm here, and it was stiff and rigid. 
Remember, there’s a physiological thing going on here as well. So 
you can just tape it in the wrist and it will work. But that’s what 
actually Anthony did was he didn’t just tap it.  He tapped it, and he 
moved it.  It helps to unfreeze the arm a little bit if it has got a 
physiological locking going on. So again, doing everything in that 
favor. 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. And again, I got sidetracked, that just the way it goes for me, 
but the point was when you did your stiff arm, it didn’t have a fist.  
It was like this, and it was like you’re playing it like a piano.  It was 
going to get stiffer and stiffer and stiffer.  It really is.  If I can 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
107 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
convince myself, it might stay there. And that’s just how it was.  So 
if you’re going to do something that involves tension and strength 
and strong, then that’s your game. That’s your tone. That’s your 
manner is that bang, bang; this is going to be like this.  This is going 
to be unbendable. Whack, whack, whack, bang.  It is unbendable.   
 
Not creepy, hope so, maybe, touchy, get off, stop touching me now.  
I know I said you could touch me on the shoulder a minute ago, but 
you’ve got to be in control. And if you raise your gear, and you’re 
moving more quickly, you got more tempo, they’ll accept it. They’ll 
think okay. And they’ll be boxed in by that, and they’ll pick up on 
that state. 
 
Igor: 
Remember, what you want to do is you want to commit to your 
action.  Now, remember, you’re not committing to the stiff arms 
right away.  It’s not like oh, it’s stiff now.  Oh, bend it.  You’ve gone 
through the whole process. Remember, this is part of well, they can 
go straightforward as well, and in time, you’ll do that, too.  You’ve 
gone through an escalation.  That hand is lifting, rising, lifting. And 
it’s lifting up. And you can feel great about that.  How do you feel 
about that?  Isn’t that amazing? The hand is up there all by itself, 
and you feel fantastic, don’t you?  Now, in a moment, what I want 
you to do is make a fist.  Make that rigid.  Make it stiff.   
 
 
So notice, you’ve gone through two layers of tests.  He’s already 
responded to your suggestions.  Now, you’ve got the physical 
mechanism going for you as well. So I’m testing.  You know, you’ve 
got the whole thing of whether the arm is working or not. Now, we 
can get him to test it, and you’ve got the whole escalation of well, 
make it so.  Imagine it so.  It will be like this.  Now, it is this.  Only 
now do you test it.  Do you see how much you’ve escalated to that 
point?  It’s a slow procedure. (Feel free to move it down here.) 
 
Anthony: 
And even the testing at that point when you get to that point, even 
the testing can be staggered in two or three or four layers. “So as 
it’s bending, you can feel its bent.  You can try and bend it and find 
it stuck.  That’s right. Try even harder.  Open your eyes and look at 
your arm.”  If they’re like this, the strongest test you can deliver at 
that point is, “In a moment, I’ll click my fingers, your eyes will open.  
You’ll look at your arm, and it will be absolutely stuck there.  This 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
108 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
will feel blah, blah, blah. Open your eyes.  How long have you 
known that you can bend your arm?” “My whole life.” “Put some 
effort in.” “Ahhhh!”  It’s just a gradual escalation. And a lot of 
people seem to get caught on this try and find you cannot.   
 
 
Yes, it’s a useful phrase.  But it’s not magic.  And people are, “Try 
and find you cannot, try and find you cannot, try, try, try even 
harder.” It’s like shut up.  Start speaking like a normal human being 
again.  You’ve said the clever line, now just tell him how it is and 
test it. 
 
Igor: 
Here’s the psychology of testing.  And I don’t even know how to say 
that if you go to the doctor or the dentist with a pain like a 
toothache or something like that, whilst you’re sitting there, you’re 
thinking like God, I hope the pain stays there so I can tell the doctor 
about it and not feel embarrassed. Anyone have that?  What 
happens to the pain? Does it persist or does it magically decide to 
go on holiday just when the doctor comes out, and you go, “Ah, it 
was here a minute ago, but it’s fine now.”  Why do you think that 
happens in the doctor’s office?  It’s not because he has magical 
powers.  It’s because you’ve been put in the position where you 
start to doubt your own experience.   
 
 
And that’s what this escalation is all about.  You’re putting their 
intellect in the position where they can begin to doubt their normal 
experience and that basically hands the plate over to the 
unconscious and says you deal with it because I don’t know what’s 
going on here.  
 
Anthony: 
And equally on the flip side of that, I’m trying to get my mind in a 
state where my doubts about them as a subject has disappeared. At 
that point, I don’t know if the stiff arm is going to take.  At that 
point, I’m feeling pretty good about it.  At that point, I’m thinking 
I’m going to be invisible in a minute.   
 
Igor: 
But do you see how he’s testing?  Even that was three different 
little tests. They’re invisible to the audience. You’re just doing them 
for your own things, so you’re not actually going for the big kahuna 
until you’ve gone all right, try harder. All right, this is pretty good.  
All right.  Now look me in the eyes.  Okay.  Now, I’ve got someone 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
109 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
who is really going for it. And you don’t go straight for it.  You build 
up; you shake the tree a little bit.   
 
Anthony: 
I’d like to – yes, got a question? 
 
Audience Member: Just a quick one.  When you started to count him back up, I got a bit 
confused because at one point, you said relax as you went up, and I 
thought – 
 
Anthony: 
Because he felt really tense. Because he still felt locked in.  You’re 
absolutely right.  You’ll notice when I do a wake up, and I’m going 
to go through why you should do a proper wake up later on, again, I 
up my tempo.  It’s very much wake up, energize, back in the room, 
eight hours sleep.  However, because I’ve done this to him and I 
ended him on, you’re not on the boat, he felt tense, maybe because 
he’s fit and healthy and muscle, but he felt tense. Okay. So I just 
said what I meant was just relax your body.  I didn’t mean wake up 
relaxed and dozy. But it is a very fair question.  
 
 
And again, it’s something that a lot of people miss at first is that the 
wake up is a wake up.  It’s not the deepener.  Wake up, and you’re 
going to feel so relaxed and refreshed.  So look, this is what I want 
to do just for a couple of minutes because this is where it’s going to 
start to go. I want to put a couple of you on the spot.  So you sir, 
pick your favorite subject.  Not Martin, not James, somebody else in 
this room.  Pick your favorite subject, and you’re going to run 
through this in front of everybody.   
 
Igor: 
And you know what, for the hell of it, be the real hypno man.   
 
Participant #1: 
That’s my favorite subject. 
 
Anthony: 
Great. Let’s get him up.  You’re the hypnotist.  You’re in control of 
this situation. If you want the mic, use the mic.  It’s a pain in the ass, 
I can hold it.  Just ignore us and do your thing, the whole shebang.  
You don’t know this man.  I want you to test your work.  If you can 
get to an emotional shift or a binary test, great. 
 
Participant #1: 
Cool.

Participant #2: 
More relaxed, shoulder, shoulder.   
 
Participant #1: 
Hi, there. 
 
Participant #2: 
Hello.   
 
Participant #1: 
I’m a hypnotist. I’m performing here in the street.  And do you want 
to learn something really cool about the power of the mind? 
 
Participant #2: 
Yeah. 
 
Participant #1: 
Excellent. Just stand right over here, please. Just put your feet 
together.  Great.  
 
Anthony: 
Yeah.  Just stand there just at a bit of an angle if that’s okay. 
 
Participant #1: 
This way, just this way here. Thank you.  Feet together please.  
Excellent.  Just put your hands together like this for me.  That’s 
right.  And close them like this nice and tight. Excellent.  Just focus 
right here.  And then bend them this way.  Just put your attention 
here.  And then go like this for me. Excellent. Just focus on the 
space here. And you’ll notice that it will begin to feel closer and 
closer and feel like there’s magnets there, pulling closer and closer 
and closer.  Just keep attention there.  Excellent.  Now, stiff all the 
way down, relaxed, all the way down, deeper and deeper, feeling 
better and better, all the way down.   
 
 
As you listen to my voice, get more and more relaxed, deeper and 
deeper you go.  Now, in a moment, I’m going to touch your left 
hand, the back of your left hand. And when I do, you’re going to 
find it’s going to feel lighter and lighter almost like it’s tied to some 
balloons. So in a moment, I’m going to touch your left hand. And as 
soon as I do, it’s going to immediately start to feel lighter and 
lighter.  Lighter and lighter, more and more balloons tied to the left 
arm. That’s right. Excellent.  That’s right. Isn’t that funny that the 
left arm is starting to move. Excellent. Well done.  Way to go.  
Excellent. Lighter and lighter.  Ten balloons, twenty balloons, fifty 
balloons.  Lighter and lighter. A hundred balloons.

111 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
And as your arm lifts, you’re going to feel better and better.  The 
more you feel better, the better it will lift. And as you continue to 
giggle, you’ll feel better and better as your left arm begins to move. 
And the higher it goes, the better you’ll feel. The higher that left 
arm moves, the better you will feel.  And it must seem funny to you 
that your arm is moving. And the higher it moves, the more you’re 
going to laugh. The higher your arm moves, the more you’re going 
to laugh like really laugh like an embarrassingly funny laugh that I 
know you know how to do.  The higher it goes, the more you’re 
going to laugh. That’s right.  Excellent. Excellent. All right.   
 
 
Now in a moment, I’m just going to touch your arm here. And when 
I touch your arm at your fist, you’re going to make a fist. Make a 
fist, strong fist.  Really imagine it tight.  Imagine it stronger, 
excellent. Really tight.  Like a steel bar.  Really tight like a steel bar.  
It is a steel bar.  Make it like a steel bar, like a steel bar.  Really, 
really push. Strong as a steel bar.  I’m going to try and pull down, 
and I can’t because it’s like a steel bar. Excellent. Wow, it’s really 
tight. Excellent.  Now in a moment, I’m going to snap my fingers, 
and you’re going to relax, all the way down.  Nice and relaxed. Nice 
and relaxed. All the way down, feeling incredible, feeling incredible.  
All right.  I’m getting excited about this, it’s kind of fun.   
 
 
I’m going to count to five, and when I get to five, you’re going to 
feel absolutely refreshed and awake.  Feeling incredible, taking your 
hypnosis skills out to the streets like the world class hypnotist that 
you are. All right.  On the count of one, you’re starting to feel 
energy into your body. Two, feeling your muscles getting tighter 
and more invigorated.  Three, feeling the energy and the air coming 
into your body. Deep breaths. Four, feeling invigorated, excited. 
Five, all the way back, eyes opened.  All the way back, feeling 
incredible.  And give him a hand.   
 
Anthony: 
Pick your favorite subject.  I’ll give you some feedback in a moment.  
Okay. Just be aware where the camera is.  I know it’s hard.  There’s 
so little range. 
 
Igor: 
I’ll just hover. I’ll be a shadow. 
 
Participant #2: 
Hey, how’s it going today?

Participant #3: 
Good, good. 
 
Participant #2: 
Good.  You look like a fun guy.  My name is Bob, I’m a state 
hypnotist.  I’m actually performing here in this room.  I’m teaching 
people about some of the powers of the unconscious mind. Would 
you like to play along? 
 
Participant #3: 
Sure. 
 
Participant #2: 
Awesome. Come on over and step over here.  Put your feet nice 
together and close for me. Right together just like that.  Excellent. 
Stand up nice and straight. Take a deep breath and bring your 
hands out in front of you and clasp them together just like that.  
Lock them nice and tight, nice and tight and strong.  Now, release 
your elbows.  Bring them in close.  Bring in the focus of your 
concentration there.  And bring your two fingers up and slightly 
apart.  And focus the attention inside those two fingers. And feel 
the release of your magnetic personality driving those fingers closer 
and closer together. That’s right.   
 
 
You’re doing very well. And as they touch, you can just allow 
yourself to sleep. Go deep, nice and relaxed, deeper and deeper. 
Your legs will support you.  More and more relaxed with every 
breath you take, you can let all of the tension go out of your body, 
and all new levels of relaxation going even drifter. Drifting, 
dreaming, deeper and deeper, more relaxed. Let your hands go as 
the relaxation deepens ten times deeper.  Nice deep breath.  In a 
second, I’m going to bring your hand up, and when I bring your 
hand up to your chest, I want you to just feel a sense of invincibility, 
un-stoppability in yourself.  
 
 
Bring your hand up, and stick it to your chest, and get in touch with 
your internal feeling of invincibility, un-stoppability, feeling stronger 
and stronger. As that feeling gets stronger, as your hand gets 
stronger, the stronger your hand is against your chest, the stronger 
the feeling grows inside of you. And as that feeling grows stronger 
and stronger, you’ll know that you can take that with you. In a 
second, I’m going to ask you to just pull your hand – try to pull your 
hand away. But as you try to pull your hand away, notice that that 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
113 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
feeling is so strong, so deep inside of you that even if you try, you 
could not pull your hand away. Go ahead and try now.   
 
 
And stop trying. And let that feeling of invincibility and un-
stoppability grow deeper and deeper inside of you.  Now, in a 
second, you can relax that hand.  Let it drop to your side.  And let 
that feeling grow all throughout your body, and know that you can 
take that with you anywhere that you want to go. That feeling of 
strength, of un-stoppability.  In a second, I’m going to reach down 
and touch your left hand, and as I do, you’ll feel that getting lighter.  
A sense of fun, a sense of fulfillment, get lighter and lighter. And 
you can feel your hand starting to come up as it gets lighter and 
lighter as if it’s attached to a wire or a bunch of balloons.   
 
 
It just keeps coming up, lighter and lighter. That’s right. And that 
feeling is growing inside of you.  And it feels really good.  Just allow 
it to come up, straight all the way up.  And that sense of fun, that 
sense of fulfillment continue to grow all throughout your body as 
you get in re-in-touched with that feeling of un-stoppability and 
invincibility.  In a second, I’m going to ask you to just move that arm 
out. Feel the strength.  Allow it to get stronger and stronger.  Feel 
that strength go all the way up to your hand. It’s as though it’s 
coming out at the end of your hand. All the way over to the wall.  
Now, make a nice, strong fist.  Make your arm strong.  Nice and 
strong.  
 
 
So strong, in fact, that if you were to try to move it, you could not.  
It’s a steel bar. That sense of power is going all the way out to the 
wall.  Go ahead and try to move it. Feel how strong you are.  Even if 
I push down on it, it will not move.  That is a sense of power and 
invincibility inside of you. But in a second, I’ll touch it. And when I 
touch it, you can let it drop no faster than you’re ready to allow 
that feeling to go even deeper.  Ready.  Relax, deeper and deeper.  
More relaxed, more comfortable, allowing that sense to just go all 
throughout your body.  And in a second, I’m going to bring you back 
up, but no faster than you can take your sense of fun and fulfillment 
and your sense of strength and un-stoppability with you wherever 
you go today, this week, and all the rest of your life.

One, becoming aware of the room around you. Two, feeling that 
energy come back into your body. Three, feeling your muscles 
getting stronger and more in control. Four, feeling that sense of 
invincibility, that sense of fun and fulfillment permeating your 
entire body.  Five, eyes open, wide awake, feeling great.   
 
Anthony: 
Take your seats. 
 
 
Student Debrief 
 
Anthony: 
Is this little moment, and you both – neither of you defined that 
moment particularly well. It was like and when your fingers touch, 
you can close your eyes and just sleep. And it was kind of just, in 
both cases, it was like a beat or two too late.  If you watch the video 
again, you’ll see it.  They don’t know whether you want them there 
or not. And in the end, you’ve had to kind of drag them forward. 
Whereas, if you’re on the rise of these energy levels again, closer 
and closer, you do it brilliantly. And when they touch, just close 
your eyes and sleep now, just sleep.  Just relax.  It’s going to happen 
at that judged speed.  You’ve got millimeters to go, and when they 
touch, allow your eyes to close. Close your eyes and sleep.  
 
 
So just try and get that moment a bit tighter, especially if you’ve got 
an interesting stage hypnosis or some of you have, you’ll miss 
people.  You’ll lose people because their attention is not quite with 
you at that point. Whereas if it’s here, here, here, here, close your 
eyes and sleep, you’ll have a lot more success.   
 
Igor: 
And I was thinking about something else. Just note that this is about 
the numbers game.  In other words, what you’re doing will work 
and it will work great.  We’re talking about how to refine it so that 
your numbers go up because this is literally a numbers game. And 
the more you have the little working mechanisms all tidied up, the 
more people will respond to you. If you do a really slap dash, poor 
job where it would be embarrassing to say we’ve ever trained you, 
chances are you’ll still get one in a hundred people, one in 
whatever number of people will go really, --?  So it’s not that you’ll 
fail.  It’s that you’ll succeed more often with – 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
115 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Anthony: 
And you’ll get further down through the chain of phenomena and 
the process. That’s how I really see it as a process I’m trying to step 
through.  A couple of other points, I don’t know if you’ve already 
had some training, but if you’re going to do a stiff arm, they both 
did a fantastic pseudo test to the stiff arm, which is I push it down, 
it goes up again.  I push it down, it gets even stiffer, which is 
fantastically convincing for the person who is having it done on 
them. But it’s visual for everyone else who is watching. That’s when 
they’ll start to point and say look, check him out.  It’s really starting 
to happen.  So if it’s stiff, it has to go back up again, but it’s a nice 
test. 
 
Igor: 
And a nice thing you can do with that as well, just in case you’re 
wondering, is if there’s other people involved, which street 
hypnosis will have, get their friends.  “Go on, push down, its okay.  
Push down.” That involves the rest of the group, and they’ll go I’m 
touching a hypnotized person.  Well, I’ve touched a hypnotized 
person. And you laugh, but that’s exactly what’s going to happen. 
And then someone might say will that hypnotize me?  Well, find 
out.  And if they’re like that then you might as well go sleep through 
them as well because if they’re there already – we are in probably 
one of the most, what’s the word I’m looking for, scavenger 
professions you can find.   
 
 
In other words, things will happen in front of you. You either use 
them to amazing effect or you miss them. Right? Can we do 
hypnosis on purpose, in other words get the effect by setting up 
and all the rest of it?  Yes. But honestly, that takes a long time 
because you’ve got to maneuver the unconscious mind to that 
position.  When they’re there though, I mean, you saw with this 
gentleman here, James, and the ship thing.  You saw him swaying a 
little bit. So we just put a construction around what’s already going 
on and some is more dramatic because it’s already happening. Does 
that make sense? 
 
Anthony: 
I’m going to step back into the physical effect because I was feeling 
pretty confident about James at that point. But I’m not rushing on 
to hallucinations.  Someone rocking back and forward and we’ll talk 
about the fact that that will knock people over; you do not want to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
116 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
do that when you’re in a bar or on the street.  It finishes things very 
quickly because bouncers just assume they passed out. But if you’re 
going to do that, again, everything is a suggestion.  “You’re on the 
deck of a ship.  There are waves.  You will not fall over.  Your legs 
will support you.” They’re very strong suggestions. Very often, I find 
people are like this, and I’ll say, “Your legs will support you.” They 
do this.  Like only just because it’s a suggestion that their legs might 
only just support them.  So that was good.  Just a couple of other 
points. 
 
Igor: 
Can we just have a question before we go? 
 
Audience Member: What would be the exit strategy if the subject would just bend his 
hand in front of everybody?  Just, haaah. 
 
Anthony: 
Hm, it’s difficult. We haven’t quite come onto all these outs. We are 
going to cover it.  Sometimes they do.  Sometimes they’ll just lose 
the attention.  It’s fragile.  It’s a relationship as far as I’m concerned.   
 
Igor: 
And a simple out, if you want to have like a general cover all clause, 
I call it wash, rinse, repeat.  Go back to the previous thing that 
worked. Right? Then basically, get them to forget that the failure 
happened, then do something else. Either if you have the guts for it, 
do this one again.  You just reset it with a deep, new fractionation. 
Or if you just want to have a simple out, you’ve had enough, you 
want to get out, do one of the simple cheats like the eye roll, which 
will succeed as long as they follow instructions.  And then the last 
thing on people’s minds will be it was a successful demonstration. 
Right?  So you either have a simple out, which is one of the cheat 
methods. We’ll have plenty 
we’ll show you later on, maybe 
tomorrow, to have simple outs.   
 
Or my preference is you bring them back a step.  You deepen the 
trance, and you re-suggest it again. This time escalating more 
carefully because probably all that means is one of two things, 
either they were not fully instructed in the first place.  Hopefully 
you’ve ruled that out already.  Or you said it too soon. “Your arm 
can’t bend. It’s stiff and rigid, stiff as a board.  Try and bend it.”  Oh, 
did I do any pretests?  It’s only a subtle test. All right.  “It’s - make it 
strong.  Make it strong and stiff and rigid.”  Okay. Now, I’ve got my 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
117 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
first test. Can I feel his arm strengthening?  Absolutely.  It’s like an 
iron bar. 
 
Anthony: 
Exactly.  It’s like maybe the hands on the shoulder.  This is a probe. 
 
Igor: 
I’m probing, I’m testing him already.  If his arm is all loose and bent 
here and going like oh, I don’t think I’m there yet, I’m going to put 
more energy into this.  “It’s like an iron bar. Stiff and rigid like an 
iron bar.  You cannot bend it no matter how hard you try.  This arm 
will not bend.  It’s a solid piece of wood.”  Notice I told him what it 
is, but I haven’t actually tested it yet. And if he starts bending it, I’ll 
say, “Not yet.  Solid, strong, stiff, rigid.” Right?  Then say, “Like an 
iron bar. Test it and see. Try it for yourself.”  Right?  Now, it’s a little 
bit.  “Go on.  You can do better than that.” So notice I’m doing more 
now. Right? “No. Open your eyes.  Look at this, look at this. What’s 
going on here?”   
 
 
So you see I’m escalating the test.  What you’re not doing is going 
straight for open your eyes, look at him, try and bend it. 
 
Anthony: 
No. Exactly, and another few things, Bob added some emotional 
involvement to magnetic fingers.  You can do the same thing with 
an arm.  He said bring the force of your magnetic personality to 
bear, or whatever he said, but that’s good because you’re taking a 
little step into the emotional realm.  With a stiff arm, again, even if 
it’s not that strong, there are still – you can still snatch defeat from 
the jaws of victory here. So they’re here, and you start to test. 
Sometimes, as it starts to bend, I’ll just say as it bends a little bit, 
straight back out. That will catch people.  That will get people 
sometimes because to bend your arm is to do this. But they’re 
actually struggling.  
 
 
We haven’t got a complete win. It’s not a binary test. We haven’t 
got a complete win. But why are they not just bending their arm? 
So that’s right, it’s really difficult and they just hinge right back out 
again. They just straighten it right back out, and I might even help 
them along with that. 
 
Igor: 
If you want to cheat a little, you say just straighten this right back 
out again. I’m telling the muscle, which is responsible, and I’ve got a 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
118 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
little bit of the thing there.  Now, I’m not saying straight is out, and 
don’t you move it. But I’m giving little suggestions like if it 
straightens right back out again, that’s a little shock to the system. 
The muscles may do a little spasm, snap back out, and then go oh, I 
felt my arm go again. Of course you did.  I told the muscles 
responsible what to do. But do you see how you’re just rolling all 
these things together to stack the odds in your favor? 
 
Anthony: 
If you set it up properly, it will very rarely bend. 
 
Audience Member: So would you say that’s the emotional payoff to the physical thing 
every time is okay? 
 
Igor: 
He doesn’t have to do it every time. 
 
Anthony: 
No. And we’re getting into the realms of theory, and that’s 
particularly something that’s important to me or has become 
important is that more and more and more, I know that when 
someone is at a high level of emotion, raging, jealousy, anger, in 
love, whatever, they’ve got black and white thinking.  This part of 
their brain essentially shuts down, and all they’ve got left are two 
choices. My feeling is that that must be a spectrum.  So I aim to 
raise the person’s level of emotion. Saying hypnosis raises their 
emotion.  Making them the star, doing the set up correctly, is going 
to raise the level of attention, and it’s going to raise their emotion.   
 
 
Getting them to invest parts of their personality or loved ones or 
feelings into these tests raises their emotion. Telling them how 
good they are, how brilliant they’re doing, how powerful their mind 
is raises their emotion. And once you actually get into the bigger 
routines, you’ll notice lots of stage hypnotists do it, there’s a million 
pounds riding on this. It’s the final of the X factor.  It’s not just sing 
us a song.  It’s you are the world’s greatest guitarist on the biggest 
stage.  You are Michael Jackson, the world’s greatest dancer. 
 
Igor: 
Plus, it pulls every one as well because you have more drama. So do 
you have to use emotion?  No.  You don’t have to use emotion. But 
it does stack the odds in your favor, so why not?  It’s an easy thing 
to do, especially tomorrow when we come onto gifts.  Emotions are 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
119 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
really going to be the home that tells you whether the payoff was 
hit or not.  So it’s a simple thing to add in.  So you may as well do it. 
 
Anthony: 
But they both did great.  If either of these guys came up onto the 
street and gave that as a demonstration, I wouldn’t walk away 
thinking oh, but he didn’t actually hypnotize anybody, did he? He 
didn’t make anyone do anything they don’t want to do. I would just 
say that was weird, wasn’t it?  Couldn’t you bend your arm?  No.  I 
kind of thought I could, but when I tried, it – you know, they’re 
going to dive into that conversation themselves. So they were good 
demonstrations, and there are kind of fine points, but just tighten 
them up.  I like the fact that you did – once you had him 
hypnotized, you used his arms. This arm came up.   
 
 
You made it funny.  Again, don’t forget that if they take one 
suggestion, stack the next one.  You want them feeling good, that’s 
one thing.  You want them laughing, well, you started to laugh. You 
got Bob laughing, and I want him laughing with complete abandon.  
I want him laughing hysterically.  He’s laughing hysterically, let’s 
really test it.  Let’s make him laugh in a ridiculous fashion.  This isn’t 
going to humiliate him. But I’m testing.  I’m testing.  I’m getting 
bigger. I’m growing I strength and confidence in my subject.  In a 
second, they’ll just say when your eyes open, you’ll stop laughing 
but you will not be able to remember your name.  
 
 
It will be gone, vanished, gone from your mind.  And at that point, I 
can say with conviction. 
 
Igor: 
Notice the escalation once again.  Everything is coming right at the 
tail end of something else, and that’s not in a moment, you’ll open 
your eyes, and then you’ll forget your name. Forget, forget. 
 
Anthony: 
No more English. 
 
Igor: 
Because how many opportunities is there to come back into it and 
go hang on a second, this isn’t it. Whereas it’s have you ever been 
like snowballed into a decision you didn’t like?  Like someone says 
oh, let’s do this, and you go no, no.  Well, just do this or this, and 
suddenly, you’ll find yourself in the middle of something going why 
am I agreeing to all of this?  That’s kind of what’s going on here in 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
120 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
some ways as well.  You’re basically putting your intellect on hold 
because so much stuff is happening.  They literally forget to not do 
it.  Make sense? And by the time they find themselves in it, well, 
now they’re having experiences like wow, I didn’t expect this to 
happen.  
 
 
But it’s only because they forgot to keep normal reality going 
because that’s really all it is. When someone bends their arm, what 
they’re saying is I’m re-establishing normal reality, and you don’t 
want that.  You want them to forget about normal reality for long 
enough to have something weird happen and somebody go wow, 
what’s that? So hence that snowballing effect means you require a 
certain level of momentum. 
 
Anthony: 
And one other little point and we’ll come back with a few ways of 
what if they just bend their arm and ways to avoid that. The other 
thing, and you’ll notice the – you may not have noticed it, but he 
did it earlier on, is you just cut the test really short.  If it’s like your 
hands there, you’re feeling this, and when you’re feeling that, your 
hand will be stuck, try and move your hand.  And there was a bit of 
movement in his hand.  You might not have even seen it from 
where you were, but there was a bit of movement.  It wasn’t like 
that.  It was this much. And that’s when I just stop testing and go 
even deeper. Again, that doesn’t mean you’ve lost that subject.  It’s 
just that’s how far you’re going to push the test.  
 
I was in Dublin last weekend or whenever it was, told a girl she 
would forget her name, and she did forget her name. She came 
around, big blank expression. All of her friends were like Chloe, 
Chloe. That’s a gag on stage is Richard, what’s your name?  It’s on 
your name badge.  Oh yeah, what’s your name?  They can’t say. 
Richard, come on. Try and tell me your name.  It’s a joke. But in that 
situation, even though she was absolutely hypnotized, it was the 
first real mental test I’d given her beyond the physical and the 
emotional stuff.  It’s my first real cognitive test.  
 
 
So you will not be able to remember your name. Eyes open. Chloe, 
Chloe, your name is Chloe.  No.  My name is Bobby Camelhumper.  
No.  Chloe, Chloe. And I just thought this could break. This could 
come undone here. So you’re name is not this, it’s that. And it gave 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
121 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
her somewhere to go.  It gave her somewhere to move.  So if it’s 
testing, testing, testing, starting to go.  Let her stop testing and 
sleep and relax; that sort of thing. 
 
Igor: 
Just remember the general adage, where attention goes, energy 
flows.  And at all points as a hypnotist, you’re asking yourself, 
where is their attention now?  Is their attention on the spot to 
release?  Is their attention on oh, I can start to bend this? Or is the 
attention on like why isn’t it bending?  Right? If their mind is going 
in the wrong direction, give their mind something else to focus on, 
some other direction to go on. That might mean you’re going to 
forget about the sleep, forget about that.  Let’s do something else.  
Or it might mean you give him a little tweak and say, “That’s it, it 
bends a little bit, but it bounces right back again.” You just redirect 
their attention.  
 
 
Always think about where is their attention and how much of it do 
you have.  Because if you don’t have all of their attention, there’s 
going to be some spare attention floating around doing all kinds of 
other stuff, and you don’t know what it is.  It could help you, but it 
could hinder you.  Let’s not have any attention gremlins running 
around. Right? Let’s be in charge of what’s going on.   
 
Can we have the microphone over here? We’ll have a couple of 
questions, and then we’ll have a break.  We’ll start here, and we’ll 
come up to you in a second. Can you move a little bit away from 
that speaker just in case? 
 
Audience Member: Sure. Check, check, is it on? Commitment and consistency, when 
you just suggested that if Bob is laughing hysterically, and the next 
one up is maybe wake him up, and then make him forget his name, 
is it kind of based on well, if he did this, to be consistent, then he 
has to do this maybe a little bit more outrageous thing because he 
just did an outrageous thing? And you keep building it so that he’s 
consistent in his character, let’s say. 
 
Anthony: 
I appreciate what you’re asking, I think.  I don’t look at it that way.  I 
don’t look at Bob’s role, the subject’s role, as having anything to do 
with having to be consistent. Well, I don’t say I’m Michael Jackson. I 
guess there’s no reason why I shouldn’t play the guitar like blah, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
122 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
blah, blah. I don’t really look at it that way. I want his attention 
locked on the idea I’ve presented. Finished. 
 
Igor: 
A bit more like momentum. 
 
Audience Member: But I mean consistent in terms of if he was outrageous here – 
 
Anthony: 
But who is thinking this?  Outrageous to who?  He’s just being. 
 
Igor: 
He’s like a rabbit in the headlights.  He’s like I don’t know where to 
go, and you’re saying move left. All right. That’s kind of the position 
you’re in. The momentum is guiding them through the experience. 
Then not having any cognitive process to say I guess I said I’d do 
this, and now I should do that.  It’s more a question of where is he 
taken. 
 
Audience Member: My follow up is when you just said this might now break, that’s 
what I was trying to get to is how far can you take before you get 
the feeling it’s going to break? 
 
Anthony: 
It’s just to forget that feeling to be honest. Her friends were really 
pushing it.  It was Chloe, Chloe, Chloe, and yes, it was amusing.  But 
I haven’t finished with Chloe yet. So as far as I was concerned, it 
had been tested just like in Igor’s first demo there. This is being 
tested.  It’s only been tested for two seconds, but it’s been tested.  
He’s still a hypnotist.  Now, stop testing and relax.  Send that feeling 
through your entire body.  Why wouldn’t you?  It’s a good feeling.  
And your arms relaxed.  He’s back on top again.  He’s in control. 
 
Igor: 
And the major thing is the next time I do the same exact thing 
again, it’s going to stick even more closely because of 
representation inside his mind is, well, last time it stuck, I guess it 
will stay stuck this time, too. So you can actually fractionate these 
tests as well, and they’ll become more and more profound each 
time.  
 
Audience Member: We might be going through this tomorrow, but I’m concerned 
about Chloe and the fact that she’s forgotten her name.  How do 
you come out of that so that she then does remember her name? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Anthony: 
Close your eyes, sleep.  Of course you can remember your name. 
Your name is Chloe.  Everything is back to normal. 
 
Audience Member: Alright, okay. 
 
Anthony: 
Again, when I first learned stage hypnosis, the reading Ormond 
McGill and stuff, the rule was you give a suggestion, act it out, you 
undo that suggestion.  That’s not the case.  You don’t have to do 
that.  You can stack them up with suggestions.  There are some 
thinking they might get a bit mentally overloaded.  I haven’t had 
that experience to be honest.  However, if you do your wake up 
properly, then there are suggestions within the wake up. But all the 
silly suggestions are gone, and everything is back to normal.  So I’ve 
had moments where I’ve forgotten to undo a name change. And 
they were just back to normal and someone has asked them their 
name, and it’s still Jenny Camelhumper III.  
 
 
But that’s their name until you properly undo things.  For others, it 
won’t.  Assume because you’ve done the wake up, everything is 
back to normal, and they’ll behave in that fashion. 
 
Igor: 
But it brings up an important ethical issue, which means when 
you’re doing street hypnosis, stick around for a minute or two after 
you’ve finished for a little while.  Make sure the person is okay.  
Don’t just go thank you very much and run.  How was that?  That’s 
amazing. And then you can do little indirect tests with them as well. 
So Chloe, how did you find it? Oh, it was good. And then people will 
ask her what’s your name or can you remember that?  Listen to 
how they’re responding because really, people are putting 
themselves in your hands, so you want to make sure that you leave 
them off better than you found them. That’s just about the ethics. 
 
Anthony: 
We’re going to cover all of this in health and safety and ethics later 
on.   
 
Igor: 
But these are good questions.  Do you guys feel good?  Has this 
been useful so far? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah.

Igor: 
You enjoyed watching that?  I want you guys – we’re going to take a 
little break now, so I want you guys, when you go to your break, just 
start thinking about how you can start putting your own little 
routine together like that because after the break, we’ll start 
snowballing these things more and building up more effects.  You 
notice how it’s just a question of stacking effects on top of each 
other?  And we’ll start giving you strategy about that later.  
 
For the moment, just think about what kind of effects you want to 
stack on top of each other.  You’ve done this.  You’ve done that.  
Right? Some of you have done this.  Some of you have done this.  
So see what you can stack on top of each other to create a little 
routine, five or ten minutes of entertainment, that makes you feel 
good, makes them feel good. And then we can start polishing it up 
to make it more strategic in terms of what you’re trying to achieve. 
Sound good? All right, guys. Let’s have a 15 minute break. Be back 
in here in 10 minutes so we can start on the dot.  Off you go.

Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
So did you enjoy what we were doing before the break and the 
direction I was going in?  Hopefully, you’ll see that really, there’s 
nothing that these guys were doing that you couldn’t do. There’s 
nothing that we’re doing that you can’t do.  Perhaps, we’ve refined 
and polished a few of the little bits in between a little more, but 
that will come with practice and experience. And really, where you 
are right now is just at that point.  A lot of you were asking during 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
125 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
the street demos what do I do now?  I’ve got their fingers sticking 
together.  Now, what do I do?  Do you now have an idea of how far 
you can take people just with these simple routines?   
 
 
Sticky hands, sleep, happy feeling, arm levitation, arm stuck, even 
better feeling. Do you see where you can take all these things?   
 
Anthony: 
The big secret according to well-known stage hypnotists, do your 
hand lock, which is the standard way of pulling people out of the 
crowd on stage.  And they march on stage with their hands stuck 
together.  They’re already hypnotized. That is it. They’ve taken at 
least one idea on board. 
 
Igor: 
Why else would their hands be stuck.  It doesn’t happen every day. 
 
Anthony: 
The big induction, the dropping on the floor, the deepening, it’s all 
bit of a flourish to be honest. If their hands are stuck, there’s no 
reason why, when they become unstuck, the next thing that you 
suggest will not take hold.  So sticky fingers is hugely valuable if you 
can push it into becoming a binary test where they’re stuck, where 
it’s immovable. And I was trying to explain this about the stiff arm. 
The stiff arm to me is no stronger a test than the eye on the head.  
The fact is you can do a stiff arm without hypnosis, without 
suggestion, just by giving the person the instructions and them 
interpreting the instructions and carrying out.  However, when I do 
a stiff arm, I’m still going to stack all the physical bits in my favor.   
 
 
My sole intention is to make their arm stiff with suggestion.  I want 
the person to essentially be able to relax in the end and look at 
their arm it be unbendable, to ponder over it, to talk about it, to 
reflect on the fact that it’s stuck.  To achieve that, I’ve got to make 
it happen with suggestion.  If I’m just relying on the tension and the 
trick element of it, then I’m going to struggle to talk to them and 
get them to observe and reflect. And ultimately, that’s where I’d 
like to be, same with the eye lock.  You know, when they test their 
eyes, that’s right, stop testing, sleep. That will get the vast majority 
of the people, even if they’re thinking yeah, but I don’t think I can – 
they will be gone.

So again, just keep your intention in the right place, your 
expectation in the right place, and that will make it much easier for 
your subject, even though you know that some of this stuff is based 
on the physiology in a body.  Your job is to make it happen with 
suggestion to ensure that it sticks, takes, and the loop that’s playing 
in their mind then is I can’t bend it, I can’t bend it, I can’t bend it, I 
can’t bend it.  And then you know you’ve got them. Okay.  So we’re 
going to get into this again.  We’re going to teach you some more 
techniques. We’re going to go over this another hour or so. 
 
Igor: 
And then we’ll be out on the streets, and we’ll be doing it with real 
people.  Just ask a quick question for a second.  Let me just give you 
this. 
 
Audience Member: A really quick one.  You know when you said just now, that the test 
is if they’ve got their hands locked together, is there like a 
timeframe between you getting say, from the audience down to the 
front if their hands come unstuck.  Or you haven’t made another 
suggestion within a certain amount of time, is it that much harder 
to get them to go back into it? 
 
Anthony: 
No. Well, it’s going to be hard.  If they’ve committed to their hands 
being stuck, great.  If you’ve done your work properly, then you’ll 
say keeping those hands up where I can see them, walk up on 
stage.  I will unlock them for you. All this kind of stuff is a suggestion 
to keep them where they are. Sure, some people when you say now 
come up on stage just do this.  That doesn’t mean they were faking.  
It’s just their interpretation of just come up on stage is I walk on 
stage. But I would still expect to be able to hypnotize that person in 
a second.  Literally, look at me.  I would expect them to be out if 
they’ve committed to that.  
 
 
There’s physical reasons why that’s difficult to undo, but it’s not 
100 percent.  You have to make that happen with suggestion.   
 
Igor: 
Even more so with this, right?  So I think we’ve done enough talking 
for the moment.  I think you guys got the general idea.  Let’s have a 
couple of questions if we need to.  But we’ll try and get into 
something action oriented very quickly because this is, after all, 
about you guys and what you’ll be doing very soon.  So go ahead.

Audience Member: Okay.  I had a question on the awakening part, that five count.  I 
actually lost track of numbers, and I didn’t know what to do.  After 
a while, I’m like okay, your body feels good.  You’re doing great, 
you’re breathing.  Okay.  Your body isn’t good. 
 
Anthony: 
We will go through that.   
 
Igor: 
For now, the simple rule on how to do an awakening, and we’ll give 
you step-by-step stuff later if you want.  A simple rule is tell them 
what’s going to happen and at what point. So I’m going to count 
from three, coming up to five. At the count of five, you will feel this, 
this, this, and this, and that’s it. One, coming up slowly. Two, 
getting close to that. Three – 
 
Anthony: 
All the silly suggestions gone, full of energy, feeling great. 
 
Igor: 
All the rest of it. We’ll give you some interesting things you can put 
into awakening as we go through.  For the moment, just literally 
give them the process. I’m going to count from one to three.  Tell 
them what’s going to happen at the end of the process.  Your eyes 
will open.  You’ll be wide-awake, and all the suggestions will be 
removed.  You’ll feel fantastic. Then you do the process.  One, 
coming back. Two, take a deep breath. Three, eyes open, wide-
awake, feeling fantastic, all the suggestions removed. That’s a very 
simple formula, and we can refine that later.   
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. But it’s consistency for me.  You don’t need to marry your 
wake up.  If I’m counting someone down, if I’m deepening, I count 
down.  If I’m counting someone out, I count up.  And when I say 
sleep, this will happen when I say, one, two wide-awake, this will 
happen. I tell you why, and so another poke in the eye for everyone 
who thinks hypnosis is social compliance.  In my first stage show, I 
had about 18 people on stage. They’d all done everything that I had 
wanted them to do to that point. And I said right, in a moment, I’m 
going to count to three. And on the count of three, you’ll all jump 
up.  You’ll believe your Eminem, the world’s biggest rap star.   
 
 
You’ll dance like him, rap like him. Anyone else who is dancing like 
Eminem, you will out Eminem them basically.  So it’s sort of a 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
128 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
battling Eminem’s.  One, two, wide-awake.  In came the music, 
nobody moved.  No one even opened an eye. No one raised an 
eyebrow.  No one stirred because I’d said when I say one, two, 
three.  Now, I’d expect if anyone was acting on stage, and they hear 
the music and one, two, wide-awake that they would bounce out of 
it.  I’ve got the video.  Nobody moves an inch. And I didn’t know 
why because at that point, I wasn’t consistent with my wake ups. So 
I had no idea that I’d made that mistake.   
 
 
I was literally get up.  Get up.  Get up. And I now have 18 blind 
Eminems on a raised stage, which is extremely dangerous.  But 
people take it literally. So things like the wake up, you’ll see how I 
do it in my book.  It’s pretty traditional. People have been doing it 
like that for a long time.  It ensures all the silly suggestions are 
gone.  It ensures I cover my ass with regard to having done my job.  
Everything is back to normal. You will feel this, you will feel that.  
And I dictate how they’re going to feel.  You’re going to feel like 
this, you’re going to feel like that.  I’m still going to stick around and 
give them the proper service as it were.  But I’m also going to ask 
them, how good do you feel?  Great.  When their friends ask them, 
I’d expect them to respond hypnotically, great.   
 
Igor: 
For a moment, I’ll just emphasize, don’t concern yourself too much 
about what’s in their wake up. We’ll give you a nice routine for that 
tomorrow.  Right now, we’re more interested in you getting the 
whole building the momentum, and at the end, just give them a 
very simple wake up, one to three, one to five, whatever you 
prefer. Just think to that as a routine, and we’ll elaborate on that as 
we go along. Sound good to you guys?  Okay.  
 
 
Create a Demo 
 
Igor: 
So can I have everyone standing on their feet, please? I’d like to go 
around the room.  I want you to point at things and alternate 
between what they are and what they are not.  Okay. Point at 
them, and point with conviction.  Once you get a little bit of flow 
going with that, I’ll get you to find a partner.

Go straight to the first person you see.  Make eye contact with 
them. What I want to do now is go through a full Street Hypnosis 
routine.  That is, you say “Hi, you look like you’re having some fun.” 
Remember the compliments, folks.  You keep forgetting these 
things, and this is very important.  Put it in there. Hi.  You like you’re 
a fun person.  I’m a hypnotist in performance.  You know the whole 
spiel by now.  Let me show you something cool. Come forward, 
would you?  You’re going to go through a full finger magnet. You’re 
going to go through the full hand magnets. At that point, you can 
take it in any direction that you want.  You can do an arm levitation, 
an emotional thing, a stiff arm, eyes locked, you can combine them 
all together.  
 
 
What I want to see is four or five different hypnotic demonstrations 
in a row.  Here’s one.  Here’s two.  Here is three.  Four, five, six, 
seven. 
 
Anthony: 
Even the wake up. Tell them how good they’re going to feel and 
wake them up. 
 
Igor: 
Right. So I want to have a momentum. The key here is you’re going 
to roll through these things without any pauses.  It doesn’t mean 
you speak faster, although you can speed it up when you get 
excited. The point is you’re not going to go one, two, your arms, 
now stiff and rigid, stiff and rigid.  Great.  Still stiff, still rigid.  Do you 
feel the pause, the awkwardness just happening at that point?  You 
don’t want any of that. So stiff and rigid, tested. Come on. Make it 
stronger.  You can do it. Try, try hard.  Look at it. What’s going on 
here? What’s happening here? And now, as I touch you, you’ll relax 
all the way down.  Relax all the way down.  You’re doing fantastic.  
 
 
Now, as I snap my fingers, you’ll open your eyes, and you’ll laugh or 
whatever it is.  Just build a momentum up. And if something occurs 
to you, like if you want to give something a go, don’t plan it. Go 
with it.  Does that make sense? Do not plan it.  Just go with it.  If 
you over plan it, you’ll over think it.

Anthony: 
If you’ve got their feet together, and you feel like it, give them the 
postural sway.  I don’t want anyone falling over. Be aware that 
people will fall over if you do this. 
 
Igor: 
Catch them. 
 
Anthony: 
Okay. Let’s not even get to that point. Tell them that you will not 
fall over, that you will feel yourself rocking backwards and 
forwards.  Another way you can cheat, do this on the drop back, 
you just put your feet together, just look up there. Look up at that 
light.  Another way you can do this, the same as with the pointy 
fingers on the hands, is you can just stand here.  You can talk to 
him, and you can just let go of him like that.  Just putting a little bit 
of pressure on there. As you talk to him, this arm just is forgotten 
about by everybody else, and then you say just close your eyes, and 
you let go, you’re on the deck of a ship.   
 
 
And you’re going to get that movement.  So again, if you need to 
cheat, it’s not cheating. 
 
Igor: 
So for the moment, guys, I don’t want you guys over thinking this.  I 
want you to go with your instincts.  Have a smooth introduction. 
That’s a very key, important thing. And then do four or five demos, 
roll one from the other. As soon as something happens, you go – 
let’s say the hand is coming.  I see a finger twitching, I go oh, finger 
twitching, okay.  Now, I want that finger to lift all the way up, all the 
way up, great.  That’s another demo off the back of the hand demo. 
So if you see something, just jump on it and roll with it. Don’t think 
too much about it.  Don’t over think it. We’ll get more strategic I 
promise you as we go along. Do you all understand the rules of the 
game for this next exercise? Yes?   
 
 
All right, guys.  Walk around the room, point at things, and alter 
between what they are and what they are not.

Handshake Induction 
 
Igor: 
You’re having far too much fun here.  Who enjoyed that?  Now, 
notice why do hands go up so much more quickly?  Now that you’re 
making your own stuff up, who feels more like a hypnotist now that 
they’re doing that?  Right?  You’re seeing stuff.  You’ve got some 
directions to flow in. Again, strategy will come out of that.  But 
you’ve got to trust your own unconscious.  You’re asking your 
clients or your subjects to trust their unconscious.  You’ve got to do 
the same thing.  And look how much easier it gets when you do 
that.  Would that be fair to say?  
 
 
When you over think, you go now, what’s the next step and what 
do I do and what am I doing wrong? That’s the wrong part of your 
mind doing the thinking.  Why don’t you just go oh, that’s 
interesting or let’s see what happens when we do this or when we 
do that.  That’s the right part of your mind that you’re trusting.  
Make sense to you guys?  There’s another part of your mind I want 
you to learn how to trust, another way of learning to trust. Could I 
have a volunteer here, please?  Anyone?  Put your hand up.  So 
your name is Benjamin, is that right?  Okay. Ben, look at the hand 
and look at the changing focus of your eyes. All the way down. 
That’s right. Deeper, deeper, deeper, that’s right.  
 
 
The hand all the way.  That’s it. Relaxing deeper and deeper.  And 
that hand goes up here.  It may as well just stay there because it 
was there already, and that made you feel good, didn’t it?  Isn’t this 
an interesting state to be in right now.  Now, do you feel that good 
feeling? As you feel that good feeling, you might find yourself really 
beginning to smile, and that hand became stuck only as quickly as 
you enjoy the sensation. That’s right.  Only as quickly as that gets 
stuck. And you’ve been trying to test that out, haven’t you?  You 
sneaky little person. I haven’t asked you to test it yet, and already 
it’s stuck.  What’s going on there?   
 
 
Stop testing and just enjoy yourself going all the way to relaxing the 
hand all the way off. Very good.  In a moment I’m going to shake 
your hand.  And when I shake your hand, you’ll open your eyes 
feeling fresh, alert, simply fantastic.  Maybe you’ll have some 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
132 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
memory of what happened. Who knows what’s going to happen.  
Let’s find out.  Here you go, Benjamin. Open your eyes up feeling 
refreshed, relax. Good job.  Give him a round of applause. Too 
quick?  Who wants to learn how to do that?  That’s the classic 
induction.  I think Richard Bandler pretty much invented it.  It’s kind 
of fun, and I mean, isn’t this dramatic?  At the end of doing 
something like this, you can go to someone and say hey, that’s a 
great job.  
 
 
And that’s a great way to finish a set, isn’t it?  Because people go 
my god, it’s like Darin Brown, it’s cool. But the irony is, this is 
actually easier than everything else you’ve done so far.  Wouldn’t 
you say? 
 
Anthony: 
I think it’s the easiest induction. 
 
Igor: 
So let’s do this step by step to really get used to this. The first thing 
we’ll do is don’t worry about the language or anything like that. Just 
get used to the mechanics, and then the language wraps on top of 
that, and it becomes very easy. Does that make sense? 
 
Anthony: 
I’ve never seen anyone do it you stick your hand in front, and – 
 
Igor: 
Yeah,  I sped it up. 
 
Anthony: 
Okay. 
 
Igor: 
That was a cheat. That was just because I felt like it at the time.  I 
did it wrong, oh my God.  I’m sorry, Anthony, can you forgive me?   
 
Now this is the most crucial part of the whole induction.  This is the 
bit that everyone gets wrong. But actually, it’s a make or break on 
it.  Right?  What is that?  That’s kind of faking kids in school. So he’s 
now on alert that something weird is going on. There is no pattern, 
there’s nothing. So if all you’re doing is going like – he’s going to 
know something is up.  It just takes a lot of the magic away from 
what you’re doing.  So the key thing really is getting people to 
shake their hand but not quite complete it. Doesn’t that feel weird? 
So what’s your name?  Benjamin?  
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
133 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Doesn’t that feel weird because you’re going for the hand, but it’s 
not quite there.  That’s what you’re looking for. The way to get 
good at this is very simple.  Go around and you guys stand up as 
well.  Go around and shake someone’s hand.  Just shake someone’s 
hand normally.  You’re just shaking people’s hands.  It’s all natural 
and so on.  You shake people’s hands. But one person, at some 
random point, you don’t even think about it, you just withdraw 
your hand and don’t complete the shake.  You just let it stay there.  
They’ll leave their hand there for you.  It’s a little game they’ll play 
for now.   
 
 
You’ll leave your hand here.  We’ll add stuff on top of that as we go 
along.  But this is the crucial part.   
 
Let me finish that shake so it doesn’t feel so weird.  It does feel odd, 
doesn’t it, Alex? So the key here to make it natural is not to try and 
not make contact.  It’s to make contact with enough people like a 
normal, natural handshake. At some point, your unconscious mind 
will tell you I don’t feel like it right now, and that feels odd, doesn’t 
it?  Now, the induction is just as simple as that. All the way. That’s 
it. There you go.  May as well get stuck there. Why not?  Enjoy that 
sensation.  But before we test, hands release, and you can come 
back out of trance.   
 
 
Hands releasing now, coming back out of trance.  Very good. Do 
you see how the hand didn’t want to release?  It’s that quick.  It was 
pretty impressive. For a guy who can’t go into hypnosis, what’s up 
with that? So walking around the room, just shake people’s hands 
and know that in the back of your mind that somehow some of 
these guys, you’re not going to shake their hands. But at some 
point, someone is not going to shake yours and it will be like whoa, 
what’s happening there?  And you just carry on shaking hands 
randomly. And the key is when you’re not shaking someone’s hand, 
you’re going to pull back slightly.  You’re going to go for the 
handshake and pull back slightly, but not each time.   
 
 
Is that easy to do?  Just spend a minute on that, and we’ll come 
back and add something on top of that.  Was that easy to do? So 
what did we do with this one?  Can I just borrow you?  Stand up. So 
now, you should be getting to the point quite easily – where you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
134 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
can quite easily not complete the handshake.  Now, notice this 
hand is right here.  Let me just make sure the camera sees it. So at 
this point, as soon as this hand starts pulling back, it’s like a see 
saw.  My other hand will come up because I don’t want him to go 
chasing after my hand, which will happen by the way.  So if he pulls 
his hand away from me, pull your hand away, a lot of people will go 
chasing the hand because they’re so fixed on completing the 
handshake, they have to follow.   
 
 
You want to prevent that. So as you pull your hand away, this hand 
is going to here, and it’s just going to lightly hold onto their wrist.  
Some people like it like this. Some people like it like this. Some 
people like to hold it this way.  I don’t care how you hold the hand.   
 
What I care about is that hand pulls away.  You’re going to prevent, 
push forward.  You’re going to get a little bit of counter resistance.  
This is interesting because that counter resistance is where the 
trance can very naturally come from. But we’re not looking at that 
point yet. All we’re looking for is you have that point, and all you’re 
going to do is lift that hand ever so slightly just so you know you’re 
in control of that arm now, and he knows that something really odd 
is happening.  
 
 
Does that makes sense? Easy to do? Off you go, guys, very quickly.   
 
So can I just borrow you? So you’re here, you’re at this point.  Now 
at this point here, just so you can all see, you come for the 
handshake, you’re just naturally withdrawn.  This hand wants to 
follow, but you have him by the wrist so it can’t quite go. The 
energy that wants to pursue the hand, just push it on up, so it’s up 
near his face somewhere.  At this point, just get really interested in 
his palm and go what’s this?  Just get interested in his palm. There’s 
lots of variations.  I ended up doing a cheat because I want to do it a 
little faster.  But the classic version is just look at his palm because 
what happens when you look?  
 
 
Where’s the attention going when your hand is being pulled away?  
He’s going to look at me to find out what’s going on?  What are you 
up to?  I don’t want the attention on me. I want his attention on – 
and you’ve got a little quizzical expression as well like what’s up 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
135 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
with that.  It gives them a non-verbal cue, like something odd is 
here.  Does that make sense?  Is that easy?  Great.  Off you go.   
 
So can I borrow you again?  So the mechanics are straightforward.  
It’s to here, it’s lifting, and then you have a choice.  I like this one 
because it’s faster, or we can just go from here and start tapping 
that hand as it gets close to the face. And when the eyes come, it’s 
closed.  Now, what about the language that follows this whole 
thing? Wouldn’t that be of interest?   
 
 
Well, here, you can say anything you want.  It’s like you’re returning 
to normal conversations.  So hi, my name is Igor.  Look.  And you 
want to have a dramatic pause at this point.  You’re looking at his 
palm, and you’re pointing, maybe even touching his palm. Why? 
Because you want to rest his attention on that palm.  Make sense?  
This becomes his focal point, and you’ll see that even though he 
knows what’s going on, look.  Isn’t it kind of hard to not look at your 
palm, even though you know what’s happening, right?  Why?  If I 
just go look, not quite as good.  If I just go look, it’s not as strong. 
Touch gets one set of attention.   
 
 
My own look does another one. My pausing after it, look – now, 
what’s going to happen at that point is they’re already confused 
enough about the hand not completing the handshake. And then 
they’ll go look, and they go what’s wrong? What’s happened? 
What’s going on here?  You want that because that sends the mind 
for a little freefall.  It’s little spinning wheels.  At that point, I mean, 
the language is very simple. The changing focus of your eyes.  You 
look as your eyes change focus, the changing focus of your eyes or 
whatever it is as that hand comes closer. The classic method is this 
hand now gets pushed towards them slightly. That’s right. The 
changing focus is the hand comes closer.  
 
 
And when touched to your face, you can go all the way down.  
That’s right. All the way. There you go.  
 
 As that hand just comes solidifying even closer to the face, finding 
its own place to stick tight.  Now, I’m building in to an effect that I 
wanted to.  Do you see how that works?  You can do it gently.  It’s 
not a big deal. Hand releases nice and free again coming back. Good 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
136 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
job, well done.  My preference is for the same thing, just I like it a 
little bit faster, and I’m going to be controlling the movement more. 
Since I’m here, I’m going look. As your eyes change focus all the 
way down and just relax all the way, all the way because then I have 
the relaxation here or his hand is still up here at that point as you 
relax all the way down.  But now, I have an instant hypnotic effect, 
don’t I? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. Everyone is pointing. 
 
Igor: 
If I’m standing at a bar, and I’m doing this, do you think I’m going to 
get attention?  I hadn’t done anything yet.  But this is pretty 
dramatic, isn’t it?  And now, I can go the hand can move to your 
face only as quickly as you begin to deepen that experience right 
now preparing yourself for a wonderful journey in hypnosis.  Now, 
the hand moves.  It’s like amazing stuff.  Crazy.  Now, the hand is 
moving pretty slowly.  I don’t like that.  So let’s try a little bit faster 
now.  There you go. Very good. Do you see how you can insist on 
some things?  I’m not forcing it, but I’m tapping it with a little bit 
more insistence to make it happen.   
 
 
And now, you can just roll into whatever other effects you wanted, 
whether it’s the hand stuck as you did before or whether you take 
the arm out, and you lock it out to one side. That’s it.  Nice and 
locked, make it strong, nice and strong. There you go.  Nice and 
strong. Do you see how it hasn’t moved yet?  And it will have the 
same effect, and releasing all the way down.  That’s right. Do you 
see how natural it is to move from that into the other things?  It 
looks spectacular, but actually, it’s one of the easiest things you’ll 
ever do.  Do you understand that?  Do you want to hear the 
language again?  Bring yourself back all the way. That’s right.   
 
 
Well done.  It’s kind of trippy, isn’t it?  So thank you for being my 
subject.  Oh no, look, at the changing focus as you close your eyes.  
If I’m doing this, I’m going to tell them what to do. Close your eyes.  
Hands coming towards your eyes is going to get eye closure 
anyway. As you close your eyes, and I like to do a little jerk here, 
just a little shoulder shake, as you go all the way down. That’s right.  
Let go, all the way. And this hand, that’s right, can remain there 
only as long as something interesting can happen.  Now, at this 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
137 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
point, I might say as you go deeper and deeper, you might find that 
interesting things begin to occur as your mind takes on a role of its 
own.  Just follow as you go deeper and deeper. That’s right.   
 
 
And as you now go down on one knee, that’s it. Bending on one 
knee, that’s right. All the way up to the front. And as you go deeper 
and enjoy that position, you’ll find your mind drifting on a 
wonderful holiday to a fantastic place. Enjoy that experience.  Enjoy 
the experience of just drifting through your own powerful 
imagination like a free holiday.  Is this going to be the crowd’s 
attention on the street, in a pub, something like that?  That was 
easy to get, wasn’t it? And he’s enjoying it. And by the way, you can 
happily walk away at this point, and they’ll just come back, and 
what the hell just happened?  Or you can leave them there, and you 
can put someone else next to them.   
 
 
I think it’s called sculpturing or stating, human sculpture or 
something.  All kinds of different ways of doing it.  But this is a very 
benign way of doing it.  I know some people do it just first thing 
without even talking to people, just land them in trance and do this.  
I don’t kind of like that as much. That’s right. Come on back. Good 
job.  How was that?  Come to your feet.  Good job. Well done. Did 
you enjoy that? 
 
Audience Member: I think so. 
 
Igor: 
You didn’t expect that to happen, did you? 
 
Audience Member: No. 
 
Igor: 
But do you see how after a while he just went where am I?  But let 
me ask you, did it feel quite natural whilst you were in that position 
before? 
 
Audience Member: If felt nice, yeah. 
 
Igor: 
But it wasn’t until you came back, and you found yourself kind of 
there going like what am I – this is odd. Why am I doing this?  And 
this is a really nice contrast between the normal waking state and 
the trance state.  You don’t have to do it every time, but do you see 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
138 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
how many places you can go with this?  Does that make sense to 
you guys?  And all you’re saying is basically look, changing focus, 
close eyes. And if you want them to go to sleep, then you just want 
to put sleep. Or as you look, changing focus as you sleep now.  And 
then come on back all the way. I’m going to use you later.   
 
Anthony: 
I’m just going to add a few points to this because this is the 
induction I use more than any other. Ben, come up here.  It would 
be a shame not to hypnotize you as our paths crossed on the 
forum.  What Igor has just showed you there is, I mean, this is rapid 
induction, but this is a super trimmed, slimmed down version of it. 
So I’m going to give you a couple of extra lines so you can perhaps 
slow it down if that’s the way you want to do it.  This is very 
effective. But I’m not a big fan of putting hands in people’s faces 
like that because it can be misinterpreted by who is watching.  And 
if they half see it, that’s the only bit they see. Their boyfriend walks 
back from the bar, and that’s what they see.  
 
 
Actually, it can cause problems, but it is very effective because it’s 
completely overpowering if you time it well with your suggestions. 
So the situation I’d normally be in, your feet would be together.  If 
you put your feet together. All right.  We’ll have done magnetic 
fingers, and we’ll be doing magnetic hands with the eyes closed. 
And the way I’m going to teach you this just to give you kind of two 
inductions with one.  One of which will be permissive, and one of 
which will be this classic interrupt, if you like. So you have magnets 
on the palms of your hands, Ben. They’re being pulled closer and 
closer together. They’re already starting to move.  You can feel 
them getting closer and closer.   
 
 
Some people will actually feel that real or imagined force 
developing between them. If you can feel that, nod your head for 
me. Fingers moving, hands twitching, that’s right, when they touch.  
Just relax and sleep. Go inside, deeper, deeper down.  From this 
moment forward, when I say the word one, two, wide awake, your 
eyes will open.  You’ll be ready to respond to the suggestion you’ve 
been given. And in a moment when I say that, your eyes will open, 
and you’ll be ready to be hypnotized.  Nod your head if you 
understand.  That’s right.  One, two, wide-awake. Excellent. That 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
139 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
was great.  Now, just look up at your hand.  Look at the lines on it. 
Look at one spot.  
 
 
As the hand moves towards your face, your eyes are going to begin 
to change focus. And as you become aware of your eyes, Ben, close 
your eyes and sleep and relax. Go deeper, deeper down now, 
sinking, floating, drifting down.  This arm can relax, completely relax 
this arm, this arm can relax, completely relax.  You’re doing 
wonderfully.  Your head like a bowling ball, it’s going to get heavier 
and heavier.  Your neck will relax completely, your spine will relax.  
You’re going to feel your head being pulled down toward the 
ground.  You won’t hurt yourself, but you’ll feel it getting heavier 
and heavier and heavier.   
 
 
There’s very little you can do about that.  Now, one, two, wide-
awake, feeling refreshed and relaxed now.  So let me just teach you 
this induction.  Let’s say I was going to do it – we’re talking about 
finding a moment and not doing the Peter Crouch dodgy sort of 
handshake.  It’s a handshake. He’s just succeeded at this and this.  
So for me, this is why it’s such a perfect induction if you’re going to 
use those exercises.  You can just say excellent or if your name is 
Bob Cobb, good job. But you can just put your hand out in front of 
you.  You can just say excellent, well done.  They think it’s over. 
They think your demo is over. So you stick your hand out, and you 
just grab hold of it.   
 
 
Now, I know Igor said that it’s not important to him how you touch 
it.  It’s fine because you can do it any way you want. To be honest, it 
doesn’t matter if you have the handshake on.  You can still get into 
it.  But for me, again, I want to get as much information as I can.  So 
I’m going to say well done, and I’m going to take hold of the wrist. 
And if you know my book, in the inductions, nearly all of them 
involve an arm and catalepsy. And in nearly every induction, I hold 
their wrists like this as quick as I can. And lots of you are grabbing 
hold of their wrists.  It’s the same thing.  You can feel anything like 
that, and the same way you can rock your shoulders, you can relax, 
you can’t feel anything.   
 
 
If I do that, I can feel it.  So if I hold his wrist like this, I can feel it.  
Now, if his arm weighs a ton, which it doesn’t right now, but if it

gets heavier and heavier, and it’s loose, just give me your arm.  Let 
it be loose and limp like a ragdoll’s arm. And that’s what’s 
happening, then I know that’s the way I’ve got to go.  I know I can 
say that’s right. Loose, limp, and relax, when I let go of it, your eyes 
are closed, you’ll go into hypnosis.  But what I want to do is I want 
to take hold of his arm, his wrist like this, and I want to do the 
minimum. But I’m just going to move it, a little tap to the side, a 
little tap upwards. And immediately, I can tell it’s getting kind of 
weightless, and he’s taking the weight.  
 
 
Do exactly what Igor said. So hi, how are you doing?  Look here.  
Look at your hand. And for me, it’s the zoning in. So I’m going to say 
look at your hand, look at the lines on it, look at one spot. That’s 
how I’m going to get him to go and focus in.  Look at your hand, 
look at the lines on it, look at one spot.  And then it’s just pacing 
and leading.  We are going to get into this language a lot more. But 
this is how I’m going to phrase it.  Every single time, it’s going to be 
the same.  As that hand moves towards your face, and I know it’s 
going to move toward his face because I’m going to push it towards 
his face. But I want to do the minimum amount of pushing.  
 
 
So I want to say as the hand move towards your face, now I can feel 
it starting to go now. So I know now that I could let go, and I could 
do that.  And he’s going to still kind of behave like I’ve got hold of 
his wrist. So as the hand moves towards your face up here, as the 
hand moves toward your face, that is a statement of fact, your eyes 
will begin to change focus. That is also a statement of fact.  But 
you’ll notice it’s still set in the future. I’m not saying they’re getting 
sleepy, they’re getting heavy, they’re getting tired.  I know that 
from between there and there, his eyes are going to change focus.   
 
 
So for me, it’s just hi, how are you doing? Look up at your hand, 
look at the lines on it, look at one spot.  Three instructions.  As the 
hand moves towards your face, your eyes will begin to change 
focus. And as you become aware of your eyes, close your eyes, and 
sleep and relax. Go deeper, deeper down.  Now, sinking, floating, 
drifting down to sleep.  Let go.  You can be aware of what I’m saying 
to you.  You can be aware of your surroundings.  You’re safe, well, 
and protected. Every single muscle, nerve, and fiber relaxing now.  
You have nothing to do for a time.  In a moment, I’m going to – and 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
141 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
I’m just going to get straight back into the routines we’ve already 
showed you.   
 
 
So I’m going to count to five, and you’ll be back in the room wide-
awake and alert, everything back to normal. So one, feeling 
wonderful. Two, to achieve all the things you want to achieve, Ben. 
And three, for the force of that freedom coming through you. Four, 
take a deep breath. Fill your chest up with energy giving oxygen. 
And five, eyes open and wide awake.  Good man.  Quick recap.  You 
can get into it like this.  Look at your hand, look at the lines, look at 
one spot. Three things.  As it moves towards your face, your eyes 
will begin to change focus.  You become aware of your eyes. So as 
that moves, as this is going to happen, as you become aware of 
them, which is kind of nothing, very definite, change gear, close 
your eyes, bang, sleep.  
 
 
So that’s one way of doing it. The reason I’m showing you this way 
is because, these are just the first two inductions that I always 
teach. The other one is called eye to hand fixation or hand to eye 
fixation.  One of the biggest reasons that I find people don’t use this 
handshake interrupt is because of the interrupt. They think well, it’s 
timing, and it’s difficult, and what if they just say get off, which 
generally does not happen if you do it with a decent timing. But 
let’s say he’s just done magnetic hands, and I’m feeling a bit more 
permissive that day.  His hands are getting closer, his eyes are shut, 
and when they touch, just let your hands drift down and relax.  
 
 
Take a deep breath in, and just breathe out.  Open your eyes.  You 
did brilliantly.  Are you left handed or right handed?   
 
Audience Member: Right. 
 
Anthony: 
Can I borrow your arm?  Thank you. Look at your hand.  Look at the 
lines on it, look at one spot.  As the hand moves towards your face, 
your eyes will begin to change focus.  You become aware of them. 
Now, close your eyes and sleep and relax.  Go deeper, deeper down 
now.  Sinking and floating and drifting to sleep, deeper sleep. 
Everything I say to you now will become your reality however 
stupid or silly it seems.  Everything I say to you will instantly and 
immediately become your reality.  Nod your head when that’s 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
142 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
understood.  Deeper and deeper to sleep now. One, two, three, 
four, five, wide awake.  
 
 
So the only difference is that instead of doing a funny little 
handshake interrupt, now I’m going to just say are you left handed 
or right handed? This is the witch doctor effect.  I’m the expert.  I 
must be asking that question for a good reason.  I’m not actually 
because I don’t care which hand he is.  I don’t care which hand I 
use.  But are you left handed or right handed?   
 
Audience Member: Right. 
 
Anthony: 
Can I just borrow that arm? When I want to use an arm or a hand or 
a finger, I will generally say that arm, can I borrow it?  Can you give 
that to me?  Like it’s an object because it is.  It’s a prop.  Can I 
borrow that arm? And I’m back in this position again.  I’ve got my 
sensitivity.  He’s there already.  He’s already taken the weight. I’m 
confident I can talk it in.  So it’s exactly the same words, exactly the 
same induction, except it’s permissive.  Can I borrow that arm? 
Yeah. Thank you. Good. And just get in to it that way. So they’re the 
two you’ll see me using on the street over and over.  I can do 1,000 
inductions.  I don’t.  I do two.  Those two.  There you go. 
 
Igor: 
All right.  Let’s have one quick question, and we’ll start actually 
doing this stuff. Give him a round of applause.   
 
Audience Member: The question I have on this one is do you have to have used the 
magnetic hands before or would you walk straight up to them and 
do that, the witch doctor one? 
 
Anthony: 
The witch doctor bit is just me asking a question and expecting him 
to decide well, there must be some meaning for me asking that 
question.  The thing about the handshake is that lots of would be, 
wannabe, or being hypnotists have this mild obsession with just 
walking up to people unannounced, not telling them you’re a 
hypnotist, not asking for permission, slapping straight into a 
handshake induction and getting into it. I’ve done that.  But I don’t 
make a habit of it.  I kind of think I only did it to see if I could do it.  
There is no good reason, really, not to ask someone’s permission 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
143 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
unless you’re in a bit of a tight spot, and you need to hypnotize 
someone to get out of that spot.  
 
 
Personally, you don’t need magnetic fingers or magnetic hands, but 
I would generally use it.  You could just say are you ready to be 
hypnotized?  Okay.  I’m a hypnotist.  Are you ready to be 
hypnotized?  You’ve got five people.  So right.  I’m going to come up 
to each of you in turn, and I’m going to hypnotize you. Look at your 
hand, bang.  Your hand, bang.  Of course you can.  As much as we’re 
teaching you this in a very modular, sequential fashion, every bit of 
the sequence, every module of the sequence can be disposed of.  
You can just walk up to people and say sleep.  It’s just that this is 
going to improve the amount of people you engage, and it’s going 
to improve your success rate once they are engaged.  That’s all it is.  
Nothing sinister.   
 
Igor: 
You can do any piece in any order you want.  Let me just emphasize 
this because Anthony’s been saying this, and hopefully maybe if I 
just repeat what he says it will help.  You can do anything you want 
in any order you want.  You can walk up to someone and say why is 
that foot stuck to the floor, sticking tightly now.  No matter how 
hard you try – you can do that.  Now, will it work? For some people 
yes, some people, no.   
 
Anthony: 
Test it -  
 
Igor: 
- if you should want it.  The point is if you now go through a 
sequence, the sequence guarantees, or shall we say improves the 
odds, and the next set of the sequence will work better and better 
and better, which means you gather more people into your success 
realm. 
 
Anthony: 
And the sequence is your performance. The point is just how far 
you can take it. 
 
Igor: 
It gets exciting.  It’s interesting.  It’s fun. So if you want to start with 
just the induction straight off.  Let me show you some cool things 
about how the mind works.  Sleep, all the way down, hands up 
here, strong – fine. Do it that way.  You can do the induction up 
here, sleep, all the way down, hands up, up, three, look at the lines, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
144 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
coming together, good.  Hands out, coming together this way. The 
sequence is irrelevant. What matters is that if you want the success 
rate to go up, this is one way of doing it. And in time, you’ll 
experiment, you’ll find your own ways of doing it, and you’ll go oh, 
those two schmucks didn’t know anything.  This is the way to do it, 
and that’ll be right because it will be your way of doing it.  
 
 
Right now, we want to give you some simple, clear guidance 
because in a half an hour, we’re going on the streets again, and 
you’ll be doing this with people.  And it’s nice to have a sequence 
because then you’ll know where to go with it. Does that make 
sense?  If you break sequence half way through, I’m not going to go 
stop, stop, what are you doing?  
 
Anthony: 
And if you had that feeling to do that, then I would suggest you go 
with it.  If you suddenly think I think I can just tap them on the head 
and they’ll go, I’m just trying to say, this is not new.  An 85-year-old 
magician emailed me a few weeks ago saying I saw Ralph Slater 
performing in Charlesbury Avenue in 1948 doing the handshake 
induction.  It’s been around for a long time.  There are variations.  I 
use two or three variations.  Igor has shown me a couple I’ve never 
seen.  The point is you’re just trying to get to that base camp of 
now I’m here. What’s next? And what’s next is the stuff we’ve 
already practiced. 
 
Igor: 
Don’t get too hung up about oh, which is he magic induction or the 
magic words? Those things will come. Yes, they’re things that will 
improve your odds. But really, your best thing is to go out there and 
do it.  If something might work better if you said it, but by thinking 
about it so much, you ruin the rest of the show, don’t do it.  Don’t 
do it until it comes natural.  I think we’ve talked enough. I think it’s 
time for you guys to do something.  
 
Anthony: 
Just say the worst piece of advice I was ever given was find the 
induction, fit it to your client. That’s now how I work.  I have a 
induction, I make it fit.  At this stage, that’s what I’d suggest. 
 
Igor: 
So everyone stand up, please.  Let’s do this a little differently, let’s 
play this game everyone.  Just do this with your hands, do that, 
then do this again, then clap.  Just do this a few times like that with 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

a partner before we start off.  Now, I’m going to do a little word 
association game. The word association is I’m going to say 
something like apple, apple, you have to say something else.  
 
Audience Member: Pear. 
 
Igor: 
Tree. 
 
Audience Member: Fruit. 
 
Igor: 
Always doing the clap.  So I say color. 
 
Audience Member: Red. 
 
Igor: 
Berry. 
 
Audience Member: Pink. 
 
Igor: 
Shoes. 
 
Audience Member: Sausages. 
 
Igor: 
Dress. 
 
Audience Member: Coat. 
 
Igor: 
Okay. Great. So we’re just going to start playing that. The point is 
that you’re not going to be able to think too much of what’s going 
on. We’ll play that for a few times, once I get a sense that the 
energy is up in the air. Whoever you’re with will be your partner, go 
straight into your routine, which means you’ll turn around and go 
hey, you look like you’re having fun.  Come this way. I’m a 
hypnotist.  I’m here performing.  You’re into your set.  Whether the 
set is this, this, and other stuff, or a set is this, this, I don’t care. 
What I want to see you is rolling through five different effects. 
That’s easy to do, right? That’s one, that’s two, that’s three, that’s 
four, that’s five, that’s six, that’s seven. Whatever.  This is eight.   
 
 
I want to have one of those effects at least be one of the 
suggestibility tests.  I want one of those effects at least to be one 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
146 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
form of the handshake induction, whether it’s the ones he’s 
showed you, the one I showed you, or something you want to make 
up.  I don’t care. But I want to have one form in there just for 
mixing and variety.  And that’s it. Five or six effects rolling off each 
other in whatever role you want to do them in.  Just follow your 
instincts in that way.  If you don’t have any instincts, just follow 
those routines we set out for you.  It doesn’t really matter.  Is that 
easy to do, folks?   
 
 
So find a partner and start clapping, and when you hear me shout 
go, then just go straight into your induction.   
 
 
Health & Safety 
 
Igor: 
We’re pushing you a little bit probably because we want you to get 
a lot of experience before we go back out on the streets.  It should 
be a little easier tonight because people will be more relaxed, more 
at ease. They’ll be moving less. They’ll be standing more.  We’ll be 
hanging around outside of bars. We’re not going to go inside of the 
bars as much. But when people spill outside, those are the areas 
that will be easy to work because it’s stationary now.  It’s a little 
easier to approach.  
 
 
Before we do that, though, we want to talk a few important points 
that’s going to be important, especially in the bar scene where 
there’s alcohol involved, when there’s this bouncer involved looking 
after people’s safety, and so on, to keep you safe, to keep the other 
people safe.  It’s just part of the social contract that we’re engaging 
in. Do you want to take over a little bit for that? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah.  First off, let me say this.  If you want to go out there and do 
this, you are solely responsible for the health and safety, morals, 
ethics, boundaries. I’m not, unless I’m doing the hypnosis. Igor’s 
not, because he’s running the course. 
 
Igor: 
I never am. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
147 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Anthony: 
But this is serious stuff, especially in the UK.  You are responsible for 
this. You are responsible if that person falls over.  You are 
responsible if their boyfriend doesn’t like it and decides to hit you.  
You’re responsible if the bar owner gets annoyed.  You’re 
responsible if they have an abreaction and go insane for the rest of 
their life, which is very unlikely. But you’re responsible. 
 
Igor: 
Just put a frame around this, these are the worst possible case 
scenarios.  We don’t anticipate any of this happening. But the key 
here is you’re the hypnotist. You’re in charge. So do good work here 
guys.  Be respectful of the people you’re working with.  
 
Anthony: 
First off, just take that responsibility on board.  If you’re going to 
hypnotize someone, you’re responsible for their well being, 
absolutely and entirely.  The first – I’m going to go through some 
health and safety stuff. And firstly, this is going to apply to you, your 
health and safety. The biggest danger to you out there is somebody 
else getting annoyed. And let me tell you, some people don’t like 
hypnosis.  Some people don’t like their friends being hypnotized. 
Some people have religious convictions that mean they think it’s 
wrong and evil and the devil’s work. There are different reasons, 
but they’re their reasons.  
 
 
And your job is not to try to talk people around and justify them 
and say it’s got nothing to do with you, blah, blah, blah, because 
you’re going to end up in some trouble. So if you’re in that situation 
and someone is objecting, then even if I’m half way through things, 
I will just say that’s fine.  We’re just going to bring this to an end.  
I’ll wake them up properly.  I’m going to count to five, and you’ll be 
wide-awake.  Thanks, you did great.  I mean, your friend didn’t want 
to continue, so I’d still put it back onto their friend. But if someone 
is objecting, that’s fine.   
 
Igor: 
Just note the politeness he’s doing that with. Remember, we talked 
about if people say are you interested in hypnosis and go no, and 
you say very politely and full of positive energy. Thanks a lot.  Have 
a great night.  He’s doing the same thing.  We brought it to an end. I 
hope you have a great night.  No hard feelings. Your friend didn’t 
like it, and that’s fine.  Have a great night, guys. Thank you for 
playing. Off you go.  It still means you can leave with your self-

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
148 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
esteem intact. There’s no loss of status. There’s no loss of face.  
They have a good time, you have a good time. There’s no war, it’s 
just peace. Everyone loves each other. 
 
Anthony: 
But let’s say you’re really willing, and your suggestions are landing 
and suddenly the hypno show on the street is happening and 
someone is objecting.  You’ve got to get your ego out of the way 
and bring it to an end.  That’s just how it is.  You’ll have friends who 
can’t resist poking them in the ribs.  Don’t be silly, don’t be stupid.  
They’re fine, I normally just hold my hand up like, this is semi 
serious kind of thing. I wouldn’t say it, but almost to say just give 
her a chance, just give her a moment.  So you kind of deal with 
those people. They’re not necessarily objecting. They just don’t 
believe it.   
 
 
I mean, that’s how Bray discovered it anyway was going up on stage 
and trying to wake someone up, and they didn’t respond.  So firstly, 
just look after yourself and be aware of your surroundings. I’ve 
been out with Emmett who trained with me, and he’s now out 
there doing this regularly.  He mixes it up with his magic.  He goes 
out in the street just doing hypnosis.  We’d have one moment 
where the guy, we’re outside a bar, and he told us he was a cage 
fighter, and he was such and such champion. And it was like okay.  
I’m interesting in fighting, and we had a conversation. But he said 
he didn’t like hypnosis.  
 
Ten minutes later, he went around the corner, Emmett’s got his 
girlfriend and his sister. He’s doing a double, triple handshake kind 
of heading towards a hypno orgasm. And this guy was just standing 
there steam coming off of him.  I was like Emmett, bring it to an 
end, mate. And he carried on, and in the end, I just said Emmett, 
stop.  The police are here, whatever, just to bring it to an end.  The 
point is that could have turned nasty.   
 
I’ll give you a few other scare stories, and these are all true. A book 
I read on Stage Hypnosis, some of you will have read it, and there 
was an anecdote about Stage Hypnosis, he said to the guy, you’ve 
got a little fairy on your hand.  They’re really precious to you, and 
he slaps the guys hand, and he’s now got a broken nose because 
why wouldn’t he have?  He’s just squashed the guy’s favorite fairy – 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Igor: 
I guess what we’re saying here in terms is just keep it respectful of 
the person in front of you.  Give them a pleasant experience.  
You’re going to squash their favorite person? Is that a pleasant 
experience?  No.  If you have someone’s boyfriend there, and 
you’re inducing his girlfriend, and he’s getting all jealous, is that a 
pleasant experience for all the people involved in your show?  No.  
Keep it a pleasant experience, and if you can’t keep it a pleasant 
experience, say thank you very much. Find someone else you can 
make a pleasant experience with. And all these things won’t 
necessarily happen.   
 
Anthony: 
And most of the comedy guys, the easiest place for this to go is into 
the gutter. And that’s what most stage hypnotists are doing, and 
they’re complaining about Street Hypnotists and anybody else 
involved. Again, I appreciate that there is a market for Roy Chubby 
Brown. There is a market for Jim Davidson.  There’s a market for 
Jimmy Karr. There’s a market for Steven Fry.   
 
Igor: 
For the Americans amongst you, these are all kind of blue, cursing – 
 
Anthony: 
Racist, misogynist.  Yeah.  You’re there.  It’s funny. But you walk 
away, is that the gag you want to tell yourself?  So you’ve kind of 
got a high brow and a low brow.  You’ve got a gutter, and you can 
do there.  You can have the person stripping off, shagging their 
chair, generally making a complete fool of themselves but 
degrading themselves. That’s not my show. That’s not what I do on 
the street. I don’t want to go there. And if you go there, I’m going 
to tell you about someone I trained a good year ago. They’d been 
trying to get into hypnosis for a year and not got beyond magnetic 
hands.  We went out, had a couple of failures, he got one.  He 
milked it.   
 
 
He did the whole routine. The last routine he did is I’m going to 
touch you on the nose, and you’re going to have an orgasm.  He is 
now known as Mr. Nosegasm.  He cannot shake that off. That’s him. 
And all I’m saying is that’s what you’ll be remembered for it that’s 
where you take it, into the gutter. So first off, yes, you can have fun. 
And you’ll hear some silly and ridiculous things. Take it in the spirit 
it’s intended.  But I’m not going to ask you to do this, do that, do 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
150 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
that, and get rid of their fears. That’s going to take care of your pre-
talk.  Someone objects – 
 
Igor: 
And stick to your promises.  If you promise you’re not going to 
embarrass someone, don’t break your promise afterwards. That’s 
just not a good thing to do, right?  So if you know you’re going to be 
going more risqué, which I don’t necessarily advise, but then find 
the right audience.  Find the appropriate environment for it. Get 
consent up front, then there’s no problems.  Do you see where 
we’re going with this? 
 
Anthony: 
So that’s a bit about you and just being aware of your surroundings, 
being aware for each other, being aware of who is – listening out. 
What’s occurring on the sidelines here.  The next thing because 
we’re going to be out or around bars is permission. I’m not saying 
you have to go up to the bar owner or manager and ask their 
permission to hypnotize someone because to me, if you want to do 
Street Hypnosis legally in the UK, the moment you start making it 
an entertainment to which the public are admitted, it does become 
a little bit challenging. For me, this is my basic human right to speak 
to people and have one to one interactions with people.  Sure, if 
other people find it entertaining, great.  
 
 
But I’m not selling tickets. I’m not charging.  I am giving that person 
an experience.  That’s how I frame it. That’s why I believe that I can 
do this legally.   
 
Igor: 
It makes your life a lot easier if – what Anthony is saying, which is 
you’re framing it very simply as I’m showing people some 
experiences about the power of their own minds, about self 
hypnosis. Then you’re going all out of the entertainment industry, 
you’re going out of the whole I’m doing this for money business. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s a different ball game. And the way Kev, who I work with, who 
you’ll work with tomorrow and Sunday put it, if I can juggle when 
I’m in a pub, and there’s a basket of oranges there, and someone 
says really, you can juggle? Show me some juggling, and I juggle 
three or five oranges, and other people look, is that an 
entertainment to which the public are admitted?  Not really.  It’s 
me juggling, and some people are watching and finding it amusing.

If I come in on horseback with some flaming batons and a troop of 
20 jugglers, then that’s an entertainment. So yes, we are aiming to 
be entertaining.  Yes, you’re going to have a performance mind set.  
 
 
But when we’re out there, understand this is an interaction 
between you and one other person.  And you’re giving them an 
experience based on words. And if you do that, and you present it 
that way, then you’re going to find, should it happen, it’s very 
unlikely to because no one has ever ended up in court over this, 
should that occur, then you can know that you’ll be walking out of 
there in five minutes time because there are certain things that 
they’ll have to prove that they’ll never be able to prove. But I’m just 
telling you, that’s how I frame it, and that’s how I justify what I’m 
doing.  It’s definitely not illegal because it’s just a one to one 
interaction.  One guy has written to his MP, and he’s said it’s 
busking but not for money.   
 
 
It’s unregulated in that sense.  In Covent Garden, it’s one particular 
spot in London. There are others, but more than any other, Covent 
Garden Square itself is massively, highly regulated with regard to 
public performance.  So, you know, it’s one place where arguments 
like I’m not performing, I’m not putting on any entertainment, I’m 
not asking for money might be shut down pretty quickly just 
because people pay and go through different hoops to get their 
spot in Covent Garden. They don’t want the hypnotists taking away 
20 people.  Right in the square, that’s not the best place to go.  I 
know we’re running on, but we’ve got to say this before we go out.   
 
 
A few other bits of health and safety.  We’ve mentioned drinking, 
and I can’t remember who it was that asked me earlier on are they 
going to be any good?  They’re drinking.  Now, the fact is there is 
perhaps a tipping point, but as far as I’m concerned, a couple of 
pints, a couple of glasses of wine, a few drinks is certainly not going 
to detract from someone’s hypnotizability.  I don’t believe that at 
all. The only reason I say on stage that I don’t want people who’ve 
been drinking heavily is because they tend to come up and behave 
like a cock and think they are the show. 
 
Igor: 
That’s a technical term, everyone.

Anthony: 
If you’re an American, no, it’s the same. But they do because they 
want to show off, and they can’t let go of that.  I’m going to give 
them an opportunity to show off, but they miss that point.  So if 
they’re really, really drunk, they can be sick. They can fall over. They 
can cause you a problem. That’s why I don’t have people on stage, 
but I’ve hypnotized people who are smashed on booze.  I’ve 
hypnotized people off their face on other drugs. They still get 
hypnotized. They still do everything. So I’m not seeking drunken 
people because they need to be able to pay attention at least. But 
it’s not even a consequence if people are standing there drinking.  
 
 
I’ll say do you mind putting your drink down. So the next thing you 
need to think about is glass.  If you’re going to have someone being 
hypnotized, you have to be aware that they might fall over. Some 
people when you say sleep, very, very, very few, just go down and 
just collapse. Sleep and stand, your legs will support you.  You will 
not fall over if that’s what you’re going to do.  If you think it’s a 
problem, sit them down.  If there’s glasses around, the kinds of 
routines we’re going to get into tomorrow anyway that some of you 
have already kind of been there are going to involve movement. 
Let’s have them dancing.  Let’s have them moving.   
 
 
Let’s have them protesting. Let’s have them shouting.  Let’s have 
them being vocal.  If you’re going to do that, then be aware that 
there are glasses around. Be aware that the girl next to it doesn’t 
necessarily want that red wine down her dress if someone starts – 
so this is in your control. This is not oh, it’s an accident. Sorry. I 
hypnotized him, and he started to – now, I didn’t know he was 
going to do that.  You’re the boss.  You’re in control, so you made 
that happen.  You’re going to have to clean it up.  You’re going to 
have to take care of that. So be aware of glass.  Be aware of curbs. 
Be aware of high heels.   
 
 
All these things, you’re in control.  If I’m on stage, I’ll say you will 
not step over that piece of tape.  If I’m on the street, I will say you 
will not run away, I will say you will not fall over.  I had a girl in 
Dublin the other day on a space hopper.  It was amazing. She was 
bouncing all over the place in a crouched position. It was ridiculous.  
It was difficult to do on an invisible space hopper.  You will not fall 
over or take care of that.  You’ll find it’s disgusting, you won’t 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

actually be sick. We’ll stop people puking up in your hypnotherapy 
practice if you use aversion.  You will get angry.  I often make 
people angry.   
 
 
You’re a librarian.  Anyone who laughs, she can really be insistent 
that they’re quiet.  You can be furious about this, and off you go.  
You’ve got Turret syndrome, but you will not be violent. So they’ll 
be ranting in someone’s face, but I know absolutely they’re not 
going to be violent. So you have to keep your eye on them if you’re 
going to have people moving around.  You have to be aware of 
everything else around you. There is this act, as I said, the 
Hypnotism Act. There are guidelines in that act that even though 
the act doesn’t really apply to us because they can’t license the 
street, the guidelines are sound.  The guidelines were put together 
by 27 Stage Hypnotists.  
 
 
There have been something like 29 incidents in the last 25 years, 27 
of them involved someone falling over and twisting their ankle. So 
they’re the kind of things that are going to bring this to an end very, 
very quick. So if you can have someone moving around, open your 
eyes.  Open your eyes, you’re not a blind Eminem as I had.  You 
should, if you can get it out, you should stick to those guidelines, 
which are not to work with people who are under 18. That’s going 
to cause you problems. So if you’re getting as old as I am, and you 
can’t tell anymore, then you’re going to have to ask the question. 
You can’t assume because they’ve got their drink in their hand 
they’re over 18.   
 
 
You should not be working with people who have a heart condition.  
You should not be working with people who are epileptic.  You 
should not be working with people who are on strong, psychoactive 
drugs.  
 
Igor: 
Or pregnant people, if they fall over, that’s double trouble. 
 
Anthony: 
My personal view, but don’t take it as a given, it’s just my 
experience, is that that person is no more likely to have an epileptic 
fit or seizure or any other kind of issue, whether in the hair dressers 
or in the hypnotists.  It doesn’t make any difference.   However, the 
person has a fit as they come out the hair dressers, they don’t 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
154 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
blame the hair dresser.  They come out having one when they’ve 
just been hypnotized, that’s who they’re going to blame.  So look, 
hands up.  I don’t ask every question every time.  Sometimes I make 
a kind of common sense judgment on it.  But they are the 
guidelines. And ideally, if you’re going to say it, you could say I’ve 
got to ask this question.   
 
 
Before we begin, are you all over 18? None of you are seriously 
asthmatic, epileptic, pregnant, serious back condition, and you all 
are mentally sound?  You’re not on any kind of seriously strong 
drugs? Is that cool? They’ll take it almost as a joke, but it shows that 
you care. And if you say those things, again, should it get to that 
point, you’re not going to be charged under the Hypnotism Act.  
You’ll be charged under negligence.  You’ll be charged under a 
public order offense.  There’s a difference, and the police can pin 
that on you or whatever.   
 
Igor: 
Just make sure that we don’t get charged with anything. 
 
Anthony: 
And it’s never happened.  I’ve taken hundreds of people out on the 
streets. They get results.  We go home, everyone is happy. 
 
Igor: 
So really to sum this up as a rule of thumb to keep inside your mind 
and really, it shouldn’t be rocket science at this point, which is treat 
people with respect.  Hypnosis won’t get people to defy the laws of 
physics. So things like curb sides, cracking your head on that, will 
hurt just as much with hypnosis as out of it.  It will do just as much 
damage.  High heels, balance is much harder on a tiny point than on 
a flat surface. Glass will go through flesh just as easily if it’s 
hypnotized flesh or not.  So these are things that in a normal – if 
you were at a party with someone, you’d be looking out for them, 
right?   
 
 
If you wanted to show someone a cool trick or a cool dance, you’ll 
say well, take your shoes off because it gets a little bit vigorous.  Or 
you’d say let’s move away from here a bit because there’s too many 
glasses here.  If you fall over whilst we’re dancing – 
 
Anthony: 
It’s the same behavior. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Igor: 
So you’re smart, adult, human beings.  Just apply those smart, 
adult, human being choices to people that you’re with and treat 
them with respect, treat them kindly, look after them, and they’ll 
look after you.  You’ll all have a great time.  It will be a fantastic 
evening. And people will think that you’ll have changed their life.  
They’ll have an experience of you in their lives that has taken them 
out of the hum drum normal every day world to wow, remember 
that day 10 years ago when that hypnotist came into the bar and 
just did this crazy stuff? That was awesome.  I wish I could see them 
again or whatever. So that’s the power that you have.   
 
 
You have a real power to be a force for good in people’s lives, to 
empower them to do good things.  Let’s not get carried away by our 
mystique and realize that there are things in the background that 
we’re paying attention to, to keep them safe, to keep them from 
falling over, to keep them from damaging themselves and so on.  If 
that happens, if you look after people, if you’re respectful of 
people, honestly, none of this other stuff will happen, and you’ll be 
in really good shape.  So really what we’re asking you guys to do is 
have some common sense.  Enjoy what you’re doing and people 
will be able to enjoy it. 
 
Anthony: 
Behave like you care about this person and that they are vulnerable 
at that point. They may not look it, but treat them as if – 
 
Igor: 
Better still, care. If you generally care for the people you’ll with, it 
will automatically take all this into effect.  If it’s your 5-year-old 
niece, you’re not going to have her dancing on the table in the 
middle of bottles because you’ll go dancing is fun, but different 
table maybe. So treat them like your 5-year-old niece so that you’ll 
have the same respect, the same attention, the same care. And a 
lot of this stuff that we talk about just vanishes.  It just doesn’t 
exist. 
 
Anthony: 
I know Igor doesn’t like scary stories, but I’ve got to give you two 
more – we are going to get out of here. But again, this is just 
another reason for you to pay attention.  Sometimes you make a 
suggestion, they start acting on it, it’s funny.  Their friend asks you a 
question, you’re over here, they run.  Peter Powers is one of the 
most famous stage hypnotists from the UK.  He’s got a lot of press 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
156 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
at the fact that a guy ran out of his theater down the street chasing 
rubber lizards.  That’s not good.  He’s got a show to do.  He can’t be 
there as well.  It’s really not good, so you don’t let people run.  A 
stage hypnotist I know in Scotland was just going through his 
standard routines, one of which is you’re an Olympic swimmer.  
 
 
There’s a nice table there.  You assume that they’re going to lie 
down on the table and start doing front crawls, it’s very amusing 
when they do. No. Jumped up on the table, dived at the floor.  
Ouch. That’s going to cause the hypnotist a problem.  You’ve done 
some fun stuff, you’ve had some physical tests, you’ve seen some 
people laughing.  You might be thinking I haven’t really been 
hypnotized or whatever.  What you need to get your head around is 
that people, when they are there hypnotized, will take your 
suggestions literally.  That is their belief in that moment. And they’ll 
behave accordingly. And if appropriate behavior is to start 
defending themselves or to take some emergency action or to run 
because it’s so scary, that’s what they’ll do.  
 
 
And you have to just be aware of it. Constantly be aware of where 
your subject is at.  That is the only person that matters to you at 
that time. I sometimes say it to them as I’m putting them in doing 
the procedural instructions.  I say right now, you’re all that matters 
to me.  You have my complete respect.  You’re going to have a 
great time.  I just say it.  And I will often remind people your friends 
are around you.  You’re safe, you’re well, you’re protected.  You 
heard me say it to Ben earlier. There’s no need to say it.  He knows 
he is.  But spitting out some of those lines shows everyone else 
who’s watching that you care, and it shows the subject that right, 
I’m in safe hands.   
 
 
So there should not be any issues. The only other big scaremongery 
story is really abreactions.  I’ve got to mention it because this is why 
hypnotherapists will campaign to get you banned. And so only 
licensed dentists and doctors should do this.  When someone is 
hypnotized, they can have an abreaction. In fact, in the therapy 
room, if they don’t, I’m disappointed.  I want an abreaction.  I want 
them to feel a few seconds of pain.  They’re not going to feel it for 
very long. An abreaction, when you’re not kind of coaxing it out of 
someone, is a bit of a shock for the first time you experience it as a 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
157 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
hypnotist.  It generally takes the form of a massive emotional 
outpouring.  Instant tears, snot, wailing, noise, panic.  
 
 
The very, very, very worst thing you can do at that moment is say 
wake up because all this emotion is here, and they just go bang, and 
they bring it back to the room, and it is bad.  So again, I’ve been 
accused by hypnotherapists of being flippant for giving this advice. 
But my advice is this, that person is suggestible. When they’re in 
high emotional state, I said this to you earlier, they’re even more 
suggestible. So first stop is suggest it away.  You can leave all those 
feelings behind you. Do not go into therapy mode. Do not start 
doing some impromptu therapy.  Just suggest it away.  You can 
leave all those feelings and memories behind you.   
 
 
In a moment, I’m going to count you to five, and you’ll be back in 
your room wide awake and alert.  I probably wouldn’t go through 
feeling fantastic like you’ve had eight hours sleep.  But I would still 
ensure that they’re feeling good, back to normal, so that I can say 
you’re feeling good. 
Igor: 
Just to add to this, the key thing here is don’t, as a rule, start the 
wake up procedure until they’ve already calmed down. So Anthony 
here is abreacting, I say, the memory fades, the emotions fade, 
calming down.  Now let it all fade.  Let it all fade.  Let it all go. Then 
you can give a little bit of protection around there, and you can 
forget as much as you need to, to keep yourself safe and secure and 
so on. Now, you’re back in the calm, good place.  I’ll count from one 
to three.  At the count of three, you’re coming back. But you notice 
how I’m not counting them out until afterwards.  Now, we’ll do 
some abreaction drills tomorrow to actually get you used to the 
actual language and all the rest of it.  Those who have trained with 
me before, you already know them.   
 
 
I think it’s important to do. For tonight, each group will be with an 
experience hypnotist.  If that happens, we’ll be able to step in and 
help you out with that. So really don’t concern yourself about it too 
much.  Let the principles stick in the back of your mind.  Know that 
you’re safe in the sense that we’ll jump in if something happens.  
Abreactions are very rare.  I’ve seen maybe two spontaneous ones 
in the whole of my hypnotic career of which one was a cheating 
lady who forced the abreaction on me because it was in a seminar 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
158 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
scenario, and she just wanted free therapy. So she basically 
dumped it in the wrong place. 
 
Anthony: 
I’ve never seen one in performance, and I’ve seen a couple that 
were unexpected in therapy. So just talk it away, and then wake 
them up. You’ve had your fun, don’t disappear. Make sure they feel 
good.  And make sure that your language is nice and clean at that 
point as well in terms of how you ask the questions. I’ve had people 
who were like are you all right?  It’s like, all right? Of course they’re 
not because they’re still suggestible, and you’ve just said – this is all 
bad. So ask the question.  Are you feeling good?  Are you back with 
us?  Are you relaxed?   
 
 
That kind of thing. So to avoid the situation that is so rare it barely 
warrants speaking about but we have to, to avoid that situation, 
you’re going to avoid suggestions, which could lead someone to an 
unexpected emotional event.  So again, this is right there in the 
guidelines. Do not regress people.  When you’re doing 
performance, do not regress people. You can get a lot of funny 
routines out of turning someone into a kid, but the only 
prosecution of a stage hypnotist in this country, and it wasn’t a 
hypnotism act, it’s negligence, is go back to when you were six, 
which is fine. But she was abused when she was six continuously, so 
she ran around the back of her chair and needed a lot of therapy to 
undo that.   
 
 
There’s no way she was going to see a hypnotherapist. She 
probably should have.  Do not regress people. Do not send them 
back to particular points and events in their lives.  There’s just no 
need.  If you see a reaction starting to bubble up, just talk it away 
and go somewhere else.  I think that’s about it. I just wanted to 
make you aware of it. Should it happen, do not panic and just say 
wake up, wake up.  Talk it away, and then do a wake up. But you 
can’t get locked into it.  You can’t get stuck in it. All the usual stuff 
we were going over this morning to make people feel comfortable 
with it is true.  So say it and give them that comfort. 
 
Igor: 
So after all that wonderful introduction to tonight’s field hypnosis, 
remember, we’ve been talking about the extreme cases.   This is 
right at the edge.  If you do what you’ve been trained to do, if you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
159 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
treat people with respect, none of this stuff will happen.  You’ll 
have us there to help you out tonight as well, so really, put that to 
one side.  Just remember, we’re going to be looking for you to treat 
people well, treat them with respect, have safety on your mind, and 
really, the rest of it just takes care of itself. And the main point is 
just have fun, guys. Go out there, meet people, do your whole intro.   
 
 
If you’re too hesitant to meet someone you don’t know yet, do you 
want to know a cheat that will work every single time that will get 
you into their interaction really easily?  Anyone interested in that?  
You can do this once we’ve left as well.  It’s really simple.  Can I 
borrow you guys? Just come over here, would you?  Great.  Just 
stand with your hands like this, would you?  Put them together.  
Now, I’m going out with these guys.  They know me.  This is easy, 
isn’t it?  What’s everyone else in the bar going to do? What’s 
happening here?  This is the important part.  If you miss the what’s 
happening here look, then this becomes just a routine you do with 
your friends in a bar.  
 
 
If you see the what’s happening look here like oh, just watch. Don’t 
worry.  I’m not going to make you do anything.  Just watch these 
guys.  Come on, it’s okay.  Yes, you.  Come.  Come to me.  That’s it.  
Now, did you see how I had to cajole her a little bit to get in there. 
Don’t worry.  Just watch these guys.  You’ll enjoy this.  You may as 
well come up. Do you know each other yet?  Meet each other.  Say 
hello.  And now, you’re about to have a wonderful time.  You guys, 
put the hands up, fingers up, like this.  Now, once you’ve done this, 
I start to collect a group around me.  These are my friends. I know 
I’m going to succeed anyway. That’s going to up my status as a 
hypnotist anyway.  
 
 
So once they’ve done something successfully, you’ll go how did you 
guys enjoy it?  Great.  Did you like that?  Did you have a go at 
something like this?  All right.  Put your hands out like this and we’ll 
do something different.  Now, just by watching someone else 
succeed, they’ll buy into that whole atmosphere as well.  It’s a 
really easy way of collecting a group without the stress of having to 
meet someone. So if you’re feeling a bit more shy, feel free to use 
that.  If you’re not, I recommend that you just go into the idea of 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
160 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
just talking to people and getting used to that because it’s a great 
skill to have anyway.  
 
 
But if you’re feeling a bit shy, that’s a really good way of getting 
around it sort of indirectly.  Does that make sense to you guys?  So 
it’s a fun way of doing it.  Keep it safe.  Keep it fun.  Keep it simple.  
If you’re too afraid of doing all the big things, then just do a few 
simple things and build your confidence up over time. That’s just 
fine.

Street Debrief 
 
Igor: 
How did last night go?  There’s silence. Ohhhhh. 
Anthony: 
Any more stories, any anecdotes?  
Igor: 
There is a whole bunch of different experiences I saw you guys 
doing so who went out there and started approaching some people, 
doing some street hypnosis and stuff like that?  Yeah?  How did that 
go, did you enjoy it? 
Audience Member: Very much. 
Igor: 
When you first start off it is like “Ehh”, but then there is some point 
when there is this invisible seal gets peeled off and it’s like I am an 
animal, I am hypno-man, I am unstoppable, get out of my way, I 
must find more people.  Anyone have that sort of strange reaction?   
Audience Member: No.

Igor: 
Right here, what was that?  Did you? 
Audience Member: Not yet.  
Igor: 
We’ll have some more stories than this. 
Audience Member: It wasn’t – it was OK. 
Igor: 
It was okay. 
Audience Member: Well it was not like that, but at some point, you know, It was 
definitely a good feeling when one success after another, like I had 
three in a row, that was like wow. And then I had three rejections 
and one failure in a row too. So, that was like discouraging.   
Igor: 
It’s disappointing right? 
Audience Member: It didn’t have a point where it was like oh – I mean we had a couple 
of guys in our group that were like, let’s do it this way, but it’s a 
great feeling.  I mean at some point I was really – I didn’t expect the 
result and you know when it happened and the person was like 
wow, what just happened to me?  I’m like oh my god, was it me? 
Igor: 
Oh my god, I did it.  
Audience Member: So that’s of course – 
Igor: 
Very validating isn’t it?   
Anthony: 
And did you kind of help having a bit of a structure, did you kind of 
stick to that? 
Audience Member: Definitely, I mean I tried to improvise a couple of times with some, 
not like real improvisation, but just some changes to the routine 
and it was okay, but definitely the structure is the most important 
thing at least to start off and maybe with experience after – 
Igor: 
I can rightfully say with experience all of the stuff, you start going 
different directions or you’ll see something and say oh I’ll go with 
that, but until you get experience this is a way of borrowing our 
experience until you’ve built up enough on your behalf and you go 
oh that is all old stuff, I’m going to do the new stuff now.  Which is 
exactly how it should work.

Audience Member: Right, I mean, I had a couple of interesting situations where the 
person said, you know the person was very compliant and I did a 
couple of suggestions in the beginning and it worked very well.  
Step forward this and that, your feet together, and I was like okay 
inside of my head it’s like another success. Great. And then we start 
doing this thing, you know this thing with the fingers and nothing is 
happening.  I’m looking in her eyes and I see she’s consciously 
resisting what I’m doing.  I didn’t know what to say so I said – I tried 
to throw a couple of things like just release your resistance, just let 
it go and she’s smiling at me.  I’m like okay you’re trying to resist it 
consciously and she’s like of course I am.  What do you think I’m 
supposed to do from being hypnotized? 
Igor: 
Exactly. 
Audience Member: And I said you know, just have a good time, relax.  I tried like three 
or four arguments, nothing worked.  Okay. 
Igor: 
Those are the people you’ll come across and at some point you’ll 
figure out how to work with them.  Really the key to working with a 
person like that is to – it’s going to sound a trite when I say it, but 
the key is to not let think.  Get them to the point where they can’t 
think anymore.  You give them so many other things to maybe focus 
on or consider that they stop trying to resist.  The resistance thing 
can come from two places.  One is a challenge frame, I challenge 
you alright and the other one is well you’re hypnotizing me, I must 
try and resist you so that you can prove to me that it’s working.   
With the second kind of people, several approaches can work.  One 
is to say this is not hypnosis, let’s do a mental warm up first 
because then it is about following instructions, right?  Can you 
follow instructions?  Yes.  Well why are you resisting? Because I’m 
supposed to.  Did I tell you that?  No.  Well let’s follow instructions, 
let’s start again.  Put your feet together.  Can you put your feet 
together?  Did you resist that?  No.  Why not?  Because you told me 
to put my feet together.  Great.  So you’re building it up in a very 
slow process there.   
Last night was it I think – I can’t remember who, but someone was 
working with a gentleman who was having something similar going 
on. He was doing the stiff arm and saying like oh I can bend my arm, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
163 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
I can bend my arm, see I can bend my arm, see.  My arm bends see.  
It’s like all right, I’ve got idea that you can bend your arm, right?   
So there is just the question of you making a joke out of it, say, “Of 
course you can bend your arm, we’re not there yet, right?” So you 
might even try saying something like, with a person like that, “Oh 
course there’s a time to resist, but we’re not there yet.” Right?  In 
which case they say oh I see, it comes later. Yeah, it comes later.  It 
comes never.   
You see how you have to outmaneuver the thought patterns a little 
bit because eventually you get to the point where they’ll pause that 
pattern, you’re not trying to stop it, you’re just trying to pause it 
long enough for something else to occur and then honestly they 
won’t care about it anymore.  They’ll go oh wow this is really 
working and then they’re so excited about that they forget the 
whole resistance thing. 
Anthony: 
Again, that to me is part of the value of having a structure. Is you 
can achieve the proof of concepts before you get to the hypnosis.  
They’ve already let that go because this has happened and this has 
happened, whatever kind of set piece or exercises, whatever you 
want to call them.   
Last night when we first went out quite a few of us encountered 
someone saying no, you can’t do that to me or I don’t believe it in.  
We had quite a few I don’t believe in it.  It was all over you to 
hypnotize him. But if people use the word believe, I just say well 
there’s nothing to believe in.  It’s not – it doesn’t require faith, it’s 
not some mystical thing.  Certainly you’re going to have an amazing 
experience, but what I need you to do is – Then just get straight 
back on the track I want to get on which is I need you to use your 
mind, I need you to concentrate and use your imagination.  Once 
you take that away – because some people want to have that 
experience, but don’t believe in hypnosis because they don’t know 
enough about it. Yes, so that’s one of the misconceptions that you 
need to have to undo. It doesn’t require belief.   
 
Someone said to my father years ago, it was a therapy session, but 
the guy just walked in, never mind he was about to pay the best 
part of 200 pounds to quit smoking, just walked in and said this is 
going to be a challenge.  It is going to be a challenge?

Igor: 
Great times. 
Anthony: 
You’re going to win.  Come back when you want to do this.  I said to 
someone last night who was kind of saying it’s going to be really 
difficult and it was still – as I said sometimes when people are 
saying you can’t hypnotize me, it isn’t that they have got a 
challenge mind set, they just don’t believe that they’re capable or 
what will happen or whatever else.  Sometimes when they say it – 
and one guy, maybe it was somebody else was working with him, a 
tall guy with a coat, he had on last night? 
Audience Member: That was my guy. 
Anthony: 
Yeah, he was slightly more of a kind of challenge mind set.  I don’t 
think he was trying to make you look a fool, but no in fact it was 
you that was working with him and there was a moment where you 
were doing really well, you did everything right and then you pulled 
him into your shoulder and he looked to his friends and opened his 
eyes, it was like I’m still here guys.  Again, it’s not -- if that happens 
on stage, I always have a guy on the other side of the stage to 
watch for those people because it’s not like it’s necessarily going to 
derail your whole show, but if you don’t know that person’s putting 
faces every time you turn him around then you can lose a bit of 
credibility.   
It is the same with the guy last night.  I think he did want to have 
the experience. He didn’t believe he could have the experience and 
as it turned out he was not that hypnotically talented in that 
particular moment, but he didn’t slip that he was playing the fool 
and sort of claw back a bit of control.  If you spot it – you were 
doing well, but it’s kind of like if he’s here you can’t actually see 
him.  So, sometimes you’ve just got to step back with a test if things 
were going well before, but they’re not anymore.   
Who else had a good result an anecdote that they will be 
repeating?  Yes? 
Audience Member: Hi. Actually I had really set aside what I did and when you said 
about structure, I did only, only what we do here, nothing more, 
nothing less.  I just followed what you said and what we practiced 
and it went really, really good.

Igor: 
Great, and to emphasize this to everyone, the reason the structure 
is considered like training wheels on a bike, by the time you’re 80 
years old you’re hopefully not riding the same bike with the same 
training wheels, you’ve graduated beyond that.  At the same token, 
the first time on the bike it is probably useful to have them there 
until you’re ready to bounce and go your own way.  Does that make 
sense to you guys?  So you had a great result there. 
Audience Member: Actually the first subject I had was really, really good subject.  
Actually when – there were three girls and one of them decided to 
go and after the finger vise, she was talking to us like, “Wow, I tried 
to resist but I could not, wow.” She was so into it, all freaky, freaky 
and I asked her if she wanted to do another exercise.  Yes, yes and 
every time she talked to them, Wow, it was so –So it’s really good 
subject probably, hey. 
Igor: 
It’s great for you as well, having those first few moments of success 
kind of justifies – for me it was kind of years of failing because I 
went all around schools at first, and it’s just having one or two real 
successes like, “Ah, I’m a real hypnotist!  Wow, I found my power 
somewhere.” 
Audience Member: Actually it was when we were practicing here and when I do a light 
hand, actually this guy is helping me and it just happened like, wow, 
why is this hand going up? 
Anthony: 
Yeah and you will start to even with things like that arm levitation, 
it’s kind of different for everybody, but you will after a while start to 
recognize the difference between a genuine, unconscious response 
and someone trying to please you.  If I was to say in a moment one 
of your fingers is just going to lift up and you thought I don’t want 
to make the hypnotist look silly, the chances are you’d lift up your 
index finger.  You would raise it out like this, but you say your hand 
is going to lift up or your finger is going to lift up, very often it will 
be this kind of twitching movement or you’ll see that it kind of 
comes up by the wrist like it’s being pulled up. 
Again, it’s a bit like I was pointing – when you were working with 
people last night, the rest of us who were kind of spectating, I kept 
saying, look, that is the face, that is what I want to see.  That’s the 
look that still there, they’re empty, they’re just in the moment even 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
166 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
though they’re doing magnetic hands they are very much present in 
that entire experience.   
And it’s the same with movement.  You know, if it’s like -- , they are 
not aware they have kind of given themselves away at that point, 
there are various things you can do, you can just put it down and 
say not that mind and blast on them again suggestions and 
hopefully get some unconscious movement.  But as you can see 
people are hooked in by these silly little exercises and you heard it 
last night, and these are adults, these professionals, “Oh my god, 
my fingers touched!” 
Igor:  
 
They’re all blown away. 
Audience Member: After every exercise, she was like, “Oh, I tried it. It was really 
strange. My hand just goes up. I didn’t even do that by myself.”  
Actually she’s giving me feedback every time, not to me to the girls 
actually. 
Igor: 
It’s like great what else happened. 
Audience Member: After that she was talking all around people, people come talking 
about the truth.  It was really good subject.   
Igor: 
That is also by the way, how you make your life really easy, one 
good subject could really open your whole night up because then 
they’ll bring other people in. You want to try it, you want to try it. 
And suddenly they’re all buying you drinks, giving you money. 
Anthony: 
That’s what happened in the square, pretty soon we had a good 20 
people standing around and the fact is no one really playing the 
crowd last night.  Like, you saw Bob early on. He did brilliantly and I 
know he’s got some training and he’s got the language down.  He’s 
got the whole Morgan Freeman thing going on. But it works very 
effectively in focusing your attention, right? You were doing it and 
you were getting through the phenomena, but by that point you 
were here, but and the subjects here.  Now that’s very, very 
effective in terms of keeping that relationship stable and there’s no 
kind of boxing him in psychologically in a fashion, but at some point 
you’ve got to recognize your audience is here.  I know you’re on 
stage, but this is the situation and part of – I do traditional stage 
hypnosis.  I’m not a massive fan of the model. It’s not exactly where 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
167 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
I want to be when I’m on stage, not exactly the performance I want 
to give.   
The toughest thing for me to learn because I’m so focused on the 
subjects and I continuously hammering them with hypnotic 
language, is to back off, to look at the audience and say, “Now what 
should we do with this guy? As you can see and relate it back to 
their life and again anyone who works professionally on stage will 
probably gotten to this point where they do that naturally.   
For me it took a bit of time and it’s the same on the street. At first 
my -- that hypnotic relationship is so intense, I’m absolutely focused 
on that person.  But all the audience see, they don’t necessarily 
hear the suggestion and then they just see it happening and think 
what’s happening.  Part of the gag, in the traditional model, is more 
often not, the audience hears the suggestion and they have an 
opportunity to play it out in their head and, “No way! That’s not 
going to happen.  There’s no way he would do that.” Or so they’ve 
already kind of got this emotion rising and it goes.  You set them off 
and normally it’s wilder than what they’ve imagined anyway.  So for 
you, I think you did brilliantly, but you’ve got a decently resonating 
voice, it’s like back off, at least kind of get arm length again and 
look at the audience, just look up.  We’re going to get into a lot 
more of these kind of details today, just making it more 
professional even though we’re out doing this kind of impromptu.   
You want to be a professional; you want more people to hear what 
you’re saying, more people to get their imagination involved in the 
suggestions and then fire it and sure every now and again you need 
to connect that closely to a person, you just go and do it.  Once 
you’ve gotten them in that position and they’ve been through some 
of the phenomena you can just speak plain English. You can slow 
down, you can speak to the rest of the group, just let them know, 
“You can drift deeper and deeper as I speak to everybody here.” 
And they will do.  So we’ll get into a lot more of this stuff today.

Performance Skills 
 
Igor: 
Look, just grab the mic. Bring it up here first. Let’s come on to you 
first as you’ve been waiting very patiently.  Now one thing to add 
onto that which is just consider this in the back of your mind that 
again, we’ll be covering this more this morning because that’s 
where we’re going with the idea developing performances.   
Think of it more like you’re presenting a play on the streets or 
actually wherever you doing it. So you probably have been to plays 
that have really riveted your attention and things that weren’t that 
really interesting.  You’re creating an atmosphere for people.  Now 
one of the people you create an atmosphere for is the person 
you’re hypnotizing, that’s very important, that’s hypnotic contact.  
Hypnotic contact bleeds out to the people watching, so you want to 
create that atmosphere and embrace them as well.   
Consider this, I could do an arm levitation with Anthony and that 
would be pretty impressive, right, because unless you’ve been 
through the hypnosis game a few times and you go oh yeah, that’s 
arm levitation, it really becomes a perfunctory thing. But someone 
who hasn’t seen it before it’s like wow that hand’s lifting and it’s 
like magic, right?  What if I had him in trance and I took time out to 
ignore him, so he can go deeper and have your experience or 
whatever and I spoke to you guys for a bit.  What if I told you a 
ghost story at the end of which something about the floating arm or 
whatever happens and then I say, “Observe.” And meanwhile, 
maybe even because he’s gone with some imbedded suggestion 
whatever it is, his arm starts floating through the story and 
suddenly people go, “Aww.” The story’s coming to life for them.  
Now can you imagine that being a much more powerful moment, 
more moving, more engaging for everyone around them, around 
you, than just watching the arm float up?  That itself is very 
impressive.   
So that’s really the level that we’re going to start encouraging you 
guys to start thinking at today.  How can you create an experience 
for people where what they’re observing actually means something 
other than just being – this is why I love working with Anthony 
because he’s one of the few street hypnotists I’ve come across who 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
169 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
don’t just do stunts.  He doesn’t just stick someone’s hand on the 
table and go there you go.  All right, next trick. Right? He creates an 
actual performance; he actually builds a story with it, he actually 
evolves it into something.  And -- 
Anthony: 
Even it is someone asking a question, is that really possible, what 
would I do if I could do that; wouldn’t it be funny if you could do 
that?  Just allow. It’s a bit like giving suggestions and I keep 
mentioning therapy in a street hypnosis course, but quite often 
what I’m trying to do in those situations, and on stage, is paint a 
picture with just two brush strokes. I’m just like, swish, swish. I 
want the subject to essentially fill in that canvas instantly, but I’m 
just going to give them little shoves and little nudges in certain 
directions, but they’re going to populate it.  A big part of the art for 
me is giving a suggestion, but giving the person room to respond.  
Yeah and their response may need a bit of encouragement, it might 
need a bit of shaping, it might be ten times funnier if they do this at 
the top of their voice or whatever.  
But as I say, giving some context even the things I’ve done like 
stealing drinks, getting stuff off a stool, it’s just about theft. Yes, 
personally I want to know if I can walk out of the store with 
something and not pay; it’s my own personal research purposes. 
Right? 
Igor: 
I just want to emphasis, he gives it back again afterward. There’s no 
police chasing him right now.  
Anthony:  
But there are a lot of ideas in hypnosis that need to be challenged 
such people not doing anything against their best interest and so on 
and so forth.  So for me although that stuff is entertainment, that’s 
purely what it’s about, the reason I care to work with myself and 
take you down that road, because we’ve got unanswered questions 
and as amazing as Erickson is, he took some of his attitudes and his 
1950s stable family attitudes into some of the research he did and 
possibly proved himself correct.  Just as other have done exactly the 
same thing, but found a completely different result.  So as Igor said 
there, context, speaking to your audience, putting a couple 
brushstrokes down for them, you’re essentially doing the same 
thing.  You’re allowing their imagination to populate something and 
then this becomes -- 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Igor: 
Mind blowing. 
 
Anthony: 
-- Frankenstein arm. 
 
Igor: 
And by the way, that’s why for example your, your -- the girls you 
work with -- why something as simple as this can be mind blowing.  
Because they already filled in a canvas for you.  Now instead of 
taking a risk, why don’t you do what Anthony’s suggesting and now 
start presenting simple suggestions to your audience?  Not for 
behaviors but for an experience that they can fill in and suddenly 
attach so much more meaning to this.  Now all of a sudden this can 
become a whole 15, 20 minute routine just that on its own and 
people will be blown away by it.   
 
I know, we will come on to you, I’m sorry, to tell your story.   
 
It just reminds me of when I was a little kid.  Those of you that are 
from England will of course know Paul Daniels.  He had a magic 
show every, every -- I think it was every Friday or something like 
that on the TV for years and years and years.  I was, I was 
fascinated.  He was a great performer.  So one year, maybe I was 
10, 11, 12,  I don’t know, sometime in that age range.  I got a Paul 
Daniels magic kit for Christmas.   
 
I was so excited.  I had my little curtain I put across the desk and 
made a little magic stall.  Opened my box up and there’s all these 
little cheap plastic cups and plastic coins and whatnot.  I have to say 
I was disappointed.  Right?  What they should say on magic boxes is 
magic not included.  Because you have to bring -- the magic is really 
the performance.  It’s a story that you tell.  It’s the way you bring 
people into it.  The trick is just the emotional release to the whole 
thing.  Does that make sense?   
 
So people buy magic because they want to create that atmosphere 
but then the trick -- they end up becoming tricksters.  They just do 
little tricks and there’s no atmosphere.  There’s no magic.  The 
great magicians, whether it’s David Blaine that you like or David 
Copperfield or another David or whoever -- I guess that’s a proper 
magician’s name.  The real magic happens when they present some 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
171 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
form of story directly or indirectly.  In other words, the canvas is put 
in place and suddenly the floating woman is like, wow, this is a 
beautiful thing.  Now suddenly the floating man is like, wow, this is 
a freaky thing.  And really it’s the same trick it just depends on the 
canvas that’s been presented to you as a coin to that trick.  Does 
that kind of make sense to you guys?  And that’s why this just one 
half of an inch, I mean that’s not a lot, is it?  But that can be as mind 
blowing.  I mean let’s put it this way, David Blaine just blew 
people’s minds by standing on one leg.  Right? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
It’s his levitation stunt.  For those of you who don’t know, it’s called 
a Balducci levitation.  I’m not going to show it here because this is 
not the kind of thing.  But literally you’re standing on one leg.  
Everyone thinks like, oh my God, he’s flying.  Right?  He milked that.  
And you can do the same with this plus all the other things you 
have on top of that.  You can really blow people’s minds. 
 
Anthony: 
You know there’s, there’s some, again it’s staged, but there’s some 
good stage hypnotist’s who give a corporation a presentation that’s 
again not just about humiliation.  It’s an opportunity to you know, 
lock someone’s arm out or stick them to the chair.  And then to turn 
to the audience and say, “Look, now you guys are all top sales 
people for such and such a company but do you understand here 
how much of what you do is based on belief.  Because right now 
you don’t believe you can stand up, do you?  But if I click my 
fingers, you can.  But you can’t sit down.”  And it -- and it -- for the 
audience again this is a beautiful illustration of the power of belief 
and how the mind stops you doing things.  They will handle that 
pop psychology that they’ve already got onto those experiences.   
 
But it -- but it’s about you recognizing that once you got your 
person hypnotized -- no, they’re not just going to stay there 
forever.  And I’ve said it’s kind of a fragile state.  I’m going to 
contradict myself now and say once you’ve got them and you’ve got 
some phenomena, as long as you suggest that they can stay there 
then it actually can become quite stable.  As long as you put what 
you’re doing in context -- I’m just going to speak to the rest of the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
172 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
group while you go deeper and deeper into hypnosis.  They will stay 
there and they’ll stay there for a long period of time.  I know that.   
 
We did some filming for a pilot of the show.  It’s called I Know What 
You Did Last Friday.  And the subject was just into everything.  He 
was into -- we had big props like a taxi.  He was into the cameras.  
He was into the cables.  He was just -- we were changing the tape.  
He was just into everything.  And in the end, I just put him in kind of 
suspended animation.  Just leave him on the curb and just hang 
there for ten minutes lying in the park.  Um, but he was in blissful 
state. That’s what I said he’d be.  
 
Again if I wanted to, I can turn and I can talk and you can -- you can 
kind of expand on what you’ve done.  In fact make a bigger point to 
your audience then this really proves.  But, you know, there’s lots of 
different directions you can take it but just try and give your subject 
and your audience a bit of space to populate whatever own -- their 
own ideas, their own imagination. 
 
 
Street Debrief 2 
 
Igor: 
So let’s get back to your experiences again because we got a little 
bit derailed there.   
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
I think hopefully -- was that useful to you guys?  Does it give you 
more flesh if you like to the whole performance thing?  So do you 
want to just stand up and just tell us a little bit about how your 
magic moments went last night? 
 
Audience Member: Sure, one of the first ones was a young girl who was kind of not a 
super good hypnotic subject. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah. 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Audience Member: Although you said her face was definitely the vacant one.  After that 
we had started -- there was several of us that were working this one 
square and we started to attract a pretty good crowd.  And I had a 
guy walking up who clearly had had several pints.  And he kind of 
staggered up and he said -- I forget exactly what his language was 
but I don’t believe in any of this stuff.  I think it’s all just a joke.  And 
a lot of people believe that.  It’s easier just to see so I did just a 
very, very quick thing with him.  I did the fingers and the magnetic 
hands and then just took him down and did an arm catalepsy.  And 
then brought him out and said, how was that.  And he’s like, wow, 
that was really cool.  You know it’s fun.  Off you go. And then went 
to work with other people.  And then he came back later and he 
went up to Anthony and said, “I’m ready for the whole deal. I’m 
leaving England tomorrow. This is my last night.” 
 
 
Audience Member: So Anthony came and grabbed me and he’s like, hey, your guy is -- 
he’s ready for more.  And so this time I said, you’ve already been 
down a couple times.  You know how to do this so the induction the 
second time around was just, right handed or left handed.  I’m right 
handed.  Can I see your hand?  And down immediately.  And his 
friends were -- now a crowd is really kind of starting to gather.  And 
his friends are just like, “Oh, holy cow.  I can’t believe this.”  And 
stuck his feet to the ground and did a couple of other things.  
Anthony comes walking up and is whispering in my ear.  He says, 
“Tell him that he can’t walk and the only way he can move is by 
pogo, which conveniently he has.  And you know what it sounds like 
when you jump with a pogo.  Boing, boing.  And the higher you go, 
the funner you get.”  And so immediately went did that, stuck his 
feet to the ground, told him the only way that he could move was 
by pogo.  And I demonstrated it for him a couple of times just to 
show.  And I did the boing.  But like after two of those, he started 
ba-doom, ba-doom! 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
Audience Member: And he’s laughing, ba-doom, ba-doom! And I think we might have 
done one more thing with him and then I just left him with just kind 
of an overall empowering hypnotic bliss that you’re going to have a 
really wonderful time.  This is going to be the greatest -- and one of 
the things that I had done actually was get him in touch with one of

the -- I stuck his hand to his chest in one of the other things and the 
emotion that I had him attach to was the best night he’s ever had 
with these friends that he’s visiting. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Audience Member: And just had that feeling get stronger and stronger.  And the 
stronger it gets, the stronger the bond is.  Try as you might and you 
won’t be able to take your hand away.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
And then re-did that again and amped it up again and then boom, 
we’re off and he goes.  He walks away and then he comes running 
back and then big bear hug.  He goes, “This was the greatest night.  
Thank you so much.”  And at that point, we could have stayed there 
all night long because then it was like -- 
 
Igor: 
Would you guys say that’s a force for good in people’s lives or not? 
Right? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
You see like in the entertainment, there’s nothing embarrassing.  
The point is you’re making people’s lives better while showing some 
cool stuff as well, right? 
 
 
Anthony: 
It was -- what was good as well, it’s a small point, but the reason I 
said that you can’t walk, you can only -- I have many variations on 
the end of that sentence.  You can’t walk, you can only Riverdance.  
You can’t walk, you can only moonwalk.  Whatever it happens to be 
-- is because I wanted you to do a routine involving movement.  And 
as we get into this today, we’ll talk about routines that are going to 
get you much more attention, vocal routines that really grab a lot of 
attention.  Rather than just I can’t remember my name which is 
really just you and the person and the person with the camera 
phone.  So you get a person moving around the square like that and 
it normally gets a lot of attention.   
 
What was interesting was as hypnotized as the guy looked and I 
believe he was wholeheartedly.  When you said you can’t walk, you 
can only pogo, he still needed a bit of encouragement.  He was in 
this kind of a situation and he just started to go like, he didn’t take a 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
175 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
step but he was trying to take a step.  And again you just said, 
“That’s right. You’re on your pogo.”  Whatever.  Gave him a little 
half a bounce and boing and he was off.   
 
I’m just trying to point out that even then you had to do a bit of 
work.  You had to push it again and frame it up again.  Sell it again.  
And sometimes you have to do that.  Sometimes you just need a bit 
more control there. 
 
Igor: 
All right.  Let’s go over here.  Stand up so everyone can see you as 
well. 
 
Audience Member: Yesterday, I hypnotized two girls that were, they were these girls 
that give you fliers. 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Audience Member: But the really weird thing about it, it was almost like a Derren 
Brown moment because you know when you start off, you have to 
build suggestion.  Keep building it.  Well half -- when I walked up to 
them, they both said they were working and it was like, “If you can’t 
do this, you can do this.  Can’t you?”  The first thing they said, 
“Well, I’m holding these fliers so I can’t work with you.”  I said, 
“Yea, but you can put them down though, couldn’t you?”  Yes, 
they’re going to put them down.  “Oh, but they’ll blow away.”  
Yeah, but if I put my bag on top of them, they won’t blow will 
they?” “No, they won’t.” “Okay.” “Yeah, but I’m holding my phone.” 
“Okay, well, you give me your phone. I’ll call it anyway.”  “And, 
yeah, what about my phone?” “I’ll take your phone as well.”   
 
Igor: 
Run.   
 
Audience Member: So in the end, we did the finger thing and the arm thing.  But 
halfway through it, their boss actually came out and said, do you 
think they can do a bit of work now.  I was like, you can do some 
work now and then they were out. 
 
Anthony: 
Again that’s kind of a testament to what we said about introducing 
yourself properly.  You say you’re a performer.  I’m performing 
here.  That’s the kind of thing you can get away with.  I don’t mean 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
176 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
literally sneak off with.  I just mean you can make ridiculous 
requests and people are like, yeah, there must be a reason. 
 
Igor: 
Should be fun.  
 
Audience Member: I have to say it was one of the most intense nights so far in my life. 
 
Anthony: 
Excellent. 
 
Audience Member: I have to say I had the guts to walk up to somebody directly.  Like 
the routine, we did that yesterday.  It worked. What worked for me 
was just getting in front of people, have a chat with them, warming 
them up and then asking whether they want to get hypnotized.  It 
works very well.  I had two runs, hypnotized a girl, hypnotized a 
man from Spain.  And it was really cool, definitely. 
 
Anthony: 
Good job. 
 
Igor: 
Well done, Ben.  Yes, yes, very worthwhile. 
 
What I would like to do now is get back into a little bit of 
performance mode.  It’s good to kind of share some war stories.  
Some of you had some real great successes.  We talked about some 
of them.  Some of you had like a little tougher time as well.  Just 
remember that with anything, this is performance art.  You’re really 
the cutting edge.  This is probably the hardest form of hypnosis to 
do.  Not because of the hypnosis element.  That’s actually relatively 
mechanical.  Just because of all the social, environmental issues.   
 
In the other -- most other forms of hypnosis, you get to control the 
environment.  A therapist has his office.  You’re coming to my 
territory.  You’re coming to my world hence my rules apply but 
times when it’s come to you as a therapist.  Really the scene has 
already been set.  Stage hypnosis is the same thing.   
 
Anthony: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
The stage is set for you already.  It’s a really relatively a no brainer.  
A complete novice at stage hypnosis could do an amazing show if 
he just has a bit of fun with people.  Because again the context is so 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
177 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
hypnotic that they basically have to do anti-hypnosis to make it fail.  
The street is very different.  You have to create that for yourself.  So 
if you can do it in the streets, you can basically do it anywhere.  
That’s really why I like the idea of street hypnosis.  Plus of course a 
whole bunch of you started getting business from people yesterday 
as well.  Saying I want to stop smoking.  I want to lose weight.  Give 
me your card.  I want to work with you.  And those of you who are 
hypnotherapists, honestly this is one of the easiest ways of getting 
clients.  You’re having some fun. You’re out one night and -- I mean 
I did this by accident once.   
 
This is how I came across doing street hypnosis.  I was with a bunch 
of friends.  Some of you heard this story already.  We’re in a bar or 
nightclub with loud music and a friend did the whole, oh, I don’t 
believe in hypnosis thing.  I said, oh really?  Come up.  And I’m 
sweating like a big like pig, oh, I hope this works.  I didn’t even do 
anything that much.  I think I did eye lock, which no one saw, of 
course.  Just two friends chatting, it was dark, of course.  And then 
the other one was the arm bar and suddenly, wham, a crowd came 
around.  A million questions started coming out.  And I’m sitting 
down at a desk and a queue starts forming around the desk.  I’m 
serious.  There’s a queue.  I’m like, am I open for business?  What 
the hell?  And I filled my appointment book that night, right?   
 
This is just to give you some ideas of where you can go with this.  
You can be a force for good in people’s lives.  I think Alex and -- 
 
Audience Member: Bob. 
 
Igor: 
Bob.  Thank you.  A little brain moment, Alex and Bob were telling 
us earlier how they, they fixed some girl’s claustrophobia in front of 
a skeptical doctor.  Oh, this stuff won’t work. Five minutes later, ten 
minutes later, however long it took, he’s going, I can’t believe this.  
So do you think your ability to get customers that way would 
increase or decrease as a result of what you’re doing?   
 
Plus of course, your skills increase, right?  How many novices are 
here in terms of haven’t really done hypnosis before?  Quite a few 
of you, right?  So you really jumped into the deep end, which I 
respect you for, by the way.  This is a really good way to give good 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

hypnosis, a great way to get a good hypnosis when I first started -- 
again, I know the same for you. 
 
Anthony: 
Exactly the same. 
 
Igor: 
I was begging for clients.  Going where do I get clients?  Then 
someone told me the reason a hypnotherapist’s practice is called a 
private practice is so you can practice in private.  All right.  This is a 
great way of doing low level things, getting used to the whole 
hypnotic process without having to delve too much into someone’s 
mind and clean up stuff.  Gets you very used to running the 
hypnotic show.  Shall we say that?  The whole experience, cutting 
your teeth as a good hypnotist so when you do good work, it’s 
there for you already.  Does that kind of make sense to you guys?   
 
So what we’re going to do now is enhance your portfolio a little bit.  
The first thing we want to do is -- well, we may as well get back into 
the whole performance mode.  So let’s get all these chairs off to the 
side and then we’ll come back and start having exercises.   
 
 
Fractionation 
 
Igor: 
Can I have a volunteer please?  Thank you very much, sir.  Come 
over here, all right.  Okay, I want you guys to just watch his level of 
attention.  Remember when we had the scale of one to ten 
yesterday?  Where is he right now? 
 
Audience Member: Six, five. 
 
Igor: 
Somewhere in the middle, right?  He’s not inattentive but he’s not 
as focused as he could be, right?  “So look at me and sleep all the 
way, deeper, deeper, deeper.  Relaxing, that’s it, very good.  Letting 
go, going deeper and deeper.  The deeper you go, the better you 
feel.  Every time you hear me say the word sleep, you can close 
your eyes and go to a state as deep as this or even deeper.  Nod 
your head if you understand.  That’s right.  Every time I say the 
word sleep, you just close your eyes and go to a state as deep as 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
179 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
this or even -- that’s right even deeper.  Nod your head if you 
understand that. Very good. 
 
“In a moment I’ll count, you know what?  I won’t count at all.  In a 
moment I’ll tell you to open your eyes and you’ll feel wide awake.  
Remembering that as soon as you hear me say the word sleep, just 
close your eyes and go to a stage as deep as this or even deeper.  
Ready?  Open your eyes.” 
 
Where is the attention now?  Where?   
 
Audience Member:  Eight. 
 
Igor: 
Eight?  “Okay, look at me and sleep all the way.  That’s it even 
better, even deeper now.  You’re doing a great job.  Look at that.  
Your own conscious mind is learning things at a fast rate than you 
can even imagine which must mean that things are happening to 
you as a hypnotist that you can’t even think of yet.  Meanwhile of 
course the same thing continues to go deeper and deeper each 
time, easier and easier each time.  Open your eyes and look at me.”  
 
Where’s the attention now? 
 
Audience Member: Higher? 
 
Igor: 
Getting higher, right? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
“And sleep, all the way, deeper, deeper, deeper still. That’s right, 
deeper still, arm out, strong and rigid, stiff and rigid like an iron bar.  
Make it stiff and rigid.  Feel that hand.  Make it strong. That’s it. 
Feel it getting stronger and stronger.  There you go.  Feel it getting 
stronger and stronger.  Feel that resistance getting stronger and 
stronger as you feel better inside here stronger and stronger here 
as you feel better inside here stronger and stronger here as you feel 
better inside here.  So strong that it feels like an iron bar.  Feel it 
becoming stiff and rigid like an iron bar.  That’s it.  Feel it becoming 
stiff and rigid like an iron bar as you become more and more 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

comfortable and go deeper into trance.  Stiff and rigid like an iron 
bar comfortable inside here.   
 
“And when you know you can’t bend it, just try it.  Go ahead and 
try.  Oh, you can do better than that.  That’s it.  There you go.  And 
then release it all the way and go even deeper ten times deeper 
now.  You did a great job.  Thank you for being a fantastic 
volunteer.  And as a thank you for being a great volunteer, I’d like 
your unconscious mind to give you a gift right now.  I’d like for you 
to find a secret pathway inside your mind so you can access trances 
as deep as this even deeper each time.  Your own private journey of 
exploration something that can last the rest of your life giving you 
amazing experiences, great insight and fantastic changes.  That’s 
right.  There you go.   
 
“In a moment, I’ll count from one to three.  On the count of three, 
open your eyes feeling totally refreshed, alert, simply fantastic.  
One, coming up slowly, two, take a deep, deep breath in.  And 
three, eyes open, wide awake, feeling simply fantastic.  How you 
doing?”  Give him a nice round of applause. 
 
Audience Member: Wow. 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, that’s by the way the person who came up from yesterday.  I 
can’t be hypnotized so I’m sorry if I’ve failed you. 
 
Audience Member:  I was worried but I wanted it.  Thank goodness. 
 
Igor: 
So what is that happening?  Did you guys notice something 
changing with each -- we repeated the same pattern, didn’t we?  
What happened each time we repeated the same pattern? 
 
Audience Member: It was deeper. 
 
Igor: 
It was deeper.  You see the focus intensify, yes?  Could you see 
what Anthony was talking about in terms of that blankness of 
expression?  It’s almost like you can see there’s fewer thoughts in 
his mind just by expression in his face.  Could you all see that?   
 
Audience Member: Definitely. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
181 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Igor: 
Do you notice his eyes changing in term of not just the visual focus 
but there’s like there’s more tearing of the eyes, it’s more 
defocusing of the eyes in terms of he’s not looking as attentively 
but he is still very attentive.  Does that kind of make sense?  These 
are strange things to describe because it’s not something that we 
experience every day. 
 
So the process we’ve been using is called fractionation.  A lot of you 
will be familiar with that it’s a very common technique in hypnosis.  
It’s very, very powerful, And you guys are going to have a chance at 
this in a moment.  The reason I want to show it to you this way is 
because it answers some of the questions you guys had yesterday.  
What if this fails, what if this fails, right?  One of the simplest 
answers to all those questions is, I like to call it, wash, rinse, repeat, 
right.  Clear the slate, you wash, you put them back in trance, rinse, 
clear out their minds say forget that and now it’s going to do it 
again, go deeper, even better and then repeat and do it again. 
 
I was working with another hypnotist,  we were just sharing ideas 
and a client came in and had no idea what hit him because there’s 
two hypnotist going at the same time, anyway, so he was doing 
basically the arm bar. Right?  He just said, sleep, boom, arm bar. 
Didn’t work, so he goes down, sleep, boom, arm bar, didn’t work.  
Again down, he did it four, five, six times there was a point I was 
getting embarrassed and like dude leave him alone, it’s okay you 
know.   
 
But eventually you could see the guy just went, “Ahh, fine 
whatever.” And the arm locked and at that point the whole 
hypnotic routine thing became a breeze because he found that 
point at which he could release into the whole process, at which he 
could go along with what’s happening without actually trying to 
make it happen or resist it.  That little, you know, there’s a bounce 
point where hypnosis actually occurs.  Does that make sense to you 
guys? 
Audience Member: Yes. 
Igor: 
So it’s a very powerful thing but it’s very easy to do.  The suggestion 
is very simple.  You’re in trance, you know, at the signal it could be 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
182 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
a touch to the shoulder or count one, two or just open your eyes.  
You’ll open your eyes and feel awake.  I don’t like the sound that 
they will be awake just feel awake some ambiguity there, right?  
But of course when I say the word sleep or sleep in this context 
you’ll close your eyes and go as deep as this or even deeper.   
Easy, okay, what I want you to do now is do that with a partner.  
Whatever induction you use whether it’s an instant induction or the 
hand induction or the hand lift induction or a conversion induction I 
don’t care, just put them in a trance as quickly as possible and run 
through four cycles of fractionation.  At the end of which do some 
simple task like an eye lock or arm levitation or an arm lock as a 
simple test that something has happened right? 
Anthony: 
And again we’re going to get -- you heard Igor’s language there it is 
pretty straightforward.  I just find when they’re -- if you just close 
your eyes, put your head forward, in this position this is your 
opportunity to really dish out the suggestions for exactly what you 
want to do and what’s going to occur.  So be in this position say, “In 
a moment I am going to ask you open your eyes I’m going to ask 
you to open your eyes, your eyes are open and I’ll say close your 
eyes, your eyes will close and you’ll go twice as deeply into hypnosis 
and twice as deeply relax. Just open your eyes, look up here and 
just close your eyes and sleep.  So one, two wide awake.”  
So obviously I’d run through that but I -- when I -- I tend to have 
that sort of control so I’m going to do this, I’m going to do that and 
that’s what’s going to happen.  “Just look up here” and I will 
eventually give him a second or two seconds to re-orientate and 
then, “Just close your eyes and sleep.” And I’m not going to leave it 
to chance.  I find it, again, a lot of beginners when they set up a 
post hypnotic suggestion like this, sort of say, close your eyes, and it 
will probably still work, don’t leave any room for maneuver or any 
room for chance. You know, look up here, open your eyes and back, 
close your eyes and give him another tap when he goes deeper or a 
little tap on the shoulder that kind of thing.  Let’s get to it. 
Igor: 
So how was that? Did you have fun? 
Audience Member: Yes.

Igor: 
Interesting? How much better are you today than you were 
yesterday? 
Audience Member: Lots. 
Igor: 
That’s kind of weird isn’t it?  It kind of got smoother and easier. 
Audience Member: Sure did. 
Igor: 
So Anthony do you want to take over the next phase? 
 
 
Fractionation Routines 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah okay, come up here.  That was me asking you if you wanted to 
volunteer.  Take a seat. 
Audience Member: Take a seat. 
Anthony: 
So we start to talk about fractionation there and what you’ve 
demonstrated is outlined pretty clearly in Elman’s wonderful book 
Hypnotherapy.  Try and get use to this idea of just phrasing those 
suggestions so what your saying is going to happen is set just ever 
so slightly in the future and then is realized. 
 
In a moment I’m going to ask you to do this and then you’ll open 
your eyes then I’ll ask you to do this and this will happen and this is 
what will occur  you will go twice as deep so just get use to using 
that kind of language.  Now I’m going to show you a couple of other 
ways of fractionating.  If you -- you still see okay there?  You want 
to just step back in with me. 
Audience Member: Move over here? 
Anthony: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you sit on that chair, it will be fine. This isn’t 
part of the compliance test. 
Igor: 
This is the hypno chair.  I feel it every time I sit on it. 
Anthony: 
Alright let’s just bring this back to what we taught you yesterday in 
terms of these set piece exercises and again I know some of you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
184 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
have already seen how to use this as an induction but I’m going to 
do the same thing but to me this built in fractionation.  I’ll then just 
demonstrate another induction; this is in fact my father’s induction, 
which also has built in fractionation, just so you get a little 
flexibility, okay? You happy to be hypnotized? 
Audience Member: Absolutely. 
Anthony: 
Yeah, what’s your name again? 
Audience Member: Michael. 
Anthony: 
Michael. What I’d like you to do first off Michael, couple of simply 
exercises to ease your concentration and imagination, I’m sure 
you’ve got an abundance of both.  So put your hands out in front of 
you if you would, like this and just clasp them together nice and 
tight so that your palms are together and your thumbs are crossed.  
Bend your elbows like your making that desperate prayer and put 
your first fingers up about an inch apart -- about an inch apart look 
at the gap between your fingers because in a moment they will 
touch just like they’re powerful magnets when they touch.  You can 
just allow your eyes to close and sleep now and relax.   
 
Deeper, deeper, down, you will not fall off the chair, you’re safe, 
you will be protected.  In a moment I’ll say one, two wide awake 
when I say one, two wide awake your eyes will open, you’ll be 
ready for the next exercise.  Want you wide awake, excellent. Now 
that shows me you can concentrate.  Now I’m going to ask you to 
concentrate in the same way but to use your imagination a little 
more.  We’ll ask you to close your eyes in advance.  Is that okay 
with you? 
 
I’ll show you what we’re going to do and we’ll do it.  I’ll ask you to 
place your hands out imagining there’s a magnet here and here.  
They’ll move together automatically and when they touch you can 
go straight back into that comfortable place, okay?  So arms out in 
front of you about six inches apart.  Look at the gap between your 
hands, get a clear picture of your hands stuck out, they’re just a 
little bit further apart, that’s right, clear picture of your hands stuck 
out. Now close your eyes Michael, with your eyes closed imaging 
those magnets on the palms of the hands being pulled together 
now.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
185 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Closer and closer you may feel that force increasing, that’s right, 
fingers twitching, hands shaking, closer and closer and closer and 
closer and when they touch that’s your signal.  Your neck can relax 
your shoulders can relax and you can go deep asleep once again, 
deep asleep, now sleep, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper down, 
deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper.  In a moment I’m going 
to say those words one, two wide awake when I do your eyes will 
open and you’ll be ready to be hypnotized, nod your head if you 
understand.   Want you wide awake.  Excellent, thanks for doing 
that mate. 
Just look up here with your hands.  Look at that hand the lines on it 
there one spot right now your hands going to begin to move 
towards your face, it does, you become aware of your eyes, you 
notice your eyes, close your eyes and sleep and relax deeper and 
deeper to sleep now.  Again I’ll ask you in a moment to open your 
eyes when I do just open your eyes look up at my finger, when I say 
close your eyes, your eyes will close and you will go twice as deeply 
down in hypnosis.   
Letting go for a time, letting go of you interdictions allowing your 
conscience mind to do its wondering and just drift off somewhere 
else entirely.  As your unconscious mind, your creative mind 
assumes complete responsibility.  So just open your eyes for me; 
look up here and just close your eyes and sleep twice as deep, 
deeper, deeper, deeper, down now.  Just open your eyes look up 
here; close your eyes, sleep, deeper, deeper, down.  You will not fall 
off the chair.   
Open your eyes look up one more time twice as deep a sleep, 
deeper, deeper, deeper, down now, sinking, floating, drifting to 
sleep, a blissful place, deeper, deeper, down now as I speak to the 
group.  Deeper, deeper, down picture a zero in your mind’s eye and 
just in your mind just very slowly start counting from five down to 
zero.  You’ll drift toward that zero.  When you get to zero you’ll drift 
right through the center of it into a profound state of hypnosis, a 
deep profound state of hypnosis.  Just start counting down in your 
mind you will not fall off the chair as I speak to the group. 
So again I am using exactly the same exercises as we used as an 
exercise in concentration.  All I’m doing this time is I’m using it as an 
induction. Alright? But I’m not actually testing my work because I 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
186 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
keep going on about testing your work.  If I’m going to use these for 
like a series of inductions that go on tested, for very often, because 
I’ve gone for it, I know that everything isn’t relying on that first 
induction really sticking and setting in. 
But I’ve got no worries. I’ve got no concerns because I know the 
real induction is still to come so you can do just a series of 
inductions and again have your fractionation just built in that way. 
Okay?   
Now I’m going to demonstrate another technique now.  It’s called a 
Jacquin power lift, simply because my father invented it and it’s got 
a number of principles.   
We’ve spoken about rehearsal and we’ve spoken about the patent 
interrupt and we spoken about, you know, you’ve seen eagle quite 
a few times just sleep, just a pure power induction based on word.  
This induction combines all of that but adds fractionation built in, 
okay?   
So I’ll count to five and at five you will be back in the room wide 
awake and alert bringing back that blissful feeling.  So one, feeling 
wonderful, two, feel that surge of energy as you sit up, three, take 
that deep breath Michael, feel your chest, four, your head wash 
through with cool spring water and five, back in the room feeling 
great.  Feeling good?  
Audience Member: Absolutely. 
Anthony: 
 
Good man.  Okay are you left handed or right handed? 
Audience Member: Right. 
Anthony: 
 
Okay can I borrow that arm? 
Audience Member: Sure. 
Anthony: 
Alright just put it on your lap for a moment.  What I want to do is 
this.  In a moment I’ll take hold of your wrist and I’ll lift it when it 
gets to about here you can just allow your eyes to close, I’ll push it 
down and your eyes will open.  I’ll lift it up, your eyes will close, I’ll 
push it down, your eyes will open, that’s all we’re going to do. Is 
that okay with you?

Audience Member: That’s fine. 
Anthony: 
Okay just fix your eyes on a spot on the carpet or something.  Keep 
your eyes fixed on that spot, you don’t have to say anything or do 
anything now.  I’m going to take hold of your wrist and lift it up 
when it gets to a certain point you can just allow your eyes to close, 
that’s right.  I’ll push your arm down and your eyes open.  I’ll lift it 
up your eyes will close, that’s right and I’ll push it down your eyes 
open as you continue to relax.   
This time as the wrist lifts up and your eyes close feel that wrist 
getting stiffer now.  Your forearm getting tighter -- forearm getting 
tighter, that fist stiffer and stiffer, your elbow locking, your bicep 
right up into your shoulder, every muscle nerve and fiber in that 
arm getting stiffer and stiffer, tighter and tighter and tighter as it 
locks completely now.  
 
Go deeply down into hypnosis again see that zero and begin drifting 
toward it now.  Five, deeper sleep, four, deeper and deeper, three, 
letting go, two, as that arm locks completely, one, see that giant 
zero now looking forward to drifting into that profoundly blissful 
place.  Zero all the way through now.  In a moment I’m going to 
touch you on the back of the hand when I touch you on the back of 
the hand it’s going to start to lift up toward your face, it’s going to 
start to get lighter and lighter and slowly move up toward your 
face.   
There is nothing that you can do about it but as it lifts you’ll enjoy 
this unusually sense of well-being, this growing sense of well-being, 
an unusual feeling.  And I came across this idea Michael, this is 
something that you would love to feel differently about something 
that if you could just laugh about it, smile about it you would be 
better off, that’s right.  As that hand moves toward your face it’s 
going to start to seem funny to you for some unknown reason, it’s 
going to get closer and closer and closer, that chuckle is going to 
turn into a laugh, that’s right.   
And you’re going to look at this thing from five miles up then fifty 
miles up and you’re going to see it in its true perspective.  Not just 
your life, your town, your country, in fact you could stay in the 
context of the planet. You’re not going to fall off the chair. This is 
ridiculous to you and as you laugh it’s going to get funnier and 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
188 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
funnier and funnier and funnier.  You’re going to laugh with 
complete abandon. 
You even try and take this seriously it will never bother you again; 
all you will be able to do is laugh.  As you laugh there is a 
fundamental learning going on in your mind, that’s right.  And that’s 
that you can change the way you think, change the way you feel, 
change the way you respond in an instant.  You can literally decide 
to change your mind.  And I’ll show you how it is. In a moment, I’m 
going to clap my hands. You’re going to start laughing like that posh 
old lady. No way, not no way, it’s just you can’t help it, it feels even 
better.   
I’ll clap again you’ll laugh like a laughing policemen.  There is 
nothing you can do about it funnier and funnier and funnier and 
funnier.  This is ridiculous to you.  Now in a moment what I’m going 
to do is I’m going to touch that arm and you can have all those good 
feelings where there’s good chemical coursing through your brain, 
all that laughter, all that wonderful feeling there but you can just 
stop laughing now and sleep. Go deeply, deeply, down to sleep, 
deep a sleep now, deeply.  This arm can stay locked completely 
there and that feeling is going to spread over your shoulders to 
your neck into your other arm.  It’s going to spread all the way 
down, all the way down into that other arm.  Your fists are going to 
form; you even try to move those arms you will find it’s impossible.  
Put some effort in, try and move them, try and lift them you just 
fight those muscles getting tighter. 
When I clap my hands, next your entire body will be statued.  You 
entire body is made of marble all you can move is your head.  All 
you can move is your head, you try and move any other muscle 
even a toe, you try stand up from that chair, all that will move is 
your head. Your head will nod automatically when that is 
understood.  That’s right now just open your eyes for me. Yeah, you 
can move your head, you can look at me.  How are you doing? 
Audience Member: Good. 
Anthony: 
 
Can you shake my hand?  Can you shake my hand?   
Audience Member: No.

Anthony: 
I tell you what, are you sure about that? Let’s make it more 
interesting.  Try and take that off of me. Put some effort in it. I 
mean, this is like the iPhone4 thing.  I tell you what if you can touch 
it you can have it.  I mean it. You’ve got 30, 40 witnesses if you can 
touch that you can have it.  I know its Igor’s phone but it doesn’t 
matter. He’s got a lot of good numbers in there. 
 
Okay, what I’d like you to do is sleep and relax. Let the muscle 
tension disappear from your body where the tension disappears 
with a good feeling, that rush of chemicals more of that laughter, 
that’s right.  It’s coursing through your body now, coursing through 
your body.  These can relax, your arms can relax.  In a moment I will 
say one, two wide awake your eyes will open, you’ll believe 
everything is back to normal but for some unknown reason you will 
no longer be able to remember your name, just for a time you can 
have this experience of complete amnesia for your name. It is 
rubbed out, rubbed off the blackboard, it is gone just for a time. 
The harder you try to say it, speak it, think it the more distant it will 
become, gone, disappeared just for a time.  This is going to seem 
amusing to you, you won’t know why, one, two wide awake.  Can 
you shake my hand?  Good man, what’s your name I’m terrible with 
names? 
Audience Member: Come on man. 
Anthony: 
I know you’re under pressure, you’re on the spot. The cameras are 
rolling. 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
Anthony: 
What’s your name?  Sleep, relax deeper, deeper down.  Your name 
is Jennie Camelhumper III.  Your name is Jennie Camelhumper III it’s 
entirely normal to you.  You’re from a long line of Camelhumper’s.  
You want to be called Jennie from now on.  You have got to 
introduce yourself to 10 people as Jennie.  Anyone laughs at your 
name you get pissed off you will not get violent but you will be 
angry if anyone laughs at your name.  Cause your from a long line of 
Camelhumper’s. Nod your head when you understand, one, two 
wide awake.  Hey what’s your name? 
Audience Member: Jennie Camelhumper III. 
Anthony: 
Jennie Camelhumper.  You’re from a long line of Camelhumper’s?

Audience Member: I am yes. 
Anthony: 
Okay cool.  Introduce yourself, I mean, go for it. 
Audience Member: Hi, I’m Jennie Camelhumper III.   
Audience Member: How are you doing Jennie? 
Audience Member: Nice, thank you. I love being called Jennie. I’m Jennie Camelhumper 
III. 
Audience Member: Pleased to meet you Jennie. 
Audience Member: Thank you.   I’m Jennie Camelhumper III.  How are you doing?  You 
think that’s funny? 
Anthony: 
Sir, what’s happening here? 
Audience Member: What’s so funny? He’s laughing at me. I just introduced myself to 
him, Jennie Camelhumper III and he started this. Some manners, 
please. 
Anthony: 
I tell you what come and sit down, come and sit down.  Just take a 
seat down there if you would, just take a seat down there, that’s 
right.  I tell you what just look here okay just look here.  You 
hypnotized, you’re not hypnotized, sleep now deeper, deeper, 
deeper, deeper, deeper.  You will not fall off the chairs like you 
have a seatbelt on you. You will not fall off the chair you are 
perfectly safe.  And relax every single thing that I say to you now 
will become your reality instantly and immediately in the moment 
that I say it.  Everything I say to you will be your reality because you 
have a super powerful creative mind that is working for you.  
Deeper and deeper down now.   
 
In a moment when I say one, two wide awake your eyes will open 
again.  Again you will believe everything is back to normal but you 
will have lost the ability to deal with numbers, lost the ability to 
count.  You try and count and it will be a random string of numbers. 
You lost all ability with numbers.  You will feel like you are doing 
quite well but of course you will be completely wrong. 
 
You’ve lost your ability to count one, two wide awake.  How many 
fingers do I got there?   
Audience Member: Seven.

Anthony: 
About seven.  Just count them for me if you would. 
Audience Member: Three, eight, six -- 
Anthony: 
You’re doing well. 
Audience Member: Two and seven. 
Anthony: 
Sleep and relax deeper, deeper, deeper down now.  When I say 
one, two, wide awake, your eyes will open and you will be the 
world’s biggest liar.  You are the biggest liar on this planet and 
everything is a lie and everything that comes out of your mouth is 
complete untruth.  Each untruth will be bigger than the last.  Nod 
your head when you understand.   
 
One, two wide awake, sorry what size feet you got? 
Audience Member: Size 20. 
Anthony: 
Size 20.  
Audience Member: Yeah. 
Anthony:

Audience Member: Not telling. 
Anthony: 
Oh, you’re not telling, okay, why, okay is it a secret? 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
Anthony: 
Yeah, okay.  Sleep, relax, sleep deeper, deeper down now.  You are 
a truth teller, you are a truth teller.  You can only speak the truth 
you have absolute conviction; you can only speak the truth.  For 
everything that comes out of your mouth is the absolute truth.  Nod 
your head when I say you’re on board, one, two wide awake.   What 
size feet you got? 
Audience Member: 10. 
Anthony: 
How many kids you got? 
Audience Member: None. 
Anthony: 
None. Okay.  How old are you? 
Audience Member: 48. 
Anthony: 
Okay what is your biggest regret?  Sleep deeper, deeper, deeper, 
deeper, deeper, deeper down.  I’m not going to do that to my 
friend.  Deeper, deeper down now sinking and floating and drifting 
down to sleep, let go for a time.  Drift back into that blissful place 
through that zero five, four, three, two, one.  Now from today 
Michael, your name’s Michael, whenever you wish to return in this 
profound state of hypnosis, it will be easy for you and anytime it’s 
safe and appropriate it will be easy for you to do this. 
 
All you need to do is sit quietly and repeat the word relax four times 
in your mind.  The fourth time you repeat that word you will 
instantly and immediately return to this state anytime its safe and 
appropriate to do so.  You know you could just hang out in this 
wonderful place of hypnosis and just chill out and relax.  But you 
can actively use your mind, actively use your imagination and direct 
that vast unconscious resource of yours all those years of 
experience towards your goals, towards the things you want to 
achieve. 
 
Now right now I know, I suspect you have a goal, something that 
you want to do in 2010 or 2011. A goal that you have that you are 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
193 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
determined to achieve.  If you can identify such a goal right now 
just nod your head for me and I want that creative mind to look and 
find the very next step, the very next thing that you are going to do, 
the action that you are going to take and when you found that 
again I want you to see yourself doing that. See yourself taking that 
step in fact go a little further still and see yourself enjoying the fact 
that you’ve done that and your now on route to that goal. 
 
It feels so great.  You are looking back to now and realizing that 
you’ve been thinking about something else entirely you’re just 
moving toward your goal.  Should you ever take yourself into 
hypnosis in this way you can’t get stuck in it. Should you need to re-
orientate suddenly for some reason then you would but to bring 
yourself back up in your own time feeling fantastic, wide awake and 
alert, ready to respond to any situation all you need to do is count 
from one to five in your head and you will be back up, wide awake 
and alert. 
 
Right now I’m going to count and on the count of five you will be 
back in the room wide, alert feeling fantastic, refreshed, revitalized 
with a fresh understanding of how you can use these techniques.  
 
So one, every muscle, nerve and fiber is coming alive, feeling the 
relaxation that blissful feeling as all the tension disappears, that’s 
right.  Two, feel a surge of energy pouring in now through fingers 
and toes, up arms, legs, spine, neck to the top of the head.  Three, 
take that deep breathe in fill your chest up with energy giving 
oxygen, you’re doing wonderfully.  Four, force it out, freedom, 
wash it free now, your eyes clearing, nose clear, throat clear, chest 
clear, stomach clear.  Five, eyes open wide awake.   
 
Thank you. Give him a round of applause.   
Igor: 
Alright guys, you ready to do that now? Why they laughing? 
Anthony: 
As ever, got slightly carried away there but if you can think back to 
the fractionation, hopefully you can see that you got flexibility with 
fractionation.  The main thing is to state your intentions. Realize 
that fractionation is just another suggestion.  Some of the thinking 
about the eyes open, eyes closed thing is that what you’re doing is 
kind of re-orientating the person or allowing them to just about re-
orientate and then pushing them back in again. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

To me that is very, very close to falling asleep at the wheel of a car 
where you’re just, “Nah I only got 20 miles to go, I know we 
shouldn’t and then you’re drifting off and you suddenly think, oh I 
still on the motor way.”  It’s the same kind of feeling where 
experienced subjects having been pulled up and then back in again, 
pulled up and I’m looking for that same kind of soft testing 
approach is if I’m saying twice as deep or twice as relaxed I’m just 
looking and he demonstrated it beautifully, the second time he got 
fractionated you it was like, boom, your head just went, your neck 
just went, it was lowered down. Your back was more kind of curved 
and relaxed. And I just thought he’s gotten there so I’m trying to 
grow in confidence in the subject when I’m fractionating.   
So you can do this, this in a different induction and a three stage 
fractionation and then add it up -- added on the eyes open, eyes 
closed thing.  We can build fractionation into a single induction and 
that’s what this is, sounds like a wrestling move it’s got a Jacquin 
power lift.  So that’s the induction my dad and I use in therapy.  
We’ve used it for 30,000 clients between us and so we use it in 
every single session. Bang. So there you go, a bit on fractionation. 
Igor: 
So we have about 20 minutes before the break so I think the best 
thing to do is go into find a partner do the whole thing again and 
this time we want to focus on number one, the fractionation 
through induction so before we did fractionation through re-
induction –  
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
Igor: 
-- sleep, sleep, sleep but now we want to create, should we say a 
covert fractionation by doing lots of little inductions.  Essentially do 
your test, your finger magnets, your hand magnets, if there is any 
other tests you know, feel free to throw those in there as well.  
Then add in at least one hand shake induction whether it’s just take 
the arm and lift it or it’s the hand shake and lift it or whatever 
variation that you want.  If you want to do several that’s fine too. 
Anthony: 
Yeah, you can use the thing that Igor showed you with the eyes.  
That could just easily be the induction.  You could just say I’m going 
to hypnotize you and this is how we are going to do it look at my 
finger now just close your eyes -- 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
195 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Right. 
Anthony: 
-- now in your mind you can say open your eyes and say the words 
deeper relax, deeper relax, close your eyes and go deeper relax, just 
enjoy the -- 
Igor: 
The point of it is, it’s time for you guys to start taking control of 
your hypnotic training so that you start making some stuff up.  You 
change the sequence for yourself; you add bits in to see what they 
feel like.  Let’s face it they are going to be so much in a trance 
anyway you could just lick your tongue and they’ll go down cause 
why not? Right? Because it is a simply association between I’m 
going to do this or this is going to happen and this is going to 
happen as a result.   
 
At the end of that whole process I would like you to do maybe five 
or six letters of fractionation.  You don’t really normally need that 
much but you might as well really zone them through the floor and 
have a good time with it.  I’d like you to do two things.  The first I 
want you to do is as you're going through the process of 
fractionation, I’d like you to present some positive suggestion for 
the person.  Just off-hand comment about them being a great 
hypnotist, having a great time, finding street hypnosis easy, you 
may as well present useful suggestions to plant seeds inside their 
minds.  But that could be secondary in terms of what your achieving 
so that is just stuff that you do as you go along.  Don’t focus on 
those too much.  I don’t want like an half an hour of thorough 
hypnotherapy -- 
Anthony: 
No, no, no but just never waste a trance state, a simply suggestion.  
From this point forward, fair enough you’ve gone through some 
routines with them, from this point forward when you are 
practicing techniques, get use to saying things like I’m going to 
bring you around, you are going to be in a perfect state for learning 
and absorbing information.  Tonight when you go to bed you will 
sleep wonderfully, assimilating everything that you have learned 
and ready for the next day, blah, blah, and blah, just two or three 
simple suggestions. 
Igor: 
And the key here is you don’t have to do them all at once.  In fact 
it’s better if you just throw one in, carry on with other stuff, 
another one in here, carry on with other stuff and that way even if 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
196 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
they over analyze one of them at some point they will forget some 
of them and they’ll still be nicely embedded in the unconscious.  
The second thing that I want you guys to do is at the tail end of your 
fractionation process, whatever methods you decide to use for it, I 
would like for you to go for two specific kinds of routines.  We’ve 
talked about this already but you may as well do it more efficiently 
now. 
 
The first routine I want you to do is a physical test, alright?  If you 
do a soft physical test first, like an arm levitation, that’s great but 
ultimately I want you to have a hard physical test like you can’t 
bend your arm. A bindery test -- 
Anthony: 
Yes, you cannot lift that hand, you’re stuck there it’s glued there. 
Igor: 
Exactly, then the second thing I want you to do is an emotional test.  
We had emotional experiences where you got to combine physical 
and emotional together but I want to have a clear emotional thing 
that’s demonstrative. So smiling is one but laughing is even better 
because it’s pretty much black or white, they’re either laughing or 
they’re not. 
 
So whether you choose laughter or something else I want it to be 
something where it is absolutely no doubt in your mind.  You 
absolutely got a physical response, you’ve absolutely got an 
emotional response and this will set you up for what we are doing 
after the lunch break.  Does that make sense to you guys?  Now you 
may have noticed I haven’t given you a specific technique to do or a 
specific processes to go through, right?  Now is the point where you 
are starting to combine your own experiences and re-combine 
them and you might see your subject does something and go I’ll run 
with that a little bit and use that as my fractionation. 
 
Or you may see a little twitch in the arm and go I was going to do 
the arm lock but now I’ll do arm levitation instead because I just 
saw that.  So I want you to start paying attention to your subjects 
and just go with that.  Do you remember when we worked over 
here and we would ask you where’s Lawrence at, where’s his 
tension level?  Right, if you only look for tension level in the number 
one to ten you’ll start to see other things happening and then that 
will be your cue from where you take it from there.  Does that kind 
of make sense to you guys? 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
197 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Don’t concern yourself too much.  The simple rule is five or six 
fractionations using specific different inductions while seating ideas 
that are positive for their life learning, being a great hypnotist and 
so on and at the end of that you are to put in a physical test of 
some sort followed by an emotional test of some sort so that 
you’ve kind of spanned that range relatively quickly.  Make sense?  
Alright, so we’ll give you five minutes apiece, you probably don’t 
need more than five minutes but we’ll make it seven actually 
because then you will have a nice meaty routine.  Fifteen minutes in 
total we’ll be back here to wrap it up for the break. Okay.

So before the break you had the chance to start practicing your 
routines in terms of finding your own order, finding your own mix, 
fractionating.  Let me ask you this, did you all noticed a change in 
their focus with each level of fractionation? Yes? Were looking for 
that? Did you all notice some kind of increase in unconscious 
signaling going on as you went through the fractionation, anything 
like twitching perhaps or perhaps finger movements or the eyes just 
having problems focusing, or eyes dilating, or they’re coming back 
with a very vacant look, waiting to find out with the next thing that 
should happened is, all these are kinds of signals that people are 
being very responsive to what you’re saying?

Did you all notice those kinds of signals occurring as you went 
through the inductions?  Did you all get a clear physical test with a 
clear response?  Yes?  Did you all do an emotional test with a clear 
emotional response?  Did you all find that easy to get?  Yes?  Right, 
well, a little more enthusiasm if possible, yes or no?  There’s one 
going kind of like “Wow, it’s easy to do all this stuff, I want real 
hypnosis”.  So what we’re going to do now is go from – what we’ll 
do in a moment before we get there is – we want to start taking 
those skills and taking it to the next level. 
 
How to start creating your routines out of it, how to take them 
different directions and really build up on it, how to make it really 
dramatic in terms of what people are seeing and what people are 
experiencing and so on, right?  Before we do that though, this is 
probably where I would have needed my flipchart, it doesn’t matter 
too much.  We can do it this way. 
 
 
Abreaction Drill 
 
Igor: 
We want to go through the abreactions drill. We talked yesterday 
about abreactions, really if you’re being respectful to someone and 
you’re treating them well, we’re looking out for safety and so on 
which we talk about yesterday.  Then there’s really nothing that can 
go wrong provided you’re being respectful of people.  That includes 
the surrounding audience as well.   
 
You don’t want to be annoying someone in the audience because, 
you want to bulldoze through what you want to do, right?  I mean 
that makes sense, doesn’t it? It’s just plain common sense.  So the 
only thing that could possibly go wrong inside of a session, other 
than that it doesn’t quite work how you want it to, which is really 
not a big deal, is that you might get an abreaction.  And remember, 
this is a very rare thing, unless you’re going after abreactions, which 
really, you shouldn’t be doing on the streets.  I have only seen – as I 
said, I’ve only seen two uncalled for abreactions.   
 
One was in the context of hypnotherapy training and that person 
was basically asking for free therapy.  And I was foolish enough to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
199 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
say yes, unconsciously of course.   And the other time it just 
occurred and that’s in 15 years of doing hypnosis.  I don’t know if 
you have similar numbers for you.   
 
Anthony: 
Absolutely I’ve never had someone have an abreaction in 
performance, but I’m prepared should that happen. I’ve had one so 
called sleeper we call it collateral hypnosis.  I was doing the stage 
show my final routine is –I’m surrounded by force field of chi, try to 
kick me in the balls.  And –  
 
Igor:  
My chi stronger!  
 
Anthony:  
A guy walks on the stage and says, “My wife’s gone into one.”  So 
I’m just finishing, so I’m like, I assumed she’d been on stage and I’d 
lost her.  She hadn’t, when I said one, two, three, four, five to 
everyone on stage, she just went, poof!  Out!  She wasn’t upset or 
distraught, but wouldn’t wake up, but we’ll come to that?  So I’ve 
never had an abreaction on the street or on stage.  No.   
 
Igor:  
We’ll deal with that before lunch today.  It’s actually relatively 
simple to deal with that sort of thing.   But really, these things are 
relatively straight forward to deal with provided you keep the first 
rule.  Now remember, what does an abreaction look like?  It’s not 
like “Umm, I’m little sad now.” 
 
 
That could turn into an abreaction. An abreaction is really, “Oh God, 
no!”  If anyone here had a slight emotional response, that’s typically 
the emotional response you’ll have when it actually happens, right?  
It catches you unawares, you don’t expect it, it’s a little bit 
shocking.  And here’s the first rule of abreaction, this is something 
that you want to burn into your minds, I’ll keep everything going 
well.   
 
The first rule of abreaction is stay calm, you’re going to stay calm, 
right?  You may even want to repeat it to yourself,“stay calm.”  
That’s not really convincing right now, “stay calm.”   
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.

Igor:  
That’s coming a little.  That’s like stay calm!  Its, “Stay calm,” 
whatever is happening in front of you, you have the tools, you have 
more than enough skills to deal with it.  You might as well see the 
abreaction, you just –  
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.    
 
Igor:  
Come on guys, you can do better than that.  You stay calm.  
 
Audience Member:  You stay calm.   
 
Igor: 
You want to have that conviction, because let’s face it, when there’s 
two of you in the relationship, one of you is abreacting, they’re not 
the one that’s going to have the conviction about staying calm, are 
they?  Their conviction is about freaking out and things going 
wrong.  Now, if you as a hypnotist join them, you’re going to have a 
very interesting party going on right now.  And it’s not one that’s 
going to end happily, right? 
 
 
So that’s your job, is to create the context.  Now, what kind of a 
context is going help someone get out of a bad place?  Let’s say 
they’ve just mentally taken a descent into hell, what kind of context 
is going to help them get out of it? 
 
Where you sit and tell them, “Fuck!  This is a bad place.”  Or do you 
want me go, “it’s all right, look I’m up here, come join me.”  Which 
one do you think is going to help them?  Part B, right?  So the very 
first rule of abreactions if you ever come across anything that’s a 
little bit spooky or scary, whatever it is, you just –  
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.   
 
Anthony:  
Another pay-off for staying calm is that when someone has an 
abreaction, you very often find their friend or their partner tries to 
drag you away.  And they’re like stop it now, and they just want rid 
of you.  If you’re still the expert and you’re still calm, then you’ve 
got a great opportunity to deal with this very, very quickly, you 
can’t deal with it if you’re being strong armed out of the bar, or you 
just – she’s scared of you now, leave her alone.

Igor: 
In the point of crisis, people always respond to the person who’s 
staying calm.  Because they looked like they know what they’re 
doing, that’s what people turn to.  The one that’s most stable.  So 
what are you going to do when someone starts freaking out?  
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.   
 
Igor: 
Very good.  The next thing is a very important rule.  It’s actually a 
negative, which you don’t hear me saying very often, but it makes a 
lot of sense.  The second rule of an abreaction, once you’re staying 
calm is, you don’t touch.  You don’t want to touch the person in 
case they start associating that touch to the state and then next 
time you go, “You okay?” and it just comes right back up again.  
Think of a touch as a tunnel, that can attach to whatever experience 
they’re having.  So then it’s like pulling Alice out of Wonderland and 
going “Ho, that’s okay.  Look at that hole.”   
 
Down you go again, right, which is not a nice thing, so you want to 
make sure you don’t touch the person.  You stay calm, you don’t 
touch.  It’s okay to touch afterwards once it’s all being resolve and 
so on, but whilst it’s happening, you’re hands off.  And this is very 
important specially for the more touchy or feely ones amongst us, 
we just want to go and give them a big hug and say “There, there 
it’s okay.  There, there.” Right?  And I’ve seen it happen where 
people do that quite successfully as well, it’s just you have to make 
sure you clean up the hug afterwards well as, whatever it is that 
just happened.  Does that make sense?  So you’re just adding an 
extra layer of work for yourselves.  Does that make sense? 
 
So, the first thing  you do when someone starts abreacting is?  
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.  
 
Igor: 
Then what do you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Don’t touch.   
 
Igor: 
Say that with a little bit more conviction, will you?  
 
Audience Member:  Don’t touch.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Igor: 
Because it’s very important that you don’t do that, and the next 
thing is you want to start taking control of the person’s experience.  
It’s very important to take control of that experience because they 
are not in control at that point, that’s what – they didn’t choose to 
have an abreaction, it’s just happening to them, and part of the fear 
response to that happening is that they feel out of control whilst it’s 
going on.  Does that kind of make sense to you guys?  So in order to 
suggest the experience away, you need to give them a process.  You 
can give them something that they can think of. So the first part of 
the process, the one I like, is just to clear their mind.  I mean, 
everyone try this for a moment.   
 
Think of someone or a situation you don’t like, right?  Think of 
something that might frighten you a little bit, specially like, Street 
Hypnosis, right? Something that you don’t like.  You can feel a little 
emotion, it’s not pleasant is it?   Yes?  Let’s just let that memory 
fade or that scene fade.  Let’s clear it from your mind.  You starting 
to feel a bit better, right?  Why is that?  Where attention goes, 
energy flows and all that sort of stuff, right?  So you stayed calm, 
you didn’t touch them, so the next thing you want to do is clear 
their mind.  You just tell them, the scene fades.   
 
Let the scene fade, let the scene fade.  And can repeat that, you 
may notice with the arm, I did not say, “Your arm is stiff now, test 
it.”  We repeat it, don’t we?   The scene fades, let the scene fade.  
The scene fades, that’s right.  Let that scene fade, make it fade, it’s 
fading now.   Do you see how that works?  So you clear their mind, 
what are you saying?  The scene fades, right?  What kind of thing do 
you say?   
 
Audience Member:  Scene fades.   
 
Igor: 
So you’re –  
 
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.   
 
Igor: 
Then what do you do?   
 
Audience Member: Don’t touch.

Igor: 
What do you say?  
 
Audience Member: The scene fades.   
 
Igor: 
I’m starting to feel a little bit better, I’m still kind of abreacting a 
little bit, so what do you say?   
 
Audience Member: Scene fades.   
 
Igor: 
C’mon, a little bit more conviction than that.   
 
Audience Member: Scene fades.  
 
Igor: 
Okay because you have to be the one that’s in-charge.  You just say 
“scene fades.”   Is it likely to fade?  No.  They need to have more 
faith in what you’re saying than what they’re experiencing, which 
means you have to say that scene fades, that’s right.   The scene is 
fading, fading, fading, going.  Now other thing that’s nice to say and 
it’s a good thing to weave in at the same time, especially at the end 
of the whole thing is, you’re safe.  Now sometimes people – I don’t 
know if I’m safe ‘cause it’s an open ended sort of thing.  But 
remember how when we did deepening and said feel the touch, 
you go deeper, this happens, you go deeper.  Or all those sort of 
associations when you do this, something else will happen.   
 
You know the law of associations, it’s kind of a bizarre thing that the 
unconscious mind is more likely – will accept a suggestion that’s 
attached to something else, rather than free floating on its own.   
So if you want to make someone feel safe, then you may as well 
give them something to attach it to.  So even if they’re sitting down 
somewhere, just say feel the chair, it’s something they can verify 
and know you’re safe.   Feel the chair, you’re safe, feel the chair, 
you’re safe. Does that make sense?  If they are standing of course, 
they’re not going to be feeling the chair, you have some other –  
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, feel your feet on the floor.   
 
Igor: 
Right.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Anthony:  
Just a bit more body awareness, because at the moment they’re 
just feeling emotion.   
 
Igor: 
Exactly.  So you want to get them from just pure sensation and from 
that, they can start building the sense of safety.  So let’s assume 
that they’re sitting down and all you’re going to say is, “Feel the 
chair, you’re safe.”  So what kind of things you might say?   
 
Audience Member: Feel the chair, you’re safe.   
 
Igor: 
Say again.  
 
Audience Member:  Feel the chair, you’re safe.   
 
Igor: 
Okay and at that point it’s all over, you can bring them back out of 
trance and we’ll deal with that in a moment.   So just make sure you 
can understand what we’re doing here. I’m your client, I’m in a 
trance, I’m having a great time, suddenly “Oh my God!” What do 
you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.  
 
Igor: 
What don’t you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Don’t touch.   
 
Igor: 
What happens next?  
 
Audience Member: Scene fades.  
 
Igor: 
And I’m feeling like “Oh, okay.  It’s kind of –  but not really I’m not –  
 
Audience Member: Scene fades.   
 
Igor: 
I’m feeling a little bit better.   
 
Audience Member:  Scene fades.  
 
Anthony:  
Throw yourself in the chair.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
205 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
And then once I feel calmer now, now what do you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Feel the chair. 
 
Igor: 
So you feel the chair, know you’re safe, right?  Say that again, 
someone’s going “I’m a little better now, but I don’t know, that was 
a terrible experience,” so you say?  
 
Audience Member:  Feel the chair, know you’re safe.   
 
Igor: 
And again, just for the hell of it.  
 
Audience Member: Feel the chair, know you’re safe.   
 
Igor: 
Oh, I’m so much better.  So what do you do now?  You bring them 
back.   You count them out.  And then when you count them out, 
what I like to do is just put in a suggestion for amnesia, for 
forgetting and basically saying that the unconscious mind can let 
that experience fade away, lock it away, somewhere safely.  You 
can remember as much or as little as you need to stay safe, right?   
 
 
Because that gives the unconscious mind freedom to basically lock 
it up again, so the person doesn’t have to deal with it again until 
they’re ready, or to remember parts of it that aren’t frightening so 
they have a choice about when and whether they want to deal with 
it.   
 
This is very important, when they’re back you don’t go “Oh, my God 
man, are you okay?  You look like you’re freaking out man!”  I was 
like, I was so concerned, you’re messed up!” Right? Would you say 
that to someone?   
 
Audience Member:  No.  
 
Igor: 
Why?   
 
Anthony:  
Because they’re suggestible.  
 
Igor: 
Exactly.  It’s a suggestion, you’re going to dump them right back in.  
It’s like saying “Now that I’ve saved you. Back in the sharks you go, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
206 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
unlucky.”  There’s blood there. So what you are going to do is 
basically – you do not want to reference what’s just happened, 
other than the vaguest sense and the vaguest of terms.  They come 
back and you say, hey come back, feeling safe, back to the world.  
You’re back in control, everything is in your control, and everything 
is going well.  “How are you doing?” “Yeah that was quite 
something.”  “Yeah, you had quite an experience, didn’t you?”  
“Yeah, well what was that?”   
 
“It’s not really for me to say. All I know is that if ever you’re going to  
deal with it, here’s my card, you can come in and we’ll do this as a 
professional thing. And if not that’s fine too, I mean right now, 
you’re safe and you know it, right?”  “Yes”, so I’m going to do a lot 
of indirect suggesting.  You know you’re safe, you know it right? 
Yes.  I’m going to check that they’re being congruent about it.  I’m 
not going to let them leave my presence until I feel that stability is 
there again, so I can let them go off and go back to their day again, 
make sense?  And at that point I’ll do everything, I’ll touch them,  I 
might mention some things that I talked about before, anything 
that might accidentally trigger it off, I’ll put into the conversation, 
even the tone of voice I had, during the whole process because I 
want to make sure that nothing will accidentally trigger it off once 
I’m gone.  Does that kind of make sense to you guys?   So just to 
test, to make sure that we’re on the same page, “I’m having an 
abreaction and what do you do?”  
 
Audience Member: Stay calm.  Don’t touch.  Scene fades.  Feel the chair. 
 
Igor: 
And then?  
 
Audience Member:  Bring them back.   
 
Igor: 
Okay, that was almost good except that you’re like “Bring them 
back, I feel safe.” I don’t really feel convince that you could help run 
this experience for me, like I’m really freaking out right now.  And I 
need someone to really have more energy than my problem has, 
right?  Because if it’s like a little problem, you can come out of the 
problem now.  I believe in you, yes.  Yes I believe in all of you.  
You’re a great hypnotist and I believe in your skills, do you believe 
me?   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
207 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
As a hypnotist, your subject is looking to you to have more power 
than their problem has.  Not power over them but more power 
than their problem has because that’s kind of like “I’m going where 
the powers is” because that’s what I need right now.  So if you’re 
only like okay, the scene fades. “Okay, scene fades, scene fades,” all 
you’re going to do is just say, my problem is so big that even a 
professional hypnotist can’t get through it.  You see what I mean by 
that?  So I need conviction, I need energy and honestly we’re not 
leaving this room until I get both.  And those of you who’ve trained 
with me before in the hypnotherapy training right, would it be fair 
to say that I’m not lying right now?  
 
Audience Member:  Yes.  
 
Igor:  
I’m quite happy sitting for an hour to do this, just warning you right 
now.  I’ll sit here for an hour until I know that you can deal with 
people very safely and get them out of their trouble when you need 
to.  So I’m having abreaction, what do you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.  
 
Igor:  
What don’t you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Don’t touch! 
 
Igor:  
What do you do?  What do you say?   
 
Audience Member:  Scene fades.   
 
Igor: 
Now I believe you. I’m getting a little better but do it again.  
 
Audience Member: Scene fades.  
 
Igor: 
Okay the scene is gone but I don’t know what just happened to me.  
 
Audience Member:  Feel your chair. 
 
Igor: 
Okay I’m feeling a bit better now, but I still have a little bit of that 
doubt.

Audience Member:  Feel you’re safe.  
 
Igor: 
Okay, now I believe you, now what do you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Bring them back.  
 
Igor: 
Okay, now I think I believe you a little bit, what happened?  What 
was that, what was happened to me?  I don’t know I –  
 
Audience Member: I don’t want to discuss it because I don’t want to put you back in it 
again. 
 
Igor: 
I wouldn’t say that because now you’re suggesting something bad 
happened, right?  To say look –  
 
Anthony: 
All I’m saying –  
 
Igor: 
Oh, you don’t want to discuss this, be very indirect about it.  It 
seems like something happened then and your mind dealt with it 
appropriately.  If you want to see a hypnotherapist and really 
cleared up, that’s fine, you can work on your own or I can give you 
some recommendations.  Very nonchalant like it’s no big deal 
because really, it is no big deal.  That’s what we do for a living as a 
hypnotherapists, isn’t’ it, right?  Oh my God, I’m having an 
abreaction, what do you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm. Don’t touch, scene fades, feel the chair, you’re safe.  
Bring them back.   
 
Igor: 
Oh, but it was boycotted by one person, so unless everyone’s doing 
this, I’m afraid we’re all staying in this room, yes.  I have hypnotic 
vision right here, so oh my God I’ve having an abreaction!  
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.  
 
Igor: 
That’s better.  I’m staying calm because maybe he knows what he’s 
doing, what do you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Don’t touch!

Igor: 
What happens next?  
 
Audience Member:  Scene fades.  
 
Igor: 
That’s right; the scene is fading but it’s not quite gone yet, what 
happens?  
 
Audience Member:  Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
All right, now I’m believing you a little bit, okay what do you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Feel your chair, know you’re safe.   
 
Igor: 
I need a little bit more, though.  
 
Audience Member:  Feel the chair, know you’re safe.    
 
Igor: 
Oh that was so close, I feel so much better now.  What happens 
next?  
 
Audience Member:  Bring them back.    
 
Igor: 
Anchors don’t work, do they?   
 
Anthony: 
Anchors?  
 
Igor: 
Anchors can’t possible work, can they?  All right guys a little 
warning, we will be coming back to this at random points 
throughout the next two days, so I need to see that energy.  Right, 
why?  Because you need to have that energy if it ever happens, 
right?  That’s the only way you’ll get someone through it, being all 
calm and it’s okay, don’t worry, right?  That just adds fuel to the 
flame, you may as well get lighter fluid, go to the bonfire, go look 
what I can do, right?  Be in control, help them through the 
experience, clear it up or don’t clear it up in terms of therapy.  Just 
put in somewhere safe, the unconscious mind is an expert at 
putting things away so people don’t remember them.

It’s an expert in it because that’s how you stay sane and then bring 
them back out.  Simple, isn’t it?  Make sense?  Okay, so thanks for 
letting me do this because that’s really an important part of the 
whole process.  I hopefully you should feel a little bit more 
confident now as hypnotists going out there.  Should something 
ever go wrong, in terms of an abreaction or something like that, 
you’ll know exactly how to deal with it.  Will that be fair to say?  
 
Audience Member:  Yep.  
 
Igor: 
I don’t believe you now.  All right, that’s like saying like doubt.  So 
I’m having abreaction, what do you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.   
 
Igor: 
What don’t you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Don’t touch.  
 
Igor: 
Okay, I have all this all stuff going on.   
 
Audience Member:  Scene fades.   
 
Igor: 
Okay the scene is fading a little bit, but still there?  
 
Audience Member:  Scene fades.  
 
Igor: 
Okay, now what do you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Feel the chair, you’re safe.   
 
Igor: 
What happens now?  
 
Audience Member:  Bring you back.  
 
Igor: 
Okay, so you think you know what to do when an abreaction occurs 
like random on the streets?  
 
Audience Member:  Absolutely, yes.

Igor: 
All right, half of the groups got it, the other half is not quite sure.  
So I’m having abreaction, what do you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm! 
 
Igor: 
What don’t you do?  
 
Audience Member:  Don’t touch! 
 
Igor: 
What do you say?  
 
Audience Member:  Scene fades.  
 
Igor: 
And it’s fading a little bit, it’s almost gone.  
 
Audience Member:  Scene fades.  
 
Igor: 
Okay.  But I don’t know what just happened, I feel a little bit –  
 
Audience Member:  Feel the chair you’re safe.    
 
Igor: 
Oh, I feel a little bit better but not quite yet.  
 
Audience Member:  Feel chair, know you’re safe.  
 
Igor: 
God, you’re good.  What happens now?  
 
Audience Member:  Bring you back.  
 
Igor: 
Okay.  Do you feel you really know what to do someone should 
someone abreact in your presence?  
 
Audience Member:  Yes.  
 
Igor: 
Okay now I believe you.  Do you think this might be important?   
 
Audience Member:  Yes.  
 
Igor: 
Okay, now you have convinced me.  Oh my God, am having a 
abreaction?

Audience Member:  Stay calm.  Don’t touch, scene fades, feel the chair, know you’re 
safe, bring them up.  
 
Igor: 
Do you think this might be important?  
 
Audience Member:  Yes.  
 
Igor: 
I now believe you, because it is.  
 
Audience Member:  That’s a drill sergeant.  
 
Igor: 
Because it is important, all right.  
 
Anthony:  
And understand, what you’ve got there right, is – this is one of the 
big criticism’s from hypnotherapists about what we’re doing.  What 
if they have an abreaction, what if they have an abreaction, what if 
they run in the road and get run over, while they’re having an 
abreaction?  That, as a structure, and I know that we’ve been 
drilling in but as a structure is entirely appropriate for any situation, 
therapy otherwise and trust me, therapists do not have a whole 
basket full of techniques for dealing with that abreactions.   
 
Most of them going into the same panic as any kind of performer 
does, unless they have a structure and again it doesn’t have to be 
exactly that, but I would do exactly that if I were you. I mean I’m – I 
might like you to go through it again, but trust that you are 
qualified to deal with an abreaction.   
 
Igor: 
Do you feel qualified to deal with an abreaction?  
 
Audience Member:  Yes!  
 
Igor: 
I think I believe them.  All right, are you ready to move on?  
 
Audience Member:  Yes!  
 
Igor: 
All right, I’m not sure, there are a few people – kindly stand up on 
your feet.  All right guys, just to warm you up a little bit again, what 
you’re going to do is find a person, you have literally ten seconds 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
213 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
and put them in trance and get some phenomenon, hypnotic 
phenomenon, whether it’s emotional or physical I don’t care, I just 
want to give you ten – twenty seconds to do it, off you go – both 
ways.  All right guys, this is just a quick warm up exercise to get you 
into – just keep these things zinging, keep them fast. Remember, 
the rule we spoke about in the beginning of yesterday, the very first 
day is still true here.    
 
Say as little and do as little you need to, to get the job done.  But do 
everything you do to get the job done.  Don’t add extra stuff if you 
don’t need to, okay?   
 
The Set Piece 
 
Igor: 
So now is time we actually start unleashing your inner Street 
Hypnotist and I’m giving you the whole shebang in terms of how to 
do this, how to build things up, how to go for the crazy effects like 
stuff you saw Anthony do earlier on and so on.  Anthony has such a 
great process; I can’t put it better myself, so just run them through 
the process you have. 
 
Anthony: 
Again, it’s just another process, it’s another structure.  It’s not set in 
stone. I don’t always follow this rigidly, but from my experience this 
structure is the most effective that I have so this is how I normally 
run things,  every demo I’ve done so far, I’ve used this structure, 
okay?  Still in the realm of the techniques you’ve been using and 
now we’ve got them hypnotized and we’re about to go for our first 
routine.  The way I structure my routines is to go for physical 
routines, I know I’ve said this, but I’m going to go over again.  
Physical routines, hand levitation, hand stuck, eye’s stuck, feet 
stuck to the floor, can’t stop your arms from moving, can’t open 
your mouth, tons of things you can do – physical routines. An arm 
bar, a hand lock, anything you want to do, but doing it as a routine 
now.   
 
Then I move into emotional routines, that just means changing the 
way that person is feeling, you’ve see me do it a couple of times 
with laughter, that tends to be where I normally go because it 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
214 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
makes people laugh.  I mean you heard him laughing; it’s very 
difficult to mimic laughing with complete abandon you know. 
 
And once people hear that, it becomes very, very infectious and the 
more the audience laughs, the more you hear laughter, the more 
funny you’re going to find it and again you’ll hear me hammering 
home that suggestion lots of different ways.  But I’m always going 
to hook in, do my best to hook in one routine to the next.  So if I’m 
doing arm levitation, then it’s going to make you feel good, it’s 
going to give you a sense of well being.  In fact this is going to start 
seem funny and in the demo I did with Michael, sure I did a bit of 
uninvited therapy and I was –  
 
Igor: 
Can I just pause you there for a moment?  
 
Anthony: 
Yeah.  
 
Igor: 
Now I just want to pause on what he’s was doing there.  He’s going 
from his arm lifting, to making you feel good, that’s a low level 
intervention.  You’re going to find it amusing, it’s a little bit more 
intensity in the intervention, in fact you’re going to find it funny, in 
fact you’re going to have to laugh.  You see how he’s escalating it 
slowly, he’s not saying, it’s so funny you have to laugh, I’m sure you 
can do it.  But it’s slowly building up towards the full intensity of the 
experience rather trying to dump them into the deep end straight 
away, make sense?  
 
Anthony:  
Yeah and it can be – it can be this that’s funny.  It can be that and 
you just find this funny.  But in the example I gave there, just to 
clarify and you have to make this statement very quickly.  I said, so I 
came across this idea there’s something you’ve loved to feel 
differently about, something that if you could smile or laugh you’d 
be so much better off.  And he immediately smiled, and I knew I 
had him.  Some of the first few times I did that, it’s the second or 
third time I did that, is on my therapy course, because there’s this 
guy with his arm lifting and I said, there’s something you’d loved to 
feel differently about.  Something that you’ve really love to feel 
differently about.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

As that arm lifts, it’s going to start to seem funny.  And he laughed 
and bellowed and it all came out, he opened his eyes afterwards 
and said, “I was in the Falkland’s War standing on the deck of a ship 
and I was machine gunned, my ankle, all the way across my body up 
into my neck, my shoulder.”  That was not F’ing funny.  Came in the 
next morning said, that’s the first full night’s sleep I’ve had since 
1984, or whenever it was.  So the point is that it still works and I 
sometimes use that at the end of therapy, when someone says they 
haven’t  been hypnotized and I know they have.   
 
I would just say, let me show me something, do that, I’ll crack them 
up laughing and everyone leaves.  And I’ve had people say, when I 
tie it into a moment that, that was worth the cost to the session.  
Okay, so anyway we’re back in the realms of physical, I’m now 
going to something emotional.  When I get the laughter going – if 
you need to back off, if someone is just like “Yeah”  (small chuckle) 
that’s one thing, when it comes off the hook in unbridled laughter 
like we had with Michael, then I now know I can ride on the back of 
the emotional phenomenon that are occurring and I can get into 
the next level, which for me is mental or cognitive phenomenon.   
 
Things like amnesia, not being able to do simple mental tasks, or 
being unable to stop yourself in doing them.  Having massive belief 
changes going on up here in terms of what you know and don’t 
know, who you are, what you’re name is, complete personality, 
identity shifts, all that kind of stuff is going to occur up here.  So 
physical, emotional and mental, okay, is how I’m going to generally 
rack through the suggestions.  One other point on this is that I’m a 
big believer in strong moments, okay, and spotting, just from 
experience, that these moments coming.  So let’s say it’s the same 
routine, its hand levitation into laughter and in a moment I’m going 
to touch the back of your hand and it’s going to start to lift up off 
your leg.   
 
It’s going to get lighter and lighter and lighter.  That’s right, it’s 
starting to go, it’s starting to go.  There’s one moment when it 
starts, there’s another moment when it lifts off the leg.  In a 
moment you can feel it lift off your leg, when it lifts up off your leg 
you’re going to feel, blah, blah, blah.  It’s going to get higher and 
higher and higher.  I know there’s another moment, because I’ve 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
216 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
got his head as a target now, but just up in the air, I kind of lose that 
strong moment, I’ve done that a couple of times.  With this one I 
know I can build that momentum because I’ve got his head as the 
next target, it’s gotten closer and closer, that feeling is going to 
grow, the closer it gets, the strongly it’s going to get and when it 
touches your head and it’s a bit like, and when your fingers touch, 
it’s the same thing.   
 
When it touches your head this is going to happen, bang!  Okay, so 
whatever you’re doing, try to think where’s the beginning of this?  
Where’s the – is there any strong moment in between? Is there a 
strong moment at the end? Once I’ve got it up here, I’ve got it un-
sticking, that’s a moment, I’ve got it touching down, there’s a 
moment and I’m generally going to kinda’ bind the person in to the 
next suggestion, is that pretty much clear?  Especially if you’re out 
in the street, trust me, or you’re in a club doing this.  You turn your 
head that much, there’s a good chance they won’t hear you.   
 
And people do it, they start looking around and they’re giving a 
suggestion and its being missed or misheard.  So yes, I’ll click my 
finger, yes that is another feed, a bit like rocking the shoulder, every 
time I click my finger it will get funnier.  But sometimes I look at 
videos myself, and I think, stop clicking your fingers you buffoon.   
It’s like; it’s just become a bad habit, so how does it register?  Well, 
sometimes it’ll just register in the same way the words “sleep, or 
deeper and deeper” does.  They just seem to know that that’s the 
cue, it’s so build into it; hypnotists click their fingers, okay?  The 
other way it registers is that I’ll put it into his attention and I’ll link 
what I want to the click.  
 
Audience Member:  It doesn’t have to mean one thing and one thing only, it means 
whatever you want it to?  
 
Anthony:  
No, it just means whatever I mean at that moment.   
 
Igor:  
Try it out, actually get your partner to do it with you, so you have to 
be the subject and if they click their fingers for all these different 
things, you’ll have a personal experience of the kinds of ways that 
people interpret these things.  That will be just one way of course, 
there’ll be other ways.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Anthony:  
Yeah, sometimes I mean if you watch the hypno sculpture guy, 
you’ll see him do this one side to the other, again, it’s 
disorientating.  When I do the thing with the postural sway, I’ll very 
often kind of half circle round the person and I’ll be clicking on 
different sides and touch them at different points and it’s all kind of 
physically overloading them, mentally overloading them just 
disorientating them, even if the conscious minds hanging unto that, 
is he here, is he there?  Hey, what’s he doing?  Where is he?  That, 
with your eyes shut and your head back is all going to add the 
effect.  So some people can’t click their fingers, clack, it doesn’t 
have to be a click but I find again, it helps define specifically what 
that moment is.  
 
When I gave a critique of a couple of guys doing in the induction 
yesterday what was missing was that moment.  The exact bang!  
Your fingers touch, close your eyes, sleep.  There was a pause or a 
kind of – in those pauses sometimes the person will re-orientate, 
because their head goes down, they look up again, they think hang 
on and now you’re having to – it’s about the strength at that point.  
And that’s not really what you need.  So, we’ve gone through the 
physical, we’ve gone through the emotional, the next step for me – 
you’ve got question? 
 
Audience Member:  No.    
 
Anthony: 
No?  The next stage for me I say is mental phenomena, cognitive 
phenomena that just means stuff that really is based on their 
mental abilities and skills.  Now, my preference – I just try to avoid 
some of the more cliché routines, for no other the reason than they 
are a bit cliché, right?  But cliché routines still go down a storm with 
people.  My next stop is normally amnesia.  And I know because I 
spent a long time not doing amnesia because it is a real binary 
mental test.  As in it’s going to pass or fail, you don’t half 
remember, you can remember it or you cannot remember it.  
Okay?   
 
So that’s my normal stop and we’ll talk about phasing routines in a 
moment, but just say it’s with regards to amnesia, kind of classic or 
cliché routine is to make a person forget a number, okay?  So let’s 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
218 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
just say I was getting into that, let’s say I had his hand up here, he’s 
laughing.  One strong moment I could bounce off, from this 
situation, is in a moment I’ll click my fingers, your hand will drop 
down, your eyes will open now, everything will be back to normal 
but you will no longer be able to remember your name, okay?  So 
I’m still going to have this moment of  and one, two, wide awake.  
You alright?  
 
So when I do that and I bring them round, I normally ask one 
question and it’s not linguistically clever, I just say, are you warm 
enough, or how’re you feeling, or nice shoes you’re wearing.  Just – 
it’s the same when I end a therapy session, you just got to redirect 
the person’s attention and it tends to help with amnesia naturally.  
So that’s why you get this genuine response of, as they try and 
access it and they find they can’t – in fact it’s just shut up, I know 
my name, I know my name.  Is it a long name or a short name?  
What’s it like not to know your name?  If I feel it’s weakening, then 
I’m going to start hitting him with those questions, what’s it like not 
to know your name?   
 
It’s weird isn’t it, try and find it, it goes even further; I’ll repeat the 
suggestion just to make sure that sticks.  The other little tip and 
again, if you’re happy for me to do this, just explain about amnesia 
and like everything else I’ve done, where I’m finding ten ways to 
give the same suggestion, I don’t take any chances with that first 
bite of amnesia, if you like.  Now I’ve had two cases where I’ve said 
it’s all going fine, doing all the stuff and they’re laughing, I said in a 
moment, you’re eyes open and you’ll no longer be able to 
remember number three.   
 
It’ll be gone from your mind and as I’m giving that suggestion it 
spooks the person to such a degree that they’ve literally come out 
of it.  And on both occasions, one was a teacher and one was an 
accountant and it’s just been this overwhelming feeling and it’s 
coming out of nowhere, no I really need the number three, stop this 
now.  So to make sure this sticks is very simple phrase, I just say just 
for a time, you will no longer better remember your name it will be 
gone, rubbed out, just for a time.  Rubbed off, if you’re over thirty, 
I’ll say blackboard if you’re under thirty, I tend to say white board 
these days.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
219 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
But you know, it’s just rubbed out.  Sometimes I’ll say, “Reach up 
and rub it off the blackboard,” and you’ll get this kind of reaction.  
It’s gone, just for a time, which gives them the comfort of “Oh I’m 
going to get it back.”  Just in case they’re having that subconscious 
panic.  So just for a time it will be gone, rubbed out.  This is very 
much an Ormond McGill kind of technique.  I don’t want him just to 
forget his name; I want him to not be able to say it.  I did this to the 
girl on the street yesterday.  Her name is Jessica, I said, “You no 
longer remember your name, just for a time it will be gone.  You 
will no longer be able to say, speak, think your name. The harder 
you try to speak it the more distant it’ll become.”  And hammered it 
all in. 
 
You know, the usual blank expression, she’s trying to find her name 
and then she was like “zzzz” right now, as far as I was concerned, 
she’d remembered her name.  But she can’t say it, so it’s like “zzzz” 
try and say it, try and say it, “zzzz”, sleep.  And again, I work with 
Kev and all our routines, the way we normally run amnesia is to do 
name amnesia.  Later on we’ll talk about how to get three or four 
phases out with name amnesia, rubbing it out, you can’t remember 
your name, eyes open, what’s your name?  I don’t know, sleep.  You 
can squeeze a lot more juice out of that.   
 
And then I tend to go for total amnesia; you’re going to start to 
hear about some of our routines now.  Some of them, some of 
you’ll not want to do these routines, for some of you it just won’t 
be appropriate for the kind of work that you’re going to want to do, 
but in the safety of entertainment show, I like to push my subject.  
So my next phase after name amnesia is total amnesia, all right?  So 
I just say sleep, next time your eyes open, I want you wide awake.  
You will not be able to remember anything.  You’ll have complete 
amnesia, anything I ask you – you won’t have a clue, you might 
guess, but you have complete amnesia.   
 
Eyes open, wide awake. And you’ll notice, I often say nod your head 
when that’s onboard, or nod your head when that’s understood.  I 
said to him, “your head will nod automatically” and I got this kind of 
thing going.  “Total amnesia, eyes open, what’s your name?”  Just 
make sure it stuck.  So those feet you’ve got, every single person 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
220 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
I’ve asked that does this, looks at their shoe.  Trivial question, trivial 
question and then I’ll say something like, “do you drive?”  In one 
show this one woman had a thirteen year old and an eight year old 
in the front row and I said, “Got any children?”  No.  So the next 
question is, crazy uncle stare, “Where are you?  Who are all these 
people?”   
 
Now to win funding for this TV project we work in Holland, it’s quite 
a tough one.  You can’t work easily with people with second 
language.  But I did that to this girl who ended up in the frame for 
it.  And it all began swimmingly beyond the say, silly stuff.  “Where 
are you?  Who are these people?” (she starts crying hysterically) 
 
Audience Member:  Stay calm.  
 
Anthony:  
Sleep, it’s all back now, I thought I’ve blown it.  Kev was standing 
next to the producers, (and they were rubbing their hands 
together) and it got funding and part of it was Dutch TV.  I want see 
a few tears.  So, but what I’m saying is, because my manner 
changed, my emotional kind of suggestion changed, it had a 
massive effect.  I’m not going to let that run, I’m not going to punish 
the person.  But what I’m saying is that, that’s where amnesia can 
go.   So when we talk about phasing, we’ll show you how to do that 
with a number and a name and different things, but for me that’s 
typically how I’ll get into it.  Counting is another one, you can’t 
count.   There’s so many gags you can do on the back of that, I just 
did a couple of things.   
 
You’re going to count to a billion.  You count to infinity; it’s a bit of a 
Peter Powers thing actually.  Stand someone very early on and just 
that’s it, that’s it for them.   That’s the whole show, they’re just 
going to try to count to infinity, every now and again you’ll walk 
past, stick the mic in their face and set them off again.  We had an 
amusing one with that with a guy on a course.  I said you’re going to 
count to a million.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, I was 
going faster, faster, faster. In the end of this class I thought he was 
going to take off.  He’s literally like “zzzz” I’m in, he got there.  But 
hopefully he can see I’m ratcheting it up, I’m using the back end of 
one suggestion, hooking it into the end of the next one, when this 
comes off, you’ll feel this.

And now stop laughing, that’s a dramatic moment when you 
bellowing with laughter. I normally say things like, “you’ll keep all 
the good feelings, feel all those good chemicals flooding through 
your brain and your body.”  We’ll talk about the drug of choice and 
stuff at some point.  I like to give people these good experiences 
and keep all the good stuff.  And now, “stop laughing” and that’s as 
dramatic, that’s when all their friends are pointing and laughing 
and, “OHH!”  In the same way a reinduction is often the most 
entertaining bit for people that are watching.  You get the gasp on 
the ‘sleep’, because that’s the power of the hypnotist, boom!  
Sleep! “OHH!”  He’s gone again, so it’s same, if I’ve got a big 
emotional reaction, I just stop it.   
 
Igor:  
Let’s just pause here for a moment.  
 
Anthony:  
Yeah.  
 
Igor:  
All you guys have been doing pretty much all of this except for 
maybe the last stage, haven’t you?  You’ve all put someone in 
trance, would that be fair to say? You fractionated to get a few 
cycles out of it?  You got a physical response to some sort, yes?  
Relatively easily?  You hooked onto that some kind of emotional 
response, right?  Would that be fair to say?  So now all you’re doing 
is your attaching one more thing into that whole training.  It’s really 
just one extra step on the things that you’re already doing.  You see 
what I mean by that?  All the other stuff we’re talking about, like 
the timing, the moments and the ways of milking it, these are ways 
of elaborating and making more of it and that will come, just feed 
that in to the extent you can.   
 
But just keep that basic structure in your mind, you trance, you 
fractionate and you have something physical, something emotional, 
something mental.  That pretty much opens the doorway to all 
kinds of interesting things.   
 
Anthony:  
I mean, as a performer, once I get amnesia, I am feeling a hundred 
times more comfortable and have the belief that I’m going to get 
those perceptual changes.  I’m going to get those hallucination; 
negative hallucinations.  So it’s a big, it seems like a big step.  The 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
222 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
truth is; it is just another suggestion.  But hammer it home, sell it; 
take any fear out of it.  Quite a few times there will Michael, I told 
them how he’d feel about things.  I didn’t dictate exactly what – I 
said, you’re gonna feel like this.  Well, this is going to freak you out, 
or this is going to be seem funny to you.  There’s another little soft 
test that when he’s trying to remember his name and chuckles that 
it’s landed, okay. 
 
Igor:  
So is that a relatively easy thing for you guys to practice now?  
Would that be fair to say?  It was like me, do that? I don’t know.  
Would you like to have one little step you can add in that will make 
it easier for you?  We’ll give you more of a safety blanket, would 
that be of interest to you guys?  Just makes that whole process a 
little bit easier with all that extra stuff you have to put in.  I mean 
otherwise we would just off and –  
 
Anthony: 
I’d like to hear it.  
 
Igor: 
Anthony, let’s turn the microphones off and we’ll have a chat. It’s a 
joke; leave the microphones where they are.  I’m trying to tease the 
audience, okay.  Damn it, they just ruined my moment!   
 
So, you would like to have a simple little thing you can add into the 
whole thing that makes the whole thing a little bit more robust.  It’s 
another suggestion, basically.  I believe someone’s coined it as a 
Super Suggestion, that’s Jonathan Chase. 
 
Anthony: 
John Chase called it a Super Suggestion in reference to a book from 
the 1870’s.   
 
Igor: 
But it’s been around for a long, long time.  Essentially the 
suggestion goes something along the lines of - from this point 
forward, everything I say to you is your reality, no matter how silly 
it might be, no matter how strange it may sound, whatever I say 
you experience, you feel, you do, etcetera. Words to that effect.  
There’s various permutations of how you must mask the secret 
formula, but honestly you know me, I’m not particularly impressed 
by the formula, I’m impressed by the idea, the concept, the concept 
you’re getting across.

Anthony: 
The concept is the suggestion that they will accept all your 
suggestions.   
 
Igor: 
Right.  
 
Anthony: 
A nice suggestion to have land, again you can soften it.  I normally 
do by saying, because you have a super powerful creative mind, 
that’s essentially I’m justifying why they’ll be able to do it.   
 
Igor: 
If you want to put another layer on it say, just for the time being, or 
just for this process or demonstration, or whatever.  So again, it lets 
people know that they’re not going to be under your power 
forever.  But it’s a very nice little thing because really, if people 
accept that, even if they accept that at an intellectual level, they’re 
basically saying, I’m game to go wherever this takes me.  If 
someone starts having issues with that, there and then, that’s 
something you need to already, you need to bring them back out of 
trance and find out what that is, because that’s going to be possibly  
a block later on, down the process.   
 
Anthony:  
And it’s a bit of a timing thing when you deliver this suggestion.  
Again you – because it’s in my book, a lot of people think you have 
to use the Super Suggestion, no you don’t.  I’ve been doing this for 
15 years before I started using it.  It’s a bit of a timing thing, same 
kind of panic can occur, as I mentioned, with amnesia.  If it’s all 
going swimmingly and they’re laughing and arm levitation’s 
happening, and suddenly I say, everything now is your reality, 
everything I say to you becomes real to you, it will pop people out 
just like that.   
 
No way, so just deliver it at the right time, soften it by giving it back 
to them.  And then my preference is to immediately ratify it with a 
suggestion.  And generally I’ll step right back to a physical 
suggestion like an arm bar.  So I’ve delivered the Super Suggestion, 
the proof of it is that now, bang, you can’t bend your arm.  That’s 
right, everything I say to you is your reality no matter how stupid or 
silly it seems.  It’s just for a time. You’re safe, you’re fine, you’re 
protected, sleep.  And now, I know we’re good to go.  You can tone 
it down if you’re going to use it for therapeutic purposes, but for 
Street Hypnosis, I tend to keep it.

However silly and stupid it seems - if I’m feeling really good I’ll say 
however wild and crazy it seems, depends whether I’m planning to 
tape the routines.  If I specifically want the person to have visual 
hallucinations I’ll say “You’ll see what I say you can see” if I wanted 
to have some severe mental phenomena occurring, you know what 
I say you know.   You’ll say what I say you can say, you’ll be able to 
taste what I say you can taste.  So I’m just going to tweak it a little 
bit, depending on where I’m planning to go.  I know, everything I 
say will be becoming reality, should cover all bases, but let’s just 
make it clear.  You will see what I say you can see.  
 
Igor: 
So does that all make sense to you guys?  It’s really just adding a 
step in the middle and a step at the end.  And the rest is all the stuff 
we’ve been doing anyways, right?  So who feels like giving that a 
go?   
 
All right guys, are you having fun?   
 
Audience Member:  Yes!  
 
Igor: 
Did you enjoy doing that?   
 
Audience Member:  Yes! 
 
Igor: 
Did you go through the three basic routines, the mental, the 
physical and the emotional?   
 
Audience Member:  Yes.   
 
Anthony: 
Right.   
 
Igor: 
One person – say it again.   You all went through with them?  Did 
you do at least two of them?  Yes?   
 
Audience Member:  Yes.  
 
Anthony: 
Let’s say I was doing something, like my kind of opener on stage, so 
I’ve got the people up and I’ve hypnotized them.  I used to drop 
them on the floor, don’t anymore.  But let’s say I’ve got a load of 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
225 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
bodies on the floor and they’ve got to earn the right to sit in one of 
my chairs, as far as I’m concern.  So when they’re on the floor I say, 
“It’s a perfect day, even in the parks. Perfect day for you”, it’s not 
quite a hot and cold routine, but basically, you’re in the park, and it 
starts to heat up and you’re going to feel these little bugs around, 
things flying around and it starts to itch and scratch.  So I’m just 
looking for people that start to give this (scratching himself, or 
swatting at bugs).  That physical routine essentially, that feeling 
could become frustration.   
 
 
You’re trying to swat them away, you’re getting more and more 
frustrated, more and more annoyed by this.  So that could be a 
feeling, even though it’s a negative feeling essentially, frustration, 
confusion, all these kind of things.  But generally for me, laughter is 
the best place, it completely, genuinely changes their state, their 
brain’s getting flooded with good chemicals.  I know they’re feeling 
good and the audience genuinely buy it.  So just think of an 
emotion, and see, is it appropriate and find a way of tying that into 
a routine. 
 
Amnesia 
 
 Anthony:  
Now, just to say with amnesia, I’m assuming some of you managed 
to get your subject to achieve amnesia.  But for some of you, it 
probably failed to that point.  All right, how many had success with 
amnesia?  That’s – it’s a lot different to a physical and emotional 
stuff, right?  It’s not tougher to suggest, it is just another 
suggestion.  But it takes a bit more hypnotic skill.  And no one’s 
quite put their finger on that.  And we’ve got various ways of trying 
to improve it.  But it’s a bigger deal, it’s a bigger, it’s just the way it 
is.  It’s a numbers game, you’re going to get less people 
experiencing amnesia than your arm levitation.   
 
So you have to accept that, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re doing 
anything wrong.  I saw some of you when you had a failure, just 
trying to deal with it, just fractionating them, putting them back in, 
that’s number one, stop, important call. But if you didn’t actually 
get it, because your subject in this moment, with this hypnotist is 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
226 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
incapable of that, don’t be disheartened.  Just get used to getting 
the words out and giving the suggestions.  
 
Igor: 
And then just go out on the streets, go to another routine, like a 
physical one. That’s what people will remember, they’ll remember 
the first thing you did, they’ll remember the last thing you did.  And 
they’ll forget about the fact that they didn’t forget.  It’s kind of 
weird.   
 
Anthony: 
And you don’t really – even if someone did say – I remember my 
name.  I just – you say that’s fine, it’s just the way it is sometimes 
and just brush it off.  Just laugh it off and move forward again, pick 
the next person.  But as I say, if you did get it and some of you have 
obviously experienced this from the inside, and I’m guessing from 
most of you, the feeling is I know it, I know my bloody name, I can 
see it in my head, it’s on the tip of my tongue.   Just remember that 
is amnesia, that’s not faking amnesia, it’s not knowing amnesia, it’s 
not being able to access or give the information.  So just tie it in 
with can’t say it, speak it, think it.   
 
Igor: 
Did you all remember to clear the amnesia even if it didn’t quote 
unquote quite work afterwards?  Yes?  It’s very important.  Even if it 
doesn’t seem to have worked, make sure you clear it because 
strange thing can happen even if it doesn’t take it right there.  It can 
have like a rolling effect, I remember one person, wasn’t actually 
me as the hypnotist at a party, suggested to someone that at the 
click of their fingers, I think got a bunch of flowers, or they wanted 
to eat a bunch of flowers, which was on the table or something 
weird like that.  Of course the person must have just failed, they 
went click, and nothing.   
 
 
For the next month that person was dreaming about flowers and 
they couldn’t explain why.  And she’s like “Flowers everywhere, I 
don’t get it, it’s driving me nuts.”  So even if it doesn’t seem to have 
worked there can be an underlying thing that just kind of, like a 
little burning coal, that just glows and can build over time.  So take 
no chances, unless it’s a really positive life affirming situation.  
Leave those, that’s a good thing to leave burning in the 
underground of the unconscious.   But just clear it, just out of 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

principle; it’s a good thing to do.  It’s just nice habit to get into, and 
if it’s a habit then you’ll always remember to do it.  Make sense?    
 
 
Street Instructions 
 
Igor: 
We’re going to go out right now, we’re going to meet downstairs in 
the lobby.  Please get back into groups, A, B and C. Couple of key 
concepts to keep in mind folks.  Number one, keep it simple.  This is 
easy stuff have fun with it.  Number two, we’re not going to force 
you to do anything, if you just want to observe, really its fine, right?  
If you have the courage and go, you know what, I’m going to go for 
it now, that’s fine too.  If a crowd starts building, if you feel like 
taking someone out of the crowd and say, let me show you what 
he’s doing, that’s fine, all right?   
 
 
We’re not pushing you at this point, now it’s up to you guys start 
taking the momentum for yourselves a bit more and we’ll be more 
kind of observers.  We’ll jump in if we need to jump in.  If you want 
to have a hand with something, you can wave us over, you have 
that comfort.  But it’s really about you guys doing your own thing, 
finding your own rhythm, finding your own pace.  And you’re better 
off just observing and not doing something if you feel really locked 
up and really don’t want to do it, than creating some kind of a weird 
anxiety complex if you don’t want to do it.  At the same time, if you 
have a little bit of anxiety, it’s still worthwhile pushing yourself 
through that because when you get that pay off, it is glorious.  Isn’t 
that true guys?   
 
Audience Member:  Yes. 
 
Igor:  
Everyone who’s had that happened?   
 
Audience Member:  Yes.  
 
Igor:  
Some of you guys were literally pale with blood draining from your 
faces like, (croaking sound) but then when the pay off came, it was 
like “wow” is it that easy?

And I’d like for you guys to experience that, if not here, there will be 
another time, there might be a dinner party, you might be out with 
some friends and there’s a few beers flowing and you thought, I 
could give this ago, right?  Who knows, the point is go as far as is 
right for you right now, have fun with this and just really enjoy.  
Push the envelope as far as it will push and if you’re okay with 
things just falling apart at the edges, then push it as far as that.  And 
if you’d rather not, then just take it to the point you feel 
comfortable.  This is time for you to start taking control of what 
you’re doing.  Make sense?   
 
Anthony:  
Just two little points.  I know some of you came in here with some 
skills, with some inductions, with some rapid inductions, I’ve seen a 
couple of people doing the butterfly and  things, right?  We’re less 
rigid, keep the general structure, but I’m not rigid about what 
techniques you use.  If you have a set piece you prefer, do it.  If you 
have an induction you like, do it.   
 
Igor:  
All right guys, with that happy thought and everyone seems so calm 
downed again, so quick five second induction and back and we’ll go.

Who noticed a little bit of a crowd gathering when you’re doing 
hypnosis in the streets?  Just a small one of like fifty people or so?  
Anthony and I were thinking, “Wow, we’ve left at the right point. 
Either they’re going to have an amazing time or the police will come 
and arrest everyone on principle.”   
 
Audience Member: The police did come.   
 
Igor: 
That’s why I left. 
 
Anthony: 
I said as I left that there’s going to be some heat here in a moment.   
 
Igor: 
The police always get interested when there are large crowds 
gathering.  Could it be a political thing?  You know the whole story.   
 
Anthony: 
What was their question?  What did you say? 
 
Audience Member: He came walking up and he said, “What are you guys doing here?”  I 
said, “Actually we’re a convention, one of the largest conventions 
of Street Hypnotists.”  Oh for one.   
 
Anthony: 
I’m all up for it. 
 
Audience Member: It ends well, so sorry about that.  I said, “What we are out here 
doing is just demonstrations into research into the power of self 
hypnosis.”   
 
Anthony: 
Beautiful. 
 
Igor: 
That was nice. 
 
Audience Member: Good recovery.  He said, “Well, what is this all about?”  I said, 
“We’re not charging any fees or doing anything.  We’re just 
showing people the power of their unconscious mind.  It’s really 
very, very cool.  I don’t remember who it was and somebody came 
up and said, “Would you like to be hypnotized?”  The guy says, 
“No.”  I said, “Well, think about it.  You’ve absolutely the perfect 
excuse if you were.  You could say, ‘I went up there to see what 
they were doing, but there was like eighty of them.  They were like 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

hooligan hypnotists, they overpowered me, I couldn’t do 
anything.’”  He laughed at that. 
 
Igor: 
That is good. 
 
Audience Member: I said, “It’s all good.”  Then it was about 1:35pm at that point, I said, 
“We have to get back to class.  We’re here for a seminar and this is 
what we do for lunch.  How weird is that?”  He said, “That is really 
weird.” But he was laughing and smiling and he was totally cool.  
 
Anthony: 
Good for you.  Well handled.  Our few outings on the street – Kev 
and I and a couple other friends formed a little club called Hypno - 
Attack.  It is not as violent as it sounds.  That was our collective.  We 
used to pick a neutral town.  Get a cheap B&B and just hit the town 
all afternoon and all night and grow as hypnotists.  A few times I’ve 
been right into it and looked up and I’ve seen that policeman.  
Generally, I’ve shut it down.  “It’s just mind tricks.  I’m just having 
some fun.”  Every time, they’ve simply been watching.  They’re like 
bored community service officers, they aren’t really policemen.   
 
They’re just strolling around.  It’s just like, “Oh there is something 
happening there.”  The one time they did get a bit more involved, it 
was because they were concerned for our well being because we 
had taken on like four gang leaders from I don’t even remember 
where it was, while we were walking around.  You just have to be 
aware and as I said in the UK – I’m not going to go into the details, 
but the line that you just said, “I’m just doing some research about 
the power of people’s minds.”  It doesn’t have to be scientific.  It’s -  
just frame it in that fashion.  It is like, “What’s the problem?”  And 
there isn’t a problem.   
 
Igor: 
Police officers, they’re human beings as well.  Their job is to 
basically make sure that the public is in order.  If you give them 
cause to believe that the public won’t be in order like, “What’s 
wrong?  It’s nothing to do with you.  Just leave us and our civil 
rights.”  Well, then at that point they will be like, “There is a wacko 
here.  Let’s get some boys back here and make sure it is all good.”  
Whereas if you’re cool and calm and you’re like, “No, we are just 
showing some people some cools things about themselves, which is 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
231 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
exactly what you did.”  It just basically says to them, you’re not 
needed here; this is not a time for me to intervene.   
 
 
Approach Styles 
 
Igor: 
At that point, they’ll just stick around like a human being does 
because let’s face it – did you notice people being a little bit curious 
about what you’re doing?  Remember we talked about this idea 
about doing this step wise approach, if you don’t want to approach 
people directly.  It can be emotionally challenging, especially in 
today’s society.  Did you notice how easy it was to bring people in 
once there is a demo going on?  You do a demo.  Other people start 
watching and can’t believe it.  You don’t say, “Do you want to have 
a go?”  Because they will say, “Who the hell are you?”  But instead 
you say, “Isn’t that amazing?  Come closer, just watch.  Let me tell 
you a little bit about what is going on here.   
 
Right now he’s getting them to focus their attention and open their 
imagination and so on.”  And they’ll go, “Really?  Wow.  That’s 
amazing.  Look do you see that?”  “Do you want to have a go?”  
“Sure.  I’ll do that.”  Now they see someone else having a good 
time, but do you see how that’s a very natural way to open them up 
at this point.  That’s why I kept saying to you guys, I don’t care if 
you can’t do the approach phase, which we spent a lot of time 
building up.  It’s an important phase; don’t get me wrong – if you 
want to do this on your own.  If you can’t you past the little hump 
of the approach phase, I’m not fussed.  It’s a no-brainer to me, just 
bring a friend. 
 
Anthony: 
Do it by stealth and just supplement that way.   
 
Igor: 
You don’t even have to bring a hypnotic friend.  Just bring a friend 
who is willing to be hypnotized in public and if you feel a little bit 
antsy about that, just hypnotize them in private first and tell them 
they’ll do great in public.  Then you do it in public.  Here’s the key, 
guys, -- the groups I was with I pointed this out to, so you can see 
this – what happens in a public setting is this.  If I could borrow you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
232 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
for a moment?  Let’s say you’re in trance right now, head bowed 
forward.  Anthony is doing the hypnosis and I’m a member of the 
public, right.  Typically what will happen is that I’m walking along 
and I’m doing this.  I’ll fall over a little bit.  I’ll watch for a little bit 
and I’ll go, “Oh, I’m not allowed to be here.”  I’ll scurry off.  Thank 
you very much.   
 
Give him a nice round of applause.  A nice round of applause here, 
folks.   There you go.  There’s a window, usually between thirty and 
fifty seconds that they’ll hang around.  They’ll watch and think 
that’s cool.  But if they don’t feel like they’re invited, they don’t feel 
like they’re allowed to watch, they’ll move on again.  If this is the 
strategy you want to take, then what you need to do is engage your 
audience.  Typically they’ll be over there, kind of near where the 
back row is in here right now.  If you’re doing your work over here 
and you spot someone being curious, I’d say, “C’mon over here and 
watch.  You can go deeper and deeper.  Watch, this is cool.  No, I’m 
not going to ask you for money.  Just stand here.” 
 
Anthony: 
It is like being a good barman or a good restaurant assistant.  They 
know they can’t get you for the next ten minutes if they don’t look 
at you. Because of that, if they refuse to make eye contact, you 
stand there getting annoyed and waving your note around.  If they 
acknowledge you and wave, you know you’re going to get served.  
You know that you’re in their head.  It’s the same, if you look 
around, smile, call them in or gesture for them to come in, then it 
all gets more inclusive.  Then it becomes a bit more of a stage, a bit 
more a spectacle.  You’ve now got a nice got a nice circle of people 
around you. 
 
Igor: 
You can just bounce straight into the next thing like you’ve just 
done a little thing with your friends.  You go, “Wow, that’s amazing.  
Did you guys like that?  Come in close.  Let me show you something 
else I could do.”  Then you do it with everyone.  Then they start 
feeling good or “Let me show you something else that makes you 
feel even better than this.”  They feel like they’re getting the insider 
secrets or something.  Then you’re into your full set, your full 
routine.  Whether it’s the routine that we taught you in the process, 
that is a great routine.  I have a lot of respect for it.  
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
233 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
I think Anthony has really tested it and streamlined it.  I like that a 
lot.  If you want to make up your own routine, honestly, I don’t 
care.  Your results may vary a little bit at first, but then you’re 
exploring new territory and you’ll develop your skills with that too, 
it doesn’t matter.  The key thing is that you’re now no longer 
performing to one person, which is your subject.  You’re now 
performing to a group.  As soon as you see an attention coming 
your way, you’ve got to acknowledge it.  You’ve got to foster it with 
a little bit of kindness, so that they feel like, “Yeah, I’m allowed to 
do this.”   
 
Anthony: 
Go into Covent Garden Square and look how hard the guys work, 
who work there in the main square, to get a crowd.  They will spend 
twenty or thirty minutes before they do a single stunt or trick.  It’s 
all about – I’m not saying you have to take it that far, but that’s how 
hard you can work if you really want to. 
 
Igor: 
They get literally crowds of hundreds.  The best people – this is 
actually a great place – if you see those public arena’s where there’s 
public performers, you’ll see that there are different kinds of 
performers.  Some have three people there that are working their 
backsides off.  There are others who come in and pull people in.  
They’re friendly and their group dynamic is phenomenal.   
 
They really understand how that works and within minutes they 
have a crowd there laughing, it’s engaging.   You do not need one 
hundred, two hundred, three hundred spectators around you.  It’s 
fun if you do.  You only need five, six, seven people.  That is very 
easy to get.  Hopefully this gives you an alternative to the cold 
approach, the walk up approach.  So that if you’re feeling a little bit 
insecure about it, it’s okay.  You don’t have to change anything 
about that.  Our only goal is that when you get confident this way, 
doing a little cheating with your friends and bring the crowd in, 
you’ll understand how much of a no-brainer it is.  Then you’ll just go 
out and start talking to normal people anyway because you’ll get 
used to working with people.  That social bubble that we’re afraid 
of, dissolves around you more smoothly.  It’s a nice easy road in. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s been good to see a couple of you working with more than one 
person at this kind of stage.  What I haven’t seen, some of you may

have done it, is anyone really playing the numbers and putting in 
the effort at that point.  It is just that you happened to land two 
people. Is Zultan here?  As you can see, Zultan is doing extremely 
well because he is bright and he is smiley and he’s engaging. 
 
Igor: 
Zoran. 
 
Anthony: 
Right. Sorry, Zoran.  Zultan.   
 
Igor: 
He’s thinking Buck Rogers again. 
 
Anthony: 
Right, but we walked outside and there’s a hen party.  All I said was, 
“If we walk past this group without engaging them, you know, I’ll be 
disappointed.”  We did engage them.  We had three of four people.  
I’d say three of them are interested.  There are one or two others 
who were on the sidelines at that point.  By the time you actually 
got to doing the exercise, you had one.  Great, you did a brilliant job 
with that one.  But if you seize that moment and you’ve got your 
people, they’re encouraging each other; that’s the point where you 
need to step up and be bigger than the group.  You say, “Right.  
Let’s have you shoulder to shoulder.  All five of you, stand here 
against the wall.  One, two, three, four, five.  You know you’re 
standing next to your friend.  You’re perfectly safe.  Let’s do this.  
Place your feet together and just get into it.   
 
Igor: 
Just by talking about it, can you see Anthony getting more 
animated?  Can you see him get a little more commanding?  He is 
not commanding in terms of  “You will do this or you will be shot.”  
He's more like, “Just do it.  There’s no reason not to do it.”  The 
people who are on the cusp, remember there’s a window of 
opportunity before they leave.  They can’t stay in that ambivalent 
point too long.  They’ll go one side or the other.  Your job is to tip 
them to the side where they’re actually doing the hypnosis.  All it 
takes is to literally give them a clear instruction, a clear instruction 
with an emotional overtone that isn’t threatening in any way.  It’s 
supportive.  That way they don’t feel like, oh, I’ve got to run away 
now.   
 
Anthony: 
Sometimes – I learned this from, I got asked to do a stage hypnosis 
gig and I had a half an hour – not to prepare.  They said, “Your slot 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
235 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
is in a half an hour.”  Generally, I don’t get into my routines for that 
long, so it was a challenge.  I asked a well-worn Stage Hypnotist 
about this, it was at a University and he said, “Just make it 
competitive.  Have four chairs.  Tell them you’ve only got a half an 
hour and you only have four chairs.  It’s not like last time.  You’re 
looking for the people who are the best.  The people who have the 
best imagination, the people who are most up for a laugh, the 
people who are most up for having a lot of fun.”   
 
By the time I finished that, people were up and were ready and 
they wanted it.  I’m not saying that appealing to the competitive 
streak is right in every circumstance.  It isn’t.  But with those girls 
out there, all different ages, you’ve got the comfort – their mum is 
there.  Their auntie’s there.  Their sisters are there.  The cousins are 
there.  It’s just you can sometimes use a bit of that.  You can say, 
“I’m looking for the person here who is the most up for a laugh, the 
most up for using their imagination.”  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang 
and just get into it; even if you have to say, “This is not hypnosis.”  
Because it is not at that point, as far as they’re concerned.  It gives 
them the comfort and they’re hooked in.  Suddenly your odds have 
increased massively.   
 
Igor: 
Some of these things are performer secrets that you’ve heard us 
talk about several times over the last two days.  We’ll carry on and 
talk about them anyway.  A lot of these things will come to you as 
you do the training, so right now you’re nodding your head and 
going, “This is true.”  Then you’ll blank it out at the actual moment 
of impact when you actually have to do it because you’re so busy.  
 
 
Phases of Development 
 
Igor: 
It’s like driving a car.  Remember the first time you drove a car?  
You had to think about your gear, your shift, your mirror and all this 
stuff.  If you’re anything like me, I was driving around at one mile an 
hour with a bucking bronco.  No one told me cars were animals.  
Then over a period of time, it became automatic doing those things, 
smoothing out.  So then you could do everything else, you could 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
236 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
watch the road.  You could talk to your friends.  It didn’t become so 
much of a hassle.   
 
The reason I mention this now is because we’ve given you lots of 
pieces that fit into this vehicle.  I want you to remember those 
pieces.  They’re very important.  We’ll go over them again in a 
moment’s time to get them clear inside your head.  Here’s why.   
 
Up until this point, you’ve been busy scrambling to get to the point 
to where you’re doing good solid hypnotic effect on the streets, 
right?  We’ve been pushing you to get there because; we don’t 
need your intellects too involved with this.  Those are the things 
that slow you down and hold you back.  We just need you getting 
into your instincts about people and hypnosis.  What ends up 
happening is, you’re in this situation and it’s all happening and it’s 
live and you can’t believe it’s working and you get so excited.  That 
enthusiasm, by the way, is a great thing to maintain.   
 
The problem is right now, because more of your attention is 
required to keep it all going, you’re deleting.  You’re actually 
becoming negative hallucinator’s in terms of the rest of the world, 
right? How many of you, whilst you were actually working with a 
hypnotic subject, was even aware that other people were 
watching?  Just one or two of you?  How many of you realized how 
large the group was, you looked up and were like, “Hang on a 
second.  Where did all these people come from?”  What’s 
happening there is that you’re so engaged in what you’re doing that 
it’s shutting down other functions.  You don’t have enough 
attention left for these things.  That’s fine.  That’s kind of where 
you’re right now.   
 
What’s important to realize is, you want to get through that phase 
as quickly as possible because there are other things that you need 
to bear in mind.  For example, many of you are dropping your walk 
up introduction, the compliment.  How many people did the 
compliment when they were introducing themselves today? 
 
Anthony: 
A few people did.  A few times it turned into a bit of a chase.  “Uh, 
do you want to be hypnotized?  You want to be hypnotized? I’ll 
hypnotize you!”  It’s kind of like they’re gone.  They’ve gone

already.  If you got to engage someone and Marcus just made this 
point – this very valid point – if you’re going to ask someone for 
directions, you wouldn’t run after them and say, “Do you know 
where the station is?”  You wouldn’t get any directions.  You would 
get their field of view.  You’d open up to show that there is no harm 
here, no threat here.  You’d say, “Excuse me.”  You’d gesture and 
you’d expect the people to stop.   You say, “Excuse me.  Can you 
help me?  Do you know the way to the train station?”  Unless 
they’re very rude, you’d expect to get directions.  That’s the speed.  
That’s the manner.  That’s the attitude.  That’s the demeanor that 
you need to carry into this, rather than into a race, chasing after her 
or her.   
 
Igor: 
We understand why it’s happening, it’s just a natural phase of 
where you’re right now.  You get excited.  There is a little bit of 
anxiety still involved in that excitement.  It’s a kind of mix of things 
and so on.  What we’re just letting you know is it’s fine where you 
at, and, get yourself through that phase as soon as you can.  That’s 
where the real cool stuff that happening – do you want to add 
something? 
 
Audience Member: I don’t know if I’m actually there, but I did take your observation to 
heart that I was – 
 
Anthony: 
It was much better. 
 
Igor: 
It was loads better. 
 
Anthony: 
It was loads better.  You were standing back.  Let me say something 
because the lady you were working with had two daughters or 
whatever, nieces, nephews.  I stood next to them at one point and 
you were standing back.  You were being more open and obviously 
you were aware of the crowd at that point.  I said to her, “Is that 
your mum?”  She said, “No, that is my Auntie.  I don’t know what is 
going on.”  That was still because she still couldn’t’ actually hear 
what you were saying.  
 
Audience Member: Oh god.  I felt like I was – 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
238 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Anthony: 
You were.  But that’s how audible we’ve got to be.  Look in her 
direction.  It’s going to sharpen her attentiveness. 
 
Audience Member: When I did the arm bar, I had the girls come over to do the arms. 
 
Anthony: 
You did great.  I’m just saying even as great as you did, there were 
moments there where they still didn’t quite know what was 
happening.  There’s another example that I’m going to point out.  
You’re doing the hypnotism and then it is like she’s there.  She’s 
been leaning on your shoulder for two or three minutes now and 
not a great deal has been going on.  Her arm might have gone up 
and down again.  Even that, which can be a routine, and can be 
funny, isn’t a routine unless you’re performing it for an audience.  If 
you got your arm out, test it.  If you test it and it is stuck, open your 
eyes and look at it.  Ask them a question.  Look at everyone.  
Engage other people.   
 
Igor: 
Tonight, when we are finished with the street approaches for 
tonight, I strongly recommend to all of you, especially now that 
you’re in London, that you head down to Covent Garden.  There’s a 
big square.  I will point out where it is to you, if you want.  You have 
lots of street performers there.  I’d like you to observe the street 
performers and you’ll see something.  They’ll have mikes on. They’ll 
have boom boxes.  Some will just use their voice.  Even though 
they’re shouting, even though their gestures are very big and slow, 
you’ll have to watch them for ten minutes before you have any idea 
what’s going on.  You’ll go, “What’s he doing?  Is he a singer?  A 
juggler? A break-dancer?  A magician?  A comedian?”  You just 
don’t know.   
 
The reason for it is several fold.  Number one it’s a big space.  
Having your voice fill a big space is an art all in itself.  We could 
spend a week just doing voice coaching just to get that voice 
projecting.  Open air swallows up sound.  Closed spaces allow you 
to project sound more easily.  Then there’s the idea of crowd 
mentality.  People are coming in.  They’re already confused because 
they’re just coming in, it’s new and it’s novel.  So if they don’t know, 
that confusion is going to persist until a clear moment pops them 
through that confusion.  They think they can’t hear you.  It’s just 
that it’s not making sense because it’s being filtered through that 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
239 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
layer of confusion.  Then you have social insecurities, will I be 
expected to do something?   
 
Is he coming to me?  If you don’t believe me about this, then, again, 
when you get to Covent Garden tonight stand right in the front row 
where you make eye contact with the performer.  At that point, I 
guarantee you; the minute he looks at you, you’re going to go, “Is 
he going to pull me out as a volunteer?  I don’t want to go as a 
volunteer.”  Those normal social things come up.  Those are the 
exact same issues that your audience is going to go through 
whether it’s in a bar or on the street or anywhere else.  So turning 
around, I don’t mean to pick you out as an example because you 
actually did a great job, beautiful, picture perfect piece of 
demonstration.  The dynamic was interesting which is why it is 
useful to bring out, if that is okay with you.   
 
We had a mother and a daughter and a niece or something.  It 
appears as if they’re going shopping, a normal shopping trip.  He did 
absolutely the right thing.  He refused to hypnotize the daughters 
because they’re all under age.  I hope you realize whether it’s male 
or female underage hypnosis is a bad thing.  If their parents are 
there, it’s probably a bit more acceptable, but even then, you just 
want to stay clear of it.  If they’re under eighteen or look under 
eighteen, walk away.  Tell them something nice and then deal with 
that.  Most countries, rightly so, are very protective of young 
people.  There’s all kinds of issues that come with that.  It can be 
misconstrued in all kinds of ways.  Don’t even open that can of 
worms.  You did the right thing by not – 
 
Anthony: 
Somebody else had to walk away after about ten rejections because 
the group was all around the age of eighteen.   
 
Igor: 
Now look at it from the point of this little girl.  She is out with her 
auntie.  She’s maybe fifteen.  Some guy brings them in.  She’s like, 
“What’s this?  What is going on?”  She doesn’t really know what is 
going on and suddenly her auntie is like this.  What did she think?  
The authority figure, the person that is supposed to be protecting 
her on the streets of this big city is out of action.  She hasn’t heard 
properly what is going on.  Maybe she has heard a bit, but she 
doesn’t know where to put it inside her mind or what it means.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Anthony: 
I think it may have been that.  I’m thinking about the exact phrase 
she used.  It may have even been that she didn’t quite understand 
what is going on and what the woman’s role was or whatever.  
 
Igor: 
So now her primary care giver, her primary protector is out of 
action.  She doesn’t know what it means.  There’s no frame fit 
around it that says it is all-safe, this is all good fun.  You’ll have a 
great time.  By the way, put the same girl in within all her school 
friends and let’s give a couple of extra years for legal sake, like in 
High School, you’re doing a Stage Hypnosis Show, these are your 
best subjects ever.  But because the context has defined safety and 
fun for them already, your job is to define that for them.  Safety and 
fun. Safety and fun.  Although it may seem obvious to you, it’s not 
just a question of saying, “This is safe and fun,” and then carry on.  
It’s everything that you do.  If I go, “This is safe and fun.”   
 
The context will go against that.  If I’m doing some hypnosis stuff 
and  I go, "This is safe and fun, guys.”  I’m going through here.  
Again, it is not quite right.  But if I’m doing hypnosis and I’m saying, 
“This is cool, guys.  Come in close.  It’s okay, you can touch him.  
Make sure that you can hear me.  Can you hear me?  Let me do 
this.”  And so on.  I’m taking care of them, aren’t I?  “Can you guys 
hear me okay?  Do you want to come in closer, so you can see this?  
Now, watch this arm.  Look what has happened to his arm right 
now.  Come and touch it.  It’s okay.  He won’t bite you.”  What is 
the sub communication that is going on?  What is the context that 
I’m actually saying?  I’m taking care of you, aren’t I?   
 
Anthony: 
It shows that you’re in control.  There’s a context.   
 
Igor: 
And that I’m concerned for your well-being.  I want you to get 
something out of this.  That concerned for your well-being which I 
am demonstrating indirectly by suggesting to come in close and 
being a little bit more maternal in my style and so on.  That’s telling 
you that you’re going to be looked after on some level.  Does that 
kind of make sense to you guys?  That’s the other reason why it is 
so important to engage with your audience as quickly as possible.  
That turns the whole atmosphere around into like, “Wow, this is 
amazing.  This is the best thing ever.”  You can see a master of this 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
241 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
at work up at Covent Garden.   Watch the street performers.  Some 
are terrible.   
 
Actually, to be honest with you, I’ve learned most of my group 
dynamics from watching them do bad things that made me feel 
uncomfortable.  I’m thinking, “What’s he doing wrong?  I don’t 
want to do that to people.”  Then you see someone who’s 
masterful and you’re like, “Wow, that is amazing.”  At first it’s going 
to be difficult to judge what he is doing because you’re so involved 
in the process.  But afterwards, especially if you contrast the two 
performers, you’ll go, “I get it. This guy was being like this.  This 
guys was being like that.”  This is not a skill you’ll develop over 
night.  Some of you have already got it instinctively.  You’re very 
close, for example.  But for some us, we’ll need more input.   
 
We’ll have to see performers doing their thing, getting involved 
with people and so on.  We’ll develop a feel for it, a sense of how to 
do this.  Does that make sense to you guys?  The key thing that I 
want you to remember in this whole process is as you work your 
way up that ladder, you always want to keep your basics, your 
fundamentals foremost in your mind.  Am I doing the approach 
correctly?  There are only five steps to the approach, right?  Am I 
running my routine smoothly? They’re just fairly mechanical.  Am I 
aware of safety on a purely physical level?  Some of you were 
starting to hypnotize someone with a great big dump truck starting 
to come down the road.  All you have to say is “Move to one side 
for a minute.”  Again there is nothing wrong with it.   
 
It’s just you’re just so hooked into what you’re doing, you lost track 
of your environment.  You look up and you’re like, “Yeah, that 
truck.  It is going slowly.  It doesn’t look like it is speeding down the 
lane, but in half an hour when they’ve cleaned out the rubbish from 
this area, they’ll probably want to come down this way and I might 
not be done yet.  It only took us three steps across and then you’re 
free again.  Just keep these things inside your mind as you go along 
and you’ll do really well.  It’s your responsibility.  We’re not going to 
be out with you very much longer.

Tips for the Street 
 
Igor: 
Tonight when you’re out with your tribe, as we like to call them 
now - you’ve been so fixated on what you’re about to do, you’ve 
lost the person next to you.   
 
Remember, you should be chatting.  You should be having fun, 
finding out about each other and so on.  If you’re standing around 
looking for something to do, which part of your mind are you 
engaging?  It’s the wrong part. If in doubt – here’s a general rule of 
thumb, especially in here, hopefully you’ll take this along with you 
when you go home and you work with your friends and other 
people – if you’re standing around for more than say five seconds, 
silently, not saying anything, turn to your nearest person in your 
tribe and say, “Put your hands out like this. The other hand.”  You 
go through a little routine with them, even if it’s only a two-minute 
routine.  They’ll do it with you and then okay let’s hang out for 
another five seconds.   
 
Then you’ll do another thing, and another thing.  If in that process a 
crowd starts building, so much the better.  The point you’re now 
having momentum.  When someone has done a piece and come 
back, don’t just go, yah, just go, “Wow, that’s amazing.  I really 
enjoyed when you did this or that.”  You have to start offering 
support.  Not just soliciting it like, “How did I do?”  Your job is to 
offer that support to each other, because otherwise you’re too 
much in your own head, too much in your own stuff.  If you’re 
waiting to give feedback to someone, if your waiting to tell them 
how well they’ve done, if you’re waiting to give someone an 
instruction like stand over here and put your hands like this, that 
switches on your performance mind.  That’s the mind that you want 
to have on.  If you just hang around going – 
 
Anthony: 
Another decent example when we were out there was Stephan did 
as far as I could tell textbook, perfect French textbook.  It was 
perfect, but she was hugely unresponsive.  Not for any challenge, or 
lack of understanding, she just didn’t have that physical connection 
even, magnetic fingers took a minute and a half.  Everything about 
her was at peace and happy, and I’m up for it, I’m doing my best, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
243 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
but you stuck with it.  You did both exercises, did an induction, and 
pushed and at that point I was thinking, “Yes, this isn’t going 
anywhere.”  That’s when Stephan needs to see some love.  That’s 
when you need to say, “That was textbook.  You were just unlucky 
there.  It’s not you.  It’s her.”  That’s kind of how it is.   
 
That’s kind of how I feel about it.  It’s not you.  Because a fair 
number of you had some success last night, some of you had a few 
successes on the bounce; it can be a little demoralizing when you 
only got four or five.  You don’t even get to speak to anyone.  Part 
of the reason for that is that you’ve forgotten your approach from 
last night.  You’re running.  You’re chasing. I just want to get to the 
hypnosis.  No.  Relax.  Be a professional.  Engage.  Open.  Be a 
magnet.  It’s simple.  You’ll get it again. It is a bit a confidence game 
as much as a numbers game.  Things like I use ideomotor 
movements in therapy.  I train people to use the same stuff you’ve 
been learning, but to use it in the therapy room.   
 
It’s one of those things that when they leave the course, that’s their 
expectation, that people’s arms levitate and twitch.  They generally 
get it.  If you don’t get it, first session, second session, then you 
probably won’t get it in the third session.  You might have to refine 
what you do.  You might have to revisit the technique.  You might 
have to change your language.  Then you get one.  Then the next 
one is easy and the next one.  How that confidence is picked up on, 
I’m not quite sure.  The words seem to be the same.  The action 
seems to be the same.  It does make a difference.  I keep giving 
different analogies.  The person in the call center who is getting 
no’s and go away’s all day, all day, all day.  That can be massively 
demoralizing unless you frame that every rejection, one step closer 
to the yes.   
 
However you’re going to do it, it’s the same.  I think some of you 
approached ten different people out there and you got rejections 
every time.  Revisit your approach and look at it again.  That’s fine.  
If that’s all good and intact, then you just had a bit of bad luck.  
Keep going.  Persistence will pay.  You will get someone.  
Confidence will grow.  Next person.

Igor: 
Now back to this idea of this tribe, this is so important.  You’ve had 
a lot of experiences in here already with hypnosis.  Would it be fair 
to say that they were enjoyable and relatively successful?  Would 
that be fair to say?  A little more feedback would be good from 
most people.  We’ve three people who are saying, “Yeah.”  
Everyone else is going, “Hypnosis?  I thought this was knitting.”  
You’ll also have noticed that when you have worked with people as 
a subject, there are certain things they did that you preferred.  That 
you liked.  There were some things they did you didn’t like, but you 
went through with it anyway because the context meant that you 
couldn’t ignore it.  There were some things that were in-between.   
You didn’t care either way.  Is that fair to say?  Learn from these 
moments, folks.   
 
If someone has approached you and you didn’t like it.  It felt a little 
awkward.  I don’t know why.  He was a bit in my face and I didn’t 
like that so much.  What makes you think you should go out on the 
street and do the same?  If you’re going to repeat the same physical 
things that made you feel uncomfortable, chances are, it’ll do the 
same for other people, do you see where I’m going with this?  The 
reason I say this again is that I see a really valuable resource being 
slightly wasted out on the streets when you’re not doing your 
practice runs with your friends.  Why?  Because it’s not just like you 
do your thing and I’ll just hang out here for a while because I’m 
being nice.  You’re missing the point.  Whatever he’s doing with 
you, the things you like, go, “That’s a good one.  I like that.  I’m 
going to steal it.”   
 
Trust me, the police will not come after you for stealing these 
things.  By the same token if he is doing something that you makes 
you feel uncomfortable, say, “Hang on a second.  I’ve been doing 
that to people too.  I’ve been doing this kind of hypnosis all along.  I 
don’t like it.  Why would they?”  Then you get to adjust your own 
approach a little bit.  Does that make sense to you guys?  It won’t 
work if you just stand there, brain off and do your thing because 
then you’re not engaged in the process anymore.  I’m not saying 
you analyze the way he puts his little finger up.  I’m not talking 
about that kind of analysis.  Just go with the experience and that’s 
nice.

That makes me feel really good.  My god, I really like that hand 
thing.  Now, just as my hand starting moving he said something and 
that really made it better for me.  Steal these gems.  This is really 
where I got most of my knowledge from.  Believe it or not, I expect 
you had a similar experience most great hypnotists cannot not 
teach.  I’m sorry it’s true.  The ones I’ve seen are fantastic at what 
they do.  But if you try and do what they say the do, you’ll get no 
results.  If you actually do what they do, you’ll get great results.  It’s 
just they think they’re doing one thing, but they’re doing another.  
It gets a little bit confusing sometimes.  By the way, they’re some 
great hypnosis teachers out there as well.   
 
I’m not trying to suggest that they’re all terrible.  The point is that 
they pick these things up.  They do something to you and you go, 
that I really like.  You go away and you play with that.  You polish 
that for a while.  One of the best lessons I learned was from a 
hypnotist who actually was not very good at all.  Really.  He should 
have been a terrible hypnotist, but he had this infectious 
enthusiasm.   It had better results than I did.  I thought, “This 
shouldn’t work.”   
 
That’s when I started realizing this idea of H+ is the idea of your 
attitude is so important.  You don’t get these things until you look 
for them. When you’re just standing around on a street corner 
going ho, hum, you’re missing a vital opportunity for experience.  
Do you see where I’m going with this?  If I was to make a 
recommendation for tonight, and this is only an idea, you don’t 
have to accept if you don’t want to.   Then even after you’ve gone 
out with each other and you’ve done your thing and so on, hang out 
with each other.  Go to dinner with each other.  Over dinner chat 
with each other.  Get to know each other.  Build that emotional 
bond where that support comes from.  Then half way through, get 
up and do an approach.  “Hi Guys, you look like you’re having a 
great meal here.”  The other guys go, “Yeah, that’s all right, but I 
don’t know I felt a little bit like you’re interrupting my conversation 
here, not quite sure why.”  But isn’t that valuable feedback from 
your friends?  Now you start to build up.   
 
You go, “Okay, let me try this way.”  “Hi Guys.”  “Hi Guys.”  “Hi 
Guys.”  The point is that you’re starting to vary your behavior a little 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
246 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
bit.  You’re getting a little bit of feedback.  As other people do the 
same things to you, you’ll suddenly go, “Oh I get it.  I was doing 
that.”  Because just telling you will often not be enough.  When 
someone does the same thing, even though they know not to do it, 
they’ll go, “Oh I see it now.”  Then someone does something that 
was like, “That was good.  I want to do that.”  It tells your 
unconscious to refine and tweak the behavior.  All those bits start 
becoming more and more shaped over time until it’s an irresistible 
thing.  Does that make sense?   
 
Anthony: 
Just remember the comment I said on day one about the anchoring. 
And you’re rubbing your hands like you’re trying to start a fire. 
You’re not actually getting into the state, but you’re hoping that 
you’re going to conjure this up.  The equivalent to that for some of 
you who have been out there doing this is just touching too much.  
I’ve said that I want to get close.  I want to be in that person’s 
personal space and feel comfortable.  I want to be in that area, so 
that it is not aimed at one individual.  It’s just one of those things.  
When you see a stiff arm going on and you’ve done this, and you’ve 
done the elbow and now it’s become this, this and this. That’s not 
going to make the arm go stiff, it’s now become another little life 
buoy, another little (hands rubbing) come on, work for me, keep it 
there, keep it there.  It’s the same thing.  If you see someone else 
and you think – I’m not asking you to completely annihilate 
someone else’s work or anything.   
 
If you see something and you think, “I think that would make me 
feel slightly uncomfortable.”  Then you can say, “Do it on me.  
Practice your stiff arm on me.”  “There’s no need to be touching 
here.  There’s no need to be going in my armpit.  There’s no need to 
be touching my bra strap.”  
 
Igor:  
 
For the guys! 
 
Anthony: 
That’s the kind of thing, that you can have someone and they’re 
relaxed.  They’ve let themselves go and they’re physically trusting 
you, but they don’t like hands on their neck.  They don’t like people 
touching their hair.  Your hands smell because you didn’t wash 
them after you had that sandwich earlier.  Your breath smells and 
now you’re right in their face.  Simple, personal hygiene.  Obvious

stuff.  I know that it’s patronizing to even say, but it’s easy to miss 
sometimes because you just ran out the restaurant and now you’re 
on the street doing what you wanted to do.  If you find yourself 
clinging onto something, let go.   
 
Igor: 
Let me just ask you.  Has this been useful in terms of a wrapping up 
of the stuff that we have been doing so far? Is this useful to you 
guys?  
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
The basic thing we’re saying here is just go back to basics again.  I 
know we all want to have advanced techniques.  We’re going to 
come onto some really cool stuff, some great gifts you can give 
people.  Tomorrow more of the language and how to do this stuff 
covertly as well.  This is a good point.  We are half way through the 
training.  It’s a good point to settle down and get back to basics.  
What am I trying to achieve. What am I doing with this thing? Why 
am I doing this?  Am I doing it the right way?  Am I approaching it in 
the right way?  In terms of the approach, what are the five basic 
rules of the approach?  What are we trying to achieve?  What is the 
first thing you have to do?   
 
Audience Member:  H+. 
 
Igor: 
H+, right?  The first thing is your attitude right?   
 
Now if you do it this way and you think of something kind, or if 
you’ve just had a joke with a friend and you use that energy to keep 
going.  I know one guy, who’s great performer, who’ll sit on the 
phone with his mates and he’ll just tell jokes with them, just to kind 
of warm himself up.  Then he’ll go, “I gotta go now.”  Click.  He 
walks on stage does his act.  It brings that vitality with his friends.  
He’s got a good vibe going.  Basically, his friends don’t know this, 
he’s having a chat with them, he’s amusing them, but really, he’s 
about to do his act.  It’s his way of warming up.  Don’t think that 
this is the only way of doing it.  The key is the emotion that you 
have.  Does that make sense to you guys?  It brings the emotional 
context for what you’re about to do.  What is the second thing 
you’re about to do?   A compliment, right?  Give me a compliment.

Audience Member: Nice shoes. 
 
Audience Member: You look confident today.   
 
Igor: 
You look confident today.  You see why “you look confident today” 
is that better than “Nice shoes?”  "Nice shoes" is not wrong, by the 
way.  What’s better about “You look confident today?” You see it 
for yourselves.  I could say, “I love your sandals.”  It’s nice, right.  
“You look like a really confident person.”  Which one affects you 
more?   
 
Audience Member:  The emotional one.   
 
Anthony: 
Personality.  Your identity.   
 
Igor: 
You want to talk about their personality, their identity, and their 
emotional part of their experience.  Those are the things that really 
effect people.  It doesn’t take that much.  You look confident.  You 
look like a nice person.  You look like a decent person.  You look like 
an intelligent person.  You guys seem to be having a lot of fun here.  
It’s a observation.  It is not a question.  You’re a confident person.  
You’re not handing the ball over to them.  That’s a really important 
in this.  Some of you are still doing it and I understand why.  Don’t 
hand that ball over.   
 
Anthony: 
Kev and I have had a bet ongoing for the last year, the first person 
to convert a Jehovah’s Witness.  Our wives are the skewer that 
stops this from happening.  Occasionally they’ll come around and 
say, “What do you think about divorce?”  Kev’s wife has actually 
busted his, so he’s got to work on a new one.  I’m quite tolerant of 
people that can manage to get in my space in that way.  It’s the 
same kind of thing.  Very often Mormons – those kind of door-
knocking, God-bothering, I’m going to give you my magazine, 
whatever – the way they get into you is that they ask you a 
question about – “I imagine security is important to you.  You’re a 
family man.”  Something that you cannot, not say yes to.    
 
“Is your family’s health and safety important to you?”  You’ve 
committed.  It is very difficult to shut the door in their face at that 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

point. I know it can be done. It is so much more difficult when 
you’ve just given the ball back and it comes straight back at you 
again.  What they really want to do is give you their bible magazine, 
whatever it happens to be.  It’s the same kind of thing.  “You look 
like a confident guy.”  There’s no ambiguity.  There’s no “Am I being 
chatted up?”  It’s just, “You look like a confident guy.”  “Fantastic.”  
It’s a different level.   
 
Igor: 
Do you here the levelness of the delivery? “You look like a confident 
guy.” Not asking for a response that is basically saying indirectly, 
“Please make me feel better by accepting my compliment,” versus 
“You look like a confident guy”,  just giving the compliment, a gift, 
an offer.  The key thing here and this is one of the most important 
things, especially for those of you who want to approach on their 
own, is you must keep going.  I’ve seen a lot of this, “Hi, you all right 
today?”  You see that three-second window?  Now they’re feeling 
uncomfortable and they’re gone.  It usually is just a second.  
Anyone have that happen to them so far?  The next one is, “Hi, how 
are you today?  You look all right.  You look like a decent, confident 
person.”  My facial expression says basically, “Please feed me.”   
 
Anthony: 
 Please accept me. 
 
Igor: 
 I need your validation, so basically this is not a real compliment.  
I’m offering it to you, so you can like me.  Do you see where I’m 
going with this?  “Hey, you look like you’re having a good day.  You 
look like just the right person for what we’re doing here today.”  If 
he walks on, do I care?  No.  “Have a great day.  Thanks a lot.”  You 
keep it rolling.  You don’t stop there either.  “You look like a real 
confident person.  I’m a hypnotist.  I’m performing here today.  Can 
I show you something amazing about how the mind works?” 
 
Anthony: 
Sure go for it. 
 
Igor: 
What’s the difference between that and saying, “You look like a 
confident person.  I’m a hypnotist.  I’m performing here today.  Can 
I show you a little something about hypnosis? Show you something 
about your hypnosis mind?” 
 
Anthony: 
Fell off the end of the pier there.

Igor: 
Do you notice how easy it is for me to derail?  I said essentially the 
same thing, didn’t I?  Can you feel the energy levels dropping and 
my words got a little bit confused.  I lost my own confidence, my 
own focus.  And also, there’s nothing of value.  If I say, “can I just 
show you something cool about how your mind works?”  I’m 
showing you.  “Do you want to take part in a hypnosis 
demonstration?”  Who’s doing all the work now?  Who feels put 
upon now?  Did you see the subtle shift that is going on?  You want 
to make it seem like it is going to be easy for them.  “All I need you 
to do is just stand there and listen.  Is that easy to do?” 
 
Anthony: 
I think I can manage that. 
 
Igor: 
“You can manage that? Okay, just stand over here, would you?”  Do 
you see how now we’ve slowly brought him into the whole thing 
and we’ve assuaged his fears and concerns and so on.  Does that 
make sense to you guys?  Good. 
 
Anthony: 
Five simple steps. 
 
Igor: 
What we want you to do now is really go back to basics.  We’re 
going to spend a minute or two on doing this.  I want you to go back 
to those basics and we’ll get rid of the chairs.  We’ll go into the gifts 
and the rest of the stuff later.  With all your experiences so far, I’d 
like you start right at the beginning again.  Get those basics down 
solid.  Give each other feedback like, “I like that.” Or “Actually I felt 
a little bit like I was being asked to do something I didn’t want to, I’ll 
go along with it, but it wasn’t quite there.”  Do you see where I’m 
going with this? 
 
Anthony: 
My aim when I’m out is that if the approach doesn’t result in them 
wanting to be hypnotized, but was an interesting thirty-second, or 
two minute conversation I’ll walk away from, I feel good.  If I get 
into this, but I’m struggling with that, I still walk away as a 
hypnotist.  I guarantee, they’re not walking away pointing at me 
saying he couldn’t hypnotize us.  That is my presentation.  I want to 
be able to entertain at a table, from walk up, to magnetic hands for 
the best part of ten minutes.  No problem.  I can move onto another 
table because that is how you can play it if that’s what you said you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
251 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
were going to do.  That’s what I’m saying I’m going to deliver. 
Interesting? Cool. See you later guys.  Done.  It’s one of those 
things.  Yes, sometimes it smarts a bit inside.  It hurts a bit when 
people just walk on.  Just refine what you do.   Go back to the basics 
again.  More space, more neutrality, more openness, more smiles.  
This is why he is doing so well. 
 
Igor: 
Zoran?  Would you do us the pleasure of approaching us like you 
did the people today?  I just want everyone – a little bit of pressure 
on.  Just watch his expressions. 
 
Anthony: 
He’s doing it already.  His eyes already – 
 
Igor: 
Do you see that?  Would you talk to someone like this?  Do you see 
how his eyes are lit up?  He’s got a smile on his face.  He looks 
friendly.  Compare his evil twin brother.  Who would you rather talk 
to?  Me, of course, because I’m wearing the nice suit.  Do you see 
where we are going with this?  He’s already won before he started.  
This is why we start with H+.  Is this making more sense to you 
now?  Especially now that you’ve been on the streets.  What I want 
to do – everyone just stand up and move your chairs to the side 
would you?   
 
I’d like to spend maybe ten minutes doing this.  That doesn’t mean 
you spend ten minutes with one person.  I want you to spend thirty 
seconds per person maximum just doing your walk up.  The idea 
here is that you’re going to go through to your first act of 
compliance.  Can you stand over here a second?  After that point, 
go no further.  You’re really going to look for the basics for the 
fundamentals.  When it’s your turn to be approached, you’re going 
to look for the same five basics inside them.  Does he have his H+ 
up?  Right now, it’s okay.  He’s interesting.  I’d give him the benefit 
of the doubt, but it’s not quite strong enough. 
 
Audience Member: I’m not Zoran.  I’m not at that Zoran level. 
 
Igor: 
Now, did you see that switch?  He got himself in that state and 
suddenly his eyes lit up.  His smile became more friendly.  He 
became more animated.  Now I’m going, “Oo.  What’s up? Yeah, I’m 
more interested now.”  Your job is to start watching the other 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
252 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
person when you’re the subject.  I want you to work with five 
people in five minutes.  That means literally going up and going “Hi.  
You look like a great person.  I’m a hypnotist.  I’m performing here 
today.  Can I show you something about how the mind works?” 
 
Audience Member: Yeah, cool.   
 
Igor: 
Just stand over here, would you?  Done.  That was fifteen seconds.  
Now it’s his turn.  I’ll turn around and he’ll approach me from an 
obtuse angle of some sort.  It doesn’t really matter where it is. 
 
Audience Member: Hey, how are you doing?  You look like a really good guy. 
 
Igor: 
Do you see?  Now he’s doing exactly the same thing to me.   
 
Audience Member: I’m a Street Hypnotist, a performer.  You look like you’d be perfect 
for what we’re doing here.  Would you like to play along? 
 
Igor: 
Sure. 
 
Audience Member: Awesome.  Step right over here. 
 
Igor: 
Notice.  You’ll have an emotional reaction to what he’s saying even 
though you know this is a set up.  I want you to notice that.  When 
he said, “We’re doing a show here today, do you want to take 
part?”  My first reaction was, “Whoa, I don’t know what is expected 
of me,” even though I know it that was a more gut level reaction.  
You can say, “ That was excellent, next time give me something 
valuable like give me an easy pay off, shall we say?”  Make sense?  
Then he’ll do it again with someone else and again and again.  After 
awhile you’ll start to notice, you animate only at the end and not 
the beginning.  You’ll start to get a feel for that.  Does that make 
sense to you guys?  Ten minutes.  Work with at least five people.  
It’s a short piece, but I want those five steps clear inside your mind.  
You’re looking for them from both perspectives.  Off you go.

Irresistible Arm Levitation 
 
Igor: 
Can I have a volunteer please?  Have a seat over there would you?  
I’d like you to put your hands on your lap for a moment now. 
 
Anthony: 
 I know where this is going now.   
 
Igor: 
Very good.  So we’re doing a little bit of a hypnotic thing here, some 
very cool things about how your unconscious mind just works.  
Initially I’m just going to warm you up, give your unconscious mind 
the freedom to do its thing.  Then we’re going to let is loose and let 
it do its thing.  Don’t try and help it.  Don’t try and resist it.  To start 
it all off, I want you to focus.  Focus on my palm.  You can feel my 
hand here, can you not?  What I want you to do is to really push my 
palm and try and lift it up. There you go.  I want you to put all your 
attention there.  What you’re doing right now is gathering your 
focus.   Keep going.  Keep going.  Lifting that hand.   
 
In a moment, I’m going to stop asking you to stop making an effort 
whatsoever.  I’m going to ask you to stop making any effort 
whatsoever.  Trust your unconscious.  The minute I ask you to stop 
and I remove my hand, this hand will lift up and touch your face all 
by itself.  You’ll see the unconscious mind work all by itself.  C’mon 
work harder.  Gain your focus.  Gain your focus.  The more focus 
you have right now, the better this will work.  Now stop.  Relax.  Let 
your unconscious mind work.  Notice the hand lifting up, all the way 
up, all by itself.  All the way up to your face, isn’t that amazing?  
Higher and higher.  When it touches your face, your eyes will close 
and you’ll take a deep breath.   
 
You’ll go into the deepest, most wonderful trance ever; meanwhile 
it’s the most amazing thing ever.  Have you ever had this happen so 
quickly and so easily?  It will touch your face in a minute and then 
you’re in for a world of wonderful, hypnotic adventures all the way 
down now.  All the way down.  Deeper, deeper, deeper still.  As you 
drift and glide through those wonderful experiences.  That’s 
fantastic.  I want you to know, this is one of the simplest things 
you’ll ever learn how to do.  Just go ahead and trust your 
unconscious and feel yourself build that internal connection and 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
254 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
we’ll come back to that in a minute.  Let the hand drift back to your 
lap as you continue deepening that journey.  Did you like that?  
Believe it or not, it’s virtually impossible for that to fail.  It’ll work 
one hundred percent of the time with one hundred percent of the 
people provided, and this is the one key thing, they follow your 
instructions, which is that they don’t resist the process.  That’s the 
only thing that will make this fail. 
 
Anthony: 
I’ve been trying to find a use – that was not what I was expecting at 
all. 
 
Igor: 
Now do you notice – ever done this as kids?  You stand in the door 
and you push your hands against the door and you step out and 
your hands want to float up.  What’s happening there is you’re over 
stimulating your muscles there and your muscles are lifting your 
arms?  They’ve got like an electric charge left over inside the 
muscles after you’ve stopped.  They’re over firing, which is why 
they want to lift up.  That’s basically what’s happening.  This is 
something that I came up with some years ago when I was still 
nervous about getting arm levitation and so on.  I really wanted it to 
work.  Then I went down the rehearsal route, which is a great route, 
by the way.  It works fantastically.   
 
This is the first time this has ever been unveiled in public.  I hope 
you like it.  Yeah, why not?  It’s all for you.  When you’re ready, 
bring yourself back feeling refreshed, revitalized, having this real 
profound connection with your unconscious, more importantly, 
being able to give others the same profound connection to their 
unconscious.  Only when you know you can do this, you’ll find 
yourself taking a deep breath in.  Your eyes will flutter open.  You’ll 
feel refreshed, relaxed, alert and simply fantastic, which is my catch 
phrase, of course.  It’s a really simple induction.  It’s virtually fool 
proof.  It’s one of the things that you can always do if everything 
else is failing.  You can do the eye roll, a nice visual thing for 
flopping someone down.  This I warn you right now, starts off as a 
cheat.  No qualms about it.  It starts off as an absolute cheat.  Do 
you see where it ends up?  How are you feeling?  You feeling good?  
You did an awesome job.  Wasn’t that an amazing experience?   
 
Audience Member: Yes it was. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Igor:   
Do you see that was from what should have been a cheat?  Give 
him a nice round of applause and make him feel good.   
 
Anthony: 
Stay there for a second.  Stay there for a moment.  On the back end 
of that, some of you will know as therapists.  Again, it’s not really a 
cheat, but it’s something that’s relatively straightforward to do.  
What I’d like you to is just place the very tips of your fingers on your 
trousers very, very lightly on your trousers like this.  So that your 
wrists are in the air and your forearms are in the air as if they’re 
kind of hanging there, just barely touching.  If you just do that for 
me, literally just the very, very tips of your fingers until they’re just 
about touching, just about feeling the texture of your trousers.  
Now close your eyes.  With your eyes closed, you can begin to relax.  
We’ve all had an experience of learning something new and you’re 
feeling comfortable.  An interesting thing is already beginning to 
happen.  In a moment, you’re already beginning to notice that one 
or both of your hands is beginning to lift up off your leg.  You’ll 
literally feel this as you pay close attention, barely touching.  In fact, 
now they have lifted up.   
 
One or both hands is getting lighter and lighter, higher and higher, 
pulled up toward the ceiling as if they’re pulled up on a wire. Higher 
and higher. Now, I want you to pay close attention to your hands.  I 
want you to try and figure out which on is feeling lighter and which 
one is feeling heavier.  When you realize which one is feeling 
heavier, you can allow that heavier hand to just drift down slowly as 
that other hand just hangs there and continues to drift up.  It could 
just continue to drift up and lift up all by itself, even as your eyes 
flicker, that hand becoming lighter and lighter and lighter.  You can 
notice how good it would feel if your unconscious now just to take 
complete responsibility and it can allow that arm to drift down only 
as quickly as you can drift up having had a profound insight into just 
how easy it is to tap into this resource you have called your 
unconscious.   
 
It will be there, even after you leave here.  Whenever you wish to 
return to this state of mind, all you need to do is sit quietly and 
repeat the word ‘relax’ four times in your mind.  The fourth time 
you repeat that word, you will immediately return to this state, the

most profound state of hypnosis you’ve experienced, any time it’s 
safe and appropriate to do so.  When your unconscious has gone 
ahead and made the adjustments, it will make this easy for you.  
Only as quickly as your conscience has accepted those changes, 
then and only then, will that arm drifts down.  As it drifts down 
slowly, you will drift back up to full consciousness, wakeful 
alertness, with a fresh understanding of just how powerful you are 
as a being.  You can go ahead and enjoy the happiness that you 
deserve.  Hello.  Thanks.   
 
Igor: 
Okay, we have about ten minutes before the break.  I want you 
guys to give either of the inductions a go whether it’s the irresistible 
arm levitation or it’s the more classic arm levitation. 
 
Anthony: 
Here you set it up about barely touching, just hanging on a wire 
there.  You emphasize that they’re touching, just barely touching.  
Literally a few lines, and you’re going to notice something 
interesting.  One or both of your hands is beginning to lift.  
Eventually, if you time it – again I am so confident that I can make 
that happen with suggest that I forgot to time my statements with 
his inhalations.  The point is that if he’s there and he’s inhaling, he’s 
going to get lightness and he’s going to lift.  You’re taking those 
millimeters and your turning them into centimeters.  You’re giving 
him this double bind of “I want you to pay close attention to which 
one is feeling lighter and which one is feeling lighter is what I’m 
essentially trying to saying – but which one’s feeling lighter and 
which one’s feeling heavier.” When you know which hand is feeling 
lighter, allow the heavier hand to drift down, only as quickly as…  
It’s very, very easy.  If I’ve got a tough subject, I find this a beautiful 
induction.  There’s no sleep and no hypnosis.  There’s concentrate 
and a natural response that you’re going to maximize.  
 
Igor:  
Do you notice how that’s basically doing the same process or 
principle that we’ve been using pretty much the last few days, 
which is you start slowly and you build it up.  Here we started with a 
cheat.  It sets the conditions.  Do we have his focus?  Yes.  Do we 
have his critical factor bypass?  Maybe, maybe not, who knows? 
Was his unconscious being stimulated? Not yet.  As soon as it 
released, something is happening, which was unusual. Was his 
critical factor bypassed? “Wow.”  Was his unconscious stimulated?  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
257 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Now it was.  Now we are basically piggy backing off a response into 
something else.   
 
Same thing here.  You’re setting this up.  When someone is barely 
touching their own legs, you’re basically saying indirectly is develop 
arm catalepsy.  It’s the only way that you can have your hands on 
here, right?  Then as it starts lifting and so on, you’re following this 
basic thing.  Their attention is there.  They’ll bypass the critical 
factor.  You’ll have the stimulation of the unconscious and you’re 
going through incremental steps as you go along.   
 
Anthony: 
The reason I like it as well is that you’ve got another load of 
moments you can play with.  When they leave, you can talk this 
hand down.  If I’m in therapy mode, I want to do quick diagnostic 
stuff with this.  That hand is going to drift down only as quickly as 
your unconscious goes over every single memory, experience, or 
event related to the problem.  This hand will only drift down only as 
quickly as your unconscious goes over every possible solution and 
outcome.  Your head will nod when you’re ready to go into 
hypnosis.  Simple.   
 
Igor: 
Okay.  We’ve got about ten minutes left to do this.  Find a partner.  
You’ll probably find this easiest if you’re sitting down.  It can be 
done standing up as well, but then you have to do that whole weird 
pressing against their thigh and it’s kind of weird.  Get a chair by all 
means or sit down on the ground.  Do you want me to go over the 
actual mechanics of it again or is it pretty straightforward?  It’s 
pretty straight forward, isn’t it?  Do you want to see it again?  Do 
you mind if I use you?  The first thing that you’re going to do is the 
set up.  Please put your hands on your lap.  I’m going to press down 
on this palm.  I’m going to put my body weight, especially if it is a 
big guy, I’m going to put my body weight on because he can’t lift 
my whole body with his arm.  I’m going to press against him for two 
reasons.  I want his focus on here and I want strain on this arm.  I’m 
going to be going for about twenty seconds.  That’s going to put on 
a nice potential on the arm.  Then I’m going to tell what is going to 
happen.   
 
In a moment, I’m going to ask you to stop and don’t make any 
effort.  Don’t resist what happens next.  Don’t assist what happens 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
258 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
next.   Just let it happen, your unconscious mind will lift that hand, 
move it all the way to your face.  At that point, you’ll be in a deep, 
pleasant trance.  In a moment, when I tell you to stop making any 
effort whatsoever, keep resisting, a bit more, a bit more, now that 
he’s getting a little tired.  That’s my sign that he’s ready to go.  
Don’t resist.  Don’t assist.  It’ll happen all by itself.  It will lift up and 
touch your face and you’ll have the most amazing experience.  
Ready, stop trying now.  The hand lifts up all by itself.  All by itself.  
Really straightforward.   
 
Anthony: 
 Oh, my God, oh my God Even now, I can feel it’s – 
 
Igor: 
By the way, it’s the same feeling that people have when they 
genuine catalepsy. It’s exactly the same feeling because similar 
mechanisms are at work.  Does that make sense?  Does that answer 
your question or do you want to see it again?   
 
Audience Member: Can I see the other part? 
 
Igor: 
Oh, from when he was up here?  Those are the gifts.  We’ll talk 
about gifts in a minute.  If you want to give someone a very simple 
gift, tell them to go down a trip down memory lane and find a 
wonderful experience and relive it.  Don’t tell them what it is.  “Go 
back to your fifth birthday party,” because yours happened to be 
good.  Just go through your experiences inside your mind and find 
something really positive to make strong right now.   
 
Anthony: 
Again, use the moments.  If you’re going to do this, trust me even 
when it was there, it still wanted to go.  It still had all the potential 
to carry on lifting.  Again, if you’re going to give a suggestion like 
that, I would always bind it in to that “In a moment that arm will 
drift down, only as quickly as you can fully relive and experience a 
wonderful event from your life, that you may have forgotten about, 
but you enjoyed.”   
 
Igor: 
For example, once his head is here and he’s in trance,  I say, “Now 
that’s great.  Now that hand will return to your lap only as quickly 
as you have that amazing experience and you’re reliving it fully. 
Feel it strongly in here. By the time it touches your lap, it will be full 
blown and you’ll know that it will be something that will be with 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
259 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
you for the rest of your life. Something positive.”  Does that make 
sense to you guys?  It’s really simple.  It’s really easy.  Make them 
feel good in whatever way seems instinctive.  Don’t try to do 
therapy.  Don’t try to find problems to solve.  We’ll talk about how 
to do that discreetly later on.   
 
Anthony: 
Don’t think of this as cheating.  I’d suggest that you try this.  It just 
popped into my head.  I really suggest that you try this.  We know 
what is going to happen, but from the inside it’s pretty convincing.  
That becomes all through the power of suggestion.   
 
Igor: 
The reason we’re showing this here is because this is not a therapy 
program here.  You know that, right?  This is a great out.  If nothing 
else is working, then sit down over here.  I know what’s going on.  
You’re standing up and all these people are watching.  Let’s find 
something where we can relax quietly.  Sit here.  Suddenly people 
are going to see this and [sound.]  Do you think that’s going to be 
convincing to everyone? It’s going to be convincing to them?  It’s a 
beautiful exit.  At that point, you can go, “Phew!  Time to go!”  
Enough of us talking.  Get up.  Find a partner.  Spend just, it literally 
just takes two minutes to do, so spend five minutes apiece and we’ll 
come back.  
 
 
Troubleshooting 
 
Igor: 
I’m not going to go through the induction just because we don’t 
want to involve the suggestion or the other elements.  Is it alright if 
I touch your hand?  Put your hand there.  Start lifting your hand a 
minute.  Notice how there is not that much effort going on right 
now.  There’s not a huge amount of muscle being engaged, which 
means the signals to the arm are pretty weak.  There’s no potential 
energy being stored up.  Now really lift it, really lift it like it meant 
something.  Keep trying to lift that and focus all your energy as you 
listen to me.  In a moment I’m going to ask you to stop trying 
anything.  Do not assist.  Do not resist.   
 
When I ask you to stop, I’m going to release your hand and it will 
naturally float up to your face.  When it touches your face, just 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
260 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
close your eyes and take a deep breath.  Keep lifting, properly.  
C’mon that’s it.  Close your eyes and go into a nice, deep, pleasant 
relaxed trance.  Keep lifting.  Keep all your attention.  Focus your 
mind.  Really lift.  Put some effort into it as much effort as you can 
right now.  When I ask you stop to making any effort, do not assist.  
Do not resist.  Just let it happen. It will lift up.  It will touch your 
face. Your eyes will close.  You can take that deep, healthy breath 
in.  Lifting up, that’s right, lifting up now.  You ready for this?  Stop 
trying.  Stop trying and let whatever happens happen.  That’s right.  
All the way up.  All the way up towards your face.  All the way up.  
Don’t assist, don’t resist.  Just let it happen by itself.  All the way up. 
A little bit more now.  You can do it.  You can feel it still wanting to 
lift, right?  Let it lift.  That’s it.  There you go.  Now it’s going.  Closer 
and closer. Closer and closer. Just a nudge in the right direction. 
Now we’ve got it, closer and closer.  Do you notice a little tap?  That 
just gave the unconscious mind a direction.  That’s it.  Get a little 
more.  You can do this. Let it happen all by itself.  Do not assist and 
do not resist.  Don’t try and prove anything to yourself.  It’s 
happening anyway.   
 
It’s already lifted up to here.  Just all the way to your face.  Focus all 
your attention.  Let it happen.  The elbow bending.   The shoulder 
lifting. The elbow bending. That hand getting closer to your face.  
You might even want to cheat at some point.  Your face may want 
to get closer, so you can get it more easily.  All the way to your face.  
That’s it.  A little closer now.  That’s it.  A little more.  That’s it.  Your 
eyes already want to close.  Your breathing has already shifted.  You 
want to feel that wonderful trance that’s coming,  I can tell.  All the 
way to your face.  The minute it touches I want you to hold on until 
the hand touches your face then you can release all the way into 
that trance.  You’re doing great.   
 
It’s really doing great work right now.  You can feel that connection 
with your mind and body occurring right now, can you not?  All the 
way to your face.  Lifting of your elbow.  Lifting of the arm.  All the 
way to your face.  At some point, it will touch some part of your 
face only you don’t know where that will be.  Will it be a chin?  Will 
it be your nose?  Will it be your forehead?  You simply don’t know.  
All the way to your face.  When it touches, you have rest and peace 
and comfort.  Your eyes will close.  You can finally drift all the way 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
261 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
to your face.  That’s right.  All the way.  Lifting, moving.  All the way.  
Closer and closer.  There you go.  The last few inches.  The wrist 
turning.   
 
All the way to your face now.  That’s it.  That last little nudge.  
You’re focusing.  You’re wondering, where will it touch?  Do you 
know yet?  Will it be that chin?  Will it be the side of your face?  Will 
it be your cheek?  Will it be your nose?  Who knows where it will 
touch?  All the way to your face.  A little closer now.  A little closer.  
There you go.  Fingers already starting to lift.  They want to get 
there.  They know how good it will feel once you finally get to relax.  
That little finger twitching wants to lift right along with it.  Why?  
Because it is so much easier when it touches the face.  You’ll be 
released from all of this effort.  All the way to your face.  That’s it.  
There you go.  There it goes.  All the way up.   
 
That’s a cheating finger, isn’t it?  It’s keener than you thought you 
were.  That’s your unconscious mind showing your mind how easy it 
is to go all the way into trance.  There you go.  Finger lifting, hand 
twitching, wrist turning, elbow lifting, face coming closer and closer.  
Will it touch?  Do you know where it is going to be yet?  I think you 
have a pretty good idea.  That’s right.  All the way.  Hang on for the 
touches.  Don’t close your eyes until it’s touched.  All the way to 
your face.  Finger lifting.  Elbow lifting.  Eyes wondering when can 
they finally close? That’s right.  All the way.  All the way now.  All 
the way. That’s it. All the way to your face. A little closer, a little 
closer now.  That’s it.  Close your eyes.  Close them all the way 
down.   
 
Don’t let that hand descend any more quickly than you can enter 
that wonderful deep trance that you’ve been wanting to experience 
for some time, perhaps.  Take the journey, as naturally as you need 
to.  Do you see I may have to work a little harder for it?  Did you see 
how the natural response took it there?  Then there was cognitive 
interference.  Some people do this.  They’ll think, “Oh, I don’t know 
if I make this happen.  Am I forcing it?  To some extent knowing the 
trick takes some power away from it because this is only a cheat 
and it will only take me this far.  Really you’re now adding a 
suggestion on top of that layer.   It’s like a ski jump.  You start off 
with momentum doing its thing. But eventually when you come off 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
262 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
the ramp, you’ve just hijacked all the experiences and you go flying.  
Ski jumpers are flying for a short period of time at least.  Does that 
kind of makes sense to you guys?   
 
Anthony: 
Good to see Igor working a little bit harder there.   
 
Igor: 
Yeah.  This is nothing you guys couldn’t do, isn’t it?   
 
Anthony: 
Just keep going.  It’s good to see.  You just keep going, re-firing the 
suggestion. 
 
Igor: 
This is about as hard as it will ever be for you guys.  Have you 
worked any harder for something?   
 
Anthony: 
Not for that, no. 
 
Igor: 
This is about has hard a case as you will ever get.  Was it really that 
difficult?  No.  Do you see how this works?  It’s a very natural, very 
simple, very easy induction and it looks like someone seems to be 
enjoying their trance, which is excellent.  You may as well create 
deep connections with your unconscious.  That’s where you really 
get to learn things.  You realize that, don’t you?  A deep connection 
is about what you learn, about who you’re and where your power 
comes from.  Your power as a human being.  Your power as a 
person.  Your ability to be a force for good in the world comes from 
that power you’re connecting to right now.  You can feel that, can’t 
you?  Nod your head if you can start to feel something develop 
inside.  Even if you don’t know what it is.  Just a feeling.  That’s it.  
There it is.  Just connect to that.  That hand won’t touch until there 
is a solid connection.  It doesn’t have to be a huge connection yet, 
just a solid one.  One that will continue through your process of 
your life of growing.  Like a little shoot that comes up from the 
ground.  In time, it becomes a bush, a tree.   
 
The mightiest oaks, the biggest trees all started from the tiniest 
seed.  At night when you sleep, that connection gets stronger and 
stronger.  Every single night, you can feel that connection, can you 
not?  Getting stronger already?  And you can expect that to 
continue, each night when you sleep and in your dreams, it’s 
getting stronger.  So you wake up in the morning going, “I don’t 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
263 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
know why, but I just feel better.  I feel more vital.  I feel more alive.  
Stronger.  More positive.” That’s because now you have that 
connection with your unconscious mind, a healthy connection, a 
good connection, a strong connection.  You’re feeling it right now, 
growing stronger, are you not?  That’s it.  All the way.   
 
When that hand touches your lap, feel free to come back out of 
trance.  Eyes open.  Feeling refreshed and revitalized.  Simply 
fantastic, but without seemingly, that something in the back of your 
mind inside your body that’s connected.  Growing stronger, 
especially when you don’t pay attention to it.  It’s there for you, the 
times when you really need it.  You know what I mean by that, 
don’t you?  That’s it.  All the way.  In your own time.  That’s it.  
You’re doing great. You’re doing great. It may take a little bit of 
time, which is fine.  Everyone does their own process in their own 
rate.  Do you think this would fit into the category of giving 
someone a hypnotic gift?   
 
Anthony: 
Yes.  An ability to have that connection. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly. Have I done therapy with this person?  Have I gone in and 
said, “Tell me about your mother.  Why do you want to have sex 
with your father? Is this not strange?”  We don’t have to go down – 
I know.  Freud was a little bit bizarre, wasn’t he?  You may as well 
add that connection, it’s okay to have a good time, don’t you think? 
That connection is about who you’re.  Sometimes that part of you 
that can have a great time, who can smile and laugh and just see 
the ridiculousness of things.  That’s the strongest part of you.  You 
know it’s been there for you in the past, don’t you?  That’s right.  
May as well throw that into the connection as well.  It is an 
important part of who you’re.  I can tell because you really light up 
when you smile like that.  Something important is going on there.  
That’s it.  All the way.  Good job.  Welcome back.  Not bad for – 
sometimes the induction doesn’t work for me.  Sometimes it has to 
fail.  What can you do? 
 
Anthony: 
Keep going as you did.  What can you do?  Keep giving suggestions. 
 
Igor: 
This was kind of a nice demonstration, so thank you for doing that 
by the way, because it illustrates what we’ve been talking about 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
264 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
before.  Remember when we said just keep going?  Oh my god, I’m 
abreacting. What do you do? 
 
Audience Member: Stay calm! 
 
Igor: 
Oh my god, I’m abreacting. 
 
Audience Member: Stay calm! Don’t touch. Scene fades. 
 
Igor: 
Try that again.  This is awful.  Then what do you do? 
 
Audience Member: Bring them back out. 
 
Igor: 
Okay.  I’ll accept that.  The test is coming.  That kind of insistence is 
exactly the kind of insistence you’ll have to have in those kinds of 
situations.  Saying it once typically will not be enough.  It may be 
sometimes.  Typically it will not be.  You need insistence.   You need 
to keep going.  You need to keep adding stuff and you need to keep 
that level of calmness and so on going.  Does that make sense? 
 
Anthony: 
That technique having only done it once five minutes ago.  You did 
make this point, but it could easily be lost.  What I think is really 
important about it is that you get that final bit of pushing just 
before you start.  You can feel that they start to give in.  It is getting 
tiring and boring.  You’ve kind of given out the procedure of how it 
is going to be. It’s like keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing; 
now stop pushing. It’s important to just load it up again just before 
the end there.   
 
Igor: 
As they get more tired, they’ll stop putting more effort in which 
means that the potential in the arm is now receding.  That’s why by 
the time that they relax the arm, now it’s relaxed.  Believe or not, 
it’s going to be harder for the arm to lift at that point because it’s 
used up a lot of its energy, its glucose or whatever makes the 
muscles move.  You want the push.  You want the extra push.  The 
other additional advantage – you saw it happening here is as 
they’re pushing extra, where is all their attention going?  All their 
intellect is now engaged in the activity, so when you present the 
suggestion there’s less room left to analyze or reject it or alter it.  
Isn’t that your experience?  You heard it.  You’re not really thinking 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

about it too much because this is taking so much effort.  That’s just 
part of how it works.  So, we’re really going for a break right now.  
Let’s just take a quick break here for ten minutes if that’s okay with 
you guys.   
 
 
 
 
DVD #15 – London – Part 2                              
4 Hypnotic Gifts That Will Have                     
People Loving You 
 
 
Two Hypnotic Gifts 
 
Igor: 
The stuff that you guys are doing without thinking about it, most 
hypnotists, even with twenty, thirty years of experience, would be 
terrified of even trying.  Will you not say that is the case? 
 
Anthony: 
I’d say that is a fact.   
 
Igor: 
It is a fact.  Most hypnotherapists are terrified of even attempting 
stuff that you guys are doing routinely.  Things like this or that.  
They’ll tell you, “Oh, that stage hypnosis, I can tell you exactly how 
that works.”  “Will you do it?” “Oh no.  It’s unethical to make 
people’s fingers come together.  It’s really bad.” 
 
Anthony: 
Ask them.  Can you hypnotize me?  Can you hypnotize me now?   
 
Igor: 
Oh I don’t know.  Maybe you should come to the office.  Basically I 
don’t want to slay the professional people, in their profession, I 
think they do a great job and it’s very valuable.  I just want you to 
have a perspective of where you are at in the field.  Right? Are you 
great therapists?  Unless you have the training, you probably are 
not?  Are you great conversationalist hypnotists?  Unless you have 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
266 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
the training, you probably are not.  But do you understand 
hypnosis?  I think you understand hypnosis better than most 
hypnotists do.  Seriously, I do.  Can you necessarily do it as well as 
everyone?   
 
No, that’s just a question of refining stuff and getting it a little bit 
smoother.  You have the platform, the mechanisms inside of you to 
be amazing hypnotists with a little bit of practice.  I’m talking about 
days and weeks rather than months and years.  I need you guys to 
appreciate and recognize about where you are at.  You’ve worked 
hard for this and really deserve it.  So, let’s start the day off with 
giving yourself a nice round of applause.  You have done this.  You 
have quite a bit of experience, Paul.  Would it be fair to say that 
we’re not just trying to make people feel good?  This is really a 
reflection of the industry.   
 
Audience Member: Yep.  Absolutely. 
 
Anthony: 
I certainly don’t have any secrets when I’m training.  You ask me a 
question; I’ll answer the question.  I know this stuff.  I know arm 
levitation.  I know another finger twitching.  It’s all becoming very 
normal.  The first time I made someone experience that I was 
completely rushing, completely overwhelmed.   
 
Igor: 
I was terrified. 
 
Anthony: 
I was terrified too.  I spent a lot of years thinking about that and 
trying to get it.  How do you do it?  You’re coming in at that level.  
You’ll expect it.   
 
Igor: 
It’s routine. 
 
Anthony: 
It is routine because it should be.  We’re putting the hypnosis into 
hypnotism as opposed to squeezing in out.  Unfortunately, that’s 
what a lot of courses do just to make it easier for you to stomach. 
We haven’t actually done it. Yeah, I can read that and yes it’s 
comforting. Yeah, I felt really relaxed that time. I was really deep 
that time. How do you know? I mean, how do you know?

You know we had a little email exchange.  Robin asked me what we 
were going to do in the course.  “I’ve already trained in 
hypnotherapy.”  I just said, “How do you know your people are 
hypnotized?”  “What do you mean?”  “Do you test your work?”  
“What do you mean?”  “Do you use any motor signals, catalepsy, 
amnesia?”  “Yeah.”  “Oh good.  You test your work then.”  That puts 
him in a very small percentage of hypnotherapists that I meet.  
Most just say, “Oh, because I did an induction.” 
 
Igor: 
That’s like saying, “I can read out loud.”  That’s it.  Next person.   
 
Anthony: 
Yes? 
 
Audience Member: The best one is, “Because I know.” 
 
Igor: 
The best one is, “Because I know.”  I know, OK. So, without 
belaboring that point too much, I want you to recognize that you 
have worked hard.  You have put yourself emotionally on the line.  I 
appreciate that.  It’s not easy to do it in here, let alone on the 
streets with people walking past and so on.  But you guys have 
done it.  You have put yourself on the line.  You’ve put yourself out 
there.  Even if you haven’t had as many successes on the streets as 
you would like, you’ve had great successes in here.  It puts you at 
the very top percentile of our profession.  If you take that same 
general skill set and lay on top of it things like hypnotherapy, you’ll 
become a great therapist.  Or showmanship, you’ll become a great 
showman.   
 
In terms of the skill set, you have a fantastic vehicle right now.  Just 
for me, I wanted you guys to appreciate that because it’s not every 
day that you see people with your skill set.  It took me a good six 
years of frustration and massive insecurities to even get close to 
what you guys can do right now.  I mean that absolutely.  Six years 
of seeing the best and getting insecure, trying something out and 
failing, kind of getting it right and having a rush, then having a 
dramatic failure and all the rest of it.  I wasn’t even close to where 
you guys are right now.  So just appreciate the fact that you have 
worked hard and you have learned it.

The next thing we want to do now is that we want to take that core 
hypnotic skill and start using it for something.  Those of you know 
me; I like to use hypnosis really as a force for good in people’s lives, 
in your own personal life, in other lives and other people’s lives.  It 
is what Antony was talking about with random acts of kindness.  
You do it with strangers.  You can do it with friends.  You can do it 
with family.  What we are talking about is giving what I call hypnotic 
gifts.  They are little gifts that you can give to people, which doesn’t 
force anything on them.  It’s not like, “Oh, I think you should stop 
smoking.  Stop smoking.”  That’s imposing your worldview on 
someone else.   
 
However, on the other hand, there are tons of people putting out a 
cry for help even though they don’t realize it; they’re sitting there 
like suddenly with floods of tears going on. “Oh my god, life is 
terrible.”  Really, that is an appeal for help, isn’t it?   
 
But if it’s your mother, or someone that you’re dating or someone 
like that, you can’t switch roles in the relationship. You can’t 
become the therapist without destroying or risking destroying your 
original relationship.  It’s a boundary you can’t cross as a therapist.  
I hope you realize that, especially therapists.  You can do simple 
things like stop smoking with your family and with friends, but how 
strange would it be because your mother came to you or your 
father came to you because they were abused as a child, right?  You 
hear that and you have that weirdness as now part of the 
relationship.  They know that they know and that you know.  I’m 
not saying that you can’t do it, but it gets so convoluted that as a 
rule, families don’t go to that level.   
 
When we talk about hypnotic gifts, we’re not talking about doing 
therapy.  We’re not talking about relieving specific issues 
straightaway.  If those issues disappear on their own, that’s great.  
We can set conditions up so that happens, spontaneously, shall we 
say.   But you can’t leave the relationship within your family like say 
a parent/child or whatever, without risking destroying it.  Does that 
make sense to you guys?   
 
And the reason that I say this because the temptation will be to go 
out there and save the world. That’s not your job.  Let the world 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
269 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
save itself.  You can help it out by giving it gifts, by empowering it to 
live a better life, to get more out of that life, to be more of 
themselves than they were before.   
 
Anthony: 
You’ll be a more rounded hypnotist.  The temptation sometimes is 
that you’re out doing street hypnosis and someone will just say, 
“Can you make me stop bingeing on biscuits?”  You’re feeling 
mighty and powerful and you just hypnotized someone a moment 
ago and she’s done all sorts of things so you think, “Well, yes, I can.  
Close your eyes.  You hate biscuits.  You’re disgusted by biscuits.  
You even try to eat a biscuit, you’ll be sick.  Eyes open.”  That will 
probably be effective.  She will probably not be able to eat biscuits.  
Is that good therapy?  No.  It is unlikely to be good therapy. It’s 
unlikely to last long term for a start.  But worse, if it does last, then 
whatever was driving her biscuit eating behavior –I say her, it could 
be a him – 
 
Igor: 
I like biscuits. 
 
Anthony: 
Whatever that was satisfying if – whatever your therapeutic model 
is – mine is that assumption behind a behavior there is some 
intention – is not going to be taken care of.  All you have done is a 
psychological equivalent of painting their fingers with something 
that tastes foul to stop them biting their nails.  How many people 
do you know who stop biting their nails because their fingers taste 
disgusting?  Nobody. Because at some point you bite your way 
through it or the same problem pops out elsewhere or whatever.   
 
So you’re not -- I just want to add to what Igor has already said, I’m 
into these gifts, random acts of kindness, almost uninvited therapy, 
right? But this is not therapy in the sense that I’m doing it in the 
room.  I will always resist those things – just I know I could do that. I 
could just help you out now.    But I’m going to resist that. I’ll 
encourage the person.  I’ll say, “Look, this is likely to be a good kind 
of therapy for you.  Go and find a good therapist or I’m based 
here.”  But no, I’m not going to get into it that right now. 
 
Igor: 
Let me give you an example of why this is important beyond the 
family context that we talked about.  What if someone comes up to 
you while your doing your street hypnosis and they’re a little bit 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
270 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
overweight and let’s pick a lady just because it’s a nice stereotype 
for it, and they say, “Oh, I over eat and so on. Can you help me lose 
weight?”  And you go, “Sure.  No worries. Let’s do it.”   
 
Now, what if it turns out that you do your trance thing and “Let’s go 
to the part of your mind that can make you be slim and trim and 
suddenly out comes a ‘BRRAUGGH’.  They were abused.  They were 
raped or something like that.  Now comfort food is putting literal a 
physical shield around them to make them less attractive, so they 
don’t get the same attention that they were afraid of.  Do you see 
how that could work?  I’m not all saying that all overeaters are like 
that.  It’s actually not as uncommon as people might think.   
 
So, is the middle of Leicester Square, the middle of the High Street 
out there, with a hundred drunk football fans and a couple of tipsy 
teenagers, “OOh, I’m 18, honestly I am,” is that the appropriate 
venue for someone to unburden something like that?  No.  So, the 
gifts that you give people should be safe gifts.  Gifts that don’t have 
to open up Pandora’s Box.  The place is open Pandora’s Box is in a 
therapy office where you have the time and the privacy and the 
context to handle those things.  Does that make sense to you guys?  
We had to mention it because what we’re about to talk about can 
look like therapy.  It can have a wonderful therapeutic effect, but it 
is not therapy.  Do you get the distinction we are coming across 
with this? 
 
Anthony: 
It’s making people feel good.  It’s showing them that they’ve got a 
powerful mind.  It’s showing them that they there is more to them 
than they imaged there was five minutes ago.  It’s giving them 
ability to return to this state any time it’s safe and appropriate.  It’s 
allowing them, in a very short period of time, to enjoy an amazing 
memory that they haven’t thought of for years.  It’s giving them a 
gift of a good feeling or a connection, bond with someone.  To be 
honest, that is about the realm of gifts that I’m in.  And 
predominately the gift that I’m going to give someone is the ability 
to go into hypnosis when I’m not there and the ability to laugh at 
something.  Exactly what I did with Michael, I don’t even know what 
it is. I know if he can remember, if he can think about that thing, I 
know what’s going to happen, it’s already starting to happen 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

because he has no choice about that anymore. He can try to take it 
seriously but you just end up drifting up above it. 
 
Audience Member: Yeah, right. 
 
Anthony: 
So on and so on and so on. Alright? But, the point is that that is a 
gift and its fun.  And in that context, yes, I’ve said a thing about 
something he would like to feel differently about.  But if it’s just 
laughter, if it’s just bright and laughter, for the sake of laughing, 
then good.  Do it.  If it’s giving someone an anchor, you can very 
quickly give someone an anchor.  It doesn’t have to be therapy.  
You can use it in a therapy room but this is an anchor. 
 
Igor: 
Did anyone do this technique over the last few days?  How many 
people have tried this one out?  About half the group?  If someone -
- Go back to the time before you knew about hypnosis or did any 
hypnosis, if someone just did this with you and let you know that 
every time you just do this, even if you’re standing in public, you 
could re-access that experience, would that be valuable to you?  
Would you think, “Wow, I really like this.”  If you could stand at a 
bus stop and go, “That’s good.”  Or you’re going into an important 
meeting and you’re a little bit stressed and you’ll go, “You know 
what?  I’ll be fine.”  Would that be of value to you?  Would that be a 
gift?  You might even pay money for if the right circumstance came 
up.  Would that be fair to say?  That’s a gift. 
 
You already know how to give gifts.  Now we’re just going to give 
you more ideas and methods for accessing it. Incidentally, just so 
you know, I’ve never given people this gift in this way before.  That 
was just because of the context that we were in here.  Normally, I‘ll 
just do it with a hand and give them – the last time I did this with a 
married guy with a wedding ring, and he just touched the wedding 
ring and he attached all those emotions to the wedding ring, so that 
his marriage became more profound.   
 
But again, it doesn’t matter where it is.  I’m trying to make sure you 
realize, it doesn’t have to be this.  At the time, it was more 
appropriate.  Anyone here in New York for the free seminar, you 
probably saw it, I think?  It was more appropriate. The ring was part 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
272 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
of his relationship. It added more elements into that. You could sit 
there and twiddle with it and have those feelings again.  
 
So you know if you’re a dentist, it might just be a different thing. It 
might just be how your mouth opens, might be that gift.  The point 
is don’t get locked on the technique, but more on the context that 
you can present with it.  Does that make sense?   
 
So, what we are going to do now is we want you guys to practice a 
few. We are to throw a few out at you.  You’re at the point now 
where you can just make stuff up as you go along, right?  I call this 
the heart massage because you are kind of going in and massaging 
their emotions by putting a pleasant positive feeling in there.   
 
Another one is what I call the mind massage, which is really an 
elaborate way of saying just get them to relax.  Because let’s face it, 
most people run around pretty stressed.  Right? Who likes a good 
shoulder rub?  If someone comes up and goes (rubs your shoulders) 
– “OOOh, Ahhh.” Kind of nice, right? So you know we enjoy a good 
shoulder rub because we carry a lot of our tension in our shoulder 
and upper back, so if someone gives us a shoulder rub and it feels 
good, it’s actually a physical stress relief of what we are 
experiencing.   
 
You can do the same thing with their mind, right?  The higher the 
arm goes, the more you can relax.  Or every time you touch yourself 
here, your mind can relax and empty out and you can have that 
peaceful feeling.  Every time you touch your fingertips together you 
can have little madras, hand anchors for releasing tension and 
breathe again. You can attach it to their breathing.  Take a deep 
breath in and hold it for a second.  Notice your thoughts.  When you 
breathe out, let it all drain out.  Doesn’t that feel clearer, calmer, 
smoother inside?   
 
Anthony: 
A friend of mine does a happy finger thing.  This is going to be your 
happy finger.   
 
Igor: 
Pull my finger! 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, every time those fingers touch – 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
273 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
  
Igor: 
I couldn’t resist.  Do you see how the trigger mechanism is 
irrelevant?  It is really what you do with it.  Who here can get 
someone’s mind to relax and release stress and tension?  Anyone?  
Okay, for those you who thinks that they can’t do it yet?  Maybe I 
just need to see the negative hands up.  You’re not quite sure.   
 
Okay, very simply, to relax someone’s mind, you have to get their 
attention away from what they are focusing on which is usually 
stressful, fearful thoughts onto something that’s relaxing and 
comforting.  It’s where attention goes, energy flows. Attention 
goes, energy flows there.   
 
If someone is stressed it is purely because they are thinking 
stressful thoughts. Right? It might be as simple as, “I don’t want to 
get run over by all this traffic and all the rest of it.”  They are just 
paying attention to a lot of stuff. So to switch their minds to a 
relaxing thought, what kind of thoughts are relaxing?  Anyone?   
 
Audience Member: Beach. 
 
Igor: 
A beach. Well, again you can ask them about a scene, a pleasant 
scene, rather than specifically a beach.  Some people may not like 
the beach.  That’s the only reason I’m saying it. 
 
Anthony: 
Their loved ones.   
 
Igor: 
Loved ones, right.  That’s how we did the hand thing wasn’t it?  
Think of someone you love. That was a part of this one here. 
 
Audience Member: Somewhere where they were happy or had a good experience. 
 
Igor: 
Somewhere where people were happy or had a happy experience, 
right?   
 
Audience Member: Like a physical experience of a massage. 
 
Igor: 
Like a physical experience of a massage. Anyone ever had a 
massage?  Is that kind of like, “Wow.” What happens to your mind, 
what does your feel like when you have a great massage?   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
274 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Audience Member:  It goes to sleep. 
 
Igor: 
It feels like it goes to sleep, doesn’t it?  It feels like it is spreading 
out.  There are no real thoughts going on.  Now what if you took 
that moment and you suggested it?  Your mind can feel calm.  Do 
you feel calm in a massage?  You don’t have to think any thoughts.  
Do you think any thoughts in a massage?  Your thinking and feeling 
can expand.  Isn’t that kind of what happens in a massage?  So take 
these experiences that you’ve had, those own highlights of relaxing, 
positive experiences.  And feed them back to someone. Describe 
them to someone, so they can have them too.  Do you see how that 
works?   
 
So now you can give them a heart massage.   You can give a mind 
massage.  You can also give them the gift of hypnosis.  In other 
words, a little trigger mechanism, every time you do x, you’ll have y, 
where y is this intense state of hypnosis.   
 
Anyone think they can give someone a self hypnosis suggestion 
relatively easily?  Yes?  Who thinks is might be hard to teach oneself 
hypnosis?  Anyone think it might be hard?  So why did only three 
hands go up?  Let’s try this again before.  Who thinks it’s easy to do 
self-hypnosis with people?  Yeah, you teach them how to go into 
self-hypnosis on their own. 
 
Anthony: 
Generally when people learn self-hypnosis –  
 
 
Gift 3: Self Hypnosis 
 
Igor: 
You have.  Can I make a demonstration?  Chris, can I borrow you 
because you are close?  Has anyone seen this before? Stand over 
here would you? Look at me.  Sleep.  All the way.  Deeper, deeper, 
deeper.  You’ve seen that, right?  In a moment, I’ll count to two.  On 
two, open your eyes feeling totally alert, refreshed, simply fantastic.  
Now, every time you hear me say the word sleep, you will go into a 
state as deep as this or even deeper.  You’ve all seen and done this?  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
275 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Nod your head if you understand.  Okay, one, two wide awake and 
sleep all the way.  Deeper, deeper, and deeper.    
 
Now, is he gone to a state as deep as that or even deeper?  Let’s try 
it again.  Once you’re wide-awake, and sleep.  All the way.  Deeper, 
deeper, deeper. Excellent.  You see him going deeper each time?  
What have I just done?  A trigger.  It happens to be me saying the 
word sleep and a result of going into self-hypnosis. Right? What if 
we just change a trigger? Okay. In a moment, I’ll do the same thing 
again.  I’ll count one, two only this time I’m going to ask you to take 
one finger of your left hand and squeeze it inside the fist of the 
other hand.  Go ahead.  Find the finger that wants to be squeezed.  
That’s right.  It’s an unnatural movement.  You don’t normally do it 
every day.  Every time you feel that sensation, allow yourself to 
drop into a state as deep as this or even deeper.  This is my gift to 
you.  It’s the power of self-hypnosis, on command.  Anytime you 
wish to use self-hypnosis, all you need to do is stop for a moment.   
 
Decide on what outcome that you want whether it’s more 
relaxation, clearer focus, resolving some inner conflict, or anything 
else that you wish to achieve with self-hypnosis.  Then as soon as 
you squeeze your finger like this, you will instantly drop into a state 
as deep as this or even deeper where you’re unconscious mind will 
have absolute freedom to resolve that issue to your satisfaction.   
 
Nod your head if you understand this.  I’m going to count to count 
from one to two.  On the count of two, you’ll become wide-awake.  
As soon as you’re ready, you will squeeze your finger in this way 
and you’ll return to this state just for the practice of self-hypnosis, 
just to ingrain it.  Then we’ll repeat this process only this time you’ll 
prove to yourself that your unconscious is doing something here.  
Nod your head if you understand that.  Okay.  Release your hands 
for a moment.  Once you’re wide-awake.  Okay, how is that?  Enjoy 
yourself? 
 
Audience Member: Really good, yes.   
 
Igor: 
What I want you to do now is go ahead and put yourself into self-
hypnosis with the magic finger however you want to.  Very good.   
That’s it.  Finding your own balance.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
276 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Is that self-hypnosis?  Would that be fair to say?  You’re doing 
great.  Now, the thing to realize now that every time you do this 
self-hypnosis, there is one thing that I have to add.  You’re not only 
going to give yourself, before you begin self hypnosis, the purpose 
of it, the thing that your unconscious mind will do for you,  you will 
also give yourself a time limit after which you will automatically 
release those hands and pop out of self-hypnosis.  That time limit 
doesn’t have to be long.  It could be just thirty seconds or a minute, 
if that is all the time you have.   If you want to just fall asleep at 
night, for example, it can be the entire night through.  You can do 
self-hypnosis and sleep all at the same time.  That’s pretty cool, 
isn’t it?   
 
Very good.  So go ahead and release your fingers for a moment.  As 
I count to two, you will come back out.  Next time around you will 
do those two things.  You will choose something simple in your life 
you wish to resolve, some simple thing that self hypnosis will help 
you with and a time limit.  Right now just take twenty seconds to 
prove to you that you can do things so quickly.  Nod your head if 
you understand.  One, two, wide-awake.  Very good.  Just think of 
something that you’d like to resolve.  Something simple.  You got it?   
 
Audience Member:  Yep. 
 
Igor: 
Give yourself twenty seconds and you know what to do.  One one 
thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand, four one 
thousand, five one thousand, six one thousand, seven one 
thousand, eight one thousand, nine one thousand, ten one 
thousand, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one – 
Ahhh. Give him a nice round of applause.  Thank you very much. 
Good job.  
 
You guys have done all this already.  There’s nothing new in the 
mechanics, is there? There’s nothing new in any of the mechanics 
and the gifts that we’re going to do today.  It’s just expanding your 
thinking of how you can put these building blocks together in a 
different way. Right? Now that you’ve seen this, is that easy to do?  
Will that be fair?  You’ve done the re-induction thing before, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
277 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
haven’t you?  You just describe to him the process in a logical 
manner.   
 
What we’re going to do now is take fifteen minutes with a partner 
and I want you to give them three gifts in a row.  Three different 
trances, three different gifts, a heart massage, a mind massage, and 
the gift of self-hypnosis.  It really only takes a few minutes to install, 
like you’ve seen.  And it’s a lot of fun and very simple.  And you can 
treat each one as a little fractionation process as you go along.  
 
Would you like to have a simple procedure for giving gifts?  Would 
that be useful to you guys? Okay. You do exactly the same thing 
that you did before.  Sleep.  Come back.  Sleep.  Come back.  Sleep.  
Time for the gift.  Come back. “Did you enjoy that?” “That was 
awesome.” Okay, sleep.  Come back.  Another gift, mind massage, 
sleep.  Fantastic.  Okay, next one.  Sleep.  Easy?  Simple to do?   
 
Audience Member: Can you expand a bit on the heart massage? 
 
Igor: 
The heart massage is very simple.  You’re going to basically get all of 
their attention focus on a pleasant experience, usually something 
around love, about emotions and so on.  So you recall when the 
hand was on here, I’d like you think about a person that you love, 
really love or are connected to. Right? Or an event that will make 
you feel particularly confident.  What you’re doing is taking an 
emotional experience, you’re technically, what’s known as 
revivifying it. Your putting so much attention into it it comes back to 
life.  They feel it from head to toes.  When they are glowing with it, 
then what I like to do is give them a trigger for it, in this case it is 
the hand here. It could be a ring finger. It could be just the same 
thing. Choose different triggers for different experiences.  You have 
five fingers in each hand, that’s one gift, gift two, gift three, gift 
four, gift five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten --  Anyone missing any 
fingers? No, that means you got at least ten gifts waiting to happen.  
Then you can start combining them in weird jujitsu movements and 
so on.   
 
Anthony: 
One other little point on this, especially if you are going to be doing 
this heart massage. Okay, when Igor first demonstrated this it was 
very much in the beginning yesterday, we were all about challenges 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
278 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
and sticking it and getting our emotions involved and tucking it up 
so they didn’t release their hand, the fact is that now we are getting 
a bit more cooperative.  And you can, if you want to test it and give 
them that convincer, still stick it, but my opinion there’s just no 
need to now. The fact is -- “And when you’re feeling that, nod your 
head so I understand,” will do it. And their feeling it and verified it 
for you, that is good enough for me.  I’d still make it stronger and 
more intense and clarify it but you don’t have to remember stick it.    
 
Igor: 
Remember for street hypnosis, gifts come at the end of your demo.  
So they have already succeeded at all these different things and so 
on. So now it’s just like, it’s literally a gift, thank you for working 
with me.  Here’s a gift. Right? You can give a gift of money and go 
here’s some money, thank you very much. It looks odd on the 
street and besides it makes you a little bit poorer. I don’t like that 
sort of version. I’ll give a gift that keeps on giving.  So, are they 
going to reject it?   They could do. But they’d be foolish too.  Does 
that make sense?  I think enough from us doing talking.  I think it is 
time for you to start playing with it. Go ahead, you’re on. Let me 
give you this, so that everyone can hear you clearly as well.   
 
Audience Member: Do we give all three gifts in a row or just one, wake him up, second, 
wake him up?   
 
Igor: 
Technically speaking, you can do whatever the hell you want.  
Honestly, this is hypnosis. 
 
Audience Member: As the exercise now? 
 
Igor: 
If you suggest it it will happen. I think in terms of your skill set, in 
terms of what you’re practicing along the lines with it, I say do 
three separate trances, one for each gift.  That way you get used to 
the other mechanics of hypnosis as well.  You just double up your 
efforts that way.   
 
Audience Member:  Thank you. 
 
Igor: 
But really, you can do it – You’re the hypnotist.  And if it doesn’t 
work out, you can always switch something around.  Okay, so you 
all understand the exercise.  It’s three simple gifts; it’s the heart

massage, mind massage, and the self-hypnosis.  Then we’ll come 
back here and do a couple more elaborate gifts, which will lead us 
towards more covert conversational street hypnosis, which we’ll be 
doing tomorrow.  Make sense you guys?  Off you go just spend 15 
minutes apiece, half hour total. 
 
 
Gifts: Insider Secrets 
 
Igor: 
Alright. So folks, how did you enjoy that?  Good stuff? 
 
Anthony: 
A few different people asked me different questions based on what 
you just did and some other ides, so I’ll give you my thoughts.  
When I do a kind of instant self-hypnosis suggestion, as I said to one 
or two of you, I’m consistent with how I do it.  That’s simply 
because I give the suggestion to so many people.  I give it to every 
therapy client unless I think they’ve got no chance of ever using it 
or being skilled in it.  I very often get into this mode when I’ve had 
some fun with street hypnosis and I’m putting them back in literally 
to do a proper wake up. Kevin will tell you because it bores the hell 
out of him some times. I end up just 5 minutes in their ear, 
essentially giving them the feel good stuff and the post hypnotic 
suggestion, for instance, the self hypnosis and then I’ll test it 
because I want them to use it. So the consistency means that if I 
ever see that person again, I will use it as a re-induction method, 
even though it’s a self-hypnotic trigger for them now.  I’ll use it as 
my method of re-induction.  So I know I don’t have to think of 
whether it’s “banana” or “relax,” I can’t remember, it is always the 
same.  If you pick one and you like it, it’s a bit like inductions you 
like, just stick with it.  I’ll quickly demonstrate.  Michael, can you 
place your feet on the floor and place your hands on your lap nice 
and light and relaxed.  Are you hypnotized now?   
 
Audience Member: No. 
 
Anthony: 
That’s a fair question.  He turns around, are you? I don’t think so 
either. So what I’d like you to do is look at the back of your right 
hand there.  Just look at one spot on your hand. Okay? In a 
moment, you’re going to go into hypnosis with your eyes open.  It’s 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
280 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
going to be a very different experience for you.  When you’re ready 
and only when you’re ready to do this, what I want you to do in 
your mind – you don’t have to speak out loud – is just repeat the 
word relax four times.  The fourth time you repeat that word you 
are going to go into hypnosis with your eyes open.  You’re going to 
know you’re in it because that hand is going to start to lift up off 
your leg all by itself.  Again don’t go deeply into hypnosis until you 
hear that word for the fourth time. Again, it will take a few 
moments.   
 
You might be wondering, “Am I really hypnotized just by repeating 
a word in my mind?”  I can assure you, you are.  Your unconscious 
can demonstrate that.  Again, you can feel it start to go.  Again, I 
know it strange feeling, it’s a weird feeling.  But you can test it.  You 
can try and keep it still and find you cannot.  It's going to get lighter 
and lighter.  You can put some effort into it.  You’re a strong guy.  
But you’ll find the harder you try consciously to keep your hands 
still the higher it is going to go.  Now, this is the gift of instant self-
hypnosis.  It will be there forever more.  And you’ll be able to use it 
anytime it is safe and appropriate for you to use it.  I’m going to 
give you a couple of simple rules that you will remember.   
 
Should you ever do this for a particular purpose or a particular goal, 
you’ll remember to phrase the outcome in the positive.  In other 
words, you will tell your mind in that little voice of yours what you 
want and when.   You will tell it how you will feel and when.  Tell it 
what you want rather that what you don’t, how you will feel rather 
that how you won’t. You will use positive language and you will put 
a time on when you want to achieve that goal.  Should you do this 
just for the purposes of using this technique for seconds or minutes, 
you will set a time limit for how long you will spend in trance, 
understanding that at any point you can bring yourself back up to 
full and conscience, wakeful alertness, simply by counting to one to 
five in your head.  It will be just like I’ve done a full wake up. One to 
five, you’ll be relaxed, refreshed, alert feeling wonderful. Just count 
in your mind when you are ready.  Of course then, your hand will 
drift back down and you drift back up feeling fantastic.  Excellent.   
 
Now, as I said, another place I’ll do this in is therapy.  People come 
around, they come to get rid of their phobia and they’ll come 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
281 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
around and you have done your work and they say, “Ahh, jeez, 
that’s was so relaxing.  I wish I could relax like that.  I really have 
trouble getting to sleep at night.”  “Tell you what, do me a favor?  
Can you put your feet on the floor?  Just place your hands on your 
lap.  Look at back of your hand for me.  You’re not hypnotized are 
you?”  No.   
 
Obviously I’m still giving suggestions, but I’m doing the minimum 
that I think I need to do.  If I have to give that hand a bit of 
encouragement verbally, then I will.  But, again, you can do it with 
your eyes open, you can do it with the eyes closed, whatever you 
think.  For some people it is a more powerful experience to see that 
happening with their eyes open.  Either way, you can set it once.  
You can test it, or you can leave parked as your re-induction cue 
later on.  Other question I want to answer, hopefully more briefly, is 
regards to this gift of when you squeeze your finger, your thumb 
and finger, whatever else it’s going to be, you’re going to feel like 
this.  
 
Igor also laid down a couple of rules there about time limits.  Those 
rules are the classic rules that you know you should set if you’re 
doing self-hypnosis.  If you’re setting an anchor, then there are 
certain rules that you want in place.  Now we were just discussing 
this in the back and we seem to kind of agree on it.  My preference 
has always been rather than doing a formal anchoring process, to 
going from a conversation waking state to getting into state, firing 
the anchor, repeating it, coming out, repeating it, it works great, it’s 
an amazingly powerful tool, my preference has always been a bit 
like a how I teach people self-hypnosis.   
 
Just box them in and give them a trigger.  It’s really, really simple.  
It’s a much quicker way that learning self-hypnosis.  A much quicker 
way of learning anchoring is have someone hypnotize you and they 
give you that anchor or trigger as a post-hypnotic suggestion.  It’s 
quicker and it’s more reliable and you can ramp it up much, much 
easier.   
 
The question was if I’m using that technique to get someone in and 
out, confident, exuberant, outward focused state, do I really want 
them down here?  And if you were doing this without formal 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
282 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
hypnosis, just doing anchoring, you’ll know how to do that, you’ll 
know that a unique physiology, how you’d stand, how you’d breath 
when you’re confident, shoulders back, chest expansive, mind 
open, voice box – you know all this stuff is important because it’s 
the unique physiology for confidence.   
 
Igor’s point was that he didn’t really care how they were sitting as 
long as they are feeling confident.  I know you can have an 
overwhelming feeling of confidence when you’re down here in a 
hypnotized state and you can tell yourself to bring it back.  The 
reason that I know that is years ago I was giving someone an 
aversion.  Normally, when I do an aversion, I want them on the 
point of puking, basically that’s the place I want them to be.  
Obviously, you won’t actually be sick.  But I want to see, I want to 
know that my suggestions are landing.  This guy was stony face.  
Didn’t move.  Didn’t whimper.  Brought him out.  “Ugh, that was 
the most disgusting experience I’ve ever had.” So I’ve been 
hammering away at this aversion and thinking I really need to work 
this. He was experiencing it all inside.  It just wasn’t being 
expressed.   
 
So I agree.  It’s no different.  You can anchor confidence in this 
state.  Later on, will they be sitting like that when they do it?  
Probably not.  They’ll just be sitting up. Will they be thinking I got to 
get up on stage in a moment; I got to give a speech? I’ll do it. That’s 
how an anchor works for me.  At worst, it brings you to the base 
line neutral.  It doesn’t mean you cartwheel on stage, it means, I 
can do it. And you find yourself walking off stage having done it. 
You didn’t go up driving on overbearing confidence.  It was just, “Of 
course I can do it. I’m going to do it.”   
 
So I don’t think that it is anything to get hung up on.  For a couple of 
the guys that asked, I said trust your instinct. If you think an up 
time, confident, powerful, outgoing anchors need that typical 
physiology, then slap them into that physiology pretty quick.  
Because with hypnosis, understand you can ask them to move. Just 
like earlier on on the street, here comes the dust cart, open your 
eyes, take three steps to your right, close your eyes, sleep. Just 
move them. You can do it with their eyes closed, just tell them to

283 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
move.  So it’s just a couple of points, this is the post hypnotic 
suggestion that is the equivalent of an anchor.   
 
The point that Igor and I agree on is that traditional anchoring is 
actually covert hypnosis with a post hypnotic suggestion tagged on.  
Could you change this state and you give some unique suggestions 
and that kind of stuff?  Either way, it’s going to work. 
 
Igor: 
We are of exactly the same mind on this.  The key thing here is was 
the post hypnotic suggestion a clear instruction, when X then Y. 
That’s the mathematically formula going on inside their brain. If 
they don’t have a clear X, whether it’s this or it’s this, it gets 
confusing and the anchor falls apart and what not.  If you have it 
clear, it doesn’t matter where they begin.  The fact that they are 
doing this may well end up doing “Whaa, this is great.” It’ll take 
them to wherever they need to go because you’ve suggested it.  
That’s the point.  There’s no mystical energy field thing going on.  
It’s the pure suggestion.  If he accepts it, the mind will do 
everything it needs to put them there.  If they don’t, well then, you 
need to do your hypnotic work a little bit better.   
 
Anthony: 
A nice little bit of evidence to back that up is that classical 
conditioning, Pavlov, does not take two or three repetitions.  Yes, 
you can have a traumatic experience and you can fuse a phobic 
response, you can have one trial learning.  I don’t doubt that.   
 
Igor: 
That’s a hypnotic experience.   
 
Anthony: 
Exactly.  Generally that conditioned response – you’ve all trained a 
cat or a dog or a child at some point – it takes a long period of time.  
Why in anchoring should it happen in three goes?  Well, my opinion 
it goes back to what I said about hypnosis generally.  It’s because 
you’re throwing a whole load of emotion into it.  In that state, the 
person is more receptive to the ideas that are being presented.  
And if you know how to use your language, you’ll present that idea 
in a crystal clear, straight ahead fashion, which is, if you do X, Y is 
going to happen. And you can repeat it and drill it in.   
 
Igor: 
If you ever watch a good demonstration of anchoring and you know 
anything about hypnosis, I defy you to not find the hypnotic 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
284 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
context.  It’s obvious. Often the person is like this. There is virtually 
no thoughts going on inside their head.  They’re nodding constantly 
and so on.  They’re in that state already.  It just happens to be 
activated conversationally, which is essentially for those you who 
are interested, that’s what we are going to do tomorrow.  The times 
that anchoring hasn’t worked, I don’t know if you guys have seen 
bad demos, I’ve seen a few god awful ones, is when on the surface 
everything is right, the unique posture, you might even have a clear 
state, but the person is thinking, “Will this work here? Will this work 
there? What is going on?”  You can see that interfering filter so 
when the anchor comes in, there is too much interference. The 
mind won’t accept it because there is not a condition there for the 
hypnotic suggestion to work.   
 
Now you may disagree with us or agree with us.  Honestly, I don’t 
care.  It’s your choice.  What we want to present to you here is the 
idea that what most people think is anchoring and all the strange 
mystique that is being built up around it, consider that just as a 
covert form of inducing a post-hypnotic suggestion.  If you do it that 
way, it’s work that can be a treat whether it is in a conversation or a 
more formal trance.  It’s pretty much worked every time and if it 
hasn’t worked, I’ve known exactly why.  When I fill in with too many 
terms, it just gets very confusing.  That’s just my personal opinion.  
You’re welcome to it or not.  It’s up to you.   
 
Anthony: 
Just like the street hypnosis, the very fiery, in your face quick rapid 
stuff is now starting to slide into this gift stuff.  It’s actually the 
same techniques.  It’s going to be exactly the same.  A lot of these 
gift techniques and approaches are the entering wedge for a covert 
approach.  It’s not placed on complex psychobabble. Yes, use your 
language.  Master your language.  Ultimately you’ve only got words 
to do this job.  All of these things do not to be presented as a 
hypnotist, with hypnosis, eyes open, eyes shut.  It doesn’t matter.  
It’s just a good feeling.  It is something that you learn once from or 
you’ve ever heard of.   
 
So tomorrow we’re going to open this up.  To me, it’s taking it back 
to where it began, that is its story telling roots.  That’s what you do.  
It doesn’t mean that you have to waffle on in metaphor for half an 
hour to tell a story.

Igor: 
You can tell it in five minutes and you’ll have exactly the same 
impact.  You’re looking for the same points.  We’ll get into that 
tomorrow anyway.   
 
What I want to do today now is – did you enjoy the gifts that you’ve 
been giving each other?  Was that a valuable thing to do for each 
other?  Did you like that?  Is that the kind of thing that you want to 
take home and do with your friends and your family?  Does that 
seem like an appropriate thing to do?  It’s not invasive.  It’s a gift.  
You give someone flowers.  You give them a book because you 
think they’ll enjoy it.  This is the same thing.  I’d like to give you a 
couple of more gifts.   
 
 
Hypnosis & Pain 
 
Igor: 
The first one of which is, the hypnotist must feel relatively 
contentious so I want to put that in a little pre-frame.  It belonged 
to a certain place and actually this is something you will hopefully 
very rarely use.  I’ll explain why.  We’re talking about pain control.  
Now, pain control itself, I could spend a week, three days, five days, 
just talking about all the parameters with big pains and major sort 
of chronic stuff, we don’t want to get into that element at all.  We 
want to have a quick fix if it’s a headache or an injury or something 
like that.  But I want to put some very careful conditions around 
this.  This is why I say that you’ll almost never use it.  It’s more like 
an emergency tool you’ll pull out, if you really have to.  Here’s why.  
Why do people have pain? 
 
Audience Member: Because something is wrong. 
 
Igor: 
Because something is wrong! Right? Something’s wrong and it’s the 
body’s way of getting your attention for that thing.  So the first rule 
of pain is you can have anything you want to the extent that you 
pay attention.  If you don’t pay attention, you’ll pay with pain.  Pain 
is a signal from the body saying that you’ve ignored this long 
enough.  That’s it.  I’m not going to let you ignore it anymore, right, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
286 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
whether it is a tension headache or something more serious, etc.  
Now what could be the problem about taking pain away now?   
 
Audience Member: The underlying problem is still there. 
 
Igor: 
The problem is still there.  Let me give you an example of this.  Let’s 
say I slip a disc, slip a couple of discs, right, huge pain in my back.  I 
go, “Hey, I’m a hypnotist. Pain gone. Alrighty.”  I can now walk. I can 
now run. I can now do my marathon.  What’s going to happen to 
that disc?  It’s going to erode, it’s going to erode and eventually it’s 
going to pop.  It’s going to destroy itself.  What’s going to happen to 
my back and my nerves inside my back?  Chances are? 
 
Audience Member: The pain will be back. 
 
Igor: 
On some level, yes.  More importantly, are you risking sitting in a 
wheel chair for the rest of my life just because I thought it was 
more important to run that race?  Does that make sense to you 
guys?  So I’m very, very, very cautious about working with any kind 
of pain.  Because it’s a signal that something is wrong.  Now you 
might think it’s only a headache.  I’ll take a few tablets.  Now people 
taking tablets is self-medication.  I actually don’t like it.   I think it’s a 
really bad habit that is being promoted by TV.  I think it’s an 
unethical habit.  Because what if that headache is a signal that let’s 
say, someone has a brain tumor and it’s pushing on the brain so 
that’s what they have headaches from? “Oh, I’ll pop a couple more 
tabs, a couple more tabs, couple more tabs. Right? Are they taking 
care of -- the body is warning them.  You’ve a chance to do 
something about this, but they’re not.   
 
What if you take it away with hypnosis?  It is the same.  Is it 
healthier than taking a pill?  Sure it is.  But it’s the same thing.  The 
only difference is now you’re at fault.  The drug manufacturer may 
have managed to create this great hypnotic framework where, 
“We’re not at fault. It’s legal. Look, the FDA says we’re allowed to 
do this.  You took it at your own risk.” Right? And to some extent, 
they are right.  People make their own decisions.  But if you 
hypnotize pain away, it’s your responsibility, which is why when we 
go into this holiday of pain control.  I want to put this in the context 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
287 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
of saying that you’ll hopefully very rarely use it.  Here are the kind 
of times I’m thinking of when it is appropriate to use it.   
 
I was out at a dinner with a friend of mine.  He’s a medical doctor, 
had a toothache.  He is a medical doctor, he was already diagnosed.  
He knows exactly what is wrong.  I made sure he’s already got the 
appointment to go to the dentist.  It was two days away.  It was the 
weekend and Monday morning he was going to go.  On top of that, 
he was taking every medication under that sun for it, which is not 
really healthy for him, but he’s a doctor, he can prescribe himself 
stuff.  It’s not a big deal for him.  In that context, I pushed every 
parameter, are you seeing a – do you know what it is? Yes. Have 
you seen a dentist?  Yes. Are you getting it fixed? Yes, on Monday. 
Really there was nothing left.  All it’s got left right now is two days 
of suffering before it happens. Right? In that context, I was almost 
happy to take the pain away.  Why almost? 
 
Audience Member: Something could still happen. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly, for two days he’s still got that pain. What if he starts eating 
whatever he wants? I’m going to crunch on nuts and all the rest of 
it because I don’t feel pain. He’s going to make it worse.  Here is 
something very interesting that happened.  This is when we were 
doing the pain control method.  We took the pain away.  Then he 
ordered a really hot spicy dish.  And funny, the pain came back.  
Why is that? Right? I said, “You idiot.  What in the hell you going to 
do that for?”  You just gone and violated the agreement you have 
with your unconscious which is to the extent you take the pain 
away; I’ll take care of this until you get specialist help. That’s the 
agreement that you are making with your unconscious.  I’m 
listening.  I’m going to take responsibility for the pain and make 
sure that it is looked after as best as possible.   
 
Once the conditions are right for it to be treated, it will be handled.  
So there’s really no need for the pain anymore is here?  He violated 
the terms of the agreement.  No wonder the pain came back.  He 
asked for it to go away again.  I said, “Nope. I’m not doing that.”  He 
wheeled a bit so I said all right here’s what I’ll do.  We’ll change the 
contract a little bit.  This time we’ll take the pain away again, just as 
we did before, no worries at all. In fact it was easier the second 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
288 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
time because he already had that loop inside his mind. Only this 
time the deal is this, to the extent that you take care of that tooth, 
you take care of the health in the mouth and make sure you go to 
the dentist and look after it, you really don’t need the pain 
anymore.  It can disappear or it can go down to like a tiny little buzz 
just to remind you something is still there. Now to the extent that 
you could do anything that could possibly violate the integrity of 
that tooth, that pain is not only going to come back, it’s going to 
come back double and triple and four times, five times, each time 
you violate it, it will get even stronger that before.   
 
He said, “I don’t think I like that.”  “Good.  That’s the deal I’m giving 
you.  I’m not doing it any other way.” Because I’m not going to put 
him in a position where he could do himself more damage than if I 
had insisted.  Does that make sense to you guys?   
 
Same thing with a headache.  I don’t take headaches away. 
Sometimes I like taking headaches away and people take and pop 
some pills and kind of think, I can do this. But I don’t. Why? Because 
that’s me taking responsibility for their life.  They have to.  If 
they’ve gone to a doctor, if they’ve gone and got themselves 
medically checked out, if they’re on the all clear, if everything that 
can happen has been done, sure, I’ll take the headache away.  
Those conditions are very rarely fulfilled.    
 
One of the last seminars in Vegas, before we did a mentoring 
program, a stage hypnosis in fact, there is a great guy there, Jimmy 
Dicks, some you may have seen his testimonial on the Internet.   
 
He had chronic back pain for six years, I think.  He had an industrial 
accident.  Really bad.  His back was really messed up, chronic pain 
to the point to where he drank himself to sleep at night, I mean, 
serious stuff.  And for the four days of the stage hypnosis course, he 
said, “Look, can you take the pain away. Please, I just come here 
just hoping you’d take the pain away.”  I said, “I’m sorry.  I can’t do 
it.  Do you have a doctor’s certificate?  Have you talked to your 
doctor?”  He said yes and he was trying to get me certificate and so 
on.  “Great.  Once you have that, then we can do something.”

And as it turned out, he came onto the mentoring program 
afterward as well.  I think it was the third day of the mentoring 
program or something like that, wasn’t it. We did the pain control. 
You were there. 
 
Audience Member:  Yeah, it was about that. 
 
Igor:  
On the third day of the mentoring program, the doctor’s note 
actually came in. It said, “Yep, they knew what was going on.  There 
was nothing to be done right now. Yep, it’s safe for pain to be taken 
away.  The doctor has now given absolute sign off on this.  Because 
it was basically drugs, alcohol, or hypnosis. Right? I knew which of 
those three I would choose.   
 
Then, I wasn’t really that long.  It was ten minutes, fifteen minutes 
to do the whole thing.   
 
Audience Member:  Yeah, it was pretty quick. 
 
Igor:  
So that was because we already hypnotic context set up from 
several days of doing stuff as well. That’s a different story. But 
hopefully I have impressed upon you now that when you are 
dealing with pain, it’s great tool to have in your kit, but it’s not a 
tool you will pulling out very often.  Does that make sense to you 
guys? You know, a kid falls over and skins his knee?  Sure take the 
pain away.  You know what that is. Right? They fall over badly, be 
more careful.  Because that pain that might be, let’s check that out 
more carefully, it might be a fracture. It might need to be x-rayed 
and so on.  
 
We want to be very careful when we do these things.  Do you 
accept that as the contract between working with pain and so on?  
It’s a tool kit.  The reason why I like to put it into the street hypnosis 
element is because for me street hypnosis is beyond the 
entertainment field. We are now talking about a gift. It’s a tool for 
life.  There will come a point in your lives when it is an appropriate 
tool to pull out and help someone.   
 
A friend of mine, he studies wolves, was out in Slovenia or Slovakia; 
I can’t quite remember which, out in the mountains studying the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
290 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
wolves there.  He just threw his back out. He had a weak back 
anyhow and he just threw it out.  He’s in six feet of snow. Right? He 
cannot get back. As it turns out, his friend ended up carrying him 
out and it was a long journey.  In that case though, if it’s a question 
of you freeze to death here, or we take care of the pain and you just 
pay the price later, sure it is worth doing it there.   
 
You turn up at an accident and someone is in agony.  Again, you can 
take away the pain, but you don’t take it away for good.  You only 
take it away until medical attention is there.  And then you make a 
provision in there, along the lines of, that when a doctor asks you, 
you’ll be able to give absolute accurate answers in terms of the 
levels and sensations of pain and so on.  It will return for the level 
of interview, then you have the option of removing it again 
afterwards. Why?  Because the doctor needs that for diagnosis.  
Does that make sense?   
 
You see how we have to proceed very carefully when we deal with 
this stuff.  Is it okay that we put that framework around this stuff?   
It’s a tool that you will have.  I will tell you how to do it.  We 
probably won’t really get a chance to practice it because it is really 
not appropriate for doing here.  Should the situation already arise, 
it fits within the toolkit that you already had.  You’ll have it there, 
but hopefully you’ll never use it. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s the kind of thing that you should be able to make happen and 
those moments will pop up.  I will quickly, before he gives you this 
technique, spin through a couple of moments my father’s had.   
Doing a mass group quit smoking session, one lady brought her 
husband just to sit in.  He had a raging toothache, terrible, terrible 
toothache.  Three or four minute technique my dad looked over, 
the guy said, “Where’s the pain gone now? Do I still need to go to 
the dentist?” That was his question. Do I still need to go to the 
dentist?  “Yes, of course you need to go to the dentist.” You know it 
would be nice to go in there free of the pain, wouldn’t it?  
 
He had another moment and this -- If you have ever bothered to 
watch some of the evangelists on TV, if you want to be a hypnotist, 
I suggest that you do, particularly Benny Hinn.  Right? If you want to 
see a hypnotist in action check out Benny Hinn, he’ll blow your 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

mind.  You might detest what he does, which is walk out with large 
suitcases full of people’s cash at the end of the night.  He is an 
amazing hypnotist.   
 
Now my dad has had many moments like this, where he is doing a 
session and someone at the end says, “You know what, I couldn’t 
really get into it.  I suffer with chronic pain.  I’ve got spondylosis of 
the spine and I’ve got crumbling hips, I’ve been on crutches for 
eleven years. Can you do anything about pain?”  Now my dad is one 
of those people who is a force for good.  He cannot resist doing 
that.  He doesn’t bother to say, come and see me at my schedule; 
he’s hanging around at the end. POP. He’s got a little technique, it 
literally takes a minute or two.  And there’s a double bind on the 
end of it.  That arm is going to drift down only as quickly as you drift 
up completely free of that pain.  
 
He did it with two women at the same time. Boom. First one, burst 
into tears.  Second one, crying. “Are you okay?”  “Yeah, it’s the first 
time in eleven years that I haven’t felt any pain.  Do you think that I 
can walk without my crutches?”  “I’m not a doctor.”  She’s says, 
“Hold these. I’ve got an MRI scan on Monday, do you think I should 
go?”  “Yes, I do.  I’m not a doctor.”  But it would be nice to walk in 
without your crutches, wouldn’t it. She grabbed the kid’s hand. She 
walks out of the room, not on her crutches, but hand in hand with 
her kid.  It’s the first time that she’s done that because she’s been 
on crutches for eleven years and he was four or five. 
 
Now we’re going to talk about and it’s going to sound like another 
little feel good gift, a little rush of oh yes, love that person. But 
what you have to understand is pain is a point of view.  I know it’s 
hard to take if you’re in chronic pain.  But it is not just the majority 
of it, the entirely of that experience is related to the way that 
you’ve been amplifying it and focusing on it. Okay? The brilliant 
little book on pain control by the human givens people I’ve been 
banging on about.  He talks about the nervous system, and how is a 
fast track, which will give you the pain. There is a slower track that 
is the amplifier that is driven by attention.  If you’re like, I’m going 
to miss the rest of football season or I’m not going to be able to 
write for the next week, then it’s going to flare up.

Igor:  
 
Where attention goes, energy flows. 
  
Anthony: 
Yes. The reason that mother’s touch or you will be alright, come on 
you can let go of it, the reason that works is because there is 
another track that runs in the other direction.  This is the track that 
your body uses when that wound is half healed.  It knows it doesn’t 
have to continue throwing white blood cells at it in the same way.  
It needs the other track.  So the soothing words, the calming touch 
is essentially turning down that amplifier.  You can achieve 
ridiculous evangelical style changes with pain control.  That is 
where the danger lies.  Igor has made that pretty plain.  Let’s get on 
with the techniques. 
 
Audience Member: Question.  If there’s pain and there is an underlying physical 
condition behind it, if you plant the suggestion that the pain goes 
away, that’s one thing.  But can’t you somehow plant the 
suggestion regarding the physical condition underlying it, so that 
there is a physical changing going on? 
 
Anthony: 
You can, but this isn’t a therapy course.  You can do a therapy 
course. Learn some full pain control techniques. Of course, you can 
100%. 
 
Igor: 
There is a lot of stuff you can do to promote physical healing.  You 
can’t make someone heal physically, especially as a hypnotist.  
There are a lot of things you can do, increase the white blood cell 
counts, immune system control, some amazing things from skin 
changes and all those kinds of things have happened with hypnosis.  
This is not the course for that.  This is getting into more technical 
areas. But yes, there are possibilities within that.   
 
Anthony: 
I think you have one more question. 
 
Audience Member: I just wanted to ask I have a bad back for about four years and I had 
a slipped disc. Basically, I spend like two weeks where I couldn’t get 
out of bed at all.  And this is what interests me about hypnosis is, 
can you self-hypnotize yourself with the same things to take the 
pain away? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
293 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Sure.  Absolutely, except that the same exact caveat still applies.  
You have a slipped disc, which means that it is prone to damage 
because it is in the wrong position, should we say. First, do you 
have medical advice, have physiotherapeutic advice? Another 
words, once the pain is gone, assuming the pain can go away, how 
should I be moving so I limit the damage I am doing to myself?  
Does that make sense? 
 
Audience Member: Yes, generally when I got out of bed, it would take me like, if I was 
going to manage it, it would take me three hours to get out of bed.  
I could move around all day.  I’d get to teatime and I’d feel great.  
There is something that kind of wears off. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, well, with self-hypnosis you can do all of that sort of stuff.  
Again, in some respects, you experienced a form of self hypnosis by 
taking that pain away for the day.  It just came back the next day 
again.  I don’t want to get into that too much right now, but the fact 
is yes you can and the exact same caveats still apply because you 
can carry on and do yourself damage.   
 
It’s very useful to learn, I was thinking of some point doing a pain 
control, like a weekend where we’ll teach people how do that. How 
to create a mental spot on their body where they can move 
anywhere they want to instantly wipe out pain.  The thing is 
though, before I’m willing to do that I have to put those caveats in 
place because there’s one thing to do it for an emergency situation, 
you cut yourself or it’s a simple nick.  You don’t have to feel it 
anymore. You have an accident and you’re rushing to hospital.  
There is no need for the pain anymore versus “Oh, it’s gone now.  I 
can carry on my drinking binge and rolling around on the ground 
and doing all these crazy things.”   
 
If people don’t understand the flip side of what they are doing, 
they’ve you done them more harm than good by giving them that.  
Does that make sense?  Hence with self-hypnosis, I would not teach 
them self-pain control unless it is absolutely, fundamentally clear 
on what basis they are doing it.  I’ll probably slip in some 
suggestions with my friends that there’s a contract there.  We’ll talk 
about that now as we talk about that technique.

Gift 4: Pain Control 
 
Igor: 
There are millions of pain control techniques. I really don’t care 
which one you use.  For me, the important part is actually the set 
up.  You get a set up right, the rest becomes easy.  You can do your 
– I like the time you used the voodoo shaman technique or the 
voodoo witch doctor technique. You can say, “Here is my magic 
rattle, when it touches you pain is gone.”  Literally, you can do it 
that simply if you wanted to.  It’s the set up that is the important 
part.   
 
For me the set up has a couple of important phases.  The first phase 
is to reframe what the actual pain is. Right? Pain is a signal from the 
body.  It’s getting your attention.  Does it have your attention yet?  
Yes.  Great. Are you listening?  What do you mean?  Well, if you got 
a pain in the back, are you willing to stop doing whatever it is you’re 
doing that makes it worse. You mean I can’t jump on the trampoline 
anymore?  Well, is it working for you?  No, it hurts.  Well, then I 
guess that is supposed to be something that you should be 
stopping.   
 
See the first thing you’ve got them to do is get them to accept that 
relationship. Right? If they accept it, what’s happening is that you 
are taking care of a whole bunch of things at the same time.  As 
Antony mentioned, I don’t want to get into the whole pain thing 
too much, essentially only about third, maybe even less, of what 
you experience in pain is actually pain.  The rest of it is the 
emotional constructs around it.  It’s called anticipatory pain.  You 
fear that more pain will come in the future.  It’s remembered pain.   
 
You go back in the past to remember the pain you’ve had.  Those 
two thirds can be taken care of straight away.  If someone goes, 
“There, there, I’ll take care of it.” Now if they believe you, poom, 
two thirds of the pain is gone because their mind is no longer 
trapped between the past and the future.   
 
Even the present pain itself is augmented by the perception of it.  
Pain is socialized.  Sometimes I even throw this one out as well.  I 
don’t know if you know this.  There is an interesting story.  Dog 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
295 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
lovers turn away.  This is not going to be for you.  Dog is brought up 
in isolation without any other dogs to learn from.  Another dog is 
brought up in a pack.  The dog that grows up in a pack will learn 
certain things about pain.  For example he gets burned by fire, he 
whimpers and runs away.   
 
What he’s doing is that that behavior is not about himself.  It’s to let 
the pack know that something has happened to him.  Please take 
care of me or please take care or full stop. Right? So, as a side effect 
of that socializing behavior, he’ll be afraid of the fire.  He’ll cower.  
He’ll keep away from it and so on.   
 
Take the dog in isolation.  He’s never learned that behavior because 
he’s got no pack to refer to back to.  And there is actually no need 
for that behavior because there’s no one that is going to be looking 
after him anyway so there is no need to respond to pain in the 
same way.  This dog will happily sit there all day licking a boiling hot 
radiator burning his tongue because there is no reference point to 
why he shouldn’t be doing that.  Does that kind of make sense? 
 
If you look across cultures across the globe, in England, for example, 
the Gurkha is a part of the English army, renowned for their 
toughness.  They are small and wiry.  They’re not exactly big hulks.  
They are tough as hell.  Everyone in the British Army admires them.  
What most people don’t realize that the culture they have grown 
up in, what we would consider to be pain, they just consider 
sensation. Of course you get slapped around by the wind. Of course 
it’s heavy having this thing on. That’s just life.   
 
If I injure my knee and I stop walking on it, am I listening to the 
message?  Yes, partially.  If I promise to go to physio-therapy and 
get a doctor’s attention on it, I am taking everything I can do to take 
care of it.  Do I still need the pain?  Is there any purpose?  Does it 
serve any purpose anymore? No.  So if you can make a contract 
with the pain, with the body, with your unconscious mind, I like 
keeping it simple.  You stop giving me the pain.  I will take care of 
this.  I will see the right doctors.  I will stop walking on it.  I’ll see the 
physiotherapist.  I’ll do whatever it takes to make it get better.  You 
on the other hand, you let me sleep.  You let me have a day, even if 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
296 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
it’s on the crutches or the wheelchair, where I can just feel relief.  
Deal?  Good.   
 
Now you have the perfect context for pain control to occur. Right? 
To be honest with you, I make the deal with the conscious mind.  
The conscience mind is the one that says, “Do I still have to go to 
the dentist?” Or can I just start running down the road and run a 
marathon on this knee? Make sense? That’s the mind that has to 
make the connection.   
 
Now very often, just by making that contract, already I’m having 
them at a very strong hypnotic context because they are getting to 
this place – I think you saw this with Jimmy when we did this – that 
on its own can already create a massive relief.  There’s a third point 
that you need to be aware of here.  Very often that people will 
exaggerate the pain because they are telling you the pain that they 
remember, not the pain that is actually there. That’s what 
happened with Jimmy. So what’s the pain?  He’s describing this 
huge pain all over the place.  
 
Anthony: 
How’s your back? Oh, it’s really bad! Oh, I haven’t moaned about it 
for two hours. 
 
Igor: 
So then I said, "I don’t want to know what the pain is normally like. 
What I want to know is what is the sensation now.” “Oh, it’s 
actually just this small thing here.” Right?  This already tells me that 
his mind is adding pain through the projection and that sort of stuff. 
Great, at that point, actually it is really simple.  If they have 
accepted the reframe, if they have made the contract with 
conviction, another words, they have really made that contract, at 
that point almost anything will make the pain go away.  You can do 
a little clap, slap; slam in trance and when they come back it will be 
gone.   
 
Anthony: 
Even some of the things you have done already will be a perfect 
vehicle for delivering this -- 
 
Igor: 
As soon as I touch your shoulder, a comforting glow will go down 
your back until it smoothes it all away.  You can use anything you 
want really.  I have, you can do your little Reiki, Reiki hands, “And as 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
297 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
you feel the heat of my hands on the back, that pain will 
disappear.” Really the mechanism now becomes irrelevant.  There 
are hundreds of mechanisms, some very clever ones.  I don’t want 
to go into those really because they are irrelevant at this point, at 
this level we are doing.   
 
You know if someone has a headache, “Great, I’m going to take 
your headache away.  Now, you realize your headache is trying to 
get your attention about something.  Do you know what it is?” “I 
don’t know.” “Have you seen a doctor?”  “Yes.” “What has the 
doctor said?” “Oh, it’s just tension.”  “What do you mean it’s just 
tension?  Tension is an important thing.  What are you doing to 
make yourself tense?” “Oh, all this stress at work, this, that and the 
other.”  “So would it be okay if we made a deal here?  To the extent 
that you start finding ways of finding more comfort in your life and 
not stressing yourself out so much, I’ll help you take that pain away.  
Is that a deal we can make?”   
 
Notice that I’m making a contract with him that actually takes care 
of why the message is there in the first place. Right? “So, I’m going 
to do my magic hands here.  Here is the headache.  Feel the glow of 
my hands.  Feel the headache disappearing.  Now isn’t that 
soothing?  Isn’t that wonderful?  Feel it disappearing, going, going, 
going, going.  Is it all gone yet?” “Yeah.” “Wow!  That’s crazy, isn’t 
it?” Right?  There’s no magic in my hands.   
 
The magic is his understanding of what it means.  Now typically I 
will keep him to his contract now.  What I want you to do now is as 
you feel my touch coming towards your head I want your mind to 
go on a journey and find ways that you can relieve stress.   Find 
ways of being a better person, so you don’t have to have all that 
stress.  Okay, so go ahead and focus on this now.” Pow. Why? 
That’s part of the contract that person made.  Does that make 
sense to you guys?   
 
Anthony: 
One other little thing you can add into the contract – again it is very 
much an Erickson thing as far as I know – is to leave them with a 
little bit of pain.  Actually, just leave them with a portion of that 
pain. “How much could you bear?  Ten percent?  It’s 10 out of 10 
right now, if it was 2 out of 10 would you be OK?” Then they still 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
298 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
have the signal.  Your contract in a way doesn’t have to be quite as 
binding because they still have the signal, which is saying go to the 
doctor.   
 
Igor: 
It just reminds them.  That is exactly what I did my doctor friend.  
He clearly disrespected the absence of pain. So I refused to take it 
away entirely.  I wasn’t really doing it. I was refusing to suggest it 
away, I should put I that way.  I said, “Right, you are going to have a 
small level of pain to remind you to take care of this.  And it’s going 
to get very intense the minute you do something stupid.”   
 
Anthony: 
For some it just seems to be an easier suggestion to take.  Because 
the fact is that when they report that pain, when you scale it, they 
normally exaggerate it.  They can’t help it.  They don’t mean to.  
They aren’t consciously exaggerating it.  They just want to report 
how bad it was when they got out of bed this morning. 
 
Igor: 
What they are basically asking for is a bit of a pity fest.  It felt 
terrible that morning.  Now it may have receded some like we were 
talking about there, and it feels like they are over complaining, but 
really it was a terrible pain at the time.  It’s just you’re fixing it now, 
so it doesn’t have to come back again.  Do you guys feel good about 
that as an idea?  Have I emphasized the cautionary measures 
around it enough? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Can you all see yourself doing a solid piece of pain control given the 
right context? Right? It’s a very simple thing.  You make the 
contract. 
 
Anthony: 
If the answer is no, then don’t do it.  It’s fine.   
 
Igor: 
Don’t do it. You may want to get more training if you want to go 
down that road a little bit.  The steps are very simple.  Step one is 
the reframe, what pain really is.  Step two is the contract.  Can they 
accept that contract, emotionally as well as intellectually?  And 
then step three, based on all that, you really pretty much have the 
hypnotic contract at that place, you just start doing some kind of 
method to convince them that something is happening.  You can do 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
299 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
that officially – sleep, I’m going to count from five to one, with each 
number I count, the pain is going to reduce by a factor, whatever. 
Five, only 90% of the pain there. Four, down to 60%. Three, 20% 
and so on. One, all pain all gone or only 10% left, that’s the pain, 
the sensation you will take with you so that you know you’ll be 
taking care of it, yada, yada, yada.  The method is really irrelevant 
at that point.   
 
Anthony: 
It is.  It is pretty simple.  Bear in mind people have been doing by 
shaking bones at people for a very long time.   
 
Igor: 
Very successfully as well.  The mind, seriously, the mind is very, very 
powerful.  It will do this.  It is not your job to make it happen.  It’s 
your job to create the context where it will happen automatically.  
Do you understand the distinction? 
 
Anthony:  
People are often really happy to get let go of that pain.  They might 
not want to let go of their twenty cigarettes.  There’s often a 
payout for it.  The only other thing that I like to add and I always say 
this at some point on a course anyway, but it is particularly relevant 
to this.  It is what my stage hypnosis training called Svengali 
Syndrome.  It’s when you start to believe your own hype.  You start 
to believe you are an all powerful deity.  You can take away pain 
and get rid of headaches.  Of course, you can. You can do that. Just 
beware that you do this stuff and everyone’s jaws hit the floor. 
Don’t believe the hype, its public enemy. Don’t believe your own 
hype.  Recognize they are doing it. They have the resources. They 
have the imagination. You’re just the guide. You’re just facilitating.  
Taking away pain is one of those things where it does try getting 
some hooks into your ego.  You just have to watch it. 
 
Igor: 
I just want to add something if I may briefly.  Oh, go ahead -- 
 
Audience Member: That I think also is a phenomenal gift.  If you can let your ego get 
out of the way and give them the gift at the end to say, “Isn’t this 
incredible.  Here we are sitting in this crowded spot and you just 
took care of a problem you’ve had for twenty-five years.  You did it.  
I didn’t even know what the cause was.  I didn’t know what it was.  
You did everything.  You were nice enough to allow me to come 
along for the ride.  So really you have given me an incredible gift.

But you can do this anytime.  You have tapped into the power of 
your unconscious mind.  You have it very, very powerfully.”  You’re 
ego is gone. 
 
Anthony: 
Exactly. 
 
Igor: 
That is absolutely the truth of it.  That is actually the mechanism 
that’s happening. Right?  
 
Audience Member:  Works very well when it’s the truth. 
 
Igor: 
Just emphasize that, this is a very valuable lesson that I learned 
years ago actually by a very fortuitous accident.  You guys familiar 
with the show ‘Pop Idol’ in America? In America it is called 
American Idol.  You have the nasty Simon Cowell, who just poo 
pooed on people.  I don’t really watch the show much.  I remember 
one episode.  It was just on TV for whatever reason; I can’t 
remember why I watched it. It had this little kid singing his heart 
out.  That’s his thing.  And really the interview afterwards really 
interested me.  It’s something that caught my attention and it’s 
been with me.  It’s been a very healthy thing for me since then. 
Which is he had a really poor performance.   
 
This was like Simon’s favorite.  He was rooting for him all along, 
telling him that he’s an amazing kid.  You’ve got to go for it and all 
the rest of it.  Had a terrible performance, Simon ripped him a 
proverbially new one and basically said to him, look, the trouble 
with you is, you’ve been having all these successes and everyone 
has been talking about how amazing you are.  You have talent. You 
really do have talent. The problem is with all this hype and the 
things people are saying about you, the problem is you started to 
believe it.  You stopped doing those things that made you this good.  
You stopped practicing as much.  You stopped putting your heart 
and soul into it.  And if there is one percent of advice I can give you, 
it would be the same advice I would give all of you guys, is we 
create the hype, we don’t believe it, because if people start 
believing it, they lose the very thing that got them to the place 
where people actually start to believe the hype too.  Does that 
make sense?  So a little bit of humility actually helps you a huge 
amount to be a better hypnotist.

In my experience those hypnotists that I have seen that have fallen 
down the ego trap – by the way, I fall down it all the time.  
 
Anthony: 
 
Sure, sure. 
 
Igor: 
I’m a human being.  I like the attention. Right? I’m being honest 
about this.  I try and keep myself out of this, because the people I 
have seen who lock themselves into that trap, they’ve lost 
everything.  I mean, they lost their credibility.  They aren’t really 
that good anymore.  They come up with these really weird ideas 
that simply don’t work and they try and force them on people and 
so on.  You see the genius that they had and what they have 
become is like, “How could you go so wrong?  You had such 
amazing things.”  I don’t know if you have seen the same thing but 
I’ve seen it happen so often that I try and stay clear of it.   
 
Anthony: 
There are a lot of big egos in this industry.  There’s performing.  
That’s part of it.  It’s a kind of one-man show.  That’s another aspect 
of it.  But the third, I really believe, is this sense of power.  It just 
goes to some people’s heads.  They really start to believe it is them.  
Just remind yourself every now and again.  When I work with 
people – I love being hypnotized.  I’m not the greatest subject in the 
world. There’s a limited belief for you. I haven’t convinced myself 
that I’m the greatest subject just yet.  But I love it.  I love the feeling 
and I love the experiences that I can have with it.  But very often I 
envy the state my client is in or their abilities.  Not from a bitter 
kind of fashion, but it’s just like wow,  I’ve been doing this for 
fifteen, it’s longer than that now, fifteen or sixteen years.  I’m still 
blown away by it.  I’m still blown away by sessions I do in therapy 
where I have literally seen 4 and a half thousand smokers.  Do you 
get bored of that?  I don’t get bored of it and every person is an 
individual and they amaze me.   
 
When I do stuff on stage, I might have run that routine a hundred 
times, but it never quite goes in the same direction.  I’m always 
astonished by that bit of creativity that can just pop out from a 
mistake I made or something I forgot to say, or they have 
interpreted the suggestion and it’s landed that way.

I enjoy being surprised.  You can see it is a passion for both of us 
and I know that it is for a lot of you.  When we get out there again 
tonight, all I want really is that you’re not happy just to be a 
mediocre hypnotist, who can just do it here and I know that works 
and I know I can get that, just push yourself forward.  Stretch 
yourself.  It is part of the human condition to stretch yourself and 
push yourself and learn new things.  The moment you stagnate, you 
are like the little kid who just thinks everyone is telling me I’m 
talented. No one else knows how to do hypnosis.  I’ll just stick with 
what I’ve got.  I know that is why you are here and I know you 
invested your money to learn new things.  So get out.  Use them.  
Find those little comfort zones that you need to bust through. 
 
Igor: 
Last night when we left, we kind of didn’t quite leave so we saw 
your results of what you were doing actually improved when we 
left.  That’s partly because now you’re the hypnotist.  You’re the 
show.  You’re the one that is in charge.  And you know it because 
we’re not there anymore to say that’s not good enough or all the 
rest of it.  Does that make sense to you guys?  We want that to 
happen today but remember take it easy.  Remember what we told 
you earlier.  Go out with each other.  Have a few drinks.  Don’t get 
lashed.  It is not about getting alcoholic confidence here.  Have a 
meal with each other.  
 
Anthony: 
There is nothing wrong with a pint or two.   
 
Igor: 
If you enjoy having a drink then have drink with a friend because 
you do. 
 
Anthony: 
Let me just say one little thing on that.  This came out from the 
place that I normally run my courses in the East End and there’s a 
hundred foot beer garden.  We’re all locked in there and it’s cool.  
It’s safe as anything.  We get there early, seven, half seven, hardly 
anyone there.  We stay there until midnight.  A few people will have 
a go at half seven and eight but it doesn’t really kick off until half 
nine or half ten.  And people have gotten a bit of confidence in the 
booze.  They’ve got a bit of confidence in seeing people do it.  
They’ve got that feeling of having nothing to lose.  We’re out for a 
laugh and people are enjoying it.  What tends to happen then is 
that it starts to get a bit too casual.  They start to swagger up to the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
303 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
table and they put their half empty pint down and say, “I’m a 
hypnotist.”  They are not pissed.  They are not slurring their words.  
“I’m performing in here this evening.”  “No you’re not.” “You’re 
clearly not.”   
 
A girl came up and said, “Those guys you’re working with are not 
professionals.”  I said, “They are all trained.  The fact is that most of 
them were magicians and different things.”  She said, “They’re not.”  
That was the reason she gave me.  I appreciate what Ben was 
saying.  I just got in a conversation.  If you’re sliding into it that way 
and then your saying, “I’m a hypnotist.”  Suddenly you are the most 
interesting person they have ever met, that’s fine.  That’s different.  
But if you are actually doing the approach cold walking up to 
people, then that beer bottle is going to another little life buoy for 
you to cling onto.  You’ll start doing strange things with it.  Just get 
rid of it.  Put it down.  You’re confident enough to walk in open.   
 
Igor: 
Remember you create the hype, you don’t believe it. Just because 
you’re a hypnotist doesn’t mean you roll up with your zipper 
undone, your feet on the table, half pint, saying, “I can make you do 
whatever I want. Alright guys, you stand up. Go over there.”  Now 
you stopped the doing the very things that make you a credible 
hypnotist, isn’t it?  You don’t turn up with an air of authority.  You 
don’t turn up with a sense of respect that they feel safe in their 
hands.  You stopped doing the very things that made you the 
hypnotist in the first place.   
 
So don’t believe the hype just because you are getting excited and 
all the rest of it.  Keep to your fundamentals, your basics.  You 
respect people.  You take care of people, physically in terms of their 
environment, emotionally in terms of what you’re doing with them.  
And you always compose yourself in an elegant, professional 
manner.  Doesn’t mean you’re stiff and rigid.  You can have a laugh 
with people. But you are representing your field, your industry, 
what you’re doing. So don’t get carried away because you have this 
crazy power.  That power will disappear in seconds when you stop 
doing the very things that got you there in the first place.   
 
Anthony: 
One other little thing when you’re out tonight with your tribe, is for 
those who are on the periphery, it’s easy once there are three of 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

four to find yourself on the edge, Bob’s leading again, he’s got 
another on, so on and so on, right? It’s not expecting you to pick up 
the crumbs that fall from Bob’s hypnotic table, but it’s kind of what 
I’m say, when you’re out as a group and you’ve got a group of 
people involved, you’ve had some fun with this person, you’ve 
haven’t really done your twenty minutes, you could say, “My friend 
here is a great hypnotist.  Can he show you something? He does this 
great routine.  You’ll love it.”  Try and open it up.  We’re not forcing 
anyone to do this.  Some people want to go home and consolidate, 
practice fine.  For some of you, who are still, yes, I want to do it, I 
want to do it, oh god the hours gone again, right, is start to share.  If 
someone has been hypnotized, I don’t really leave it to chance he 
loves being hypnotized.  Anyone want to?  I will say it, you love 
being hypnotized, you’re ready to have this experience again this 
evening. Have you met my friend? He’s a fantastic hypnotist. In fact, 
this is the guy that taught me. Say whatever it is that you’ve got to 
say.  Share the hypnotic wealth.   
 
Igor: 
Exactly, and remember even if you can’t go that far, why not do 
some trances with your friends out in public?  That just puts a little 
extra pressure on you, and yet you’ll have a lot of those 
connections going on.  And really there is absolutely no difference 
between me, my hypnotizing Alex in a street corner or in a bar or in 
some public place, and me hypnotizing a stranger. Right? The only 
real difference is that I’ve made the connection already.  It will 
easier emotionally for me.  In terms of what I have to do, the 
mechanics are identical.  Does that make sense?   You have lots of 
choice.  You do it with your friends. You do it with other people 
casually. You go for the cold approach. The range you have is huge.  
Enjoy it.  Make a meal of it.  Really do your stuff.  Really above all 
else, I hope you give people lots and lots of gifts.  I think it’s a really 
a great way for creating a climax for a nice little routine.  Amazing 
stuff has happened and then you were gracious enough to give 
them a hypnotic gift.  I think that’s an awesome thing to do. 
Everyone clear with that? 
 
 
In terms of groups, you know what, if you wish to stick in the 
groups A, B, C and D and so on, that’s fine.  Although, honestly at 
this point, just sort yourselves out into whatever groups or tribes 
you want to.  Stick together.  If someone says, “Can I join you?”  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Just say, “Sure, come along.”  If you like the look of a group, just 
latch onto them.  That’s part of what we’re doing here.  
 
Two things to watch out for, if you go to Leicester Square again, 
those of you who know it. One, there is a lot of teenyboppers there.  
They’re underage; they’re 18 years old, even if they’re drinking, 
because a lot of them will be.  They are still underage.  Please avoid 
that.  It’s in your best interest to do that.  Right? It’s very difficult to 
go “Yes, Mr. Policeman.  I’m not doing any hypnosis with an 
underage person who is drinking.”  Can you see the situation, 
especially if you’re a guy and it’s a girl? It gets very awkward very 
quickly. Don’t step into that boat.  You don’t’ need to.  Stick to 
adults who are clearly adults.   
 
Anthony: 
If you have some success, step it up.  Try and take as many people 
as possible through the set up and set piece.  Try and get ten, five, 
six – see the difference it makes to your comfort levels when you 
got six people all doing this.  Don’t miss the boat.  Observe.  Look 
closely, yes, there’s my person right there. I’m going to pick on him 
– 
 
Audience Member:  Time to take the show on the streets. 
 
Igor: 
It’s exactly that. For one of those people, you’ll turn into invisible in 
front of them. You will be Superman, flash from one corner of the 
building to another without them seeing, just amazing things will 
happen.  That’s when your confidence in your skills as a hypnotist 
go to another level.  Of course, it’s just that you had a great subject.  
It doesn’t mean anything in terms of your emotional experience. 
You’ll love that. 
 
Audience Member: Yes, you mentioned earlier that you’re going to give us a couple of 
tips for us multinationals.   
 
Igor: 
Oh, yeah, I’ll go into that more tomorrow but the simple version 
about that really quickly, is you’ve wired all your experiences in 
English right now.  That’s why it coded. That’s why it’s difficult to 
translate for you. So you need to go back inside your mind and 
think of the structures and processes we’ve created and retrain 
those in your national language, so you basically putting those same 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
306 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
ideas out in German, in French, in Spanish or whatever your 
language happens to be.  I’ll tell you this right now.  I’ve done 
hypnosis in English, Spanish and German, all three.  I’ve never 
actually tried French yet.  It’s way easier for me to do it in English 
than the other languages, way, way easier.  Why?  Because that is 
how I think as a hypnotist.  I actually, although I am a native 
German speaker, I have to translate my natural hypnotic language 
into German to do it in German because I’ve been doing it all along 
that way. Right? So it only since I haven’t trained that way. If you 
want to train yourself, do the things you’ve trained in English, in 
German, in French, in whatever language you want to do it in and it 
will cross over.  There comes a point where it will just tip.  And it 
goes, I’ve got it now. 
 
Anthony: 
If you’re working with people who are English, or if I’m working 
with someone who is not English – 
 
 Igor: 
Slow down. 
 
Anthony: 
I’ll say, “Look, you’ve got a great understanding of English, I can see 
that but I’m going to speak very clearly.  I want you to listen very 
closely to what I’m saying so I’m immediately hooking into their 
attention and I will just say, “If there is something I say that you 
don’t quite understand that’s fine.  Just let it go and continue to 
listen.”  Equally it’s the same sort of thing. It works both ways.  Just 
use it to narrow their attention down. 
 
Audience Member: Would you say that doing some sort of stiff arm or some other thing 
that requires a strong attention to some physical sensation in your 
body, would be a good way to distract from pain?   
 
Igor: 
It can be and it’s not the only vehicle.  There’s many vehicles.  
Ultimately, I wouldn’t think about it in terms of this is the best 
thing.  Just realize, it’s just a suggestion.  There are some 
suggestions that will work better than others, but that gets to a 
bigger sphere of looking at the psychodynamics of pain, which we 
don’t want to get into. Just treat is as a suggestion. “My arm is a 
healing touch.  It will now help you feel more comfortable and cool.  
That arm is stiff and rigid.  All the pain can go into the arm moving 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

away from the body.  When I touch the arm, it will release all that 
pain into the environment.  You’ll be free of pain.” 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah, if someone says, “I have a pain in my neck.” “So anytime that 
it’s worse?” “Yeah, it is worse when I’m stressed.” “Okay, put your 
arm out.  Put all the stress and tension into that arm.  In a moment, 
I will touch that arm and the stress and tension will disappear. 
You’ll find the levels of pain will be reduced, dah, dah, dah.” You’re 
taking away the mental portion of it.  You’re defining it.  As well as 
Igor was kind of framing there, it is just a signal and it has a 
purpose.  That’s often the way I’ll put it, I’ll just say, “Understand 
that it is worse on certain days and some of the time that is just 
based on how you feel.  Do you accept that?” “Yeah.” “Well, look, 
what we can definitely do is that I can show you how to let go of 
that portion of what you’re feeling.  Would that be good?” “Yeah.”  
Generally, look, get out there and have fun.  Get out there and give 
gifts.  Avoid pain control. 
 
Igor: 
I cannot see a single situation that will arise tonight where you will 
have to use it unless there is some big accident or something like 
that.  Really, even then, you want to get more hypnosis experience 
before you get involved.

Street Debrief 
 
Igor: 
Notice how the less we’re around, the better you guys get?  Anyone 
wonder why that might be?  It’s because now you’re the hypnotist.

You’re not looking to us like, like, what do I do next, what happens 
next?  You have to make up your own things.  You have to make up 
your own rules, go your own way.  That’s really how it should be.  
All we can do here is give you guidelines, give you some 
demonstrations, and then it’s up to you, really, to go out there and 
do stuff.  And isn’t it fun when you do?  Let’s get some kind of war 
stories from you guys.  What kinds of things did you end up doing?  
What kind of experiences did you end up having? 
 
Audience Member: A couple of others went out and we started working a crowd.  We 
got to one guy, and he wouldn’t play along at first, and then we 
separated out and you worked on the girl and she was cool.  I was 
working on the guy and I was doing the magnetic hands, and all of 
sudden, they got so far and they just wouldn’t move anymore.  And 
his friend was over his shoulder, “They’re not moving, they’re not 
moving.  His hands aren’t moving.”  So he’s looking down at his 
hands and his hands wouldn’t move.  So I thought, okay, what am I 
gonna do here?  So the hands aren’t moving.  I said, you know 
what, you’re right, the hands aren’t moving.   
 
And the reason why the hands aren’t moving is because you’re 
looking at the hands.  Don’t look at the hands, look at the space.  
Look at the space.  Notice the space shrinking.  Don’t look at the 
hands; look at the space.  Don’t look at the hands; look at the 
space, look at the space.  The space is shrinking, shrinking, 
shrinking.  His hands touched.  Bam, he was out. 
 
Igor: 
Fantastic.  Round of applause.  That’s awesome.  There’s an 
important principle in what he just did there, which is whatever 
experience they’re having is not wrong.  If you’re saying, oh, my 
God, you messed up, I’m gonna have to get someone else.  Well, 
you basically have blown a chance.  That looked, initially, like 
something that wouldn’t work out, but you did two things, you 
persevered, which is important, you carried on with suggestion, 
which is important, and really importantly, you didn’t make a big 
deal out of whatever was happening.   
 
Whatever is happening is the right thing.  And then you can’t really 
go wrong.  You’re still the hypnotist; you’re still doing great work, 
so thumbs up to you.  Well done.  Excellent.  Anyone else have

some war stories they want to share?  Clearly, we know where half 
the group last night was. 
 
Audience Member: It was really interesting yesterday, but I think the funniest part was, 
after all this, Alex and I went to the bar.  He was having dinner, I 
was drinking a beer.  And there was three guys just sitting next to 
us, and we just we like, we want to try something else.  Yes.  And 
we just tried when they were sitting, the – 
 
Igor: 
Oh, the irresistible arm levitation. 
 
Audience Member: Yeah, in the moment (arm goes right up).  And make a few starts 
like he cannot move the glass.  And actually, when he can move it, 
there is a kind of filter, he cannot lift to the mouth.  It was very 
funny.  It was really good. 
 
Igor: 
So you guys are doing some awesome stuff already.  Let me just ask 
you, how simple was it, just in a bar with a friend, and just to turn 
to someone and do the stuff off the cuff? 
 
Audience Member: No problem at all. 
 
Igor: 
It’s really easy, isn’t it, especially now that you’ve been on the 
streets and doing the hardcore version.  Just out with some friends, 
casually, and you see an opportunity, it’s relaxed, it’s easy, it’s 
natural, isn’t it?  So you guys have gone through, basically, shall we 
say the real deep end of the way hypnosis can be.  Anything kind of 
more to the shallow end is going to seem like a piece of cake to you 
guys now.  It really is.  And of course, everyone else watching is 
going to go, oh, how do you do that?  How do you have the courage 
to go talk to someone and do all this stuff?  Because I’ve done 
worse.  Any other war stories?   
 
So you had fun last night, right?  Did you enjoy taking your own 
time, doing your own thing, going your own directions?

Demo: Secret Gift 
 
Igor: 
So what we’d like to do today is we’d like to take this whole thing in 
a slightly different direction again.  Last night we left you with the 
idea of giving gifts.  Did you like the idea of giving gifts?  How many 
people gave some gifts last night?  Doesn’t it feel good to be able to 
do that?  And doesn’t that add a nice sort of rounding edge to the 
end of your performance?  It’s a nice way of leaving people, isn’t it?  
So what we want to do today is to be able to do that, leave people 
with those gifts, even when you’re not officially doing hypnosis, for 
whatever reason.   
 
To be honest with you, now it’s pretty easy to do the hypnotic gifts 
at the end of a demo in a bar or something like that, but sometimes 
it might be with a friend or it might be with a business colleague or 
you might just not feel like doing all this stuff around.  Some of you 
may have noticed there are certain areas of London where the 
police get nervous when people start gathering a crowd.  They think 
that someone’s gonna start mobbing Parliament or something, I 
don’t know.   
 
Audience Member: Leicester Square. 
 
Igor: 
Yes, Leicester Square, as the U.S. likes to call it.  Leicester Square is 
one, Covent Garden is another because they have the performance 
licenses handed out.  Leicester Square, they’re just nervous with 
people gathering.  The police will jump in, in those areas.  Other 
areas are fine.  But what if you’re in one of these areas or, for 
whatever reason, you don’t want to be doing some overt big demos 
and so on, but you still like the idea of giving people gifts?  
Wouldn’t it be worthwhile to take the skills that you already have 
and just translate it a little bit so you can do it totally covertly, so 
people don’t even need to know what’s happened; only that 
whatever it is was really good.  Would that be worthwhile? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Could I have a volunteer, please?  Let me work with him, he hasn’t 
been up yet.  Let’s move these chairs so we can have more a

conversation setting.  Have a seat over here in the hypno magic 
seat.  What’s your name again? 
 
Audience Member: Nieve. 
 
Igor: 
Nieve, of course it is.  Well remembered.  To some extent, this is 
going to be a little bit artificial because we’re not just chatting away 
and falling into a casual conversation.  So what I’m going to do now 
is we’ll do the best to just go into a normal flow of conversation and 
start switching it through into a conversational thing, and we’ll 
show you guys how to break it down.  Does that make sense?  So 
you had a good time last night? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
You went out a few times? 
 
Audience Member: A couple times. 
 
Igor: 
You enjoy it?  People liked the stuff you were doing? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah.  Finding it hilarious. 
 
Igor: 
Did you find it hilarious? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Did you find it hilarious?  
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
That’s important because you spent two days here, you’ve been 
working hard, and I don’t know about you – you may as well hold 
that as long as you can.  He’s like, I’m not letting go.  You work very 
hard at the things you’ve been doing here, and the very important 
thing is it hasn’t always been easy, has it?  There’s been times it’s 
been kind of emotionally challenging and so on, right? 
 
Audience Member: Uh-huh.

Igor: 
I appreciate that because there’s two things that come to my mind.  
One is when you go through a tough time, there’s always a payoff 
at the other end, and it’s important to keep your eye on that.  
When you get it, sometimes you appreciate why you went through 
the whole period before that.  It’s like – I’m not sure how long it 
was – maybe about a year or so ago, I went to a place I like to call 
the Nazi Yoga Boot Camp.  And the reason I call it that is very 
simple, it’s because they drilled you like you were a worthless piece 
of meat.  It was hysterical.   
 
So you’re up at 5:00 a.m., you’re running until you can’t run 
anymore, and then you come back, you do an hour of yoga, and 
then when your body’s totally, physically exhausted, you get to lie 
down in this mediation called Savasana.  It stands for the corpse 
position in yoga.  It’s more because you’re lying down and you’re 
exhausted.  It’s interesting when we’re going through the whole 
process because it was very tiring, you didn’t get much chance to 
think about stuff, you were just doing, doing, doing, learning 
something new, putting it into action, and so on.   
 
And it’s the reason certain principles come out, some of which I 
knew, of course, about before, and some that were just totally new 
to me.  For example, you may have heard this idea before, but 
where attention goes, energy flows.  I don’t know if you’ve ever had 
an experience of what that means.  This is quite a cool thing.  I think 
you’ll enjoy this.  Can I just borrow that a second?  Stand up for me, 
would you?  This is kind of interesting.  Just put your feet together 
and notice where your balance is.  So I’m going to push you here 
and notice your balance is, wherever it’s at.  So if you now put all of 
your attention up here, in the tip of your left ear, right there, just 
think about the tip of your left ear, what it feels like, the sensation.   
 
Let me know when all your attention is up there and keep it there.  
Just nod your head when it’s there. This is kind of weird. You got it 
there?  Just keep it there.  Notice what happens to your balance.  
Do you see how much easier it is to lose your balance?  This is 
where it gets really freaky.  Bring that attention down to your 
bellybutton, this whole area here around your bellybutton.  Let me 
know when you’re attention’s all the way down there.  Is it all the 
way down there?  Now again, don’t do anything, don’t resist or 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

anything in particular.  Just keep your attention down there and 
notice what happens to your balance.   
 
Do you see how much more solid you are?  It’s an old – I guess the 
yogis or whoever call it – I like to call it where attention goes, 
energy flows.  It’s weird, just by switching your attention to 
something, everything changes.  You’re either off-balance or on-
balance, depending on where your mind is at. 
 
Audience Member: It’s kind of like aikido.   
 
Igor: 
It’s kind of like aikido, exactly.  That’s why a lot of martial artists, 
actually, think about their – in Japanese it’s called oharo or 
whatever it is – they think about those areas because by placing 
their attention in those areas, they are literally more balanced.  
They’re able to do these amazing acrobatic moves without losing 
their balance in any ways.   
 
Now of course, I’m going to put my hand up and what’s all that 
about?  So of course, I’m glad you asked.  You’re familiar with the 
Indian chakra system, you have apparently different energy points 
and so on.  I’m not sure if I believe in the actual energy points and 
so on, but there is a very interesting thing that happens.  As we 
were going through the whole training, he gave us a similar 
demonstration to what we just did here about attention and energy 
and said, “This is how you open your inner centers.”  For example, if 
you take your hand and place it right about there on your chest, 
right about there, that’s known as the heart chakra.  You can 
probably feel a little bit of a pulse or the beating of your heart 
there.   
 
And it’s not important that you have your hand there, although 
having your hand there can help because it just gets you in touch 
with that particular location.  What’s really interesting is what 
happens when you put your attention on something.  For example, 
he said if you think about someone you care about, someone you 
really love, you can’t help but feel that heart chakra opening up.  
And having your hand there, of course, just intensifies the 
sensation.  First, I didn’t know what he meant.  I just thought, all 
right, I’ll give it a go.  And I thought of someone, my father, I respect 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
314 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
him a lot, I love him, I’m very close to him.  And the strangest thing 
began to happen.   
 
I began to feel something intense, really like a warm – you know 
when your skin kind of tightens up a little bit and you get this whole 
emotional thing.  And as I had my hand right there, exactly where 
you have it right now, that warm glow was so intense that, at one 
point, I wasn’t sure where my hand began, where it’s in my body, 
where it’s in my hand.  The whole sensation just became one great 
big whole event.  All I knew was that I felt really good.   
 
Now, this is where it gets really interesting because the instructor 
was saying that you know that you’ve opened this particular center 
inside of you, because it’s not about whether it’s open right now, 
it’s about whether it stays open and or not, in other words, whether 
you can keep it open when you really need it.  And that’s one of the 
reasons he had us put our hand up, kind of like you have right now, 
is that you know you’ve opened it properly.  When you take your 
hand off and turn your mind to other things, as soon as that hand 
comes back, that glow begins again.  That’s right.  It’s kind of 
curious, isn’t it?  And this is something he actually warned us about.   
 
He said once you’ve got it, once you can do this, really, your ability 
to do this with other people is just natural because it’s just part of 
how people are, the whole group instinct, the herd instinct.  So if 
you start doing this with other people and just start feeling good, 
they’ll start feeling good, too, and they won’t even know why.  Try 
it for yourself.  Take your hand off.  And you feel however you do.  
As soon as that hand comes back on, notice what happens.  Doesn’t 
it come back?  Isn’t that a nice feeling?  I have no idea how it works.  
I’m lying.  I have no idea how it works, but it feels good, doesn’t it?   
 
And the real cool thing is that you can try it for yourself when you 
go out, when you’re meeting with your friends or when you meet 
someone new, whatever it is.  Simply just putting your hand there 
and feeling that, at least for me, what I found was that other people 
start responding to me very differently.  They start being more 
relaxed around me.  You know when you get that rapport, you 
really connect with someone in a simple way.  It just seems a lot 
easier to get that.  I guess it’s just because I’m going there first, I’m 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
315 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
kind of creating that group herd instinct or something.  Who knows 
how it works.   
 
Anyway, it was a pretty cool experience for me, and I hope you’ve 
had a least something like that whilst you’ve been here over the 
last few days, too.  Thank you.  Give him a nice round of applause.  
Do you guys have any questions for Nieve, in terms of his 
experiences of that, or was it pretty much straightforward?  Well, 
give a nice round of applause.   
 
So to some extent, getting into a regular conversation in front of a 
group of people, whilst you know about Conversational Hypnosis, 
yes, it’s not going to be the most natural thing, but the point is, I 
want you to notice a couple key points in what we were doing.  
Number one, did you notice how we switched at some point from a 
regular conversation, something else was going on?   
 
Did you notice how, at some point, it went from an interchange – I 
say something, you say something, I say something, you say 
something, to me doing most of the talking, most of the directing 
and him just doing the agreeing?  Did you notice that?  Did you 
notice how we pulled out of a normal conversational context and 
somehow it started turning off to something else?  Even though you 
might not necessarily be aware of exactly where that happened, 
you actually might, especially those of you who worked with me 
before.  We’ve come across some important moments in that.  We 
talked about yesterday about how we think that anchoring is just a 
covert form of a post-hypnotic suggestion.   
 
Did everyone here see the basic maneuvers of hypnosis being 
present?  Did we have attention?  Yes.  Did we get to a point where 
he wasn’t thinking critically anymore by asking the critical factor?  
Would that be fair to say?  Did we stimulate his unconscious, maybe 
his imagination, his emotions and stuff like that?  Did we have that?  
So we had, it would be fair to say, a hypnotic context, right?  And 
then we gave, shall we say, indirect instructions for a pairing 
between a physical trigger and an emotional response.   
 
Did you all spot that, as well?  Now, if you had spotted someone 
doing that in a restaurant, say, or sitting at a bus stop with a little 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
316 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
old lady who needed cheering up or something like that, would it 
not seem like these are just two people having an interesting 
conversation about something and nothing more?  Would it be fair 
to say that’s what’s going on?  That’s the covert element.  As 
hypnotists now, especially that you spend two days doing – you 
recognize a heart massage in what we just did, right?  So 
recognizing and doing this stuff overtly for the last two days, you 
can recognize the big maneuvers in what we did, can’t you?   
 
So what I want to focus on today is giving you the skills or the 
toolkit that’ll allow you to translate any gift into a covert gift so you 
can start doing covert Street Hypnosis.  Would that be of interest to 
you guys? 
 
Audience Member: Yep. 
 
Igor: 
Great.  So let’s start.  Everyone do that technique.  Go.  I may have 
rushed it a bit.   
 
 
Covert Language 
 
Igor: 
So what we’re gonna do then, we’re gonna start off with a little bit 
of motion, just to get your minds in the right place, and then we’ll 
come back, bring the chairs back, and we’ll actually start putting the 
stuff into practice.   
 
Some of you who have trained with me before, you’ll be familiar 
with the exercise drills we’ll be doing in a moment.  These are just 
to get your language skills up because in Conversational Hypnosis, 
you will need slightly more elaborate language skills than for Street 
Hypnosis, just because the medium demands it.  Otherwise, you 
become a little more obvious what you’re doing.   
 
It doesn’t have to be hugely more complex, the language.  There is, 
of course, layers of sophistication you can take it to, but you need a 
little bit more smoothness with it.  And as I say, for those of you 
who’ve done this before, just bear with me.  We’ll build on a couple 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
317 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
layers and we’ll put it all together into a nice, neat package for you 
at the end of this process.  So the first thing we’re going to do is get 
you used to the idea of hypnotic language.  How does the 
unconscious mind reason?  What have we been doing for the last 
two days?  Any ideas? 
 
Audience Member: Hypnosis. 
 
Igor: 
Hypnosis is part of what we’re doing here.  It’s basically the law of 
association.  If x is happening whilst y is happening, if they get 
paired, then x is the same as y or x leads to y.  You push a button, 
the lights come on.  You push a button, lights come on.  You push a 
button, the light doesn’t come on, you go, what the heck?  What’s 
this?  Or you see through something, you can walk through it.  You 
see through it, you can walk through it.  Suddenly, you go bang, 
what the heck?  Oh, there’s glass here.  It’s just the way your 
unconscious mind reasons.  So the language we’re gonna start 
focusing on now works in many layers, but the simplest layer is you 
can associate one idea with another.   
 
For example, if I say to you, you want to learn this language 
because it makes life easier for you, well, that sounds like a 
reasonable idea, doesn’t it?  But I’m linking two ideas, learning the 
language, making life easier.  How do I link it with a simple, what I 
call linguistic bridge?  It’s a conjunction that fits those two ideas 
together.  Does that make sense?  So I don’t want you to think 
about this too much.  In fact, the less you think about the following 
exercises, the easier they will be for you.  Let me reemphasize that.  
The less you think about the following exercises, the easier they’ll 
be for you and the quicker you’ll get them.   
 
So what I’m going to do is I’m going to walk you – we’re going to 
start walking around.  Let’s get a little bit of energy in the room.  
Walk around, point at things, and just say what they are.  Just call 
them what they are, but as quickly as you can so you are having 
trouble coming up with the words.  Off you go.   
 
Now we’re gonna go the same way now, only I want you to use the 
word, “because,” and then attach two things, x because y, for 
example at the end.  I want them to be totally random.  The carpet 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
318 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
is here because their agreement in space.  Does that make sense?  
Is that logical in any way?  Is that rational or reasonable?  Good.  
That’s exactly what we want.  We do not need to make any sense 
with this.  We just want two random concepts linked together with 
that phrase, because.  Does that make sense to you guys?  Walk 
around the room and just shake someone’s hand and tell them 
you’re wearing a bracelet because I am the pope.   
 
Go around and come up with as many random statements as you 
can.  Don’t use the same one.  The idea is that your brain is at the 
point where it can’t quite keep up with what you’re thinking about.  
Off you go.  Was it easy?  This because that?  Is that easy to do? 
 
Audience Member: Yep. 
 
Igor: 
Some people having a little bit of difficulty, not making sense with 
it, is that right? 
 
Audience Member: It was difficult to come up with something after you’ve done so 
many people.  All of a sudden, for me, I was being blocked. 
 
Igor: 
That bit’s where you have to start trusting your unconscious.  It’s 
when you’re consciously trying to come up with content, that’s that 
block you’re sensing, which is excellent.  To do great Conversational 
Hypnosis, you cannot use your conscious mind.  Full stop.  It doesn’t 
mean that you just go out and then something else happens.  What 
happens is your conscious mind kind of steers where things go, but 
everything else is happening unconsciously.  So what you’re 
experiencing right now is exactly prefect for you because it’s going 
to show you the moment where you release that idea of I don’t 
know what to say and let anything come out.  Honestly, it can be 
complete garbage.   
 
In fact, it should be right now.  Then you are starting to create that 
connection with your unconscious that starts that flowing.  Once it 
starts flowing, then you can shape the stream to go somewhere.  
Does that make sense to you guys?  So that’s why I say, does it feel 
a little bit like you’re standing on the edge of something, you’re 
about to fall off?  Does it feel a bit like that to you guys?  Would 
that be fair to say?  That’s exactly what you want because that’s 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
319 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
when you have to trust your unconscious, which is what we want, 
right.  So I want to do another version of that, which is the word, 
“whenever.”  Whenever x, y.  Whenever this, that.   
 
Whenever I speak to you, the heavens shine upon me.  I’m having a 
particular religious theme today, it looks like.  Whenever the chair 
stands there, you’ll have a religious experience, too.  Whenever the 
sun shines, it’ll rain.  It does not have to make any sense.  In fact, I’d 
prefer it not to.  But what I want is speed, I want to get to that point 
where you don’t know what to say, but you’ll say something 
anyway.  And if the formula’s simple, it does not have to make 
sense.  Hence, anything will do.  Does that make sense?  Go around, 
do some more.  Off you go.   
 
All right, now you’re getting in the spirit of it.  See how you’re 
having fun because, in a weird way, you’re doing less?  So we’re 
going to do the same thing again.  This time I want you to use both 
phrases together, right.  Because the carpet is here and God is 
shining upon us, whenever we say something, it won’t make any 
sense and you like that.  All you’re doing is you’re putting because 
and whenever into the same sentence.  Now you have four units.  
Because this, so that.  Whenever this, that.  So it’s four statements 
you’re somehow connecting together.  Does that make sense to 
you?  Go ahead. 
 
Audience Member: If you go into gibberish – 
 
Igor: 
Gibberish is fine, as long as you’re not like, blah, blah, blah.  We 
want real words to come out, it’s just they don’t have to make any 
sense.  Let me reemphasize this.  What you are saying should not 
make any logical sense.  If you’re saying because there are blue 
colorless deer floating in the sky, it means that the carpet has inner 
decrepitudes, which whenever they arise, there is a small butterfly 
in Venus.  Hopefully, that does not make sense to anyone here, 
right?  If it does make sense to anyone, please take your drugs this 
morning and we’ll continue.  Does that help you?   
 
We really are not looking for sense; we’re looking now just for a 
pure linguistic thing.  It’s actually going to be a little harder for you 
to do this way because you have to trust your unconscious more.  

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
320 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
That’s where all this crazy stuff is at.  But then it’ll get a lot easier as 
we get along.  Off you go.   
 
So let’s add another layer now, shall we?  Let’s just use the word, 
“as.”  As this, so that.  Simple flow, right?  As the carpet rests here, 
our spirits are improving.  Or to get a little more bizarre, as the cars 
pass outside, the color jumps in happiness.  Again, it really doesn’t 
matter what you’re saying.  The point is you’re just going for that 
construction.  Does that construction make sense, as x, so y?  As x, 
y.  So let’s just do all three together, because, whenever, as.  Would 
you like an example? 
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Because the world exists, whenever we stand and think about 
things that we’re not doing, butterflies fly in Venus as we consider 
the things that we haven’t said yet.  I really don’t know what I’m 
saying, honestly.  At this point, I could be a dribbling idiot.  But it 
doesn’t matter.  The point is we’re getting used to the flow of 
language and when we start putting real things in, it just gets really 
easy.  So are you guys feeling a little bit more like you’re being 
pushed on the edge of something and you’re feeling that much 
closer to falling off?  That’s good.  Off you go.  Fall off. 
 
All right, guys.  Now you’re getting it.  I’m liking this.  Do you feel 
the vibe?  Shall we take it up another level?  So what are the three 
power words we have so far: because, whenever, as.  Those are 
easy to remember, aren’t they, because, whenever, as.  And you 
can use them in any order.  It doesn’t matter what order it is.  Let’s 
throw in two more power words.  The words we’re using aren’t 
really that important, in terms of which specific ones I choose.  
These are just coming out random.  Some are a little bit more 
important than others.  So the next two we’re gonna have is “which 
means” and, very simply, the word, “and.”  The carpet is green, 
which means it’s green.  I know, it’s crazy, isn’t it.   
 
My advanced language pattern magic is really bamboozling you.  
And the word, “and.”  And x, and y.  And you can listen to me and 
think thoughts.  That’s kind of a little more senseless.  Let’s get a 
little more crazy than that.  And there’s a red color and there’s a 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
321 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
budgie in the window.  It really doesn’t matter what you’re 
connecting together.  You just see how the word, “and” connects 
two ideas somehow.  So now we’re going to use all five words of 
power simultaneously – well, not simultaneously – in a sequence.  
The sequence is irrelevant, as long as you remember to use 
because, whenever, as, which means, and, and.   
 
We’re running through the world because we have to find a budgie.  
Whenever the birds fly through the sky, you’ll discover butterflies in 
Venezuela today.  Why not?  As soon as those butterflies have 
something to do, you’ll discover the carpet in this room, which 
means it won’t be outside where the cars find red butterflies and 
have wheels.  So it’s a little bit more tricky now, isn’t it?  But the 
beauty of this is you don’t have to make sense yet.  So you’re okay.  
Off you go. 
 
All right, guys.  Who feels a little bit crazy now?   
 
Audience Member: Oh, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Let’s make your life easier, shall we?  Let’s start making a little bit of 
sense.  Wouldn’t that make life easier for you guys?  Now we’re just 
going to change half of the equation.  In other words, I don’t care 
which half – what you associate to something.  In other words, it 
could be the carpet, it could be trains, it could be butterflies in 
Venus, I don’t care.  What I care about is the second half of the 
equation, the why half of the equation.  Because x, y or as x, y and 
so on.  The second half I’d like to be something that feels hypnotic.  
How do you feel when you guys go into hypnosis?  Do you feel 
comfortable?  Do you feel relaxed?   
 
Would it be fair to say if someone feels comfortable and relaxed, 
their chances of going into hypnosis are a little higher than in their 
normal, day to day things?  Would that be fair to say? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
So now, what you’re going to do is swap out some of the crazy 
words and put in words like relaxation and comfort.  But you still 
don’t have to make sense yet.  We’re still not looking for logic or 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
322 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
reason.  That’ll come later, I promise you.  So for example, because 
the lampshade is above, you can relax.  Whenever you relax this 
way, the cars will pass by outside.  As the cars pass by outside, 
you’ll feel more comfortable, which means you’ll relax and feel 
more comfortable.  So the only thing I’m looking for is to fit those 
words, “relax” and “comfort” anywhere in our sequence and fill it 
up with random other stuff whilst using my five words of power.   
 
So actually, it takes a little bit of the craziness out and makes it a 
little bit easier for you, but you still don’t have to make sense, it 
doesn’t have to be logical.  You’re just looking to fit the power 
words and the, what I call hypnotic themes, relaxation and comfort, 
somehow into the mix.  Does that make sense to you guys?  Easy to 
do or do you want to have another example?  You’ll just go and do 
it.  Off you go.  If you do happen to make sense by accident, all 
right, but it’s more about linking comfort to any part of their 
experience, part of being the human race.   
 
Anthony: 
And again, we’re not asking you to over think it.  If you’re struggling 
to find that sentence, say what you see, as you stand there, as you 
hear me, as you’re in this room, just say what you see. 
 
Igor: 
Great tip.  Off you go, guys. 
 
Did you enjoy the exercise?  Pretty interesting, isn’t it?  What we’re 
going to be doing is we’re going to keep layering these things and 
just slightly refining and tweaking with the mechanisms until you 
can do a full-blown covert conversation induction within it, 
including all the gifts and so on.  Is that okay with you guys?  So far, 
we’ve taken the idea  of the five power words, would it be fair to 
say that they’re now relatively easy to introduce without too much 
thought?  Is that fair?  Relatively.  I’m not asking for mastery yet.  
You’ve only been doing this for 20 minutes.  We don’t expect 
masters; we just mean relatively easy, relatively smooth.   
 
Would it be fair to say that it’s relatively easy and relatively smooth 
introducing hypnotic ideas, like comfort, relaxation, focus, would 
that be fair to say?  It’s a little trickier, but it’s still relatively easy, 
yes?

Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
We’re in a good place.  Now, again, we added another layer of 
trickiness by talking about someone’s experience or just being a 
human being, and then attaching the idea of comfort or relaxation 
to that in whatever way.  Logic is irrelevant right now.  It’s just a 
question of can we attach the two together somehow and keep 
talking.  That got a little bit trickier, didn’t it?  But you still managed 
and coped relatively well, right?  The reason I’m trying to pull all 
these different things out was because when you go home, you’ll 
have a chance to practice these things, get tighter over Skype, over 
the phone or whatever, and do these things with each other.   
 
Anthony, I think it was your question, yesterday, about how do we 
do this in other languages, you do exactly what you’re doing now.  
You start with a very simple idea, and you start evolving it.  The 
simple idea was the power words.  You start evolving it over time 
into more complex hypnotic themes and so on.  Does that make 
sense?   
 
 
Parallel Realities 
 
Igor: 
The next layer I’d like to introduce right now is very simple.  It’s a 
slight alteration on what we’ve done, and we’re going to do two 
simple things.  The first thing is – and it’s going to be really 
important for doing covert Street Hypnosis here – is we’re going to 
introduce a level of ambiguity.   
 
I call this a parallel reality, so that there are two different worlds 
that you’re speaking about at the same time, one that they 
understand consciously, one which they’ll get unconsciously.  And 
we’ll show you how to do that later.  For the moment, the simplest 
way of achieving this – it’s a very simple device – not the only 
device, but it’s the simplest device – is what’s called a switch of 
referential index.  Now, that’s just really cool talk or really nerdy 
talk, depending on how you look at it, for saying you’re going to 
change from the third person to the second person.  So you’ve 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
324 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
already introduced a third person idea, haven’t you, human 
experience?   
 
People can do this, people are like that.  Then you switch onto 
second person, you.  The way we’re going to do this is remember 
we had this x, y equation, because x, so y, x and y, and so on?  Think 
of the x as a third person, the people can, people are.  Think of the 
y as second person, you.  Now, on the y side, what are we doing 
with the y?  Are we talking about general experiences or about 
hypnotic themes, relaxing, comfort, and so on?  What’s the y 
about? 
 
Audience Member: Themes. 
 
Igor: 
So if you can keep all these concepts together in your mind, all 
we’re going to do now, and this is very simple, is talk about people, 
introduce a power word, and then introduce a hypnotic theme in 
the second person.  And I’ll give you an example.  May I use this for 
this?  I’m not even going to try to introduce the reason for talking 
about people; I’m just going to launch into the middle of it and we’ll 
clean up the context and so on and we go through it.  Because 
people have bodies, they find that you can relax and feel 
comfortable.   
 
Anthony: 
Experts in hypnosis agree that when people focus, they 
automatically begin to calm down. 
 
Igor: 
People wear shoes just so you can feel comfortable. 
 
Anthony: 
Sociologists have pointed out that floppy haired prefect types find it 
easier to access their creative resources.   
 
Igor: 
Oh, I was a prefect. I like that one.   
 
Anthony: 
Sorry, I’ll get a grip. 
 
Igor: 
We all have bodies; which means you can feel comfort in that body. 
 
Anthony: 
When people feel comfortable in their body, I think that you can 
notice that and begin to empathize with some of those feelings.

Igor: 
And of course, everyone has aspirations that you can focus on.  Do 
you see where we’re going with this?  Do you see how much easier 
it is than it really sounded when we put all these complex things 
on?  It’s still a little clunky because we’re switching in a very hard 
way between the persons, and it’s very obvious.  There are 
subtleties you can introduce to make it easier, but I don’t mind for 
now because this is just an exercise to get you used to the idea.  I 
like this training version.  I think it’s quite nice because it actually 
gives you a little bit more room to play with it.   
 
All you’re gonna do is you’re gonna introduce some form of human 
experience.  Really, it gives you carte blanche.  You guys have been 
alive for some time, is that right?  Would that be fair to say?  You 
weren’t unpacked yesterday, right?  Work with me here.   
 
Audience Member: Yes.   
 
Igor: 
You all have had experiences in life.  That means you know what it 
means to be a human being.  It could be something as mundane as 
people get dressed in the morning, which means you can relax 
about life.  Does that make sense?  No, it didn’t.  And it felt like it 
didn’t. 
 
Anthony: 
Just look at the patterns you’ve just learned with the two sides, and 
really, what you’re gonna add is people or some nominalized 
experts or such-and-such a group have noticed that when you do 
this, you can be aware of that, and just end with you can be aware 
or noticed or realize or you feel or you become or you focus or you 
are. 
 
Igor: 
Do you understand how that works?  It’s a very simple backwards 
and forwards.  I quite like the tradeoff because it means you throw 
out one of these lines, they’ll throw them back and go, oh, I like 
that, and you’ll keep switching backwards and forwards that way.  
Just think of this as a drill.  It’s not an induction yet; it’s just a drill to 
get familiar with the kind of language we will need in order to give 
covert gifts.   
 
Anthony: 
Experts encourage people to drill so that you can learn this.

Igor: 
I’m not saying you’re gonna feel comfortable as you’re doing this, 
but people have been known to enjoy this exercise.  See where I’m 
going with it?  All right guys, find a different partner, standing, 
sitting, I don’t care, and just trade lines this way and just get used to 
this flow.  The key here is to flow. 
 
 
All right, guys, it looks like you’re enjoying that.  Is that fun? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Now isn’t it weird – it’s that easier than the exercise you were doing 
before? 
 
Audience Member: Oh, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Just consider what you’re telling me.  You’re telling me it’s easier to 
make sense and present hypnotic suggestions than to speak 
nonsense.   
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
So it’s easier to limit yourself than to have complete free range of 
what you say. Wow!  That’s interesting.  Would you like another 
limit to make it easier?  So here’s what we’re going to do now.  
You’ve got this idea of trading backwards and forwards, and it’s 
coming out relatively smoothly, right?  We are striving for 
smoothness, that’s one of the keys to Conversational Hypnosis.  Any 
bump on the road can alert them back to consciousness.   
 
Conversational trances, at least in the initial phases, can be a lot 
more fragile than regular hypnotic trances, just because they don’t 
know they’re supposed to be in them.  Does that make sense?  
There are ways you can cheat and make them more robust and so 
on, but we’ll see if we can get onto that later.  So we need 
smoothness to prevent any kind of obstacles arising as we go along.

Hypnotic Vehicles 
 
Igor: 
So what I want to do now is, again, with a different partner, I want 
you to sit down and do something similar.  We’re going to use a 
very mild vehicle to allow you to talk to them.  For example, we 
might say something like, I’d like to talk to you about people, if I 
may.  I’ve set a theme, haven’t I?   
 
I’ve set a context the conversation is going to go in, have I not?  
Now, this is not the world’s greatest hypnotic vehicle.  It isn’t.  I 
totally admit that.  But we’re now getting used to producing 
vehicles inside of which our hypnotic Conversational Hypnosis 
elements will start working.  Does that make sense to everyone?  So 
at that point, the only other thing you can do is you can layer your 
own lines, so rather than having to trade backwards and forwards, 
you’re going to be doing all the talking for about, say, three or four 
minutes.  And the key idea I want you to keep in the back of your 
mind now is don’t monitor the language so much.   
 
Let it come out as it does.  Just make sure that those five power 
words get sprinkled along kind of generously as you go along.  The 
key idea I want you to have inside your mind is you want your 
partner to feel comfortable, that’s it.  You want them to be relaxed 
or feel comfortable.  And when you speak to them, you’re gonna 
have your mind full of that feeling yourself.  You want them to feel 
that.  So when you say, “relax,” you don’t say, “relax.”  Is that a 
relaxing thought?  You better feel comfortable.  Or else.  You see 
how my own emotional state changes the meaning of what I’m 
saying.  Would that be fair to say?   
 
So I’m looking for you to feel the very comfort you want them to 
feel and put that into your voice.  I’d like to talk to you about 
people, if I may.  People fascinate me because they feel 
comfortable in the strangest of places.  Whenever people are out 
and socializing, they think they might have a phobia, but really, the 
comfort comes all by itself.  Consider it.  There’s people on a bus 
and they feel comfortable just sitting there surrounded by complete 
strangers.  Whenever you sit on a bus, I know you don’t feel that 
comfortable straight away.  But I know for a fact there have been 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
328 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
times when you sat on that bus and just relaxed.  You didn’t care 
about anything else.   
 
People fascinate me because they can feel relaxed in the most 
unusual places.  Aside from all the relaxation that is normal, lying in 
bed and feeling tired, going to sleep at night, that comfort is a great 
one, all the other things we know about, you sitting in a massage 
table, someone’s got their hands, and you have that deep, soothing 
comfort.  People’s ability to just feel comfortable, it’s just immense.  
For example, I know a mountain climber.  He’ll actually look for a 
challenge because he knows it means he can relax.  He really knows 
he can relax.  I’m not saying that everyone relaxes this way.  Some 
people just take a deep breath and relax. I don’t know why. You 
know what I do when I relax?  It’s the strangest thing.  That’s right, I 
do.  I close my eyes.  I don’t know why I do it.  Nice round of 
applause.   
 
I am actually not looking for eye-closers, by the way.  You realize 
this.  In a normal conversation which turns hypnotic, it’s still 
relatively uncommon to get eye closure unless you switch into what 
I would call a semi-covert induction so they know something’s up, 
they just don’t know quite how to label it.  But we’re not going to 
go down that road just yet.  I’m not looking for eye closure.  I don’t 
care about eye closure.  All I care about is when I watch my partner, 
do I see the signs of the hypnotic theme that I’m introducing.  My 
theme was comfort and relaxation.  Was that pretty apparent?   
 
Did we see our subject beginning to experience comfort and 
relaxation?  Yes?  Did you hear the quality of comfort and relaxation 
being providing in the tonality of my voice, in the rhythm of my 
speech?  Would that be fair to say?  And other than that, really, 
we’re doing exactly what you were doing a moment ago, weren’t 
we?  We’re talking about people, as a rule, we’re using our power 
words to link the idea of relaxation and comfort.  It doesn’t have to 
be a rigid thing like, oh, every time I say, “people,” I’m actually 
saying that because – and therefore – I’m not being that rigid.   
 
I’m just having a general chat, and my mind, my intellect, all its 
doing is monitoring for our few power words coming out and am I 
emphasizing relaxation and comfort, and then am I sticking roughly 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
329 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
to my theme, which is people, which is, hopefully, a very large 
theme you can stick to.  So really, it’s exactly what you just did a 
moment ago.  I don’t care about logic, I don’t care about sense, I 
just care about you running the conversation on your own for a few 
cycles.  Is that straightforward enough?  So go ahead and find a 
different partner and let’s just spend three to five minutes apiece 
and then switch over and the other person gets three to five 
minutes.   
 
And you’re not looking for anything other than that they are 
relaxing.  And as soon as that happens, you’re in, just keep that 
going. 
 
Anthony: 
It’s a bit like me doing the direct stuff when I was saying I’m 
constantly putting in odd little suggestions, a little probe, just 
looking for some feedback, like magnetic hands and the eyes are 
closed.  And when they touch, it’s gonna freak you out a little bit.  
It’s an innocuous suggestion, but I’m looking for, oh, my God.  And 
I’m gonna claim that as my own when I do this.  So you can begin to 
relax.  I’m trying to feel it through my arm.  So in this situation, just 
its gonna make your observation more acute if you have some 
belief and some intentions, still, in your suggestions.   
 
Those mountain climbers find a challenge, apparently, you can 
begin to relax, even in that context where you have to take a deep 
breath before you move ahead and take something on.  I’m not 
resisting Igor, I’m feeling it the whole way, but I’m guessing, unless 
you know exactly what you’re looking for, then you may miss it.  
But the fact is, when I’m hearing those words, when I’m on a bus, 
yeah, I’m now revivifying a memory of falling asleep and actually 
getting to the end of the line and I did that journey lots and lots of 
times.   
 
So without complicating it, there’s lots going on that’s being carried 
by this vehicle, these few language patterns, and my back’s 
relaxing, my face is kind of changing color slightly.  It must be the 
3:00 a.m. finish.  But my face, I felt a temperature shift.  I felt my 
breathing shift.  I felt Igor noticing all those things and nodding and 
saying, that’s right.  It wasn’t even that obvious, to be honest, but I 
knew – a bit like when you’re being hypnotized and you think, I’m 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
330 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
starting to go, yeah.  I’m starting to lift.  It’s the same sort of 
experience here.   
 
Obviously, I know that something’s occurring.  In the real world, 
they’re not going to have a clue.  They’re going to sit there and 
breathe and sit back in their chair. 
 
Igor: 
To add to what Anthony’s saying, I want to just pull out this point 
because this is very, very important.  You’ve hit the nail right on the 
head.  The thing that makes this easy is, as a hypnotist, I see my 
subject already relaxing.  I see him sitting there going like, ah.  
That’s my mental picture.  Now, anything he does that goes more in 
that direction, I’ll smile to myself, I might even nod a little bit, just 
because I’m going yes, I’m on the right track because I’m looking for 
those things.  Does that make sense?  If you’re looking for him to be 
relaxed or her, in this case, then you’ll find it.   
 
If you’re looking for anything to happen, like, I don’t know what’s 
going to happen, well then, there’s going to be less things going on.  
So you’re looking for that constantly, and that’s going to alter your 
attitude, it’s going to alter your voice, and you’re creating a 
biofeedback loop between the two of you.  Does that make sense?  
You’re now that machine that goes, ping, in the Star Trek movies. 
You’re that machine.  Just don’t go, ping.  Say words.  So find a 
different partner and let’s just spend five minutes apiece, ten 
minutes in total.  Just really play with this.  Go to town.  Flow 
smoothly.  Don’t think too much about it.  The sense is irrelevant.  
Off you go. 
 
 
So I’m presuming from the slight difficulty in getting you guys back 
that you enjoyed the exercise?   
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Was it good? 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Was it relatively easy? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
331 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Did you notice how, at first, you’re thinking too much and it’s kind 
of difficult to get the words out?  But there comes in a point, and it 
might come intermittently, at first, where it just suddenly flows for 
a while.  Then you catch yourself thinking and you’re trying to say 
something clever, and as soon as you try and say something clever, 
it gets really stupid.  Have you experienced that?  So this is 
something I learned from improv, which is the golden rule is don’t 
try and be clever.  Don’t try and be funny.  Don’t try and be smart.  
In fact, try to be as simple and basic and boring as possible, and 
that’s when pure genius comes out.   
 
I have had the best reactions from people coming back and saying, 
“That was the most amazing thing ever,” from when I was doing 
stuff that I thought was just almost embarrassingly simple.  So 
really, do not try and make it complex.  The complexity, that’s what 
your unconscious mind does.  It’ll feed all that stuff in.  There’s 
many, many layers you can put in, but it’s not up to you to try and 
put them in.  Your job is just to do the exercise and stick to the basic 
principles and then really, really cool stuff starts coming out.  
Hopefully, you’re getting a little bit of experience of that.  Would 
that be fair to say?  So let’s turn it over to you guys a little bit.  Is 
there anything you want to add before we do? 
 
Anthony: 
If it’s not complicating things, I wouldn’t mind just mentioning a 
couple phrases you can use to encourage a bit of ambiguity on the 
back end of these sentences.  This is how I kind of shave off a lot of 
the little bumps.  At the moment, we’re making an illogical 
connection that will just be accepted because you’re stating it like it 
should.  As you sit on the floor, you can begin to relax or as people 
sit on the floor, you can begin to relax.  There’s no real reason why 
those two things should be together.  In fact, I used the extra bit of 
phrasing there.  That’s how commonly I use it, which is not just as 
people sit on the floor, you can relax.   
 
I tend to just, just like when I’m doing the direct stuff, just make the 
suggestion portion of the sentence, just pitch it ever so slightly in 
the future so I’m not actually committing anything to the response.  
If they didn’t respond at all, it wouldn’t matter.  So the words I use 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
332 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
are, “you can begin,” “you can notice,” and “you may be aware.”  
So it’s kind of aware, realize, and notice at the core.  So when 
people nod their head in this way, you can get that feeling that 
you’re being understood.  And when someone’s talking, and you 
feel like you’re being listened to, it becomes easier.  And so on and 
so on.  So for me, one way of taking some of the edges off of this is 
just to add some ambiguity.   
 
You might notice, you can become aware, you can realize.  It’s the 
same thing as your eyes will begin to change focus.  I’m not actually 
saying anything.  I’m not saying they’re sleepy, they’re tired, they’re 
closing.  I’m saying your eyes can begin as you become aware of 
your eyes – I can’t even speak anymore.  As your hand moves 
toward your face, your eyes will begin to change focus.  I’m not 
actually stating that it’s happening or not happening.  And it’s the 
same when I do this kind of conversational stuff.   
 
I would just try and add a bit of ambiguity to the back end of that 
sentence until I get to the point where I’m feeling that my 
suggestions are landing, their breathing has shifted, they are 
looking more comfortable, they are absolutely focused on me, and 
then I’ll just turn it up a notch, just the same stuff we’ve been doing 
the last two days, just become more direct and give them a little 
jab, really.  Yeah, I’m into them now.  I’ve got a hook into them 
now.   
 
Igor: 
So what Anthony is describing there, and it’s a very important part 
of what we’re doing here, is what I would call language softener.  
These are things that take the certainty off what you’re saying a 
little bit, which at the beginning is a useful thing, but again, as 
Anthony was mentioning, you start receding as you go along.  Those 
are words like, begin to, start to, maybe, softly, slowly.  See where 
I’m going with this?  These are softening the responses slightly.  
And then your job is – we have a couple of moving pieces in this 
Lego puzzle, don’t we?   
 
We have the power words, like because, whenever, and so on, we 
have our hypnotic themes, like relax, comfort, and so on, whatever 
it is you end up using, we have the overall vehicle, in this case how 
people are fascinating, and then we have language softeners, which 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
333 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
are placed every time – essentially the way I think of language 
softeners is you place them in every time that you’re not too sure 
what the response will be yet.  In other words, you’re presenting a 
new idea.  For example, let’s say I’m gonna send you all out into the 
streets right now.  Shock.  From all the comfortable stuff we’re 
doing in here to out in the street.   
 
So I have to soften the transition a little bit and say, look, you might 
consider going back to the street for a little bit.  Now I’m not saying 
we’re going to go right now, but when we begin to walk downstairs 
and go outside, you might actually start to feel more comfortable 
knowing that you’re confident about what you’re doing.  Does that 
make sense?   
 
Anthony: 
Earlier on, Igor made the statement of nothing they do is wrong.  
Some of you got some training already, you’d understand that.  This 
phrase, that’s right, that we all have a bit of a giggle at, is still a very 
useful phrase.  So if you accept that nothing they do is wrong, then 
by adding these language softeners, you’re opening up the 
potential they have to give you the right response, if that’s not 
illogical.  It just means that the response potential is widened in the 
same way, when we spoke yesterday directly about hand levitation, 
it makes no difference to me if it shoots up, if it’s a thumb 
twitching, if it’s a frown on their face, a sensation as they realize 
they’re beginning to feel something.   
 
All I’m trying to do is keep as many options open as I can and then 
gradually, gradually, gradually hone in the one that I’m going to 
commit to.  So when we’re doing this kind of conversational covert 
stuff, that’s what these language softeners do.  You might begin to 
notice certain sensations.  As you sit there, people often realize that 
when they begin to become aware of certain sensations, you can 
blah, blah, blah.  And then just direct it back into the person again.  
So it’s just aware, realize, notice, and begin to, you may – just it’s a 
good way of putting it.  It’s a softener. 
 
Igor: 
Is everyone having a good time so far? 
 
Audience Member: Yes.

Are you enjoying this stuff?  Is it useful for you? 
 
Anthony: 
Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Can you see how we’re beginning to transition a little bit from the 
street stuff we were doing to something more, shall we say, casual, 
so to speak?  Would you like to learn more?

How to Seamlessly Slip into a Covert                  
Hypnotic Conversation Anytime 
 
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor: 
So before we carry on, before we add any more layers to this, this is 
basically the foundational level for Conversational Hypnosis, for 
covert hypnosis that we’ll be used today for giving covert gifts, 
which means before we carry on with a few more layers and start 
tweaking it to make this the kind of induction we saw at the start, 
it’s an opportunity now for you guys to start asking questions and 
making comments in terms of what you’ve done or you have 
questions for us.  It’s useful for you guys to start throwing those 
things out now so that we’ll go that as a level playing field before 
we move on.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Does anyone want to say anything or ask anything?  So just stand 
up so we can see you as well, all right but stand to the side so the 
camera doesn’t see the back of your head. 
 
 
 
Audience Member: This is aimed at - basically we were having a conversation earlier 
where we were talking about when you’re using Conversational 
Hypnosis, sometime you go there first and you zone out before you 
realize what’s going on with the guy you’re talking to.  So I just want 
you to know  
 
 
Anthony: 
He hypnotized me now. 
 
Audience Member: Don’t start thinking about that now because if you did, you know 
what would happen don’t you? 
 
 
Yes, I just want to know if you’ve got any tips on being able to 
maintain, either to fractionate so that you’re always in control as 
opposed to you talking to person, trancing yourself out. 
 
Anthony: 
In my therapy room, just because of where I came from with all of 
this stuff, I use all these stuff as a matter of course.  This is, yes, I do 
a rapid induction, then I’ll give the person six-seven minutes of this 
kind of talk that you’ve been playing with today.  And obviously I’ve 
got the luxury in that situation, of they’ve got their eye shut.  So I 
kind of indulge myself in the therapy room, in that I get into it. As I 
talked about people, mountain climbers and the beach and da, da, 
da, whatever else I want to bring in as the vehicle. I sit back, I relax, 
I do a lot of my therapy with my eyes closed and it’s becomes a bad 
habit almost.  I had one client saying, look, he’s been sitting there 
with  his eyes closed and he doesn’t even know what I’ve been 
saying. 
 
[Crosstalk] 
[Laughs] 
 
Anthony: 
But they just closed me again anyway. But because I’ve got that 
luxury, I do and I think it’s useful to take myself into a trance state if 
that’s what you want to call it.  I went into the same kind of zone 
that they’re in. When you do this eyes open and conversational, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
336 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
you don’t have that the luxury, but personally, I still want to get as 
close to the thing I’m describing or the intent that I have for my 
having this conversation. I think that if I’m feeling it and if I’m 
pacing myself based on those feelings I’m going to be more 
effective.   
 
If I’m going to talk about sensations and you can begin to notice as 
you feel the air conditioning blah, blah, blah then I’m going to 
pause long enough to feel it and it’s going to take me a little bit 
closer to where I’m trying to get that person.  That only becomes a 
problem as you said, if you noticing that you’re actually starting to 
go into it. You might start to lose track of what you’re doing, okay?  
If you’re aware of that then I would just say, know where your level 
is and for me it’s partly dictated by my posture, so I can still feel 
perfectly relaxed and centered and kind of empty and still, but I can 
be sitting up and watching, okay?   
 
I kind of know that my eyes aren’t going to shut and I’m just going 
to stop talking or it become nonsensical. So for me it’s just about  
knowing your level, recognizing that just because you’ve gone into a 
bit of a hypnotic state but that doesn’t mean you have to slide all 
the way down into it.  In this context, to be honest, because you’re 
being repeatedly hypnotized and you’re a capable subject, it 
doesn’t surprised me that you’re being sucked back down that 
road. It depends on where you’re sitting in the room but as we’re 
talking about this stuff and giving demos, frequently people are 
closing their eyes and getting sucked back into it because it’s 
becoming anchored to the voice and the phrasings and the tempo 
and the rhythm.   
 
So my advice is just kind of find your level and I use to call it an 
uptime trance, but just find your level and recognize that, and 
you’re likely to be more effective in terms of your pacing and 
phrasing and your intent, if you are feeling some of that. But if you 
need to pull yourself back, then just do it with your posture, do it 
with your breathing.  I don’t know if you’ve got other advice? 
 
Igor: 
Yes, I mean very simply if you wait about ten minutes, while we 
deal with the other questions, the very next exercise is exactly for 
that, right? 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
337 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
 
Anthony:  
Right.  
 
Igor: 
And to give you say a slightly longer version of the answer, is, the 
reason it’s happening to you is because so far, the only place you’ve 
been training to have trance experiences is when someone is 
putting you into trance.  So you put all trance experiences into the 
do-nothing-room which is why it starts sucking you down that way. 
Whereas what we need to do now, especially as Conversational 
Hypnotists, is create another room, which has equally powerful 
trances, but one which will  allow you to move, walk, talk and look 
normal to the outside world even though the inside, you’re just like 
“wow, I’m floating”.  
 
Because when I do Conversational Hypnosis, honestly I go very 
strange places.  It’s true, sometimes I don’t even know where I’ve 
gone, all I know is that I’m saying exactly the right thing, right now 
and it helps me. Because if I start over thinking things – I’m really 
not that smart, honestly, and if I try and figure out what’s really 
going on, then I invariably stuff it all up. So I need to be able to, 
really, the harder the situation, the tougher it is, the bigger the 
problem or more resistance I’m getting or whatever it is, the less I 
need to be thinking and the more focused I have to be, I guess 
there’s a special trance there that I’ve evolved over the years and 
that sees me through, and right after we finished over here you’ll 
be doing it too.  
Anthony: 
I mean; I don’t want to add too many layers too soon.  I know 
there’s a lot more to come, but another thing for me, even though I 
just mentioned this to Igor, even watching you practicing this, is the 
person who’s on the receiving end of it, because they know that 
they’re going to be doing it, or maybe just because it’s working, is 
certainly giving the appearance that they’re very actively listening 
at the moment.  If you could look, if you could see the film you’d 
see that you’ve got two people that are locked on. You’d see the 
hypnotist is now locked on and engaging and they’re very 
attentively listening.  They’re already very focused, they’ve got a 
narrow gauge of attention.

Now when I do this stuff, a huge amount of the content that I’m 
going to use is based on what’s standing right in front of me or 
what’s the immediate environment.  We haven’t really; some of 
you are already using it. Some of you are already using sounds and 
conversation that kind of stuff.  For me that’s where most of my 
content comes from.  So again to do that and to maintain literally a 
continuous flow of this kind of talk, it’s inevitable again, that I’m 
going to kind of narrow my own focus. Because while I do it I just 
look at the person’s kind of core, again that kind of looking through 
them situation, and what’s sitting in front on me, feet on the floor, 
person on the chair, sound of the fan, feeling sensations, 
temperatures, outside sounds.  They’re going to be one-half of 
these constructs of the sentence.   
So it’s entrancing in itself to be honest, because if you are the 
practitioner of this, you’ll be becoming more focused.  It’s almost 
like the people that do that, you’re putting that much effort into a 
conversation and you’re recalling the stuff about people in 
psychology and experts and things you’ve learned or the story 
you’ve read or whatever it is.  Your listener really has to invest.  
They can’t kind of flippantly look around if you’re making the effort 
to tell them a story. So the more engage you are, the more likely 
they’re just going to mirror what you’re doing.  I don’t mean that in 
a sense of constant body language mirroring, matching, crossing 
your legs, scratching your ears, pulling your earlobes.  I just mean 
become hypnotized yourself.   
Become hypnotized to the point where you’re still empty, focused 
and they have become your feed, this loop is all set-up.  All you’re 
doing is giving back to them what’s already there and an ambiguous 
nudge toward where you want them to be.  That’s what all these 
sentences and phrases do for me.  It’s just this is where it’s at, this 
is a statement of fact, this is true.  You can be aware of this, you can 
begin to notice that.  You can become aware of this, which is just 
normally just outside your conscious awareness and I’m not going 
to say that, and you can begin to notice that.   
So it’s either a statement of fact based on what I know they can 
observe in the external environment. Or it’s a statement of fact 
based on what I know they’ll be able to observe if they have a little 
look inside and then taking either of those and linking them to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
339 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
where I want them to be, relaxed, focused, listening, feeling.  So 
again I hope I’m not kind of complicating things, it’s just that, that’s 
where my content comes from, that’s why I kind of get hypnotized 
when I’m doing this.  It’s just easier. 
Igor: 
And rest assured we’ll be going more down that road, we’ll start 
pulling the pieces together. It’s just a lot of pieces in the 
Conversational Hypnosis puzzle because to be covert, you have to 
have that extra little layer of sophistication.  You can’t be as direct 
about things and that’s fine.  Sophistication in Street Hypnosis is 
understanding what you’re doing, and why certain things are sent 
in certain directions and so on, you can be very direct about it.   
 
The pressure comes from a different direction, because you’ve 
been being direct about it and they have to solve different 
problems.  In Conversational Hypnosis some of those problems 
don’t arise because there is not the same pressure going on. But 
then the pressure comes from the inside more because it’s more of 
the little bits in the machine to make it work.  So it’s just a trade off 
of what level of indirectional covertness you end up working with.  
And rest assured that’s what we’re getting that way.  I mean, let’s 
go this way.  Was the exercise you did a moment ago, was that easy 
to do?  Did you enjoy it, right?  So it will be as easy as that, provided 
you do as little thinking as you did them.  Is that okay with you 
guys?  Think less, do more, right?  
Audience Member: Yes.  
Igor:  
Works well in a school doesn’t it?  Stop thinking! Any other 
question – that was a great question by the way, so any other 
questions or comments?   
Audience Member: I’ve got a basic question and I simply want to know in which way 
this covert stuff you are now doing, how it relates to what you’ve 
done in the past two days.   
Igor:  
Excellent question. So how does it relate to the past few days?  
Right now it does not because we’re going to put on another set of 
legs.  Think of it this way, the last few days we’ve been running to 
learn to ride a bicycle, right?  You know how to ride a bicycle.  I am 
now giving you a new bicycle except that we have to put it together 
first.  We’re putting the wheels and the bits in place, so it doesn’t 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
340 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
make sense yet because we haven’t assembled the bicycle yet.  
Once it’s put together, which will be this afternoon, after lunch 
break, you’ll ride a bicycle exactly the same way as you did 
yesterday.  We’re basically giving gifts, it’s just a slightly different 
bicycle, right?  The gears are a little different, the legs are a little 
different.  So we have to assemble it first before we can get on our 
way, make sense?   
Audience Member: We’re not riding two bicycles at the same time.  
Igor:  
No, no, no.  I would hope you will not be riding two bicycles at the 
same time.  That could be a little bit painful especially when you go 
in different directions. We will create the conversion points after 
lunch break.   
Anthony: 
Yeah, I mean one thought on that and when we’re doing the more 
direct stuff, we’re doing this covertly. Great. We’ve spoken about 
just giving people gifts, just doing in it to be a force for good.  But 
let’s face it the vast majority of the time people do covert street 
hypnosis, it’s because they want to perform or they got a hobby 
and they just need to express it, because it’s fun or they’re trying to 
win some business.   
 
There’s normally a motivational force there that is generally related 
and you’d being covert about it and you trying to win something 
whether its five minutes of attention or a gig, okay.  With this stuff 
for me, a decent enough starting point is just to think well I want to 
have more influence over people, not as in controlling them, but as 
I go about my life in the world doing my joke, get on the bus, I want 
the kind of be emanating this good force of influence. 
 
I want to be having fun with it but not thinking, I need an audience, 
I need my friends to know what I just did there or look at this 
conversation I had.  It’s just a case if I can be a more effective 
communicator, if my friends and the family and the strangers and 
the colleagues and the customers I have, then my life can be richer.  
I’m not looking for any pay off other than I enjoy this stuff and I 
want to be at – I want to be able to do it openly, I want to be able 
to do it covertly and I want to be everywhere  in between those two 
points and I want to tie the two together.  So one reason just to do 
it because you know you can.   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
341 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
It doesn’t have to be a fail.  You can appear to have a conversation 
with someone you know or someone you don’t know, someone you 
love or someone you only just met and you can have an impact on 
that person. Even if it’s just how you grab their attention and made 
them focus and forget five minutes.  You don’t have to leave 
thinking, why am I feeling elated, why do I now have a belief I can 
do this?  It can literally just be to become a better person, manager 
of people, someone whose life is richer because they know how to 
communicate.  They are aware of the language they’re using.  
Igor:  
Let me put it another way, a metaphor that might help and hope 
it’ll help all you guys, let’s imagine that you had a magic power, like 
an energy that comes out of your hand. All you do is touch 
someone and you transform a bad day into a great day.  You turn 
someone who’s miserable into happy, someone who’s unlucky into 
having the greatest fortune of their life, someone who is just been 
dumped into finding a perfect relationship.   
 
And all you have to do is touch someone, you don’t even have to 
know him. You can bump into them in the tube and just do that and 
you know, you’ve given that person a great gift.  How many of you 
would do it?  How many of you would go around and touch people 
in the shoulder like that?  Why?  I don’t need a verbal answer from 
you guys but whatever you answering right now, that to me is what 
covert street hypnosis is all about.  Covert street hypnosis lets you 
do this, with strangers, with friends, with family, with anyone you 
meet.  It takes a little bit more than simple reaching out and 
touching them with a hand but really it’s exactly the same 
intention, is driven by the exact the same ideas.  And mostly the 
results will be pretty much the same thing too.   
 
Does that make sense to you guys?  That’s kind of where we’re 
heading with this.   For me the reason, the company, our company 
is called Street Hypnosis is because I honestly believe that hypnosis 
is a force for good and it belongs everywhere in people’s lives, 
every part of it.  So if it’s on the street, on the plane, on the train, 
on the bus, on the car and at home, from the TV, everywhere you 
go, everywhere there’s human beings, I think it belongs and it can 
be a tremendous force for good.  So when teaching street hypnosis, 
I want to make sure that we eventually -- the idea of giving gifts, 
which means tremendous things, a great performance, it’s 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
342 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
invigorating, it’s fun.  But I’d like to at least see that inspire you guys 
to go that little step further and give people that extra touch.  
Because you can, you have those skills so you might as well just 
refine them to be able to do this anytime you want too.   
Anthony:  
And the other pay off for this, and I actually said this about my work 
right at the beginning of the course,  I said when people watch what 
I do, they generally think of me as a very direct hypnotist and I said 
my rule into this kind of stuff was, it was being able to continuously 
speak to my clients in this way for good 45 minutes – 60 minutes 
and I can quite happily do that, right?   
 
But I said what people often miss is that I actually use lots of 
indirect ambiguous phrasing when I’m being direct.  So if I’m trying 
to get hand levitation out of somebody, the fact that I know I could 
spent an hour but I could spent ten minutes quite happily trying to 
get one of their fingers to twitch by two millimeters.  I wouldn’t feel 
pressured about that, I just continue to talk, continue to layer ideas 
in exactly the way you’ve been doing it in the last two hours.  
Eventually that will happen and I’ll then if I’m covertly hypnotizing 
people, I will become more direct again because it’s just easier that 
way.   
 
So what you’re going to get from this hopefully is some linguistic 
flexibility.  So when you’re being direct and you’re going to try to do 
-- pull something off in two seconds that means it becomes 20 
seconds, it’s very easy because you got phrases like, as you, which 
means, as you know, you can be aware and when and whatever.  If 
you do in what would normally take you a minute and you need to 
spend 10 minutes doing it, when you can not only get to that same 
point but in that 10 minutes the content of what you’re saying is 
also going to happen effect.  
 
I do a lot of my therapy to work in what appears to be the 
induction. In terms of those big suggestions for, you know, causing 
this dissociation with their perceived conscious mind, opening up 
their unconscious, opening up their creativity, letting them know 
they’re a good human being, letting them know they’re doing well 
and they’ve got the resources they need.  You don’t really have to 
say any of that directly.  And it will sounds a bit like when you’re 
suffering and you’re riddled with anxiety, it all sounds kind of 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
343 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
absurd anyway, if someone saying that directly.  You’re getting out 
of rapport with that person. 
 
So for me, even if you don’t plan to just walk around being a covert, 
shoulder touching superhero, right, which is great because it takes 
your ego out of the equation.  I’m specifically talking about your 
ego, but just be the ego and even if you’re not going to do that, 
practice these patterns, get use to speaking in this way to the point 
when you literally could just rumble on and on with ands and 
wherever and as and which means.  I don’t really have a great deal 
more patterns than the stuff you’ve learn this morning. 
 
I don’t need any more, you know.  It’s fascinating to read about 
them and build the odd one in if it’s a very clever piece of phrasing.  
But generally, in fact I think generally I used less than you’ve 
already learn in the last couple of hours.  But I can give honestly, I 
can give a continuous stream of hypno-babble based on these  
principles.  And when I want to become more direct, I can.  So get 
use to the pay off being flexibility and everything else you’ve learn.   
Igor:  
Did it answer your question?  
Audience Member: Yes, definitely.   
Igor: 
Thank you.  There’s another hand over here somewhere, well that 
seems gone down.  Anyone else want to make a comment or ask 
questions about what we would be doing so far, no?  All right.  
Anthony:  
Is everyone getting the point of doing it?   
Igor: 
Is the stuff being use of you guys so far?  Right, is it interesting?  Are 
you enjoying this work?   
 
H+ 
 
Igor: 
What I want to do now is focus on a slightly different part of our 
metaphorical bicycle, so we’re starting to build up some other skills, 
which we will start putting together.  That’s really going to address 
Robin’s point over here which is, he knows, like you may noticed in 
the first time, you may take a lot of time getting the H+ intensely of 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
344 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
positive. Those of you who have been doing it on the streets have 
notice there’s a big difference between approaching someone we 
are part of the same mind set and them opening up and a person 
who’s like ‘tense’ --  
Anthony:  
Stay away.   
Igor: 
With more negative mind set, there is a huge difference on how 
people response to you, isn’t there?  Would that be fair to say?  
Yes, this is no, this is ‘ohhhh’ It would be a huge difference 
depending on your mind set on how you approach people. Right?  
In conversation the same as true and what Robin was referring to 
here really, is the idea that I will call ‘going first’ and I think it’s been 
a term with me for some time now.  And this is an idea where 
you’re in trance, when you’re in a pleasant comfortable trance, 
you’re kind of like one of these electro magnets, that induces the 
same kind of current into someone else.  They read those signals off 
you.  
 
One way to describe this would be this, when I was young my 
parents had a lot of dinner parties, people would come over and 
eat, serve drinks and be all polite and say, “Oh, look at you, what a 
cute young man.” And I found the really weird thing would occur 
and I felt a little schizophrenic for a while, it took me years to know 
what was going on.  You see with some people I’ve made small talk 
and I hated that, it’s like pulling teeth, like, AGHHH.  So what’s your 
name?  Where you come from?  What do you do for fun?  Oh, I got 
to go and get a drink for someone. Right?   
 
It will be really awkward, with other people I would be going like 
this, about that, come up with some clever philosophical bull about 
life and I’d go, “I’m good.”  And then five minutes later I’m like, “So 
what’s your name again? “   
I had no idea, what’s going on right?  How could I be this 
schizophrenic person that is really charming and sociable one 
minute and then literally the next minute I’m just totally hemming 
and hawing.  And it occurred to me, many years later by way, that 
the difference was not me.  It was the person I was talking to.  You 
see the people I was talking to who are really nervous, who are 
really shy, who were all kind of internally locked up, that was 
affecting me in the same way.

If the people that were chatty and relax and comfortable, made me 
feel comfortable, made me feel chatty and so that’s how I became.  
Does that kind of make sense?  To a greater or lesser extent 
everyone you meet will be that way.  And I say to a greater or lesser 
extent because some people, everyone has their own internal 
boundaries that will end up coming up against but for most people 
it’s relatively easy to get through very, very, very deep, profound 
place very quickly and they would not mind it.  To do that, you need 
to do what we are about to talk about which is develop the trance 
inside yourself which is a functioning trance, in other words, one in 
which you can just go like “Wow, you know what? Come back in an 
hour, I having a good time here.”  (Laughing in the background) 
Don’t make me laugh at Conversational Hypnosis. 
Let me teach you Conversational Hypnosis my favorite way.  Good 
isn’t it? Right?  That’s kind of trance we want to developed. We 
want to develop one, where you are talking, where you are 
interacting, where you are having a conversation and so on.  So to 
start that, ironically, we’re going to take words away to the greater 
extent.  We’re going to do three things and in the finer part of a 
moment, three very simple things, all of which you’ve done to some 
degree already in the last two and a half days, and not really 
realizing it.    
 
The first thing I want you do is go inside and access some kind of 
pleasant trance experience.  So talk about something which is you 
know is about comfort, relaxation and preferable something where 
you had positive feelings toward someone else, for example, a love 
or a talk.   That kind of love we found in day one, only this time you 
can feel free to just close your eyes for a minute or so and really 
feel it.  Remember the best trances that you had over the last few 
days.  Think about people you connected to here or people that 
you’ve connected in your whole life.  When you feel that, you’ll 
notice, you may notice I have a little smile on my face, my eyes get 
a little crinkle, I can’t help it.  This is what happens when I start 
doing hypnosis, if I didn’t do this I’m a really bad hypnotist.   
 
It’s true, I don’t know what to say, the state has all my abilities build 
into.  When I’m out of that state I am very bad at hypnosis.  I’m 
sorry it’s just the way it is.  But the good news is I know how to get 
into that state relatively easily and usually just looking for someone 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
346 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
for long enough would trigger it so the very situation I need to use 
it in is the one that will trigger it for me, which is kind of nice, right?  
So the second step then is you’re going to make eye contact with 
someone in that state and you’re going to keep that eye contact 
whilst you’re feeling all those good feelings.  Your purpose right 
now is just to feel great whilst making eye contact and not breaking 
it.   
 
Now, some of you want to do things like –  Right?  Those are natural 
defense mechanisms that may come up. If it happens just ignore 
them. Allow them to play they’re course, just go back to feeling 
good and looking.  So far are these two simple steps easy to do? 
Yes?   
 
Maybe they see something; maybe they do something or maybe 
just get a feeling that something’s happened that makes them just a 
little bit more hypnotic than before.  Does that make sense?  When 
that happens and you just go, that’s right.   
Anthony:  
So can you still think of that in terms of their level of attention?   
Igor: 
Yeah, even in the term of attention. Remember the one to ten thing 
that we had before, right?  Where’s the level of attention? Where’s 
it now? Where’s it now? Well, if it goes up a notch, you go that’s 
right.  But it doesn’t have to be that.  For example, is breathing my 
shift, that’s right.  Or his finger twitching might take on a rhythm, 
that’s right.  Or you might have an emotion, that’s right.  Or his 
blinking might change, that’s right.   
 
And your job is just to feel good and say, that’s right.  And 
sometimes you might just say “That’s right” because you feel like it 
and you don’t even know why.  Because it feels good to say it, so 
say it anyway, does that make sense?  And I apologize for the tricky 
linguistics. Can you all just practice with me for just a minute to 
make sure we’ve got that complex line pattern down?  That’s right?  
Audience Members: That’s right.  
Igor: 
These guys are good.   
Anthony: 
And I can tell you it does look like mind to mind trance to the 
outside observer.  Because you just did what the most powerful 
fictional hypnotist on the earth can do.  Look at someone back, out 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

they go. Right?  And as you said it, the words, “That’s right” even 
became superfluous to this.  Often I demonstrate the “That’s right” 
induction in my course and I don’t get to the “that’s right”.  And it 
did happened accidentally, you’re trying to demonstrate something 
you have to say and it was just looking, looking, looking, nodding, 
acknowledging, oh, they’re gone.   
 
And like you said, that is what real rapport is to me, rapport is not 
like ability.  Rapport is, absolutely, if you have one-to-one 
connection.  I could see it and you both went there and it was the 
same when Ben was working with you again.  Even though he 
stopped speaking, he was still nodding and acknowledging and the 
feeling that just upon itself -- when I’m saying, that’s right with 
blinking, it’s not just a mirror or match, I want that – when I say, 
“that’s right” I want it to feel like the same deep, genuine level of 
acknowledgement as if we’re having a conversation about 
something else and we just reached a point of understanding.  And 
so he’s talking about a problem, suddenly the thing that is the 
problem would have been aired.  And if at that point you would just 
say, that’s right.   
Igor:  
Yeah.     
Anthony:  
That’s it or you’re looking back and you know – 
Igor:  
That’s it, you got it.  
Anthony: 
Just like that’s it, you mean it and you feel a chill go through you as 
you realize you’re on the same page now.  So when I’m saying 
“That’s right” it’s not just that’s right, that’s right, there’s another 
one, there’s another one. I want to feel and mean that I just 
genuinely seen deeper in you that hypnotic response.  
Igor:  
Right.  
Anthony: 
That’s right.  I am genuinely pacing it.   
Igor:  
There’s something else Anthony just said there which I think is 
important to pull out and hope some of you guys noticed as well.  
“That’s right” does not actually require words, if I’m doing the 
whole exercise here again,  
 
You see that is.  But you see, this is not again, mind-to-mind 
transfer, I haven’t got some special power; it’s got nothing to do 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
348 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
with that.  I’m using my head nod now, as a ‘that’s right’.  Is that 
going to work in the conversation?  Yes and no, again it depends on 
the level of rapport you have in the conversation.  It’s – and think of 
it this way, if I took a pencil and snapped it, that’s pretty easy to do, 
isn’t it?  Taking two gets harder, three gets harder still, each layer of 
pencil being added makes it stronger and tougher.   
 
The point where we can have a whole bridge and drive a truck over 
it and it will be fine, right?  That’s how I look at Conversational 
Hypnosis, each of these little elements are little pencils that you’re 
putting in.  On their own they can be delicate, they can be broken.  
When you layer enough of these things together it becomes a 
bridge that it’s irresistible.  It can take a huge load, does that make 
sense?   
Audience Member:  And I also found that the words “That’s right” was too much, in 
other words I found that a gentle nod, once we got real deep, a 
gentle nod or even the tiniest smile – 
Igor:  
Yes.  
Audience Member:  Was the appropriate response and that “That’s right” was way too 
big.  
Anthony:  
You’ve got that’s right, you got that’s it, you got yeah, you got even 
a smile; that could be a breath as well.  If you were in a normal 
conversation – let’s say it’s sensitive and it’s important to you that 
this person grasps your point of view, but you’re slightly nervous 
they aren’t going to – whatever.  But when you have the 
conversation and you start to put your side of the story to them and 
they just sat there nodding and you realize they were deeply 
acknowledging that, and they absolutely understood what the 
reality of the situation is, without saying a word because they’re 
genuinely nodding.  I mean just to reference a movie, I can’t 
remember the title of it now, but Robert De Niro plays a priest, 
these four young boys that have been through a lot of trauma, 
they’ve been abused and as adults.  
There’s the moment in this movie, and I know he’s an incredible 
actor, there’s a moment in this film where the kids tell the horrific 
story about what they’ve been through in graphic detail.  And they 
focus for about a minute maybe more just on an extreme close-up 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
349 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
of Di Niro’s face. You can’t even hear anything other than a 
mumble, you know that he’s being told this story, but not hearing 
the content.  And over the course of that minute his face goes 
through 30, 40 micro expressions and many of them are, that it’s a 
little release of breath that shows acknowledgement – it’s a nod of 
the head, it’s a slight twist in a muscle that shows he’s feeling some 
tension but again I’m not suggesting that we can all act like that.  
If you are – we all do this stuff naturally when we’re genuinely 
acknowledging, I’m with you on that – I’m connected with you.  We 
don’t have to say it – you nod like you mean it.  
 
Igor: 
Hence we have the whole H+ concept because that creates those 
signals automatically.  The reason that Anthony gets the amazing 
effects on the streets, that some of you guys got these amazing 
effects on the streets, and some people didn’t get quite as amazing, 
is precisely what Alex just said – it can be as simple as the twitch of 
a mouth.  The tiny little curve of the mouth at the right time, just 
say it was “oh!” and this carries on.  At the wrong time or the 
absence of it at the right time, it’s just like “ah!” – it’s going to be a 
bit plainer.  That’s why confidence works, it’s not a mind to mind 
transfer thing, I wish it were, and maybe if it was and I don’t know if 
it is, but I know at least one level  it works, that’s what I called sub-
communication. 
 
It’s this tiniest of movements that the other mind picks up on and 
goes got it.  Now, especially when you have what’s called hypnotic 
rapport, which is what you guys were having, you become 
particularly sensitive to that.  So the deeper that trance goes the 
more sensitive people are.  The less a trance is, they’ll still notice, 
their conscious mind is still aware of it.  But the effect would be a 
little different because you have social contracts around it and so 
on.  Let’s get back to Paul because he’s been waiting. 
 
Audience Member: So this is actually the opposite side of that because Martin was my 
hypnotist and he was doing a combination of both of those and I 
found as we – were in it for several minutes that when he would do 
the nod or do the smile it was like just a little thing firing off – 
almost as thought my unconscious mind is saying “oh good I got it 
right, I got it right!” and it felt really good and ‘that’s right’ felt good 
as well, but because we were like so deep and into it like, having to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
350 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
hear the words was like a process and then those little things.  
Yeah.  So I mean reaffirming everything that you guys were saying 
just from the other side of the conversation. 
 
Igor: 
Now I’m really glad that – would it be fair to say that most of you 
had a similar experience it might not be identical, but it goes in that 
direction.  Wouldn’t that be fair to say guys – yes, no, maybe so?  
 
 
 
Conversational Hypnosis 
 
Igor: 
 This is important because we’re now getting into how to do the 
Conversational Hypnosis and when I used to teach Conversational 
Hypnosis, I used to focus on the language and all the clever frames 
and things you put in.  In can work great, but then I see my 
students, this is typical working in the corporations, and I had one-
on-one with executives.  I’d see them do it and I’d go “Ah, you miss 
the point!” and the reason I came to realize this, that people get so 
hang up about the language, they miss this – that feeling that vibe 
you just were creating, right? 
 
You never sacrifice the vibe for the language.  So we’re going to do 
this exercise again in a moment, exactly the same thing, close your 
eyes, open you’re your eyes, smile, nod – that’s right, that’s right 
and so on, right?  Now, I’d like to advise you, by way he didn’t 
spend the whole five minutes, I want you to keep going for the full 
time, don’t break it half way through.  It’ll make more sense when 
we start introducing the next phase in a minute.    
 
Anthony: 
Let me just say, because a few of you were rubbing your eyes and if 
you don’t want an eye strain then make sure it’s not staring 
contest, you look through the head. 
 
 
Igor: 
It just clicks in the minute you get eye contact – I mean that’s right, 
that’s right.  And at some point you’ll feel something has clicked.  
You probably sensed a shift has happened relatively quickly, that 
would be fair?  Just by our interaction, the nature of it.  When you 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
351 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
feel that sort of shift happening – that’s right.  I just had it there?  
What would you do is now it to start introducing the previous 
exercise, remember when we talked about human beings and 
comfort and relaxation as part of that.  Remember that exercise? 
 
 
You’re going to do exactly the same thing, but you’re introducing it 
only a slowly as it does not break up this, does that make sense?  
That means you may only be able to introduce one word at a time 
and that’s fine.  Again, I’m not looking for sense or logical or 
anything like that – I’m looking for the words fitting around the vibe 
rather than violating it.  Does that make sense to you guys a little 
bit in terms of what we’re doing so far?  This is yes – this is no – all 
right you completely lost in different place? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah.  
 
Igor: 
Let me get you a quick illustration of what I mean and then it might 
make sense.  I’ll do it wrong first, is that okay with you guys?  
 
Audience Member:  Yeah. 
 
Igor:  
I’ll start off right and then I’ll do it wrong.  That’s right, that’s right, 
because people can relax.  Did you feel that?  Did you feel the 
sudden shift, right? That’s popped him right out. It’s a violation of 
the ambiance we were creating, isn’t it?  That’s because I was so 
focused on my language I broke the actual context, did you notice, 
did you get sense of that, right?  Let’s see if I can do it right.   
 
 
That’s right.  There you go.  ‘Cause people are fascinating, don’t you 
think?  They can relax, all kinds of ways – a mountain climber, that’s 
right?  Can be straining his body, and relax.  Perhaps it’s a relaxed 
mind – that’s the most important of all.  That’s right. 
 
I really don’t know, what makes people, relax and feel good.  It does 
happen, doesn’t it?  Yeah.  Did I violate that vibe there?  No. And it 
was clear ending to my whole thing.  You know the slight shift, up 
gear a little bit.  We started bringing him back out again.  And 
whenever you’re ready, come back to full waking consciousness 
again – just enjoy the ride!

Anthony: 
The only other little tip I’d give on this not violating the vibe – just 
got to be the name of The Eagles first pop album.   
 
Igor: 
I don’t violate all.   
 
Anthony:    
Again this kind of ties into what I said about pacing and leading and 
how most of my content comes from what’s in front of me.  Easiest 
place for me to start – if we’re in that situation would be the “as” 
statement. Now, as you she there, now as you look at me, or as 
people look at each other, just to stay. Yes, it’s your tone and the 
pace and use their breathing, Igor was making his statements there 
as I was exhaling, at least that’s how it seemed, it certainly was 
some timing being driven by me, ridden out by him.  So in the 
absence of  any other ideas for now, keep to the statement you’ve, 
got but just keep it factual, just make the first thing a statement of 
fact.   
 
It’s very, very difficult to resist something when you know it’s 
absolutely true.  So it’s just, you know, as we sit here, or as we sit 
here, you can know, I’m sure you know that people blah, blah, blah 
get into your vehicle again – get into that vehicle – ride it for as long 
as you can.  If you feel that you know, even as that’s going on – you 
will understand this is not stable – they are going to be riding up 
and down in this, okay?  Just go with it, just acknowledge it again.  
Start to drift back up as I did there.  My eyes were closed, I don’t 
know how long for, five seconds, ten seconds and – its – I didn’t 
want to go further into that, but I could feel my eyes wanting to 
close.  I’m not going to not open them, but did he panic “oh! I’ve 
lost it, it’s broken – I’ve violated the vibe?”.  No, he just continued, 
he just plowed on, can’t you? 
 
Igor: 
Oh! Getting cozy now I think that’s a sign, don’t you?  
 
Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
A sign to do some hypnosis.  So does everyone understand the 
exercise that we’ve just been talking about?  Yes?   It’s really just 
combining all the things that we’ve been doing today.  We’re going 
to start off with yourself; you’ll next go into an eye locking gaze, in a 
friendly way of course.  And just acknowledge things, that’s right, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
353 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
that’s right, that’s right, and when you get to the right point, that’s 
right.  We’ll just start talking about people and relaxing and feeling 
comfort, people relax all the time.  
 
 
People feel comfort, all the time, which means, and notice, I’m not 
rushing the words, right?  If I were to rush the words and say 
people can relax all the time and they really can enjoy the 
experience.  You notice how I’m forcing a different rhythm into the 
interaction now, I don’t want that. I want to capture whatever 
rhythm’s been created and just slowly ride that in.  If it comes back 
up, no big deal I just keep riding it through.  You get a sense on 
what I’m talking about with this? You all have a clear idea of what 
the exercise is? 
 
Audience Member: Try, yes. 
 
Igor: 
Yes? 
 
Anthony: 
I was just going to say.  Don’t start speaking until you feel a hint of 
that connection.  Even if it’s tiny, you just think, even wonder, 
wonder if I got it now, then have a go.   
 
Igor: 
Exactly. You can always stop and go back to that’s right for while if 
you feel that you’ve lost it, all right?  So find a partner – different 
partner this time and please make sure you’ll be there for the full 
five minutes doing this.   
 
 
Q&A Session 
 
Igor:  
How did you guys enjoy that? Pretty good?  
 
Audience Member: Yeah. (applause) 
 
Igor: 
Yeah, may as well do that.  You deserve it, right?  You, believe it or 
not, have just done your first solo piece of Conversational Hypnosis 
and it’s very natural, right?  Couple of things that I want to point 
out here, then we’ll open up for questions and answer them in a 
moment if you need too.  The thing that I want to point out here is 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
354 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
this is not how you’ll usually be doing Conversational Hypnosis, this 
is much more intimate, it’s much more intense, shall we say, than a 
normal conversation will allow for, especially with a stranger, right?  
Can you imagine meeting someone for five minutes and go “people 
can relax”, right? Trust me I have done it and the results aren’t very 
good, why? Because I’m violating a social contract.  
 
It’s a different context and you have to fit within that and basically 
after lunch break,  what we’ll do, we’ll start using this basic vehicle 
and shape it into a round shape for the round hole, a square shape, 
for the square hole and so on.  So it fits the different context and 
you can use it in a practical way, which is usually covert, rather 
than, there has to be a way you just keep looking at me and come 
closer and closer, I was going to kiss him, ug.  We don’t need that 
kind of thing, what’s important to me right now is you realize first 
of all – the language, is that pretty easy – that kind of flows 
naturally; would that be fair to say?  The vibe, you know when it’s 
there and you know when you’ve broken it, right?  Would that be 
fair to say? 
 
And the language can be the very thing that breaks the vibe if you 
introduce it at the wrong rhythm.  Would that be fair to say?  By the 
wrong pace, the wrong speed, the wrong volume and that sort of 
stuff.  When you have all those things together, it’s just like a 
wonderful ride.  If some of these things are missing – you can 
create a bump in the road which pops you right back up again.  
Does that make sense to you guys?  Is that fair comment?  So, 
anything you want to add to that? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. We’ll probably cover it at some point after lunch.  But just a 
couple of things – yes, we’re spending five minutes on this exercise, 
what we can take from this is when you are just in a conversation, 
you haven’t got a little covert mission to hypnotize someone or 
influence them.  But you have a conversation with purpose; if at 
some point in that conversation you instinctively feel you’ve got 
that connection, then that’s when want to be making your point – 
that’s when you want to be reaching forward and giving your 
suggestion.  It’s not – it doesn’t have to turn into a 20 minute piece, 
this can be three and four seconds snatches of your day or the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
355 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
meeting or the interview, when there’s a laugh, there’s a touch, 
there’s a connection.  
 
The moment you feel that, it’s the same thing you were feeling 
here, when you started to speak.  The other thing I whispered in a 
few people’s ears here, because obviously you get more effective at 
this, and a good half dozen of you at least completely put the 
person out, eyes shut, down in hypnosis. And I crept up behind a 
few people and I said, I want you to carry on talking but I want you 
to bring them back up to a certain point and then I want you to talk 
them back down again.  Purely because you demonstrated that you 
can get the person into a trance by just staring at them and pacing 
them, right?   So if you’ve already got that – yeah, it feels good to 
carry on hypnotizing them for five minutes, making them feel good 
but you’re no longer testing yourself at that point. 
 
So you might as well demonstrate that you really are in control of 
this – by maintaining that the same vibe, the same pace but then 
just beginning to pick you up, beginning to make your statements 
about awareness, about eyes opening and looking up and that’s 
right.  That’s right.  And just get back into it again and just push 
them straight back down that rabbit hole again.  Just for you to 
demonstrate – yep!  I am in control of this so I can manage their 
attention levels, I can raise their levels of awareness, I can narrow 
their field of attention, narrow their focus and you can do all 
conversationally in fact, most of these things, you already do it.  
You already do it in normal conversation with people.   
 
Igor: 
You just don’t realize it yet, right? 
 
Anthony: 
Yeah. 
 
 
Igor: 
All right guys.  So let’s welcome the floor open to questions if you 
have any before we go to lunch – or comments if you enjoyed the 
exercise or something interesting happen to you, I’m happy to take 
those things as well. 
 
Audience Member: It just comes to my mind.  Ben was asking about connection with 
what we did previously – so basically, I have an idea probably this 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
356 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
that possibly – we can possibly use this when we use blessing at the 
end of the rest of the session. 
 
 
Igor: 
Yeah! 
 
Audience Member: So, we can do that by telling the kind of story of relaxation.  
 
Igor: 
Good point.  We’ll come onto the full kind of structure for the 
hypnotic gift, the covert gift, after lunch but you’re heading in 
exactly the right direction, that’s exactly right.  You can do this 
overly and covertly – the point is you have a choice, right?  
Wherever you fit in you, have a choice to do it, any other comments 
or questions?  All righty.  Say again let’s put this on here. 
 
Audience Member: I’m feeling pretty tired today.  I kind of, when I was in the trance I 
kind of opened my eyes again so I didn’t go to sleep because I really 
felt I was going to go right out. How do you stop person from going 
to sleep and not just into the trance?  
 
Igor: 
Well, actually that bit’s relatively straight forward.  The two things 
that are going on here for you is number one, the rooms is a bit hot 
and stuffy, so we’re trying to get the air conditioning fixed – it’s a 
contextual thing, you’ve got a hot stuffy room, you get sleepy, 
that’s good.  And the second thing is in normal regular 
conversation, we’re not having regular conversations here, you 
realize that, right? We don’t normally sit with someone and go 
“that’s right”.  It’s an unusual thing, so you’ve been fractionating 
your own trances this morning, so your response potential is a little 
bit stronger than it normally it would be.  You know in regular 
conversation what tends to happens is this, there will be eyes wide 
open and I’ll go, because they don’t want to close their eyes. 
 
Why? Because it’s not part of a conversation – it feels rude to talk 
something like this “yeah just keep talking I am listening”.  Those 
elements will still feed into what’s happening so, you’re bigger issue 
is not going to be whether or not they fall asleep.  The bigger issue 
is whether or not they’ll stay in the level of trance you’ve created 
long enough and we’ll talk about how to find the right level of what 
they’re comfortable at later on.  So, it’s only a symbol or sign that 
you been taken particularly deep and you’re on that threshold 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
357 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
where your unconscious mind wants to take over and actually, you 
might not be that much asleep, it might just be question that you’re 
going to a particular depth, which is fine. 
 
But in regular conversations, it’s unlikely that you’ll be reaching 
those kinds of trances unless you go to a more semi-covert thing, 
where they know something is going on; just don’t know what it is.  
But that’s not the kind of trance we’re talk about now. 
 
Anthony: 
All right. Just to come back to that.  For me this covert bit naturally 
slides towards semi covert because this is just what I do if I’m 
talking to you and I’m going to do my best to communicate as 
effectively as I can.  So, when you’re being semi covert and there is 
a little opportunity for them to just close their eyes and let their 
imagination go off hook a bit, sometimes they will.  If I think that’s 
turned into sleep, then the easiest ways that I know to do it are to 
use their name.  So first off I just use the person’s name, still in the 
same pace, still the same tone, still in the same hypnotic vehicle but 
if I feel you’re falling asleep, I just start to pepper in your name 
every now and again and it tends to pick you up. 
 
If I still you’re falling asleep, I’ll tend to pick up my tempo a little bit, 
just as I was encouraging people to demonstrate they’re in control 
of this. That they haven’t just, you know, accidentally hypnotized 
someone, that they are in control ‘cause they can bring them back 
up again. So I raise my tempo, raise my volume and, you know, 
again, you’re still at the level of semi covert but beyond that, if I 
was getting a little more overt, I’d just stick their hand to their face 
because it’s quite difficult to fall asleep when your hands stuck to 
your head.  But we’re not there yet, but for now I just say if you feel 
that you’re losing control of this and they are now drifting off into 
sleep, demonstrate that you’re back in control, okay?  So just make 
it clear.  
 
 
 
 
I just talk to them, that’s right Alex, even as you feel those good 
feelings, you can open your eyes.  That’s right.  You’ve just got to 
pace and pace and push them back in again. 
 
Igor: 
Basically, all the things that would normally violate that vibe, you 
now do in small doses on purpose to perk them up a little bit. We’ll 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
358 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
come to that after lunch.  I’ll just bring a microphone over there – 
does that help by the way? 
 
Audience Member: Yes it does.   
 
Audience Member:  What I found is a when you’re focusing on the pupil of the eye, it’s 
very easy to get hypnotized yourself.  
 
Igor: 
Um, hm. 
 
Audience Member: So, what – especially on the previous exercise, because when you’re 
talking, you’re kind of brining yourself back to reality. 
 
Igor: 
Exactly! 
 
Audience Member: But when you are sort of focusing or gazing you start drifting 
yourself and as long as you sometimes come back to this conscious 
thought, that I have this intention to hypnotize the person, sort of 
like H+ intention then its fine.  Then – but it’s not bad to actually 
sort of drift off yourself once in a while that actually.  
 
Igor: 
In fact, I would encourage you because you say the magic words 
and once you’re still conversing, it keeps you alert enough with 
what you say that you don’t get too distracted.  But the beauty is 
and this is exactly what I said happens to me, when I start making 
eye contact with people and making that intention of wanting to 
hypnotize, it just does it for me.  Its sucks me into this trance, but I 
can still speak.  At that point, honestly I don’t care, I will go as deep 
as it’ll take me provided I can still function and speak and do my 
thing, I’m good with it, right?  And the interaction is going to 
basically take care of that for you.   
 
Audience Member: Right.  Because when you get hypnotized yourself it’s basically your 
unconscious mind that’s doing the thing for you and that’s what 
you want, right? 
 
Igor: 
That’s exactly what you want. Basically for me it’s a sign that my 
unconscious mind is being more active, it’s taking over some of the 
regular conscious processes, which is what I need, ‘cause honestly 
guys, let me reemphasize this, I cannot do this stuff.  I’m a terrible

hypnotist; I’m really a terrible hypnotist if I’m trying to do it 
consciously – if I’m trying to think of all the cool elements inside 
and so on. The only time it happens is when I get into that zone and 
it happens by itself and all this stuff comes out and you may notice 
a whole bunch of products in the back of the room, the place that 
has come from is me doing something and afterwards thinking 
“what the hell did I just do?”, “oh that’s really good, I’d better to 
take notes on that”. 
 
Seriously it fits the moment, it worked and I wanted to be able to 
do more of it, so now I have to figure out what it was that works, so 
I can do more of it on purpose. But then again,  I wasn’t doing a 
thing like “now I’m going to do this” instead of “oh I recognize this 
same situation again, that means these other skills will fit in too”.  
Does that make sense to you guys?  So your conscious mind is more 
a conductor over the orchestra.  It does not play the instruments, it 
just conducts them.  I don’t play the instruments, I just conduct 
them consciously and then my unconscious mind brings the 
appropriate instruments to bear.    
 
Anthony: 
The other point on this stuff with the eyes.  As a thing, quite often 
in trying to make hypnosis less mystical and understandable, we 
kinda’ scoff and we laugh at eye power techniques, if you like.  And 
you shouldn’t – they’re massively powerful.  If you walked into a 
bar and you pitched up alongside someone at the bar.  And they 
turn around and they had a fixed stare with the tiny little pupils, I 
reckon you’d feel something.  You might not know what their 
intentions are, but I’m pretty certain you’d feel slightly 
uncomfortable.  If a bar maid you saw and she’s smiling and you 
walk up to the bar to get your drink and her pupils were large and 
she’s was locked into you, she’s really listening and conversation 
was natural, I’d expect you’d feel something? Right?  
 
Regardless of whether you’re kind of attracted to her or whatever 
I’m just saying if someone can stay that, with their eyes, even when 
they speak “yes please, what would you like?”, they’re open, I 
reckon you’d respond to that? So you said it’s easy when you’re 
locking onto someone’s eye like that, to find yourself going into 
trance.  What you need to do, is you need to get the understanding 
that you are going to actively aim to do that.  You’re going to aim to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
360 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
put this person into hypnosis by dilating your pupil, by focusing on 
the back of their head rather than on the surface of their eye.   
 
That was my aim earlier, when I did this exercise with both of you.  
Regardless of where it went, my intention was that as you keep 
looking, that some point you’re going to notice that my pupil is 
dilating. As, it’s like any other creature, a hell of a lot of information 
and communication as being done by microscopic eye movements 
and by locking onto someone, by allowing myself to go into a bit of 
a trance state, it’s very likely to make someone else wobble a little 
bit and think I need to pull myself back to the room.  All these 
people are out of it, crazy, that kind of feeling, when you get lots of 
people around you who are massively drunk, or not in the same 
place as you, or take a particular drug and you’re not in the same 
place.  
 
You look around, they think they’re having a decent worthwhile 
conversation, but you can tell they’re just not really engaged, 
they’re just – and all it is, is their eyes, the brightness of them and 
whether they can acknowledge you with a look, at certain points in 
the conversation.  I think we underestimate eye power, and focus 
and just what you can do with a look.  But you shouldn’t just be 
sliding into trance accidentally; you should be aiming to take 
yourself to that state as quickly as possible the moment you’ve 
locked onto their eye. 
 
Igor: 
That’s wonderful you have a vehicle which is very thing that makes 
you want to Conversational Hypnosis with another human being, is 
the very thing that is going to help you trigger it, which is, I think it’s 
a great way to do it.  Any other questions before we go to lunch?  
Or is the lunch bell calling us? All right.

DVD #18 – London – Part 2                             
Creating ‘Hypnotic Magic Moments’, Final 
Demos & Final Thoughts 
 
 
Make Hypnosis Covert 
 
Igor: 
So, before the break, we had a chance to do some pretty trippy 
hypnosis.  Would it be fair to say?  And we started kind of what 
we’re seeing is back to front, but actually is the right way around, 
which we started by creating this strong hypnotic vibe for want of a 
better word.  And then we started layering language on top of that 
to create the effect.  Make sense?  Now the problem is, in a normal 
conversation, it doesn’t work that way.  It works the other way 
around.  Because you know you’re not suddenly going have 
someone come to you and say, “Hey, Anthony, how’s it going?  Are 
you having a great time?”  “Yeah, it’s fantastic,” and, “That’s right, 
that’s right, Anthony, your life is good, it’s good.”   
 
That’d be kind of a slightly, in terms of social moments, that would 
be put in the awkward box, right?  We don’t want the awkward 
box.  We want it to be nice and empty for you guys.  So, we need to 
be able to do that without getting awkward.  And the answer, the 
solution to that basically is you turn the whole process around and 
you’re getting to the point where you could quite happily sit with 
someone and go, “That’s right, that’s right.”  And they wouldn’t 
mind.  And it would seem totally natural to them.  Would you like to 
know how to do that?   
 
Okay.  So what we’re going to do is in a moment we are going to 
break up into pairs and we’ll give you about seven minutes apiece 
so you can have a little bit of a conversation going first. You’ll just 
have a chat.  You’ll identify who’s going to be the hypnotist first.  
You’ll just have a normal chat about stuff, maybe the course, maybe 
the football, life, the universe, whatever.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
362 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Now at some point, what I’m going to ask you to do is when you 
have your normal conversation, you notice that when people have 
conversations they look at each other and they look away, they look 
at each other.  It’s just how normal social contact goes.  At some 
point, as the hypnotist, I want you just to look at their eyes and just 
keep talking normally, but do not look away from that point on.   
 
Now this is not 100 percent how it’s done in the social contexts, but 
it’s about 90-95% of the way there.  And actually, a lot of times this 
alone will do the trick.  All right?  I want you to look and keep 
looking as you talk about the football and this other thing, and so 
on.  Now, your partner will probably still look away and get a little 
uncomfortable and all those sort of things.  And that’s fine.  Step 
two:  Once you have that, once you’ve got the eye contact, as 
you’re doing the eye contact, start feeling it yourself.  You’re not 
doing it yet, you’re still talking about the football, you’re still talking 
about whatever else it is, but you’re going to start feeling 
something hypnotic beginning to occur inside yourself.   
 
Anthony: 
It’s almost like you’re like a sort of pillar, like a lighthouse there.  I 
can look away again, but they’re still solid.  I’m going to think it, but 
it’s like it – 
 
Igor: 
It’s still there.   
 
Anthony: 
It’s still got a solid reference point, so my attention is going to start 
to gravitate to that point again.   
 
Igor: 
I’m starting to feel it, and you may notice.  Tell me when you think 
I’m starting to switch into my hypnotic mode.  You should be able 
to tell very quickly even though I’m going to talk about complete 
inane things.  I’m not going to actually change anything in terms of 
what I say.  I’ll talk about football.  I’ll talk about life.  I’ll talk about 
people.  It really doesn’t matter what I talk about.   
 
Audience Member: That’s really noticeable.   
 
Igor: 
Can you notice this is already happening?  My whole voice, my 
whole process, everything starts to change because it’s being 
switched on from the inside.  Does that make sense?  So once you, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
363 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
as a hypnotist, start to feel that vibe, you maybe hear your own 
language slowing down and stuff like that, I want you to introduce 
your hypnotic vehicle.  In this case, it’s a very simple one.  Its people 
are fascinating, aren’t they?  Now you’re back to where you started 
from, aren’t you?  Right?  You are going to continue that cycle, so 
you’re deepening it as you go along.  So you’re making it stronger 
and stronger for yourself.   
 
And if you’re partner is drooling on the floor by the end of it, fine.  
If they’re just like, “Wow, this guy’s really interesting.  He’s got a 
really cool philosophy about life,” that’s fine too.  I don’t care which 
of the two you have.  The point is you graduate your way in.  Make 
sense?  You’ve had an absolutely normal conversation.  You’ve 
locked eye contact.  You’ve built your H+ in that eye contact.  You, 
as a result, start changing your rhythms.  And then you’ve even 
chosen your vehicle and then people just do become fascinating, 
don’t they?  Right?  Is that easy to do?  Seven minutes apiece.  We’ll 
give you a shout when it’s time to turn around.   
 
Do start the first 30 seconds, minute or so, just normal chit-chat, 
whatever chit-chat you want.  And then switch it on, step by step.  
Eyes, body, voice, vehicle, boom, your in.  Right?  Remember eyes, 
body, vehicle, people are fascinating, trance.  Normal conversation, 
eyes, body, voice, vehicle, trance.  It’s that simple.  Right?  It’s that 
simple.  Everyone good with that? 
 
Audience Member: Yep.   
 
Igor: 
Gotta find a partner and off you go.   
 
 
Demonstration Exercise 
 
Participant 1: 
So, are you enjoying the concept?   
 
Participant 2: 
Yeah, I am.  I’m enjoying it.   
 
Participant 1: 
It’s good though.  You kind of relax and zone out – 
 
Participant 2: 
It makes you ready for going to trance, doesn’t it?   

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Participant 1: 
Yeah, well it kind of makes my job a little bit easier sometimes.   
 
Participant 2: 
Yeah, it does, yeah.   
 
Participant 1: 
What’s your favorite part about it so far? 
 
Participant 2: 
My favorite what? 
 
Participant 1: 
Part about the course so far? 
 
Participant 2: 
I think it was about the structure, which was teaching me the skills, 
starting with the most socially awkward part and then moving into 
the more socially normal part, which kind of makes you okay with 
the plan to get there.   
 
Participant 1: 
And it’s interesting like how any normal conversation can go from – 
because when you’re talking to someone, you’re on the same 
wavelength, right?  You’re listening to them.  If you were to talk to a 
friend and they say, “Stand up, come over here, I’ll be more 
comfortable on this side of the room.”  You’d be all right with that.  
And if they said, ‘Here look, just close your eyes for five seconds.  I 
want to show you something.”  That would be fine because you feel 
comfortable and you’re right to kind of go ahead with anything and 
do whatever you like.  And you’re just feeling good.  It’s the way 
people interact.  It often kind of supersedes the normal boundaries 
of social politeness, doesn’t it?   
 
Because people like other people and we enjoy learning from each 
other.  And we enjoy feeling comfortable, that’s right, with the 
people that we are around.  And you know, you don’t really care, its 
good stuff. It’s as you said, it makes it easier to relax.  So, if you 
know, in a casual conversation, you find yourself, you like to relax 
because people can relax in all sorts of situations.  It’s not that hard 
to do.  And the thing about people, the more you kind of realize 
that there are people around you who are in different situations, 
the more you can discover just how easy it is to go beyond what 
you thought was possible.

You see a stranger in the bar, he’s just another face.  There are six 
billion people in world and five minutes later you can be talking to 
this one person for that time he or she can be a center of your 
reality, totally focused on what’s happening.  It’s as if the rest of us 
seem to seem to fade away and everything kind of narrows down. 
That’s right.  And again, breathe easy and kind of look deeply into 
this other person, into what are they saying.  What’s really going on 
here?  And eventually, it’s like absorbing of self-removal even 
though you know that people are acting or just pretending.  
Suddenly that reality just stops and you’re entirely absolved in 
what’s going on.   
 
You laugh, you cry, you become totally fascinated in what’s 
happened.  It’s like in reality; sometimes you see things that really 
captivate you.  And you know that they really come from true 
meaningful relationships.  That’s right.   
 
I was at an aquarium the other day and I saw a fish just swimming 
around in a bowl.  Just around and around and around.  And it’s 
kind of most hypnotic in a way.  It’s just there.  It’s just comfortable.  
It’s in its own little world that’s sealed and it doesn’t even care 
about what’s happening outside.  It doesn’t know what’s happening 
around it.  Imagine if that bowl was placed by the ocean full of 
other fish, other life, other things for it to discover. And it’s kind of 
like that in this course.  Everyone’s safe in this room feeling warm, 
feeling relaxed, that’s right, feeling comfortable, and to go into 
trance and experience different things.   
 
When we get out in the streets, we go talk to strangers.  There’s a 
whole new world out there, so many more things that we can 
discover.  So this fish just swimming around and around in a bowl, 
it’s comfortable, it’s safe, that’s right.  And maybe it knows that 
there’s somewhere else it needs to go, something more that it 
needs to discover.   
 
So it has the choice of jumping through the air, the cold air, and 
finally arriving in the huge ocean with life being so much richer and 
more powerful than it could possibly imagine, or it can stay inside 
that bowl and go around and around and around.  And sometimes, 
you know, when you consider life like that, you just need to take a 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
366 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
breath in and you let it out.  You stand back from yourself and you 
see the world for what it is and you think hey, I don’t want to stay 
stuck in the fishbowl for all my life.  I just kind of want to step 
outside of it, embrace the entire ocean.   
 
When you come out, that’s right, you get inside. It can bring a real 
sense of peace when you understand just how easy it is to let go, to 
go for it, kind of to seize the life that however you want to 
experience it.  That’s right.  That’s relaxation.  It really can feel good 
to totally focus inside your mind and enjoy the learnings and 
experiences that you can gain there.  So if your eyelids happen to 
flicker and your face color changes and your shoulders relax and 
you get to breathe deeper, in and out, you might be surprised to 
find just how truly relaxed you can be.  And listen to it because the 
more you find yourself searching in life, this one thing, the more 
you realize how easy it is just to leap through the air like that fish 
jumping out of the fish bowl. And arrive in the entire ocean.  To 
look around and see the entire world for what it is and think yes, 
this is where I am and this is the life I want to lead.  That’s right.  
And it feels good and peaceful to know, to truly understand just 
how easy it is to experience this, truly and deeply for yourself, your 
life.  That’s right.   
 
So, as you kind of go inside your own life, you continue to breathe, 
in and out, that’s right.  Just breathe, feeling that flickering of your 
eyes, relaxation of your body and your mind.  And you can take 
these feelings, take them from your eyes and send them all the way 
over your body, all the way through your bones. So it really does 
feel good to sit in the spot, to sit in this area of chaos.  Because you 
know what, once you experience true relaxation, true calm, true 
intent, knowing that you are totally peaceful inside your mind.  That 
you are capable of achieving everything that you want, to be able to 
accomplish it easily.  It really does feel good.  Because like that fish 
swimming around in the fish bowl, it knew there was something out 
there.  And maybe it didn’t know quite what it was, but once you 
discover just how amazing, just how deep, just how rich the wild 
really is, it really can feel good.   
 
So only at your own regular speed, you return to the room now and 
as you return to the here and now, back into reality, back now, 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

awake and alive, feeling fantastic.  See it’s really funny, isn’t it, how 
people’s conversations can go off in all sorts of directions and often 
you learn great things from them.   
 
Participant 2: 
That’s great.  Thank you. 
 
* * * * * * * *  
 
Igor: 
So, let’s just find out first of all the people that find it easy, what 
kind of things did you have?  And then we’ll go onto some 
troubleshooting, all right?   
 
Audience Member: I found it very easy.  We were talking about how we’re going to get 
back to Europe.  And I’m flying and he’s going on the train.  And 
with the flying, he just kept coming in occasionally with a, “Well, 
then you can relax.”  And I found myself drifting, drifting away and 
coming back up, drifting away.   
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Audience Member: And the same thing happened when I did it with him.  Didn’t ya?  
There he is.  I could see, he wouldn’t look at me; he was looking 
over to my right shoulder – 
 
Igor: 
It’s relatively common that that happens, yep. 
 
Audience Member: But then he was looking left, but as I was talking, he was going 
down, down, down, so I brought him back up again, and then we 
went down, and then we brought him up and then you went, 
“That’s it.”  But it was good. 
 
Igor: 
Perfect.  Beautiful. 
 
Audience Member: Really good.   
 
Igor: 
Good job.  We can give him a round of applause for that.  Anyone 
else want to – 
 
Audience Member: I find that this goes best for myself when I become an observer of 
myself, at the same time as the person I’m talking to, so the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
368 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
thoughts and the words that I speak, I’m consciously aware of them 
after they are said, if that makes any sense.  It’s like an unconscious 
flow-state.  So, I’m not even thinking about what I’m saying.  The 
words just come out and I get to learn them and appreciate them as 
its happening.  So it’s about as in the moment as you can get.   
 
Igor: 
Welcome to my world, right?  Yeah, give him a round of applause.  
Just to emphasize, I have no idea what I’m doing up here.  Honestly, 
half the time I’m going, what did we do again?  Oh yeah, well done.  
Do you want to add something?  Or was it someone else?  Okay.   
 
 
Troubleshooting 
 
Igor: 
So, let’s turn our attention a little bit now towards the 
troubleshooting.  Who found that a little bit more challenging?   
 
Audience Member: I wasn’t actually done getting to the point where you simply could 
induce a trance.  I don’t know what happened, but it’s like – 
 
Igor: 
So, did you give the eye contact? 
 
Audience Member: Yes, the whole time. 
 
Igor: 
As the hypnotist?  You locked eye contact?  You didn’t look away, as 
the hypnotist? 
 
Audience Member: I looked away, definitely.   
 
Igor: 
Ahh, you see, that’s the first – remember the first rule was once you 
start the, I’m going to do hypnosis, you lock eyes, you do not look 
away at that point.  You keep your eyes on that person for the rest 
of that session – 
 
Audience Member: I did those later on.   
 
Igor: 
Ahh, and how did that work? 
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Anthony: 
Well, I saw that. And you said what your experience was.  I just 
happened to chance upon you two when you were at that moment 
and yeah, as you said, don’t look away.  But I think if you’ve got to 
that and you’ve attempted to establish that and it’s not working –  
 
Igor: 
There are similar things you can get onto that. 
 
Anthony: 
You can take a small step back, back into conversation.  And then 
try again.  It only has to be 10 or 15 seconds later.   
 
Igor: 
In terms of what you actually experienced, just talk us through what 
you had.  So you made eye contact, you broke it a little bit, that’s 
fine.  You can work with it, but for the purpose of exercise, it makes 
it a little hard on you.  But what else happened then? 
 
Audience Member: And then I wasn’t able to truly introduce, like a hypnotic related 
topics.   
 
Igor: 
Oh, okay.  So, if they’re saying people are fascinating, you didn’t 
find an opportunity to do it, to say that, right?  Well that’s okay.  Let 
me just, in terms of doing this exercise, if you do this again, which I 
encourage you to do by the way when you have break, but that’s 
not the point, at no point did I say you have to make the 
introduction fluid or natural.  You still make a hard break.  We’re 
still not full into the pattern yet.  We’re building up towards that. 
Right?  So, you’re trying to do more than you need to right now be 
basically what you’re saying? 
 
Audience Member: Maybe that’s helping the problem.   
 
Igor: 
Right.  So, let me put it this way.  Had you been able to introduce 
the idea of people are fascinating as the vehicle relatively easily, 
would that have been a lot easier for you to do?  Do you think you 
would have had a better result? 
 
Audience Member: Yes.   
 
Igor: 
Yes?  Probably or maybe? 
 
Audience Member: Maybe.

Igor: 
Not definitely? 
 
Audience Member: Not definitely.   
 
Igor: 
What else is missing then? 
 
Audience Member: I don’t know.  Maybe – 
 
Igor: 
Did you feel it inside yourself? 
 
Audience Member: No.   
 
 
Igor: 
Okay. 
 
Audience Member: I’ve -- during the whole course, I really put my problem to guess 
these friendship feelings, you know? 
 
Igor: 
You don’t even have to have the friendship feeling.  It’s enough that 
you feel the warm glow.  Do you sometimes feel different than you 
do now for example?  Or do you always feel exactly the same? 
 
Audience Member: Exactly the same. 
 
Igor: 
All the time, every day of your life? 
 
Audience Member: Of course not – 
 
Igor: 
The answer to that would be a no.   
 
Anthony: 
This is what psychologists could call the mask of insanity.   
 
Igor: 
Well, what may be happening is you may have a less of a personal 
awareness in terms of when you’re in a state shift.  And I 
understand because I was in very much the same place.  And that 
may just be a question of you doing more self-hypnosis and other 
practices to be aware of when you have shifted.  The fact is you do 
it.  Have you ever been in love?

Audience Member: Yes. 
 
Igor: 
Have you ever had that love returned the same time?  Sort of like 
an out of sync relationship.  It’s like you’re just having them adoring 
you, and you’re adoring them, again, ooooh, oooooh -- 
 
Audience Member: Of course, yes.   
 
Igor: 
Yes, and that felt differently than the way you did right now, right?   
 
Audience Member: Yeah.   
 
Igor: 
Absolutely.  Well, I would hope, right?  So, then it’s exactly the 
same kind of thing we’re talking about here only yours occurs 
spontaneously.  Now we’re going to recreate it by you doing that 
first.  It doesn’t have to be the same feeling of intense love and all 
that sort of stuff.  That’s appropriate to a romantic relationship, not 
appropriate when you’re speaking to a bank manager for example.  
Unless you like him so much, who knows?  But the point is you have 
to be able to recreate similar experiences inside yourself to make 
this easy.  Can you do it without that?  Sure you can.  I’ve seen it 
done and I’ve done it.   
 
The only problem is it’s a lot harder and there’s a lot more things 
that have to happen.  You have to be a lot more aware of the other 
person.  The easiest route is to feel it, look, feel, and then make 
that switch.  That’s the easiest part.  And if you aren’t aware of that 
whole cycle yet, a little bit of practice will help.  Do you do any self-
hypnosis or anything like that? 
 
Audience Member: A lot.   
 
Igor: 
Do you enjoy it? 
 
Audience Member: Yes, definitely.  
 
Igor: 
And you know you feel different when you’re doing self-hypnosis? 
 
Audience Member: Absolutely.

Igor: 
So, when you speak to the other person, see if you can get yourself 
close to the same way you feel when you do self-hypnosis.  But just 
manage to continue talking at the same time.   
 
Audience Member: Okay.   
 
Igor: 
That’s what you’re looking for.   
 
Audience Member: That’s nice advice.   
 
Igor: 
Say again? 
 
Audience Member: Nice advice.   
 
Igor: 
It’s really saying the same thing we’ve been saying all day, just in a 
slightly different way.  Hopefully that helps for you to connect to 
that. 
 
Anthony: 
And again, because you only had seven minutes, you know it’s kind 
of time limited.  There is a part of you that wants to get in to the 
exercise, the actual structure of this technique.  The fact is you 
weren’t feeling it.  You weren’t feeling the connection.  So to try 
and push forward at that point was a mistake in my opinion.   
 
Igor: 
Right. 
 
Anthony: 
You’re just not there yet.  Until you’re -- even a hint of a 
connection, it’s a bit like when you try and make people lose 
weight.  And all you’re really trying to make them aware of is, in the 
moment they’re feeling satisfied.  Because right now all they’re 
saying is I’m hungry with a sigh, or I’m never hungry.  They’ve lost 
sensitivity with regard to I’m satisfied or I’m full.  And in this 
situation, as he said, yes it’s a bit more subtle than blindly in love 
and completely neutral.  But it’s just becoming a bit more aware of 
those subtle shifts in yourself.  And I think that is a great answer 
there, is I would just use my partner almost like a fixation point.   
 
I know I often talk about people being props and whatever else, but 
at some point her mind, the back of her head, whatever, beyond 
their eyeball is going to become my point of fixation.  And if your 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
373 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
changing state is the self-hypnosis, which you’ve done lots of or 
loads of times, whatever it is that you said there, then that’s where 
I’d be trying to drop to if I was you.  Because at that point, your 
pupil is going dilate, your breathing’s going to shift, they’re going to 
get that sense of connection with you and they’ll start to follow 
you.  And then you can test it.  Then you can lead.  You can bring 
them up as he did, and put them back down again.  That’s when 
you know you’ve got the connection.  So, maybe you just needed a 
bit longer.   
 
Igor: 
Any other troubleshooting questions here?  Well, let me just check 
with you, are you still hearing us in the back there, James?  Okay. 
 
Audience Member: It’s not really a troubleshooting because it was not a trouble here, 
but what I found different about this last experience was that we 
were kind of hypnotizing each other back and forth, back and forth.  
And it was quite enjoyable.   
 
Igor: 
One would hope.  But wait, this is true of hypnotic conversations as 
a rule.  They are actually very enjoyable.  I enjoy them immensely 
when I get into them and partly because I don’t have to think my 
way through them as much.  I can just feel my way through them 
more.  And you do get back as much as you give in, so yep.  I can 
totally see where you’re coming from that.   
 
Audience Member: I have to add up to that what he was saying since both of us were 
conversing with each other.   
 
Igor: 
Okay. 
 
Audience Member: And I believe your suggestion, oh let’s call it a post-hypnotic 
suggestion, where you’re parallel to be pulled by yourself, how you 
feel about it. The same thing when I was trying to remember the 
words – when I was trying to remember the words and methods, it 
did not work as well.  As we relaxed and we started talking about 
interesting, fascinating stuff that’s happening around here, wow, it 
just clicked.   
 
Igor: 
It just opens up.  Thank you for sharing that because that really is 
one of the big messages I want to get across.  It took me maybe the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
374 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
best part of a year, year and a half to figure out I was trying way to 
hard. Right? There is a lot of stuff in here and there’s a lot more 
ways we can make it sophisticated and we’ll talk about a few of 
those later on.  But, I don’t want to move beyond this point until 
the message comes across that it’s actually very easy when you let 
your unconscious mind do the work.  And the easiest way of doing 
that is to switch it on inside itself.   
 
Whether you call it self-hypnosis or you call it H+, or you call it think 
of someone you love, or you call it a mutual hypnosis, honestly the 
term will change according to the industry.  It could be your chi 
energy in chi gong for example, right?  It might be you’re opening 
the chakras in some other system.  The metaphor is not the 
important part as long as you can connect to the idea we’re trying 
to present, which is fundamentally, you begin to feel differently 
first and that allows the whole nature of the conversation to change 
with it.  That’s one of the main keys.  Does that make sense to you 
guys?  Okay one more, just pass it down.   
 
Audience Member: It’s just about how to transition onto the vehicle.   
 
Igor: 
Yes.   
 
Audience Member: That’s what I found tricky because I was so involved in the 
conversation.   
 
Igor: 
I like that.  And anyone else find that difficult?  Yes?  No?  Maybe 
so?  Right.  The first thing to do is you got to figure out what 
different kinds of vehicles fit into what situations.  Right?  The 
second thing to do is you figure out how do you change topics in a 
conversation?  Well how do you introduce topics?  How does a 
conversation change topics normally?   
 
Audience Member: Somebody comes up with a different idea.   
 
Igor: 
Someone comes up with a different idea?  What else happens?   
 
Audience Member: Segue from one idea to another.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
375 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Segue from an idea.  You all have friends and you have 
conversations, don’t you?  And when someone says something and 
you’re about to say – let’s say you were talking about boats and 
you’ve got this great fishing story you want to tell and then halfway 
through the boat thing, they tell you the damn computer crashed 
and someone probably said, “Yeah, my computer crashed too.”  
And I went to the store around the corner and you go, “Curse you.  
My fishing story will rise again.”  Right?  We’ve all had this, right?   
 
And of course, we’ve all had the slightly socially awkward moment 
where we’re so desperately hanging on that one story we think we 
can contribute, the fishing story.  But then by the time they’re 
talking about frocks and dresses and little strappy lace shoes, you’re 
going, “And then I went fishing.”  And everyone goes, “What the 
hell?  What’s wrong with you?”  Right?  So yes, we must be aware 
of the social vibe, which means we need several vehicles that will 
allow us to fit into different conversations.   
 
I have a couple of favorites and really the big skill comes, and this is 
what we’ll be focusing more in the March event, it’s just because 
we need more time to produce it, is to be able to invent vehicles as 
you go along.  Invent excuses that will allow you to speak about 
hypnotic themes.  
 
Anthony: 
Yep. 
 
 
My Friend John 
 
Igor: 
Now, let’s find a very simple technique.  There’s one which you’re 
all familiar with, or at least if you’ve got any Ericksonian kind of 
inclination, you will know this technique, this method.  However, it 
gives us a lot of scope when it comes to regular conversation.  
Would you be interested in finding that one out?   
 
Audience Member: Yeah. 
 
Igor: 
Who has ever heard of the My Friend John technique?  Anyone?  
Who has actually used the My Friend John technique?  Well, that’s 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
376 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
quite good.  Who uses it on a regular basis?  Is your friend John that 
is actually doing this?  No.  And this is the key thing.  The point is 
whenever you have a conversation; it’s very easy to introduce 
someone that you know that opens a whole new topic of 
conversation.  Right?  And all you need is any overlapping idea.  For 
example, give me a topic of conversation one might be having.   
 
Audience Member: Shoes.  
 
Igor: 
Shoes.  We’ll talk about shoes.  Now I could talk about a friend of 
mine who loves cowboy shoes.  Now he also happens to be a 
hypnotist.  And when he hypnotizes in those brand new cowboy 
shoes, that he had to find to go into his show, here’s some of the 
things that happened.  See how we just transitioned very smoothly 
from shoes to something else.  Another topic? 
 
Audience Member: Lunch. 
 
Igor: 
Lunch.  What kind of lunch are you having?   
 
Audience Member: Fish and chips.   
 
Igor: 
You’re sitting there eating fish and chips.  Well, the last time I had 
fish and chips I was with my martial arts instructor down in Devon, 
which is actually true, and we started talking about how can we get 
people more attuned to what they’re doing because if they over 
think the move then it doesn’t work out right.  And he has a very 
interesting insight.  All you have to do is focus.  Do you see where 
we are going with this?  Do you see how the My Friend John 
technique is actually, I think, an ingenious method and it’s totally 
undervalued by people because they go, well, I don’t have that 
many friends called John.  Right?   
 
And you don’t have to say My Friend John; you just basically 
introduce a slice of your life.  I would strongly recommend you stick 
with actual genuine things that happen in your life and then just 
hijack them.  Let them move towards whatever conversation you 
want to have and introduce that topic.  So you then have My Friend 
John, which makes a segue into a theme, like a hypnotic topic, like 
people are fascinating, or the power of the mind, or how sleep 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
377 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
works or anything like that.  And then you have your vehicle ready 
and waiting for you.  Does that make sense?   
 
Anthony: 
I mean something else that you’re probably familiar with, certainly 
if you know things like My Friend John, is conscious/unconscious 
disassociation.  Right?  It’s not as complicated as it sounds.  The way 
I practice this, again I’m fortunate in that I’ve done lots and lots of 
therapy sessions.  The therapy session is some history gathering 
and a pre-talk or a conversation, it looks like a conversation, it’s 
not.  There’s certain objectives I want to achieve, cracking beliefs, 
things like that.  There’s a point in that conversation where I just 
say, “What do you think hypnosis is?”  And they say, relaxation, or 
nothing, or I’ve got no idea, or whatever else it happens to be.   
 
And I normally say, “That’s right.”  The next thing I say, there’s a 
couple of terms that you’ll know, but I’ll just explain what they 
mean in the context of my work.  You’re going to hear me talking 
about your conscious mind.  You’re going to hear me talking to your 
unconscious.  And I’m sure you know…   
 
So, I’ll introduce the model and people just nod because it’s a 
model that’s certainly in this part of the world that is universally 
accepted by everybody.  And if you know about conscious and 
unconscious disassociation, it is a technique of inducing trance, 
where you simply kind of list the characteristics of the conscious 
and the unconscious.   
 
Now this is perfectly suited to conversation in a pub, in my opinion. 
Whether you’re talking about martial arts or I took this course, it 
was all about focus, or I met this guy, he’s a persuasion expert, 
according to him, he believes that experts and such and such simply 
need to be more aware of their conscious and unconscious.  “Oh, 
well what do you mean?”  “Well, your conscious mind, as far as he’s 
concerned, just that part of your mind that thinks it’s the few things 
you’re aware of in any moment.  Whereas your unconscious is 
everything else.  It’s literally all of your memories and experiences 
and learnings.   And because your conscious mind is limited, it tends 
to be logical.  It tends to be linear in the way it approaches a 
problem.”   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
378 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Just like earlier on when we were speaking about such and such, 
but we’ve all had experiences.  We’re working on a problem, it 
might be a puzzle.  It could be a crossword and you’re stuck on 
those last few clues and you toss it to one side.  And then the next 
time you chance upon it, the back of your mind just comes forth 
with an answer.  So, that for me is – I could waffle on in this way 
forever.  But what I’m trying to say is my intention at that point in 
the session, even though I know I’m going to use rapid induction in 
a moment, so for the next five, ten minutes, I’m going to get to the 
hypnosis part, my sole intention, once I get to that segment, is to 
never reach the induction.   
 
It’s to hypnotize with conscious/unconscious disassociation.  Does 
that happen for more than one in fifty people?  No, not to a degree 
that their eyes shut and they slump in the chair, but I can tell you a 
large portion of those people start to feel that split and they start to 
glaze over and I’m thinking they’re receptive now and I’m on it.  
And at that point, I am in hypnotist mode.  I am in H+ mode.  My 
sole purpose is whatever I say, whatever question I have to deal 
with, I’m going to get straight back on that hypnotic track again.  If 
they divert me for a second, I’m just going to be straight back on 
that track as soon as I’ve fielded that question.   
 
So, that’s kind of how I’ve practiced this conversational piece is by – 
Let’s say you’re out there doing some direct hypnosis and as part of 
your pre-talk someone says, “Oh, what is it?” Or where you say, 
‘Look, what do you think hypnosis is?’ I know yesterday we were 
saying don’t give them a lecture on hypnotherapy if you don’t have 
to.” The only opportunity to give them a lecture on hypnotherapy is 
if that lecture has purpose, which is I’m going to hypnotize you 
without you knowing it.  And I’m going to practice my 
conversational covert hypnosis while I’m at it.   
 
So, to me that’s the conscious/unconscious thing, just list the 
characteristics and turn your intent.  You turn this way 
conscious/unconscious and you turn this way and slow down and 
mean it and give them the unconscious.  That causes trance in 
connection.  
 
Igor: 
So, let’s have a quick question from Robin. 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
379 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
 
Robin: 
Well, what I was going to ask is what do you do if somebody won’t 
shut up? 
 
Igor: 
Well, we’ll come on to that right now.  Shut up.   
 
Anthony: 
Stop talking.  You think I’m a counselor? 
 
Audience Member: That was easy.   
 
Igor: 
I know, it’s great.  There’s all kinds of things that you can work 
within.  It can get very sophisticated in conversations because they 
can go all over the place.  The key thing is if you’ve got the 
atmosphere in the right place that will be a great starting point.  
Secondly, and we’ll be practicing in a minute by the way, if you have 
to introduce an idea of interest to them, if they go, “Tell me more.”  
Have you ever wanted somebody to tell you about something?  It’s 
a little conversational hook you put in and they’ll go, “Well, what 
about that thing, tell me more about that.”   
 
Oh sure, well the conscious mind this and the unconscious mind 
that, or My Friend John was doing this and so on. Right? So when 
we practice now is actually exactly that.  It’s how to make that 
transition and how to make that transition in a way that people will 
actually listen.  There are two things we will be doing: the first one 
we’ll be doing now and the second one is basically you’re going to 
solve the hard case problems, the ones where people won’t stop 
talking.  And they’ll be introduced in similar ways.  So what I want 
you guys to do now, we’ve got about 15 minutes or so before we 
have another break.   
 
Again, just spend about five minutes apiece doing this and we’ll 
come back and set up for the next piece.  I want you to find a 
different partner and I want you to start a normal conversation with 
them.  During that conversation, I want you to find an excuse, a 
reason that fits the context of the flow to talk about someone you 
actually know, in other words you start changing the topic.  And in 
the back of your mind, and you’re not going to do this yet, but in 
the back of your mind your aim is to do the heart massage.  
Remember the heart massage?  Where you just basically focus on 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
380 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
someone you love, feel those feelings, and you’ll have that 
connection, or the ring finger, or something like that.   
 
Does that make sense?  Now, how are you going to introduce the 
actual heart massage stuff?  What’s going to allow you to speak 
about it in a way that’s going to create the experience?  Somehow 
you have to introduce a story, so you already start having ideas 
filtering through your minds of people who had some experiences.  
That story has to involve someone focusing on someone that 
special to them, someone they love. Right?  And somehow it’s 
associated to part of themselves or like the touching of the hand or 
the ring or something like that.  Right? So, let me give you some 
examples of what I mean just to kind of put some clarity on to this.   
 
If you knew the history of the wedding ring, I don’t know what it is, 
you might look up Wikipedia, you sometimes do this to get nice 
interesting stories.  Let’s invent a story of a wedding ring, although 
it doesn’t have to the case.  Let’s say the wedding ring was put on a 
certain finger of a hand because that’s kind of the meridian that 
goes straight to your heart.  Right?  Let’s assume that’s true.  And 
I’m just giving this as an example of what kind of thing I mean.  You 
can talk about a friend of yours is getting married.  He wants to 
have a non-traditional wedding; he wants to put it on the other 
finger.   
 
And his wife said, “No.  Don’t work with that finger, the other finger 
goes straight to your heart.”  You had to stop and think about that.  
When you think of all the people that you love, part of Chinese 
medicine is talking about which part of your hands are linked to 
which part of your experiences and so on.  So if you want to think 
about someone you really love, this, the ring finger, is the one 
that’s important.  And I might actually touch the ring itself.  And the 
reason people put a ring on their ring finger is a symbol to remind 
them of someone they really love.  Do you know what I mean by 
that?  Right?   
 
And that’s what’s already going on right now.  You see, like looking 
around the room, half of you are starting to go out of it.  The other 
half is like, yeah, that kind of makes sense, that’s nice.  And then 
we’re going to start to introduce the actual story that’s going to 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
381 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
allow you to invoke the sensation and anchor it in.  But we’ll come 
into that after the break.  At the moment, all I want you guys to be 
able to do is to introduce the vehicle that will allow you to 
introduce the story itself.  Does that make sense?  Have a story in 
the back of your mind.   
 
Can everyone think of a situation in which you or a friend or 
someone you know of or someone you’ve seen on TV or a play 
you’ve seen, or a movie you’ve seen where an individual inside of 
your reference experiences was thinking about someone they really 
love and they transformed them in a positive way.  Can anyone 
think of something like that?  Only a few people?  So, actually think 
about that.  Just consider that, in your own lives there have been 
hundreds of times where you thought about people that you loved.  
People that you know have thought about people that they love.   
 
You’ve seen films, for example, what if you saw a film where 
someone gave up the last place on the bus out of hell because it’s 
for that person they love.  They’re giving something up, but its okay 
with them.  They’re happy.  They’re at peace because they’re doing 
it for someone that they love.  Wouldn’t that give you a chance to 
talk about people that people love?  Would that be fair to say?  I 
mean it’s relatively easy to do, isn’t it?  Somebody is in a 
relationship and thinks, you know, do I want to be in a relationship?  
Well, let’s answer the question, do you love this person?  Right?   
 
Think of all the people and I had to give some advice here, think of 
all the people that you love.  You know, your parents, your friends, 
maybe this particular person and ask yourself, how much do you 
love them?  And really focus on someone you love so you know 
what it feels like.  Really think about that.  Do you see how you can 
introduce the idea of love in a million different ways?  Does that 
make sense to you guys?  Let’s have another show of hands.  Does 
everyone have an example in their minds of a situation in which 
people will focus on someone they love?  Yes?  A specific example.   
 
Anyone not have a specific example in their minds yet?  Anyone not 
care?  Okay, so again, for those of you thinking about that, have you 
ever given a friend a pep talk to get them to think about something 
that’s important to them?  It might not be someone they love.  It 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
382 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
might be something that’s important to them.  Have you ever 
helped a friend or your sister or sibling to refocus their attention on 
someone?  For example, my sister is going through a tough time in 
a relationship, and basically she’s getting to the point where she’s 
getting a little naggy and she’s always finding the flaws that she’s 
going to be focusing on and so on.   
 
And she’s saying, “Oh, I’m fed up with all this sort of stuff.”  I said, 
“Look, what is it you like about this guy?”  Think about it.  That’s an 
interesting question, isn’t it?  What is it you like about the people 
you like?  It’s something that she thought about and says, “Well, 
you know, he makes me feel certain ways.”  So we feel that way.  
You see what we’re doing right now?  Again, reintroduce the same 
vehicle.  Now, does everyone have an idea of something like that 
inside their mind?  Put your hands up.  Okay.  That’s enough for me 
for the moment.  If you haven’t got an idea just yet, work on it as 
you go second.   
 
Let someone else be the hypnotist first.  And by the time it’s your 
turn, your unconscious mind should have revivified these 
experiences enough to go, “Oh, I know something like that, it’s 
easy.”  Now your job is not to tell that story, by the way, guys.  Your 
job is not to tell that story.  Your job is to spend about two minutes 
having chit chat and to be able to introduce that story.  Introduce 
that character in a My Friend John sort of way.  It can be from a 
movie.  It can be from a book you read.  It can be from a poem.  It 
can be from something you’ve watched on TV; a documentary.   
 
It can be an actual person you know.  It can be about someone you 
heard about; a friend of a friend.  It can actually be yourself if you 
want it to be.  It really doesn’t matter.  It gives you a lot of scope.  
You just want to introduce the story and segue from whatever 
they’re talking about.  It doesn’t really matter what it is.  You’re 
looking for an excuse to go, oh, here’s a good point to make a 
transition.  And you make the transition.  Does that make sense to 
you guys?  You look for an excuse to make the transition.  You make 
the transition.  You introduce that person and as soon as you’ve 
done that, do you know what you do?  You go, “I’m done.”  So I’m 
not really expecting any of the over hypnotic things to happen yet.

Does that make sense to everyone?  You can do this?  Five minutes 
apiece, off you go. 
 
Igor: 
All right, how did it go?   
 
Audience Member: Good.   
 
Igor: 
Who found making the transition relatively easy?  Yes?  Easy 
transition to make?  Does that answer your question from before?   
 
Audience Member: Yes.   
 
Igor: 
Okay.  So, any questions come up as a result of that exercise or was 
it pretty straight forward?  Pretty straight forward?  Okay.   
 
 
Magic Moments 
 
Igor: 
And I realize there are kissing cousins.  You won’t necessarily use 
them the same way.  You could use one to augment the other and 
vice versa.  What I want to do now is you’ve learned how to turn a 
conversation and make it hypnotic, right?  There are other ways 
you can do it of course, but you have a simple vehicle for that.  You 
have learned how to steer a conversation.  So you can introduce the 
very vehicle that will allow you to make it hypnotic, is that fair?  So 
now the only thing we need to do is to make sure that we can do 
that every time we want.   
 
In other words, how do we turn a conversation when it won’t let 
itself turn?  For example, in Robin’s example, we have some just go 
yada yada yada yada, ahh, yada yada yada, ahh yada yada yada 
yada, and it’s like, what?  All right, let’s just calm down here a little 
bit. All right?  The answer in this is really the same way as hypnosis 
is.  You have interrupt the pattern and you know when someone 
comes to shake your hand and you just refuse to shake it, not 
because you’re not wanting to, it’s just because you’re pulling back 
a little bit.  It interrupts them slightly.  Right?

And the thought process stops and goes, oh, what’s this?  Right?  
We want to trigger that part of their mind.  The simplest way of 
doing that is what I call magic moments.  They’re little, should I say, 
pieces of theater, if you want to call it that way, that just arrest 
people’s attention.  It could be a little story.  It could be a little 
game you play with them.  It could be a little magic trick.  One of 
these things is a magic moment.  Have you ever noticed that as 
soon as these things start happening, everyone shuts up and starts 
watching what’s going on.  No way, I can’t believe that’s going on, 
can you believe that’s going on?  Did you all notice that happens?   
 
Audience Member: Absolutely. 
 
Igor: 
Now if you recall, is it Nayiev that I did the demo with earlier today?  
If you recall, before we produced the story, which was what?  The 
deer of the yoga and how our attention goes, energy flows, and so 
on, right?  Before I introduced that story, I did something with him, 
didn’t I?  Or was it during the story?  It could’ve been during the 
story actually.  It doesn’t really matter.  The point is that’s the 
moment where the story became unusual.  Something else is 
starting to happen.  The mind’s going like, whoa, what’s going on 
here?  We want to create those things.  
 
Anthony: 
And just to point out what I saw there, there was a genuine shift.  
Again, it relates to your question.  When he first started with you, 
because of the nature of the technique, he was kind of explaining it, 
and you were very much the attentive student.  It wasn’t that you 
wouldn’t shut up, but you – 
 
Igor: 
Thinking. 
 
Anthony: 
You were thinking and you were listening and you were nodding.  
And it was like, yep, yep, I’ve got that, I’m listening, yes.  And then it 
was suddenly shift, shift, bang, I’ve interrupted you.  He’s got his in 
and that’s when the story started to flow and before you know it, 
you were nodding like this.  
 
Igor: 
So, the key to magic moments is we’re looking for three key 
emotions, right?  The way I like to call them, actually I borrowed the 
phrase from someone else; you want an “A-ha” moment and “ahh” 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
385 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
moment, or “A haha” moment.  Basically, if someone wants to say 
to himself, I knew it, ha! It confirms something and they go, yes, “ah 
ha” that’s it.  It’s an insight.  You can have an “ahh” moment, which 
is like an emotional thing.  It’s like, wow, that’s touches me.  Or you 
can have a funny moment, a “haha” moment where it’s like, oh, 
that’s so funny; this is the craziest thing, right?   
 
A joke can be a magic moment.  Have you ever noticed when 
people talk about introducing yourself of networking meetings or 
just meeting people, they say you have to break the ice and you 
have to tell a joke to break the ice.  Have you heard of that phrase?  
Humor is only one way of breaking that ice.  And when they say 
break the ice, well what they’re really saying is create a magic 
moment so that the whole situation shifts, the whole context of the 
conversation goes to a different degree.  Does that make sense? I’d 
like to show you a simple magic moment.  I’ll give you two of them.  
You may as well have these.  You already have two.   
 
This is one, this is another one.  Make sense?  If you don’t want to 
do anything overtly hypnotic, here’s a couple of one’s which I think 
are a lot of fun, which I like to use.  The first one, if I could borrow 
you Stephen, is very simple.  It’s the where attention goes, energy 
flows one. If someone -- Put your feet together, Ace, for a moment.  
Now I want his balance to be a little bit effectible.  Do you see how 
he’s all over the place here?  Normal balance.  Now if I get him to 
focus on the top of his head onto the top of his ear, I’m actually 
going to touch his ear so he’s got a focal point to go on.  Just nod 
your head when you have your attention all the way there.  And 
keep your attention there.   
 
Now what happens is, as soon as your attention goes somewhere, 
notice how much harder it is to keep your balance, right?  It’s just a 
natural part.  Just try it out.  It’s just a natural thing.  You’ll do it 
with each other in a minute.  Now move your attention all the way 
down to your belly button.  Think about your belly button.  You 
might even breathe low and deep if that helps you to think about it 
there.  And when you have it, keep your attention there and let me 
know.  Very good.  All right.  Now see how much more stable it is.  
Can I push him off balance?  Of course, I can. But he’s much more 
stable because his attention is at his point of balance rather at the 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
386 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
point close to the largest imbalance.  The higher up you go in the 
body, the more imbalanced it becomes.  Does that kind of make 
sense?  Give him a nice round of applause.   
 
So how do we do this conversationally?  Right?  You’re having a 
chat about whatever it is and really one of my favorite ploys, if I 
can’t make anything else work is to say something like, “You know, 
that reminds me of something pretty cool. Stand up for a second, 
you’ll love this.”  Right?   
 
I can talk about shoes, old hats, paper boats, the pygmy trials of 
Australia, I don’t know, it doesn’t really matter, right?  Somewhere 
in the conversation if I can’t fit in otherwise, I’ll go, “You know 
that’s really interesting, but you just made me think of something 
so cool, I have to show you this.”  Do you notice the same sort of 
pattern that you’ve been doing on the streets already?  Right?  “Do 
you mind if I show you something cool?  I’d like to introduce you to 
something amazing.”  Right?  It’s the same thing.   
 
It’s just you’re interrupting the conversation to do it.  Now as soon 
as you get them with a balance, playing around, or whatever else it 
is, even if it’s one of these things, you now have a window of 
opportunity.  Those of you who just did the finger magnets and 
stopped.  Anyone do that at some point?  Do a finger magic and 
stop in the streets?  Did you notice that as soon as it’s succeeded, 
there’s this moment of expectation where people don’t know what 
to do with themselves.  They’re waiting for more, like, “That’s really 
cool.  Tell me more.  Do you have more things in your bag of 
tricks?”  Did you notice that? That window is your window of 
opportunity to introduce your story which then becomes the covert 
anchor and so on.  Make sense to you guys?   
 
The thing to avoid and this is something that will be a temptation, 
especially if you have something like the Madigan magic card which 
is like 59 of these different games you can play with people.  The 
thing to avoid is to become a dancing monkey that just does one 
after another after another and then after another.  Magicians can 
get into this routine a little bit when they play, but a magic trick is a 
great magic moment when it’s presented well.  When it has one of 
those three emotions that it evokes.

But the problem is a magician comes, “Here’s a trick.  Here’s 
another trick.  Now pick another card.  Now pick another card.  Now 
pick another card.  Now pick another card.  Now pick another card.  
It kind of gets a bit tedious after a while, doesn’t it?  So magic 
moments are magical because it’s like a little spice, right?  You 
don’t want to have the whole chili pot in your soup unless you’ve 
got some crazy taste buds.  You just want to have enough to make 
it spicy.  Do you see how that works?  Would you like another magic 
moment?  Yes?   
 
(Igor has someone standing with their arm straight out.) …Make 
themselves weak and strong all the time.  Just make this strong and 
I’m going to push down, these resist, right?  Pretty strong, right?  
Now, I’m going to show you something that’s going to make you 
take your own power away in moments.  Show your vote for A or B, 
quickly.   
 
Audience Member: B. 
 
Igor: 
Oh, I like that.  Okay.  Make it strong.  Now I’m going to take all 
your power away, ready for this?  All gone.  How did that work? 
 
Audience Member: You poked him in the eye.   
 
Igor: 
All right.  I won’t go near. I won’t poke him in the eye.  Make it 
strong.  Resist, you know what’s coming now, right?  You know 
what’s coming, make it strong.  I’m going to take your strength 
away, are you ready for this? 
 
Audience Member: Yes.  
 
Igor: 
What the hell is going on here?  Right?  Of course, I’m cheating and 
I apologize for you.  This is just an example of how your mind works.  
When I poked you in the head, I’m triggering the startle reflex.  
Your brain goes into overdrive and goes, what’s going on here?  
While he’s trying to figure out what’s going on, there’s no strength 
left in the arm.  It’s a natural response.  The same thing happens 
when I wave my hand across one eye to the other.  The signal is 
going from one brain to the other and while it’s crossing, the little 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
388 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
bridge called the corpus callosum, from one brain half to the other.  
The brain gets confused for a while and it’s trying to figure out what 
to do with that image.   
 
Meanwhile, your body gets weak.  Now this is something we do all 
the time in daily life.  Think about it.  When we get overloaded by 
something, we think about all these different things and try to do 
everything at once.  We overload and we get literally weaker.  We 
become less effective, less productive.  Now, would you like to see 
how you can actually become more productive, get more done, and 
it makes it easier?   
 
Audience Member:  Of course. 
 
Igor: 
This is a trick I learned from a yogi; actually it was in Nazi Yoga boot 
camp, see where he’s going with this?  It’s all about where your 
attention is.  If our attention is all over the place, no wonder you 
get weak.   
 
But if you put your hand there, for example, for a moment, yeah, 
you’re going to feel maybe your chest, maybe a little bit of your 
heart beat, and so on as well.  I want you to just focus on the 
sensations and think about someone you really care about.  Now 
am I doing hypnosis?  I’ve got pre-direct now, haven’t I?  But the 
moment’s allowed me to do it.  Of course I’d be more covert about 
the whole thing.  And just talk about, in that camp I was thinking 
about someone I really love and it felt really good.  And with Neive 
we did a more indirect version of it. You’re feeling that now, aren’t 
you?  
 
Audience Member: Yes.   
 
Igor: 
Right?  And the crazy thing is there comes a point where the 
sensations just click.  The hand, the chest, the feeling, they’re all the 
same.  You can lift your hand off and as soon as it returns it feels 
just as strong.  Now I don’t know when that point, that click, comes, 
but when it comes, you know it comes.  You’ve got that now?   
 
Audience Member: Yes.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Igor: 
It’s pretty cool, isn’t it? 
 
Audience Member: It’s cool.   
 
Igor: 
And you can go to trust as often as you want.  You can go there, you 
can think about, I don’t know, pigeons and football and whatever it 
is, but as soon as that hand comes back it’s like, oh yeah, something 
important to remember.  And what this does is focus your mind and 
body on things of importance.  So things that you do are filled with 
that kind of energy, your love and the focus that gets the job done 
easily, quickly, and more enjoyably.  Not a bad thing to learn, is it?   
 
Audience Member: Definitely. 
 
Igor: 
Right?  Give a nice round of applause.   
 
Do you see how the magic moment very naturally translates into an 
opportunity to tell a story or in this case I’m basically doing what I 
know he does which is I’m doing my technique totally overtly, but 
no one realizes this as hypnosis because, oh no, it’s a result of his 
little brain thing he did.  Right?  But I’ve created a hypnotic context 
so actually it is hypnosis, it’s just they don’t realize it yet.  Does that 
make sense to you guys?  Any questions on that?  So you get the 
idea of magic moments?  You have four of them.  You know what 
the four are?  You’ve got the ear, the arm, or the eye; we have the 
fingers, or go the hands.  Right?  Ear, eye, fingers, hands.  Ear, eye, 
fingers, hands.  Ear, eye, fingers, hands.  Four of them.  Ear, think 
about the ear and the stomach.  Balance.  Eye is just move the hand 
across the eye, the arm comes weak.  Fingers closing, closing, 
closing.  Hands closing, closing, closing.  You have four magic 
moments to choose from.   
 
So what I want you to do now is just do a little grand finale if you 
would.  The grand finale is to take any of the three gifts we taught 
you yesterday.  Remember three gifts we did?  Self-hypnosis, the 
heart massage, and the mind massage.  Those are the three gifts.  
Right?   
 
I want you to take any one of those three gifts, whichever one you 
want to work with right now and I’d like you to give it to someone 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
390 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
in a conversation.  So you’re going to start.  We’ll give you a good 
ten minutes each to do this.  You’re going to start and you’re going 
to chat.  You’re just going to chat.  And at some point, I either use a 
magic moment because it’ll be a nice transition or if you can sneak 
your way into your story without the magic moment, even better 
because you’re smoothly navigating in.  You don’t need to have it.  
It’s a tool that you don’t have to use if you don’t want to.   
 
Does that make sense to you guys?  So whichever way you want to 
do it.  If you feel like you haven’t quite got the entrance, just go for 
the magic moment.  If the conversation is just begging for it, then 
don’t redirect it back to magic moments, come back again.  That’s 
just taking needless turns, right?  The key thing is you want to do 
the heart massage or do the mind massage.  Ideally, you link it to a 
trigger.  I like to trigger the mind massage to their breathing.  
Breathe out and relax.  I like to trigger their heart massage.  It used 
to be like a spot on the hand that they can just touch.  I kind of like 
this one now just because of what we’ve been doing here recently.  
It’s kind of nice.  Self-hypnosis, whatever you want. You don’t even 
have to call it self-hypnosis.  You can call it the instant power 
meditation.  It’s the same thing, really, isn’t it?   
 
So, do you see how the whole process works?  The key here is in 
exactly the same way as we started on the very first day, do not 
forget the basics.  Do not try and rush through this.  What are the 
basics here in terms of the actual hypnotic content?  Eye contact.  
Body.  Feel it yourself.  Start going to your self-hypnosis kind of 
state yourself.  Rhythm, notice your voice changing.  If your voice 
hasn’t changed, it’ll interfere with how you’re feeling.   
 
So that’s a good test for yourself.  Then your story starts evolving 
and you’re focusing on the power words.  You’re focusing on the 
ideas you want to suggest, which is basically focus on someone you 
love or calming thoughts.  Feel that emotion.  Feel that effect.  Link 
it to this.  Is that easy to do?  It’s a pretty straight forward cycle, 
isn’t it?  Any questions?  Yes, no?  All right, let’s take ten minutes 
apiece and go do that now.  Make someone feel good.   
 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

How did you guys enjoy that?  Was it good?  All right.  I don’t think 
that was the most enthusiastic I’ve ever heard.  Did you enjoy it or 
not?  Was it good?   
 
Audience Member: Oh yes! 
 
Audience Member: Yes! 
 
Igor: 
Did you get the idea of how to maneuver from a conversation into 
this hypnotic thing.  Sometimes you’ll need a vehicle to make that 
transition and sometimes it’s enough to just slide into it.  And if 
that’s fine then that’s what you do.  Does that make sense to you 
guys?  The rule of thumb is, as you get good at this, I mean after all 
we’ve just been doing this for a day now, but the better you get at 
this, the easier it is to slide a normal conversation into this other 
hypnotic thing and then you can do anything with it.   
 
 
Final Thought & Demo 
 
Igor: 
So what we’re going to do right now is just throw the floor open to 
last minute question and answer session or comments you have 
about anything in general.   
So really, if there’s anything we’ve covered that you want to ask 
about or anything we haven’t covered you want to ask about, now’s 
the time to do it.  So who’d like to have the magic mic?   
Audience Member: I came across when doing with subjects outside, that when giving 
them suggestions with finger vise or clasp hands and then I am 
suggested that this is happening, that’s happening, they just nod 
yes, yes.  What if they are talking?  How can I – Is it any relevance – 
Igor: 
Oh, the simplest way for me to handle that is say, “That’s it, focus 
on this now.  Really focus all your attention.”  They go, “Yes, I’m.”  
“No, no.  Focus all your attention.  That’s it, all.”  So, I’ll talk a little 
bit over them.  And I’ll encourage the idea of focusing more rather 
than commenting.  We don’t need to comment.  We need all your 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
392 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
attention on this.  And if they key on I might make a little joke and 
say, “Well, if you have enough attention left to speak, well you can’t 
really be focusing on this.”  Let’s get all their attention on that.   
Audience Member: Thank you. 
Anthony: 
I’m very similar.  I would just say, “That’s right.”  Obviously they go, 
ooh.  I’ll say, “That’s right, you don’t need to say anything, you don’t 
need to do anything.  Just continue to focus.”  So it’s the case of 
shut them down and put them back on the track again.   
Igor: 
And just to give an example of this, I actually had this happen, I 
think it was the first day out or yesterday, I can’t remember, were 
you the guy working with the gentleman with the stiff arm who kept 
saying, “But I can bend it, but I can bend it.”  Right?  So, he’s 
basically testing before he’s being asked to test it.  He’s doing the 
classic thing that Anthony was telling you about before.  So, to get 
past that, I said, “Well, of course you can bend it.  We’re not there 
yet.  We’re not there yet.  We’re not there yet.  Now just focus on 
this sensation here.”  Put your mind over here and feel this.  And 
with a little more of this distraction stuff to go around and 
eventually he’s arm locked up and went, “I can’t believe this. This is 
great.”  Right?  See what happened, hopefully?  My moment of 
glory, you better not have missed it.  The camera missed it, I can’t 
believe it.  But does that answer your question.   
Audience Member: Yeah, thank you. 
Igor: 
Any other questions or comments?  Praise and cash will be taken 
too.  I hope you have both, praise and cash.   
Audience Member: It’s just really, really quick.  When we first started on Monday and 
you did the finger thing – 
Audience Member: He’s talking about Friday, actually. 
Audience Member: This feels right.   
Audience Member: Time distortion.   
Audience Member: Time distortion.  You did this thing where you said you’re doing the 
things together and then you said, “Only as quickly as you could 
think about somebody” – 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London

Anthony: 
Oh yeah, no this is how I go into a finger lock.  It’s in the supplement 
to my book, but I’ll do it on you if you give the mic back or 
something like that.   
Igor: 
You may as well come up and someone can see you.   
Anthony: 
All right, there’s a difference between – we know there are some 
physiological reasons for this.  This, to me, bear in mind Igor and I 
have not worked together before, so I had no idea what his heart 
massage was or how that worked.  I was surprised when he turned 
that into a lock, into a binary situation as Kev and I had put it.  Just 
sit comfortably, okay.  I’ll tell you how I use this because you’re a 
hypnotherapist, are you?   
Audience Member: Yeah.   
Anthony: 
Okay.  When people come and see me to quit smoking, my view is 
that they’re problem is one of habit.  Right?  So my pretalk is 
actually to demonstrate that problem is one of habit, but most 
smokers have certain beliefs.  One is they believe they are addicted 
to nicotine; that’s their problem.  Therefore it would be painful to 
quit.  One is they believe it does something for them.  It relaxes 
them or something.  And I appreciate that’s how they feel.  But one 
of the core beliefs people have with hypnotherapists, and that’s why 
they call you their last resort, is that, “I can’t do it.  I’ve tried to do it.  
I can’t do it.”  Their belief is they can’t do it, okay?  So I say, “If you 
went to your doctor and your doctor said to you, ‘Quit smoking or 
you die,’ would you quit immediately?”   
Now let me just tell you if you ask people that question, you might 
expect 99 percent of people to say, “Yes, of course I would.  That’s 
stupid.”  But they don’t.  They go, “I’ll try.”  They said that to me, “I 
went in with a bad foot and he said that to me.  I’ll probably have 
two to get over the stress of the news, so I’d do my best.”  Very 
rarely does someone give me an emphatic yes.  Okay?  So whatever 
they say, you know, probably. I’ll say, “What I’m interested in is your 
beliefs about this.”  And I’ll ask that question and they’ll say, 
“Probably.”   
I’ll say – let’s just try something, okay?  It’s not hypnosis.  I’d like you 
to place your hands out in front of you and clasp them together 
tightly. Palms are together; your thumbs are crossed, tight.  Bend

your elbows like you’re making a desperate prayer and keep them 
tight.  Put your first fingers up about an inch apart.  Now look at the 
gap between your fingers because they will touch.  And when they 
touch, close your eyes.  Now with your eyes closed, think about the 
person who is dearest to you on this planet.  If there’s more than 
one, see more than one.  When you’ve got them there, nod your 
head.  And see their eyes.  See their smile.  Hear their laughter.  
Hear their voice.   
And feel what you feel for them.  Enjoy a pleasant memory involving 
them.  Step into your body if you’re not there already.  See their 
face.  See their smile.  Hear their voice.  Hear their laughter.  Feel 
that feeling.  And as you feel that and as you listen to my voice, your 
fingers are becoming stuck and bolted together.  Glued together, 
tighter and tighter.  As you feel that feeling and you listen to me, 
your fingers are becoming stuck and bolted.  Your hands are stuck 
together.  You can try and unstick them and find they’re stuck fast.  
Stuck fast.  When you realize they’re stuck, raise them up.  That’s 
right; raise them up a little higher.  Try even harder.  You’re a strong 
guy.  Put some effort and you’ll find they’re stuck.  
Now in a moment I’ll click my fingers, your eyes will open and 
you’re going to look at those hands.  You’re going to have a clear 
understanding of the power of your mind.  Open your eyes and look 
at those hands.  Are they your hands?  How long have you been 
over– just move your hands.  Your life, I guess.  Now understand, 
Robbie, look at me, as those hands stick tighter and tighter, look at 
me.  You have a super powerful mind.  When your mind has been 
expanded in this way, it will never go back to its old dimensions.  
Now close your eyes and sleep and relax.  Go deeper, deeper, 
deeper, deeper, down now. Sinking, floating, drifting to sleep.  
Deeper sleep.   
Now after you leave here, you are going to have a clear 
understanding of how you can use techniques you already know 
and you can add a large dose of emotion to those techniques and 
you can turn that into a very, very black and white situation.  The 
more emotion you add, the less choice, the less option the person 
you’re doing this exercise on has.  So in a moment I’ll count to five 
and on five you will be back in the room, ready for the rest of the 
session, ready for the rest of the day.  So, one, feeling wonderful as

those hands relax completely now.  Two, feel the surge of energy 
pouring in through your fingers and toes.   
Three, take that deep breath in, fill your chest up, that’s right.  Four, 
your head wash through.  And five, back in the room.  All right?   
Igor: 
Does that answer your question? 
Anthony: 
And what happens is they see that person, I don’t normally push it 
that far, their fingers lock, I’ll get the commitment.  I’ll say, “Now 
when you’re ready to make the decision to quit,” or change or 
whatever, “open your eyes so I understand.”  And they do this.  Now 
you know what I’m thinking, I’m thinking, you are utterly hypnotized 
at this point so I’m going to give you a suggestion.  So I say this, “You 
go to the doctor, the doctor says to you, quit smoking or that person 
will die immediately, would you quit?’’  And 100 percent of the 
time, I get an emphatic, “Yes!  That is the most ridiculous question 
I’ve ever heard.”  Right?   
I say, ‘Well, now you know you can do it, I’m going to show you why 
it’s been difficult to do in the past and I will show you why it’s going 
to be easy.”  There are three beliefs I need to crack.  That exercise 
combined with that nasty question out of nowhere is bang, there’s 
the first one gone.  They now believe there is a situation where they 
could do it.  Now all that’s hypothetical, I will pin that back on them 
and say, “And there are things you want to say to your child when 
she’s 20.  There’s things you’ll want to do for your son when he’s 30.  
And only you can do them.  Only you can say them, da da da da da.”  
I don’t mind using a bit of shock or emotion to get people to make 
decisions.  So that’s how you do it.   
Igor: 
All right, any other questions or comments of anything you’ve done 
so far?  All right, in that case, the last thing we are going to do today 
is kind of give you some freedom in terms of what you’ve been 
doing.  You’ve got a good grasp of how street hypnotism works, 
right?  Would that be fair to say?   
Audience Member: Yes.   
Igor: 
And you’ve given at least one person today a hypnotic gift covertly 
just in telling a story, just talking about stuff.  Would that be fair?  All 
right.  Now how do we do this with other gifts?  Because I’m 
guessing you just want to go around and give people heart 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
396 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
massages or mind massages.  It would be kind of nice to be able to 
invent your own gifts to go out in the future with things that you 
want to have, right?   
Anthony: 
There are so many of these things.  I know we’re tying this into a bit 
of a loop in saying you can come back to this and you can come 
back to this, and you can.  You’ve probably already got other 
examples of things you use.  Some of the guys in here do martial 
arts, so just demonstrated with Igor, a silly trap, that’s actually 
called the “stupid trap” by my instructor.  And they’re all used to 
demonstrate something.  There were stories where, it could even be 
kid stories; you read about the hand in the cookie jar or the monkey 
trap if you know that.  A coconut with rice inside, your hand can go 
in but your fist is too big to come out.   
And another really simple one, it was taught to me by – he is a 
mentalist that means performer, magician.  He’s also got 30 year’s 
experience as an Ericksonian style hypnotherapist.  And he’s an 
extremely good trumpeter, okay?  He learned this exercise as a kid, 
kind of discovered it by accident.  And later on in life learned it as, 
what he calls a mindfulness exercise.  He’s a bit of a Buddhist, a bit 
of a meditating hypno-guy.  And he showed me this exercise and I 
found there’s just so many applications for it.  I think I’ve 
demonstrated it, but I’m going to show it to all of you.   
Now because you’re all going to get there at different times, if you 
get there, again, just breathe, as before.  You have to count, but in 
for seven, out for eleven, while I speak to the rest of the group.  If 
you’re up for putting your computer down, or your drinks down, is 
that okay?   
Audience Member: Yeah, I just had to take care of something.   
Anthony: 
That’s cool, by all means, continue.  But if you got a drink, just put it 
down.  Just place your feet flat on the floor.  We’re nearly done now.  
All right.  And this is the exercise.  And I’m just going to take you 
through it.   
You know what a pulse is, okay?  And we all know we’ve got a post 
in our wrists, a pulse in our thumb.  Any nurses in here will tell you, 
you shouldn’t take someone’s pulse with your wrist.  What I’d like 
you to do is look at the back of your left hand now.  Don’t look at 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
397 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
me.  Don’t look anywhere else.  Just look at the back of your left 
hand on your lap.  And pick one spot on the square of your hand. 
Not on the finger, but on the actual back of your hand.  That’s right.  
Don’t look at me, just look at the back of your hand.  I want you to 
make a really tight fist with that hand.  If you’ve got long nails or 
some jewelry, be careful, but a tight fist.  Really tight, so you can 
actually feel the tension.  Now look at that spot for another second 
or two.  Really tight fist.  Close your eyes.   
This is not hypnosis, yet.  But as you focus your attention now, you’ll 
find it easy to focus on the fist and the actual feelings that are there.  
So I want you to pay attention to those fingers digging into your 
palm.  I want you to become aware of where your thumb is. Almost 
be your thumb for a moment, just wrapped around those fingers.  
You should be able to feel the skin stretching on the back of your 
hand over the knuckles.   
Now as I said, we have a pulse in our wrist and a pulse in our 
thumb.  What I’d like you to do now, again with your eyes closed, is 
just let – don’t undo the fist completely, but just let go of the 
tension.  Just feel the tension draining from your fist.  Just let go of 
the tension.  So there’s just enough space inside the palm of your 
hand that you could hold something like the size of a pebble.  Like a 
small creature, something that has a pulse.  
I want you to imagine in the palm of your hand there is something 
there that has a pulse of its own, something that’s expanding and 
contracting.  Really still yourself.  Go inside the palm of your hand.  
When you can feel the pulse in the palm of your hand, I want you to 
nod your head clearly so that I understand.  That’s right.  There’s 
lots of heads nodding.  If your head’s not nodding already, again, 
just relax and focus on the palm of your hand.  When you can feel 
your pulse there, nod your head, so I understand.  If you’ve nodded 
your head already again, just breathe in nice and slowly, breathing 
out even more slowly.   
Now in a moment I’m going to click my fingers, and when I click my 
fingers you’re going to feel that pulse jump to your index finger.  You 
will literally feel it now in your index finger.  Focus your attention on 
your index finger.  It may be the tip or the middle of the finger, but 
when you can feel that pulse in your index finger, nod your head so 
that I understand.  That’s right.  Head nodding.  If you nod your 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
398 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
head, you can relax.  I’m going to click again and they’re going to 
jump to another finger.  Consciously, I’d like you to try and guess 
which finger it will jump to.  But your unconscious mind is going to 
make the choice. So I’m going to click my fingers and it will jump to 
another finger.  And again, you’re going to have to tune in and find 
that finger.  But when you find it, just nod your head for me.   
 
Final Induction 
 
Anthony: 
If you guess correctly, nod your head.  If your unconscious chose 
another finger then just nod your head.  That’s right.  Now again, 
what I’d like you to do very slowly now, very, very slowly is – 
Igor: 
Focus. 
Anthony: 
And as you pay close attention to your hand – 
Igor: 
On what you’re doing – 
Anthony: 
I want you to allow that hand to very slowly – 
Igor: 
Simple ideas.   
Anthony: 
Begin to uncurl.   
Igor: 
To have profound meaning –  
Anthony: 
Almost like a flower opening – 
Igor: 
In everything you do. 
Anthony: 
Ever so slowly. 
Igor: 
We all have stories.   
Anthony: 
Paying attention to the knuckles. 
Igor: 
Histories. 
Anthony: 
The fingers.   
Igor:  
 
Moments in time.

Anthony: 
Those feelings and sensations –  
Igor: 
They’re important to us.   
Anthony: 
Often go overlooked.   
Igor: 
The unique thing – 
Anthony: 
And you may find – 
Igor: 
About being a human being –  
Anthony: 
As that hand opens –  
Igor: 
Is that you can –  
Anthony: 
A wooden, waxy feeling – 
Igor: 
Learn. 
Anthony: 
In the hand. 
Igor: 
From stories –  
Anthony: 
It may feel lighter. 
Igor: 
That you’ve never experienced before – 
Anthony: 
It may feel heavier than before.  
Igor: 
Now – 
Anthony: 
The thing is I know –  
Igor: 
As you rest. 
Anthony: 
That you know –  
Igor: 
There’s a story –  
Anthony: 
You have a conscious mind – 
Igor: 
Waiting to occur. 
Anthony: 
And you have an unconscious mind.   
Igor: 
A new history – 
Anthony: 
And your unconscious mind –

Igor: 
Of you – 
Anthony: 
Continues to hear – 
Igor: 
Developing – 
Anthony: 
Everything of importance to you now. 
Igor: 
Into greater maturity. 
Anthony: 
Although there’s part of you – 
Igor: 
A better person – 
Anthony: 
That’s trying to listen – 
Igor: 
And you can enjoy – 
Anthony: 
To everything I might say – 
Igor: 
The journey – 
Anthony: 
Here –  
Igor: 
Of becoming – 
Anthony: 
Or Igor – 
Igor: 
That exact person – 
Anthony: 
Embeds – 
Igor: 
There’s a time – 
Anthony: 
But you don’t need to pay attention – 
Igor: 
In which stories can take place –  
Anthony: 
Your conscious mind – 
Igor: 
And be of particular importance –  
Anthony: 
Can drift off. 
Igor: 
A long time ago. 
Anthony: 
Can wander here – 
Igor: 
In the Northern coastlines of Europe.

401 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Anthony: 
And they can wander there.   
Igor: 
There are people – 
Anthony: 
As your unconscious – 
Igor: 
Called the Vikings – 
Anthony: 
Continues to hear – 
Igor: 
They had powerful myths – 
Anthony: 
Understand – 
Igor: 
Legends – 
Anthony: 
And respond.   
Igor: 
That disguised important truths about who you are.   
Anthony: 
And where you’re going – 
Igor: 
About the power – 
Anthony: 
To go – 
Igor: 
That rests inside – 
Anthony: 
With a simple exercise – 
Igor: 
Now – 
Anthony: 
Because as you relax – 
Igor: 
One of those legends – 
Anthony: 
You can allow your unconscious – 
Igor: 
Was about a deity – 
Anthony: 
To find that part of you – 
Igor: 
Odin – 
Anthony: 
That holds on to any remaining doubts – 
Igor: 
The wisest – 
Anthony: 
May or may not have –

Igor: 
The trickster – 
Anthony: 
About your ability to do this successfully – 
Igor: 
An individual – 
Anthony: 
Some part of you – 
Igor: 
Of great insight – 
Anthony: 
That you can understand – 
Igor: 
And Odin – 
Anthony: 
And I know that you do – 
Igor: 
Wherever he traveled – 
Anthony: 
But behind every behavior – 
Igor: 
Was accompanied – 
Anthony: 
There is some purpose or intention – 
Igor: 
By two birds– 
Anthony: 
A positive intention – 
Igor: 
Two ravens – 
Anthony: 
Even though that behavior may sometimes get in the way. 
Igor: 
Dark as night – 
Anthony: 
Or be unwanted – 
Igor: 
With clever – 
Anthony: 
And you might call that – 
Igor: 
And wise – 
Anthony: 
A protective mechanism – 
Igor: 
One raven – 
Anthony: 
Now you can trust your creative mind – 
Igor: 
Was called Memory.

Anthony: 
To search now – 
Igor: 
The other raven – 
Anthony: 
Through those memories.   
Igor: 
Was called Thought.   
Anthony: 
Allow those thoughts to drift – 
Igor: 
Thought and Memory. 
Anthony: 
And give your creative mind the time – 
Igor: 
Memory and Thought.   
Anthony: 
To find other ways – 
Igor: 
And wherever Odin traveled – 
Anthony: 
Other choices – 
Igor: 
He would send his two ravens – 
Anthony: 
Other ways of keeping you safe – 
Igor: 
Ahead of him – 
Anthony: 
Well – 
Igor: 
Memory.  
Anthony: 
And protected.   
Igor: 
Thought.   
Anthony: 
And allow you complete freedom – 
Igor: 
Scouting the landscape ahead – 
Anthony: 
From those doubts – 
Igor: 
And finding – 
Anthony: 
Or any anxieties. 
Igor: 
Points of wisdom inside. 
Anthony: 
That’s right.  You may even notice –

404 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Odin had the power of time. 
Anthony: 
Those sensations in hand – 
Igor: 
He could send his thoughts to the future – 
Anthony: 
Or an arm – 
Igor: 
And remember – 
Anthony: 
Becoming lighter – 
Igor: 
What memory he saw there – 
Anthony: 
Or heavier. 
Igor: 
Thoughts are clear.   
Anthony: 
Your unconscious will choose – 
Igor: 
Memories are full. 
Anthony: 
From all those choices – 
Igor: 
One day – 
Anthony: 
The one it believes to be the best. 
Igor: 
Odin decided – 
Anthony: 
That satisfies that intention – 
Igor: 
To talk, to both Thought and Memory – 
Anthony: 
It keeps you safe, well, and protected.   
Igor: 
And he told them the story – 
Anthony: 
And will give you the freedom – 
Igor: 
About – 
Anthony: 
Use – 
Igor: 
A new skill he was developing now. 
Anthony: 
Your full potential. 
Igor: 
A skill that was of great importance to him.

Anthony: 
So before you drift up – 
Igor: 
Like magic – 
Anthony: 
I want you to go out into a fantasy. 
Igor: 
He sent Thought and Memory – 
Anthony: 
Get a sense of yourself walking out of this building. 
Igor: 
Out, into the future.   
Anthony: 
A new view – 
Igor: 
To hold him – 
Anthony: 
A new you. 
Igor: 
To find – 
Anthony: 
A new way of thinking.   
Igor: 
That future –  
Anthony: 
A new way of feeling.   
Igor: 
In which he’s thinking clearly – 
Anthony: 
Of doing things.   
Igor: 
His memory recalls the skills – 
Anthony: 
You can enjoy – 
Igor: 
And the magic just flows – 
Anthony: 
As you enter those situations – 
Igor: 
All the way – 
Anthony: 
With your increased flexibility – 
Igor: 
Into that future – 
Anthony: 
And those new skills – 
Igor: 
They flew – 
Anthony: 
Being happily unconcerned – 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
406 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Igor: 
Night and day.   
Anthony: 
Happily unconcerned.   
Igor: 
Floating through –  
Anthony: 
Unable to remember – 
Igor: 
The landscape of the mind – 
Anthony: 
To worry – 
Igor: 
Thought and Memory – 
Anthony: 
Or doubt – 
Igor: 
Side by side –  
Anthony: 
In the same way.   
Igor: 
Through that mindscape – 
Anthony: 
Or at all. 
Igor: 
Landscape.  Dreamscape.   
Anthony: 
I think you’ll enjoy – 
Igor: 
And develop – 
Anthony: 
Being happily unconcerned. 
Igor: 
A whole new world – 
Anthony: 
Because the harder you try and remember – 
Igor: 
In which he had – 
Anthony: 
What it was like to be concerned – 
Igor: 
That skill – 
Anthony: 
Just three days ago – 
Igor: 
That and magic.   
Anthony: 
The more distant those concerns will become.   
Igor:  
 
That ability – 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
407 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
Anthony: 
And when you try and find them – 
Igor: 
Nothing could prevent him from becoming this person – 
Anthony: 
They’ll just become more and more distant.   
Igor: 
That memory returned fast.   
Anthony: 
So you can enter that situation – 
Igor: 
Raven – 
Anthony: 
Safe, well, and protected.   
Igor: 
Sitting on the shoulder whispering thoughts – 
Anthony: 
And trust your unconscious – 
Igor: 
So that Odin could dream about the memories of that future.   
Anthony: 
All the things you’ve learned – 
Igor: 
And that same thought – 
Anthony: 
Everything you’ve heard – 
Igor: 
Perched on the other shoulder – 
Anthony: 
And seen over these last few days – 
Igor: 
And whispered ideas –  
Anthony: 
And even the useful things you learn – 
Igor: 
So that Odin could dream – 
Anthony: 
Before these last three days – 
Igor: 
A dream of power – 
Anthony: 
Will be there – 
Igor: 
A dream of integration. 
Anthony: 
And your trust – 
Igor: 
A dream of healing, uplifting sensations  
Anthony: 
Those ideas will come out –

Igor: 
And everything made sense.  
Anthony: 
And be expressed – 
Igor: 
And at that point – 
Anthony: 
Confidently.   
Igor: 
Odin could see the future.   
Anthony: 
Every other part of you now – 
Igor: 
All the twists and turns – 
Anthony: 
Makes the adjustments and changes – 
Igor: 
And he knew – 
Anthony: 
And accommodates this new choice.   
Igor: 
That the future that was coming.   
Anthony: 
Seamlessly into your life.   
Igor: 
It was a good future.   
Anthony: 
A part of who you are.   
Igor: 
Something you really wanted.   
Anthony: 
Part of your identity.   
Igor: 
Natural.   
Anthony: 
Part of your personality. 
Igor: 
Easy at every step of the way.  If you ever need it, a guiding hand, he 
turned to his left and allowed Memory to whisper to him, a dream 
of power.  He turned his right and allowed Thought to whisper to 
him, those thoughts that came from the dream of power.  In any 
event, at some point those stories, like every story came to an end.  
The interesting thing about these kinds of stories, these legends, 
these myths, is that sometimes they just were parts of a story.  And 
it’s the way that people interacted with them that really provided a 
natural ending.   
Now in some respects, you could say that what we’ve been doing 

Advanced Walk Up Street Hypnosis – Transcript Manual – Pt 2 - London 
 
409 WUSH Transcript Manual                          ©Street Hypnosis   All Rights Reserved 
 
for the last few days has been a kind of story, hasn’t it?  I mean, it’s 
been at least a history in terms of what you’ve been doing, has it 
not?  And it would be inappropriate for me to suggest that that 
story has come to an end because although this particular part of 
the story does, really the story doesn’t end until you go out there 
and live your life and bring it to its natural peak, it’s natural high 
point.  You know, they say that every ending is a new beginning.  
Every beginning is a new end.   
Well, let’s end all these beginning things.  And let’s just start 
thinking about stories.  And I wonder what stories you’ll be telling 
me the next time we meet.  Personally I do hope we get a chance to 
meet again sometime in the future because I do want to hear all the 
stories that you have to tell me.  Once you’ve been through this 
course, hopefully you’ll see the world in new eyes.  Would it be fair 
to say that you’re thinking about things a little differently?  And that 
you have some interesting memories that you can call on, draw 
upon, when that future comes to meet you.  So you can do things 
differently.  You can be a different person.  You can live a bigger, 
healthier, happier life. Would that be fair to say?  Yes?  Well, in that 
case all that’s left for us to say is to say thank you very much.  I’ve 
enjoyed myself and --  
Anthony: 
I have and I want to thank Igor for inviting me on the course.  This 
has been a great course.  I’ve learned a lot.  I can assure you I don’t 
stop learning.  I never get to a point where I think I know even a 
fraction about a subject.  I’ve said this already; this is a passion of 
mine.  I see this as an art and to be beyond mediocre, it’s really easy 
to be an average hypnotist.  It’s really easy to be an average guitar 
player who knows three chords.  And you can have some fun with it.  
But you can be so much better than that with just a little bit of 
application, practice, and being prepared to have a go, being 
prepared to stick your neck out and stretch yourself every now and 
again.  So thanks for your attention. 
Igor: 
To all of you guys.   
Anthony: 
And I’ll do my best to answer any questions that is put to me about 
things I’ve put out there with regards to hypnosis or things you’ve 
heard from me over this weekend.  So don’t feel that you can’t call 
me or email me or anything else, preferably not around midnight or 
anything, but feel free to get in touch.  I’m not running away.  And I

think you’ve done brilliantly.   
Igor: 
I agree. 
Anthony: 
I mean my business partner has been on the sidelines watching this.  
Normally he’s up here in the chair with me.  But I know, we’ve 
spoken about it, it’s been an awesome course.  And you might not 
quite know just how much you’ve got in the bag at this point with 
regard to your talk here.  One thing I do know, I’m encouraging you 
to carry on learning is that you’ve definitely got everything you 
would need in that tall bag to be able to do probably the vast 
majority of things that you dreamt of before you started studying 
this stuff.  So I’ll stop waffling.  Thanks a lot.  And stay in touch.   
Igor: 
Now give yourselves a nice round of applause. You deserve it.

Participant 1: 
So that was interesting.  When did you fly over here? 
Participant 2: 
I’ve been traveling about for a few months.   
Participant 1: 
Where were you before here? 
Participant 2: 
New Zealand.  I was in Australia for a few months.  Then I flew to 
London.  I travel Britain – 
Participant 1: 
You fly from direct from Sydney or something? 
Participant 2: 
No, I went up to Scotland, Wales – 
Participant 1: 
For work or just for having fun? 
Participant 2: 
For backpacking.   
Participant 1: 
Kind of meeting up with hypnotists along the way that you know? 
Participant 2: 
I met with John Chase in Bristol.   
Participant 1: 
Yeah, he is pretty cool.

Participant 2: 
But mostly it’s just been messing around, seeing the world.  Then I 
went to Ireland, a few weeks there.  Then I came up here and – 
Participant 1: 
Now you’re here for this.   
Participant 2: 
Yeah.   
Participant 1: 
You going to do some sightseeing in London? 
Participant 2: 
I’ve done that before.   
Participant 1: 
You’ve been here before. 
Participant 2: 
There are quite a few things I haven’t seen.  I’m meeting an old 
friend for dinner this Wednesday so I’ve got to be here for that.  
Then I’m back on the 24th for two weeks. 
Participant 1: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, cool.  Well, if you have nothing going on Tuesday 
night, me and my friend Ben, he’s a hypnotist; we’ll be hanging out 
somewhere in Central London, so – 
Participant 2: 
Yeah, I can do that.   
Participant 1: 
Yeah, cool, cool.   
Participant 2: 
I’ll give you my phone number after this.   
Participant 1: 
Is your phone like a local thing? 
Participant 2: 
I bought a cell at the airport for here. 
Participant 1: 
Oh, that’s what that was.  Cool, cool, cool.  So when you flew over 
here, was it literally a direct flight, one flight all the way over?   
Participant 2: 
We stopped for about two hours. 
Participant 1: 
Okay.  And did you get like the deliriousness, like delirious tiredness  
Participant 2: 
Yes and no.  I was with my grandfather. He picked me up -- 
Participant 1: 
Really?  Oh, picked you up.  I thought you meant flew with you. 
Participant 2: 
No, no.  Picked me up from the airport.  I’m staying at his house for 
a couple of days.  I kind of wandered around like a zombie the first 
day.  I was running around everywhere.  And my girlfriend from New 
Zealand traveled with me.  She’s trying to find a job at the moment 
for a family in Ireland.  We looked around first week wondering

where I’m going.  We’re in England, my God, they have this brand of 
chips and everything’s in pounds and they talk funny and very 
things cool. We’re the biggest tourists ever.  
Participant 1: 
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It’s cool, it’s cool.  I remember like when I fly back 
and forth from the states to here, I don’t really get overtired.  But I 
remember flying to Sydney was like the most, it was just, well I flew 
from the East Coast of America to L.A. and then to Sydney all in one 
stint.  And it was like 30 hours or something like that.  
Participant 2: 
That’s a bit much. 
Participant 1: 
Yeah, by the time you get there, you’re just walking around like a 
zombie state half the time.   
Participant 2: 
Plus in Sydney, it’s like I’m not sure if you’ve ever been to Singapore, 
but as soon as you get out of the door and the heat knocks you off.   
Participant 1: 
Yeah, same with Sydney.   
Participant 2: 
You just want to run back into the airport and hide.   
Participant 1: 
I know how it is.  It’s intense.  It’s that, like when you get into a 
conversation with somebody in the same way. Right? When you’re 
talking to somebody and you’ve had that no sleep for 36 hours and 
they’re talking to you and do you ever get that feeling where it’s like 
gravity is pushing down on you, on your head and shoulders?  You 
know what I’m talking about?  Do you feel that?  It’s almost like 
heaviness.  It’s not actually like tired or anything; it’s just that 
heaviness that you feel when somebody is talking to you.  And like, 
they’re talking to you but you’re paying more attention to that 
feeling that’s happening inside of your head right now than you are 
actually to what they’re saying.   
You notice other things around you like the sounds of a room and 
the way that your head is tilted or your body is sitting on a chair.  
And you can just relax and think about why you might have changed 
what you changed because you continue to listen instead of what 
the person is saying but not even really realizing what they are 
actually saying.  And not being sure really how much sense it’s 
making as you laugh at what they’re saying on the inside.   
And you continue to just focus on that.  Checking all the things 
around you, like the sounds and the feelings, the tilt of your head,

which might move or it might go back depending on how you feel.  
And as you just think about those people that who are all, lost my 
rhythm.  And as you just think about those people that who are all 
around you right now, ever have that like kind of existential moment 
where you’re like you’re so broad inside yourself, maybe it’s from 
being overtired or something and you just think about the idea that 
you’re a human being having your own thoughts and like all these 
other people are having their thoughts around you.  And it’s like this 
whole world is like just a perception with all these different people. 
Do you ever get lost in kind of an existential spiral like that thinking 
about those kinds of things?  Maybe sometimes?   
Participant 2: 
Yeah.   
Participant 1: 
That can be weird.  So when people do that, when people think like 
that, they start to get more focused inside and find themselves 
maybe feeling more in the moment, more in the present moment, 
more in the now.  Maybe you’ve heard that before and you start to 
focus on the feelings that you’re having instead of the things that 
are happening or happened in the past or might happen in the 
future because the present moment is really the only thing that 
there is.  I mean, we are here and it is now and as we swallow, we 
think about that.  And you just remember that all the things that are 
happening to your body now have been always happening and will 
continue to happen as long as you’re alive.   
But as you feel good about that now, you can begin to allow yourself 
to relax more and more.  And the further you look forward into the 
future, the more you can feel your body coming alive.  And the 
more you feel your body coming alive, the more you notice things 
getting bigger, things spacing out, breaths getting wider, the more 
you allow yourself to just go further and further into the future 
seeing more and more finding yourself more and more relaxed.  
Because the more we look forward and allow ourselves to feel 
relaxed now, the more comfortable we can become.  That’s right.   
All those signs that you know as a hypnotist need to become more 
and more relaxed.  So you can allow yourself to just keep going 
forward, deeper, forward, that’s right.  And as you allow yourself to 
continue to breathe and let that distance in your vision to continue 
forward, you can find yourself drifting closer to that place that’s so 
familiar.  Where you know you’re going anyway.  Where the heat

and time will take you, as it takes you, you’re a little bit tired, that’s 
right.  Just allowing yourself to drift down and out, closer, and more 
relaxed, finding that great feeling, to become part of you.  That’s 
right, that’s right.  Deeper and deeper.   
That relaxation to that place where you’re drifting forward into time 
wondering where you’re traveling to next.  Wondering where you’ll 
be.  Wondering what it feels like inside your body.  Walking from 
country to country, crossing borders as a tourist, soaking it all in.  
The different currencies you’re finding.  The different experiences 
and how your feet feel on all the different pavements and grounds 
throughout all the different parts of the worlds.  All the sounds 
around you, like when you’re in a public place and there’s sounds all 
around you and so many conversations.  But they all just kind of 
melt into one giant sea of sounds of human beings like you are 
inside.   
As you become more relaxed remembering how that feels.  And 
realizing the more you pay attention to how you feel inside, the 
more you’re reminded that you are a human being just like all 
human beings.  So as you start to bring yourself back to the room, 
to the training today, you can start to sit back in your chair and start 
breathing deeper.  Stretching your arms and opening your eyes, 
feeling great.  Igor gave me the 30 second head start.   
Participant 2: 
It’s good.   
Participant 1: 
You like it.  Cool, cool.   
Participant 2: 
The intensity was really compelling.
