How are you doing today? 
Good.
Now that’s what I like to hear. Who slept well last night? A little bit tired, 
perhaps? 
Yes.
You can see why we call it the boot camp, right? So who’s feeling like 
they’re a proper hypnotist now? Good because tomorrow you’re going to 
show us. We’re going to do the show. Rest assured today we’re going to be 
focusing very hard on making sure that you’re ready to do that show. You’re 
going to do a great job. 
One of the things we’re going to be doing is we’re going to make it easy for 
you to do a short show in a short amount of time so you feel like you have 
all the time in the world. Wouldn’t that be something? 
I don’t know about you guys, but who drives a car here? Remember the first 
time you were on a freeway. I remember the first time I went on the 
motorway, which is the equivalent in the U.K. Everything was zooming past 
me 100 mph, and I’m going like an old lady. I hated going on the motorway 
because of that. 
Then one day I decided, you know what? I’m a hypnotist. I should feel the 
changes. So I go on the motorway and I go straight for the fast lane, which 
was a little risky for me. Don’t do this at home, kids. I was just talking to 
myself – okay, you’re cool, calm and confident. 
Eventually, what happened was – because you’re in the fast lane anyway, 
so no one really comes in and out because it’s just one lane. So you’re kind 
of climatized, right? The strangest thing happened. I was going to a course 
at the time, so I was driving for like an hour and a half each day there and 
back. 
Maybe it was the second or third trip, something like that, and I suddenly 
realized that where I was coming off the motorway, off the freeway to the 
regular roads and back to regular speeds, everyone was like crawling 
along.

It was like oh man, come on. I was like one of those really annoying drivers, 
beeping at everyone, yelling get out of the way and changing lanes four 
times just to ahead of one car, right? They were all going way too slow for 
me. 
That’s kind of what I’d like to do with you guys today if that’s okay with you. 
I’d like to speed up your brains, so when we end up doing a five-minute 
show that seems tediously slow to you, but perfectly paced to the rest of the 
world. Would that be something worth doing?
Yes.
What I want to do first, is just grab your chairs and put yourselves into your 
12 groups, the ones we organized yesterday. Go and do that now, and then 
we’ll start.
So let’s double check, has everyone got a group of three people? Yes?
Yes.
Are we good? All right. Excellent! You are going to love this, and hate me of 
course. Do you remember the seven-step little mini formula that we did in 
terms of a show?
1. Your Intro
2. Your call for volunteers
3. A quick test
4. An induction
5. The Big Band
6. One main routine
7. Finishing up
Do you remember all that? You may want to stand up. Actually, you can sit 
down if you want for this. Just get into groups of three and get nice and tight 
because you’re going to need it. Make sure you get nice and tight. Agree 
who is going to be the hypnotist first, second and third because you’re all 
going to be taking turns.
Please let me know when you know who’s going to be first, second and 
third. One of you needs to be sitting in front because you’ll be the hypnotist 
– or standing in front. 
All right, folks. Are you all ready? Let’s have the first hypnotists up and 
ready. Here’s what we’re going to do. There will be no music for this and 
you’ll see why in a moment, because it might get confusing. In your groups 
of three, you now have one minute, 60 seconds, to do an entire show from 
start to finish.

That means there is not a single moment to waste. No wasted words, no 
wasted action. You have to get in there, do your thing and get out because 
when 60 seconds are up, the next person is up and I am not waiting. You’ll 
be eating up their time. Does that make sense?
Yes.
Are you guys ready? Don’t worry about timing. You have these seven steps 
to finish within 60 seconds:
1. Your Introduction
2. Your call for volunteers
3. Test for the rest of the group
4. Induction with everyone
5. Big Bandstand for a while
6. One simple main routine, an individual routine
7. Finish up. Bring them back and cancel all suggestions
So there’s no music.
There will be no music because that will confuse you at this point. All right, 
is everyone ready for this? Is everyone ready for this?
Yes!
All right, let’s go. Time starts now!

In a minute, we’ll do the same exercise we did yesterday, only this time you 
have a bigger group. You have a proper little stage show going on here, 
right? You’re going to come in, you’re going to introduce yourself, you’re 
going to allow volunteers to come on stage, you’re going to do a test and 
get more volunteers and you’re going to put inductions on the four people 
you’ve got as volunteers.
Then, if you want to get rid of some people because you don’t like them, 
send them back. So take more people than you want. Then you’ll do the Big 
Band, remember the playing instruments thing. Then you’ll do one other 
simple routine – forget their name, change name, alien language or 
whatever else you want to do and then we’re going to end, all within five 
minutes.
We’ll be cueing the music. Guys, you just did a show in one minute. Come 
on. This will seem like forever now. You’re doing exactly what you just did
only you have five times as much time. It’s easy. And you’ve got the board 
right here to help you. And we’ve got the music right there to help you. This 
is a no brainer. 
Are you guys ready? 
Yes.
All right, folks. Your time starts now!
And that’s it, folks. That’s everything. Give yourselves a round of applause.
Applause
How do you guys feel? 
Great.
Who feels like a real stage hypnotist now? By the way, we promise you’ll be 
doing one show in Vegas. Actually, you’re doing repeat performances you 
realize that, right?
Okay you guys. We’ve run over a little bit but, hopefully, it was worth it for 
you guys. You had a good experience of a show. What we’re going to do 
now is for the next part of the afternoon, it’s going to be relatively 
straightforward. You should still have plenty of energy because we don’t be 
doing that much, in terms of content and in terms of performance.

We’ll come back and we’ll start designing the show that you will be doing on 
Sunday, tomorrow. So we’ll come back and we’ll show you step-by-step 
how to design your show. If you want to use what you just did now as a 
template, that’s fine. If you want to actually go into some of the stuff, that’s 
fine too. I’ve seen a lot of you guys starting to invent inductions, invent 
suggestion tests and invent skits. That’s perfect. That’s exactly where you 
need to be. 
I’m very proud of you all. I hope you’re proud of yourselves. Let’s just take a 
15-minute break. Be back here in 10 minutes because there’s a lot of other 
content we’re going to cover, and we don’t want to be sliding too much on 
the time. All right, folks? Have a good day!
Applause
All right, folks. How are you doing?
Great.
Are we spreading further back. There seems to be a few empty chairs here. 
Everyone else is like, no there’s nobody hiding in the toilet. Oh my God, it’s 
getting to crunch time. How are you guys doing?
Great.
Are you learning some stuff.
Yes!
Doesn’t Don really know his stuff when it comes to stage hypnosis? The 
whole business and the back end? I think it’s important for you to realize 
this, because it would be unfair of us to give you a stage hypnosis course 
and promise you all these great riches are possible – which by the way, 
they are.
But, it would be unfair to do that without giving you a solid understanding of 
just how much effort you have to do in the background to set it up in the first 
place. It won’t just fall in your lap. Some people will be lucky. Maybe your 
area just happens to be the place that has just been waiting for it, but for 
most of us, you’ll have to go out there and promote yourself. You’ll have to 
create a business out of this. 
There is a lot of business stuff involved. Hopefully, you found that talking 
about all the back end stuff, the safety stuff, what to do if someone freaks 
out on stage stuff, the setup stuff and really just the business element of it 
have all been worthwhile.

The Promo Show
Igor:
What I want to do now is have a look at the anatomy of a stage show, so 
you can actually start preparing your own show. You’re going to have nine 
minutes to do a show. Let me warn you here, at nine minutes and one 
second, the following thing is going to happen. At nine minutes and one 
second, the next hypnotist that’s waiting in the wings will be pushed on, and 
if you haven’t finished yet, he will finish your show for you and start his own.
So you really need to keep track of time. The only reason I’m saying this is 
most of you guys were easy. I mean you did a five-minute show with no 
problem at all. Some of you got your 30-second warning and what did you 
do then? Okay, now let’s do one more skit, quickly. 
When you get your 30-second warning – actually, it will be a one-minute 
warning. We’ll talk about that in a second. When you get your one-minute 
warning, what you’re looking to do is not start something new, but finish 
whatever is happening right now as elegantly as possible so you then can 
clear their minds and send them back to their chairs. 
If your show is only eight minutes long, you’re not going to fired by anyone. 
It’s perfect. Even if your show is just seven and a half minutes, it’s still fine. 
It’s just that if your show is nine minutes and one second, then someone 
else will be coming up here to finish it for you. You really don’t want that to 
happen, right?
So to avoid that happening, here’s what we’re going to do. Can I get rid of 
this page? Okay. You’re going to have nine minutes of show. So what we’re 
going to be doing is for eight minutes we’re going to pretty much leave you 
alone. You can have whatever music you want and so on. We’ll talk about 
the logistics of that in a moment.
At the end of the eighth minute, Mark over here has a very bright flashlight, 
an led light. Don’t worry, he won’t be lighting you unless you are ignoring 
the whole warning thing. Then like the last 30 seconds he’ll blind you with 
the light. We might have to resort to that. Really, all we’re going to be doing 
is just imagine the room is kind of soft low lighting. You can’t really see the 
back of the room or the exit very well because the lighting is relatively low.
Then if somewhere during your show this bright light just jumps up at the 
back of the room behind the camera, so it won’t disturb your promo video, if 
a bright light lights up and you see it, don’t go what the hell is that? I don’t 
know, let’s ignore it. That is your one-minute warning.

8
                                 
Here’s my strong recommendation. Whether you follow it or not is entirely 
up to you. I strongly recommend that when that flashlight goes on, whatever 
you’re doing find a way of elegantly finishing it up. The simplest way is just 
say that’s right, now sit down and sleep! Then start clearing the suggestions 
and bring them back. That way you have a nice thunderous applause at the 
end of your promo DVD as well, which is a good thing. Send them back into 
the audience with thunderous applause. That is what I recommend you do. 
That will be the drill to go for, that way you’ll be assured to have a very 
clean and very professional looking show for the DVD. Just to emphasize 
this so there’s no misunderstanding on the day, at nine minutes and one 
second, someone else will come up and will finish the show for you. If you 
don’t want that to happen, well, you know what to do.
Are we okay with this? The reason I’m saying this – I don’t want to be a 
time Nazi on this, but if we don’t do this, there are a lot of people in this 
room and we’ll be here until 10:00 p.m. It’s very easy to start running over, 
and we just can’t afford to do that, partly because at 10:00 p.m., there’s 
going to be no motivation left in the crowd to have a good video for whoever 
is at the end of the day. That’s unfair to the people who are at the end of the 
day. Make sense?
Does that mean by nine minutes, everybody should be off the stage for the 
next one to start?
That’s what we’re aiming for all right?
That’s everybody off the stage?
Somewhere between the eighth or ninth minute, I want the show to finish 
and be going back. If you’re finishing right on the second of nine minutes, 
and they’re starting to move off at that point, we’re not going to stop the 
show and yell, you cheated! You’ll have a little bit of slush time, but it’s 
literally, in the second’s category, rather than the minutes. 
So your aim should be between minutes eight and nine to wrap up what 
you’re doing, dehypnotize your subjects, send them back into the audience 
with a thunderous applause, take your bow and, if you can do so, walk off 
all within that 60-second segment. 
It’s not tricky to do. I mean you guys have done five-minute shows already. 
So you can do it pretty well. In fact, I saw a few of you sneaking it in 
because when the music went off, you went oh bugger. All right, quick, 
sleep! Suggestions leave. Get out!
Would it be a recommendation to maybe shoot for seven minutes and get 
off early.

Sure. We’ll talk about timings in a second when we go through the anatomy 
of a stage show, and we’ll help you plan that timing so you don’t run over. 
Let’s put it this way, if your show is five minutes and you finish up on the 
sixth minute, you still have a really good promo tape, right? If it’s seven 
minutes, that’s fine too. It’s just that at the eight minute market, when you 
see that light basically, then you go, okay I’ve had my eight minutes. I’ll just 
gracefully bow out and finish it up.
A minute is more than enough time to finish a show. It’s more than enough 
time, so you shouldn’t feel time pressured. Just make sure you see that 
light. Look for it, and when it comes, you go, okay, time’s up. Whatever plan 
I had in my head is out the window now. I’m just going to finish the show.
Won’t the music be kind of a cue where we’re at in the show?
We’ll talk about the music as well, and rest assured, somewhere between 
the eight and nine minute mark, whatever music you’re playing will be 
turned off and we’ll have the exit music. That will be the other cue. Like the 
last 30 seconds is, basically, finishing up music.
Are you guys cool so far?

Let’s start breaking down the anatomy of a stage show purely and simply so 
you know how to put together what you’ll be doing tomorrow. Let me just 
keep an eye on the time here so we don’t run over too much for you guys. 
Okay, good.
So, you basically, did all of this today already. Do you remember how to do 
an Intro? Let me try this again. Who knows how to do an Intro?
Yes!
Do you know how to call for volunteers?
Yes!
Do you know how to test the rest of your audience for more volunteers?
Yes!
Do you know how to do a quick induction. I mean a quick induction?
Yes!
Do you know how to do a warm-up, like the band or the drunk or anything 
like that?
Yes!
Do you know how to do a main routine, like forgetting a name or speaking 
in an alien tongue or anything like that?
Yes!
Do you know how to end a show, clear the suggestions and send them 
back to the audience to thunderous applause?
Yes!
You know how to do a show in that case. I think so.
Applause
So let’s break this down in terms of times because time is of the essence 
when we’re coming to the show. Here’s my recommendation. You do not 
have to follow this. If you want, you can spend eight minutes putting 

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
11
                                 
someone in trance and one minute sending them back, if you want. I don’t 
recommend it. It’s not going to make much of a show, but you can do it.
What I recommend you do is you spend:
Three minutes to do your setup.
I mean three minutes on your Introduction, your call for volunteers, your 
testing of the rest of the audience for more volunteers and your induction.
If you can keep this whole section in three minutes or less, you’re in great 
shape because now you have five minutes to do a show. Does that make 
sense? You could do this in two minutes, in which case more power to you. 
Then you have six minutes to do a show. Do you see how that works?
Let’s assume you take three minutes to do the whole Intro section. Then 
you have:
Five minutes to do the show.
One minute to finish the show.
Just so you realize the Intro is also part of your show, right? People will be 
excited by this whole section. It’s part of the mystique. I’m just talking in 
terms of, shall we say, trade lingo, this is the actual bit you get paid for. 
You did an entire show from beginning to end in five minutes, right? Most of 
you did one warm-up routine and maybe one or two main routines in that 
time isn’t that right including, of course, all the setup and so on. So what I 
recommend you think about doing in this section here, which is your five-
minute section, is keep it to about three or four routines tops. 
In other words, you want to do two warm-ups, like getting drunk at the 
beach and then maybe follow that up with the band. Then do one, shall we 
say, longer routine, which is like the main routine, like forgetting a name or 
something like that. That’s pretty much it. 
If you’re racing through one of these because you’ll be in control of your 
time at this point and you might find yourself having done two warm-ups 
within a minute, so you still have four minutes left and you have some time 
to play, have two or three main routines open to you. 
Aim to do one warm-up and two main routines or two warm-ups and one 
main routine. Then have two or three main routines in the back of your mind 
as extras that you’ll just throw in there if you feel like it. Does that make 
sense?

Student:
Igor:
I don’t even know why I’m asking this question. I’m sure you’re going to 
cover it, but how are they going to know back there if we get done with the 
session quicker, faster?
Very simple. You’ll do something like this. It’s a very subtle hypnotic trick. 
What you’ll be doing is this; we’re going to have three people in your show; 
two people supporting you. There will be people in your group. You’ll be 
choosing them very shortly. So in your group of six people, you might just 
split into two groups of three and play it that way if you want, or whatever 
you want to do. I don’t mind. 
You’re going to have one stage manager. You’re going to have one DJ. 
You’re going to have one hypnotist. Of course, your roles will rotate as we 
go through the shows. 
Your stage manager’s job is to do two simple things:
1. Make sure you’re standing in the wings ready to go on stage two 
minutes before your show begins.
So, when you see that light in the background, your stage manager should 
be going, where the hell is my hypnotist? You should be grabbing him and 
saying, it’s your turn to be here. As a stage manager, you must know when 
your hypnotist is coming on stage because it’s your job to keep him ready to 
go on stage. 
Does that make sense? Of course, hypnotists, it’s in your best interest to be 
ready too. 
2. The stage manager’s role is to introduce the hypnotist.
Remember, we talked about this just a moment ago with Arthur? He’ll be off 
stage with a mic in his hand and he’ll say, ladies and gentlemen, please 
welcome the world’s most amazing hypnotist, Arthur. Does that make 
sense?
So the stage manager will make sure you get on and do the whole show 
and so on. Meanwhile, the next stage manager is cueing up and the next 
hypnotist, etc.
The DJ will be in the back of the room with a little iPod. We’ve cued up all 
the music and, as the hypnotist, you will have discussed with the DJ ahead 
of time, here are the five skits I have in mind. I want to do these three for 
sure, and maybe I’ll do these two as well. Here are the numbers of the 
music I want to go with them. You have the musical sheet with them right 
now, the white one. Is this one here? Thank you very much.

You will notice that the sheet has the names of skits and a number. The DJ 
will only work with the numbers because the names on the actual sound 
tracks are different from the names of the skits. We haven’t renamed them, 
but the numbers are the same. 
So what you do is, let’s say you want to use getting drunk as your warm-up; 
you want to use the World’s Sexiest Spy as your main routine; and you 
want to use The Hottest Disco Dancer as another main routine, all right? 
Number three, by the way, is the Luckiest Day in the World, which is what I 
recommend you use as your general holding music. 
It’s the music you’re playing in the background, while nothing else is going 
on. Like when you come on stage that will be playing. When your 
volunteers are coming up, that will be playing; if you have a routine that 
hasn’t got any music for it, that will be playing in the background. You’ll 
recognize it because you’ve been hearing it all day.
So you’ll come on stage and number three is playing. So the DJ has 
number three on his list. Then, the next time you point at him – or you might 
even do a little finger signal or something like that. Just go three or five or 
whatever it is. He’ll start playing getting drunk. So you’re on stage, you’re 
doing your demo, you’ll want number seven, which is the hypnotic induction 
music that’s the music you’ll play during the induction. 
Please come up on stage. Everyone goes yay. Then everyone sleep- sleep-
sleep- sleep, sleep. Number seven starts playing. You do your induction, 
which means you’ll go right back to either the basic music, if you want that, 
or let’s say you’re going to be doing Big Bandstand or because his list will 
have number 5 written on it, you’ll go to number 5 and start playing that. 
When you’ve had enough of this, then you’ll go like this, or you’ll just pause 
and put them back to sleep. Then you’ll do a skit, maybe without music or 
maybe with just the background music. Then when you have another skit, 
like The Hottest Disco Dancer, so you’ll hold up however many fingers, and 
they’ll start playing the music, you’ll do your thing and then you’re done.
Here’s how I recommend you do this:
Track 3 is for general music. 
It’s just a happy, vibrant upbeat tune, and you’ve all had a chance to listen 
to this at lunch. This is Track 3. You should be familiar with this by now. 
You’ve been hearing it a lot. I recommend you use this as your general 
background track when there’s no other music going on. Even it’s just very 
quiet, it sets a little bit of atmosphere, rather than having silence.
Track 7 is your induction music.

14
                                 
Do you want to play number 7 briefly. It sounds like hypnotic music, right? 
So whether you play it for 30 seconds or for eight minutes, it’s up to you. 
Just remember, you only have eight minutes. 
After that, you just choose whichever sound tracks fit what you want. 
If you haven’t got a sound track yet that fits whatever skit you’re trying to 
do, then just go right back to the general music in the background as an 
atmospheric filler whilst you do whatever else you’re doing. 
If there is something specific, like A Day at the Races or anything like that, 
you just choose that. What they’ll be doing is they’ll have a list like this, and 
it will have 3, 7, 5, 4, 3 on it. So they’ll start with 3. Then you’ll say 7, they’ll
play it and then you’ll do this again and he’ll play this one. You’ll do that 
again, and they’ll play this one. Then if you want to change, instead of 
having 3 at the end you’ve decided, you know what? I’m going to risk it, I 
now want to have a Big Stripper routine, then you’ll whisper, I want 16 and 
hope to God that he understands you. 
Of course, the easier way of doing it is to say to him, at this point, I may 
need number 4 or 5. So if I do this signal, do 4; if I do this signal, you’ll play 
5, or whatever. My advice though, is to keep it simple. Start with the general 
music, go to the induction, do one or two pieces of music that fit whatever 
skits you’re doing. Keep them in order. Just flow with it. 
If something comes up that you want to use that has nothing to do with this, 
just give a general signal, something like this, and make sure that your DJ 
knows that when you do this, you basically mean go back to the general 
music. So either they go through your list or they go to the general music. 
It’s a very simple way of keeping track of things. Does that make sense?
Thank you very much.
You’re very welcome. Can we have a microphone up front here? Please 
stand up a second to ask your question.
Are we going to have any kind of microphones? 
You will have a microphone. In fact, you’ll be wearing one like I’m wearing, 
and you’ll have one of those hand-helds as well to play with the audience if 
you want. Do not give it to your volunteers. Hold it for them. There will be 
another one for your manager to introduce you. In fact, chances are he’ll 
introduce you and then give it to you and you’ll walk on stage with it, that 
way we’ll keep track of the mics.
Number 20, the exit music– is that the one you’ve been playing for our one-
minute warning?

Yes. We can use the exit music for that if you want, or you can choose your 
own exit music. It’s entirely up to you. Let me just make this very clear. This 
is your show. You can do with it what you want. The only interference I’m 
going to provide is that at nine minutes and one second, someone else is 
coming up on that stage whether you like it or not. In between, honestly, if 
you want to stand there and strip, that’s your problem. I don’t care. You can 
do that. 
You can run your show exactly how you want. These are just suggestions 
to make it run more smoothly and more easily for you. Does that make 
sense?
If you want to have that music, use it. If you don’t, I’m totally fine with that 
too. We’ll come to you in a second. We have one up here first.
So you had said that everybody’s going to pick their DJ and their manager. 
So we all may be a DJ as well? 
Everyone will be a DJ. Everyone will be a manager. Rest assured what will 
happen is both Matt and his wife, Sherri, have been back there doing all the 
music for us during the whole event. So they’ll be sitting right by your side 
as the DJ. 
You don’t have to be a DJ if you don’t want to, but I strongly recommend 
that you do. Why? Because once you know what it feels like for a DJ to do 
your music, you’ll know how to train them when it comes to doing your 
show. 
You may as well have that experience and you’ll know what mistakes they 
can make because you might make them as well. But you’ll have either 
Matt or Sherri sitting by your side to coach you through the whole process, 
and that way you can coach someone else and train them to respond to 
your signals in real life too. 
Make sense?
Yes. Thanks.
I was just wondering what music you recommended during the main part, 
when you’re trying to have the people forget.
Again, you can use anything for the music. We’ll give you a list of sketches 
that fit that music specifically; however, if in doubt, if you don’t know what 
music will fit something, just go with number 3 – the general music.

16
                                 
This is your default that I would recommend. Can you play this one again, 
Matt, number three. This is the general music they can play in the 
background whenever you don’t have anything else to do it’s just that happy 
upbeat music. 
So if somebody is speaking in alien tongue, will they be able to hear it over 
that?
You can tell your DJ how loud you want it. Just tell them. I want it quiet. It’s 
your show. You’re in charge. 
For time’s sake, will there be more than the one-minute warning, or will it 
just be that? I mean in order for you to keep track of the time, will there 
be…
Oh, you want to have more than the one-minute warning? Is that what 
you’re saying?
Yeah, is that possible?
Sure. What we can do is make little signs up – I’m not sure how well they’ll 
be visible – but we can have little signs that say, you have five minutes left; 
three minutes left and then the light goes on. Would you like that?
Yes!
So we’ll just make sure that we have assistants in the back. The first three 
minutes we can ignore and then we’ll go 5, 4, 3, 2 lights on and you’re off. 
The big hook will come and drag you off the stage. All right, is everyone 
good?
Yes.
Is everyone happy?
Yes.
So there are couple of things we’ll be doing now. The first thing is we’re 
going to be going to a break in about 10 minutes or so. On your break, I 
want you to start chatting to people in your group who will be your manager, 
and who will be your DJ. Select that because after the break, we’re going to 
start putting together your own skit, your own show and starting to rehearse 
it. Does that make sense to you? 
Get together in your groups, maybe have your break together, go pee 
together, unless you want to hold hands, I don’t know. Your manager will do 
your introduction for you.

Wait a second. Don’t start doing this now. We’re not done yet. Find your 
manager, find your DJ and just make sure they agree with you. In the next 
session, you can pick your music, pick your routines and everyone knows 
what’s going on. 
Sperling, are you still with us? Sperling stay with us, stay with us. There you 
go. 
I assume that both the manager and the DJ should not be people who go 
just before you and just after you.
That would be very helpful. You know what order you’re in now, so you 
should be able to manage that relatively straightforwardly. Here’s what 
we’re going to do now. You understand the basic outline of a show, right?
Right.
You understand the very important timing that you’re going to be limited to. 
You have a sheet of music so you can choose music to follow the skits that 
you want. 
Right.
So what I recommend you do is when we break up in about 30 seconds 
time, find people in your group that you want to be your manager or your DJ 
and have dinner with them. Over dinner, I want you to start discussing how 
you want your show to run. Maybe just have dinner as a group and figure 
out who’s doing which role for whom. Then start throwing backwards and 
forwards ideas for what you want to do, how you want to run your show, 
what music might fit that and so on.
So when you come back after dinner you’ll have at least half a plan of what 
you want to do. Now here’s a hint. If you do not know what you want to do, 
if you’re like, I don’t know, this all could be possible, then make life easy 
and stick with that five-minute show you did earlier today, and just expand it 
a little bit. Just make a little bit more out of that. You have it under your belt 
already. You’ve already done it.
Otherwise, if you want to experiment with things and try new things out and 
so on, just do that. Does that make life easy for you guys?
Yes.
All right, let’s be back here at 7:20 to start at 7:30 on the dot. Sound good?
Yes!

1-Minute Rehearsals
Igor:
Believe it or not, your seminar, your course finishes today. The seminar will 
finish today in about an hour or so’s time because tomorrow, I don’t want 
you to turn up to these rooms as students. I want you to turn up as 
professional stage hypnotists who have been engaged to do a gig, and 
that’s exactly what you’re going to do because you will be. 
As far as I’m concerned, right now guys, you’ve passed. You’ve passed the 
course. You’ll get your certificates. Do you know why? Because I saw you 
do a show. I saw every one of you do a kick-off show in here earlier today. 
Sure, it was only five minutes, but it was a full blown show. 
Now I’m not going to suggest to you that it’s that easy when you go out in 
the real world because sometimes things come up, but the point is, that’s 
your basic pattern. If things start happening in the middle of it, well, you just 
deal with it and you get back to your basic pattern. This is easy to do, isn’t 
it?
You can do each of these steps, right? Hopefully, that gives you a lot of 
peace and comfort in terms of what you’ll be doing tomorrow because if 
anything else goes wrong, do you know what you do? You do exactly the 
same thing you did today. You go, oh I fumbled, ah sleep! All right, big 
band, and you’re done. 
So that’s always there in the back of your mind. We spent a lot of time 
drilling that in because you’ll always have a default to fall back on. Now the 
more experienced you get, the more shows you do you’ll be experimenting 
with different routines, you’ll get to like some routines and so on. Great!
Then your defaults become larger and larger until eventually you can pretty 
much handle any situation without thinking about it.
You’re not there yet. You need some experience for that. So what I’d like to 
do today is get yourselves into groups of three. Most of you are in a group 
of six, so just take the group and split yourself in half. Those of you who 
have a group of five – where’s the group of five again? If you guys grab 
Debra in the back here and so you’ll have one group of three and a group of 
two. Just grab Debra as the third person. 
What I want you to do is just run through this structure using your own 
show, whatever routines you’re thinking of. Make sense? We’re going to do 
it in a couple of ways. The first way we’re going to do it is just a one-minute 
version of whatever show you had in mind, a one-minute version. Why? 
We’re going to just do a couple of those cycles, just so you get the 
connections between things together. 

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
19
                                 
Then you’ll get an opportunity to do the whole show in its full nine-minute 
length so you can test yourself in terms of how the timing flows. That’s 
pretty much the rest of the day. 
So you’ll first get your show under your belts, so you understand who it 
flows. Then you’ll test yourself for times, making sure that no one else 
comes and steals the show from you at the end of it. Then, we’re good to 
go, aren’t we? Is there anything else that’s really left over? 
When you say do the show in one minute, what words are you referring to?
I’m talking about the whole thing. You’ll try to do the show in one minute. 
You’re going to do the whole lot in one minute. It means either you become 
a very fast talker, or you cut out all that stuff that you really don’t need. Your 
induction will be an instant one. Your warm-up routine will be for 10 
seconds. Your main routine will be for 10 seconds. Your Introduction will be 
five seconds, if that. This little test here will not take more than 10 seconds. 
Now, of course since it’s just a minute, your partners will be play acting 
along with you just to give you the feel for it. The important thing is that you 
get the experience of your show all the way through so you know how it fits 
together. Make sense? Then we’ll do it together as a longer piece to get the 
feel of the time. 
Can we run the music and get trained on the equipment?
The simple answer is no. I don’t mean to be flippant about it. It’s just 
because we have one iPod and there are 80 of you.
If the person is doing their spot where they’re explaining instructions and 
talking to people while they’re sitting down, if the music is too loud, are the 
sound people going to take it down a bit so they can hear them or is it going 
to be a steady volume?
That’s your call as a hypnotist. You tell your DJ how loud you want it. Just 
get some signals. I would recommend you just have three basic signals. 
1. Next track.
2. Whatever you’re doing, stop it or go to the default track, which in my 
opinion should be number three.
3. Make it louder or make it quieter. 
They’re not really crazy signals, are they? They’re very simple ones, like 
bring it up a little bit, bring it down a little bit, go to the default track or kill the 
track or just go to the next track. It’s simple and everyone knows what 
they’re doing. All right? Is everyone cool?

Any questions? All right, please split into your 12 groups. When you’re 
ready, please look at me so we can start you off on your timings. 
Now once you’re in your group of six, please split into two groups of three 
inside that group, but stay close together just because we’re on the same 
space in a minute. So you guys all in groups of three now, yes?
Yes.
All right. In your group of three, please name yourselves off 1, 2 and 3 all 
right. Do all of you have a hypnotic number – 1, 2 or 3. Yes? 
Yes.
So you all know what turn you’re taking, right?
Yes.
Okay, I’d like to have hypnotist number 1 up in front of the other two. Get 
ready to rock and roll. Okay, hypnotist number 1, your minute starts now!

Show Confidence
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
So the first question is who feels like they know their show much better 
now? Who feels like they’re completely lost at sea? A couple of you are lost 
at sea? If you feel at this stage that your show is maybe a little bit more 
complex than you had originally thought, here’s my advice. Simplify it. 
What’s the easiest way to simplify it? Go back to what you know. 
Remember, this is only your first show. This is not how you’ll be doing the 
rest of the shows in your life. 
You want your first show just to be like, I’m going to go out there and do it 
and it’s done. It’s as simple as that. Now if on the day, you get inspired to 
try something different, great. You just give them the signal for general 
music, and you do something different. At least you’ll have a default to fall 
back on. Doesn’t that make sense to you guys?
So, those of you who’ve got a good feel for the show you’ve decided, that’s 
excellent. Those of you who do not, my strong recommendation is simplify 
it. Go with what you did earlier today. I saw you guys – I saw you, for 
example, do a fantastic show earlier. Yes, you young man. You thought you 
were doing what everyone else was doing, but you weren’t. You were doing 
some crazy stuff, and it was fun. 
The reason you might feel that you don’t know your show is purely and 
simply because you’re putting way too much pressure on yourselves. So 
here’s the most important lesson you might take away from the entire 
seminar. Are you ready for this? STOP IT! Just stop doing it. Just make it 
easy. 
For most people, when they see a show, a bad hypnotist is better than most 
good shows. Let me repeat that. Seeing a bad stage hypnotist for most 
everyday people is more exciting than seeing a great show somewhere 
else. So why make life hard for yourself? Go right back. Simplify it. 
Has everyone done a five-minute show today that they thought was easy to 
do, yes?
Yes.
What’s wrong with that? Once you can do a five-minute show, if you get 
inspired to try something else, great. If not, you know what? Even if you just 
do a five-minute show tomorrow, no one’s going to come up and shoot you, 
believe it or not. So, do a five-minute show, you’ll have a five-minute promo 
that looks great and that gives you confidence to do the next show a little bit 
longer and a little bit more and so on.

22
                                 
Does that make sense to you guys? So those of you who kind of got a little 
bit lost with your little show just now – put your hands up if you got lost in 
your show but feel better now? Do you have something to do now? Put your 
hand up if you’re still completely lost at sea. All right, you will be shot. 
All right, here’s what we’re going to do now. Folks, here’s what we’re going 
to do now. In the same groups you’re in – in other words, the group of 
three, you’re going to go through your entire show using the whole nine 
minutes that you have available.
I’ll be there for you. Would you like me to give you a three-minute warning 
and after that at every minute? Is that good for you guys? I’m going to give 
you a three-minute warning. When I give you the three-minute warning that 
means you should have finished the induction. That means you have five 
minutes left for your show. I will then give you a minute warning each time 
one minute passes. 
At five minutes, four minutes, three minutes, two minutes and one minute. 
When you get to the one minute, I believe that will be at eight minutes. I’ll 
say, you’re now getting close to being done. I’ll give you a warning that says 
eight minutes is up, you now have one minute to finish your show. So I’ll 
give you the finishing up time. 
Whatever you’re doing – let me re-emphasize this. Even if you’re in the 
middle of a routine, I strongly recommend you break the routine as if you 
meant to or you spend five seconds going, that was funny, well done, sleep! 
Then start finishing the show there and then. Don’t try to take it to the edge 
because otherwise you’re risking someone coming up and finishing your 
show for you, and you don’t want that, do you?
Just to recap, I’ll give you a three-minute warning, which means three 
minutes are up. Then I’ll give you a minute warning for the next five 
minutes, which means eight minutes will be up.
Then as soon as the eight minutes are up, I’ll remind you this is your eight-
minute warning, which means you’ll have 60 seconds to wrap up your 
show. When I say all stop, that’s when someone’s going to come on the 
stage, so you had be off it by then. 
Make sense? Everyone cool? Does everyone know what they’re doing?
Yes.
You’re doing it with the same three people you did a moment ago so that 
we all have a chance to do this tonight. So number 1, you’re up. We’ll be 
using no music today. 
Students:
Igor:

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
23
                                 
Folks, one more thing, may I have your attention please? We will not be 
using music tonight other than the general music we will not be using music 
today other than the general music. 
However, if you’re going to be using music tomorrow, make sure you give 
your queues at the appropriate time and pretend there’s a DJ there, taking 
your instruction.
Change music, go to default music, lift the volume or lower the volume. You 
may as well get used to that process as part of the show. Make sense? This 
is an extra complication and you may as well practice it now. 
Does everyone know what they’re doing? 
The first three minutes, is that music set for the first three minutes?
No. You can have whatever music you want. You can have whatever music 
you want anywhere in the show tomorrow. You decide it. If you can’t think 
of anything, use the same music through the entire show, and just keep it 
looping. That just makes life easy. If you do want to change music, that’s 
fine. If you don’t, that’s fine too.
My recommendation is you use the basic music all the way up to the test. 
You use the induction music for the induction. Then for these things here, 
you’ll either use the basic music or whatever fits your sketch, and that’s 
written up in your music notes. 
Make sense? 
We lost a person.
You lost a person? Is he under your chair? Oh, he’s lost his voice. All right, 
in which case, Matt can you rejoin them in a minute when we start again? 
You’ll have the same assistants. Does everyone have a group of three to 
work with? Say again? All right, you’re in good shape, that’s fine. 
Otherwise, we’re going to start mixing groups, and we don’t want to do that. 
All right, folks any other points, questions or anything like that? 
Stage hypnotist number 1, you’re up.

We have the last few minutes of golden wisdom to share with you. First,
how do you guys feel?
Great.
Go ahead and give yourselves a round of applause.
Applause
So a nine-minute show doesn’t seem so short after all, does it? It’s actually 
quite long, isn’t it? It will get easier as you have more fun up there as you 
get used to it. In the meantime, you could bill yourself as having the world’s 
fastest stage hypnosis show, literally. 
Literally, I am amazed at every one of you. This is awesome!
You guys rock. 
I have a few things here that I want to add for you guys, if you guys want to 
have an awesome promo tomorrow. I want you to think about this. I want 
you to take these, into consideration. Before I do a show, this is what I do. 
But before I get to that, what I want to see as a promoter, if I’m looking at a 
video, is this. For you guys, I want to see a brief Introduction, which is going 
to happen for the stage manager. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands 
together for Shawn, the great hypnotist. You come up there and people are
clapping. So they’re going to want to see that. 
Then they’re going to want to see a bit of an induction. Not so much the 
rapid, but they want to see people flopping over a little bit.
Then you can do some inductions and then we’ll have clips of the routine. 
This is what they want to see. 
At the end of it, they want to see a website, a web address, how to get a 
hold of you. They want contact information on there. 
At the beginning of the video, they’re going to want to see your name. Like 
mine is, Spencer the World’s Fastest Hypnotist. Then I go right into what 
I’m doing, and it ends up with my website and how to contact me. Take 
these into consider as you prepare for tomorrow.

The second thing is this. It’s very important. Get some sleep tonight. If you 
think you’re going to go out and party tonight and be fresh for tomorrow, 
you’re mistaken. This is Las Vegas so do yourself a favor, get some sleep 
tonight and be rested because tomorrow is going to be a long day, and you 
want to look your best. 
As far as looking your best, dress up tomorrow. Look like a stage hypnotist. 
Look good because first appearance is what’s going to sell you. If you don’t 
have something on you or in your room now that is useable, they’ve got 
some great stores upstairs. Go spend the money and invest in yourself. 
You’ve got one chance for these guys to look at you, and trust me they’re 
going to be looking. 
For every one promo pack they get from you, they get 100 from other 
people. We are a dime a dozen, folks. First impressions last, so dress 
sharp.
No booze tonight because you’ll wake up groggy. If you’re hung over, 
you’re not going to be your best. Save the party for tomorrow night when 
we’re done and we go to the other shows. Save it for then. You’ll have 
much more fun. I can’t stress this enough. I know you want to go out and 
party. Save it for tomorrow in a big celebration. 
Caffeine, don’t do the caffeine either, here’s why. If you have a sore throat –
does anybody in here have a sore throat? Let me tell you what to do. When 
you wake up in the morning, take a nice hot shower and steam yourself. If 
you have a steamer in your room, put your head over it and get your lungs 
filled up and get your throat clear. Drink hot tea decaf only. No caffeine. You 
don’t want anything that’s going to stimulate your vocal chords. This is a 
performer’s secret. 
If you’ve got a bad throat, put some lemon in your hot tea and some honey. 
That will coat your throat and get rid of the sore throat. If you have a sore 
throat, bring a hot mug with you tomorrow full of juice with lemon in it and 
some tea.
If you have to get little bags of tea to bring with you because your throat 
hurts, bring them with you. Suck it down before you do your performance. 
That’s a very important thing to do. 
No dairy products. No citrus, nothing that will cause phlegm and cause your 
throat to lock up or your nose to drip because it will happen. I’m giving you 
tips, man. This is what you need to do. This is going to be a very, very big 
day for you tomorrow. It’s a very important day. Seriously, do your very 
best.

Remember, if you don’t have your websites, get those taken care of so that 
you can get those to Mark so he can get those put on there.
One more thing that I encourage you to do – and there again, I want to 
strongly encourage you right now to pick up that CD for the mental 
programming for the stage hypnotist. If you want to do yourself a favor, 
begin to program yourself tonight and get yourself psyched up, ready and 
jacked up for tomorrow.
Listen to it tonight. Just plug it in and let it run two or three times. When you 
get up in the morning, play it again. I have been doing this day one. I listen 
to self-hypnosis tapes every single day. I’ve been a hypnotist for over 30 
years, doing this work for not that long but for quite a while, and I still listen 
to CDs every single day. If you go up to my room, I have an iPod and it’s 
loaded with MP3 self-hypnosis programs that I created for myself and other 
people.
I’m so used to my own voice, I drop. But I have a few of other people that I 
enjoy too. I even have one of his that I got for free. 
Free? There’s that word again. See, they’re on my side. 
But wait minute. You said sign up here, and you get a free one. 
Don’t remind me, okay? I’m having issues now as it is.
But I don’t listen to his as often as I listen to my own. 
They’re free too, aren’t they?
Yeah, they’re free too, but what can I say. So anyway, if you don’t have that 
program, do yourself a favor, get it and listen to it. Program your mind not 
just for tonight, but for the rest of your career. It will make a difference. 
Honestly. I still listen to self-hypnosis relaxation CDs. Mine, his and other 
people’s because they just make me feel good when I’m stressed and 
tensed out.

Take advantage of the technology. Use it. It’s there for a purpose. It’s to 
help you be on the top of your game. Tomorrow you need it. You need 
these ideas flowing and filtering through your mind, and you can do that 
best by relaxing into that moment.
That’s right.
Because it does happen naturally.
And it really doesn’t take a genius to work out.
It takes a very intelligent person.
How easy and natural it is…
To let go…
And trust…
The process…
of your unconscious…
Each time…
Now. 
Right now.
Developing its own rhythm.
And the things that you need to learn…
And trusting…
As you relax.
That you can breathe deeply…
As you go deeper and deeper…
And let go…
Into that feeling…

All cares…
All ideas…
All worries…
And return…
To the place of power…
A natural place…
Confidence…
Just you…
Competent…
Inside…
Powerful…
Just you…
The stage hypnotist…
Finding yourself…
Every time…
And you can just drift and naturally return to this place…
As you get on the stage…
It’s just you…
You’re anchored into that moment…
And just trust…
That when the music starts…
You come out…

Six minutes. An extra minute of fun…
Deeper and deeper…
Seven minutes…

Till you experiment just a little bit more…
The feeling…
Eight minutes…
It’s good…
It’s time…
You’re on top...

That flashing light in the background…
It’s in your mind…
Reminding you to finish the process you’re engaged in…
In every cell of your body…
Just finish the process you’re engaged in…
You are programmed…
Eight minutes. Finish the process you’re engaged in…
To be successful…
And it’s so easy to do…
You can do it with your eyes closed…
It’s so natural to do…
In your dreams…
It’s just you…
In your waking state...
And your new skills…
Doesn’t it feel good?
That feels so natural…
That you do it easily…
It’s like you’ve been doing it all your life…
And you really have…

It began with a dream…
Seven simple steps…
And now you’re here…
The first one is to introduce yourself and your show…
Here in Las Vegas…
That’s easy to do…
On stage…
Then call some volunteers up. Bring them to your chairs…
Bring them all up…
Do some suggestion experiments with the rest of the crowd…
And you will have fun with it…
More people coming up. The excitement building…
And it’s so easy to do…
You feel the thrill of excitement in the crowd…
Running through your veins…
And then you’re induction begins…
And you know how to do it…
So easy…
Effortlessly…
A trip to the beach…
There you go…
Drifting on a cloud…
Easily…
A golden sunshine…

A beautiful relaxing scene.
And there you have it…
And now relax deeply.
Floating and drifting…
Three minutes into the show now…
Images flowing through your mind…
Time for the first warm-up routine…
There you go…
It’s so easy to do…
You know how to move…
When you do the Big Band…
You know how to breathe…
Drunk and stoned at the beach…
You watch the people…
Driving cars…
You know what to do…
What are you going to do?
Who will you choose?
Watch it now…
Why did you choose them?
More importantly…
Because they are the best…
Enjoy it.

The main routine…
You know where to go…
The excitement building and building…
Here comes the next one…
The crowd can’t believe what’s happening…
Here it comes…
Your nerves transform…
Deep inside…
To exciting energy…
Feel it…
Thrilling the audience…
From the top of your head…
Like a bolt of electricity shining through everyone…
To the tip of your toes.
Standing on end.
There it is…
And there you are…
Just like you want to me…
Five minutes into the show…
Doesn’t that feel good?
Already amazing things are happening…
To know that you have…
Things you never thought you could do.

A stage hypnotist…
You, you’re the hypnotist…
And you take it with you…
They’re responding to you…
Tonight…
Your show…
In your dreams…
And the audience is laughing…
Dreams become reality…
Your show…
Your reality…
Inside…
They’re looking at you…
Lies the dream of your show…
They watch you…
Outside…
You are proud.
Is the expression of your dream…
You are confident…
Express your dream…
You are capable…

Even that twinkle in your eye…
There it is…
That the audience sees and loves.

Six minutes into your show…
You feed off of the energy…
How much fun is this?
All about you…

They are watching you. Here they come…
An idea might pop into your head...

You’re having fun.
Nobody knows more than you…
My God, this is fun.
The best thing ever…
You all pay me for this?
That’s insane…
Minute seven is running through…
But isn’t that what it’s all about?
Tried and tested routines…
It’s your dream…
Coming close to the end of the show…
It’s your ownership…
It’s yours…
You are the actor…
It all belongs to you…
You are the director…
It’s just for you.

Big dreams…
Time to finish up…
And you can sleep…
Whatever you’re doing…
Sleeping tonight…
Finish it up. Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep.
Easily, confidently, naturally….
All those routine suggestions just cancel…
Ah, here they are…
But the good ones, the positive suggestions…
You’ve studied…
The one for your well being, know the one inside you…
You’ve integrated them into your mind…
Will stay with you for the rest of your life…
You’ve integrated them into your body…
Those positive suggestions…
You’ve integrated them into your life…
Will stay with you the rest of your life…
You accept them…
Just the silly ones…

It’s everything you do on the outside…
And there it is…
Because I think when these people realize who they really are, they’re in for 
a pleasant surprise. Don’t you think?
I think it’s a good time to think about that.
I think so. The best place to think about that, of course, is out there when 
you head back to your own rooms and have a good night’s rest. Be ready to 
get up nice and early tomorrow morning, remembering that the clocks 
change at midnight.
Spring forward.
So we’re starting at 9:00 a.m. on the dot. Be there at 8:30, which will be 
7:30 today’s time, I believe, if that’s right.
That would be correct.
So be there waiting at 7:30 a.m. today’s time, which will be 8:30 a.m.
tomorrow’s time, and we’ll be ready to start the show.

Igor:
Now a couple of announcements, folks.
1. I’d like you to give yourselves a big round of applause for having 
completed this course.
Applause
2. Recognize the hard work you put in. 
This has been a boot camp, hasn’t it?
Yes.
You have worked hard, have you not?
Yes.
We promised we’d push you, and have we pushed you?
Yes.
Did we deliver on every one of our promises?
Yes.
I’m glad to hear that because in the back of the room you will find 12 piles 
of certificates. They’re in the same order of the groups that you’re in. I 
recommend that you have one person pick up all the certificates for your 
group. When we head outside, you can just divide them amongst each 
other. 
Hopefully, the ones that have your name on it will be the ones you’ll take, 
but it’s up to you. Just as recognition for the hard work you’ve done. The 
only reason I’m going to ask you to ease your way out is because we’ve got 
to reset this whole room for tomorrow, and that’s going to take us few hours 
to do. So whatever you need to be doing, please move along and take care 
of that sort of stuff outside. 
Other than that, really, all I have to say is that as far as I’m concerned, this 
is the end of the seminar. The learning, as far as what we’re teaching you, 
is stopping here because you’re ready. These guys are ready to do their 
show, aren’t they?

Tomorrow is your day. You guys are fantastic. I am so impressed with 
everything that you guys have done. 
Just remember this, as Don said before, hypnotists are not a sideline act. 
They’re not a warm-up act. You are the main act. You’re the reason people 
come there for. Tomorrow you will be the reason why people will be sitting 
in this room. So have fun. Enjoy it. Be the star of the show, and don’t put 
any pressure on yourself. Keep it simple. You’ve done it dozens of times in 
here, and if your mind goes blank, just do what you’ve done in here and 
you’ll do a great job.
Does that make sense?
Yes.
Now the only thing I have left to say is go home!
Applause
