To my family

Acknowledgments
I’d like to ﬁrst thank Alberto Cairo. In non-English speaking countries, there are 
a few oases when it comes to publishing original data visualization books, but the 
landscape is basically a barren desert. I wanted to help change that, so I wrote 
the ﬁrst manuscript of this book in my mother tongue, Portuguese. I then asked 
Alberto if he would read it. 
Not only can Alberto read Portuguese, but we also share a similar view of what 
we think data visualization is all about, in spite of working in diﬀerent areas. To 
make a long story short, he liked the book and introduced me to his acquisitions 
editor, Nikki McDonald, and so my data visualization journey took a turn. With 
the help of Nikki, my development editor Dan Foster, copy editor Jan Seymour, and 
production editor Kim Wimpse, my poor manuscript became a real book. Alberto 
read several chapters of the English version and provided invaluable feedback.
Stephen Few also read a few chapters and saved me from myself once or twice, 
for which I am very appreciative.
If I know how to make a few charts that you can’t ﬁnd in the Excel charts library, 
that’s because I learned it from, or was inspired by, Jon Peltier, the true Excel 
charts master. I’m deeply grateful to Jon for all the knowledge and generosity he 
shared with the community for well over 10 years.
Andreas Lipphardt’s untimely death was the saddest moment along my data visu-
alization journey. I wrote a few posts for his company’s blog, and we talked oen 
about working together in the future. I still wonder what would have happened 
if we had.
Finally, I thank my family. When I was more interested in writing this book than 
actually make a living, Teresa and the kids were very patient and supportive.

INTRODUCTION
No data point is an island, 
Entire of itself, 
Every data point is a piece of the continent, 
A part of the pattern.
e venerable poet John Donne must be turning in his grave with 
this paraphrase of his beautiful meditation “No man is an island,” 
but I couldn’t ﬁnd a beer way to express the nature of data, which 
have a context and a web of relationships. e path to knowledge 
lies in discovering and making these relationships visible.
Social change and technological progress have made the world a 
more uncertain place. As another poet, Luís de Camões (not related), 
said, “Change doesn’t change like it used to.” In an eﬀort to cope 
with uncertainty, we put technology at the service of mass data 
production and retrieval. is has been called by many names over 
the years. Today we call it “Big Data.”

Acquiring and storing data has become the goal; the more data, the beer. But 
are we missing the point? We no longer need more data if it’s not accompanied by 
the right skills that turn it into truly beer data. We need to consider how those 
who need the data will use it, and for what purpose. Otherwise, it’s pointless to 
continue accumulating useless data, collecting digital dust in a forgoen folder 
on a hard disk. Waiting. Or, worse yet, making pie charts.
A Quantitative Change
Suppose that the data you work with is now updated daily rather than monthly, 
multiplying its total volume by 30. As Arthur C. Clark told us, a quantitative 
change of this magnitude forces a qualitative change in organizational culture, 
our aitude toward data, and data’s role in decision making. Just imagine if the data 
allowed you to react to whatever is happening (rather than merely acknowledging 
what happened weeks ago) so that you become aware of its impact on all levels of 
the organization, beginning with how each person interprets their roles and tasks.
Only a planetary catastrophe would prevent the ever escalating volume of data. 
In the past, much of human experience was absent from our data monitoring 
systems, but it’s now beginning to be quantiﬁed. In a few years, we’ll reminisce 
aﬀectionately over the complaints about information overload that we have today.
is is where data visualization begins. But beware. Data visualization is mar-
keted today as the miracle cure that will open the doors to success, whatever its 
shape. We have enough experience to realize that in reality it’s not always easy 
to distinguish between real usefulness and zealous marketing. Aer the initial 
excitement over the prospects of data visualization comes disillusionment, and 
aer that the possibility of a balanced assessment. e key is to get to this point 
quickly, without disappointments and at a lower cost. is book is designed to 
help get you there.
A Language for Multiple Users
Data visualization helps us manage information. To make the most of this infor-
mation, we must ﬁrst accept the fact that “data visualization” does not exist as 
a single entity. Instead, think of it as a blanket term: It exists diﬀerently for each 
group of people who use it.
I INTRODUCTION
xv

Visualization is like a language. Paraphrasing the Portuguese writer José Saramago, 
“ere is no English; there are languages in English.” For example, although 
people from the United States, Wales, and South Africa all speak English, they’d 
likely have some diﬃculty communicating because their versions of English are 
all so diﬀerent, having changed from their common core over the years based on 
their geographical and social contexts. 
Data visualization is a graphical language, used diﬀerently depending on the 
“speaker.” A graphic designer, a statistician, or a manager starts from the same 
foundations of data visualization, but each has diﬀerent goals, skills, and contexts, 
which are reﬂected in their diﬀerent visualization choices.
A Wrong Model
Imagine that we all wish to write poetry. For the unfortunate not blessed with 
the gi of rhyming, the word processor oﬀers some models that help with writing 
reports in the form of folk poetry. Seems absurd? Well, this is what happens with 
data visualization, too, when we look to spreadsheet chart templates to help 
overcome our weaknesses.
Graphic designers have made visualization the fashion phenomenon it is today—
their poetry meant to be seen by large audiences and evidenced in data journalism, 
books, blogs, and social networks. Results vary between the brilliance of many 
visualizations in the New York Times, for instance, and the mediocrity of many 
infographics created by marketing departments as clickbait.
Meanwhile, millions of charts made with spreadsheets remain hidden within 
business organizations. e obscure, everyday users of oﬃce tools, unaware of 
beer visualization models adapted to their contexts, mistakenly see the design-
ers’ work as a reference to imitate, oen with catastrophic results. Peer pressure, 
the this-is-what-the-client-wants, vendor sales tactics, and a lack of training feed 
the illusion that there is beauty in bad poetry.
ere is not. e purpose of data visualization in organizations is not to make 
beautiful charts; it is to make eﬀective charts. And, as we shall see, if your 
charts are eﬀective, they’re also likely to be beautiful, even in aspects with strong 
associations to aesthetics, such as the use of color.

A Better Model
Visualizations craed by graphic designers are oen appealing, but in a busi-
ness context we can’t use the same model. At a time when graphic literacy in 
organizations is still low, we must evaluate this model’s usefulness, beginning 
with four simple concepts:
 
I
Process. Visual displays of information in business organizations and in 
the media have diﬀerent goals and diﬀerent production and consumption 
processes, which should not be mixed up.
 
I
Asymmetry. Information asymmetry—whereby one party has more or 
beer information than the other—is generally less evident within an 
organization than, say, between journalists and their readers. Graphical 
representations must adapt to this diﬀerence, adding detail in the former 
and ﬁnding the core message in the laer.
 
I
Model. If you hire a data visualization expert, make sure she is aligned 
with your organization’s speciﬁc interests or focus, because her data visu-
alization model may prove incompatible with the organizational culture, 
daily work processes, available tools, and skill sets. It’s almost impossible, 
for example, to convince an Excel user to learn a few lines of code, so this 
cannot be an expectation.
 
I
Technology. Almost everything you need to understand about data visual-
ization can be learned and practiced in a spreadsheet, which is an everyday 
tool people are familiar with.
Today, business organizations are encouraged to become more eﬃcient and eﬀective. 
Improving the return on investment (ROI) of their data should be a top priority. 
is is achieved by adhering to data visualization principles and best practices, 
and especially through a change of perspective, which has negligible costs, both 
in absolute ﬁnancial terms and when compared to the results of past practices.
In fact, many data visualization best practices are no diﬀerent from the rules 
of etiquee. A set of rules that is merely a ritualization of common sense is easy 
to understand, but must be internalized and practiced.
In short, data visualization in an organizational context has unique characteristics 
that must be identiﬁed and respected. e display of business data is not art, nor 
is it an image to aract aention in a newspaper, or a moment of leisure between 
I INTRODUCTION
xvii

more serious tasks. Business visualization is ﬁrst and foremost an eﬀective way to 
discover and communicate complex information, taking advantage of the noblest 
of our senses, sight, to support the organization’s mission and goals.
Data Visualization for the Masses
I write a blog about data visualization (excelcharts.com), and over the years I have 
oen been tempted to move away from the worksheet and devote myself to true 
visualization tools. is would be the normal path. But the spreadsheet is the only 
tool that the vast majority of us have access to in an organizational context, and 
geing data visualization to the average person must start from this contingency 
if we want to encourage learning and increase graphical literacy. en, at some 
later point, people and organizations will assess whether the tool adequately 
satisﬁes their needs and can then make a natural and demanding transition to 
other applications. Or not.
is is therefore a book about data visualization for the masses—that is, for those 
who, with the support of a spreadsheet, use visual representations of data as an 
analytical and communications tool: students in their academic work, sellers in 
their sales analysis, product managers in planning their budgets, and managers 
in their performance assessments.
The Labor Market
Taking into account the economic circumstances of today, is it justiﬁed to invest 
in statistics, data analysis, and data visualization skills? As I mentioned, with the 
exception of a scenario of global catastrophe, it’s diﬃcult to imagine a future that 
does not involve an increase in the volume of data and the need to use it. In fact, 
these skills are becoming central to the vast universe of what we call “knowledge 
workers.” Compared to other skills, these skills cut across more areas of activity, 
ensuring some competitive advantages in the labor market within the expected 
social, economic, and technological trends.
A study¹ by consultants McKinsey & Company on “Big Data” estimates that in 2018, 
in the United States alone, there will be a shortage of up to 190,000 people with 
high analytical skills, and a shortage of about 1.5 million managers and analysts 
with analytical skills to use data in the process of decision-making.

It’s wise to read these reports with some skepticism, of course, considering their 
unknown agendas. Nevertheless, this study indicates the need for qualiﬁed human 
resources in this area, of which data visualization is an essential part.
My View of Data Visualization
I have on my desk a report that includes hundreds of charts, all of which are 
ineﬃcient, ugly, and useless. ere isn’t a single chart I am proud of. And, yes, 
it was I who made them, many years ago, as one of my ﬁrst professional tasks. 
Even more embarrassing is that I remember the report’s commercial success.
I had not yet realized it, but working with data would become as normal for me as 
breathing. I didn’t pay much aention to it at the time, until one day I stumbled 
upon a book: e Visual Display of Quantitative Information, by a certain Edward 
Tue. For me, this was the Book of Revelation. In it, I discovered data visualiza-
tion as a concept and as a ﬁeld of study, and it was love at ﬁrst sight.
Over the years, I realized that there are no universal rules and goals in this ﬁeld. 
Subjectivity, personal aesthetic sensibilities, the task at hand, the proﬁle of skills 
and interests, the audience—these all conspire to minimize things that we take for 
granted, such as the importance of eﬀectiveness in the transmission of the message.
Within this relativism, the easy answer is to accept that anything goes. roughout 
this book, you’ll see examples of dead ends where this path sometimes takes us. 
But if we accept that there is no one-size-ﬁts-all perspective, and that there are 
no universal rules, we still must seek a coherent theory for each group of prac-
titioners and consumers.
My view of data visualization is an exercise in everyday normality: Simply give the 
eyes what they need to see, so that the visualization goals are met at minimal cost, 
in the same natural way we use vision to check whether we can cross a roadway.
To take advantage of vision, we must understand that there is no diﬀerence in 
nature between the physical landscape around us and the graphical landscape 
we create on a screen or on a sheet of paper.
Organization of the Book
is book follows a narrow path between theory that’s too abstract to be useful 
for everyday tasks and practice that’s too focused on a concrete task to help us 
understand the general rules. I tried to follow this path in every chapter, showing 
I INTRODUCTION
xix

how theory applies in each example and how the speciﬁc task always has a theo-
retical framework that explains, justiﬁes, and generalizes it. It’s important to 
understand why, not just how.
To begin to understand data visualization, the ﬁrst part of this book describes the 
context in which the action takes place: the characteristics of the human senses, 
the objects we use when making charts, the role of perception, how knowledge 
is acquired, and the many ways of deﬁning data visualization.
In the second part of the book, we’ll recognize that a chart is a visual argument, 
an answer to a question, and that the quality of this answer begins with the chart 
type you choose. en, we’ll format the chart. You’ll see that the best chart for-
maing serves the content and is not distinguished from it, praising its qualities 
and reducing its ﬂaws.
roughout the book, we’ll analyze data visualization in an organizational con-
text, including good practices in data management, the Excel chart library, how 
to avoid bad soware defaults, and how to use application ﬂexibility to go beyond 
what the Excel library seems to oﬀer.
The Limits of This Book
I wrote this book with a particular reader proﬁle in mind: those who are not paid 
professionally for their aesthetic talents and artistic skills.
You might ﬁnd this problematic, because designing a chart seems to require 
these skills. But I totally reject that. You need not be artistically talented to create 
eﬀective charts.
I believe in increasing graphical literacy, and for that to happen we can help build a 
safety net of basic criteria for producing eﬀective visual representations. I believe 
this will be useful at the professional level and will also contribute (marginally) 
to a more critical citizenship.
is book focuses on identifying the basic principles of data visualization for 
an organizational environment, as performed by individuals who have certain 
skills and who use a very speciﬁc tool: the spreadsheet. e intersection of these 
factors deﬁnes the main limits of this book:
 
I
Major visualization types. In the ﬁrst chapter, you’ll see data visualiza-
tion classiﬁed into three major groups: charts (we deﬁne “charts” in the 
ﬁrst chapter), networks, and maps. Although they have some common 
principles, networks and maps are excluded from this book because they 
have a speciﬁc vocabulary that must be addressed in the proper context.

I
e chart. A chart is just one part of the information communication 
within an organization, just like a single paragraph of a story. Since this 
is an introductory book, there will be a balance between this concept of 
the “graphical landscape” and the idea of a chart as the minimum unit 
of data visualization.
 
I
Excel. e spreadsheet soware I use now is Excel 2016, with which I made 
all the charts for this book. When it was necessary to refer to application 
features and capabilities, I tried to be as generic as possible in order to 
include other versions of Excel and even other spreadsheet programs.
I
Chart types. Due to its ﬂexibility, Excel allows us to go beyond its library. 
roughout this book, you’ll ﬁnd many examples of this ﬂexibility. But 
there are hard limits (charts that Excel just can’t do) and so limits (charts 
that would be so diﬃcult to create and with such a low cost–beneﬁt ratio 
that in practice we should not aempt to use them regularly). For Excel, 
networks and maps represent such exceptions.
 
I
Not a manual. Although wrien with Excel users in mind, this book is not 
a manual of techniques, tips, and tricks.
I
No retouching. It’s important for me to ensure that the charts you’ll ﬁnd 
in this book are true to the original made in Excel, so they have not been 
retouched by additional soware, even in the management of text elements, 
in which Excel is especially limited. However, for inclusion in the book 
with the highest possible quality, the charts were exported to PDF, which 
led to some minor changes that I have tried to minimize.
ere’s also a practical limitation regarding the data. I wanted to use real data, 
not some fake business indicators, but this poses problems of conﬁdentiality and 
limited interest. To circumvent that, I used oﬃcial statistics as a proxy for business 
data. Except for a few specialized contexts, we can use the same methodology and 
chart types. Both are in deep need of a more eﬀective approach.
Break the Rules!
Data visualization is not a science; it is a crossroads at which certain scientiﬁc 
knowledge is used to justify and frame subjective choices. is doesn’t mean that 
rules don’t count. Rules exist and are eﬀective when applied within the context 
for which they were designed.
You’ll ﬁnd many rules in this book—so many rules that the temptation to break 
them (intelligently) may be overwhelming. If this is your case, congratulations, 
I INTRODUCTION
xxi

that’s the spirit. I myself could not resist and tried to test the limits and possible 
alternatives. I invite you to do the same.
Companion Website
As I said, this book is not a manual. It will not teach you how to make a chart in 
Excel. You won’t ﬁnd even a single formula.
at’s why we set up a comprehensive companion website for the book:
 
I
dataatworkbook.com
On the website, you’ll ﬁnd:
 
I
All the relevant original charts in Excel ﬁles that you can download and 
play with. I’ve also included brief comments for each chart to help you 
learn how to make them. When you see the 
  icon, it means that the chart 
is available to download.
 
I
Links to the original data sources and, when possible, a dynamic bookmark 
to the most recent data.
 
I
Links to other content referenced in the book. You’ll ﬁnd icons sprinkled 
throughout the book that invite you to read a relevant paper, watch a video, 
go to a web page, and so on. When you see this icon 
 , it means that you’ll 
ﬁnd a link on the companion website.
I welcome your comments, suggestions, and change requests. I ask you to add 
them liberally on the website for the beneﬁt of all.
I’ll try to be aware of comments and suggestions made on social media and con-
sumer reviews on major online book retailers and address them on the book’s 
website, if needed.
Over time, I’ll add original charts not published in the book as well as additional 
resources, so be sure to check in oen.
You can ﬁnd me on most social media, but I confess that Twier is the only service 
I use regularly. I will tweet about new content, so if you follow me (@camoesjo) 
you won’t miss it!

THE BUILDING BLOCKS  
OF DATA VISUALIZATION
Imagine you’re in your living room reading a book. You look and see 
the TV, a ﬁreplace, a few family pictures. A souvenir from a long-
ago vacation draws your aention and makes you feel momentarily  
nostalgic. You shake oﬀ these feelings and return to your book.
In those ﬂeeting moments, light reﬂected from the objects in the 
room entered your eyes and was converted into visual stimuli and 
sent to the brain. Your brain homed in on select stimuli to recognize 
and identify key objects (even that book over there partially covered 
by a newspaper) while ignoring others, and conjured up complicated 
feelings of wistful aﬀection. 
Now imagine that the book partially covered by the newspaper in 
our lile scenario is a history of painting, inside of which you’ll ﬁnd 
a reproduction of René Magrie’s e Treachery of Images/is is not 
a pipe. 

2
Magrie’s painting reminds us that the world and its representations are not 
the same. But there is something that the world and its representations share: 
the eye–brain system—the physiological system that converts light into visual 
stimuli and generates meaningful images (Figure 1.1).
Like the pipe in Magrie’s painting, data visualization is a representation of 
the world. It isn’t a representation of objects such as ﬁreplaces, books, or pipes, 
but rather of abstract shapes—building blocks whose aributes of color, size, 
or position in space vary according to our design choices and according to the 
quantitative data upon which they’re based. We manipulate these shapes to cre-
ate charts, infographics, or “graphical landscapes” in general.
How do we translate a data table into visual objects? In the ﬁrst chapters of this 
book, we’ll analyze this connection and why it maers. We’ll begin by transforming 
the building blocks into multiple chart types. Some charts will be more appealing 
and eﬀective than others, though all will be useful to our study.

Data Sensing
Figure 1.2 represents the distribution of university students in Portugal¹ by areas of 
knowledge. Now, here’s a question for you: Does this table have a ﬂavor? Is it bitter, 
sweet, or sour?
Let me rephrase that to make it sound a little less bizarre: Would it be possible to use 
food to recreate this chart so that we could literally taste the diﬀerence in values? My 
limited cooking skills tell me that, yes, we could associate low values to a bitter taste 
and high values to sweet ﬂavors and place them strategically on, say, a pizza. But 
although we could use other senses (such as hearing, smell, or touch) to make, well, 
sense of quantitative data, would we want to?
Not really. Vision is our most developed sense, and it accounts 
for a large proportion of all stimuli processed by the brain. 
In other words, the brain devotes more of its resources to 
processing visual data than any other sensory input, which 
explains why it’s easier and more precise to use sight to 
read a chart than to use smell, taste, or touch.
Humans are visual animals. We are so aware of the power of 
the eye–brain system that when we imagine superior alien 
life forms, we usually envision creatures with big eyes and 
oversized brains, vanishing noses, invisible ears, and, most 
likely, a limited sense of taste and touch (Figure 1.3). These 
beings from planets in galaxies far, far away are closer to 
us than those blind creatures inhabiting the depths of the 
Earth’s oceans.
1 I’m using real data for this book, and my criterion for choosing a series is how interesting the 
variation is, not the reality it refers to. I would like to have chosen an obscure and rich Caribbean 
country with a sophisticated statistical system as my primary data source, so as to reap the beneﬁts 
of real data with a fresh perspective not bound by a familiar reality. However, because I couldn’t ﬁnd 
such a source, I’ve struck a balance between data from the U.S. and the European Union.

Spatial Organization of Stimuli
Visual stimuli come from a ﬁnite space: the limits of our ﬁeld of vision. Let’s sup-
pose Figure 1.4 represents these limits. is detailed image allows us to choose 
several levels of analysis: We can start from a global view of a mountain landscape 
with a river, and then zoom in to a more detailed level where we notice a fallen 
tree trunk, several peaks, or perhaps recognize a species of tree.
Superimposing a coordinate system lets us reference points in the landscape: 
ere’s a fallen tree trunk in coordinates x1y1, a peak in x2y2, and so on. Each 
point, deﬁned by a pair of coordinates, belongs at the same time to a single object 
(such as a tree trunk) and to an object within another object (for example, a tree 
within a tree line within a landscape). ere are shapes and paerns with dif-
ferent levels of complexity.

But what if we use the coordinate system to draw the landscape?
is new picture (Figure 1.5) looks a lot like a simpliﬁed version of the previous 
one. We recognize the mountains and the river, but, as Magrie said, this is not 
a pipe. In fact, it’s neither a landscape nor a pipe; it’s a stacked area chart made 
in Excel. For all we know, it might represent the evolution of sales in some un-
known market. 
Just as we interpret a blue line in a photo as a river, we also seek recognizable 
paerns in a chart that allow us to read, understand, and act. Recognition of 
shapes and the aribution of meaning are similar in both images, in both land-
scapes. From this point of view, data visualization does nothing more than create 
graphical landscapes based on data tables.
If something distinguishes the two images, that something is our inability to 
create a graphical landscape as rich in stimuli and diversity in level of detail as 
the ﬁrst image. Adding and managing meaningful details is one of the biggest 
challenges in data visualization.

Seeing Abstract Concepts
If a graphical landscape does not contain representations of real objects with 
physical shapes and instead represents abstract concepts only (such as the rate 
of inﬂation or population density), how can we make these concepts visible? e 
answer seems obvious now, but it was not so for many centuries: associating 
abstract concepts with geometric shapes whose characteristics vary according 
to the underlying data.
You may recall from school that there are four basic geometric primitives, distin-
guished by their number of dimensions: the point (dimensionless), the line (one 
dimension), the area or plane (two dimensions), and volume (three dimensions).
When we use the number of dimensions as the classiﬁcation criterion of visual 
displays, we get four distinct groups: charts, networks, and maps, along with 
ﬁgurative visualizations as a special group. e table in Figure 1.6 summarizes 
their essential characteristics.²
2 In other words, the minimum number of dimensions you need to represent an object. Although 
you can use an area (a slice of a pie chart) or a line (a bar in a bar chart), those are design choices, 
because all you need is a point. Likewise, the line is the minimum you need to represent a network, 
and points and areas can be used as design choices.

Charts
e primary geometric primitive used in charts is the point, represented in a 
2D space through pairs of coordinates, horizontal (x) and vertical (y), with the 
origin in the lower-le corner (Figure 1.7). Values increase upward and to the 
right and decrease downward and to the le. When one of the coordinates is 
missing (or has a ﬁxed value), the points are distributed along the opposite axis. 
You may need to adjust this description to ﬁt the type of metric you’re using: In a 
time series (Figure 1.8), the sequence goes from less recent (on the le) to more 
recent (on the right).
Note that the word chart can have several meanings and can include tables, maps, 
graphs, or network diagrams. Graph has a stricter deﬁnition of a visual represen-
tation of one or more variables, although it can be confused with a very speciﬁc 
ﬁeld in mathematics called graph theory. “Graph” is the right word to use, I have 
no doubt. Unfortunately, 30 years ago Microso decided to use “charts” in Excel, 
and now it feels a lile awkward to say “Excel graph” instead of “Excel chart.” 
Since this book is aimed at Excel users, we’ll use “chart” and deﬁne it as a visual 
object that you can ﬁnd or derive from the Excel chart library.

In more abstract terms, a chart is the product of a process that transcribes a data 
table into pairs of coordinates and then applies design transformations that allow 
us to visualize them. We’ll see what this means in a minute.
Aer transforming table values into data points and ploing them all on the plane, 
we’ll get a cloud of data points where we get an accurate representation of their 
relative distances. is is the stepping stone for everything we’ll do aerwards, 
because a lot of things start to happen when we see and compare distances be-
tween data points or between each of them and the axes. What will we do with 
this cloud? Essentially, we’ll make it visible by, for example, using lines to connect 
data points and creating a line chart. ese complementary primitives play a key 
role in the way we’ll read the chart and how eﬀective it will become.

Networks
e line is the main geometric primitive for displaying networks (Figure 1.9) 
because it represents connections between data points. We still need to plot 
the data points in the 2D plane, but their coordinates are ﬂexible and you can 
change them to beer represent these relationships. Even though both points 
and lines are relevant when visualizing networks, observing relationships and 
detecting meaningful behavior (centrality, paerns, outliers) is our primary goal 
in network analysis.

Excel add-in for visualizing networks.
A classic example of network representation is the diagram of the London Tube, 
where geographic references to the world above are vague, and we measure 
distances by the number of tube stations rather than by miles. 
Maps
Maps may use points and lines, but their use of area sets them apart from charts 
and networks. Maps are the most ﬁgurative form of visual display and the form 
we’ve been using the longest (Figure 1.10).

Volume: Figurative Visualizations
Most visualizations take place in a 2D plane (a sheet of paper or a screen). ere 
may come a time when immersive technologies allow us to navigate 3D data 
landscapes, but we’re not there yet. And it isn’t a technological issue only. It’s also 
a perceptual one. In a 3D space, objects can be hidden behind other objects (occlu-
sion). And our perception is not good at comparing sizes when distance from us 
is factored in: Is a particular car bigger than another, or is it simply nearer to us?
We can fake 3D, however. Scientiﬁc visualizations do it all the time to model physi-
cal objects, for example. Unfortunately, results are less than stellar when applied 
to abstract concepts. What we get are many pseudo-3D visualizations, where the 
third dimension is meaningless, irrelevant, and decorative. We’ll discuss that 
later in the book.

DATA AT WORK
12
So, we’ll reserve volume not for 3D visualization but for representations of real-
world objects or objects without a direct connection to a data table. You see these 
representations oen in newspapers or magazines to show how an accident 
happened, for example. ey work well, either alone or combined with other 
forms of visualization. We typically refer to them as illustrations, but this is too 
generic a term. I prefer to call them ﬁgurative visualizations because they depict 
a physical object or reality.
Visualization in Excel
Charts, networks, maps, and ﬁgurative visualizations share a common set of 
visual characteristics, but they’re also diﬀerent enough to make combining them 
all in a single tool almost impossible. Not surprisingly, charts are the major type 
of visualization oﬀered by spreadsheets like Excel.
You can visualize basic networks and maps in Excel, but that requires a lot of work, 
buying add-ins, or both. And it never feels “natural” to the soware, although this 
is starting to change with Excel 2016. at’s why we’ll focus almost exclusively 
on charts in this book, although you should always think of charts (as deﬁned 
above) as a subset of all possible forms of data visualization.
Retinal Variables
We superimposed a grid over the photo of the mountain, and now the location 
of each point in the image can be deﬁned by its distance to the horizontal and 
vertical axes. But what about depth? Can we change the position of the data point 
in the third dimension or, in the context of data visualization, the z axis? No, we 
can’t, because we only have two dimensions in the image. But, what if we pretend 
that a third dimension exists and we can use it to our advantage? I’m not talking 
about holographic images or, even worse, pseudo-3D eﬀects.
Imagine yourself ﬂying over a mountain range (Figure 1.11). Using only indirect 
clues—the shades of blue in the sea, the brown earth, the green forests, and the 
white snow—you can estimate the relative altitude of the peaks below you. Maps 
have long copied this ﬁgurative scale to give us a sense of altitude on paper; the 
good news is that nothing prevents us from generalizing this pair (color, altitude) 
and going beyond a cartographic representation.

is is the domain of what one of the founding fathers of data visualization, the 
French cartographer Jacques Bertin, called retinal variables: visual and positional 
characteristics of points, lines, and areas that we can use to manipulate graphical 
representations. Coordinates x,y deﬁne position, and instead of a z axis we have 
a z dimension where we display other visual features.
e table in Figure 1.12 illustrates some of these variables. e ﬁrst example, 
Position, uses only two variables: the position variables x and y. e example 
below that, Luminance, in reality contains at least four variables—position 
(x and y), luminance, and size—and it’s possible to add more (multiple shapes, 
diﬀerent directions). In practice, however, it’s advisable to add no more than four 
variables to keep the charts readable.

DATA AT WORK
14
Note that retinal variables are not interchangeable. eir characteristics make 
them eﬀective in representing certain data types and useless in representing 
others. Before seeing an example, remember a traditional classiﬁcation of variables:
 
I
Quantitative. ese variables can, in theory, take any value in a range.
 
I
Qualitative. ese variables represent a limited number of categorical 
values that we can count. If these values have an implicit scale or order, 
we refer to them as ordinal variables (weekdays, for example); if there is 
no implicit ordering, we refer to them as nominal variables (gender, race, 
fruit names, cities).
As you can see in the table, variables such as position or size rank higher at rep-
resenting quantitative data, albeit with diﬀerent levels of accuracy. Texture and 
shape are beer suited for representing nominal data, since they don’t vary in 
range or allow for the perception of ordered data. (For example, in Figure 1.12, 
if textures encoded quantitative data, would you be able to tell which represent 
the highest value?) Color (hue) is used to encode nominal variables, but we oen 
ask of it something it cannot give us accurately: an ordered representation of 
categories. Can you be sure these hues are ordered  
 ? 
Wouldn’t it be beer to use something like this  
 ?

Several authors have, over time, suggested the addition of new variables to the 
original list. Jock D. Mackinlay is one of the authors who tried to make Bertin’s 
list more comprehensive, while ranking each variable for its eﬀectiveness at 
representing quantitative, ordinal, and nominal data types. In Figure 1.13, we see 
Mackinlay’s list of variables, ordered by degree of eﬀectiveness. Variable Position 
maintains its top place in the three lists, while Shape is useless to express quan-
titative or ordinal data and poorly represents nominal data. ere’s an exchange 
of positions in which the variables that best represent quantitative data are the 
worst at representing ordinal data, while, with a few exceptions, rankings are 
more stable between ordinal and nominal variables.

A third characteristic of retinal variables is their power to draw aention. is is 
a useful feature for managing data relevancy and is one of the largest contributors 
for communicating our interpretation, as opposed to the use of the default set-
tings of the soware. e manipulation of the characteristics of retinal variables 
to both emphasize and deemphasize has a technical dimension, but it needs to 
be framed in the context of a visual rhetoric.⁴ We speak of visual rhetoric when, 
for example, we use the expression “lie with charts.” Subjectivity in charts is 
inevitable, but throughout this book we’ll seek ways to identify the fuzzy area 
where acceptable subjectivity ends and misleading visualization begins.

Information.” ACM Transactions on Graphics, Vol. 5, No. 2: 110–141, April 1986.
4 ere is a long tradition of rhetoric as the art of persuasion through the spoken word. A visual 
rhetoric shares the same goals and uses many of the same strategies, but a signiﬁcant amount of the 
message uses images instead of words. Simply put, we can lie to persuade (traditional rhetoric), and 
we can lie with charts to persuade (visual rhetoric).

From Concepts to Charts
As we’ve seen, to make a chart we need a data table, a two-dimensional plan with a 
coordinate system, one or more selected geometric primitives, and retinal variables.
Let’s return to our table of student distribution and test these ingredients with 
two versions of the same chart (Figure 1.14). For simplicity’s sake, we’ll represent 
the year 2010 only, ploing the data points along the vertical axis. e coordinates 
for each data point take the form (2010,y). For example, the pair of coordinates 
for the Social Sciences is (2010; 31.8%). e highest value in the table also corre-
sponds to the value furthest from the origin in the chart, and the relative distances 
between the points reﬂect the diﬀerences in the table: In this case, the distance 
of the point representing the Social Sciences (31.8%) is approximately two times 
the distance of the point representing Health (16.3%).

Although we’re using a small table, the chart allows us to immediately grasp its 
content: ree areas stand out (Social Sciences, Engineering, and Health), fol-
lowed by a tight group of four more areas, and one last point, Agriculture, with 
an almost residual value.
On the le chart, we keep dimensions x and z ﬁxed, while dimension y varies. 
On the right, we added a new variable to the chart. is nominal variable groups 
knowledge areas (Social Sciences and Humanities, for example) using color or 
shades of gray. In other words, we color-coded the dots to add new information, 
varying the z dimension (in Bertin’s deﬁnition).
e new information invites reading beyond simple comparisons. Depending on 
the goals, this can be seen either as an advantage (it adds complexity to the initial 
message) or as noise (more detail distracts from the essential). e red dot draws 
more aention than the other dots, inﬂuencing the way we read the chart and 
agreeing with the idea of a visual rhetoric.
The Proto-Chart
e point is the most important geometric primitive in a chart, and oen the 
only one we need to be able to read the distances between them aer visually 
transcribing the values in the data table. But we can add more objects to help us 
read and understand the chart: It would be diﬃcult, for example, to analyze time 
series without the connecting lines in each series.
To understand how we get to each chart type, let’s call the set of points ploed 
on the 2D plane a proto-chart. Imagine this proto-chart with no visible existence, 
nothing but data points coded within the computer’s memory. e proto-chart 
becomes a visible chart when we apply geometric primitives, retinal variables, 
and supporting objects, like titles, axis labels, or grid lines.
Let’s try an exercise where we apply a set of transformations to the same data 
to create various chart types, each of which will help us understand where the 
chart types come from  (Figure 1.15).

DATA AT WORK
18
Figure 1.15 Multiple chart types for the same data.
 
I
Strip plot (A). On the le, we have a strip plot (one variable, varying along 
an axis). is format most closely matches the proto-chart, with only a few 
identifying features added.
 
I
Line chart (B). In the line chart, each data point gets its own pair of coor-
dinates, based on value (vertical axis) and, in this dataset, time (horizontal 
axis). e line connects points in each time series, helping interpret the trend.
 
I
Bar chart (C). is is nothing more than a chart in which the points are 
distributed along the vertical axis so that we can label them. A thick line 
(the bar) connects the point to the axis. We stop comparing distances and 
start comparing bar lengths. We’ll discuss later why this is relevant.
 
I
Stacked bar chart (D). To the vertical coordinate of a point, we add all coor-
dinates of the previous points. Each bar connecting two points is usually 
color-coded so that we can identify it in the legend.
 
I
Donut charts and pie charts (E). ese are the result of transforming a 
stacked bar into a ring or a circle shape, although there are diﬀerences in 
the way we encode both charts.
is exercise conﬁrms that we create a chart by applying a set of transformations 
to the original mapping of data points in the proto-chart. A chart type expresses 
a standardized set of transformations.
Chart Eﬀectiveness
Even a small table can answer many questions, and there are a variety of chart 
types we can choose from to answer these questions. is means that we must 
deﬁne some sort of criteria to evaluate each chart’s eﬀectiveness.

One of the simplest ways is to check how well the chart meets certain require-
ments—such as, does it oﬀer good insights or can we interpret it at a glance? 
Let’s test this.
Figure 1.16. I call this the Graphenstein—a chart made of poor design choices I’ve collected 
from multiple real charts.
Figure 1.16 shows a common (and ugly) form of graphical representation. It’s supposed 
to allow us to compare proportions between two years. Based on your reading, 
answer the following questions that anyone interested in the topic might ask:
 
I
Which area of study grew the most?
 
I
Which area of study decreased the most?
 
I
How did Humanities behave?
 
I
How many areas of study are increasing and how many are decreasing?
Diﬃcult? Need more time? Believe it or not, these two pie charts contain the 
answers to all these questions.
But here’s the contradictory thing about pie charts. A common argument in favor 
of pie charts is that reading the labels compensates for what really are our dif-
ﬁculties in reading them accurately. As these charts show, this is not an argument 
in favor of pie charts; rather, it’s an argument to the detriment of visualization. 
Shouldn’t we be able to read the chart without deciphering all the labels? If we 
have to read both the labels and the chart, the chart becomes pointless, as labels 
should complement rather than entirely support it.
Obviously, this is an extreme example of a bad visual representation. Now multiply 
all the seconds spent trying to answer the questions by all readers of this book 
and the seconds turn into minutes, and the minutes into hours. If you’re required 
to consume reports and presentations with charts as hideous and ineﬀective as 

DATA AT WORK
20
these pie charts, you can only imagine the ﬁnancial impact of all that wasted 
time and eﬀort.
is is not, of course, the only possible representation of the data. We have to 
compare diﬀerent displays to understand how chart type and chart design inﬂu-
ence chart-reading eﬀectiveness. Now try to answer the same questions using a 
new chart (Figure 1.17). I’m sure you’ll be fascinated, just as one of my 10-year-old 
twins was, by how quickly and easily a problem went from nearly impossible to 
dead simple through a graphical representation.
is chart doesn’t have glossy colors or special eﬀects, and each option has a 
rational justiﬁcation. As a result, the chart eﬀectively answers all questions. 
Hard-to-spot variations in the pie charts are obvious here: Line slopes display 
changes clearly; and since we don’t need to use color to identify each category, 
we can use it instead either to create groups that add another level of analysis or 
to make the chart easier to read.

Poor chart choice and peculiar aesthetic options make the representation in 
Figure 1.16 useless, but the damage is even more extensive. Data acquisition, its 
preparation, chart design, and the time spent by the entire audience are costs 
that, although invisible for accounting purposes, are real and have no return. e 
absurdity is greater if we consider that the chart author would have taken longer 
“spicing it up” than making a good chart from the beginning.
is exercise shows how, with the same data table, you can create very diﬀerent 
graphical representations resulting in extraordinarily diﬀerent eﬀectiveness. 
It’s up to us to identify the goals and the answers that the task requires from us 
and look for the most appropriate visualization.
When you apply transformations to a proto-chart, you’re exercising design op-
tions. e criteria for those transformations should be clear and aligned with the 
task and audience proﬁle. As a rule of thumb, the more design dimensions and the 
more transformations you apply, the less eﬀective the chart becomes.
Like many data visualization rules, you can always ﬁnd a good exception: While 
an exploded, pseudo-3D pie chart and a treemap (Figure 1.18) are both heavily 
transformed, the transformations applied to make the pie chart are mostly 
gratuitous, whereas they have a clear purpose in a treemap.⁵ If transformations 
respect the way human perception works and translate into a greater awareness 
and interest for the chart, the impact will be positive. Negative transformations 
and design options are generally due to the lack of awareness of those perceptual 
mechanisms—or to an excessive need to create what the organizational jargon 
calls “high-impact charts.”
5 Like a pie chart, a treemap is used for a part-of-a-whole analysis, but because you have beer control 
over the rectangle sizes than over slices, you can have many more data points. Unlike with traditional 
pie charts, you can arrange the data hierarchically. You can compare a rectangle to all data points or 
to its own branch. In most implementations, you can associate ﬁll color with a continuous variable so 
that you can see, for example, a product’s market share (rectangle size) and growth (rectangle ﬁll color). 
Figure 1.18 Multiple transformations can have a negative impact (pie chart) or a positive 
impact (treemap).

Anatomy of a Bad Chart
As you read this book, you’ll gain a complete feel for what makes an eﬀective chart. 
But for now, here’s a partial list of signiﬁcant errors speciﬁc to the sample pie charts 
you’ve just seen:
 
I
Title. Summarizing the main ﬁndings in the chart title is a good idea, but here there 
is no relationship between the title and the content of the charts.
 
I
Font. Not all fonts are suitable to a formal setting. If we try to escape the standard 
Arial or Times New Roman, a font like Comic Sans might seem like a solution. It’s 
somewhat fun, unconventional, and appealing. But (as you can suspect from its name) 
it’s more suitable for comics, children’s books, and mom-and-pop stores. In other 
words, be aware that font choice can set the tone.
 
I
Chart type. We’ll see later why the pie chart is the wrong chart, but notice that if 
comparing slices in a pie is hard, it’s even harder to compare them in multiple pies.
 
I
Time direction. Convention tells us that time—as in the dates listed at the top of the 
two charts—ﬂows from left to right, like our written text. Perhaps it’s just a cultural 
thing, but if you want to break from this, ﬁrst decide if there are clear advantages 
to compensate for the cognitive adjustment that you’ll require from the reader.
 
I
3D eﬀect. The pseudo-3D eﬀect is one of the deadly sins of data visualization.
 
I
Exploded slices. When we want to emphasize an object, we make it diﬀerent from 
those around it. This is the (doubtful) purpose of exploding pie slices, but it’s 
destroyed when you do it for all slices, making the chart even more diﬃcult to read.
 
I
Color diﬀerentiation. With a single color, its range from lighter to darker must be 
great enough to allow for easy identiﬁcation. In this case, diﬀerentiation is not great 
enough; not only are there too many tones, but they’re harder to tell apart when 
seen in small samples, as in the legend.
 
I
Legends. Replace legends with another form of identiﬁcation whenever possible; 
contrary to popular belief, in pie charts they’re never needed.
 
I
Frames. Avoid frames. They create perceptual barriers and ﬁll the chart with unnec-
essary clutter.
 
I
Clip art. Annotating the chart, drawing attention, or explaining interesting details 
is a good practice. Inserting clip art does not ﬁt into this practice and in this case 
emphasizes the infantile traits suggested by the font.
 
I
Number of slices. In the chapter on pie charts, we’ll discuss how many slices are 
acceptable in a pie. In this case, the number is excessive, making the comparison 
between them diﬃcult.
 
I
Inconsistency. Color sequence is reversed between the two charts. We must strive 
for consistency when representing the same entities over multiple charts.
 
I
Background. The saturated yellow background is the main reason for the over-
stimulating eﬀect, diverting attention from the data.

1 I THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF DATA VISUALIZATION
23
If you ask me for a phrase that describes the aesthetics of a good chart, I would 
likely choose understated elegance. e pie charts in Figure 1.16 are neither under-
stated nor elegant. ey are loutish and scream for aention, while saying lile. 
e chart in Figure 1.17 is quieter and limits itself to conveying the message in a 
simple way, without distracting us with noise. Its aesthetics intend to be functional 
above all else, but the chart becomes an example of, as the visualization theorist 
Stephen Few put it, elegance through simplicity. at’s the way for visualization 
to have a real and important role in knowledge-building processes and decision-
making and not be limited to a decorative role with no beneﬁt.
roughout this book, not only will these perspectives become clearer, but also 
in the end you’ll have the tools needed to apply the right way of understanding 
business visualization. For someone with the technical skills to make Excel charts, 
only a change of perspective (based on sound data visualization principles) is 
needed to be able to go from ineﬀective to eﬀective.
Takeaways
 
I
By associating values in a table to geometric primitives and variables of 
the image with their aributes, data visualization takes advantage of the 
eye–brain system to process abstract data.
 
I
It all starts with the proto-chart, a transcription of the table values into 
pairs of coordinates.
 
I
ese pairs of coordinates map the data to a 2D plane, allowing us to start 
thinking in terms of distances instead of values.
 
I
Depth, the third dimension in the physical world, is not used in data 
visualization. 
 
I
Aer mapping the table values, all transformations we apply to make the 
actual chart (retinal variables and aributes) depend on our design choices.
 
I
What we call “chart types” are predeﬁned sets of transformations, like 
connecting the data points to make a line chart.
 
I
Chart eﬀectiveness is not absolute. Among other factors, it depends on the 
task and on the audience proﬁle.
 
I
Our choices (like chart type or formaing options) can greatly inﬂuence 
chart eﬀectiveness. Comparing multiple alternatives can help us to under-
stand which ones work beer for the speciﬁc task.

VISUAL PERCEPTION
A nice meal requires a lile more than blending some random  
ingredients in a food processor. e same holds true in data visu-
alization: e ability to manipulate geometric primitives and the 
retinal variables (as discussed in the previous chapter) is not enough 
to guarantee a “tasty” visual representation.
rowing all the data into a chart and leaving soware defaults 
unchanged is an unfortunate common practice—the visualization 
equivalent of cooking random ingredients with a food processor 
(you’ll ﬁnd an example later on in Figure 2.14).
ere is more to data visualization than that, and if you want to 
follow the optimal path, then you’re lucky, because the one you’ll 
naturally follow is the path of least resistance. You may know this 
as the principle of least eﬀort.

We can marvel at the brain’s sheer processing power, but the way it manages 
(and oen disguises) its ﬁnite resources is even more fascinating. Managing 
means allocating resources, deﬁning priorities and goals, simplifying processes, 
selecting the right information to support decision-making, and geing results. 
e brain performs these functions to interpret ambiguities and environmental 
complexities.
Data visualization uses the image processing connection between the eyes and 
the brain (the eye–brain system, introduced in Chapter 1). We must understand 
the basics of how this system works in order to optimize our visual representa-
tions and conserve precious brain resources. We need more brain resources to 
recognize a tree that doesn’t look like a tree or to compare two bars in a chart 
when the chart design makes them hard to compare. is is why it’s important 
to design with the principle of least eﬀort in mind. Many of the bad examples 
of data visualization are the result of disrespecting this principle. e pie charts 
from Chapter 1 oﬀer a glaring example.
Everything in the complex eye–brain system inﬂuences the way we read visual 
representations. In this chapter, we’ll discuss those things that seem more me-
chanical or objective: eye physiology, working memory, pre-aentive variables, 
and the Gestalt laws. en, in the next chapter, we’ll deal with the other side of 
the coin, the social dimension of the brain: prior experiences, social context, and 
culture. To start the discussion, let’s ﬁrst clarify the diﬀerences between percep-
tion and cognition and how they inﬂuence each other.
Perception and Cognition
Humans have a tremendous advantage over all other species: the ability to build 
and use tools to amplify our physical resources, protect ourselves, and make 
ourselves stronger. Human history is, largely, the history of discovering and 
using those tools.
In using these tools, however, the dilemma appears when we realize that our 
cognitive resources are ﬁnite and some intermediate tasks may use resources 
that we would instead prefer to allocate to higher-level tasks. If deciding whether 
you can buy a few copies of a data visualization book at a bookstore depends on 
calculating the total cost of the book and comparing that expense with your budget, 
then using a calculator (a tool) speeds up this task and gets you to the decision 
stage faster. It also allows you to allocate resources to more complex tasks, such 
as reading and evaluating the table of contents.

DATA AT WORK
26
Cognitive Oﬄoading
Calculator, ﬁngers, pencil and paper, spreadsheets: When we use any of these 
tools, we oﬄoad some of the cognitive tasks with the assumption that this will 
beneﬁt our overall cognitive processing.
Memory also aids cognitive oﬄoading. As an example, quickly answer this ques-
tion: Which multiplication product is higher, 7 × 8 or 6 × 9? Most adults memo-
rized multiplication tables long ago and should have no problem answering this 
in a few seconds. Children, however, will take longer to answer because they 
haven’t yet consolidated that memory and they must perform the calculations 
on the spot, perhaps using a tool. e memorization of elementary operations 
helps cognitive processing, which is one of the reasons we keep asking children 
to memorize multiplication tables.
Tools and memory are useful for removing those mental chores that small tasks 
impose on us, but have we done everything we can to avoid them in the ﬁrst 
place? We know that a well-deﬁned problem helps in solving it, and that applies 
to the way we represent data. When we replace leers and numbers with an 
equivalent visual translation, we transfer segments of our cognitive processes 
to our visual perception, minimizing cognitive costs. ese cognitive diﬀerences 
between adults and children are much less signiﬁcant if those values are pre-
sented visually (Figure 2.1), even if they’re almost indistinguishable, and both 
adults and children would be faster at comparing two bars than at comparing 
multiplication products. 
7 × 8
6 × 9
Figure 2.1 
Performing cognitive calculations 
is slower than comparing bars.
Each of these three types of cognitive oﬄoading—using tools, memory, and visual 
perception—frees up cognitive resources. Data visualization deals with the last 
type, visual perception, and focuses on optimizing ways to transcribe data into 
equivalent visual objects that the brain can process more quickly.

A False Dichotomy
Suppose you can’t remember where you parked your blue car in a huge parking 
lot. When you search for it, blue cars stand out more than red or white cars. Why 
is this?
We could view perception and cognition as a dichotomy, where perception cor-
responds to stimuli acquisition through the senses, while cognition processes 
those stimuli. However, one of the problems with this view is that we would need 
an extra-large, alien-sized brain to process all those stimuli. In fact, something 
already imposes a structure and a hierarchy of relevance to the stimuli, ﬁltering 
out much of the world around us. We call that something aention. Aention will 
help you ﬁnd your blue car and just about everything else in your life.
Our senses are not passive receptors of external stimuli. Senses act upon stimuli, 
making “selective perception” a redundant expression. Perception is always se-
lective and is always a transformer of stimuli by deﬁnition. ere is no one-way 
road to the brain. Perception and cognition are not a dichotomy.
Charts and Tables
Another false dichotomy is the one between charts and tables. Using one or the 
other is usually task-dependent, because they both have their own strengths and 
weaknesses. If it comes down to choosing one of them, think of the evaluation as 
a clinical trial. In clinical trials, a new treatment must be found more eﬀective in 
the treatment group (the trial) than in the placebo group (the control). In data 
visualization, the quality and speed of the insights provided must be beer with 
a chart (the trial) than with a table (the control); otherwise, the chart is useless 
and should be changed or deleted.
However, comparing charts and tables is a good starting point for understanding 
why perception is at the core of the visualization process. Forget those cases where 
the goal of reading a table is to get a precise value (for example, “When will the 
train arrive at the station?”), or where making all ﬁgures visible is a requirement, 
and focus instead on comparing multiple data points.
Here are two easy tasks for you: In the table at the le of Figure 2.2, ﬁnd the top 
six importing countries and the top six exporting countries, and check whether 
they are the same. is shouldn’t take long.

DATA AT WORK
28
In the table, some of the ﬁgures we need have one more digit than others have, 
making them visually more salient and helping us to complete the tasks. is 
means that the perceptual mechanisms we use in visualization also help in read-
ing the table. 
When reading a table, most tasks remain at the cognitive level. at may not be a 
problem with a small table, but as the table grows our probability of missing even 
the most basic paerns or trends also grows.
Using the chart to the right in this ﬁgure to get the answers, on the other hand, is 
simpler, faster, and almost eﬀortless. With the chart, we add a data preprocessing 
system, through which perception frees cognition from a large portion of elemen-
tary tasks, allowing us to focus on synthesis, integration, and interpretation.

Eye Physiology
Now let’s move on to a bit of eye physiology so we gain a beer understanding of 
how to design our visual representations.
Objects become visible when they emit light or when their surface reﬂects it. Light 
allows us to distinguish objects and recognize some of their properties. e eye 
is the organ we use to capture light stimuli. Figure 2.3 shows the basic process.

The Retina
e retina is the photosensitive region of the eye that covers more than two-
thirds of its inner surface. Refraction concentrates light in an 18º central arc of 
the retina, the macula lutea, where a transition from peripheral, low-resolution 
vision to central, high-resolution vision begins. We can deﬁne more concentric 
arcs, ending in the umbo, the very central point of the macula.
e horizontal axis of the chart in Figure 2.4 represents the dimensions of these arcs 
with their approximate relative proportions. It also plots the distribution of 
photoreceptor cells in the retina in a 50º section to each side of the central point. 

DATA AT WORK
30
e vertical axis represents the density of cells. It’s obvious from the chart that 
these areas have signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the type and concentration of photo-
receptor cells.
Cones
e chart in Figure 2.4 shows the concentration of the two fundamental types of 
photoreceptor cells, the cones (6 to 7 million) and the rods (120 million). Rods are 
responsible for night vision and motion detection in the peripheral areas of the 
ﬁeld of view. Since they have no signiﬁcant role in data visualization, we won’t 
discuss them here. Cones, the photoreceptor cells that we use in normal lighting 
conditions, have an opposite distribution. While their presence in the periphery is 
minimal, their density increases exponentially in the macula, peaking at the fovea, 
where their diameter is smaller, allowing for a higher resolution of the image.
ere is also some functional specialization among cones, deﬁned by their sensitiv-
ity to wavelengths at certain intervals and corresponding roughly to red, green, 
and blue. (e neuroscientist Stephen Kosslyn states that the correct colors are 
orangish-yellow, green, and violet.)¹

Figure 2.5 Cone response varies, depending on its sensitivity to wavelengths.
Cone sensitivity to red and green partly overlaps (Figure 2.5), which explains 
some of the vision issues associated with the processing of color. e inability to 
distinguish green from red is the most common form of color blindness, which 
aﬀects up to 10 percent of men (but is almost residual in women).
Kosslyn notes that because the number of blue-sensitive cones is much smaller 
than the number of other cones, it justiﬁes our inability to make subtle diﬀer-
entiations when using blue in text. In addition, blue-sensitive cones are placed 
deeper inside the retina, which can suggest a greater distance, generating some 
confusion when blue is superimposed on red (the opposite seems more “natural”).
The Arc of Visual Acuity
e central point of the retina, where the number of cones peaks, is a small frac-
tion of the total ﬁeld of view. is leads to an equally narrow arc of visual acuity. 
Stretch your arms and join your thumbs and you’ll have a good idea of the arc in 
the ﬁeld of vision with maximum acuity (Figure 2.6). Our brain spends about half 
of its visual processing power on ﬁve percent of our ﬁeld of vision.² No wonder 
it needs great management skills!

Now compare this with a digital photo. A 
high-resolution digital photo creates a large 
ﬁle because the increase in detail implies an 
increasing volume of information. However, 
while in a digital photo the resolution is 
constant, the image generated by the brain is 
dynamic and only a fraction is at maximum 
resolution. is reduces the brain’s processing 
needs. e way the brain creates the image 
gives us the illusion of a perfect view of 180°, 
and it does this so perfectly that we are not 
aware of a hole in the image at the point 
that connects the eye and the optic nerve 
(the blind spot). We ﬁnd that hole only if we 
search diligently for it.
Saccades
e periphery of our ﬁeld of vision is available at low resolution, but we can 
convert it to high resolution on demand; we just have to change our aention 
through eye movements, called saccades or saccadic movements, from one point 
of ﬁxation to the next.
Alfred Yarbus wrote one of the classic books on eye movement in 1965.³ In a study, 
he asked a subject to look at an Ilya Repin painting (Figure 2.7) and answer several 
questions. In Figure 2.8, each ellipse represents the denser areas in terms of traces 
of eye movements while the subject was searching for some of the answers.
Even when there is no speciﬁc question, it’s clear from the image that eyes don’t 
wander randomly around the scene; they’re aracted to salient features. Perhaps 
more interesting to data visualization is how the movements diﬀer according to 
the task to perform. For example, notice how, when assessing people’s age, gaze 
is focused on faces, while the assessment of how long the visitor was away also 
focuses on the same area but keeps moving from one face to the next to get an 
overall answer.
3 An English translation became available two years later: Yarbus, Alfred. Eye Movements and Vision. 
New York: Plenum Press, 1967.

In addition to the large number of eye movements, the experiment conﬁrms that 
we focus our maximum visual acuity on the points of interest. Our experience 
and knowledge (but also prejudices and misconceptions) lead us to pre-select 
the points that seem most conducive for completing the task, which again dem-
onstrates the link between perception and cognition.
Impact of Eye Physiology on Visualization
OK, Optometry 101 is over. Now, how can all that eye physiology be useful to our 
visualizations? Well, remembering the narrowness of maximum visual acuity can 
actually be very useful in planning visualizations. If we think of a chart as a unit 
of information, it’s easy to understand that we should avoid saccades because of 
their disruptive eﬀect on aention—that is, their requiring constant eye move-
ment. As a rule, between two informationally equivalent charts, the best one 
is the one that requires fewer saccades.
ere are several ways to reduce the number of saccadic movements, the ﬁrst 
of which is to reduce chart size. Oen a chart is much larger than necessary to 
convey its message. In a reduced size, there won’t be room for all objects and you 
will need to prioritize them. Textures and pseudo-3D eﬀects tend to increase im-
age size without any beneﬁts, so they’re natural candidates for exclusion.
We should also redesign certain objects that seem indispensable. Using an imagi-
nary internal monologue when reading each chart can help us understand this. 
In Figure 2.9, where the legend is outside the arc of visual acuity, the chart is 
ineﬀective for two reasons: It requires a split of aention and it forces working 
memory (see the section on working memory below) to enter into the interpreta-
tion, which disrupts the ﬂow of the story. e chart reader’s internal monologue 
might go like this:
e unemployment rates in the red and the orange countries are abysmal. Who are they? 
Let me check the legend... Ah, yes, Greece and Spain. And Portugal, where is it? It’s the 
red, no, the green line. I should memorize them all. OK, what about those with lower 
rates? Ah, Germany and the U.S. ey seem to have a similar trend in this decade.... 
Now I’m lost. Who’s the red line, again?
e second chart (Figure 2.10) eliminates both issues by directly labeling the 
series, reducing the number of saccades and freeing the reader to interpret the 
chart. e internal monologue for this chart might be:
So over the last decade, the U.S. and Germany have a similar downward trend in 
unemployment, while the rate rose dramatically in Greece and Spain.

Figure 2.9 This chart forces a split of attention, a color-matching task, and 
the use of working memory.
Figure 2.10 Directly labeling the series reduces the number of saccades 
and removes the color-matching task.
Note that placing the legend inside the arc of visual acuity would improve the 
chart, but you would still need a color-matching task between the legend and the 
lines in the chart. Removing the legend altogether and directly labeling the lines 
is the most eﬀective option.

Pre-Attentive Processing
Contrary to what our sensorial experience tells us, visual stimuli processing is 
extremely fast, but it’s not instantaneous; there is a progression in the construc-
tion of the image which becomes increasingly complex. Some basic features, like 
shape, color, or size, are processed at a faster speed. is is known as pre-aentive 
processing. It’s as if your brain drew a quick sketch of your surroundings so that 
you could decide what your aention would turn to, or, as Colin Ware writes, 
“pre-aentive processing determines what visual objects are oﬀered up to our 
aention and easy to ﬁnd in the next ﬁxation.”⁴
ink of how you see a table and a line chart. Both are made of lines—lines that 
draw numbers in a table and lines that encode the data in the chart—and both 
are pre-aentively processed. In a table, pre-aentive processing allows us to 
recognize the overall shape as a table and a particular shape as the number 8, for 
example, but it still takes a lot of work when we actually start paying aention. 
ere is not much we can infer about a table’s content with pre-aentive process-
ing alone. On the contrary, when you start paying conscious aention to a chart, 
much of the work is already done because the underlying data are transcribed 
into shapes that are processed pre-aentively.
Salience
Pre-aentive processing is a really, really good reason to make extensive use 
of data visualization. But I suspect you’re already buying into this idea, so why 
bother even discussing it? It doesn’t seem like something that you can act upon 
on a daily basis.
It turns out that there’s a really cool feature that we can manipulate when making 
charts: salience. It’s no accident that we use expressions such as “eye-catching” 
or “pops out” or even “blindingly obvious.” For some reason, objects or features 
of objects oen stand out from their surroundings in a way that draws our at-
tention. Check these randomly colored squares:

None of the squares deserve special aention because none of them have an 
aribute that makes them stand out. Now compare this to the row below. Our 
eyes are drawn to the orange square, and even if you try to ﬁxate on the ﬁrst one 
on the le, that special orange square still requires your aention:
A high level of contrast to the background or to 
other objects that makes an object stand out is an 
extremely useful characteristic of the pre-aentive 
processing. It can occur naturally in the data 
themselves (when we visualize a time series and 
there is a sudden change in a trend, for example) 
or when we design the chart in a way that makes 
a series pop out.
As Figure 2.11 shows, we could use many other at-
tributes to get similar results. Note that although in 
the last row no color stands out, the row as a whole 
stands out when considering the entire image. 
Impact of Pre-Attentive Processing 
and Salience on Visualization
If you’ve ever tried to ﬁnd Waldo (the character of the children’s book Where’s 
Waldo?), you know how frustrating it is not to have a salient feature that helps 
you ﬁnd the boy among dozens of other heterogeneous and distracting characters. 
at’s why managing the salience level of an object greatly simpliﬁes reading, 
giving the brain a hierarchical structure of stimuli relevance. is matches our 
narrative that establishes the brain as a manager, not a mere processor of raw data.
Look at the three versions of the chart in Figure 2.12. In the ﬁrst version, the 
series of interest appears clearly diﬀerentiated from a uniform background. We 
focus on the evolution of that red series, while other series exist as a backdrop. 
is would ﬁt the scenario of a manager who is evaluating a sales rep. e man-
ager doesn’t need, or want, to identify the other team members, but rather only 
to compare her performance against theirs.
Figure 2.11 You can achieve 
salience using many attributes.

38
Figure 2.12 Salience in practice.
In the second version, in the middle, we assume a neutral position, giving equal 
weight to all the series. e reduction in contrast eliminates salience. e message 
is now a comparison of equals (although, in this case, since this is an example and 
you see all versions simultaneously, you’ll be inﬂuenced by the red series on both 
sides). is now ﬁts a second scenario in which someone in a meeting with their 
team shares a chart with them, comparing the performance of each territory.
In the last version, on the right, contrast returns with line thickness, and salience 
works again, though less pronounced. e message focuses again on the thicker 
red series, but in a diﬀerent context—primus inter pares, ﬁrst among equals. is 
represents a third scenario in which someone is meeting other managers and is 
showing them how their product’s market share changed over time and how it 
compares to other major competitors.
No version is beer than another if each is designed deliberately. Each version 
represents a point of view. A measure of the quality of the visualization is its 
ability to communicate our perspective faithfully.
In the chart in Figure 2.13, the growth in health insurance expenditure is doubly 
emphasized—by color contrast to the remaining variables and by the changing 
luminance that underlines the trend aer 2010.
Another use of salience in these charts is that which makes data-encoding objects 
as a whole stand out, as opposed to supporting objects such as the grid lines, 
which are almost invisible.
When we opt for a “dump-all” strategy and use every bit of data that we can, 
the result is a spaghei chart. Behind this strategy is oen the fear of not being 
able to answer an unexpected question and therefore straying from the key mes-
sage. is is a variant of “loss aversion,” which makes us prefer avoiding losses 
to making gains. Because of loss aversion, it is only with great eﬀort that we can 
draw any conclusions from such a spaghei chart, yet it comforts us to know

Depending on our data, we don’t always have to use salience in its extreme, or else 
we’ll risk looking too bossy (“is is how you must read the chart”). In Figure 2.14, 
the le chart redraws the previous one. e way health insurance grows provides 
enough salience to make it pop out, and we can ease up, allowing the remaining 
series to be more than context. ere is, however, a world of diﬀerence between 
this chart and the one on the right, which is a colorful and useless spaghei tangle.

Salience is a powerful tool that we should use with caution, because it risks 
either resulting in an overly dichotomous message or excessively emphasizing 
a single aspect of a heterogeneous reality. However, the amount of salience that 
you should take advantage of is something you should determine with careful 
forethought, as this deﬁnes your design. If the question forces polarity, the chart 
should do the same.
It makes sense that, when striving for communication eﬀectiveness, chart design 
should be congruent with the questions you’re trying to answer. Making a chart 
is an aempt to evaluate the relevance of the data. is exercise must be done 
by the author, not by the tool. Design a chart according to your own priorities. 
A chart must be honest, but it is never neutral.
Working Memory
If you’ve rehearsed a phone number repeatedly while trying to ﬁnd a way to write 
it down and, in a moment of distraction, forgot it, it means that you’ve had con-
scious contact with working memory, the memory area where we keep chunks 
of information for immediate use. is information is then stored in long-term 
memory or eliminated and replaced by the next chunk.⁵
is experience with a phone number exempliﬁes two essential characteristics 
of working memory: its limited storage capacity and its volatility. Current studies 
suggest that three is the average number of objects that can be stored in working 
memory at any moment. is low limit, combined with pressure from outside 
to add new information, makes working memory very volatile. Blocking new 
information entry by rehearsing existing information is an eﬀective method for 
reducing volatility, but it comes at a cost, making it hard to complete tasks that 
require its availability (try reading while rehearsing a phone number).
However, the capacity of working memory is ﬂexible regarding the type and size 
of the objects that it can store. To see this in practice, memorize the following 
sequence, digit by digit:
1-4-9-2-1-9-1-4-1-9-3-9-1-9-6-9
5 In his seminal 1955 paper “e Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our 
Capacity for Processing Information” in Psychological Review, Vol. 101, No. 2: 343–352, George A. Miller 
uses the term “chunk” (whose size and nature are diﬀuse) to distinguish from “bit,” which has a more 
precise meaning.
www.ebook3000.com

2 I VISUAL PERCEPTION
41
Not an easy task, I presume. With phone numbers, a strategy that helps memo-
rization is to create groups of three digits. Let’s try it out:
149-219-141-939-196-9
Hmm…not really helpful. Let’s try again, this time with four digits:
1492-1914-1939-1969
Assuming that you know some of the most important dates in human history, 
you may think that memorizing 16 digits isn’t that hard aer all! We just moved 
from a sequence in which each digit is a unit of information to a sequence with 
four information units with four digits each. We now perceive four individual 
units, which memory recognizes as meaningful dates.
Various techniques are helpful for reducing information units. Some are universal 
(010101010101 = 6 × 01); others rely on the long-term memories shared by a large 
group of people (it would be harder to memorize historical dates of a lile-known 
country); and others are personal (imagine that 27, 17, 13, 06 are the birthdays of 
each person in your family).
Whether used to store a few facts for your next exam or in complex systems by 
participants in memory championships, mnemonics is based on this principle of 
reducing the number of units of information to memorize, increasing complexity 
of each one, and connecting to objects stored in long-term memory.
Impact of Working Memory on Visualization
Excessive use of working memory brings information ﬂow to a halt, preventing 
other brain processes from completing. A good visual representation should 
therefore include a cognitive resources conservation strategy via perceptual 
preprocessing.
We’ve seen that the narrow arc of visual acuity might leave out a chart’s legend, 
forcing us to use memory or to move our eyes back and forth to ﬁnd that legend. 
Labeling a series eliminates the need for working memory, making chart read-
ing more eﬀective.

DATA AT WORK
42
In Figure 2.15, the visualization saves working memory by not using any form of 
identiﬁcation in each series, assuming that all readers know the color code: broc-
coli is green, carrots are orange, and eggplants are purple. Of course, you should 
only risk doing something like this if you’re sure that it’s universal knowledge 
and beyond any reasonable doubt. Even then, some degree of redundancy is use-
ful (the color-blind might not be able to distinguish colors).
Managing working memory usage must be a constant concern, but this is not 
limited only to the elimination of legends. In a document, you should position 
each image close to the text to which it relates to avoid the reader having to keep 
ﬂipping pages back and forth to relate the two messages.
In a presentation, when we expect the audience to compare two charts, we should 
place them on the same slide rather than on multiple slides. How many times 
have you heard an audience ask the presenter to ﬂip the slides back and forth 
repeatedly so that they can make a comparison?
Encoding inconsistencies also require the use of memory. Multiple charts repre-
senting the same entity with diﬀerent color codes require a renewed eﬀort from 
the audience that we can avoid by ensuring consistency between the charts.

Gestalt Laws
If you take a close look at Figure 2.16, you’ll notice that the Triangulum constella-
tion (inset, upper le) is an outlier that accurately describes the location of three 
stars. Everything else seems kind of weird, at least for us. Try to ﬁnd the Musca 
(Fly) constellation.⁶ If you don’t understand how, in someone’s eyes, those stars 
turned into a ﬂy, you’re not alone, but you’ll agree that because they’re so close 
they form a group distinct from the rest.
6 Hint: It’s a small one, near Centaurus, at the boom of the central circle, and reads like “Mufca.”

Traditional constellation naming enjoys a historical legitimacy; names are the 
natural product of their authors’ cultural and social circumstances. Try going 
outside on a starry night and let your eyes and your mind wander. Slowly, you’ll 
begin to see groups of stars that remind you of the Mercedes logo, a shopping 
cart, or perhaps a ﬁsh. I can assure you that your constellations are as valid as the 
Musca. If, instead of stars, you stare at a set of randomly generated dots, you’ll 
also discover some familiar shapes.
Our eye–brain system is always making constellations—that is, gathering points 
and giving meaning to the whole. It’s the unavoidable tendency to search for 
simple shapes, since simple shapes are easier to process and consume fewer 
resources. is, again, is the thread for this chapter, but this time we have a name 
for it: Prägnanz.
Prägnanz, or “good form,” is the unifying idea of Gestalt laws, or laws of grouping, 
summarized in the well-known sentence “e whole is greater than the sum of 
its parts” (and simpler too).
Form simpliﬁcation means simplifying relationships among the components 
of the whole, emphasizing the whole and reducing the relevance of individual 
components by standardizing and generalizing relationships. is results in 
an increased weight of useful information (signal) against useless information 
(noise). (Interestingly, we could see the numbers used in the working memory 
example as the result of the search for good form.)
What shape do you see in Figure 2.17? If you answered 
“a circle,” that’s normal. In fact, it’s just a few dashes 
that the brain connects to simplify the shape. While 
we can argue that these dashes are more similar to a 
circle than a few stars are to a ﬂy, essentially it is the 
same process.
Now try to describe the shapes (A) in Figure 2.18. Our 
natural tendency is to describe them as two partially 
overlapping circles (B). Of course, nothing prevents 
reality to be (C), but then the shapes become more 
complex: Just compare the number of words you need 
to describe (B) versus (C).
Grouping and simpliﬁcation of form are core ideas in data visualization, and it 
all starts with the distances we perceive aer mapping points on the proto-chart. 
We see points near each other as a group.

Let’s look at some types of grouping without worrying about the implicit laws. 
Here is a basic display of the data points:
To create a chart, we must impose a minimum reading grid. We know from the 
data that there are two diﬀerent series, so this is the ﬁrst diﬀerentiation to make:
Our experience tells us that this distribution is compatible with a line chart, so 
connecting points of each series seems to be the obvious grouping:
Using lines to connect points is stronger than grouping them by color, and we can 
prove this if we change the connections. Introducing a vertical connection weakens 
horizontal reading and forces grouping and the reading of each pair of points:

e chart is divided into four quadrants, deﬁned by the EU-27 value for each 
variable. It’s clear that there are three groups of countries: the Western European 
countries (high GDP, high education levels), the countries of Eastern Europe (low 
GDP, high education levels), and the Mediterranean countries (low GDP, and low 
education levels).
Law of Proximity


Waldo Tobler’s ﬁrst law of geog-
raphy states that “Everything is 
related to everything, but near 
things are more related than dis-
tant things.” is is well suited to 
the law of proximity, according to 
which we see objects close to each 
other as a group and we assume 
they share the same characteristics. 
at’s something we do oen when we read a scaer plot. In the chart, we easily 
recognize as a group most of the points in quadrant Q2. When we identify the 
points, that recognition is strengthened; with the exception of Cyprus, it’s a group 
of countries of Eastern Europe (Figure 2.20). is is one of the most common laws 
used to read scaer plots, although we can ﬁnd several others on the same chart.
Law of Similarity
p p
We understand objects that share 
a common feature—such as color, 
size, or shape—as similar. In the 
chart, the red tail groups several 
countries, even if they are far apart. 
ese are the countries hit hardest 
by the ﬁnancial and sovereign debt 
crises (Figure 2.21).

e law of similarity is particularly useful 
for grouping categories. In Figure 2.22, 
the colors of the ﬁrst pie chart were cho-
sen randomly and we see 12 independent 
slices, while in the second pie chart we 
see two segmented groups, blues and 
red-yellows, or cool and warm colors.
Law of Segregation

e law of segregation tells us that objects 
within a closed shape are seen as a group. 
A frame around objects (charts or legends, 
for example) has this function, but it’s also 
useful for adding visual annotations.
e ellipse and circle drawn around countries 
reinforce their status as a coherent group, 
even if some of them don’t belong to the same 
quadrant and don’t meet one of the criteria 
(Figure 2.23). is shows the grouping power of this law, so it’s important that 
the criteria are clear and some level of redundancy is recognized (combining this 
law with the law of proximity, for example).
Law of Connectivity

e law of connectivity tells us that objects 
connected to other objects tend to be seen 
as a group. In the chart detail (Figure 2.24), 
the line connections between the data points 
(the “tails”) allow us to read each of them as 
a group.

e law of common fate tells us that objects moving in the same direction are 
seen as a group. In an animated chart, the animation helps you ﬁnd paerns in

Law of Closure
e law of closure tells us that we tend to complete forms. Examples are dashed 
lines that we see as solid, axes lines that allow us to avoid frames around the chart, 
or the connection we make between missing values. We come up with a smooth 
connection that best ﬁts the existing values. is may not match the actual data, so 
we need to exercise some caution in its assessment. Figure 2.26 exempliﬁes this.

Law of Figure/Ground
We tend to see closed objects, objects seen as a unit, or 
objects that look smaller as the object that stands out from 
the amorphous background. A clear deﬁnition of what is 
ﬁgure and what is ground helps focus aention on the 
relevant objects. In this classic optical illusion, the ﬁgure 
may be either a vessel or two proﬁles (Figure 2.27).
In a chart, the visual encoding of the data is the ﬁgure, and 
any additional elements are their support (the ground). Our 
design choices must ensure that this diﬀerentiation is clear.

Compare the two versions of the chart in Figure 2.28. In the version on the le, 
the grid lines are so noisy that they compete with the data for the leading role. In 
the chart on the right, they remain visible but work quietly, helping the reading 
and emphasizing the role of the data.

Law of Continuity
e law of continuity states that we interpret images so as not to generate abrupt 
transitions or otherwise create images that are more complex.
Values hidden behind others in a 3D chart provide a good example. Because we 
can’t see them, we can arbitrarily ﬁll in the missing elements to complete a paern. 
It’s also the case of time series, in which we assume that data points in the future 
will be a smooth continuation of the past (Figure 2.29). Recall, for example, that 
back in 2007, everyone thought home prices would never go down.

In a line chart, those series with a similar slope (that is, they appear to follow the 
same direction) are understood as belonging to the same group. In Figure 2.28, 
we divide the series into two groups: those with a downward trend and those 
with an upward trend. Also, the trend toward the upper right of many of the Q1 
countries in Figure 2.19 helps us see them as a group.
Impact of Gestalt Laws on Visualization
e above examples reinforce the idea that the Gestalt laws are manifestations of 
a more general concept of “good form.” In some cases, like the law of proximity, 
they’re clear and well deﬁned. In other cases, they don’t appear to be more than 
subtle variations of the same concept. is explains, in part, the multitude of 
new laws that were suggested over the years and appended to the original list.
Whatever image you use, the brain works tirelessly to simplify it. Although our 
power to control the images of the world around us is small, this power is much 
stronger for images we create. We should exercise this power consciously as we 
suggest how to read an image.
We should use the mechanisms of Gestalt sparingly in chart making—just enough 
to make explicit groupings, depending on the aggregation power of each law 
(Figure 2.30). For example, the law of segregation is stronger than the law of 
connectivity,⁷ and the law of connectivity is stronger than the law of proximity. 
Implicit groupings are suﬃcient to deﬁne a legend, making a frame unnecessary. 
In most cases, the chart itself does not need a frame because it’s easily perceived 
as a unit. In the line chart, on the contrary, the laws of proximity and similarity 
are insuﬃcient, and that’s why a line connecting data points is needed.
7 Assuming a fair comparison—that is, connecting and segregating lines are identical and there is 
no foreground/background relationship—a thick red connecting line in the foreground will surely 
make the law of connectivity stronger than a thin gray line in the background.

Sometimes grouping is dependent on the message in a more explicit way. Using 
the law of segregation to make it clear that all the countries of Eastern Europe 
have a similar proﬁle may be useful in the communication context.
In data visualization, the Gestalt laws probably have the broadest impact on how 
we design our visual representations.
The Limits of Perception
How sure can you be that one person is taller than another? If they stand side by 
side, I’d say you could be quite certain in most cases. What about weight? at’s 
trickier, right? e weight diﬀerence between two people must be signiﬁcant for 
you to be sure that one person is heavier than another. is seems so natural that 
we don’t question why. But…well, why? Why can we more easily discern height 
diﬀerences than weight diﬀerences?
Simply put, it’s because human perception is imperfect—imbalanced in some 
cases, unable to resolve conﬂicts in ambiguous situations, and coming up with 
absurd answers in yet other cases. Many data visualization experts have studied 
these imperfections, trying to describe them, quantify them, and ﬁnd remedies 
or alternatives because they have a direct impact on how we read a chart.
Precision varies for each retinal variable. A simple glance allows us to acknowledge 
that while comparing two adjacent columns is very accurate, comparing angles 
or areas is not as easy. In 1984, William Cleveland and Robert McGill studied how 
precise our perception is when reading retinal variables. e authors deﬁned a 
set of encodings associated to elementary perception tasks we perform before 
any task of a cognitive nature, such as reading scales or legends.
According to this empirical study, we can order the retinal variables by degree of 
precision in performing elementary tasks. Figure 2.31 shows examples of these 
tasks, ordered by degree of accuracy, according to the study.⁸

is is still a landmark study in data visualiza-
tion, and it provides a good starting point for 
becoming aware of the diﬀerences in accuracy 
of the retinal variables. However, experimental 
studies in this ﬁeld are faced with the problem of, 
on the one hand, obtaining generalizable results 
and, on the other hand, ensuring that the results 
are not contaminated by uncontrolled variables.
Some authors⁹ noted that the Cleveland study does 
not take into account the speciﬁc task (among 
other factors). e type of reading that the task 
requires can inﬂuence the ordering. In Figure 
2.32, there are minor diﬀerences between some 
values, but they’re always visible in the bar chart. 
In the pie chart, they’re almost indistinguish-
able. is is consistent with Cleveland’s results. 
However, if you want to know the proportion of 
each value in the whole, the pie chart is more 
eﬀective because, unlike with the bar chart, 
you don’t need to refer to the scale (the whole is 
already there). Later, we’ll discuss whether it’s relevant to use questions about 
proportions at all, but this example shows that the eﬀectiveness of each chart 
type is oen task-dependent.
Why We Need Grid Lines and 
Reference Lines: Weber’s Law
Being aware of the limits of our perception helps us not only to choose a display 
that respects these limits, but also to ﬁnd devices that minimize them.
Here is a concrete example: It’s easier to detect the diﬀerence in length between 
two lines of six and seven inches each than it is to detect the diﬀerence between 
two lines of 20 and 21 inches each, even though the absolute diﬀerence is the same. 
is is an example of Weber’s law, which postulates that the minimum perceptible 
diﬀerence between two stimuli is proportional to the magnitude of the stimuli.

Cleveland uses two pairs of bars to illustrate the law from a diﬀerent viewpoint, 
in comparing height (Figure 2.33). Because the bars are not aligned, determin-
ing whether they have the same height is not easy. In the ﬁrst group, nothing in 
the picture helps us to compare them. In the second version, we added two gray 
rectangles of the same height. Now it’s easy to see that the second bar is taller, 
because the section we have to compare is much smaller.
Figure 2.33 Weber’s law: Shorter 
heights are easier to compare, as 
are shorter lengths.
In a laboratory seing, the comparison of two adjacent and aligned bars is very 
accurate, but in a real-world scenario, when using a chart with multiple bars, 
the comparisons are not made solely between adjacent bars but instead among 
all bars, and accuracy decreases when comparing bars spread apart from one 
another. When we add grid lines, they work like the gray rectangles of the previ-
ous image, reducing the sections to compare.
As a reaction against the excessive weight of grid lines, people sometimes go full 
minimalist and eliminate them. Rather, in addition to justifying the existence of 
grid lines, Weber’s law also justiﬁes the inclusion of reference lines. In Figure 
2.34, the mean value of the EU is used as a reference line, making it easier to com-
pare it to the various countries, a great improvement over using an additional 
(reference) column.
Being Aware of Distortions: Stevens’ Power Law
In Figure 2.35, each bar displays the percentage of population at risk of poverty 
and social exclusion. In Italy, this risk is signiﬁcantly lower than in Bulgaria, and 
this seems very clear when comparing the bars. e bubbles encode the same 
data, but in this case, the values seem much closer because we have a tendency 
to measure the diameter of the bubbles instead of their area.

Stevens’ power law, which establishes a relationship between the magnitude of a 
physical stimulus and the perception of its intensity, explains this eﬀect. According 
to Cleveland, in the case of bars, the ratio of the magnitude and perception 
approaches 1—that is, real and perceived sizes are similar. e ratio for areas lies 
between 0.6 and 0.9, which means that smaller areas appear to be larger, while 
larger areas seem smaller, explaining the distortion when reading the bubble chart.
Context and Optical Illusions
Optical illusions show how the context and the interaction of objects lead us to 
a wrong assessment of their properties. e brain’s pursuit of “good form” is not 
always successful. We sometimes generate absurd images or create images that 
are not there from shapes that cannot be grouped. Figure 2.36 is the so-called 
Kanizsa’s Triangle, wherein we see a white triangle supported by three circles 
over another triangle. None of these objects exist as such, beginning with the 
white triangle. (is phenomenon is called “reiﬁcation,” through which the brain 
identiﬁes contours where they do not exist.)
Before the widespread use of color, it was common to use paerns to identify 
multiple series in a chart. Some combinations of paerns (most of them, actu-
ally) are annoying, because they generate a moiré eﬀect (Figure 2.37), a ﬂicker 
that gives movement to objects and changes their shape.

It doesn’t take much to guess that pseudo-3D charts are the epitome of optical 
illusions in data visualization. We’ll get back to this idea more than once in this 
book, including in the section on lying with charts.
Impact of the Limits of Perception 
on Visualization
Ensuring that true diﬀerences among and relationships between data points are 
respected when displaying them visually is central to data visualization. However, 
our perception is imperfect, and in many cases, an accurate evaluation may be 
hard to achieve. Our ﬁrst duty is to ﬁnd solutions to minimize reading errors. We 
can do this by using grid lines, reference lines, and other graphic devices or by 
adjusting the type of analysis to use the most accurate retinal variables. However, 
as noted by critics of Cleveland’s study, precision is not an absolute value. We 
must assess precision in terms of the concrete task and the level of familiarity 
with the proposed chart type.
For every rule in data visualization, there is a scenario where that rule should 
be broken. is means that choosing the best chart or the best design is always a 
trade-oﬀ between several conﬂicting goals. Our imperfect perception means that 
data visualization has a larger subjective dimension than a data table. Sometimes 
we only need this subjective, impressionist dimension and other times we need 
to translate it into hard ﬁgures. Striving for accuracy is important, but it’s more 
important to provide those insights that only a visual display can reveal.
Few people would disagree if I said that it’s necessary to have a good grasp of the 
data in order to make beer charts. And although the need for a basic under-
standing of human perception may be less obvious, it’s not less necessary. If the 
knowledge is not there, it will likely be replaced by something else—probably 
some worthless templates. Trust me; you don’t want that.
To ﬁll the vacuum, I strongly advise you to read Colin Ware’s books. Much of what 
you read in this chapter was my rather short interpretation of his work. You may 
want to start with Visual inking for Design. If you want to read a perspective 
closer to data visualization (and also heavily inﬂuenced by Ware), then check 
out Stephen Few’s Show Me the Numbers. 
To know more about the limits of perception and the work of William Cleveland, 
let me suggest his book e Elements of Graphing Data.

Takeaways
 
I
Understanding how perception and the eye–brain system work aﬀects data 
visualization in multiple ways, making your displays more eﬀective while 
saving and optimizing cognitive resources.
 
I
We have a small arc of visual acuity that forces us to constantly move 
our eyes from one point of ﬁxation to the next (the saccadic movement). 
Designing a visualization should minimize the need for this movement.
 
I
We read some features of objects, like color, shape, or size, before others, 
just like we make quick sketches before drawing an image in more detail. 
is is called pre-aentive processing, and it’s one of the reasons why 
visualization can be so eﬀective at processing data.
 
I
We can take more advantage of pre-aentive processing by making key 
objects more salient (giving them higher contrast to other objects or to the 
background), creating a hierarchy of relevance.
 
I
Working memory is another component that we should manage carefully. 
We should remove unnecessary steps for reading a chart or for comparing 
charts or objects. We should replace a legend by direct labeling, not place 
two charts on diﬀerent slides that are to be compared, and we should 
leave the short storage capacity of our working memory for more complex 
chunks of information.
 
I
e idea of “good form” that is easy to process and requires fewer resources 
can help structure a visualization, whether it contains one or multiple 
charts and other objects. Use the Gestalt laws to group objects that should 
be seen as a group by the audience.
 
I
Human visual perception is not perfect and can actually be misleading in 
many situations. In data visualization, these situations can be altogether 
avoided by using the right chart or the right format for the task or by 
rejecting pseudo-3D eﬀects. In other cases, we can minimize distortion or 
improve precision when comparing two objects far apart by using grid lines.

e eye–brain system is so essential to human beings that we can’t conﬁne it to 
the narrow limits of the individual; therefore, you can consider this chapter and 
the next as a single unit. Understanding how human perception works at the 
personal level helps us explain the formation of culture and the ability to live in 
society and, when le unchecked, the origin of preconceived ideas, prejudices, 
and stereotypes.

BEYOND VISUAL 
PERCEPTION
As you can imagine, the details behind what we’ve just covered in 
the previous chapter are inﬁnitely complex; we’ve only scratched 
the surface of how perception aﬀects data visualization. But even 
the lile we do know so far is enough to stop us from making obvi-
ous mistakes. So let’s continue by looking at the social and cultural 
aspects of visual representation.
Aer learning about the mechanics of perception, we’ll agree that 
it’s inevitable that a single red spot on a black-and-white photo will 
catch our aention; and we ﬁnd it impossible to store 50 objects in 
working memory. Does this mean that, since humans share a similar 
physiology, the way we react to stimuli or manage information is 
predictable or, even worse, mechanical?
www.ebook3000.com

3 I BEYOND VISUAL PERCEPTION
63
e answer is no, of course. (As the father of twins, I experience this ﬁrsthand, 
every single day. My twins are anything but predictable!) As we saw in the previous 
chapter, perception is not limited to receiving external stimuli and processing those 
stimuli as they are presented. e process depends on the unique characteristics 
and environment of each individual at a given time. (Reﬂect on the famous words 
of Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset: “I am I and my circumstances.”) We’ll 
discuss these social and individual contexts in this chapter. We’ll also examine 
the contexts that aﬀect how an individual produces and consumes information: 
the person and her history, the society and culture she belongs to, and the orga-
nizational microcosm where she works.
Favoring “good form” and a reduction of ambiguity extends beyond the individual 
brain and into the social organization. at is why a set of social roles and mores 
exists in each community for self-regulation in pursuit of “good social form.” e 
information analyst must always have these rules in mind when presenting data 
because they’re associated with expected behaviors. Breaking the rules incurs a 
cost (mental and otherwise).
Social Prägnanz
Human societies perpetually search for a balance between unity and diversity—
“unity without uniformity and diversity without fragmentation”—with the goal 
to create a certain stability. But our tendency for diversity is contradicted by the 
rules of social relationships, shared vision, language, and community symbols 
that together support unity.
Rules generate behavioral expectations and visions. When I take the role of “fa-
ther,” society expects that socialization has taught me the rules, and that I will 
act in accordance with those rules from the moment I assume that role (when I 
become a father).
e same happens in communication, where the rules of a language are rigid enough 
to allow sharing the code and establishing communication. When I write “chart,” 
I use some signs of a pre-established set of symbols that we call the “alphabet,” 
whose sound equivalents are known. I refer to a speciﬁc object (deﬁned or clari-
ﬁed by the context, if necessary), distinguished from any other object. But these 
rules are still ﬂexible enough to allow for a personal style in my communication.

DATA AT WORK
64
Our search for stability makes relationships among individuals within the 
ecosystem less complex and ambiguous, and lowers processing costs, our goal 
here. In this process, we generalize and create low-resolution concepts to keep 
mental costs down and cope with all the information around us. However, these 
generalizations, such as “You men/women are so…” or “All Americans are…,” 
generate perverse side eﬀects such as sexism, racism, and so on. As such, the 
data are no longer suﬃcient to characterize an entity or person—whom for 
all relevant purposes ceases to exist and is replaced by an extreme generalized 
version of the group—and leads to greater instability, exactly what mental cost 
reduction is seeking to avoid.
e positive side to this, however, is that the boundaries between unity and 
diversity—and the individual and the social—are more ﬂuid than we think. 
e brain, being the entity that manages our interaction with the environment, 
projects parts of its mechanisms in what we might call “social prägnanz.” Recall in 
Chapter 2 we discussed prägnanz—the unifying principle of Gestalt laws that 
means the pursuit of the “good form” that minimizes the need for cognitive re-
sources. If we export this concept to the social level, it means that “good social 
form” simpliﬁes social relationships. Social prägnanz is then composed of conven-
tions and rules that vary between the implicit and symbolic (the use of colors, for 
example) and the explicit and formal (the laws), conditioning and formaing the 
whole process of perception, including visual stimuli processing by the brain. 
Since change is essentially the search for a new balance, it must encompass 
this idea of social prägnanz. Change leads to increased levels of ambiguity and 
complexity and may generate resistance, particularly when it challenges core 
knowledge, beliefs, or past practices. So when is change acceptable for establish-
ing new rules and ideas?
Breaking the Rules
Rules and social conventions create a uniform and predictable background. 
When one person breaks the rules, it adds mental processing costs to the people 
it aﬀects. It’s like being a tourist in a diﬀerent culture. At the same time, it gen-
erates something akin to salience in pre-aentive processing, to which we are 
naturally drawn: A change in circumstances is the basis of any good story that 
aracts our aention. But if there are multiple and simultaneous changes, they 
become hard to reconcile.

It isn’t diﬃcult to ﬁnd an example in which perceptual and social dimensions 
intertwine. Imagine someone dressed in bright red at a funeral, where everyone 
else wears dark colors. is would be salient with respect to a uniform color con-
text. But beyond the chromatic eﬀect, there is also a symbolic dimension due to 
the breaking of the social rule that censors red at funerals. Naturally, we’ll want 
to know who that rule breaker is, what kind of relationship she had with the 
deceased, and why she dresses that way in that environment.
In a young ﬁeld like data visualization, questioning established ideas is a condi-
tion of growth, and we shouldn’t be afraid of breaking the rules. Breaking the 
rules in data visualization has two very diﬀerent meanings. e ﬁrst is a vendor-
sponsored rule breaking, those baseless practices suggested by some soware 
applications (including Excel), of which the epitome is the pseudo-3D pie chart. 
ey go against what we currently know about human visual perception and 
undermine data visualization eﬀectiveness. roughout this book, we’ll ﬁght 
against these baseless practices and implicit rules.
e second meaning is test-breaking cultural, perceptual, and visualization rules, 
and seeing how that may aﬀect how we read graphic representations. We’ll see 
that breaking the rules oen has more costs than beneﬁts, but sometimes, aer 
an initial awkwardness, breaking the rules may prove very useful.
The Tragedy of the Commons
How do you aract aention and keep an audience interested? If you want to ﬁnd 
a serious divide in the data visualization community, this seemingly innocent 
question will serve you quite well. On one hand, a designer gets so excited aer 
hearing that his data visualization must “aract aention” that he runs back to 
his computer and fails to follow through with the “keep the audience interested” 
part. On the other end of the spectrum, you get Edward Tue’s famous quote: “If 
the statistics are boring, then you’ve got the wrong numbers.”
ink of this in terms of the well-known “tragedy of the commons.” e rational 
self-interest of each member of a group (sheep herders, for example) when using 
a common resource (the commons, or pasture) can work against the interest of 
the group as a whole, if it results in exploiting the resource beyond its sustain-
able level. In other words, what is good for the individual is not necessarily so 
for the group.

In this case, aention is the commons, a ﬁnite and, these days, valuable resource. 
Imagine graphic designers as herders, taking their portfolio to graze in this 
common pasture. (is also applies to heavy users of special eﬀects in Excel and 
PowerPoint.) Aracting aention is easy (salience in pre-aentive processing will 
help), especially for someone with a modicum of artistic talent. But while it may 
seem rational from an individual point of view, if everyone kept creating highly 
unusual images just to aract aention, we’d soon deplete this resource and pollute 
the visual landscape by creating a strongly heterogeneous background, making 
contrast harder to create and ruining salience for everyone. Add to this that we 
now have online access to automatic infographics generators; the audience may 
decide these objects require more aention than they’re willing to spare.
e pie charts in Figure 3.1 provide an example at the chart level. e pie on the 
le aracts aention to the ﬁrst slice. en it’s as if the other slices get envious and 
want more aention too. So the competition gets ﬁerce and, in the end, everyone 
loses. e overall eﬀect is that of a useless increase in noise and processing costs 
and a reduced aention pool.
Figure 3.1 Pie charts: from acceptable to wretched.
One of my pet peeves is the expression “a memorable and professional look” that 
many vendors use to describe the charts made by their applications. Well, the best 
of these charts are usually “memorable” for the wrong reasons (overly emphasiz-
ing design and eye-candy), and the “professional look” usually means that they 
included some irrelevant eﬀects that happen to be missing in Excel or PowerPoint.
ink of memory as a non-renewable resource that you’ll want to keep using at 
a sustainable level. In an organizational environment, you don’t need to make 
memorable charts. If you wish to do so (from time to time), you must ﬁrst look 
within the data for the reason why your chart should be memorable.

In the example in Figure 3.2, the memorable dimension of the chart is the expo-
nential growth of unemployment in Greece. e author broke a rule by deﬁning 
a ﬁctitious border, forcing the series line to go beyond the frame and thereby 
emphasizing the drama that is already there (the word “skyrocketing” also made 
the point). Again, this is something that you should do at a sustainable level 
(meaning rarely), and only if the data justiﬁes it.
Although a keen-eyed reader could criticize this chart because the exponential 
growth is fueled in part by its (hidden) real aspect ratio, not the one deﬁned by 
the visible border, this is balanced out by the series for the entire European Union 
(EU-28) that acts as a reference. Always a good practice, but even more valuable 
when breaking a rule: Add more series to make relative comparisons possible.

Color Symbolism
Say it quickly: “She sells seashells by the seashore.” Tongue twisters are usually 
correct but hard-to-articulate sentences requiring deep concentration. e 
chart in Figure 3.3 is, by comparison, a visual version of a tongue twister (an 
eye twister, perhaps?). It displays the availability of three vegetables: carrots, 
broccoli, and eggplant.
Do you feel comfortable reading the chart? I don’t, because the strong association 
between vegetables and color is broken. Usually, carrots are not green, broccoli 
is not purple, and eggplant is not orange.¹ Also, having to read the legend when 
the lazy designer (that would be me) could make things much easier is annoy-
ing. ings can get bad if you mess up traditional symbolic uses: pink and blue 
for the wrong genders, red and blue for the wrong political parties, faulty team 
colors, and so on.² 
Playing with color symbolism is rarely justiﬁed and has no advantages over the 
long run, because in most cases long-standing color associations are unlikely to 
change in the short to medium term. Country ﬂags rarely change, Coca-Cola is 
likely to remain red, and women will not be wearing bright red dresses to funer-
als any time soon.
1 is can be seen as a variation of the Stroop eﬀect.
2 By the way, if you want to ﬁght prejudice (for example by not using pink for female, if you think 
of it that way), don’t simply opt to reverse color coding; it generates the same sterile confusion of the 
chart in Figure 3.3. Instead, choose colors that have no symbolic meaning in that context.

Representing Time
e way we represent time (and think about it) in the Western world is common 
across society. Time ﬂows from le (older) to right (newer). In the le-hand chart 
of Figure 3.4, I’ve removed all labeling. Assuming a “normal” le-to-right time 
ﬂow, you’ll likely conclude that both series are trending down. In reality you‘d 
be wrong. e version on the right with its labels shows that the opposite is true; 
there is an upward trend in both series.
In this particular example, the reader could suspect that the chart goes against 
convention because a downward trend in broadband Internet connection is 
unlikely. In cases where there are no expectations, this alert sign may not be 
present and the chart will lead us to draw opposite conclusions to what the data 
tell us. So there is a real danger that the reader won’t be able to make correct 
perception-based conclusions (in this case, values decreasing when read from 
le to right) until aer the cognitive task of reading the horizontal axis (the 
values are increasing). is is a capital sin in data visualization, and you should 
try to avoid it at all costs: In a chart, cognitive tasks complement perceptual 
tasks and should never correct them. Heck, what’s the point of making quick-
to-read charts if your audience can’t trust them? If “trust but verify” should be 
your audiences’ moo, it’s your job to make sure the “trust” part is not missing.

Axis Folding
Conventions tell us that the y values move away from the origin continuously, 
sometimes in two opposite directions (up and down, positive and negative). e 
horizon chart in Figure 3.5 breaks these conventions of continuity and direction 
of the y-axis. It shows by how much the unemployment rate in West Virginia

diverged from the national average over the years. Red tones mean that the rate 
is higher, while blue tones mean the rate is lower. e larger the gap, the darker 
the tone.³ In other words, both the positive and negative values of the y-axis 
fold over themselves, and color and shade become the means of diﬀerentiation.
It’s OK if you don’t ﬁnd the chart easy to understand. Take your time to overcome 
the initial strangeness because it really pays oﬀ. e horizon chart is one of the 
best examples of eﬀective rule breaking. It minimizes unused real estate, allowing 
for a much higher density of data points compared to traditional techniques.
Don’t Make Me Think!
ere can be several reasons why someone breaks the rules, whether from igno-
rance, malice, or the sincere desire to ﬁnd a more eﬀective way to explore the data 
or communicate the results. Whatever the reason, breaking the rules frustrates 
the audience’s expectations and will incur a cost. Sometimes you might consider 
this an investment, while oen it is nothing more than waste.
In Don’t Make Me ink! A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, Steve Krug’s 
well-known book on interface design, he shows that the user must ﬁrst under-
stand that a certain object on a screen is a buon and that its use then triggers a 
set of predictable actions. In data visualization, the way a chart is read should be 
so obvious to the reader that it becomes almost invisible; the reader can focus on 
what the chart says and not on its design. It should also be predictable in the sense 
outlined previously: ere must be a consistency between perception and cognition. 
I asked you above to spend some time geing familiar with the horizon chart. You 
may point out that this contradicts the idea that a chart should be obvious, and 
rightly so. But sometimes we need to introduce more complex charts and improve 
literacy; otherwise we’ll be using Big Data to make pie charts. In other words, if 
you have a complex dataset (which doesn’t necessarily mean big), you don’t want 
to oversimplify it because of a lack of skills. Aer a chart type becomes obvious, 
we should be allowed but not required to think about its design.
3 We’ll discuss this chart type in more detail in Chapter 13, where you can see the full chart with all 
the states.

Steve Krug doesn’t want you to stop thinking. Instead he’s saying that a well-
designed interface frees cognitive resources so that tasks are executed more 
eﬃciently. is is what we’ve been discussing since the beginning of the book: 
Perception frees us of basic tasks of data analysis if we have the right chart and 
the right design. If Krug’s book had a more explicit title, it might be Don’t Make 
Me ink, So at I Can ink.
Literacy and Experience 
Both human perception and culture inﬂuence the way we read visual representa-
tions, but we don’t deﬁne an individual by the physiology of the brain and the rules 
of the social whole. Context, knowledge, emotions, experiences, and memories 
contribute to a personal and unpredictable interpretation.
Graphic Literacy
If an audience can’t read a particular type of chart, it becomes as useless as speak-
ing in an unfamiliar foreign language. “Know your audience” is a mantra you 
can apply to all types of communication, and data visualization is no diﬀerent. 
Communicating eﬀectively without dumbing down your message is always a 
challenge. You don’t want your audience glued to the dictionary, looking up words 
it doesn’t understand, but some unfamiliar terms may prove necessary to ensure 
that your message is not corrupted, so they should be introduced and explained.
Tailoring the message to the audience should not be synonymous with accepting its 
prejudices, routines, and the usual ways of doing things. Many of what we believe 
to be good data visualization principles are opposite to what is practiced within 
organizations. When presenting a chart type the audience is unfamiliar with, 
or when breaking a rule, the author must argue for its advantages. Annotating 
the chart, showing how to read it, drawing aention to key points, and making 
direct comparisons with alternative representations will help the audience feel 
safer in their reading and possible adoption of the new chart.

An Unknown Chart: The Bamboo Chart
The strip plot in Figure 3.6 compares the risk of poverty and social exclusion in the 
European Union, highlighting one of the richest countries (Norway) and one of the 
poorest (Bulgaria).
What if we want to go deeper and compare socio-demographic groups? A bar chart, 
like the one in Figure 3.7, oﬀers a solution. It compares the same countries again and, 
because of the background references, there is a little improvement over the simple 
point-to-point comparisons we usually get from a bar chart. The problem with this 
bar chart is that we are no longer able to see the countries in the context of the EU.
The easiest solution is to use both charts, where the strip plot adds context and the 
bar chart adds detail. This may not be enough if we want to say something like “a male 
living alone in the UK has a higher risk than the average risk in Greece.”
Is it possible to combine both perspectives? Let’s see. In Figure 3.8, each vertical line 
represents a country, so it’s similar to the strip plot. The lines for Norway and Bulgaria 
are selected. I named this a “bamboo chart,” where the vertical lines are the canes and 
the horizontal lines are the leaves. Each leaf shows by how much each group departs 
from the national average. In both countries, men have a little lower risk of poverty 
than women, the gap being higher in Bulgaria. In many countries, there is no gap, so 
we can assume gender is not a signiﬁcant risk factor.
Now let’s check if the level of income aﬀects the risk. Figure 3.9 shows that there is a 
huge impact (obviously!), but it’s not identical in both countries. In Bulgaria, if you’re in 
the ﬁrst quintile of income (the lowest income group), the risk is absolute (100%), while 
in Norway, the risk is “only” over 60%. As you can see, in Bulgaria income inﬂuences 
risk much more than in Norway. It’s also interesting to note that only the top income 
quintile in Bulgaria enjoys a risk similar to the national level in Norway.
There are many more groups and countries, so this analysis could go on and on. Your 
natural reaction (for the second time this chapter) may be of some strangeness, 
skepticism, or even resistance, either to this or to any other new chart. This is one of 
the reasons why many media do not publish more charts that are complex. A lack of 
knowledge and familiarity combined with a short attention span make the chart diﬃcult 
to comprehend and increases the likelihood that readers will ignore it.
When you encounter a new chart type that goes beyond mere decoration, spend 
some time studying it, and try to imagine what the data would look like in a chart type 
you’re familiar with. Then decide whether the new chart adds enough value to your 
data visualization resource kit.

But even the best-case scenario is likely to meet resistance. e more the previous 
chart type was integrated into the organization’s workﬂow, the more disruptive the 
new proposed chart becomes. ink of the population pyramid, for example. It’s 
a symbol of population studies, and everyone in the ﬁeld knows how it should be 
read and what each population proﬁle means. It is also a bad chart, so any changes 
should be made in small steps. Displaying males and females on the same side of 
the axis or using lines instead of bars would improve it without much disruption.
Familiarity with the Subject
e visual representation of invariant data points—or the opposite, data points 
that vary randomly—is irrelevant. To be useful, a visualization must display 
variability that makes sense to the audience. Even if an observer detects a 
paern, it only makes sense if there is a contextual knowledge that allows for 
its interpretation.
Unlike the bamboo chart, the chart in Figure 3.10 is well known. Everyone rec-
ognizes an electrocardiogram and is able to detect those very clear paerns. e 
problem is that these paerns are meaningless if you don’t have a medical back-
ground to determine whether these are the typical paerns of a healthy heart. 
In an extreme case, not only is the interpretation of the paerns impossible, but 
the paerns themselves are invisible to those who lack the knowledge to detect 
them (such as with a nonprofessional trying to interpret a chest X-ray).
is example shows an important limitation of data visualization that we oen 
forget: A new chart type might allow us to process more information, but we must 
be provided with context or prior knowledge in order to make it meaningful. An 
eﬀective chart is a piece of a jigsaw puzzle whose place is known or guessed: We 
know that the piece will help us understand a problem and we know its general 
location (the section of the problem it covers), and the moment we interlock it 
with the other pieces, its full meaning is ﬁnally revealed.
Figure 3.10 It’s easy to see patterns in an electrocardiogram, but you need professional 
knowledge to interpret them.

Information Asymmetry
is relates to the very useful concept of “information asymmetry.” is means that 
there is a knowledge gap between, for example, the producer and the consumer. 
Suppose the producer exploits this gap to claim health beneﬁts of consuming 
its products based on some pseudo-scientiﬁc evidence. Most consumers can 
detect this sound of science, but because they lack the contextual knowledge, they 
can’t actually fully understand the meaning of the message and tend to accept it 
because it’s “scientiﬁc evidence.”
ere will always be strong information asymmetry between people or social 
groups simply because we can’t all be specialists in everything. We need someone 
to bridge the gap on demand—for example, today I’m interested in earthquakes 
and want someone to explain to me how the “Modiﬁed Mercalli Intensity Scale” 
works in a way that, like a piece of the jigsaw puzzle, interlocks with my previous 
knowledge. I don’t have to remind you of how brilliant Carl Sagan was at explain-
ing the cosmos for us. Journalists also bridge this gap, translating complex issues 
into something the layperson can understand.
Visuals can be very helpful in this translation. Keeping with the jigsaw puzzle 
image, they replace the missing piece with a simpler one, with ﬂexible anchor 
points that make it easier to interlock with the existing pieces. A specialist read-
ing an unemployment rate of 13.8 percent realizes the implications, while the 
nonprofessional lacks this sensibility. However, if a chart shows how the rate 
evolved over time, a comparison to other countries, and what is normal and what 
goes beyond normal, the chart does not make the nonprofessional an expert, but 
it creates the basic anchor points that he uses to understand the information.
Inside an organization, information asymmetry is much lower and, in each area, 
people are basically on the same page. Visuals are useful for data exploration, 
communicating ﬁndings, and, hopefully, supporting decisions and not so much 
to ﬁll deep knowledge gaps.
Organizational Contexts
While culture and social rules provide a generic behavior framework, the profes-
sional organizations we belong to tend to be more normative and explicit on the 
output they expect from us, and peer pressure is more palpable. Being a popular 
activity in organizations, data visualization reﬂects its internal culture and the 
many factors shaping it.

DATA AT WORK
76
Wrong Messages from the Top
We oen take for granted that charts, due to their ability to show relationships 
between data points, are superior to tables when the task requires such an approach. 
e choice seems obvious, so if someone from top management prefers a good 
data table, that will cause some uproar among data visualization enthusiasts. But 
instead of a sermon on the virtues of data visualization, let’s think a bit about the 
possible reasons for using a table when it doesn’t seem the right choice.
In senior positions, many of the hard data paerns are already internalized, so there 
can be multiple ways of dealing with new data. A popular stereotype, only partially 
conﬁrmed by my own experience, says that senior managers prefer to use tables 
and they devalue charts as tools of knowledge acquisition and decision support, 
feeding the perspective of charts as merely illustrative and decorative items.
ey may prefer tables because they are accustomed to them, or because it’s easier 
to go along with a vendor’s sales pitch and bad application defaults. In the end, 
they will always rely on hard ﬁgures to make decisions.
I’d like to suggest that people using tables for decision support are less aware of 
the paerns in the data (which are already internalized) and are more interested 
in a ﬂuctuation band against which they compare the new data. is means that as 
long as my market share doesn’t vary more than 1 percent, there are beer ways to 
spend my time than staring at a bunch of charts. is is an interesting technique 
for data reduction and it’s the result of a mature and consolidated knowledge. 
It’s also very eﬃcient in decision-making, as it helps in looking beyond short-
term ﬂuctuations. However, in a constantly and rapidly changing environment, 
this approach is less sensitive to unexpected but signiﬁcant changes. Returning 
to the unemployment rate in Greece, for more than 10 years we could safely say 
that the rate would ﬂuctuate around 10 percent. en suddenly, it skyrocketed 
to almost 30 percent (Figure 3.11). We’re not in Kansas anymore.
Unfortunately, when top managers don’t use visuals for relevant tasks, this oen 
translates into bad formal organizational guidelines. If, for example, you must 
use slide templates that allocate much of the slide real estate to branding, leaving 
only a tiny rectangle for actual content, you know that the guidelines and process 
standardization rules have really gone overboard.
Many of my clients are local branches of multinational corporations. is means 
that their reporting must comply with headquarter guidelines. Much of the time, 
the local client and I feel handcuﬀed by guidelines that impose a set of bad prac-
tices worldwide, but occasionally a local report is recognized as “best practice” 
and starts moving toward corporate adoption.

Charts conﬁrming what these managers already know (or sense) reinforce their 
predisposition, so the right strategy must be ﬁnding “pain points” through visu-
alizations that show relevant but unexpected paerns and complex relationships 
that are not acquired by reading a table.
Impression Management
An organization is a complex ecosystem made of standard practices and culture, 
peer pressure, tension between technical and social skills, and strong competi-
tion for scarce resources in a collaborative context necessary for the pursuit of 
the organization’s mission and goals.
In a context of low graphic literacy, poorly designed soware defaults, and a 
focus on impression management,⁴ data visualization has a great capacity to 
provide the “wow factor.” If managers favor eye-candy, this will yield catastrophic 
results, where a string of pseudo-3D charts and special eﬀects in PowerPoint can 
signiﬁcantly reduce the return on investment on the data.
Of course, the impact of PowerPoint’s canned special eﬀects will fade away with 
their constant use, resulting in the search for more unique and spectacular 
stimuli, which will further degrade the message: e pie becomes a 3D pie, the 
3D pie becomes an exploded 3D pie, and the exploded 3D pie becomes an exploded 
3D pie with ﬂying slices.
4 Impression management is the conscious eﬀort by individuals to adapt their public image to their 
goals and to control other people’s perceptions about them.

Market research companies (who could otherwise contribute toward visualiza-
tions of their own data that are more eﬀective and thus generate a higher return 
for their clients) tend to replicate this situation—the logic being “that’s what 
the client wants.”
is vicious cycle of overstimulation that feeds upon itself (and reinforces the 
idea that charts are entertaining but ultimately useless in the decision-making 
process) is diﬃcult to break with a perspective that emphasizes the content 
and manages the inﬂow of visual stimuli according to the needs of the message. 
Overstimulation is like a drug, and withdrawal is not easy.

Don’t be afraid of testing a new way of displaying your data if you believe it 
adds value over traditional chart types, but think of it as a new word. You 
must deﬁne it, show examples of how to use it, and advocate its advantages 
over previous concepts.

At the organizational level, some inhibiting factors may prevent the devel-

should make an eﬀort to ingrain data visualization principles and best

aware of how soware defaults are important and how you can change 
them to meet your priorities.

DATA PREPARATION
Jacques Bertin deﬁnes his semiology of graphics as a “visual tran-
scription of a data table.” In a perfect world, this table materializes 
in front of us when we need it, ready to use. In everyday reality, 
however, things involve more sweat and less magic. People coined 
the expression “data janitor” for a reason.
In a data visualization project, data extraction costs and data prepa-
ration are oen overlooked, either by management that doesn’t 
understand the level of detail required or by data analysts making 
overly optimistic assumptions. is translates into many hours of 
data cleansing that most people don’t see. If not taken into account, 
these labor-intensive tasks can consume several times the resources 
available for a project, whether it’s a simple chart for an upcoming 
meeting or an organization-wide project.

DATA AT WORK
80
Brilliant visualizations cannot redeem bad data, either in content or in struc-
ture. Many spreadsheet users are not familiar with well-structured data, and 
that’s one more reason to discuss data preparation.
We can summarize all preparation work on the data table, regarding both structure 
and content, by the acronym ETL, for Extract, Transform, and Load. ETL is just as 
applicable to your Excel ﬁles as it is to large, formal systems.
is chapter is not strictly about data visualization. If the tables you need actually 
materialize in front of you, ready to use, if you know how to structure the tables 
to take advantage of pivot tables, and if you organize sheets in your workbook 
by content type, it’s probably safe to skip this chapter. In a more sophisticated 
organization, most of the issues discussed here are not relevant, and most of the 
data comes from internal systems. However, many people still struggle with these 
basic issues, so if you’re in this category, read on.
Problems with the Data
Let’s split data problems into two broad categories: 1) structure without content, 
and 2) content without structure. e ﬁrst category aﬀects our data in particular; 
the second is common in data we get from other sources.
Structure without Content
Even if you’ve never seen a table for which multiple users can enter data (such 
as a table for telemarketing operators), you can imagine how much garbage data 
is collected: incomplete ZIP codes, multiple abbreviations for the same entity, 
misspellings, logical inconsistencies…you name it.
It’s challenging to deﬁne good data validation rules without forcing exclusions: 
What happens when a few ZIP codes are missing from a lookup table? Suppose, 
though, that you can maintain a table with a minimum number of errors. Figure 
4.1 represents an example of such a table. To make things more interesting, try 
linking this table to a second table containing other personal data (Figure 4.2). 
First, you’ll have to split the ﬁeld Name into Name and Surname, to be able to join 
both tables. Now, is John Doe in the ﬁrst table the same person referred to as John 
F. Doe in the second table? e solution in these cases is to have common ﬁelds 
in both tables that are not subject to diﬀerent interpretations (social security or 
driver’s license numbers are good candidates). If there are no safe common ﬁelds,

81
you’ll need to allocate additional resources to determine whether it’s the same 
person. Multiply this process by thousands of records and you have a problem 
on your hands that, if not anticipated, would generate serious time and resource 
management issues.
A few other special cases also belong to the category of structure without content. 
One of the most common is a break in a time series, whereby you still get the same 
measure (an unemployment rate, for example), but changes in methodologies, 
concepts, technologies, or regional administrative boundaries make comparisons 
meaningless. Or, at least, comparisons must be carried out with extra care—the 
same care you should use when comparing countries that use diﬀerent ways of 
measuring the same reality. For example, infant mortality rate depends on how a 
country deﬁnes “live birth.” Because the deﬁnition is not the same across coun-
tries, this may aﬀect country rankings in international comparisons.¹
Content without Structure
Suppose you’re a data provider, perhaps at the U.S. Census Bureau or at a small 
public relations company. e moment you release the data, you cease control-
ling it. You don’t know how people will read and reuse the data. ey may want to 
cross-check it if they suspect that the data is not telling the whole story. Or they 
will misunderstand the concepts. Whatever they do, ﬁrst they must have access 
to the data in a format they can use.
Providers oen make it hard to use the data beyond the format in which they 
released it; they’re oen unaware of this issue or focus on the end user and forget 
the data professional, who probably needs a more speciﬁc format.

Data providers should then ask themselves two simple questions: How many 
data reuse issues are we causing by releasing the data in this format? Is this reuse 
friction level acceptable for our data dissemination goals?² Typical answers are, 
respectively, “a lot” and “no.” e end result is that data reuse friction levels can 
range from none (rare), to mildly annoying, to a source of a barrage of unprint-
able curses.
Let me give you an unfair example. Suppose you want to know the military budget 
as a percentage of GDP in each country. ere are several sources, but you could 
start with the CIA’s website publication e World Factbook. Country proﬁles in 
the Factbook contain several sections and subsections.
Figure 4.3 displays the Military section for the United Kingdom. You can manu-
ally open this section and copy the data you need for each country, or you could 
use a scraping tool that automates the process. If you’re unable to automate the 
process, you’ll have a few long and boring days ahead of you. Because the data 
are not displayed the way you need it, time and resource costs will increase since 
you’ll have to structure it ﬁrst.
2 I’m not implying they do it on purpose; they may not be able to reduce friction due to technological 
reasons.

I said this is an unfair example because the Factbook actually allows us to jump 
between the country proﬁle level and the list level. At the boom of the page on 
the website, you’ll see “country comparison to the world: 28.” If you click the 
number 28, you’ll get a list of all countries sorted by military expenditures as a 
percentage of GDP. en you can choose a country from that list and return to 
the proﬁle view. is nice feature is still quite rare, unfortunately.
ese two broad categories of structure without content and content without 
structure try to make sense of the variety of issues when using data presented 
in an unfriendly format. Hadley Wickham brilliantly captured the diﬀerence 
between well-structured and poorly structured data in an excellent article³ in 
which he quotes the ﬁrst paragraph of Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina: “Happy fami-
lies are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” e “happy 
family” dataset is structured according to some rules that make it similar to other 
“happy families,” while there is a virtually inﬁnite number of ways to create 
an unhappy dataset.
What Does “Well-Structured 
Data” Mean, Anyway?
e acronym GIGO (garbage in, garbage out) summarizes the issues we deal with 
every day: Results and insights depend on data quality. We can handle data 
critically (being aware of the “garbage” and factoring it in to the evaluation of 
results) or uncritically (“if the data has been subject to extensive processing by 
the computer, it can’t be wrong”).
Data integrity becomes essential when the volume of data increases and we need 
to update, ﬁlter, and aggregate it, and use data as a basis for derivative calcula-
tions. A clean, consistent, and well-structured table means lower update and 
maintenance costs and more ﬂexibility to multiply the perspectives from which 
we can analyze the data.
is may not be good news for the user accustomed to the loose spreadsheet 
environment, where storage, presentation, intermediate calculations, and 
parameters oen share the same sheet. Let’s start untangling this mess with a 
concrete example.
3 Wickham, Hadley. “Tidy Data.” Journal of Statistical Soware, Vol. 59, No. 10, August 2014. 

DATA AT WORK
84
e ﬁrst step toward improving data structures is understanding that storing data 
and presenting data are two very diﬀerent things. You should never use storage 
and presentation features together in a single worksheet. Share your source table 
if requested, of course, but otherwise bury it deep down in a data-only sheet. 
If you have a well-structured table, you’ll never have to touch it again, except 
when using a client like a pivot table or when adding a variable. In Excel, tables 
are for storing data, and pivot tables are for analyzing and presenting data.
A Helping Hand: Pivot Tables
Ah, pivot tables! Pivot tables are great at many levels. ey can even serve as 
a litmus test for checking how well a table is structured. If every single cross-
tabulation is done easily and you don’t have to change the pivot table following 
an update, you can be reasonably sure that you have a well-structured table.
Figure 4.4 shows a sample of one of the output formats for the Consumer 
Expenditure Survey. Assuming we know the meaning of the Series ID, this is the 
typical manner of presenting the data, with time periods in columns and entities 
in rows.
Figure 4.4 Sample output from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (Bureau of Labor 
Statistics).
ink of the table as a cross tabulation (Series ID × Year) that must be uncrossed 
so that we can use it. Unlike other output formats from the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, you can get all the data you need in a single table, and it’s very easy to 
reverse it to the right format, resulting in the table you see in Figure 4.5.

Series ID contains multiple variables, so we must parse it and look for the descrip-
tive text for each code. Figure 4.6 shows how the ﬁnal table will look.

Creating dynamic charts in Excel requires knowledge of advanced formulas, 
but oen we only need them because the data table is not properly structured. 
Figure 4.7 shows a simple dynamic chart (not a pivot chart) that you can create 
without a single formula. It displays the proportion of food expenditure away 
from home, over the years, for the selected income quintile. Select a diﬀerent 
quintile and the chart will update.
From Figure 4.6 we can see that a well-structured table is essentially a list of 
observations and their characteristics (category and item, income quintile, 
and time) and the associated measure (expenditure). In a pivot table, measures 
are usually placed in the Values area, while characteristics go into the Rows, 
Columns, or Filters areas.
Figure 4.6 A few rows of the ﬁnal data table.

DATA AT WORK
86
In a well-structured table that can be easily used as a pivot table source, the content 
of each column must be understood as a group (years, quintiles), and the values 
in each measure should be comparable (expenditure in dollars in a column and 
expenditure units in a second column).
Reality can get more complicated, and so will the structure. Suppose you get 
expenditure by gender. Ideally, you’d add a new column (“Gender”) with two values 
(Male, Female). But if they are averages instead of totals, you can’t aggregate them, 
and, in this case, you have to add them as measures.
Extracting the Data
You successfully complete the ﬁrst stage in the ETL process when you access a 
ﬁle that you can edit and manipulate. When you get a text ﬁle, you may need to 
open it in a text editor (such as the free Notepad++ for Windows) to solve multiple 
small issues with Search and Replace. Do your computer’s regional seings and 
the text share the same symbols for decimal places and thousands separators? 
(Some may use periods while others use commas.) Are there any strange char-
acters? Can they be removed?
Extraction can be a very long and rocky journey, so let’s start with a smooth ex-
ample ﬁrst, again from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I’m looking for the monthly 
unemployment rate, at the state level, for a period of several years. Figure 4.8 
shows a sample of the output. ere are several output options, including an 
Excel ﬁle, but for now we’ll work with a tab-delimited text ﬁle. I’m geing the 
data for each state, which means that I’ll have to consolidate them into a single 
table, removing all unwanted text.

Figure 4.8 Pasting data into Excel, from a web page and from a text editor.
Figure 4.8 explains why you should have a text editor between a web page and 
the spreadsheet. Scenario 1, on the le, shows the result of a direct paste from the 
web page, while scenario 2 shows what happens when you paste to Notepad++ 
ﬁrst: Excel recognizes the tab character and automatically parses the text.
As with the example on expenditure, we’ll have to ﬁnd what the Series ID codes 
mean. You may want to split the Series ID codes into multiple columns using 
the Text to Column function in Excel. Also, create a real date from the Year and 
Period columns. 
When extracting data from other public sources, you may run into some limits 
imposed by the organization. e United Nations Population Division doesn’t 
allow you to select more than ﬁve variables or countries in each query (Figure 4.9). 
Other organizations impose limitations at the cell level. e Eurostat limits each 
query to 750,000 cells. Depending on how high the limit is or how detailed are 
the data you need, you may have to run multiple queries to get all the data and 
then merge the results into a single ﬁle.

The PDF Plague
With more or less pain, the chance of geing a text ﬁle from oﬃcial statistical 
oﬃces is high. Other data providers, such as professional associations, may have 
other, more restrictive policies regarding data dissemination.
Many years ago, I needed to get data on the various types of electricity consump-
tion (high voltage, low voltage, domestic, industrial, public roads, and so on) 
at a very detailed regional level. e data were available only in large sheets of 
paper, where someone had elegantly handwrien all these thousands of values. 
It was an admirable job, almost worthy of a Charles Dickens novel. It also had an 
unanticipated cost, because my organization had to purchase a copy of all those 
sheets and hire someone to enter the data manually.
Today, no sane organization would share its data in this format. With all the 
technology we have in our hands, that would be ridiculous, right? Well, not so 
fast. Let’s abstract for a moment from the technology and focus on the goal: 
geing a few thousand values into an editable table. Now tell me: What diﬀerence 
does it make if we have handwrien numbers on a sheet of paper or a PDF ﬁle 
with such a twisted formaing that the cost of extracting the data is higher than 
entering them by hand? Actually, there is a diﬀerence: I found those handwrit-
ten sheets only once, while I keep stumbling upon data tables in PDF ﬁles, to my 
despair and exasperation.

If you’re a data provider, you have a degree of control over your data when you 
share them in a PDF. You might persuade some people not to use the data in a way 
diﬀerent than you intend. is is not wrong if you have a strong reason to do it, 
but it will anger your users, even if that’s not your plan. Again, make sure that 
the way you share your data is aligned with your goals. In addition to presenting 
your data the way you want people to see it by default, provide a link to the raw 
data. at way everyone is happy.
If you’re a user of internal data, you might assume that you’ll never have to ex-
tract data from PDF ﬁles. But, sooner or later, you will. And there will not be a 
quick ﬁx. You may be able to open simple and well-behaved PDFs in Word 2013 
or 2016, so there’s no harm if you try that ﬁrst. If that doesn’t work, try copying 
the data from the PDF and pasting it into the text editor (such as Notepad++), and 
then from the text editor into Excel. en you can try an additional application, 
such as the free tool Tabula, to extract the data into CSV or XLS ﬁles. None of the 
solutions will be entirely satisfactory, but the cost of editing the table should be 
lower than manual data entry.
“Can It Export to Excel?”
Internal business intelligence (BI) systems should allow you full control over the 
content you want to extract and how you want to extract it. Unfortunately, that’s 
not always the case. Let me paint a grim and somewhat exaggerated picture here. 
First, you have to solve a communications problem. You, the business user, and 
the IT people apparently don’t speak the same language: ey don’t understand 
why a market share above 100 percent is not possible, and you don’t understand 
that they must have a rule for each of your beloved exceptions. So when you get 
the data from IT, crosscheck it to make sure you’ve got the right data.
Second, there is a political problem. e data you want and the way you want it 
may not ﬁt into the current formal corporate policies regarding access privileges, 
data security, or data dissemination. You can also be caught in a power struggle 
between IT and other areas, and they may start dragging their feet to avoid grant-
ing you access to the data.
Finally, there may be technical issues. e eternal question “Can it export to Excel?” 
forced BI vendors to make this option available. Aer so many years, I think they 
still hate it, judging from the output ﬁles I have to deal with. If the application 
can export data to CSV or Excel, there’s hardly a reason to create unfriendly table 
structures that force the user to take additional steps to clean the data. is means

extra work for you, but if in every update the format is wrong but consistent, you 
might use a macro to correct it and solve the problem.
Cleansing Data
I’ll assume that you survived the previous stage of the ETL process and you’re 
now the proud owner of a nice-looking table. But the smile will vanish from your 
face if you now ﬁnd a record of a 123-year-old new mom living in a city called 
Cincinai, TX.
e second stage of ETL, transformation, deals with data manipulation, but the 
ﬁrst transformation, data cleansing, is so important and speciﬁc that it deserves 
to be promoted to its own step. Data cleansing suggests, of course, that the data 
is dirty. Data is dirty because it contains typos or inconsistencies or fails in some 
way to meet a standard.
All this “dirt” must be cleansed before any serious analysis can take place, and 
again a pivot table can be very handy for this purpose. If you count every cat-
egory in a ﬁeld, you’d soon ﬁnd only one reference to Cincinai, TX, while there 
are many references to Cincinnati, OH. So, you’ll probably need to change that 
record because the city name is misspelled and associated with the wrong state. 
And what about the 123-year old new mom? Check the age range. She’s probably 
only 23. Please note the word “probably”; just because a value seems strange, 
that doesn’t mean it’s not real. Be sure to cross-check against a lookup table and 
against other ﬁelds for logical inconsistencies, and don’t forget to have a log that 
includes all your edits.
Transforming Data
One of the beneﬁts of making data cleansing an autonomous step is that now 
transformation can focus on adapting the dataset to the goals of the analysis. If 
you’re using a spreadsheet, you’re now moving from the cell level to the column 
level where you add, remove, or change variables. Here are a few examples of 
possible data transformations:
www.ebook3000.com

I
Encoding: If a column includes answers to an open question (where 
there are no predeﬁned answers), you must add one or more columns to 
categorize those answers. For example, if you asked people to name three 
of their preferred movie actors, you’d have to parse the answer and code 
every one of the names.
 
I
Aggregation: e level of detail may be excessive for the purposes of analysis, 
and we’ll need to aggregate the data at a higher level. Our 23-year-old new 
mom can belong to a larger category (for example, ages 20–24), or data at 
the daily level can hide a paern that can only be spoed at the week level.
I
Derived data: If we’re studying obesity and have weight and height data, 
we can calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and add it as a new variable.
 
I
Removal: Changes in project scope may make some of the observations 
irrelevant, or some variables may only be needed to calculate derived data 
(like BMI above). Keep in the dataset only the data you need.
 
I
Standardization: If we need to link our new table to other tables in our 
system, some standardization may be needed, including changes in table 
structure and in labeling (for example, M/F instead of Male/Female).
Loading the Data Table
e last stage of the ETL process occurs when the data becomes usable. is 
can take many forms, such as uploading the ﬁle to a system such as a new table, 
appending the ﬁle to an existing table such as an update, or, in Excel, simply 
changing the data format from a range to a table. In recent Excel versions, you 
can also add the ﬁle to the data model.
Data Management in Excel
It’s hard to ﬁnd a tool that, like Excel, combines power, ﬂexibility, and ease of 
use for some basic tasks when compared to other similar tools. e problem 
is that Excel training oen focuses too much on the tool and leaves out task- 
speciﬁc aspects.

Figure 4.10 A default chart when pressing F11.
For example, take chart making. Knowing how to “make charts in Excel” and 
knowing how to “make charts” are two diﬀerent creatures. Give a monkey a 
banana every time it presses F11, and you get a (very low-paid) Excel chart maker 
(Figure 4.10).
e same happens with the data. Unlike database applications, Excel does not im-
pose any kind of structure, and because users lack the right training, they believe 
that this is the natural way to manage their data. Sure, people in IT make data 
structure a top priority, but they don’t really understand business needs, do they?
Many organizations can gain much if there’s a greater mutual understanding of IT 
and user roles. Users must obtain a minimum level of literacy with data structures. 
ey must see how structuring the loose spreadsheet environment maximizes 
the power of functions and formulas that take advantage of that environment 
(pivot tables and lookup formulas, for example). is simpliﬁes chart making, 
adds interaction, and reduces updating and maintenance costs. IT personnel and 
data users may sometimes have a conﬂicting relationship, but a greater proximity 
and understanding may help them all realize that users are not always a danger 
to system security, and IT is not always unaware of business needs.

Organizing the Workbook
e number of worksheets in an Excel ﬁle is virtually unlimited, and, surprisingly, 
we can use all we want without incurring extra costs. Hence, an Excel ﬁle that 
has some level of complexity must be organized in a way that clearly separates 
the results (charts, tables), intermediate calculations, parameters, and data tables 
in diﬀerent, specialized sheets.
Links Outside of Excel
An IT-managed BI system in an Excel-centric organization risks becoming a dual 
BI system in which users get the data from the formal system, but all the actual 
analysis is done in Excel. is can quickly get out of control, with isolated ﬁle 
archipelagos in each computer, and impossible-to-reconcile data.
You can’t eradicate Excel as a BI tool unless you uninstall it. e organization 
should have a beer understanding of why users keep using Excel. If the formal 
BI model can’t address those needs, it should provide direct access to data in a 
safe and controlled manner, which again requires a closer relationship between 
users and IT.
e ideal scenario is to create one or more tables that closely match the user’s 
needs, connected to her workbook and from where she can refresh data.
Formulas
When one of the papers that shaped recent economic policy worldwide⁴ draws 
conclusions based on faulty Excel formulas, and when news of millions of dollars 
being lost due to spreadsheet errors is common, the least we can do is to assume 
that a formula is a potential threat. With all other things equal, using fewer 
formulas makes a spreadsheet simpler to maintain, improves performance, and 
produces fewer errors.
Calculations with a database query are faster and errors are oen easier to spot 
(you get to the needle-in-a-haystack frustration level much faster in Excel than 
when using database queries). You can connect your workbook to a query in 
an external database that performs all the calculations before feeding the data 
into the spreadsheet. And there are many other ways to avoid formulas, such as 
4 Reinhart, Carmen M. and Kenneth S. Rogoﬀ. “Growth in a Time of Debt.” American Economic Review: 
Papers and Proceedings, Vol. 100, No. 2: 573-578,  2010.

DATA AT WORK
94
using pivot tables instead of aggregate formulas or using a data model instead 
of lookups. Array formulas and calculations in tables are also safer and faster. 
Finally, named ranges are your friends; use them extensively.
So, as a mantra, you should think, “Avoid Excel formulas.” is seems to contradict 
the very nature of the application, but when you avoid formulas, your workbook 
becomes safer and more solid. Note that the point is not to turn your workbook 
into a formula-free zone (that’s almost impossible) but to think about beer alter-
natives. Also, you should infer from the techniques suggested above that “avoid 
formulas” doesn’t equal “hardcode data” (entering a value instead of a formula). 
Cycles of Production and Analysis
ere is a major diﬀerence between business visualization and media infographics.⁵ 
Unlike most infographics, which aren’t updated aer they’re published, business 
visualizations usually include a set of representations that remain useful from 
cycle to cycle and cut across the organization. Charts on market share and growth 
are updated for each cycle. ey are seen at various levels of regional detail and 
are common to the multiple markets in which the organization operates.
ink of business charts as the three Rs of ecology:
 
I
ey should be reused across multiple markets.
 
I
ey should be recycled by updating the data.
 
I
eir number should be reduced, making business visualization more cost-
eﬀective at multiple levels. 
is does not cover all the data visualization needs in an organization, and you may 
use many charts only once, but try to evaluate whether a chart has the potential 
to be used more than once. If the answer is “yes,” you should evaluate whether 
it makes sense to spend extra resources to prepare it for repurposing (by adding 
interaction or creating a database query, for example).
is is just a small part of the many things that relates to data management in 
Excel. If it were possible to synthesize this management in a single word, that 
word would be “structure.” Recent Excel versions have introduced new features 
that suggest more investment in the data structure (including tables, data models, 
Power Pivot, slicers, PowerBI, and so on). is, in turn, allows you to manage a 
growing volume of data  more eﬀectively.

Takeaways
 
I
Data preparation is possibly the least thankful part of any data visualiza-
tion process because it is slow, invisible, and undervalued. If you don’t have 
access to a properly formaed table, assume that you’ll spend much more 
time than anticipated preparing it.
 
I
Pivot tables can help you structure your data tables.
 
I
Although you can paste a few numbers to make a quick chart, the data source 
for more permanent charts should reside outside of Excel, and preferably 
be connected to a database query.
 
I
Bring data into Excel as close as possible to its ﬁnal format to avoid manipu-
lating data inside Excel.
 
I
Assume that formulas are a thread to data integrity, and avoid them  
whenever possible.
 
I
Structure your workbook so that each sheet has a single purpose.

DATA VISUALIZATION
In Chapter 2, we imagined buying a data visualization book at a 
bookstore. But where was it shelved? Under Statistics? Graphic 
Design? Management Methods? Or Journalism, perhaps?
In theory, we could ﬁnd a data visualization book on any of those 
shelves, and only the details of the actual book could help us choose 
the right shelf. However, you might have a preferred view of 
visualization that says a lot about your perspective. If you think 
visualization is simply graphic design with data, or even data art, 
you’ll disagree with someone else who believes visualization is 
nothing more than visual statistics. If you think eye-candy is needed 
to aract aention, this will be contrary to someone who believes 
aention comes naturally only when reason guides both data display 
and design options.
www.ebook3000.com

5 I DATA VISUALIZATION
97
Data visualization cuts across various ﬁelds of knowledge and aracts practitio-
ners from varied backgrounds, who pursue diﬀerent goals, use multiple tools, 
have diﬀerent sensibilities and styles, and push their own practices and agenda 
as the standard way of working with data. Data journalism, graphic design, and 
business visualization are some of the largest groups, although the laer receives 
less media exposure.
at’s why coming up with a one-size-ﬁts-all deﬁnition of data visualization is not 
an easy (or even desirable) task. A beer approach is to start from a minimalist 
concept and then add whatever characteristics make it group-speciﬁc. e core 
concept should include visualization as a tool, visualization as a transcript of 
abstract data into visual representations, and the roles of perception and context.
Data visualization is exploration and discovery, and it’s also communication. 
Many of the diﬀerences among its practitioners reside exactly in the way their 
visual representations impact their communication.
From Patterns to Points 
Figure 5.1 shows the three ways we read data points in a chart and how they 
become a type of data visualization. When there is nothing in our chart but dots 
(as in a scaer plot), our natural tendency is to group them. We already know 
that this is an eﬀect of the Gestalt laws, and we know that grouping happens even 
with a random variation. We also know that, when we devalue individual data 
points in favor of a paern (or, using a more generic term, a shape), the paern 
becomes the basic unit of information.
Shapes
Points
Outliers
Figure 5.1 Three ways to read data points. 

DATA AT WORK
98
e ability to see meaningful shapes in the data represents the highest level of 
data visualization, because it rep-
resents the highest level of data 
integration and a richer graphical 
landscape. Line charts and scaer 
plots are frequently used for this 
shape visualization.
Because of the chosen chart type and the data itself, we may not be able to reduce 
points to shapes, but we can com-
pare, rank, and evaluate them and 
get relevant insights. is is point 
visualization, the most common 
type of data visualization, which is 
oﬀered by bar charts or pie charts.
From time to time, we ﬁnd our perception unable to ﬁt some data points into a 
paern, or we ﬁnd the points too far away from what we believe to be within the 
normal range. is is outlier visualization, which can be useful in many tasks, 
such as systems or sales monitoring. ese perceptual outliers don’t have to be 
statistically signiﬁcant to aract our aention, and we should check whether 
there is a reason for their unusual variation, but statistics can help us quantify 
their outlierness and decide what to do with them. 
In theory, we should choose shape visualization over point visualization, but 
in practice, the right choice is task-dependent and data-dependent, and these 
concepts oen overlap and coexist in a single chart. For the same time-series, 
we may want to use a line chart or a bar chart. e former allows us to see the 
overall shape, while the laer is beer suited for pairwise comparisons. We may 
have a good reason to choose one chart type over another, but because the task 
is oen ill-deﬁned, we sometimes end up comparing answers and then selecting 
the question to match.
We’ll see that the distinction between shapes, points, and outliers plays a key role 
in our classiﬁcation of chart types. Meanwhile, more important than identifying 
the type of visualization is making sure that the selected display fulﬁlls its role 
in saving us from expending too many cognitive resources while allowing us to 
obtain the right insights quickly.

5 I DATA VISUALIZATION
99
It’s important to understand that, contrary to a common misconception, “quickly” 
doesn’t mean “in a split second” or even “at a glance.” Do you read a city map 
with a single glance? Or do you take a few minutes to understand the shape of the 
city, locate the landmarks, and ﬁnd the best way to the hotel? e same applies 
to a complex visualization. Even if it’s well-designed, it can take a few minutes 
to read and explore. It’s how quickly you get to the insights that counts, not 
the absolute time you spend familiarizing yourself with the lay of the chart.
Shape Visualization
Perceptually grouping data points presented in a 2D space is the ﬁrst step in the 
process of assigning meaning to a visual representation. at process continues 
when we encode the data points and add legends, titles, and other supporting 
objects.
We may realize right from the start that not all data points are made equal: Some 
are unique, others seem to be nothing more than random variation, and yet 
others are positioned so close together that we could generalize them—that is, 
replace them with fewer data points without losing relevant information while 
saving resources.
A shape is a form of generalization. If we can’t spot shapes in our data, perhaps 
we have the wrong data or we’re looking at it the wrong way. (You won’t ﬁnd 
meaningful paerns in every single dataset, but don’t assume there isn’t one 
before you try multiple perspectives.) More than anything else in visualization, 
data shapes trigger Eureka! moments. However, they can also trigger moments 
of illusory knowledge, like when we see an almost perfect, but spurious, corre-
lation between two variables and start wondering if one causes the other. Some 
examples of bad causality are funny (margarine consumption increases divorce 
rate), while others are dangerous (vaccines cause autism).
Shapes leave a distinct trace in oﬃcial statistics. An interesting place to look for 
these shapes is within the subcategories of the consumer price index (CPI), where 
they’ll appear as regularities.
e chart in Figure 5.2 compares the monthly all-items CPI of Greece to the U.S. 
e overall trend is similar and prey much overlaps for a very large period, but 
two major events in the U.S.—the 9/11 aacks and the bankruptcy of Lehman 
Brothers—are clearly seen. However, let’s focus on something else: the uncom-
mon cyclic paern in the Greek index.

months are January and July, while in Greece they are February and August. e 
chart in Figure 5.3 shows that sales discounts for clothing and footwear go much 
deeper in Greece than in the U.S., which could partly explain why the cyclic pat-
tern is visible in the overall index. I suspect that’s not the only reason, however. 
Because Greece is poorer, prices of basic items may weigh more in the Greek index 
than they do in the U.S. index. at would explain why there is so much overlap 
in both Greek indexes, while in the U.S. they look independent from each other.
Another example, also from the CPI in Greece, is in hair styling. e chart in 
Figure 5.4 shows the evolution of the consumer price index in the category 
“Hairdressing salons and personal grooming establishments.” e ﬁrst paerns 
we spot on the le are those double peaks in the hairdressing category index 
(corresponding to festive periods in the months of December and April) until 
Greece’s entry into the eurozone. e index was well below the all-items index, 
and aer these peaks, prices returned to their normal level in the following month. 
Upon joining the euro, they no longer stand out as much—not because they did 
not exist, but because the other months rose to the level of the all-items index. 
en, aer the ﬁrst bailout, the category index decouples from the general index 
and starts declining, without the peaks of the “old days.”

e chart in Figure 5.5 shows a strong relationship between two variables: mean 
earnings and gender. In an equal-earnings scenario, all the data points would be 
located along the line between the green and the orange triangles. If a data point 
falls below that line, it means that men earn more than women. As we can see, 
women earn consistently less than men in all countries. So, in this case the story 
is not about an almost perfect correlation between two variables but rather the 
gap between a reference and reality.
is chart was inspired by another, published by the New York Times comparing 
occupations, and the results are similar. Since the point in both charts is to compare 
gaps between men and women, and not between countries or occupations, our

chart makes this more explicit by using a log scale¹ in both axes, which makes it 
easier to see where each country stands. I used diﬀerent colors for Western and 
Eastern countries. While an expected paern emerges (mean earnings are lower 
in Eastern countries), that is not what we are looking for. We shouldn’t even con-
sider it, since comparisons of absolute values are harder using log scales. Eastern 
countries do seem to perform slightly beer than Western countries regarding 
the earnings gap, however, with three of them around or above 90 percent.
e scaer plot from Chapter 2, comparing GDP and education, allows for a third 
type of shape visualization. In that case, we didn’t ﬁnd a linear relationship between 
the two variables. Instead, we found three relatively homogeneous groups: Western 
European countries (high GDP, high education), Eastern European countries (low 
GDP, high education), and Mediterranean countries (low GDP, low education).
A diﬀerent shape results from animating a chart. In many cases, animation shows 
change over time. At any given time, we can see a shape that results from a rela-
tionship between two variables, like the one in Figure 5.5. Now, suppose that the 
income gap between men and women was much deeper 50 years ago and that we 
have data for all those years. Playing the animation, we would see the data points 
moving up in most of the countries, meaning that the gap was closing. is is the 
second shape that only time can show. For a good example of this hidden shape, 
watch Hans Rosling’s 2006 TED Talk.
Point Visualization
A chart facilitates the perception of distances between data points in a series. 
When ploed along a single axis, their distances are easy to grasp. When we use 
a diﬀerent chart type, like a bar chart, sorting the data points by their quantita-
tive dimension is a necessary ﬁrst step.
Other analyses are possible, but when comparing points we tend to focus on the 
top and the boom of the range, perform pairwise comparisons, and compare 
a data point to a reference value. In Figure 5.6 we may want to check in which 
European countries it is safer to drive, at the top, and in which countries driving 
seems more dangerous, at the boom. e Nordic countries, oen grouped so 
close together statistically, are relatively spread apart from each other.
1 We use log scales in data visualization to improve chart resolution (when a large range prevents 
the details from being seen at the boom of the range) or to compare rates of change. We’ll discuss 
log scales in Chapter 8.

Note that the chart got more interesting because we were able to slip in a paern: 
Encoding basic geography in bar colors makes it clear that, in general, driving is 
safer in Western Europe than it is in Eastern Europe.
Outlier Visualization
We can use visualization to support the validation and assessment of data qual-
ity because the genesis of an outlier may be in the data collection stage or from 
incorrect data entry. In most cases, however, the outlier is a legitimate value that 
appears again in other variables. Whatever the case, an outlier should always 
be examined and explained.

e interest in an abnormal change in prices goes far beyond the economy. In 
Figure 5.7, the consumer price index in the “Utility (piped) gas service” category 
for the South Urban Area of the U.S. is clearly inﬂuenced by recurring disasters 
in that region, such as hurricanes and oil spills, which leave their ﬁngerprints 
in the form of outliers.
ere are several statistical formulas for determining outliers (see Chapter 10). 
To the brain, an outlier is just a data point that does not ﬁt in the group, like the 
three spikes in Figure 5.7. It lies outside of the shape where most data points reside. 
If included, the outlier would create an overly complex shape. In a cost–beneﬁt 
analysis, it seems more advantageous to disregard the outlier. On the other hand, 
its positional salience gets it more aention than any other point.
In Figure 5.7, prices remained ﬂat for the last decade of the 20th century and 
steadily increased in the ﬁrst decade of the 21th century. Understanding this could 
be useful, but we barely notice it because the spikes get most of our aention.

Data Visualization Tasks
Many tasks in our daily routine can be supported by some kind of visual data 
analysis, and they are closely related to the questions we ask the data, as we’ll see 
in the next chapter. At their core, these tasks have one of the visualization types:
 
I
Searching for paerns and trends in univariate or multivariate data analysis.
 
I
Searching for relationships in bivariate or multivariate data analysis.
 
I
Ordering and ranking data points.
 
I
Monitoring variation to detect data points that lie outside a ﬂuctuation 
band or that show some other kind of strange behavior.
In a new project, it’s natural to start with a simple descriptive analysis, comparing 
points and ranking them for each variable. Eventually, we’ll start spoing paerns, 
either when analyzing single variables or when analyzing relationships among 
multiple variables. With this new knowledge, we create a monitoring system 
that draws our aention to any signiﬁcant variations. is is just an example of 
how to articulate these tasks. In practice, the nature of the project may require 
a diﬀerent sequence.
The Construction of Knowledge
Knowledge is a construction based on establishing relationships between facts and 
their interpretations. You can derive knowledge from everyday life (encoded in 
aphorisms and popular sayings), the supernatural and the religious (cosmogonies, 
for example), or from the scientiﬁc method. While aphorisms and religion tend 
to be closed systems with lile room for change, the scientiﬁc method assumes 
that knowledge is a never-ending cumulative process that is always subject to 
revisions. Each of these constructions has their validation and evaluation criteria 
and their guardians (the old man, the priest, the scientist).
Establishing a relationship between two facts creates a new and more complex 
entity, which can be combined with other complex entities, thus repeating the 
cycle. is sequence has an implicit knowledge hierarchy, where each step adds 
a new level of complexity. is is known as the DIKW Pyramid: Data are com-
bined to create Information, which results in Knowledge, integrated by Wisdom. 
A visualization pyramid wouldn’t be much diﬀerent, starting also with the data 
and ending with complex paerns that equate to knowledge.
www.ebook3000.com

5 I DATA VISUALIZATION
107
We can also ﬁnd this hierarchy in the types of answers a chart should be able to 
provide, according to Jacques Bertin: elementary, intermediate, and global. At 
the elementary level, the chart answers questions like “How much did we sell in 
March?” or “In which month did we have the most sales?” At this level, the chart 
is functionally equivalent to a table, and most charts can answer these questions. 
e intermediate level focuses on a subset of the data and answers questions 
like “What happened with the monthly sales of product X in 2015?” In the third 
level, a chart should be able to provide global answers such as “Are we gaining 
market share?” but also let the reader ﬁnd answers to the elementary and inter-
mediate questions.
Now let’s look at the DIKW Pyramid sequence in more detail.
Data
A data point is a simple observation: the population density in region x, the 
number of births per year in country y, the interest rate on day z, and so on. One 
of the mantras of journalism is “Facts are sacred.” But they are also useless. ey 
are sacred because they’re basic building blocks for the construction of knowl-
edge, and they cannot be manipulated, changed, or deleted just because they do 
not conform to the theory or our worldview. But without context, the data are 
useless, because by themselves they are incomplete. Data are like the pieces of a 
disassembled jigsaw puzzle (Figure 5.8).
Figure 5.8  
Data: a jigsaw 
puzzle in disarray.

DATA AT WORK
108
Information
We move up to the information level when we  
establish relationships between facts. is  
creates a new whole that, as the Gestalt  
laws teach us, is more than the sum of its  
parts. By juxtaposition, association, and  
comparison, we start ﬁnding paerns that  
were previously hidden in the scaered data.  
Our jigsaw puzzle begins to take shape (Figure 5.9).  
We have several sets of assembled parts, but the connection  
between them and their position in the jigsaw puzzle as a  
whole is not yet clear. Previously, we had an unconnected  
set of data. Now, we have unconnected sets of information.
Knowledge
When we realize the place of each set of information in a context that generates 
a more complex object, we create knowledge. is is endless by nature, not only 
because there is potential for creating higher-level objects but also because (un-
like jigsaw puzzles) it’s always possible to ﬁnd new ways of combining objects 
that take us to alternative paths (Figure 5.10).

Wisdom
Advancement in the knowledge hierarchy is not done by abstract entities; it’s 
made by human beings with their memories, experiences, and personalities 
in a given context. But if the ﬁrst three levels of the DIKW Pyramid belong to 
the realm of the scientiﬁc method—an approach based on observation and the 
accumulation of more complex paerns—wisdom is more of a “cultural melting 
pot” of a qualitative nature.
Wisdom is deﬁned by the understanding of interactions and an integrated view, 
enabling action, and understanding the mechanisms and indirect results of the 
action beyond the ﬁeld of study (Figure 5.11). When, in his acceptance speech 
of the Nobel Prize in Literature, José Saramago said that “e wisest man I ever 
knew…could not read or write,” it is this understanding that he refers to, which 
is not necessarily associated with knowledge of complex scientiﬁc objects.

Deﬁning Data Visualization
We can combine the idea of the brain as a stimuli manager constantly searching 
for the “good form” and disliking ambiguity with the task types we saw earlier. 
is helps us deﬁne data visualization as a tool that, by applying perceptual 
mechanisms to the visual representation of abstract quantitative data, facili-
tates the search for relevant shapes, order, or exceptions.
We can ﬁt a statistical study or the work of a data artist in this deliberately mini-
mal deﬁnition. Some deﬁnitions are more restrictive, such as the one professed 
by Stephen Few, where the goals of informing and aiding understanding belong 
to the core concept of data visualization:
ere are as many deﬁnitions of data visualization as there are deﬁners, but at the root 
of this term that has been around for many years is the goal that data be visualized in a 
way that leads to understanding. Whatever else it does, it must inform. If we accept this 
as fundamental to the deﬁnition of data visualization, we can judge the merits of any 
example above all else on how clearly, thoroughly, and accurately it enlightens.
at’s the spirit of this book, of course, but it is not the only possibility. We must 
think of data visualization as a generic ﬁeld where several (combinations of) 
perspectives, processes, technologies, and objectives (not forgeing the subjective 
component of personal style) can coexist. In this sense, data art, infographics, 
and business visualization are branches of data visualization. 
We can’t deﬁne a set of strict criteria that may be applied to all types of visualiza-
tion. at would be like trying to establish the same rules for a novel, a poem, or 
an essay. A visualization can be published in a media outlet or in a scientiﬁc paper 
and have diﬀerent communication goals. It can be static or interactive; it can 
be used for analysis and discovery or for communication. e authors can have 
contradictory views on the role of design. Just because we don’t agree on the path 
or on the goal, that doesn’t mean that one visualization is valid and another is not.
is book deals almost exclusively with visualizing data in an organizational 
environment, which makes it easier to come up with a consistent narrative on 
what data visualization is all about. is also helps avoid combining multiple 
narratives, like assuming that a cool infographic we saw in the newspaper is the 
right visualization template to apply to the data in our organization.

Each player in data visualization has the responsibility of adding his personal 
complement to the basic deﬁnition. In business visualization, this diﬀerentiation 
is the emphasis on the functional characteristics. Everything is subordinated 
to drawing recognizable and relevant objects in the graphical landscape that 
communicate eﬀectively, and inform and support the decision-making process 
in the organization. e desire to create a memorable chart through design is 
common and acceptable in other visualization perspectives but is less urgent in 
an organization.
Languages, Stories, 
and Landscapes
Data visualization is a language. Jacques Bertin makes this clear in the title of his 
book: Semiology of Graphics. Another author, Leland Wilkinson, sought to translate 
into concrete rules this semiology, writing another important visualization book, 
e Grammar of Graphics. 
If data visualization is to replace or complement other forms of communication, 
it must have qualities other than some overlap with formal linguistics. ese 
qualities are related to the creation of a uniﬁed message, based on a sequence (a 
visual narrative) or on the exploration of a graphical landscape.
Data journalism is one of the strongest trends in journalism² today. Adding charts 
or other visuals to a news piece isn’t new, but now visualizations are moving from 
a supporting role to center stage, and changing their nature along the way. ey’re 
becoming interactive and more open to alternative discovery paths. 
Data stories are a subset of the much broader concept (or buzzword) of storytelling. 
Marketers are jumping onto this bandwagon, so we should be careful how we 
create our own data stories and how we buy theirs.. Stories, or narratives, are 
useful in data visualization because they force us to recognize the limited value 
of a single chart in a complex environment. Stories also force us to recognize 
the need for a beer integration of our displays, as we move away from strings 
of siloed charts.

Stories with Data.” IEEE Transactions in Visualization and Computer Graphics, Vol. 16, No. 2: 1139-1148,

Today, narratives are oen designed to be consumed from the small screens of 
smartphones, one tiny and digestible piece of information aer the next.³ is 
is ﬁne for news consumption, but it becomes an issue if overly used in business 
visualization. Business visualization needs the time integration that a narrative 
provides, but it will be much more eﬀective if it lets the user check a large amount 
of information at a glance. at means a space integration that only graphical 
landscapes can provide. And it means larger screens.
A few years ago, I spent a weekend with my kids listening to traditional storytellers. 
Oen, they ended their story with the words “Now you know.” Now you know 
why the poor girl became a princess. Now you know how the hunters caught the 
wolf. Now you know how the boy ended up in the witch’s cauldron. And guess 
what? We did know! So now it’s time to put your own storyteller hat on and try 
this: As a preﬁx to your chart title, add “Now you know why/how/where/who…” 
If the complete sentence makes sense, then you have a good chart title (and you can 
remove the temporary preﬁx). en make sure the chart itself fulﬁlls that promise.
Graphical Literacy
Graphical literacy, or graphicacy, is the ability to read and understand a docu-
ment where the message is expressed visually, such as with charts, maps, or 
network diagrams.
When both the individual and the organizational level of graphical literacy are 
low, the organization might use many pie charts, pseudo-3D eﬀects, and Excel 
defaults, with no one thinking this is a problem. Over time, that level of graphical 
literacy might rise only modestly, and likely due only to improved Excel skills. 
But I’m an optimist, and I like to imagine that a few well-placed epiphanies will 
turn this linear trend into an s-shaped curve. Here are three of them that will 
shape the learning curve:
 
I
Epiphany #1: e seed. is is when the learning curve starts bending up. 
It is the symbolic moment when someone becomes aware that the power of 
data visualization goes far beyond illustrating numbers or competing for 
the most spectacular canned eﬀect. is doesn’t mean people start making

great charts full of insights, however. It means people start recognizing 
the problems and are willing to learn. It’s when they start thinking, “is 
pseudo-3D bar chart looks silly.”
 
I
Epiphany #2: Relationships. Typically, a new product has an initial low 
market share but grows fast. At some point, the product has a high market 
share and slow growth. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve watched people 
trying to demonstrate this behavior with two bar charts when a scaer 
plot makes it obvious. is epiphany marks the moment when we move 
from a merely descriptive aitude to an aempt to understand how the 
data are related.
 
I
Epiphany #3: Holistic. e third epiphany is understanding visualization 
not as a mere set of siloed charts prepared in a more or less coherent suc-
cession, but as a construction in which the individual chart is diluted in a 
web of relationships with other objects and other charts.
Graphical Landscapes
Don’t think of the holistic epiphany as some kind of ethereal, incense-burning, 
new-agey aesthetic. It just means that if we want to communicate visually, we 
ﬁrst must be in control of the message (how we send it, that is, not how it’s re-
ceived). is editorial dimension that we talked about can be exercised from the 
choice of data to legend placement. But the editorial dimension must go beyond 
the single chart and be able to integrate multiple charts and other visual objects 
into a coherent message, like paragraphs of a complex story. Let’s look at some 
of these “wholes.”
Proﬁling
Proﬁling is the display of multiple identically formaed and juxtaposed small 
charts, each displaying some entity’s proﬁle. A signiﬁcant part of the knowledge 
gained from reading these charts comes from the observation of the whole rather 
than from the individual charts. is is why we should consider this construc-
tion a single chart. Because the charts are placed in a grid, they represent a more 
structured level of a graphic landscape. In the next chapter I suggest a new chart 
classiﬁcation, where proﬁling appears as one of the categories.

In Figure 5.12, proﬁling is used to compare how fertility rates changed between 
2002 and 2012 in six age groups, creating a proﬁle for several European countries.
Dashboards
According to Stephen Few, “[a] dashboard is a visual display of the most important 
information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged 
on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.”⁴

Unlike proﬁling charts, dashboards don’t need to have a visual structure imposed 
at the outset, which substantially increases the freedom of their construction. 
However, they do have constraints: Because they’re used for monitoring, their 
design tends to emphasize the goal of calling aention to outliers and other ab-
normal variations from the reference point.
I made the example in Figure 5.13 for my course on Excel dashboards. e aim 
of the course is mainly to explore some Excel techniques for managing the data 
and adding some level of interaction (such as the choice of region, country, and 
year). In this case, I deliberately aempted to hide Excel. I sacriﬁced more eﬀec-
tive design options in favor of a presentation with more aesthetic appeal, without 
breaking the boundaries of common sense.

Infographics
Visually, the infographic is the loosest form of a graphic landscape. It is also the 
most confusing concept in visualization, as it’s open to multiple deﬁnitions and 
interpretations. Asked about what makes a “cool” infographic, Alberto Cairo 
replies that:

 [T]o be truly ‘cool’, an infographic needs to be honest, truthful, deep, and elegant. It can 
be fun, too, but it needs ﬁrst to respect the intelligence of its potential readers, and be 
designed not just to entertain them, but to enlighten them. A bunch of out-of-context 
numbers or grossly simplistic charts surrounded by pictograms or illustrations is never 
a ‘cool’ infographic.
ere is a very good reason for the last sentence in Cairo’s answer. Ever since 
people found that infographics have a positive impact in web page ranks (mak-
ing them appear higher in search engine results), marketing departments began 
producing infographics. But in most cases, these “infographics” are nothing more 
than junk visuals, using false or misleading data. Google seems to be reducing 
their relevance in recent updates of its algorithm, but they’re still popping up. 
And now these “infographics” are no longer created; they’re made with automated 
tools, generating profound indignation and justiﬁed irritation of visualization 
practitioners.
As a consumer, when reading a marketing infographic, you should always check 
for junk visuals, low data density, and dubious claims. As a data worker, you 
should recognize that an infographic is a media product that doesn’t belong to a 
business environment (because of the lack of design skills, the wrong tools, and 
information asymmetry, as we discussed previously).
If you want to know more about infographics, you can browse a well-curated 
selection at Visualoop and the site of the Maloﬁej Awards that take place in March 
every year in Pamplona, Spain.
No entry-level book on data visualization is complete without a reproduction 
of the best-known infographic ever: the march of Napoleon’s troops during the 
Russia campaign, by civil engineer Charles Joseph Minard (Figure 5.14). It shows 
the advance of Napoleon’s troops toward Moscow (in brown) and their retreat (in 
black). e line width encodes the number of troops. Also represented are rivers 
and temperatures. Napoleon’s troops were decimated by the Russians’ scorched-
earth strategy, which blocked supplies on the way to Moscow and river crossings 
during the winter when retreating.

DATA AT WORK

A Crossroad of Knowledge
Data visualization is a tool and, like any other tool, requires a mixture of knowl-
edge and skills to be used eﬀectively. We already discussed a few of these: the 
role of perception and the eye–brain system, culture and social laws, and data 
preparation and management. Let’s add a few more.
Statistics
You can’t use a box plot (see Chapter 10) without understanding what “median” 
and “quantile” mean. You can’t use a scaer plot without understanding correla-
tion. ese are but two of many examples where traditional statistics and data 
visualization are deeply intertwined, and the more you understand, the beer. 
Even basic familiarity with concepts from descriptive statistics can make your 
visual analyses more robust, and at the same time, this knowledge increases the 
number of perspectives you can have with the data.
Design
Design is present in all stages of graphic representation. As an inevitability, it’s 
tempting to consider design and artistic talent as basic necessary skills. ey are 
indeed useful when the goal is to design infographics or when we move to an 
artistic environment. But this is not so in business visualization.
e design skills we need are of a functional nature and are aimed primarily 
at translating the rules of perception, which are much less subjective than 
aesthetics. It is possible to make a chart formally correct and at the same time 
aesthetically unpleasant because of, for example, the choice of colors. But the 
functional color tasks and rules of color harmony allow us, as we’ll see, not only 
to reduce unfortunate choices but also to strengthen this component of func-
tional design.
Applications
Core competencies in data visualization are application-agnostic. e way we 
apply them is not. All soware applications have obvious functional diﬀerences, 
but they also have what Edward Tue called a “cognitive style”: the information 
ﬂow model, the default seings, the way they make some tasks easier or harder.

121
Forcing applications to do what we want is oen possible, but the cost is much 
higher than simply accepting the application’s “suggestions.” e right applica-
tion is therefore the one that imposes minimum resistance to speciﬁc tasks 
we need to accomplish.
Knowing what we want to do, knowing that it can be done with the application 
we are using, and not being able to do it because we lack the skills is a particu-
larly frustrating experience. One key skill in data visualization is, therefore, to 
make the application invisible—that is, to focus on the task and on the goals to be 
achieved and not on looking for the way to do it.
Content and Context
If you consider general principles and best practices of chart making, a data 
visualization expert may be able to create a perfect chart, and yet that “perfect” 
chart may be completely useless in the business context in which it is supposed 
to be applied. Meanwhile, a less than stellar chart may deliver the exact insights 
the organization needs. e diﬀerence, obviously, is in how well you know the 
organization and its data. Even a seemingly innocuous concept like market share 
can be challenging. Is it calculated in dollars or in units? Are there multiple deﬁ-
nitions of “market”?
You can hire a data visualization expert to improve graphic literacy in your orga-
nization. If in the ﬁrst day she can make more useful charts than the organization 
is used to, then there is something wrong with the organization’s visualization 
practices, and hiring her was a real smart move.
Data Visualization in Excel
Excel is a spreadsheet tool. Excel is not a database, and Excel is not a specialized 
data visualization application. We should point this out from time to time, because 
Excel is oen compared negatively to specialized applications, and that’s unfair.
at said, it is also necessary to remember that most business charts are made in 
Excel, making Microso the leader in business visualization. Even so, Microso 
never took advantage of this to improve the graphic literacy of its huge user base. It 
always chose another short-term path, more deﬁned by the sales department than 
by the principles and good practices increasingly accepted in data visualization.

DATA AT WORK
122
A major change in Excel’s chart engine took place in Excel 2007. Stephen Few 
pointedly said that this was an “opportunity missed”:
Microso has the opportunity to make a stand for excellence, but either lacks the courage, 
doesn’t understand what works themselves, or doesn’t care. Regardless of the reason, it’s 
the customers who will suﬀer.
And he expressed a similar level of frustration with Excel 2010. Microso decided 
to ﬁght its competition mostly through the cosmetics of visualization, with lile 
or no substance added to the soware. ings get beer with Excel 2016, however.
The Good
e greatest advantages of Excel over other tools for quantitative analysis are, 
obviously, its familiarity and ubiquity. Everyone who works with quantitative 
data in an organization knows the basics of using spreadsheets, even if they use 
open-source spreadsheet soware instead of Excel.
With Excel, you’ll experience a few annoying compatibility issues when using 
diﬀerent versions, but you’ll be able to share ﬁles both within and outside of your 
organization. Employing Excel as the Swiss Army knife for all things data makes 
life easier for everyone, from human resources (training) to IT (infrastructure 
management) to users (standard computer skills).
New users can easily understand Excel basics, while its ﬂexibility and the exis-
tence of a programming language allow advanced users to go far beyond Excel’s 
typical uses and overcome some of its major limitations.
In the Excel-dependent environment in which numerous organizations ﬁnd 
themselves, Excel is the right choice for learning data visualization because, in 
spite of its shortcomings, more than with any other tool you can focus on visualiza-
tion itself rather than the tool (assuming the presence of some basic Excel skills).
While Excel was always the informal leader in Business Intelligence, Microso is 
paying more aention to it with Excel 2016, adding more powerful tools (Power 
BI) and expanding the chart library.
The Bad
If we start using Excel as a visualization tool, we’ll soon notice that its tiny chart 
library (Figure 5.15) and many useless formaing options make it a tool beer 
suited for communication than for visual data analysis—and especially the type 
of communication that prefers stylistic eﬀects over communication eﬀectiveness.

Excel is a spreadsheet tool that includes some functionality to make a few in-
dependent charts (independent from each other, that is). Excel is beer suited 
for passive consumption than for active visual exploration. An active visual 
exploration does not entail simply making successive charts, but rather making 
dynamic charts that allow for visual ﬁltering, tabulating, and grouping of data. 
For example, pivot tables are great for data exploration, but if you want to explore 
visually through pivot charts, your options are very limited: Some charts, like 
scaer plots and all the new ones in Excel 2016, are not supported, and some of 
the functionalities available in regular charts are also missing.
Take proﬁling, the chart category proposed in the next chapter. In practice, with 
a real data visualization tool (such as Tableau, or R if you prefer a programming 
language), it’s just a maer of dragging-and-dropping or adding a few lines of 
code, and the soware will make all the charts for you. With Excel, you have to 
make a chart for each proﬁle you want to compare; and as you create each chart, 
you have to point them to the correct range.⁵
If you’re lucky and your chart is simple enough, some of the new features in 
recent versions of Excel (such as slicers) may reduce the workload. However, user 
interaction is still highly dependent on programming or formulas, which shis 
the focus from data analysis to formula construction. In other words, it shis our 
focus from the task to the tool, which we do not want.
e new chart types in Excel 2016 (treemap, sunburst, histogram, Pareto, box 
and whisker, waterfall) are welcome but greatly overdue additions. e Excel 
chart library is still surprisingly small, while the number of cosmetic options 
is unsurprisingly large. is signiﬁcantly limits the type of display available to 
most users, while advanced users who know how to overcome these limitations 
have to question whether the costs justify the beneﬁts.
The Ugly
I’d like to learn more about how Microso selects focus group participants, and 
speciﬁcally their age. Don’t get me wrong, I like the construction blocks in Figure 5.16. 
I just don’t understand how it can be, with only a few slight changes, one of the 
predeﬁned chart styles.

You may argue that, if I want a ﬂexible application, being able to make charts like 
this comes with the territory, and you would be partially right. e problem is 
not so much about ﬂexibility, it’s about defaults and suggested styles. Empirical 
studies prove what everyday practice tells us: Most people don’t change so£ware 
application defaults, and if they do, they tend to use a predeﬁned alternative.
Unlike Excel users, graphic designers believe this is a capital sin because they 
value some level of artistic uniqueness. For Excel users, though, the maer belongs 
(again) to the editorial dimension and the need to make charts more eﬀective. It’s 
OK if Excel does not apply color tones to group data, use thickness to emphasize 
a series, or diﬀerentiate between signal and noise. at’s our job. But default op-
tions are so imposing that not changing them means that the author was either 
careless or didn’t know enough about the content to make such decisions.
Beyond the Excel Chart Library
In a series of posts right aer I started blogging, I wanted to share my experi-
ence of replicating in Crystal Xcelsius (now renamed to SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards) a dashboard made in Excel. at experience was an uer disaster. 
Crystal Xcelsius didn’t allow even basic changes that I took for granted in Excel.

Micromanaging formaing options at the data point level is essential for geing 
the results you want, and in Excel you can do prey much anything. If things get 
really tough, you can even resort to programming. Most of the time, however, 
you won’t have to go that far. Here are some simple paths to follow if you want 
to go beyond the library:
 
I
ink of objects beyond their literal use. 
 
I
A dummy series is your friend.
 
I
Use combination charts.
Line charts, bar charts, or box and whiskers are some of the many chart types 
you can make using a scaer plot. Remember the bamboo chart in Chapter 3? 
at was just a scaer plot. You don’t have to write a single line of code to make 
charts like these.
Playing with the objects in Excel’s chart library is fun and we can learn a lot, not 
only about Excel but also about data visualization. When playing with a scaer 
plot, you may become aware, for example, that a line chart is nothing more than 
a special case of a scaer plot. If you want to know more about going beyond the 
library, you must read and follow Jon Peltier’s blog, as Peltier is the true Excel 
chart master.
e problem with going beyond Excel’s library is its cost–beneﬁt ratio. It’s inter-
esting to know that you can make a complex chart in Excel, but if that means that 
you must spend hours and hours formaing the chart, placing the data in special 
cells, or adding dummy data, you’ll have to make sure the results are worth it. 
Maybe it’s time for you to move on and ﬁnd a tool that beer suits your needs, 
by either following the Microso path (Power BI) or moving into a new direction 
(such as Tableau or QlikView).

The Lollipop Chart
Figure 5.17 shows an example 
of a chart type that you won’t 
ﬁnd in the Excel chart library. 
People call this a lollipop chart 
because, well, data points look 
like lollipops. Take a moment 
and try to guess how I made 
this chart.
This is actually a bubble chart. 
In a bubble chart, you can 
encode the horizontal and ver-
tical positions and also the size 
of the bubble. We only have 
one series (GDP), which deﬁnes 
the position of the bubbles 
along the horizontal axis. The 
vertical position is added with 
the help of a dummy series: a 
series that places the bubbles 
along the vertical axis at regular 
intervals, like in a bar chart.
As you remember, answers in 
surveys always have an error 
margin. For example, if you get 
a value of 35, the real value in 
the universe may vary between 
33 and 37. You visualize this interval with error bars, and Excel has an option to add 
them. In this case, since we don’t have to use error bars for their regular purpose, we 
can use them creatively, like making sticks for the lollipops.
Bubble sizes don’t change, so you might think using a scatter plot instead would be 
better. Problem is, with scatter plots you don’t have much control over labeling the 
data points, so you wouldn’t be able to identify the countries in the chart.
Finally, I split the data into two series, one with positive values and one with negative 
values. This allowed me to choose whether I wanted to place the labels to the left or 
to the right of the vertical axis.

Don’t Make Excel Charts
You don’t want your audience to think, “at’s an Excel chart” or, even worse, “Are 
we paying for Excel 2003 charts?” You want your audience to see the data, not 
the tool. A good starting point is to select a diﬀerent color palee, but Excel also 
oﬀers many other formaing options  that you can change from their default set-
tings. (For example, you can set gap width in bar charts to 100 percent or reduce the 
number of grid lines.) If you’re skeptical about how far you can go, let me ask you 
this: Do you think Excel could render a reasonable copy of an 18th century chart?
Few among the data visualization experts would disagree that William Playfair’s 
e Commercial and Political Atlas, published in 1786, marks the beginning of 
the modern era of data visualization. Playfair created several of the chart types we 
use today. A well-known chart from his book displays the trade balance between 
England, on the one side, and Denmark and Norway, on the other (Figure 5.18). 
Note how well-annotated the chart is, with direct labeling instead of adding a 
legend, and ﬁll colors encoding the positive or negative trade balance. is makes 
the chart very easy to read, and a good example even today.

Here is a more complex example. Several years aer his Atlas, in 1822, Playfair 
published one of his most famous charts, comparing “weekly wages of a good 
mechanic” to “price of a quarter of wheat” (Figure 5.19). At the top, he ploed 
the monarchy reigns to add some context. Today it’s unacceptable to compare 
two variables using a double vertical axis,⁶ and we would get beer insights with 
a diﬀerent chart or a diﬀerent metric, but trying to ﬁnd a relationship between 
two variables and adding context is still, almost 200 years later, a novel idea.
Now is the moment when I should ask you to turn the page and check how 
Excel would handle these charts. e truth is, I have been counting on you not 
to scrutinize them too closely. If you do, you’ll soon discover that these are not 
reproductions of the original images, but rather charts that I made from scratch 
in Excel. Yes, these are Excel charts. Not bad at hiding their nature, are they? To 
be honest, when I started making them I was convinced that they would always 
look like Excel charts, but, as you can see, they don’t.
6 We’ll discuss dual-axis charts in Chapter 14.

Takeaways
 
I
You’ll use data visualization to ﬁnd, manage, and communicate shapes, 
order, and exceptions in the data.
 
I
Business visualization favors a functional approach to data visualization 
where our main goal is to understand the data, and our weapon of choice 
is designing for eﬀectiveness.
 
I
Data integration leads us to information and knowledge. Adding data, 
ﬁnding relationships, using more sophisticated charts, going beyond siloed 
charts and designing graphical landscapes, or creating a visual narrative 
will help us climb the knowledge ladder.
 
I
Excel can fulﬁll much of the data visualization needs in an organizational 
context because you can go beyond its library of pre-deﬁned chart types.
 
I
Being able to make a complex chart in Excel can be interesting as a proof 
of a concept but may not be the best resource allocation strategy. At some 
point you may need to change to a more eﬃcient tool. If you need a full 
data exploration environment, you need to look elsewhere.
 
I
When making charts in Excel, replace the default palee and change other 
default options to avoid the “Excel chart” look.
 
I
Select a chart that you like and try to render it in Excel.

DATA DISCOVERY, 
ANALYSIS, AND 
COMMUNICATION
In the 1980s, change really started to accelerate, so that by the early 
21st century, the simple and easy-to-understand bipolar world of the 
Cold War had been replaced by a foggy multipolar world of newspeak 
and ﬂuid military and political alliances. Other well-deﬁned polarities 
started to crack too. Technology blurred the divide between producers 
and consumers, TV networks and their audience, and mainframes 
and dumb terminals. Our world has become increasingly complex.

6 I DATA DISCOVERY, ANALYSIS, AND COMMUNICATION
133
More complexity implies more variation, and more variation implies the need for 
more data, as any sampling methods handbook will tell you. However, at some 
point just adding more data will not be enough. We’ll need beer data, beer tools, 
and beer processes. Knowledge will be built, not only from reading someone 
else’s report, but also from interacting with data using the right tools—blurring 
the divide between data exploration and data communication.
We saw how relevant, yet overlooked, data preparation is. We are at the point 
now where we need to get the data ready, not just to start making charts one 
aer another but to start the second stage of the data visualization process: Aer 
thinking about the data, it’s time to think with the data.
Where to Start?
e more knowledgeable you are about the data, the more linear the visualization 
process tends to be. If you have in your hands a new data table you know nothing 
about, the sequence will be much less linear, and oen you’ll be forced to return 
to earlier stages to ask new questions, search for new data, or change priorities.
is, of course, is rooted in the unpredictable nature of discovery. Subjecting data 
discovery to a structured process can make it happen (by eliminating dead ends) 
or prevent it from happening (by overly focusing on known paths).
In practice, data exploration is oen an unruly process, and it should be, to some 
extent. Earlier, we saw how our brain becomes really good at processing routine 
tasks while becoming less able to respond to unexpected changes. Including some 
unstructured exploration in our analysis and looking at the data from unusual 
perspectives will oen lead us nowhere, but doing so quite possibly could result 
in ﬁndings that would go unnoticed otherwise.
Between an overly structured process, where we seek only those data relation-
ships that have already been found in the past and a chaotic and unproductive 
approach that has us walking in circles, we must ﬁnd methodologies that allow 
us to uncover new insights without forcing the data to tell what is not there.

The Visual Information-Seeking Mantra
According to the population census of 2010, about 20 percent of the U.S. popula-
tion is less than 15 years old, and 13 percent are more than 64 years old. ese 
are facts, nothing more. To make them meaningful, we must compare them to 
something else. Compared to most European countries, the U.S. population is 
young; therefore, making a comparison to other places is a possible path. e U.S. 
population is also geing older, with all those baby boomers entering retirement 
age; comparing the present to the past is a second possible path.
Let’s follow the path of comparing places, but only within the U.S. e top le 
scaer plot in Figure 6.1 displays the percentages of both age groups at the county 
level. e vertical and horizontal lines mark the national averages for both series. 
Half of the counties in each series are within the range deﬁned by the red lines. 
All the counties within the rectangle deﬁned by the black horizontal and vertical 
reference lines have a higher percentage of adult population (15–64 years old).
ere are a few things worth noting in this chart. We now know what kind of 
variation we should expect for the older age group and the younger age group, 
and where they’re more concentrated. Because the ranges in both axes are the 
same, we can see that variation in the older population is higher. Also, we can 
infer that larger counties tend to have fewer elderly (65+ years old) than smaller 
counties, because there are more counties above the national average, while the 
national average of the younger population appears closer to the center. 
e problem with data visualization when compared to, say, a data table is that we 
keep craving more. Questions keep popping up: Do all states have similar proﬁles? 
How about those counties with a much higher percentage of adult population—do 
they have anything more in common? Some questions can be answered simply 
by highlighting the counties belonging to each state. Let’s do this for Florida (top 
right chart). It’s clear that the population in Florida is older, both because it has 
a higher percentage of elderly people and a lower percentage of young people.
Again, new questions emerge: Does the group of counties at the boom of the 
distribution share other characteristics, such as geographic proximity? What is 
happening with that outlier county at the top le with such a high percentage of 
elderly? I was so curious that I visited the county website and the single human 
face I saw on that site was of a young girl, probably the only child in the county 
(just kidding, of course).

e population in some of these counties is larger than the population of many 
countries, while other counties have only a few families and everyone knows 
each other. We already suspect that some of the larger counties have a younger 
age structure than the national average, but this portrait can be misleading. 
Let’s focus on the darker area to improve resolution. e bubble charts conﬁrm 
our suspicion: Some very large counties are close to the national average for the 
younger group but are below average for the older group. ere is also a lot of 
dust (very small counties). is raises new questions again. Apparently, there is 
a strong concentration in a few counties. Can we measure that?
Yes, we can. e boom chart shows that half of the U.S. population lives in only 
5 percent of the counties, while 80 percent of the population lives in 20 percent 
of the counties. It can’t get more Pareto than that (we’ll get to the Pareto principle, 
also known as the 80/20 rule, in Chapter 10).
And we could go on and on. Without noticing, we moved our focus from age 
structures to county sizes to population concentrations. Data visualization can 
get slippery at times. Speaking of slippery, Alaska has the lowest percentage of 
elderly, while Washington, D.C., has the highest percentage of adult population, 
but we’d need to check that using small multiples (we’ll get back to small multiples 
in Chapter 13).
You’ll see what I’ve done here. I started by evaluating distribution shapes, and 
then I ﬁltered the data using a variable (state) that could lead to more insights. 
Finally, I focused on speciﬁc details.
is scenario, in which we start from a bird’s-eye view and progressively ﬁlter out 
and zoom in on details, ﬁts what Ben Shneiderman calls the Visual Information-
Seeking Mantra¹:
Overview ﬁrst, zoom and ﬁlter, then details on demand.
Don’t overlook the overview. Even if it seems too generic, it’s essential to estab-
lish an anchor point (which, as we shall see later in the book, can also have an 
emotional character) that structures the following analysis. It’s not just a point 
where you start drilling down. For example, a national sales manager may want 
to know how much sales incentives are being paid and then ﬁlter by region or 
product, while a regional sales manager may want to start by checking how much 
is being paid to each member of her team.

Focus plus Context
Although we should have a clear path that structures our analysis (when we want 
it to be structured), that doesn’t mean that we need multiple charts or an interac-
tive chart. Oen, a single chart is all we need. Figure 6.2 shows how much ahead 
of most other European countries the Nordic countries are when comparing share 
of energy from renewable sources. Albeit oversimpliﬁed, this is an example of 
focus plus context, in which a clear distinction is made between an entity that 
gets the focus of our aention and the remaining entities that provide context. 
Of course, a context entity may become a focus entity if we choose to switch.

e focus-plus-context approach not only nicely complements Shneiderman’s 
mantra but also solves a recurring problem: the spaghei chart. We have a reason-
able concept of “spaghei chart” (it’s useful to display ﬂows), but we oen use it 
in a derisive manner when referring to some charts (especially line charts) where 
the series are so intertwined that you can read nothing from them. If you have 
numerous series and try to color-code them all, that’s what you’ll get. Figure 6.2 
was a serious candidate for becoming a spaghei chart, but that was avoided 
thanks to the focus-plus-context approach.
Asking Questions
e most pragmatic way of beginning the data visualization process is with a ques-
tion, and then making a chart that answers that question. Sounds easy enough, 
doesn’t it? But then try asking, “Why are our sales falling?” in a meeting. Before 
geing to the answers, other people at the meeting might ask you to clarify what 
you mean by “our,” “sales,” and “falling.” 
Ask people working in market research to tell you their horror stories about 
clients who come up with their own questions. It’s terrifying, I assure you. Any 
question is subject to interpretation, whose variation should be minimized by a 
simple, clear, and accurate formulation. e way you interrogate the data is far 
more similar to the way you design a question for a survey than the way you ask a 
friend a question. at’s why I advise you to browse the section on questionnaire 
design in a good market research handbook. You’ll ﬁnd many interesting tips. Not 
everything will be relevant to data visualization, but it’ll help you understand 
charts as visual answers and it’ll help you avoid many common pitfalls.
Begin with generic questions and gradually look for more detail, as in Shneiderman’s 
mantra. Don’t worry if your initial questions seem too obvious. You can dispose 
of some of them, but you’ll need others to establish a common knowledge base 
with your audience. e data itself will suggest more questions, and comparing 
the new ones with the initial ones will be interesting (and enlightening).
e questions we ask tell a lot about us: what we know, what we don’t know, and 
even what we think we know (which may be prejudices or misconceptions). e 
questions will also ﬁrst gravitate toward descriptive, single-variable analysis 
before asking about relationships between variables, whose nature and relevancy 
is not clear at this stage.

A Classiﬁcation of Questions
Certain charts are beer suited to answer certain questions than others, but you 
should take this relationship as a broad principle. Subtle changes in the question 
and in the chart design can impact the results. Having a clear goal in mind and 
knowing what type of visualization could be more eﬀective can help us reduce 
the range of options of chart types and design choices.
When deﬁning a question, you should ﬁrst make sure it can be answered by 
quantitative analysis. You should avoid questions like “What’s the meaning of 
life?” or “Does he/she love me?” Answerable questions usually fall into one of 
these categories:
Order. Questions that emphasize comparison and sorting of 
individual points: Is my product selling more or less than the 
leading competitor?
Evolution. Questions that emphasize change over time: Is my 
product gaining market share?
Composition. Questions that assess the weight of each value in 
the whole, represented by absolute or relative values: What’s 
my current market share?
Relationship. Questions that ask for relationships between 
two or more variables: Are marketing events inﬂuencing sales?
Distribution. Questions about the location of data points 
along an axis: What’s my customer’s age proﬁle (that is, how 
are customers distributed by age)?
Proﬁling. Questions that help deﬁne a proﬁle: What are the 
characteristics of my clients in New York and California?
Exceptions. Questions that search for data points outside a 
normal range: What was the daily product defect rate in the 
last month?

DATA AT WORK
140
Order, composition, and distribution questions are typical of an early stage in the 
analysis. Evolution and, especially, relationship and proﬁling suggest a search for 
shapes in the data that already have implicit prior knowledge. In the next chapter, 
we’ll see how these categories are the basis for the classiﬁcation of charts and 
how they intersect with the type of task at hand.
One of the advantages of categorizing questions is that we become more aware of 
the multiple points of view that we can have on the data. Some of the answers to 
these questions will arouse curiosity and make you want to know more details, 
like an in-depth exploration of the market share in the age group of 25–34 years 
of our model X1 on the West Coast, for example. e average market share in the 
total population may hide signiﬁcant variations by age group or at a regional level, 
so it’s useful to deepen the analysis and detail the diﬀerences to a reference value. 
is in-depth analysis seeks meaningful variations within each of the perspectives.
If you want even more questions, imagine presenting the results and asking for 
feedback from a product manager, salesperson, or consultant. Choose real people, 
and, if possible, choose the challenging, diﬃcult-to-please type.
You can also simply add, remove, or change something in the questions: What 
happens if you add a spatial dimension (such as a continent, nation, state, or 
region)? How about adding a time dimension? What if you use other metrics and 
other ratios? How about integrating other context variables (such as macroeco-
nomic variables)?
Selecting and 
Collecting the Data
When you start analyzing the data, you’ll discover how relevant your ﬁrst ques-
tions are. You’ll discover the questions you missed and the new questions they 
force you to ask. Finding new and more complex questions is a clear sign that 
you’re learning and beer understanding reality.
Let’s return to the classical distinction between primary data (the data we collect 
speciﬁcally to answer our questions) and secondary data (the data collected for 
other purposes and which we can use, such as oﬃcial statistics). If you want to 
know what a customer thinks of your product compared to a competitor’s product, 
or how he would respond to a new oﬀer, it’s very likely that the data don’t exist. 
You need a market research study.

However, if you want to estimate the size of the market based on some demo-
graphic indicators, it’s likely that you’ll be able to get that data through an oﬃcial 
statistics oﬃce. When choosing secondary data, consider the obvious fact that the 
data was not collected with your needs in mind. Still, the primary and secondary 
data can be combined (quantifying the universe with primary data and using it 
to design a sample, for example).
e chapter on data preparation should have also prepared you for a few surprises 
you’ll encounter when you start collecting the data. Take Eurostat, the European 
statistical oﬃce that coordinates and compiles statistics from each country within 
the European Union. Aer browsing the Eurostat site for a few minutes, you’ll ﬁnd 
data collected in some countries but not in others, diﬀerences in the length of time 
series for the same variable, and several non-simultaneous breaks in time series.
All this aﬀects the way we analyze the data and communicate our ﬁndings. 
Missing data will cripple some analyses. Short time series or multiple breaks in 
series may prevent analyzing change over time, thus excluding line charts. Or the 
relationship between two variables may prove weaker than expected, changing 
the analysis and excluding scaer plots.
When using secondary data, you need to assess its quality and usefulness (again, 
a good desk research handbook can help you). Here are a few questions you 
should ask:
 
I
Is it a reliable source? 
 
I
Is there a hidden agenda behind its publication?
 
I
Can you use the concepts? For example, if you want to study “food consump-
tion,” is it OK to use the USDA’s “food availability” data instead? ey say 
it’s a good proxy to actual food consumption for which there is no data.
 
I
How was the data collected? Via phone or Internet survey? Collected by 
legal obligations?
I
Is it a sample, like in a survey, or is it data from the whole population, like 
in a census? (If it’s a sample, you must ensure that your audience realizes 
that results will ﬂuctuate within a statistical error margin.)
I
When was the data collected? Data from population censuses show heavy 
trends that are slow to change, and the main results can be used for years 
with some conﬁdence, whereas political polling during an election cam-
paign is valid for only a few days.
 
I
If the data represent a time series, are there any breaks?

Searching for Patterns
In old cartoon movies, a simple kick to the ground would trigger a gushing oil 
geyser. Real oil exploration is, of course, more complex and literally deeper. When 
we simply kick our data (that is, when we carelessly make a chart without think-
ing much about it), we may actually ﬁnd some signiﬁcant insights.
is does not mean that our deeper drilling is over—quite the contrary. What it 
really means is that if we can ﬁnd some paerns eﬀortlessly (perhaps the paerns 
we were expecting to ﬁnd), it’s likely that we’ll ﬁnd even more paerns as well 
as paerns that are more interesting. So those surface insights may be a sign of 
a deeper structure that we should investigate.
e opposite is also true. If all we get is a seemingly random variation, maybe we 
should take a closer look or change our vantage point. Reality tends to include a 
layer of randomness over a layer of regularity, where the thickness of each one 
depends on the reality itself and the way we look at it. is eﬀort to bring out 
what the data has to say is well summarized by Jacques Bertin: “It is the internal 
mobility of the image that characterizes modern charts. A chart is no longer drawn 
once and forever; it is built and rebuilt (manipulated) until all the relationships 
that are hidden in it have been observed.”² 
Or we can follow Ronald Coase and put it ironically: “If you torture the data long 
enough, it will confess to anything.”³ As long as you don’t lie or aempt to mislead, 
this is probably the one place in real life where you should inﬂict as much pain as 
possible, and then decide whether the confessions are useful and true to the data.
In a spreadsheet, the ﬁrst kick to the data may take the form of sorting and 
conditional formaing, as exempliﬁed by the graphical table in Figure 6.3. We 
can read this table top to boom and ﬁnd the usual split between Western and 
Eastern Europe. We can also read it from top le to boom right and ﬁnd that the 
tendency to improve energy intensity is clear in virtually all countries during 
more than a decade.
Exploring new data visually is like waking up in a place we do not know. Of the 
many new things that surround us, some ﬁt with ease with our expectations, but 
others require a greater eﬀort to understand, especially when they contradict 
our expectations.

Figure 6.4 A boring line chart.
Boring, right? ere is nothing very new and interesting here. Instead of absolute 
values, some well-known ratios in population studies such as dependency ratios 
may prove more useful. Let me deﬁne them ﬁrst:
 
I
Young dependency ratio. e ratio between the young population  
(0–14 years old) and the adult population (15–64 years old).

e analysis of dependency ratios is important because it tells us about the burden 
placed on the adult (working) population to support social security, health, or 
public education. e higher the ratio, the heavier the burden.
If we plot these dependency ratios, the chart becomes much more interesting 
(Figure 6.5). See the hump in the total dependency ratio to the le? It’s very similar 
to the one found in the young dependency ratio. If you guessed that this hump 
represents the baby boomers, you’re correct. And if you guessed that they’ll show 
up again 65 years later in the old dependency ratio, you’re right again.

Figure 6.5 A more interesting line chart. 
Now, you may not have noticed, but the ﬂat young dependency ratio is very in-
teresting. It is actually the key to the projection model.
To make it more obvious, let’s do something a lile diﬀerent and plot young 
dependency against old dependency, and, instead of a single variant, let’s also 
plot the low variant (lower fertility rate) and high variant (higher fertility rate).

Now, in Figure 6.6, it’s clear that aer the baby boom ended, the U.S. popula-
tion started geing older. At ﬁrst, the proportion of young relative to the adult 
population kept shrinking, while the old population remained relatively stable. 
en, suddenly the baby boomers began entering retirement age and the trend 
bent up and slightly to the le, meaning that the population is now geing old 
mainly because there are more elderly people but also because the proportion 
of young is also reducing.

In a few years’ time, these dependency ratios will probably be found between the 
low and the high variants. e low variant tells us that the proportion of young will 
keep diminishing, albeit slowly, while the proportion of elderly skyrockets. If the 
fertility rate remains stable at current levels, so will the young dependency ratio.

e old dependency ratio will keep climbing, but at a slower rate, according to the 
medium variant. e high variant shows that, in the unlikely event of Americans 
rediscovering the pleasures of parenthood, the old dependency ratio would still 
grow but at a much slower rate, while the young dependency ratio would invert 
the trend until both ratios plateau at around 35 percent.
e three charts are important. While the ﬁrst one may look too obvious and 
boring, it frames the discussion (unlike in some European countries, the U.S. 
population is still growing). When we want to go beyond this ﬁrst kick, we can 
follow a more data-centered path, such as calculating ratios (Figure 6.5), or a 
more visualization-centered path, such as using other chart types (Figure 6.6). 
Both paths are worth exploring.
Setting Priorities
e project example at the end of this chapter discusses the subject of live births 
from an unusual perspective. Perspective guides our research, deﬁnes priorities 
when retrieving and analyzing the data, and emphasizes certain aspects in the 
data while devaluing others. We should allow our perspective to ﬂoat and adapt 
to the knowledge we have acquired until a ﬁnal evaluation of priorities and 
relevance takes place.
Grouping charts according to a theme and in sequence with the message and 
puing them all on the same sheet or slide helps you ﬁnd the thread of the mes-
sage (even if the charts are separated again later).
Making multiple individual charts is like joing down unstructured thoughts on 
pieces of paper. At some point, you will start to repeat some thoughts and forget 
others. Joining these charts in sequence and trying to form a coherent sentence 
from their titles will help you focus on your priorities. Resist the temptation 
to make charts that try to respond to too many questions. Be aware also that, 
by making something interesting, you’re not actually hiding or demoting what 
is relevant.
You know that you should not use pseudo-3D eﬀects on your charts, but this doesn’t 
mean that they have to be entirely ﬂat. Not all objects on a chart have the same 
importance, and its design should reﬂect that. So how do we make charts, as Tue 
says, “to escape ﬂatland”?⁴ We already have an answer to this question: by apply-
4 Tue, Edward. Envisioning Information. Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press, 1990. I’m using the expres-
sion in a diﬀerent context. While Tue focuses on data of a multivariate nature, I’m using it to show 
how design can deﬁne multiple reading levels.

ing editorial judgment on data relevancy and by making sure the design follows 
along—taking advantage of salience in pre-aentive processing, for example.
Several charts in this book can exemplify this. Take Figure 6.2: It’s easy to detect 
a “primary” level (Sweden), a “relevant others” level (other Nordic countries), 
and an “everyone else” level (all other countries). You can apply this method to 
countries, products, or categories:
 
I
Primary. e entity I’m most interested in. It requires my permanent aention.
 
I
Signiﬁcant others. My major competitors, countries I use as a reference, 
or complementary categories.
I
Everyone else. You may consider leaving all other series visible if they don’t 
add too much overhead (forcing you to enlarge the chart, for example). 
ese series should be muted, allowing the reader to see the context without 
adding background noise.
Reporting Results
e previous stages will leave a trail of a multitude of charts, spreadsheets, and 
data ﬁles. We certainly learned a lot along the way. Now it’s time to cra a mes-
sage that is consistent, genuine, and preferably interesting for our audience.
Traditionally, some chart types, such as pie charts, are seen as more commu-
nication-oriented, while others, like scaer plots, are more suitable for data 
analysis and exploration. You’ll need to simplify and remove detail to make the 
underlying structure more apparent, but associating a certain chart type with 
communication or exploration is not helpful, unless you’re actively seeking 
to dumb down your message. is has relevant implications. 
Clariﬁcation
e ﬁrst of these implications is the further clariﬁcation of what we have learned, 
particularly as to how the various pieces ﬁt together: What are the key points 
and how do they relate to each other? What are the details that facilitate the 
understanding of the whole? What details belong in the background and what 
should be emphasized?

The Human Dimension
Clariﬁcation can also provide a human perspective of the scale we’re using. For 
example, especially aer the ﬁnancial crisis of 2008, we began to trivialize large 
sums of money without actually having any real awareness of what these values 
meant. What does 18 trillion dollars of U.S. public debt mean? It means around 
$56,000 per citizen, regardless of age. e real median household annual income 
in the U.S. was very close to that in 2014, at around $54,000. How much of that 
is my family paying?
ere are many ways of adding a human dimension to statistics, all of which 
compare some abstraction to a concrete fact people are familiar with. Data 
don’t have to be abstract just because they happen to be huge: e Dollar Street 
project, by the Gapminder Foundation, shows how income levels translate into 
the kinds of homes people live in. Hopefully, with familiarity come emotions, 
and emotions stimulate interest.

The Design
You can make dozens, even hundreds, of charts during the exploration stages. 
Many you’ll immediately delete because they don’t make sense, are irrelevant, 
or are redundant. Some will be useful to learn more about the data. You’ll add, 
remove, or split series, and play with scales. ey’re all for your personal con-
sumption, so you won’t care much about their format.
en there are the charts that you’ll actually use in your communication. Because 
things are so familiar and obvious to you now, it’s easy to overlook the need to 
make everything very explicit, from the overall message to the formaing options 
and added value of each chart. is is a dangerous moment. It’s the moment when 
you evaluate how you’ll aract your audience’s aention and how much eﬀort 
you’ll need to apply. Depending on your audience, one of these hooks should work:
 
I
WITFM (What’s In ere For Me). e data, or part of it, is about “me” 
(the audience) or about things I’m deeply interested in: my product, my 
country, my stock options.
 
I
e data have it all. ere is something so compelling about the data that 
not much eﬀort is needed. Remember the skyrocketing unemployment in 
Greece? at’s a good example.
 
I
Reason and emotion. You capture the audience’s aention with an emo-
tional hook, but your visuals remain very clean and rational. You’ll ﬁnd 
an example in Figure 14.5 in Chapter 14.
 
I
Reason is the only reason. People will naturally pay aention because 
their job or their task compels them to do so. You reward them by making 
the charts as eﬀective as possible.
 
I
Clown nose. Perhaps you don’t have much to say, but vivid colors and mov-
ing parts will make people look.
We’ll discuss design in more detail in Chapter 14.

Project: Monthly Births
In most developed countries, a larger proportion of elderly people combined with 
fewer births creates a scenario deﬁned by many as a demographic time bomb. In 
some cases, it’s already increasing social security and health costs. 
For this project, we’ll look at a tiny section of the whole issue: how the proportion 
of monthly births changed over time.
In Western societies, the number of births has fallen dramatically since the 1960s. e 
widespread access to contraceptives (the pill) has given couples more family planning 
ability and freedom to choose when they want to have children, while the role of 
women has also changed on many levels (including sexuality and the labor market).
Beyond the drop in birth rate, is this family planning capability also reﬂected in 
the monthly distribution of births during the year, which changed from a “natural” 
distribution to a planned distribution? is becomes our original question, from 
which it’s easy to derive other questions, such as whether regional paerns exist 
or whether these paerns have evolved in the same way over time.
Deﬁning the Problem
Let’s deﬁne the scope of the project, starting with the timeframe we plan to study. 
ese are long-term trends that need many years to become visible in the data. 
If we want to select a date that, more than any other, symbolizes the changes in 
sexuality in Western societies, then 1967 is the perfect starting point; it was the 
“Summer of Love,” and just a few months earlier, on April 7, the pill was on the 
cover of Time magazine.
Statistical production varies from country to country, so we shouldn’t be overly 
optimistic about obtaining data for the most recent years for all countries. With 
this in mind, 2012 seems to be a reasonable target as the ending point of our time 
series. Even if we do ﬁnd meaningful trends, they will not be synchronous across 
all countries. Forty-ﬁve years’ worth of monthly data may give us some legroom 
to spot them.
Should we include all countries, or should we impose a minimum monthly births 
threshold to reduce the risks of random variation? We should probably wait and 
see. We don’t really know the data yet, so we shouldn’t assume that variation is 
high in small countries, and we may be able to minimize it with a simple smooth-
ing technique, such as a 3-year moving average.

Collecting the Data
What’s the most eﬀective way of collecting the data? Visiting each and every 
nation’s statistical oﬃce’s website doesn’t seem the best resource allocation 
strategy. e nature of the data leads us to believe there must be international 
aggregators, so ﬁnding those should be our starting point. 
Aer some quick research, we do ﬁnd two likely candidates: the United Nations 
and Eurostat. Apparently selecting the UN is a no-brainer, since it publishes data 
for the entire world rather than only for European countries as Eurostat does. 
Comparing a few UN and Eurostat live birth values picked randomly shows that 
their values are identical, although the time series in the Eurostat is slightly longer 
(it starts earlier and has more recent data). Keep in mind this isn’t a good enough 
reason to limit our project to Europe, however, since it would be interesting to 
compare more heterogeneous realities.
Assessing Data Availability
e values may be identical, but what about missing values? Are there any? 
Instead of browsing the tables and comparing them, this is a good time to start 
visualizing the data. Not the values themselves, but rather a test to measure data 
quality. Speciﬁcally, we want to know how many months include data values, per 
country and per year. If there are fewer than 12 for any country and any year, then 
values are missing. We can accept some years with one or two missing months, 
but as a starting point, we can’t accept more than six missing values.
e table in Figure 6.8 shows the results aer combining both sources. It is a pivot 
table where we applied conditional formaing according to the rules above. Blue 
means a complete year, orange contains between one and ﬁve missing values, 
and gray contain six or more missing values. No data was reported at all for the 
remaining cases. Each row represents a country, and each column represents a 
year. e countries are ordered by the number of available months.
e table is too large to display row and column headers, but we don’t need them 
to see that the picture is not prey. It’s clear that most countries don’t have enough 
data, and we can spot gaps even in countries that collect the data in a consistent 
and sustained way. Seing a timeframe between 1967 and 2012 turns out to be 
unrealistic. Only since 1973 does this collection of data become more systematic, 
following a United Nations recommendation (I veriﬁed that aer noticing that 
several countries started to make the data available in that year).

DATA AT WORK

Assessing Data Quality
When we start analyzing the data, a new surprise awaits us: e data quality is 
lower than expected. Here are a few examples and how I dealt with them:
 
I
Inconsistent data between Eurostat and the national statistical oﬃces. 
For example, there are 12,789 births in unknown months in Italy in 2003, 
according to Eurostat. Istat, the Italian statistics oﬃce, conﬁrmed this by 
email, but the data on their own website contains no births in unknown 
months. I used the data from Istat.
 
I
Missing months. Most of the time, I used linear interpolation to ﬁll in 
missing data.⁵ I didn’t apply the same rationale in all cases. Rather, I tried 
to come up with the least bad solution in each case.
 
I
Missing years in the U.S. data. I found provisional data in the Centers 
for Disease Control (CDC) website in PDF ﬁles. I used Tabula soware for 
conversion, and it worked fairly well.
 
I
Wrongly reported data for New Zealand. Until 1990, the data for December 
are highly suspicious. I tried to correct for it, but, judging by the chart, I 
don’t think I succeeded.
I’ll spare you the details, but this example is geing more realistic than I expected. 
Perhaps a bit too realistic and too much of a cautionary tale of the many unfore-
seen issues impacting project costs and deadlines. A£er all the cleansing and 
ﬁltering processes, only 36 countries remain.
Adjusting the Data
Our goal is to evaluate whether the proportion of live births in each month changed 
over time, so we’re not using absolute values but rather percentages. By default, 
each month accounts for 8.33 percent of all births (100 percent divided by 12), 
so we need to compare the actual proportion to this reference value. e problem 
is that there are four reference values, one for each possible month length (28, 29, 
30, and 31 days), which makes analysis prey confusing. We can simplify it by 
deﬁning a standard month length and adjust the data accordingly, and that’s 
what I’ve done.

Linear interpolation allows you to estimate missing values based on neighboring values.

Exploring the Data
Since we’ve got a nice, long time series, it’s hard to ﬁght the urge to draw a line 
chart. Aer all, that’s what line charts are for, right? Figure 6.9 displays the line 
chart we get when ploing the entire time series for Sweden. ere’s clearly a 
cyclic paern, and something is changing, since the cycle is diﬀerent between 
the 1960s and the last decade. I think we need to dig a lile deeper.

Let’s try something else. In Figure 6.10, each line encodes a year. Now it’s clear 
that there are many more live births in spring than in the colder months. It’s also 
obvious that the weight of each month changes from year to year. Unfortunately, 
we can’t say that this is a random variation or a trend. ere are so many years 
that trying to ﬁnd something by color-coding them would be futile.

ese are interesting insights that can help us beer understand the data, but 
this is not exactly what we’re looking for because we aren’t paying aention to the 
problem. We are applying an autopilot solution that says we should use a line chart 
to display a time series. at’s not completely wrong, but we keep comparing a 
month with the adjacent months, while our actual goal is to check whether 
the proportion of births in each month changes over time and if that change 
is meaningful. We already know they do, but this approach is not telling us how.
Embracing Seasonality
e ﬁrst chart did reveal the cyclic paern. A cyclic paern in monthly data 
usually means that the data ﬂuctuate seasonally. What we really need to do isn’t 
to compare January to February, but rather to compare all the months of January 
over the years. is is what the original problem asks us to do, and the seasonality 
we found adds another reason to do it.

Figure 6.11 shows a fragment of the complete chart presented in Figure 6.12 for 
Sweden. I decided to copy the idea of the horizon chart and fold the y axis, dis-
playing negative values up, but in red.

Figure 6.11 A declining pattern in Sweden.
As you can see, January is mostly composed of lile red bars, meaning that the 
proportion of births in this month is a bit lower than the reference line (8.33%). 
February, on the other hand, is mostly blue and the bars are higher, which means 
that in many years there are more births in February than the reference.
March is even stronger, but now we can see something very interesting: At some 
point, March’s weight starts trending down. is is even clearer in April. Is this 
an isolated case? Maybe we should check the entire chart in Figure 6.12. I kept 
all the available data for the selected countries. erefore, the period spans from 
1961 to 2014, even though we don’t have data for the entire range in all countries.
I’ll leave it to you to study the chart, as I think it deserves a few minutes of your 
aention. Here are a few highlights:
 
I
Seasonality is real. ere are more births in spring and summer than in 
fall and winter, although in the Mediterranean countries the season starts 
and ends later.
 
I
Geography maers. Neighboring countries display a similar behavior: 
Nordic countries; Mediterranean countries; Germany, Switzerland, and 
Austria; France, the Netherlands, and Belgium.
 
I
ings are changing. ere is a clear reduction of births between Octo-
ber and January, but in March more babies are born again. However, the 
Nordic countries are having more babies in the summer months. In other 
countries, September is becoming a popular month to have them, and even 
the winter months no longer seem so negative.

is is the right chart format to answer our question. Its overall design shows 
that the problem was correctly understood, and it provides a precise and detailed 
answer. Whether we need this much detail is something that we can determine 
aerwards, but a lot of detail puts you in data exploration mode. You may want 
to stay there for a while, trying to understand whatever captures your aention. 
e chart also reinforces some doubts about data quality. ere are several outliers 
that are hard to justify, and others, such as the data for November and December 
in New Zealand, are hard to understand. And as I had been unable to determine 
why there are so many live births in January and February in the Republic of 
Korea, I had to enlarge the chart and change the scale (it remains comparable 
with the other charts, though).

Communicating Our Findings
It wouldn’t be easy to choose a diﬀerent format as compact as the one in 
Figure 6.10 to amalgamate all the data. e chart does create a rich display, full 
of detail, and encourages the reader to spend some time studying it.
However, if I were going to share it, I might need to make some changes. And, 
more important, our questions remain unanswered: Is the proportion of births 
changing globally? If so, in what direction? Aer observing the chart, we can 
safely say they are indeed changing. But are changes in one country reinforcing 
or canceling out the changes in other countries? 
e chart in Figure 6.13 summarizes the data at a higher level, answering our 
question for Europe (the group of countries for which we have more data). e 
design makes it simple to read, and the metric is just the proportions of live 
births, instead of a more complex one, such as the variation to a reference value.

e reference line makes it clear which months are above and below, and there is 
an interesting conversation between them and the trend lines. Now we can answer 
the question: We can conﬁrm that the spring months are trending down in favor 
of the summer months, while the winter months remain at the same level. We 
can use the same format to drill down, comparing the proﬁles we found, such as 
comparing the Nordic countries to the Mediterranean countries.
Takeaways
 
I
Structuring your data visualization process will make it more eﬃcient 
and will yield higher returns. However, this doesn’t mean that you should 
always follow a predeﬁned path.
 
I
Sometimes, the data themselves will force you to consider further analysis, 
but looking at known data from a diﬀerent perspective can reveal unsus-
pected insights.
 
I
e visual information-seeking mantra and focus plus context can help 
you ﬁnd a starting point and your overall approach to the data.
 
I
Translate the problem you’re trying to solve into a few questions.
 
I
e best questions deal with order, composition, distribution, evolution, 
relationships, proﬁling, and exceptions in the data.
 
I
ese questions must be very speciﬁc and clear. Find tips on how to write 
questions in a market research handbook.
 
I
Come up with questions that allow the audience to understand the broader 
context, while using other questions to add detail.
 
I
Get the data to answer these questions and be prepared to go back and let 
your curiosity work to formulate a few more questions.
 
I
When selecting data sources, make sure the data meet your multiple needs 
(Can you trust the data? Are concepts and methodologies aligned with 
your project?).
 
I
Make sure your charts are answering the real questions, not apparently 
similar ones.
 
I
Simplify to clarify. You’ll need simpliﬁcation as much as your audience will.

HOW TO CHOOSE 
A CHART
We’ve already met many of the actors of our visual theater. Now it’s 
time to introduce them more formally.
In Chapter 1, we deﬁned “chart type” as a set of standardized trans-
formations applied to the data points in the “proto-chart.” We have 
complete freedom in the way we use the data points. Line segments 
connect points to make a line chart; rectangles connect points to 
the axis to make a bar chart. Whatever the result of these changes, 
there is a diﬀerence between seeing the chart and interpreting it. e 
audience may not always be able (or have the interest) to decode a 
new chart type and may prefer a familiar one.

DATA AT WORK
164
We also saw in Chapter 1 that there can be signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the eﬀective-
ness of two charts. e eﬀectiveness of a chart type is relative and determined 
by its suitability to the speciﬁc situation: the task, the message, the audience’s 
proﬁle, the medium, and the context.
Even if we consider every single chart within the Excel chart library as a unique 
chart type (which we shouldn’t), that only scratches the surface of the myriad 
chart types available today.¹ If you’re forced to choose from a vast number of 
options without a clue as to how to group or ﬁlter them, this leads to paralysis. 
Barry Schwartz shows this in his book e Paradox of Choice.²
e best way to avoid a choice such as this is to have a clear understanding of your 
goals and how to achieve them using data visualization. If your inner wizard is not 
yet ready, you might try an application wizard, although it will never understand 
the speciﬁcs that make your project diﬀerent from every other project.
A third option (the one we’ll be discussing in this chapter) is to classify the charts 
into categories. Consider this as only a rough starting point, though, because even 
subtle design options can make a chart jump from one category to another. For 
example, when you add a variation band to a line chart, it probably means that 
you’re less interested in a trend than in spoing outliers, eﬀectively moving the 
line chart to a diﬀerent category. ere’s no unambiguous relationship between 
charts and tasks, and more generally, a particular chart type does not have a direct 
relationship with any single task.
Look again at the Excel charts library (Figure 7.1). Each category is broken down 
into some subtypes, but unfortunately the multiplicity of choices is more illusory 
than real. ere are actually fewer chart types here than you may think at ﬁrst. 
You might notice that the obnoxious cones and pyramids available in previous 
versions of Excel are nowhere to be found. It’s not that Microso came to its senses 
and removed them; it just demoted them to column options. If you look closely, 
you’ll notice that Microso could have applied the same reasoning to several of 
the other chart subtypes.
1 If you want to know how much a myriad is, Robert L. Harris’s Information Graphics: A Comprehensive 
Illustrated Reference, New York: Oxford University Press, 2000, contains more than 850 entries and 
nearly 4000 illustrations, according to Amazon. Even if it misses a few of the new chart types, it’s 
still a great starting point.

In a book intended for spreadsheet users, it’s tempting to accept this classiﬁcation 
as based on visual characteristics. You can’t deny that it is an objective classiﬁcation, 
just like grouping people by the color of their eyes. But the question is, how useful 
are these classiﬁcations? Can you infer computer skills from someone’s eye color? 
Can you infer a chart’s adequacy for a task based only on visual characteristics?
Also, if you go beyond the basics, you’ll soon ﬁnd yourself making what Excel calls 
“combo charts,” which might include bars, areas, and lines (see “Combination” 
in Figure 7.1). If most of your charts are combination charts, what’s the point of 
having this classiﬁcation in the ﬁrst place?
No maer how objective its criteria seem to be, any classiﬁcation will start to 
crack at some point. If we use more subjective criteria, such as task type, the 
ﬁrst thing we have to accept is that each of the main chart types can belong to 
more than one category. For example, a connected scaer plot can be grouped 
either with scaer plots (both display relationships) or line charts (both display 
paerns of change over time).
Even though chart classiﬁcations are not as arbitrary as constellations, they’re not 
neutral. ey induce us to think on their own terms. A classiﬁcation like the one 
in Excel, which emphasizes visual characteristics, leads us to a more decorative 
approach to data visualization. On the other hand, when we use a classiﬁcation 
based on task adequacy, it’s easier to forget about useless visual eﬀects and 
focus on the options that make the chart more eﬀective.
While the connection between chart eﬀectiveness and task type is clear, you can’t 
forget that there are other criteria inﬂuencing your choice. In this chapter, we’ll 
devote some aention to two criteria: the proﬁle of the audience and the form 
of distribution.
Task-Based Chart Classiﬁcation
I don’t think we’ll start speaking of “proportion charts” instead of “pie charts” or 
“relationship charts” instead of “scaer plots” any time soon, but ﬁnding a beer 
balance between form-based naming and function-based naming would be an 
undeniable improvement. We could start by making sure that the task type and 
chart type always appear together in the same sentence—the former justifying 
the laer.
www.ebook3000.com

7 I HOW TO CHOOSE A CHART
167
Figure 7.2 (on the following page) proposes a task-centered classiﬁcation. e 
key to grouping tasks is to consider that a task makes a question operational to 
some extent. So it makes sense that we share the same categories discussed in 
the previous chapter: order, composition, distribution, trend, relationship, pro-
ﬁling, and alerts/exceptions. ese categories can be further grouped into point 
comparison tasks and data reduction tasks as major categories, and data-driven 
annotations as a supporting category.
e ﬁrst row displays the most commonly used chart in each category. From the 
second row on, charts were selected based on their potential to answer the ques-
tion. As noted above, a chart may appear in more than one category.
People oen explore and come up with new chart types. I did so myself when I 
created the “bamboo chart” (Figure 3.8). Trying to make this list exhaustive by 
listing most chart types by category would be impossible, so the charts are included 
as a representative sample of concepts in each category. ere is a practical limit 
to the examples given: the ability to make the chart in Excel. If you can’t make it, 
or the cost does not justify it, the chart is not included. e following chapters 
are structured around this group of chart types.
is last category deserves further explanation. Check the red circles below. ey 
represent the days I ate chocolate in March.
In this case, we’re visualizing on/oﬀ states, but if I shouldn’t eat chocolate, the 
on state can be regarded as an exception. We should call this visualization an 
“outlier detection chart.” As such, it doesn’t ﬁt into the major categories of point 
comparison or data reduction tasks. At the same time, we can see outlier detec-
tion as a special case of annotation, driven by some kind of underlying data. 
When you add these data-driven annotations to a chart, they can take the shape 
of dots, variation bands, or contextual bands (such as when you have a gray band 
marking a recession period).
Let’s call these data-driven annotations a supporting category, cuing across the 
other categories but also using their own graphical devices.

Audience Proﬁle
I once had the bad idea of sharing a dra of a dashboard that included a very 
colorful bubble chart. But colors had no functional justiﬁcation in this dashboard 
and created serious overlapping issues. I removed the color ﬁll in the ﬁnal ver-
sion, to some users’ bier disappointment. It was like taking lollipops away from 
children while explaining how bad they are for their teeth.
I also had someone trying to convince me of the superior accuracy of a pseudo-3D 
pie chart (I kid you not!). It’s tempting to aribute this to a bad case of illiteracy, 
but I think that’s an overly simplistic explanation for an organization that’s 
accustomed to a consistent ﬂow of data visualization production and consumption. 
In both of these examples, we must also factor in emotions, impression manage-
ment, and even classiﬁcations that emphasize aesthetics over eﬀectiveness.
e great graphics team at the New York Times is not afraid to experiment with 
new ways of communicating visually. is is at odds with their scaer plot avoid-
ance of just a few years ago for fear that their readers would be unable to make 
sense of them.
is example of the New York Times is also relevant from the point of view of 
information asymmetry, as discussed in Chapter 3. It is acceptable to assume 
that charts for consumption within an organization can deliver a more complex 
message because the audience shares a common knowledge base. With the media, 
however, information asymmetry is harder to deal with. e message needs to take 
into account a more complex context that includes factors beyond information, 
such as graphic literacy, consumption circumstances, interest, and aention.
As a creator of information products, your customers want you to deliver results 
that meet their expectations. e easiest path, with the greatest probability of 
success, is to do exactly that, even if that means poorer visualizations and lower 
return on investment. Trying to go beyond customer expectations means that 
you will probably have to ﬁght for your ideas and will have a hard time explaining 
why they’re beer for the organization. is applies to basic things, like remov-
ing pseudo-3D eﬀects to improve readability and eﬀectiveness, but also to charts 
that force the audience to change the way it thinks and reasons about the data. 
In Figure 7.3, the line charts at the top represent unemployment rate and job va-
cancy rate independently. You don’t have to be an expert to sense that there must 
be some type of connection between these two rates. When you plot them one 
against the other, as is done in the boom chart, you get the so called Beveridge

While you should ﬁght established routines if you think you can improve them, 
you must have the humility to recognize that people within the organization know 
the organization and the data it needs beer than you. So this requires eﬀort on 
both sides and oen goes from the technical level to management.
For example, a manager assumes that the sales force will not understand a dash-
board and that this will create some friction in the short term, so an information 
product with a more familiar design is the beer choice. You, in turn, will try to 
show management the main advantages of using a dashboard and ﬁnd ways to 
minimize friction. You might do this, for example, by annotating profusely and 
making sure that you provide answers to all their needs.
Here’s a concrete example. A basic visualization rule is that a chart is not a table. 
When you label every single data point, all you get is a bad chart and a bad table. 
at’s why only a few data points should be labeled, such as the highest, the lowest, 
the ﬁrst, the most recent, and the one at which something happened. For many 
cases, this is the right thing to do. Also, because extensive labeling requires more 
space, that would require enlarging the chart. Some tasks, however, require access 
to precise values. Sales incentives, for example, are based on precise metrics, not 
on the answer we get from our impressions of a chart. We must ﬁnd a solution 
that satisﬁes both the added value that visualization brings to data analysis and 
the precise result that turns into actual incentives.
e bullet chart (Figure 7.4) is a beer alternative to speedometers. (We’ll discuss 
bullet charts more in the next chapter.) One of its advantages is that we can stack 
them, using very lile space, where we can both visualize the data and get the 
values from a table-like structure, satisfying both needs.

Sharing Visualizations
e distance between the charts displayed on a screen and the audience is 
usually greater than we realize. at path is ﬁlled with technical barriers and 
incompatibilities, the political management of information, and the proﬁle of 
the audience. Hence, it’s useful to assume that the audience will never see your 
graphical representations the same way that you see them on your screen, and 
this should be factored in from the beginning of your project.
Consider an interactive visualization, for example. It seems to be a wise choice for 
any audience. But is it? Take a top manager. Perhaps she has no time to explore 
the data and delegates this task to middle managers, who should provide her with 
only a static synthesis of essential ﬁndings.
Middle managers, in turn, believe that interactivity distracts sales teams or 
makes them analyze the data on sales performance in ways that are impossible 
to reconcile, destroying a shared knowledge base. So, rather than an interactive 
visualization, perhaps a standard PDF report will ensure that everyone is on the 
same page regarding the way the organization analyzes the data. In this example 
organization, interactive visualization may be relevant only to a small fraction 
of the total personnel.
Screens and Projectors
If I had to choose an object to symbolize Murphy’s law (“what can go wrong will go 
wrong”), I would choose a projector. It will mess up sizes and aspect ratios, wash 
out your carefully selected color scheme, or evilly replace things. We will never be 
fully prepared for a temperamental projector; we can only minimize its impact.
Your computer screen probably has a diﬀerent aspect ratio and higher resolution 
than a projector. If you don’t consider these diﬀerences and instead focus only 
on your visualization, the projector will make you pay at show time, cropping 
your images or making fonts too small to read from afar. Make sure that, from 
time to time, you switch your screen resolution to the projector’s resolution. 
Also, you’ll probably want to increase distances between color hues and add 
saturation (Figure 7.5). 
Figure 7.5 You may need to switch to an LCD-friendly palette (palettes from ColorBrewer).

Above all, always test your visualizations on a projector and screen before using 
them in your presentation. (By the way, this also applies to dashboards and other 
visualizations that are meant to be shared and used on other computers.)
Smartphones and Vertical Displays
According to Hannah Fairﬁeld, senior graphics editor at e New York Times, 
more than half of the newspaper’s website traﬃc comes from smartphones, 
which forced them to rethink the way 
they structure their stories. Unlike 
print or large desktop screens, where a 
large amount of data can be presented 
simultaneously for user exploration, 
small screens mean that space must be 
used wisely, beginning by editing out 
any unnecessary features. Layering and 
sequencing provide means for moving 
from one screen to the next, like reading 
one paragraph aer another. Transitions 
must be smooth and the connections 
must be obvious.
In data visualization, the vertical dis-
play is great. Not because we’re going 
to switch the typical aspect ratio of bar 
charts or line charts, but because the 
width in a vertical display is suﬃcient 
to display them (Figure 7.6), leaving 
the lower half of the screen for text 
or for a second chart. For a horizontal 
display, we would enlarge the chart to 
ﬁt the screen.
PDF Files
We discussed in Chapter 4 the senselessness of using PDF ﬁles to share tables 
and raw data, but if you want to share a static visualization almost exactly as you 
designed it, a PDF ﬁle is a great option. A PDF is much beer than, for example,

a raster image like PNG or JPEG formats. You can create large pages that read-
ers will be able to zoom in and zoom out, or you can go the smartphone way and 
create multiple small pages.
Excel Files
In a closed and standardized environment, sharing your visualization in Excel 
not only can add interaction but also can give users access to the raw data. ings 
will get a bit rougher if you factor in multiple Oﬃce versions, localization issues, 
or security seings (regarding mail aachments or allowing for running macros), 
but sharing in Excel is a serious option.
Sharing Online
If you compare the Insert menu of Excel online and Excel 2016 (Figure 7.7), you’ll 
see that a severe adjustment to your visualization may be needed if it uses several 
of the features not present in Excel Online.
Sharing full-featured interactive visualizations online that were made in Excel 
would be the best of many worlds, but it’s still a bit frustrating (and expensive, if 
you use a Microso infrastructure, including SQL Server and SharePoint). ere 
are a few nice spreadsheet controls for .NET applications that you can use, but 
they don’t fully replicate Excel functionalities, so make sure they meet your needs.
As your literacy and experience grows, you’ll become more impatient when 
using Excel as your data visualization tool. Interactive online visualizations 
such as Tableau Public or Power BI may bring about those impatient moments, 
and you may decide that you need to replace Excel with a specialized data 
visualization tool.

Takeaways
 
I
e way a chart looks maers, not as the starting point, but as the result 
of a process—the process of answering a question or completing a task. 
at’s why a task-based classiﬁcation of chart type is preferable to other 
types that are based only on their visual characteristics.
 
I
When you subordinate your chart choice to the task type, you become more 
aware of the task itself and how you can fulﬁll it eﬀectively. Keeping your 
goal in mind makes it much less likely that you’ll add useless decoration 
and visual junk.
 
I
Other criteria should also be taken into account, such as the expected au-
dience literacy. In some contexts, you may need to choose a more familiar 
chart, while in other cases using extensive annotations can be enough to 
introduce a less familiar chart.
 
I
Another criterion for selecting a chart is how it will be shared. Interactivity, 
ﬁle formats, and the hardware involved may require changes to the design 
that can range from details (such as font size) to large structural changes 
(such as using animation instead of multiple charts).

A SENSE OF ORDER
is chapter is mostly about comparing data points. Some of the tasks 
you can do when comparing data points are ordering, sorting, and 
ranking. Comparisons are found everywhere in data visualization, 
so much so that Edward Tue says that “compared with what?” is 
“the deep, fundamental question in statistical analysis.”¹ In a more 
or less explicit way, you’ll ﬁnd comparisons at the heart of every 
category in our chart classiﬁcation. If you aren’t comparing data 
points, you’re comparing trends or proﬁles.
So, in this chapter we’ll be comparing things but in a very strict sense: 
We’re working at the data point level, with points that are ordered, 
sorted, or ranked by a relevant key. ey’re not compared to the total 
(otherwise, we would be talking about composition) and we’re not 
turning them into shapes by perceptual reduction and generalization.

three examples where comparisons are not possible or relevant (Figure 8.1).

We might format a chart so badly that we can read nothing from it or, even worse, 
what we read is the opposite of what the data actually says. at’s not the case 
for the top le image in the ﬁgure. It’s clean, everything is there for a reason, 
and it can’t possibly mislead you. Now, it looks like a chart, it reads like a chart, 
it’s made like a chart, but it’s actually a duck² because it violates the most fun-
damental principle: ere is no data visualization with a single data point. Data 
visualization is like the tango, and the more data points, the merrier.
2 is is a word play with a Tuean background: “When a graphic is taken over by decorative 
forms or computer debris…then that graphic may be called a duck in honor of the duck-form store, 
‘Big Duck.’” Edward Tue. e Visual Display of Quantitative Information and Envisioning Information, 
Second Edition, Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press. 2001.

Formally, it’s acceptable to consider the top right image in Figure 8.1 as a proper 
chart. Aer all, it’s well formaed, and it contains enough data points to make 
comparisons possible. But the thing is, what’s the point? If there is no variation, 
there is no reason to make a chart.
e image at the boom of Figure 8.1 is an example of data dumped into a chart 
without any visible criteria. ere is indeed a lot of variation, but the way the 
chart is formaed turns interpretation into a mission impossible.
Of course we can come up with scenarios, rhetorical (“See? In spite of all the 
propaganda, it didn’t move an inch”) or forced by the nature of the data (missing 
data), where these charts might be used, but as a rule, a chart is relevant only 
when it displays multiple data points, when it allows for their comparison, and 
when variation is interpretable.
e most popular chart in ordering data points is the bar chart. It’s also the most 
familiar example of a chart taking advantage of “position along a common scale,” 
the most accurate of basic perceptual tasks according to the Cleveland study that 
we discussed in Chapter 2.
A chart that combines familiarity and accuracy combines two qualities that make 
a good chart, so shouldn’t we use the bar chart even more oen? Let Amanda Cox 
from the New York Times answer that: “ere’s a strand of the data viz world that 
argues that everything could be a bar chart. at’s possibly true but also possibly 
a world without joy.” 
She’s exaggerating, of course. No one will ever argue that data visualization can be 
reduced to boring bar charts only. What she means (I think) is that the emotional 
dimension and creativity can’t be removed from data visualization. You can see it 
as a trade-oﬀ, whereby you sacriﬁce some eﬀectiveness and expect more engage-
ment in return. is is a central equation in infographic design. In an ideal world, 
the joy of aesthetics and the joy of understanding (our Eureka moments) would 
go hand-in-hand, but we oen need to accept a less-than-perfect compromise.

The Bar Chart
A bar chart encodes the values of a discrete variable into the height of columns 
or the length of bars.³ In Figure 8.2, the variable “expenditure” contains 14 cat-
egories. e vertical axis (y) represents expenditure amounts in a predeﬁned 
unit of measurement (in this case, U.S. dollars). Usually, the vertical axis ranges 
between zero and a round value slightly above the maximum data point value. 
From this chart, it’s easy to conclude that Housing is the highest expenditure, 
almost double that of the second highest, Transportation.
3 To make things simpler, from now on let’s identify them as vertical bars and horizontal bars.

Vertical and Horizontal Bars
As we saw in Chapter 1, and represented here again in Figure 8.2, the data points 
for a vertical bar chart are placed along the vertical axis and then oﬀset at equally 
spaced distances along the horizontal axis to allow for beer discriminability 
and easy labeling.
I’m sure you noticed the awkward position of the labels along the horizontal axis. 
Rotating them makes it harder to read them and takes a lot of room. If you don’t 
rotate them at all, they’ll overlap. Sometimes you can solve this problem by split-
ting the labels into two or more lines, but that wouldn’t help in this case. Instead 
of rotating the labels, a beer idea is to rotate the bars, creating a horizontal bar 
chart (Figure 8.3).

It’s oen said that the diﬀerence between horizontal and vertical bar charts is the 
room available for labeling each data point. It’s not quite that simple, however, 
because there are no two identical chart types. If there is a time dimension, for 
example, it’s beer to keep the bars vertical, so that time ﬂows as usual from le to 
right. We have more ﬂexibility if we’re using nominal variables without an explicit 
order. Fortunately, charts that use nominal variables are usually the ones where 
longer labels are more common. Also, if you’re creating multiple bar charts, try 

DATA AT WORK

to be consistent and avoid randomly switching between vertical and horizontal 
bars. If you must make the change, be sure your audience understands why.
Color Coding
I’m trying not to be too dogmatic, but if I had to choose the single most useless 
formaing option in Excel, I would probably choose “Vary colors by point.” I have 
never found a good reason to use this option. Sure, you should identify every 
series in a bar chart by a unique color. at’s one of the uses of color. But randomly 
assigning a color to each bar adds empty meaning and confuses the audience.
at said, you can and should use multiple colors in a single series if (and only if) 
doing so enriches the chart. You do that by assigning meaning to each color you 
use. Figure 8.4 shows the diﬀerences between these encoding options. e chart 
on the le is the typical, one-color bar chart. I wanted to call the audience’s at-
tention to a speciﬁc data point, so I made a slight change that forces the audience 
to compare Florida to all the other states. e middle chart is more interesting. 
It adds a kind of geographic dimension, color-coding each state by the U.S. Census 
Bureau regions.⁴ Now we know that there is a geographical paern to poverty, 
because most of the poorer states are in the South. is is a good reason to add 
a map to our analysis. 
e last chart uses the Excel option “Vary colors by point.” You’ll ﬁnd that Excel 
loops in a sequence of 12 colors. Does this provide any useful insights? I don’t 
think so!
Ordering
Ordering values alphabetically makes it easy to locate a single value in a table. 
We also order people by name when we want to emphasize that no one is more 
important (tough luck if your name is Zuckerberg…hmm, or maybe not). Used 
like this, the alphabet allows us to generate a good enough random order. 
Unlike with tables, however, it’s easy to see why data visualization abhors alpha-
betical order: It destroys paerns and makes it very hard to compare data points. 
It’s like a new version of Excel’s “Vary color by point.”
4 In specialized data visualization applications, instead of a categorical variable, like region, we 
could use a continuous one, like population density, but in Excel that is almost impossible and would 
require far too much work.

Figure 8.5 displays the population density for each U.S. census division, using three 
ordering criteria. Even though there are only nine data points, three of the top 
four regions are so close that, in the le chart, you have to spend some cognitive 
resources trying to ﬁgure out which one comes second, third, and fourth. Your 
job becomes much simpler if you sort the data points by population density, as 
the chart on the right does. Now your precious cognitive resources can be applied 
to more relevant tasks.

In the boom chart, you have to think of the U.S. as a horizontal axis where the 
census divisions are approximately ordered geographically from west to east. 
We can easily conclude that the East is much more densely populated than the 
West (although excluding Alaska would make population density in the Paciﬁc 
division much higher).
Especially when there is more than one series, there is never a predeﬁned good 
way to order the data points. Each key may reveal unexpected insights, so it’s 
beer to test with several keys. Again, ordering alphabetically is usually coun-
terproductive, so don’t order alphabetically unless there seems to be a mysterious 
relationship between category names and the data, or your goal is to force your 
audience to focus on individual data points.
Chart Size
Charts are oen larger than they need to be for the message that they convey. 
A textured, pseudo-3D bar chart could take as much space as four carefully 
designed charts, or even more, if we’re prepared to lose some detail. For creating 
a graphical landscape, each chart should be as small and compact as possible, 
within the limits of viewing comfort, the audience, the context, and the type and 
level of detail to be displayed.
Due to its high level of accuracy, the bar chart allows for a signiﬁcant level of 
compression without losing the essence of its message. In Figure 8.6, the chart 
displays the percentage change of GDP for 38 countries or regions. Edward Tue 
proposed these “word-size” charts and called them “sparklines.”⁵
As this example shows, the crisis that started in 2008 aﬀected all countries on 
the list (with the red vertical stripe marking negative growth), so if that was your 
core message, these sparklines could ﬁt the bill. But the chart also shows one of 
the major weaknesses of sparklines: the diﬃcult management of vertical scales. 
e version on the le uses a common range for all the countries, which almost 
turns the bars into a sequence of dashes but allows for a beer comparison 
between countries. e one on the right uses country-speciﬁc scales, which 
improves resolution, but you will no longer be able to compare countries.

is example shows that you can make very small charts and still retain much of 
the message. It doesn’t mean you have to go that far, however. A trick you can use 
is to create a regular-sized chart and then resize it to make it smaller. If it starts 
looking cluered, change the font size or remove something that will make the 
chart look uncluered again. Repeat the process until you can no longer remove 
or change anything without inﬂuencing the message beyond an acceptable level.
Breaks in the Scale
e chart at the le in Figure 8.7 leads us to conclude that we spend much more 
money on Transportation than on Food. e right chart conﬁrms that we spend 
more on the former than on the laer, but the gap is much less pronounced than 
the ﬁrst chart leads us to believe. e data are the same in both charts, so the 
error must come from somewhere else.

e scale in the le chart doesn’t start at zero. Since, in a bar chart, we compare 
bar heights, their variation in this chart is not proportional to the variation in the 
data. As we know, cognitive tasks should complement, but not correct, perceptual 
tasks. Failure to do so, as in this case, is one of the most common techniques of 
manipulating the message in a chart.
You break the scale when you remove a section from it. In the example, the scale 
was broken at the boom, thus not starting with zero. But you can remove a 
section anywhere in the scale. Fortunately, in Excel you can do this only at the 
boom (but there are tricks to simulate other breaks).

DATA AT WORK
188
By default, you should avoid breaks in scale because they invalidate reading and 
comparing distances from the axis to the data points. In chart types where we 
don’t visually connect the axis to the data point, as in line charts, this issue is less 
relevant, but that’s not the case with bar charts.
In some cases, the scale is broken out of malice, but let’s forget about those. We 
break the scale to improve resolution—that is, to see in more detail the diﬀer-
ences between very similar data points. Take gross domestic product (GDP), for 
example. We don’t usually see charts with absolute values of GDP, because only in 
extreme circumstances are there impressive variations. A 2 percent change could 
go almost unnoticed, and that’s normal, but these small changes have tremendous 
eﬀects in the economy. at’s why we use variation instead of absolute volumes.
Changing Metrics to Avoid Breaks in the Scale
Unfortunately, seing the scale at zero is the best recipe for creating dull charts, 
in both senses of the word: boring and with lile variation. e solution is not to 
break the scale, but rather to ﬁnd a similar message that can be communicated 
using alternative metrics.
Take the absolute value of GDP in Ireland in Figure 8.8. Although it displays 
a consistent growth for over a decade, only a soul of rare sensibility will be 
impressed by the small increases from one year to the next. ey are important 
but hard to quantify, and what does a few million more or a few million less mean?
Figure 8.9 tells a diﬀerent and richer story. It represents the year-to-year varia-
tion in the same period. What we only sensed in the previous version becomes 
very clear. And, to make the chart even more explicit, a reference (variation in 
the European Union) and two annotations (the shading in the euro period and 
the reversal of the color for negative growth) were added.
is change in perspective helps us beer understand the behavior of GDP over 
the years, using a bar chart but without having to manipulate the scale.

Evolution and Change
e concept of evolution suggests some degree of stability in consecutive periods 
that creates recognizable paerns when using a line chart. Change, in turn, is 
more unstable, and a paern is harder to detect. Keep this in mind when choosing 
between bar charts and line charts. When the ups and downs are so pronounced 
that no paern or trend is detectable, use a bar chart. If there is a glimpse of a 
paern, a line chart may be a beer choice.
A Special Bar Chart: The Population Pyramid
Traditional population pyramids contain numerous confusing features. As an 
example, in the le chart of Figure 8.10, each gender is placed on one side of the 
axis. First, this prevents an accurate comparison between genders. It also shows 
that using a bar chart itself is less than useful because it makes it diﬃcult to add 
more series. And ﬁnally, since each gender is on opposite sides of the axis, color 
coding for each gender as used here holds no value.

In Figure 8.10, let’s now compare the traditional pyramid bar chart to a new chart, 
on the right, that replaces the bars with lines. e bar chart feels so busy that it’s 
almost impossible to extract any meaningful knowledge from it. e line version 
respects the need to identify the population proﬁle, with the added beneﬁt of 
allowing for a beer comparison between genders, because the axis is now folded. 
As you can see, in 2010 there are more males in the lower age groups, and only in 
the population aged 50 and older are there more females (this would be diﬃcult 
to see in the bar chart version). It’s also easy to compare the proﬁles in each year. 
All of this while taking up much less space. 
In Figure 8.11, we take this line chart concept to an extreme level, summarizing in 
a single chart the age structure of the population in the Maldives islands between 
1985 and 2050 (projected), or 66 series for each gender. Notice how the darker 
tones, corresponding to the ﬁrst years of the time series, draw a typical pyramid. 
Notice also how over time the population gets old, revealing more weight at the 
top of the pyramid and less at the boom.

I believe the chart looks beautiful while keeping a good level of eﬀectiveness, but 
my actual goal was to show that an aesthetically pleasing Excel chart is not an 
oxymoron. ere are more eﬀective ways of conveying this population change 
(such as an animation or a series of small pyramids for every 10 years, for ex-
ample), but this is the kind of balance between aesthetics and eﬀectiveness you 
should experiment with.
Well, it might be a good idea to take a break now. If possible, get a lemon sorbet 
to cleanse your palate, and close your eyes for a few seconds. en you’ll be ready 
to appreciate some soer stimuli.
Dot Plots
Aer a few pages of circumspect bar charts, a few dots hanging on wires 
(Figure 8.12) may not look like much, but actually they’re an excellent alternative 
to bars for two major reasons: cluer and break in the scale. 
Try to imagine Figure 8.4 with dots instead of bars. I can assure you it would look 
much less cluered. Visual cluer is one of the most serious issues with bar charts. 
Using a bar to represent a simple data point is clearly overkill that results in no 
room for more data. At times, this may make us overlook less obvious things. e 
population pyramids oﬀer a glaring example of this.
But dot plots are not only about reducing cluer and avoiding overstimulation. 
Because we don’t compare heights, dot plots actually allow us to break the scale 
to improve resolution, and that’s a big plus over bar charts.
Notice in Figure 8.12 that Washington, D.C., is a strong outlier when it comes to 
population density. One of the solutions to keeping chart resolution at a reason-
able level is to remove outliers and explain why you’ve done so in the form of an 
inset. In this case, the inset shows that the range between the top and the boom 
values is much smaller than between the top value (New Jersey) and the outlier 
(Washington, D.C.). Using the inset allows us to have a good resolution in the 
chart and at the same time be aware of the outlier, the much higher population 
density in Washington, D.C.
If you want to have fun and use a bar chart without the bars, try adding a tail to 
the dots (using error bars). e resulting chart was named by Andy Cotgreave 
the “lollipop chart.” I did that for Maryland in Figure 8.12, just as an example. 
Note, however, that you can’t break the scale with lollipop charts, since the 
lollipop stick is just a thin bar (see also the lollipop in Figure 5.17).

Had we used a bar chart, we would face again the problem 
of how to order the data, an even more serious problem 
now because we have two series to choose from instead 
of one. But since the best way to solve a problem is to 
prevent it, we can use this slope chart and stop worry-
ing about it.
e slope chart is already familiar to us: We saw it in the 
ﬁrst chapter as an alternative to pie charts, Figure 1.17, 
and now we use it again as an alternative to bar charts. 
In Figure 1.17, we were comparing two dates, while here 
we’re comparing two categories, or more speciﬁcally, 
lowest to highest quintiles. is shows that a slope chart 
is not just a short line chart, and that the lines shouldn’t 
be seen as indicating a trend. e slope chart’s purpose 
is to represent variation between two states, which 
you can deﬁne by two dates but also by any other pair 
of categories. Traditionally, there is the notion that we 
shouldn’t draw lines between categories, because there 
are no intermediate states between them (for example, 
a chart displaying data for male and female would read 
“the more male…,” which wouldn’t make sense). is 
rule is now more ﬂexible, and you can use lines to show 
diﬀerences, not only in change over time, but in many 
more contexts.
Strip Plots
e strip plot (or one-dimensional scaer plot) has 
been with us since the beginning of this book; this may 
lead you to suspect some form of favoritism, which is 
not far from reality. Strip plots are the basis of all one-
dimensional charts, including bar charts and dot plots. 
ey diﬀer from bar charts and dot plots because points 
are not oﬀset along the opposite axis.
e strip plot in Figure 8.14 is the one-dimensional 
version of the ﬁrst chart in this chapter, on average 
annual expenditure.

Strip plots are naturally ordered, so that’s something that we don’t have to worry 
about. ey also take a lot less room than the equivalent bar chart, although label-
ing is not so easy. I believe strip plots will become more popular once we get rid of 
this need to identify every single data point (interaction can provide identiﬁcation 
on-demand, allowing us to focus on more interesting data points or clusters).
Speedometers
Driving a car may seem like a great metaphor for managing an organization, but 
you risk a nasty accident if you take the metaphor too far. And you’re taking it 
too far if you’re using speedometers and other ill-suited charts in an executive 
dashboard. As you can see from a simple Google search for “executive dashboard,” 
things can really go overboard (Figure 8.15).

A car dashboard shows you all you need to know about the car now, in the simplest 
possible way, so that you don’t have to take your eyes oﬀ the road for more than a 
split second. Focus on driving and forget the data. Sooner or later a red light will 
tell you that you need to refuel.
Data at non-alert levels are more relevant for a manager than for a driver. is is 
truer when you factor in a time dimension: Your current speed is not explained 
by the past, whereas it is important to check how your market share changed 
over time. When using the car dashboard metaphor, designers oen neglect this 
time dimension, probably because the 
corresponding object in the car dashboard 
is missing.
Speedometers usually have a much glossier 
look than the simple one in Figure 8.16, 
but they share the same nature: a needle 
encoding a data value and a red–yellow–
green scale to help read it. is makes them 
champions of low data density.
Bullet Charts
If you need a visual representation of a key performance indicator (KPI), how 
do you design it so that it communicates eﬀectively and reduces the amount of 
required real estate? Stephen Few suggested something he called the “bullet chart,”
which is basically a strip plot where we plot actual values and target values, while 
reference values are represented as shades of gray and are embedded in the axis.
e bullet chart in Figure 8.17 is the result of my own interpretation and trans-
lation of Few’s speciﬁcations to Excel. In several examples, Few combines the 
bullet chart with an alert, so it seems appropriate to make those a single object.

If one can get beyond shiny things, it’s easy to see why bullet charts are much 
beer than speedometers: ey are much more compact while displaying two 
data points instead of one (a 100 percent improvement!). Also, when it makes 
sense to compare KPIs you can stack bullet charts, making comparisons much 
easier than the equivalent speedometer design (Figure 8.18).
Figure 8.18 Stacked bullet charts.
Download the

Bullet charts and speedometers do share the issue of indicator polarity, whereby 
in some cases more is beer (such as GDP growth) and in other cases more is 
worse (such as unemployment rate). When comparing multiple indicators, they 
should share the same polarity. If that’s not possible, there must be visual clues 
to make the audience aware of the inversion.
Alerts
It may seem strange to include a point in a chart 
classiﬁcation. In fact, the point is not a chart, but 
its role is crucial for visual monitoring tasks, 
and we can argue that the point represents a 
comparison to a normal state.
Look again at Figure 8.18. It displays ﬁve bullet 
charts, but only one is asking for closer aention 
because an immediate action may be required. 
An alert is not a summary. ere are always val-
ues within an acceptable ﬂuctuation range that 
shouldn’t be associated with them. 
Figure 8.19 shows some types of alerts available 
in Excel as conditional formaing. Oen, the 
yellow alarms correspond to “all cases that are 
not green or red,” which makes no sense. Alert 
design should ensure that they trigger salience 
in pre-aentive processing, which is lost if we 
color code all data points.
Figure 8.19 You can use 
conditional formatting to 
display alerts in Excel.

Keep in mind that people managers usually agree in making alerts more excep-
tional, but at the same time suggest that positive (green) alerts should also be in 
place to counter the negative impact of red alerts. Compromise, if you need to, 
but don’t forget that alerts are rare, by deﬁnition.
Takeaways
 
I
When comparing data points, most charts force you to choose an ordering 
key. Always choose a key that is aligned with your task. Since alphabetical 
order is virtually random, you should never use it.
 
I
Bar charts are perceptually very accurate. Take advantage of this and try 
making them much smaller than usual.
 
I
Don’t break the scale in bar charts. If you have high absolute values that 
don’t change much, switch metrics and display the relative change.
 
I
Slope charts, strip plots, and dot plots are less sensitive to the chosen 
ordering key or to breaks in the scale, making them the right choice when 
these issues arise.
 
I
Use bullet charts when you want to show one or more KPIs, especially if 
you want to display multiple thresholds (such as target, below, and above).
 
I
Use alerts sparingly and only when the data requires them. Don’t use yellow 
alerts or other colors to signal intermediate states.

PARTS OF A WHOLE: 
COMPOSITION CHARTS
As all parents know, no two slices of cake are exactly the same. In 
the eyes of children, their piece is always smaller than the others’ 
pieces, which triggers the inevitable cry of “It’s not fair!” Evaluating 
the actual size of the slice is one of our ﬁrst failed experiments in 
our assessment of proportions, something that will never change. 
Just like our irresistible fascination with all things circular.¹

ere is another reason that explains our everlasting love for proportions. Some 
charts, such as scaer plots, are very abstract, while others resemble real objects 
with which we interact on a daily basis, thus requiring a minimal learning curve. 
We tend to favor the laer. Few people know what a sectogram is, but they are famil-
iar with its objectiﬁcation in the form of a pizza, a cheese wheel (such as the French 
Camembert), or pseudo-3D pies. A sectogram is just a pie chart with a boring name.
When thinking about composition, the goal is to understand how the whole is 
constituted, and how much each segment contributes to the whole. Let’s deﬁne 
composition as a generic term referring to any whole, expressed in absolute or 
relative terms, while proportion is a subset that refers to charts in which the total 
is expressed in relative quantities and the slices add up to 100 percent. e most 
common chart for representing composition is the stacked bar chart, while cir-
cular charts like the pie chart are the most popular for representing proportions 
(Figure 9.1). e pie chart is also the most popular chart in general, if we measure 
popularity by the number of results in a Google search.

Composition charts (especially pie charts) are controversial like no other—loved 
by many (the charts are fun and our customers really love them!) and despised 
both by others and by experts (they are wrong on so many levels!). As we dis-
cussed earlier, reducing the usage of pie charts and other composition charts to 
a minimum is indeed a kind of rite of passage in data visualization. at’s why 
a chapter on composition charts in a data visualization book is essentially an 
exercise in damage control.
What Is Composition?
e “whole,” expressed in absolute or relative terms, is central to any composition 
chart. No maer what, the whole must be displayed in each and every composi-
tion chart. Again, no maer what. And there is no mystery or complex notion of 
meaningful whole: it is the exhaustive and exclusive (meaning no overlapping 
parts) sum of all its parts.
Let me show you how damaging hiding the whole can be. In the stacked bar 
chart on the le of Figure 9.2, it appears that around 90 percent of the exports 
of manufactured industrial products are medium-to-high tech, which is great...
until you actually read the labels in the vertical axis and realize that the chart 
is deceiving you: It’s truncated at the top and at the boom, which is something 
a responsible chart maker should never do, for reality is much less bright aer 
ﬁxing the scale and showing the whole. In the chart on the right of Figure 9.2, 
instead of 90 percent, medium-to-high technology accounts for a lile more than 
60 percent of the exports in this country.
Composition or Comparison?
Let’s approach composition from a ridiculously strict (albeit true) perspective. If 
a composition chart represents parts of a whole, then the whole is the reference 
to which each value must be compared. For example, a pie chart can tell me that 
my market share is, say, 25 percent. I can then check my competitor’s market 
share, but I can’t compare both (I told you this is ridiculously strict). A composi-
tion chart must be read in sequence, as illustrated in Figure 9.3. e moment I 
start comparing both market shares, I move away from a composition task to a 
comparison task, without even realizing it.

9 I PARTS OF A WHOLE: COMPOSITION CHARTS
203
Let’s add just one more argument in this extreme approach to composition charts. 
Unless a slice falls into what Simkin and Hastie² call “anchor points” (easy-to-spot, 
perceptually salient angles, such as 0º, 90º, or 180º) (Figure 9.4), you’ll always get 
a less-than-optimal perception of the actual slice size, even more so if the slice 
doesn’t begin at one of those well-deﬁned angles. So, only in very speciﬁc and 
simple cases can composition charts actually be useful and relatively accurate.
Remember how hard it was to determine which of two non-aligned bars was 
higher in the section on Weber’s law in Chapter 2? at was a theoretical example, 
but later in this chapter you’ll see how the use of composition charts can hide 
useful insights that become obvious when you realize you’re comparing things 
and switch to a more eﬀective chart type for that task.

Chart selection ultimately boils down to two things: what the task is really 
about, and the trade-oﬀs you’re willing to accept.
Composition is a comparison with a framework (the whole). Rationally, however, 
you almost never need the framework. You may argue that people like to see it, 
and you would be right. e problem is that there is a price to pay in eﬀectiveness 
and the accurate assessment of the data points. You must decide whether you’re 
willing to pay that price to get your audience’s aention.
In his scathing article “Save the Pies for Dessert,”³ Stephen Few does concede 
that pies are beer than other charts when you want to compare grouped values, 
although he believes there is no signiﬁcant real-world usage to make this a rel-
evant feature. As an example, Figure 9.1 clearly shows that Food and Housing 
account for almost 50 percent of total expenses, something that is much harder to 
see using bar charts (in a bar chart you’ll have to read the axis ﬁrst and perform 
mental calculations). See the section on donut charts later in this chapter for a 
more complex example.

Pie Charts
A pie chart is a circular chart in which each value is encoded by a proportional 
slice that can be read using its area, angle, or arc (Figure 9.5). As seen in Chapter 1, 
we can take the pie chart as a variation of a stacked bar chart. e pie chart is 
one of the charts furthest away from the proto-chart, measured by its number of 
transformations. In addition to this, the pie chart is oen subjected to decorative 
transformations to make it more similar to an actual physical object (Figure 9.6).

Critique
Pies are an easy target. Edward Tue says that they shouldn’t be used, because they 
lack a real axis, before adding that a “worse design than a pie chart is several of 
them.”⁴ Stephen Few doesn’t use pies and advises his readers against using them,⁵ 
suggesting that they should be le to dessert.⁶ Few’s criticisms are mostly related 
to the diﬃculty of comparing slices and the objectiﬁcation through pseudo-3D 
eﬀects and glossy textures.

My position is closer to Ian Spence’s,⁷ who stresses that criticism comes from 
people who ask too much of the “humble pie.” e pie chart is just an “aractive 
device for the display of a small number of proportions.” Perhaps this is the ulti-
mate criticism: not taking the pie chart seriously, seeing it as nothing more than 
a design device to add some fun, the Comic Sans of data visualization. In theory, 
I do not exclude them, because I believe that in certain circumstances they are 
useful, but in practice I always ﬁnd a beer alternative.
We can view the pie chart as a sign of low graphical literacy. When Albert Einstein 
said that “everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler,” he 
could hardly ﬁnd a beer example than pie charts to demonstrate oversimpliﬁca-
tion. When an organization uses too many pie charts, either it doesn’t take data 
visualization seriously or it downplays the complexity of the issues it has to tackle.
Damage Control
e pie chart at the le in Figure 9.7 is an example of using a we-are-trying-to-
fool-you asterisk in data visualization, and is based on a real-world example of a 
city budget. If you sum the slices, they will not add up to the total value displayed. 
e mystery of the missing slice is solved aer reading the note. e result is as 
misleading as the stacked bar chart from Figure 9.2: You can’t say you have a budget of 
301 million euros and then make a pie chart showing only the interesting expenses.

and Behavioral Statistics. 30-4: 353–368, 2005.

e right pie replicates the le one but adds the missing slice. All other slices 
are now smaller to accommodate for the new one. Strangely, this doesn’t seem 
to maer; it’s too much work to check all the slices, one by one, and compare 
sizes in both pies. e fact that adding such a signiﬁcant slice is met with such 
perceptual indiﬀerence speaks volumes about how insensitive to variation we 
are when using a pie chart. 
If your organization has developed a bad pie chart addiction, the ﬁrst step is to help 
it recognize that it has a problem, because that’s the moment inertia is broken and 
interesting things start to happen. Meanwhile, you’ll need to implement a damage 
control policy. You can start with this checklist and then add your own items:
 
I
For any composition chart, the whole must be obvious and meaningful. 
If some slices are missing and others don’t seem to belong to the concept, 
the audience may suspect a strong tendency for cherry-picking values.
 
I
Does it make sense to sum the categories? Don’t use a pie chart to represent 
time series.
I
Can the metric be summed? Pie charts can’t represent averages or growth 
rates.
 
I
Are percentages in the data consistent with the proportion in the chart? 
Verify that they add up to 100 percent. Rounding justiﬁes 100.1 percent or 
99.9 percent and can be tolerated. Everything else is wrong.
 
I
I don’t know how one would include negative proportions in a pie chart, 
but even if you ﬁnd a way, don’t do it.
I
Make sure you group values visually (using similar colors) when they have 
something in common.
 
I
Sort the values in descending order within each group.
 
I
Do not use special eﬀects or pseudo-3D or exploded slices. Use color con-
trast for emphasis.
I
Do not use a legend. A pie chart allows for direct labeling. If the labels 
overlap, perhaps you are displaying too many slices.
You should be aware that there are no direct alternatives for representing propor-
tions, because the most eﬀective alternatives actually represent something else. 
e question is whether we want to observe proportions or to compare values 
that happen to be expressed in percentages.

The Fan Chart
I was playing with this idea of making reading pie charts more accurate, such that they 
would provide the ability to compare to the whole and to compare slices, while retain-
ing their “pie-ness.” I came up with what I call the “fan chart.” I must tell you upfront 
that I still tag these charts as “fun” and “pie.” In other words, they lie at the bottom of 
the usefulness scale. But these chart types show that we can play with Excel and try 
to ﬁnd a way to solve a speciﬁc issue.
In Figure 9.8, pie charts display the age structure by broad age groups for the U.S. and 
Brazil. Then, below each pie chart, I added a fan chart. (You’ll see in the next ﬁgure 
why I called them “fan charts”). In a fan chart, all slices start at zero degrees (verti-
cal) and they are not stacked. Notice how the U.S. and Brazil have almost exactly the 
same proportion of adult population, at around two thirds? The big diﬀerence is in 
the proportion of children (much more in Brazil) and elderly (much more in the U.S.). 
It’s much easier to compare the proportions of children and elderly in the U.S. using 
the fan chart, isn’t it?
In Figure 9.9, each chart represents the proportion of an age group for all countries in 
each continent. The charts reveal very diﬀerent demographic proﬁles (compare Europe 
with Africa, for example), while a sub-continental analysis for Asia is needed. It would 
be useful to add interactivity to explore the data, or at least adjust the length of each

line to the absolute value of the population, allowing the diﬀerentiation of China from 
a small island in the Paciﬁc. This chart allows this, thereby introducing a second metric, 
which is not common in proportion charts.
Every new chart type should be met by a healthy amount of both enthusiasm and 
skepticism. Perhaps a new chart oﬀers a solution to a visualization problem you were 
previously unable to solve, or perhaps it forces you to look at the data from a diﬀerent 
perspective. Or a new chart type may provide an answer to a question that no one asked. 
If the new question is asked, does the new chart answer the question more eﬀectively 
than other chart types? Above all, does the chart respect the data?

Donut Charts
While the pie chart aracts strong criticism, the donut chart is almost ignored. 
Why? Because it’s seen as a minor chart, and every bad thing you say about pie 
charts can be applied to donut charts, and then some: e absence of a visible 
center makes it even more diﬃcult to compare slices.
Donuts appear to have the advantage over pie charts of allowing for the compari-
son of multiple series, one in each ring, which makes them the circular version 
of stacked bar charts. In fact, though, there is lile value in this, for it only helps 
to compare the ﬁrst and last values of each series, just like the stacked bar chart.
Figure 9.10 shows how a donut is typically used for comparing two or more inde-
pendent series, one in each ring. Let me ask you this: Do people spend more time 
in leisure and sports activities (which really means watching TV, for the most 
part) when they spend fewer hours working? e correct answer is “yes,” but 
you have to spend some (too much) time comparing the segments in each ring to 
come up with the answer. e same happens with most of the other categories.

Donuts as Multi-Level Pies
Although its close relationship to the pie chart isn’t the best calling card for donut 
charts, they’re not totally useless. ey’re great at improving upon the only thing 
pie charts are good at: aggregating slices. It goes without saying that you must 
get rid of the hole ﬁrst, turning the donut into a multi-level pie chart.
e donut chart in Figure 9.12 shows the expenditure breakdown in the U.S. us-
ing a three-level hierarchical structure. You can see both how each major item 
contributes to the whole and how each sub-item contributes to the parent item. 
To take advantage of a chart like this, you need to add interaction to identify 
each item or sub-item on demand, since you can’t possibly label every single one 
(in Excel, you can identify segments when hovering the cursor over each item).
is example shows that, while a donut chart shouldn’t be used to compare inde-
pendent series, it can help when there is a hierarchical relationship between them.
is raises again the issue of the editorial dimension when making charts. It’s 
oen advised (rightfully) to minimize the number of slices in a proportion chart to

from two to six. is chart contains 76 categories—far, far beyond that acceptable 
range. But because it’s structured in a way that allows us to switch between levels, 
we can safely move from a simplistic deﬁnition about absolute limits to a loose 
interpretation that takes into account the way the data is organized and displayed.

ese are nice additions to the Excel chart library, especially the treemap. Unlike 
in other Excel charts, the way you order the data doesn’t really maer, because 
each level is algorithmically sorted. You do need to be careful how you structure 
your data table; Excel must know exactly which labels correspond to which values 
so that there are no aggregate values. Figure 9.15 shows the table structure for 
the item Food. You can use the same structure for both chart types.

Probably because they’re new implementations, the sunburst chart and treemap 
don’t feel like real Excel charts right now (early in 2016). e level of control we 
usually have over the details is nowhere near what we can ﬁnd in the other charts. 
e treemap is actually very basic and is nothing more than a rectangular version 
of the sunburst chart. For example, a treemap usually encodes two variables: one 
for rectangle size and one for rectangle ﬁll color. A popular encoding combina-
tion is volume and growth, where growth is encoded by a color ramp. is is an 
important feature that is missing in the treemap’s initial implementation, in 
Excel 2016. And being able to remove the hole in the sunburst chart would be a 
nice improvement, too!

Stacked Bar Chart
e stacked bar chart in Figure 9.16 belongs to a report by the European 
Commission. is chart has many issues, including the inverted order of proﬁ-
ciency level, the intrusive comment in the middle of the chart, the color palee, 
and missing data. In addition to these problems, this chart demonstrates how 
diﬃcult it is to read and compare intermediate bars in a stacked bar chart—not 
only in this chart but in all composition charts with more than two categories.
is example makes it even more obvious that in most cases we are not interested 
in comparing a data point to the whole but rather in comparing multiple data 
points with each other. So the right chart for this data table is the one that allows 
for beer comparisons between proﬁciency levels and also within each level, like 
the one in Figure 9.17.
is panel chart,⁸ in addition to not requiring color coding for level identiﬁcation, 
shows variations that can be detected only if the series are aligned. Using color, 
as we have done previously to highlight the countries of Eastern Europe, we can 
see that they generally have higher values in levels 2 and 3 and lower levels in 4/5.
8 We’ll discuss panel chart and similar chart types in Chapter 13.

Pareto Chart
Since in most cases a composition task is in reality a comparison task, and repre-
senting the whole is irrelevant, the bar chart is oen the suggested alternative to 
proportion charts. But one issue remains to be solved: how to show the cumula-
tive values. e Pareto chart can reconcile this need with the need to compare 
categories eﬀectively.

e Pareto principle, from which the Pareto chart gets its name, postulates that 
for many events, 80 percent of the eﬀects are the result of 20 percent of the causes 
(the 80/20 rule). e Pareto chart lets you compare the relative weight of each 
category as well as their cumulative eﬀect, showing the individual values of each 
category in vertical bars arranged in descending order, while a line displays the 
cumulative value.
e bars in the top chart in Figure 9.18 (on the following page) would give us a 
very clear idea of the diﬀerence in population size between the major EU countries 
and the rest. However, the cumulative line makes it even more obvious: ere 
are 28 countries in the EU, but more than half of the population is concentrated 
in only four countries (Germany, France, the UK, and Italy), and nine countries 
compose 80 percent of the population.
e version of the Pareto chart at the top displays two unsynchronized axes: the 
le axis for individual absolute values and the right axis for cumulative percent-
ages. Using two axes should ordinarily be avoided, but in the case of the Pareto 
chart, the reading of the variables is clearly independent and there is no risk of 
the reader drawing conclusions based on their relationships. Still, it’s useful to 
make sure that the reader uses the correct axis to read each series. You can do 
this using the same color encoding.
e chart at the boom uses two synchronized axes. ey represent exactly the 
same quantities at each grid line, although one represents absolute values and 
the other represents relative values. e problem with this approach is that it 
degrades resolution: e clear split between countries in the top chart is missing 
in this. When you have many categories, you can end up with a ﬂat chart where 
you can’t discriminate each one, so testing both options is a good idea.
Some authors in quality control suggest that the way Excel users design Pareto 
charts is not entirely correct: In the ﬁrst bar, the line should run from the bot-
tom le corner to the top right corner, and not in the center of the bar. I’d like to 
know more about this and other apparently debatable rules, but as an exercise, 
I followed them in the boom version. I used a scaer plot, because it’s easier 
to implement the chart with this than ﬁguring out how to do it with a bar/line 
combination chart.

Takeaways
 
I
e distinctive characteristic of composition or proportion charts is the 
representation of the whole, deﬁned by the cumulative values of all cat-
egories. e most common examples of composition charts are stacked bar 
charts, pie charts, and donut charts.
 
I
Composition should be seen as a minor task in data visualization. From 
an extreme point of view, we can argue that all we can do when using 
composition is compare a single data point to the whole. 
 
I
In almost all cases, especially when dealing with relative values, composi-
tion analysis is in reality a comparison analysis, where the whole is of lile 
importance.
 
I
Intermediate categories are diﬃcult to compare using pie charts or stacked 
bar charts.
 
I
Although there are scenarios in which a pie chart is simple and familiar 
enough to give the audience a general idea of the values and their relative 
proportions, the frequent use of pie charts should be taken as a symptom 
of low numeracy and graphicacy within the organization.
 
I
Overall, the best alternative to pie charts is the Pareto chart, which allows 
for a more eﬀective comparison of individual data points and also gives a 
sense of the whole through the display of cumulative values.

SCATTERED DATA
Henry Ford once remarked that “Half of my advertising budget is 
wasted, but I don’t know which half.” Similarly, we could say that 
half of our data are noise, but we don’t know which half. ere is 
always signal (useful information) and noise (irrelevant variation) 
in a data set. Not only can we not always tell which is which, but 
signal and noise also change from task to task and from user to user.
In our pursuit of simpliﬁcation and the good form, it would be ideal 
if we could reduce an entire data distribution to a single indicator 
like the mean, with an acceptable level of information loss. We can
ﬁnd such variables, but they’ll lack relevant variation and they’ll 
ultimately be useless.

However, we may be luckier than Henry Ford. All distributions have a shape 
(or form), and once we know that shape we can start trimming the noise while 
keeping the shape intact, for the most part. 
A traditional way of learning the properties of a distribution is through the ex-
tensive use of descriptive statistics, but if you think you can always trust statistics 
to help you discover a distribution’s shape, think again. Let me show you what I 
mean with a famous example that the data visualization community loves.
e four data sets used to create the charts in Figure 10.1 are identical. Or at 
least that’s what you would have concluded had I concealed the charts from you 
and shared only some of the most common statistical measures of each data set, 
such as mean, variance, correlation, and linear regression. ese measures are 
identical for all four charts. And yet a simple glance at the charts is enough to 
conﬁrm that the values in each data set are far from identical.

Figure 10.1 Anscombe’s quartet illustrates the need for a complementary relationship 
between statistical measures and data visualization.

DATA AT WORK
224
ese four scaer plots are called the Anscombe’s quartet, from its author’s 
name, the British statistician Francis Anscombe. He wanted to show (successfully) 
that data sets with identical statistical properties may correspond to very diﬀer-
ent distributions.
Anscombe’s quartet demonstrates one of the reasons why we need to visualize 
the data: not to replace, or even minimize, the role of traditional statistical 
methods but to be aware of their complementary relationship, where both perspec-
tives are important and where only the nature of the task allows us to decide the 
best combination.
is complementary relationship takes many forms. When you have all points 
of a distribution ploed on a chart, you get a very detailed picture—much more 
detailed than anything you can get through statistical measures, naturally. But 
there are two issues with this. First, you may get lost in all the detail and become 
unable to “see the big picture,” with all the noise canceling out the signal. Second, 
you’ll want a quantitative value that you can use as a reference, such as “a sales 
increase of 10 percent” rather than “move this point from here to there.”
Visualizing a data set also helps us choose the best statistical measure. Take, for 
example, the boom right chart in Anscombe’s quartet. ere is no variation 
in x, except for a strong outlier. If you had to choose between the mean and the 
median, the laer would beer describe the distribution, because it’s not inﬂu-
enced by the outlier.
is chapter explores the intertwined nature of data visualization and statistics. 
We will not go beyond basic descriptive statistics, but that should be enough to 
understand the reasons why visualization and statistics need each other. Oen 
people evolve from a purely visual perspective to a more balanced approach 
because statistics provide a solid framework for improving their visualizations. 
e inverse is also true: Many statisticians (including Francis Anscombe, William 
Cleveland, and John Tukey) realize the need of data visualization for beer 
statistical analysis.

10 I SCATTERED DATA
225
I must confess that I remember well when I was unable to understand one of the 
examples presented later in this chapter—the box-and-whisker plot. I thought 
I needed to put a couple of hours aside to decipher it. en one day I saw it super-
imposed on the data points and it took me less than a minute to realize how simple 
the chart is, and that there was nothing complex to decipher. e box-and-whisker 
plot is just a visual list of cut-oﬀ points. Sometimes, the right image is all you 
need to understand something that immediately becomes simple and obvious.
The Data
I will risk asserting that if you visualize data on the distribution of housing, auto 
sales, or medical appointments at the U.S. state level, you’ll get very similar charts 
or maps. No divining talent is required to foresee this, for these, and many more 
variables, are strongly correlated to population. ese charts and maps basically 
display population distribution. A more interesting approach is to measure how 
much the variable actually diverges from that distribution.
All data comes with its own baggage of surrounding knowledge, opinions, 
and misconceptions, which simply can’t be avoided. But I wanted to use a data 
set that could minimize this baggage. Since I was free to choose whatever data I 
wanted for this book, the 2012 U.S. Census of Agriculture seemed a good choice 
(Figure 10.2, on the following page). Of course, this means that you’ll learn more 
about the distribution of goats or bee colonies than you’d expected. When I chose 
this data set, I assumed that the correlation with population distribution would 
be weak and perhaps even negative. I added humans as one of the species, so we 
can analyze that too.
When data have a spatial dimension, we’re naturally curious about any spatial 
paerns. In fact, you should always check for those paerns, but if they prove 
uninteresting, don’t bother keeping the maps. Maps aren’t easy to make in an 
out-of-the-box Excel installation—although it became easier with Excel 2016. As 
a bonus, I’ll include a section on maps (made in Excel) for the data we’re using. 
But until then we’ll work with unidentiﬁed data points.

Distribution
“Distribution” refers to how the values of a variable are placed along an axis, keep-
ing the proportional distances taken from the values in the table. In descriptive 
statistics, there are two complementary ways to study a distribution: searching 
for what is common (the measures of central tendency) and searching for what 
is diﬀerent along with how much diﬀerent it is (measures of dispersion).
Ploing the individual points of a variable along an axis results in the creation 
of a strip plot that mimics the characteristics of the proto-chart. We have to add 
titles and labeling, but changes are otherwise minor and result from the need to 
ensure that all points are visible, even when they overlap.
Showing Everything: Transparencies and Jittering
Making all points visible ensures maximum accuracy (unless the presence of an 
outlier jeopardizes the chart’s resolution). Showing all the points is useful, but 
it can also prove to be excessively noisy, not allowing the reader to generalize 
the results.
When there are many similar or identical data points, they’ll overlap, and the 
chart reader may not be able to evaluate how much the data points are concen-
trated. A single dot can hide many others. A strong concentration combined with 
a wide range makes this even more serious. at’s why a single outlier can ruin 
an otherwise acceptable resolution.
When you still get overlapping data points aer changing marker size and type, 
chart size, or scale range, you have a few options you can resort to (Figure 10.3). 
Choosing a dark tone for the marker and seing a high percentage of transparency 
can help create a sense of density. Or you can go all the way and simply remove 
the ﬁll color and use a simple shape, like a ring.

DATA AT WORK
228
If everything else fails, adding a very small amount of random variation to 
separate the dots (“jiering”) can minimize overlapping without inﬂuencing 
the way you read the data. When you use jiering, it’s always advisable to add a 
note explaining it.
Quantifying Impressions
One of the ﬁrst things we’ll notice in the distribution of horses and ponies is the 
strong outlier at about 400,000, which is far above all other states. e remaining 
states seem to be loosely grouped in three clusters. We can guess that the mean 
should fall in the middle one, so it should be around the 70,000 mark.
It would be useful to validate and quantify our impressions: Where exactly is the 
center of the distribution? How much variation should we consider “normal”? 
Can we quantify the limits above or below which a point should be considered 
an outlier? Figure 10.4 can tell us more about this. Let’s remove the outlier for a 
moment so that we can use the chart at a higher resolution.
Take a look at the position of the two triangles, representing the median and 
the mean. e median is clearly to the le of the mean and near the darker area.

Mean and Standard Deviation
e mean is useful when variation is small and when the values are distributed 
more or less symmetrically to the le and to the right. A quick look shows that 
this is not the case here: Even without counting the outlier, the three values to 
the right skew the distribution and impact on the mean. For this reason, the mean 
seems somewhat inﬂated and is not the best measure to represent the center point 
of this distribution. e horizontal dark red line marks the standard deviation 
(the amount of dispersion) from the mean, and is also clearly inﬂuenced by the 
values above 130,000.
The Median and the Interquartile Range
Another measure, the median, is the middle point of an ordered list of data points. 
For example, in (1,2,3,4,5), the median is 3. Because the median takes into account 
the position of the data points more than it does the actual values, it’s unaﬀected by 
outliers. If instead of (1,2,3,4,5) you have (1,2,3,4,500), you still get the same median. 
at’s why the median is lower than the mean in the example of horses and 
ponies. When a distribution is symmetrical, mean and median have the same value.
As you can see, the median is not a calculation that takes into account the whole 
data, but rather just a cut-oﬀ point that splits the distribution in two. You can 
use this logic and split the distribution in other places. A common split is in three 
places, to get four sections, or quartiles, where each quartile contains a percent-
age of the data points in the ordered list: Q1 contains the boom 25 percent, Q2 
contains 50 percent and Q3 contains 75 percent. It follows that 50 percent of 
the data points fall between Q1 and Q3. is is called the interquartile range and

it’s represented in the top chart of Figure 10.4 by the red line. Unlike the mean, 
where the range of the standard deviation is equal to the le and to the right, the 
median does not have to be at the center of the interquartile range. e fact that 
the median is not at the center reveals the distribution skewness.
Outliers
In Figure 10.5, I temporarily set the value of the outlier to zero. If you compare 
this chart to the previous one, you’ll see that the impact on the median and the 
quartiles is negligible (it changes a bit because the value was moved to the bot-
tom half of the list), while the mean becomes much closer to the median and the 
standard deviation is greatly reduced.

In the analysis of distributions, the treatment of outliers has been gaining 
increasing interest. An outlier may correspond to an error (for example, when on 
a scale from 1 to 5, a value of 6 is entered). Outliers are a common feature of certain 
distributions (Washington, D.C., for example, will appear as a clear outlier in a 
list of states by population density) or something that needs further investiga-
tion. Imagine, for example, that sales in a sales territory are much beer than 
expected. It’s useful to understand why this is happening and if it can be rep-
licated elsewhere. Whatever the case, an outlier is almost always interesting 
and should not be overlooked.

It seems easy to identify an outlier when we see it, but it’s helpful to deﬁne the 
acceptable thresholds, because in many cases what qualiﬁes as an outlier is not 
as obvious as it is in this case.
ere is no single methodology to deﬁne an outlier and how it should be calculated. 
Figure 10.6 displays a red tick line, corresponding to the interquartile range (top) 
and the standard deviation from the mean (boom). ink of the thinner, light 
red line as marking a transition zone beyond which we should consider any point 
an outlier. e range of this transition zone is calculated:
 
I
For the median, by multiplying the interquartile range by 1.5 and adding 
this product to Q3 and subtracting it from Q1. 
I
For the mean, by adding or subtracting two standard deviations.
If there are no outliers, these limits are capped at the minimum and maximum 
values. Both methods agree that there is a single outlier in this distribution.

Box-and-Whisker Plots
e strip plot gives us an accurate picture of the distribution of points along the 
axis. However, it’s easy to feel that there is nothing concrete that we can hold on to. 
We need something that summarizes those values and at the same time provides 
anchor points that help us read the distribution. at’s the reason we’ve been add-
ing metrics that help us understand the structure in a more quantiﬁed manner.
Now that we have a prey good idea of the distribution, perhaps we’re geing 
overzealous by displaying all the data points. Aren’t we risking not seeing the 
overall picture, with all those distractor points? Perhaps we should simplify and 
emphasize only the key points, and ﬁnd a way to compare all the series in the 
table. Wouldn’t that be a beer allocation of our resources?
It certainly would be, and the best way to do it is through the box-and-whisker 
plot. We don’t really have much to do, because the chart is already present in 
Figure 10.6: If you consider the top distribution, the “box” is the thick red line (the 
interquartile range) and the “whiskers” are the light red lines extending from 
there, deﬁning the thresholds beyond which only the outliers remain.
One of my clients was somewhat uncomfortable with a suggestion to use the me-
dian instead of the mean (the presence of strong outliers justiﬁed it). He wasn’t 
sure whether users were aware of the diﬀerence between the two metrics. If we’re 
at this level of numeric literacy, the box-and-whisker plot may not appear to be 
the best graphical representation, because of its abstraction and its use of less 
familiar statistical concepts like quartiles. However, this chart deserves some 
investment because, in most instances, it satisfactorily describes the distribution 
with an acceptable loss of detail.
e box-and-whisker plot may not give a perfectly correct image of the distribution 
where there are two very populated areas around the median creating a bipolar 
distribution, which is not visible on the chart. However, we can compensate for 
this weakness of the box-and-whisker plot by keeping the data points visible, 
by varying the width of the box depending on the density of points, or by some 
other creative solution.

Z-Scores
It would be nice to compare distributions, but a glance at the table from Figure 10.2 
will make us think twice: We can’t compare 1.6 billion broiler chickens with a 
few million horses.
To make comparisons possible, we need to transform the data. One of the com-
mon ways of achieving this is by calculating the z-scores, whereby each variable 
is transformed so that its mean is set to zero and its standard deviation is set to 
one. All data points in each distribution become positive or negative, depending 
on whether they fall above or below the mean.
Aer calculating the z-scores, we can compare the distributions (Figure 10.7).  
It’s clear that all have strong outliers. ere are several variability proﬁles.  
For example, variability in goats is much lower than in the number of horses 
and ponies.

Figure 10.8 allows us to compare the distributions using multiple box-and-whisker 
plots.¹ We can see that they’re ordered by the median value, and many other 
details are now clearer. In the boom two distributions, goats have a much lower
variability than horses and ponies, but its outlier is much stronger. In several 
distributions, deciding whether a data point is an outlier is not as simple as in 
the example of horses and ponies, but the box-and-whisker plot sets a criterion 
we can follow.
Note that I opted to keep all the data points, although usually a box-and-whisker 
plot displays the outliers only.
1 Microso implemented box-and-whisker plots in Excel 2016. Like the other new charts, they’re 
not as ﬂexible as the existing charts in the library. For example, in the current version, there is no 
option for making horizontal box-and-whisker plots. ose in Figure 10.8 were made from a scaer 
plot, which is a very time-consuming process.

The Pareto Chart Revisited
Outliers and variability suggest another way of reading distributions, which is by 
analyzing their cumulative values. So, let’s return to the Pareto chart. In a Pareto 
chart, the line of cumulative values always lies within the shaded top triangle 
(Figure 10.9), wherein the diagonal line represents the minimum concentration, 
and a single data point at the topmost le corner would correspond to the highest 
concentration (all horses in a single state).
You’ll certainly wonder whether the distribution of horses and ponies is similar to 
other species. e answer is no, as we see in Figure 10.9, where you can compare 
their distribution to hogs and pigs. It’s clear that although you can ﬁnd many 
horses almost everywhere, hogs and pigs are much more concentrated. A single 
state holds more than 30 percent of the population.
In Figure 10.10, you’ll ﬁnd a Pareto chart for each of the animal species in our 
livestock analysis (and also for humans). I shaded part of the top le triangle 
to show how cumulative values vary for all these distributions. For each state, 
I recorded the maximum and minimum values. I also added reference lines 
in the 50 percent and 80 percent cumulative values. For example, turkeys follow 
the Pareto principle: 80 percent of the population can be found in 20 percent 
of the states, while you need 56 percent of the states to get 80 percent of horses 
and ponies.

Excel Maps
It’s a pity that, for far too long, basic thematic mapping was absent from an out-
of-the-box Excel installation. To circumvent that before Excel 2016, I kept playing 
with the available options, such as:
 
I
Using shapes (a state is a shape) and coloring them through programming.
 
I
Using very small cells to draw low-resolution regions, with conditional 
formaing and without programming. e resulting maps look somewhat 
rustic, but good enough for most basic tasks.
 
I
When mapping Walmart stores (recall Figure 5.20), I used a scaer plot to 
display counties and stores.
Excel 2016 now comes with 3D Maps. e name is alarming, but you can make a 
Region map and ignore the other options. I used 3D Maps to map our livestock 
data in Figure 10.11. I split the distributions into ﬁve bins, using percentiles 20, 
40, 60, and 80.

Don’t forget that sometimes we pay too much aention to the spatial dimension 
just because we can make a map, even if it doesn’t reveal signiﬁcant paerns, 
and we overlook other dimensions and relationships that can be revealed by a 
simpler, non-spatial display.
Histograms
Each of the counties in the U.S. is shown in Figures 10.12 and 10.13. ere are so 
many points that vertical jiering was applied to facilitate seeing the density of 
points. In Figure 10.12² the technique worked well and allows for an acceptable 
breakdown of data points. In Figure 10.13, on the contrary, the distribution is so 
skewed that the only remedy to improve discrimination would be to use a log scale.
2 Note that we are taking into account the number of counties only, regardless of their population. 
In a more thorough analysis, you should weight them.

We saw how useful the box-and-whisker plot is at synthesizing a distribution 
through a set of measures such as the median and the interquartile range. But 
what if we want to know how many cases there are in an interval? For example, 
how many counties fall within the 15 percent to 20 percent poverty range? at’s 
something you can’t really answer with a box-and-whisker plot.
e histogram answers questions like that, however. Unlike in the box-and-whisker 
plot, we need to deﬁne bins (classes or intervals) and count how many cases 
fall inside each bin. e problem is that there is no simple way of deﬁning those 
bins and their cut-oﬀ points, which opens the door to malicious manipulations. 
But let’s assume good faith. Figures 10.12 and 10.13 show that we need diﬀerent 
approaches to get a good portrait of each of these distributions.

Bin Number and Width
When deﬁning the number of classes (bins) in a histogram, you must ﬁnd the 
right balance between resolution and the task. On the one hand, the number of 
bins should be as small as possible without loss of relevant details. On the other 
hand, the task may impose a speciﬁc goal that forces a predeﬁned bin number or 
bin width. Take the preceding example: If you want to know how many counties 
fall within the 15 percent to 20 percent poverty range, you’ll have to use a 5-point 
bin width, but you’ll want to check if and how this inﬂuences the overall shape.
ere is no simple way to determine the appropriate number of bins, because 
this number depends on the range of the data, the number of points (n), and the 
actual proﬁle of the distribution. You can ﬁnd suggestions ranging from general 
impressions, such as “5 to 20,” to more formulaic alternatives. You can approach 
the problem from two perspectives:
 
I
e number of observations (n). With the Rice rule (2n⅓), we would get 
around 30 bins for 3143 counties.
 
I
Bin width. Freedman–Diaconis’s rule: 2(IQR(x)/n⅓), where IQR is the inter-
quartile range. e result for the population data can be rounded to a bin 
width of 7,500. e use of IQR means that the result will not be inﬂuenced 
by outliers.
Whatever the methodology used, it should not avoid a qualitative assessment of 
the appropriate number of bins. Freedman–Diaconis’s formula seems to be a good 
compromise between a fully empirical decision and overly complex formulas for 
something that does not prevent an arbitrary decision.
e distribution of counties by percent poverty draws a reasonably symmetric 
bell-shaped curve with a few not-too-pronounced outliers. We can easily justify 
any number of bins or any bin width, and we’d have to try hard to mess up the 
curve. As you can see, all bin widths in Figure 10.14 do an acceptable job of show-
ing the shape of the distribution. For the top histogram, I calculated the number 
of bins and rounded the width to 2. e boom le and boom right histograms 
use 5-point and 1-point bin widths, respectively. e 2-point bin width will not tell 
you how many counties there are in the 15 percent to 20 percent poverty range, 
but if you ﬁnd the 5-point width acceptable, you should use that histogram.

e population histogram is much harder to set up (Figure 10.15). Since we’re 
using same-width bins, we’ll always end up with a strong overﬂow bin (the last 
bin on the right). I decided that the overﬂow bin should not include more than 
10 percent of all counties, so the cut-oﬀ point will be counties with more than 
210,000 inhabitants. If you set the bin width at 7,500, you’ll get 29 bins, close to 
Rice’s formula.

Now, do you think that a county with 2,500 inhabitants is similar to another with

with one million? If you believe they have signiﬁcantly diﬀerent qualities, you 
may need to tweak the bin width, number of bins, and overﬂow bin until you ﬁnd 
a suitable result. Make sure that your message is consistent with your design and 
that both are consistent with the overall shape of the data.

Histograms and Bar Charts
It’s important to clarify the diﬀerence between histograms and bar charts, as 
they are very similar visually. A bar chart represents categorical values with an 
arbitrary order. To show that there is no continuity between values, the bars 
should be represented with a gap between them.
e histogram, in turn, refers to sections in a quantitative axis, wherein a bin’s 
upper limit coincides with the next bin’s lower limit. In histograms, bars are not 
separated by spaces. In Figure 10.16, the chart on the le is a histogram, where class 
limits are clearly deﬁned. In the bar chart on the right, I deﬁned seven categorical 
classes, and I can even rank them, something that I can’t do with a histogram.
One of the new charts in Excel 2016 is the histogram, and I used it to make the 
histograms in this section. Again, this is still a bare-bones implementation that 
doesn’t allow for the level of control we’re accustomed to with other charts. 
Hopefully, we’ll be given more control over Excel histograms in the future.

Figure 10.17 shows what happens when we order the counties in ascending order 
of population, set the vertical axis to display the cumulative frequency, and set 
the horizontal axis to display county size. Since we have a very wide range, the 
horizontal axis must be set to log scale.³ I added an inset to show what the line

A log scale with secondary gridlines allows for a more precise reading. With a

Takeaways
 
I
Statistics and data visualization should be seen as complementary methods, 
where one reinforces the other and both have advantages.
 
I
When ploing data points, always minimize point overlapping by choosing 
transparencies, rings, alternative marker sizes, or all three. Or, if necessary, 
add a small amount of random variation.
 
I
A distribution is oen too noisy to yield meaningful insights without 
additional help, in which case you can use statistical methods to ﬁnd key 
anchor points.
 
I
Oen, noise is not necessarily bad. You may choose to mute it but keep it 
in the chart.
 
I
Have a plan for dealing with outliers, because they are interesting.
 
I
Box-and-whisker plots are great charts for comparing distributions.
 
I
Use Pareto charts to display the cumulative frequency of distributions to 
learn more about cumulative eﬀects.
 
I
Unlike bar charts, histograms show continuity between adjacent values 
and therefore have no gaps between their vertical bars.
 
I
When using histograms, test several bin widths and numbers of bins to 
ﬁnd the best combination for the task.

CHANGE OVER TIME
Tobler’s ﬁrst law of geography (“Everything is related to everything 
else, but near things are more related than distant things”) could be 
applied to both space and time. For many variables, variation from 
one time period to the next tends to follow a reasonably smooth path. 
Any abrupt changes draw our aention and must be investigated.

DATA AT WORK
250
It’s perfectly acceptable to focus our aention on describing the now, but in most 
cases a larger time frame helps us understand where we are, why we are here, 
and where we should expect to go. But the importance of time also depends on 
the complexity of our economic or social systems (more, and more vocal, social 
minorities make societies more complex). Today, many variables vary more 
sharply than they did 50 years ago. For example, high-frequency trading is an 
extreme example within the extreme example of stock volatility. Also, the past 
is not uniform: ere are almost invisible long-term paerns and cycles with 
unwanted consequences (such as population aging and the credit cycle), and 
there are short-term paerns (like unemployment rate) that we are more aware 
of because they aﬀect our daily lives more immediately.
Focus on the Flow: 
The Line Chart
Most rivers ﬂow relatively smoothly. eir general ﬂow tends toward a point, 
even if, at the local level, it appears to keep twisting and turning and changing 
course unexpectedly (Figure 11.1).
Since at least the time of ancient Greek philosophers, the river has been the 
preferred metaphor for describing the ﬂow of time. It’s natural, therefore, that 
a metaphorical river, a line, is the primary representation of time in data visu-
alization. We do use other charts to represent time, and we do use line charts 
to display non-temporal data, but the combination of time series and the line 
chart is especially useful. It respects the direction of time (from le to right) and 
focuses on the ﬂow (rather than on individual data points) that will be read as 
meaningful trends and paerns.

e line chart is one of the best and most ﬂexible types of charts for displaying 
change over time. It isn’t perfect, though. Some nuances may escape it, and at 
times it may also suggest nonexistent relationships, so we’ll discuss alternative 
formats as well.
e line chart at the top in Figure 11.2 shows a clear and stable evolution in the 
volume of nights spent in tourist accommodations by residents in Spain. e 
evolution of non-residents is more complex: an upward trend that increases and 
turns into exponential growth, followed by a plateau during the ﬁrst decade of 
this century, and then a return to growth over the last years.
Although we focus on the ﬂow when reading line charts, if there are signiﬁcant 
changes it’s a good idea to make data points in the line more prominent (using 
labeled markers, in this case) to help quantify local variations.
e boom bar chart uses the same data but suggests a diﬀerent approach. Instead 
of paerns and trends, it favors pair-wise analysis (annual and between the 
two series).

When reading a line chart, we need to realize that we can discuss paerns and 
trends in each series, but we must be careful when drawing any conclusions about 
the relationship between two variables. As an example of exploring the relationship 
between variables, a quick chart made using William Playfair’s 18th-century data 
(Figure 11.3) reveals a huge depression in the ﬁrst half of the time series when 
using the ratio of exports to imports rather than absolute values. ese two charts 
complement each other—one revealing details that are missing in the other.
Ratios have the additional advantage of making the message clearer: In 2000 and 
2001, non-residents spent two nights in tourist accommodations for each night 
spent by residents (Figure 11.4).

Using ratios is a simple and familiar way of geing some sense of the relationship 
between two variables. Variables that are oen seen together, such as imports 
versus exports, budget versus actual, or female versus male, gain meaning when 
presented both with absolute values and with ratios.
Scales and Aspect Ratios
When you’re dealing with scales, line charts are more complex than bar charts. 
We compare heights in bar charts, and the only way to do so is to keep the scale 
intact (starting at zero, with no breaks). No maer what you do, if you don’t break 
the scale you’ll always be able to compare two bars correctly and calculate their 
absolute or relative diﬀerence.
ere isn’t a general rule to apply regarding what a line chart should look like, 
or what the “right” slope should be. When you change a chart’s aspect ratio you 
change the slope. You can also manipulate it by changing the scale. is means 
that we can break the scale and take advantage of it to improve resolution by 
deﬁning a scale range around the maximum and minimum data points. A good 
reference to start with is to set the average slope to around 45º. (is “banking 
to 45º” was ﬁrst proposed by William Cleveland.¹)
e slope of the line is a design issue and to a lesser extent a functional issue. 
One slope can make a paern easier to spot than another slope, so you should test 
aspect ratios and scales that push the slope below or above 45º.
Whatever angle you choose, a slope is always meaningless on its own because 
there are no reference points (except for the horizontal reference line that marks 
an upward or a downward trend). It acquires meaning only when compared to 
other slopes.
e top charts in Figure 11.5 illustrate a discussion held a few years ago on the 
federal tax rate for the 1 percent richest Americans. e chart on the top le shows 
a sharp decline, while in the chart on the top right, the authors, arguing that the 
scale should include all potential tax rate levels, show that it had essentially sta-
bilized. (is rationale would ﬂaen out every chart under the sun, by the way.)
We can say that the chart on the top le is beer because it allows us to see change 
in more detail. But we can’t infer from it that the tax rate for the super-rich is 
nose-diving, nor we can say aer reading the chart at the top right that the tax 
rate is ﬂat.

e only real solution is to add references so that the slope in this series can be 
compared to other similar series and thus gain meaning.
e boom chart may have an answer. First, we need to display not the top 1 per-
cent of households but all four groups within the top 20 percent. Next, we want 
to know, not how much federal tax each group actually pays, but how much it 
has changed since 1993 (because the original discussion was focused on how 
much it changed).
THE TOP 1% IS PAYING LESS AND LESS TAX
TAXES PAID BY THE TOP 1% REMAIN UNCHANGED
Average federal tax rate for top 1% households
Average federal tax rate for top 1% households

Now, when we display the data we can almost say that, the less rich a household 
is, the less tax it’s paying (when comparing to 1993). is works perfectly for the 
boom three groups, but not for the top 1 percent, which is enjoying a higher cut 
in its tax rate than all the others (and it started earlier). You still can’t judge the 
meaning of a slope, but you can say for certain one of the groups has been treated 
favorably when compared to other groups.
When you have more than one series you have more ﬂexibility to change aspect 
ratios or the scale on the vertical axis, and you should take advantage of it to 
improve resolution or make paerns clearer. When you have a single series, con-
sider using a bar chart instead of a line chart if you have only a few data points 
and if you can get good resolution without breaking the scale. Above all, make 
sure your audience doesn’t jump to conclusions based on a single slope.
Focus on the Relationships: 
Connected Scatter Plots
We can view a line chart as a special form of scaer plot, in which the relationship 
is established between the variable value in the vertical axis and the corresponding 
time period in the horizontal axis. Variables in a line chart vary independently, 
which means that when we have two or more variables, we can’t infer much about 
their relationships, even if they appear to vary in the same direction. When we 
establish a relationship between the variables in a scaer plot, we lose the tem-
poral dimension and are le with only a snapshot of the moment.
is need not be so. ere are cases where a similar evolution hides deep changes 
in the relationship, and in other cases we detect changes but are unaware of how 
signiﬁcant they are.
Figure 11.6 shows a rendition of a chart published by Time magazine (international 
edition, November 4, 2013). e use of two axes and the broken scale on the le 
mean that the author wanted to highlight a relationship between the evolution of 
the two variables. As we’ll see in Chapter 14, however, the secondary axis should 
not be used in these circumstances.

11 I CHANGE OVER TIME
257
If we do want to know what kind of relationship is established between two vari-
ables over time, we have to plot one against the other. Each data point marks the 
values in both variables for a given year (or other time period), and by connecting 
the data points we can see how the relationship evolved over time. 
Figure 11.7 shows what happens when you apply this connected scaer plot to 
the data from Figure 11.6. It becomes obvious that there are four phases in the 
relationship between troops and army budget:
 
I
Ronald Reagan keeps increasing the budget without changing the number 
of troops. Russia (then the USSR) was unable to cope with this and the Cold 
War ﬁnally ends.
 
I
With the end of the Cold War, the U.S. begins a decade-long period of troop 
reduction, even during other wars (such as the Gulf War, in 1991).
 
I
e next decade begins with the 9/11 aacks, the Afghanistan War, and the 
Iraq War (2003). is forces a signiﬁcant increase in the army budget, but 
only a marginal increase in the number of troops.
 
I
Aer the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, there is a downward trend in the budget 
and no change in personnel.

is chart clearly shows how during the turn of each decade signiﬁcant changes 
took place in the relationship between the number of troops and the army budget. 
Probably due to the nature of new challenges and technological advances, a repeat 
of the inﬂated number of troops during the Cold War now seems unlikely.
Because we should, whenever possible, try to understand relationships between 
variables and not only describe each one of them in isolation, scaer plots are 
the most powerful charts available to us. e connected scaer plot is not easy 
to read at ﬁrst, but I strongly encourage you to become familiar with it—at least 
during the exploratory stage—to check for relevant shapes in the relationships. 
Whenever you feel the need to use a dual-axis chart with two independent vari-
ables, you should try the connected scaer plot ﬁrst.
Sudden Changes: 
The Step Chart
In most circumstances, it’s reasonable to assume that the evolution from one state 
to another is a continuous and smooth process: If a product sells 100 units in a 
month and 110 in the following month, it’s likely that the sale of additional units 
has spread over the entire month. Based on the evolution of sales by the middle 
of the month, it may be possible to estimate the ﬁnal sales.
In other cases, a change is abrupt and has no intermediate steps. e ranking of 
a football team has no decimal values. In certain product categories, prices can 
be le unchanged for several months or even years. A standard line chart is not the 
ideal method for displaying these changes that lack intermediate states, because 
the line chart represents a slope instead of a vertical line.

Since 1998, several postal services throughout Europe underwent restructuring 
and privatization, following an EU regulation. In some cases, you need only look 
at the price index for these services to guess when the company was privatized. 
e chart in Figure 11.8 shows that the index for postal services hardly changed 
over the years, with only minor corrections in January each year, if any. Aer 
they were privatized, frequent price hikes became the new normal. is is a 
step chart, and the orange series captures the nature of the price index in postal 
services much beer than a standard line chart.
If you look closely, you’ll see that the all-items index (the gray line) also evolves in 
steps. However, the use of a step chart in this case clearly misses the point, because 
only on rare occasions is the index le unchanged from one month to the next.

e step chart is between a line chart and a bar chart. It still displays a trend like 
a line chart halfway, and because of the vertical lines, it forces you to pay more 
aention to variation between data points, like a bar chart. You could take this 
as the best of both worlds, but Figure 11.8 proves that you have to have the right 
data and the right variation to make a useful step chart.
Seasonality: The Cycle Plot
A simple representation of the ﬂow of time is the most obvious way to display 
change, but it can be inadequate in certain circumstances. In the U.S., for example, 
you would want to compare turkey sales in November with turkey sales from 
November of the previous year, rather than from October. Or if you are a sandwich 
restaurant owner, you might want to compare aendance between 12:00 pm and 
1:00 pm each day of the week.
Tourism is a good example of seasonality. Figure 11.9 (on the following page)
shows how strong the tourism cycle is in Italy. We can see that nights spent by 
non-residents plateaued at about 50 million and that nights spent by residents 
are consistently increasing.
We can’t really say much more when the data is presented this way. When there 
is a clear cyclic paern in the data, we have to gather and analyze all the data for 
each moment of the cycle to ﬁnd the underlying structure. See what happens 
when we compare the data for each of the twelve months (Figure 11.10 on the 
following page). e cycle is still there, but now we get a lot of details:
 
I
e large increase in nights spent by residents in July and August over the 
last years.
 
I
e months when residents spend more nights than non-residents.
 
I
e traditional huge gap between residents and non-residents in August.
 
I
e drop in non-resident nights in recent years.
 
I
e sudden drop in nights spent in 2002. (I couldn’t ﬁnd a good reason for 
this, but I don’t want to assume without further investigation that this is 
a data error.)

Sparklines
Sparklines is a term coined by Edward Tue to designate “intense, simple, word-
sized graphics”—that is, graphics that could be integrated into the text ﬂow 
to show, for example, how the results evolved 
 for the 
Spanish soccer team Real Sociedad during the 2014–2015 season (red: losses; 
black: wins; spaces: ties).
As the name implies, sparklines began as very small line charts, but bar or area 
charts are also used successfully as sparklines. e most notable feature of a spark-
line is its extremely reduced size. Its compactness is obtained at the expense of 
removing all support elements and through miniaturizing data-encoding objects.
Beyond Tue’s books, I couldn’t ﬁnd many examples of sparklines integrated into 
the text, as suggested by Tue, but several vendors, including Microso, have 
added sparklines to their products. Now it’s very common to ﬁnd sparklines, 
especially when available space is scarce, as in dashboards. You’ll also ﬁnd that 
they’ve become popular on the sports page (Figure 11.11).

Using sparklines is not as simple as it might 
seem. You must ensure that variation is as clear 
as possible. Figure 11.11 represents a best-case 
scenario: Only three possible states (positive, 
neutral, or negative) mean that you don’t have to 
worry about the level of detail or how to choose 
the right scale, while color helps separate posi-
tive and negative values.
Sparklines are an interesting concept, but there 
are a few issues associated with their extreme 
miniaturization, among which is the removal 
of the vertical axes and the consequent absence 
of quantitative references. 
Figure 11.12 represents the monthly unemploy-
ment rate at the U.S. state level. e ﬁrst group 
of two columns displays the actual rate, while 
the second group displays the ratio between 
the state rate and the national rate, where red 
means “above national rate” and blue means 
“below national rate.” Within each group, the 
sparklines in the ﬁrst column are comparable 
because they share a common scale, while in 
the second column of each group you can’t 
compare states because each sparkline has an 
independent scale, allowing for a beer reso-
lution. Both of these options are legitimate, 
but it’s likely that your audience will tend to 
compare sparklines. You should make it clear 
which option is currently applied and, if pos-
sible, let the audience choose between them. 
Compare this display with the horizon chart in 
Chapter 13, which uses the same data.

Tue suggested some ways to minimize this problem of multiple individual scales 
versus a single shared scale, particularly by indicating the values of certain rel-
evant points (ﬁrst, last, major, minor), but also by overlapping a ﬂuctuation band 
of typical values in order to emphasize the points outside this band.
Stephen Few sought to address the problem of scales² and then proposed the 
concept of bandlines,³ in which the background color encodes quartiles in an 
aempt to ﬁnd a middle ground between the individual scales and a shared scale.
Animation
Earlier I mentioned Hans Rosling’s ﬁrst TED conference, “e best stats you’ve 
ever seen.” If you haven’t done so already, watch it now. Rosling’s conference is 
a great example of skilled communication with data and of using animation the 
right way. He uses a tool named Trendalyzer, and you can ﬁnd an interactive 
online version and play with some datasets at Gapminder’s site.
What is “animation”? If you’re a PowerPoint user, you know that Animations is 
one of the top menu options. You use it to make objects pulse, teeter, spin, grow, 
shrink, swivel, bounce, ﬂow in, ﬂy out, or fade—or simply appear, if you aren’t 
an imaginative person. Apple’s Keynote animations are even cooler, and include 
ﬁreworks and ﬂames.
But animation in data visualization is not exactly that. In data visualization, 
animation happens when a bar gets shorter, a point changes position, or a line 
slope is smoothed over time. ese changes result from changes in the underlying 
data, usually when a new period in a time series is selected.
If you stop a movie, you can see what’s happening in the still image—for example, 
a donkey talking to a heavy green creature with funnel ears. But why are they 
talking and what will happen next? You don’t know, because only a sequence of 
frames will tell you that.

e same is true for animation in data visualization. If you stop Hans Rosling’s 
talk while he’s displaying data for a given year, you won’t be able to detect any 
paerns beyond those currently visible in the image. But aer watching the en-
tire sequence, you’ll see a global movement of countries in a particular direction, 
even if that movement is less than linear in individual cases.
Just as you need a map to discover spatial paerns, you need a sequence to discover 
time paerns. Animation not only helps you detect paerns, but it’s also a cool
way of presenting change over time. If you can add great verbal communication 
skills, you’ll deliver a memorable presentation.
But there is a catch. Animation doesn’t show you a paern; you use the sequence 
to build a paern in your brain, and working memory plays an active role in 
this. e small storage space and volatility of our working memory mean that 
animation can’t be used in data visualization when the data display multiple and 
complex paerns over time. In Rosling’s talk, you see that countries simply moved 
from the boom right corner of his chart to the top le corner. No other paerns 
emerge. If you want to show an animation, you must ensure that there is a single 
paern, that the paern is easy to detect, and that it ﬂows as smoothly as possible.
If, instead of a presentation with a ﬁxed sequence, your audience is given an in-
teractive tool to play with, things can be a bit more interesting. e tool doesn’t 
need to be as sophisticated as Trendalyzer, but it should at least allow for basic 
interaction, with pause, forward, and back/rewind buons.
If, for whatever reason, it’s not possible to use animation, using several small charts 
(also known as “small multiples”) is a great alternative. Figure 11.13 contains 31 
small population pyramids that show how the age structure of the U.S. population 
changed since 1950 and how its evolution is projected until 2100. e paern is 
clear, so it’s a good candidate for animation, but with a multitude of small images 
you can study the changes in more detail. Having today’s age structure ﬁxed in 
each background in a lighter color shade acts as a reference and helps us beer 
evaluate both past and future changes.

Takeaways
 
I
Time is one of the fundamental dimensions in data analysis, and it should 
be represented whenever possible.
 
I
e line chart is the default chart for visualizing a time series, because the 
line emphasizes the ﬂow (and thus the trend). Use a bar chart if you want 
to compare data points instead.
 
I
Markers are not required in a line chart, but you should use them for sub-
stantial turning points, outliers, or other signiﬁcant cases.
 
I
Don’t assume that because two series seem to vary in a similar fashion, 
there is a direct relationship between them. Beer yet, show both.
 
I
Instead of showing a pair of variables (men/women, imports/exports), 
show the ratio between them. Beer yet, show both.
 
I
To beer observe how the relationship between two variables evolves over 
time, you need a connected scaer plot.
 
I
When a variable displays a strong cyclic paern, many of the details are 
hidden by the cycle. Slice it up and show how each moment of the cycle 
changed over time (how January changed, how February changed, and so on).
 
I
Because in a line chart you compare slopes and not heights, you can break 
the vertical scale, within reason.
 
I
Try changing the chart’s scale and aspect ratio so that you get an average 
slope of 45º. en check if that’s the right format to show the paerns.
 
I
Avoid single-series line charts. Add some type of reference, such as the 
expected variation, or a second series (for example, by comparing one 
series to a higher-level series, such as a state to the national average), or 
even consider using a bar chart.
 
I
For some variables, change is abrupt rather than gradual. A step chart oﬀers 
a more accurate picture of this sudden change.
 
I
Animation works best when there’s a single and simple paern. When you 
can’t use animation or when you want the audience to calmly go through 
the details, you can display the same sequence using small multiples.

RELATIONSHIPS
As we’ve seen, to explain the world is to look for relationships among 
the facts we observe. While you’d think it would then be easy to take 
the next step, to answer the “why,” most of the time it isn’t so easy.
Since discovering relationships is an essential step to knowledge-
building, it’s only natural to think that data visualization would have 
the right tools for revealing the why in these relationships. But in 
fact, that’s only half true at best. When we see two series in a line 
chart varying in the same direction, it’s tempting to conclude that 
there’s a direct correlation between them. However, as we learned 
in the preceding chapter, this may not be true (even if the author 
has tried to prove it by adjusting scales in the vertical axes).

DATA AT WORK
272
We can only infer the existence and nature of a covariation between two variables 
when we plot them one against the other and measure the results. But the fact 
that two variables show a similar variation does not necessarily mean that there 
is a causal relationship—that one causes the other.
A popular chart on social media showed a strong linear relationship between 
chocolate consumption by country and the number of Nobel laureates (Figure 12.1).¹ 
is is not a license to eat chocolate. A country’s wealth, among other contribut-
ing factors, allows for a higher consumption of chocolate and also an increased 
investment in science. It’s not some miraculous property of ﬂavonols found 
in chocolate.
1 Franz H. Messerli, M.D. “Chocolate Consumption, Cognitive Function, and Nobel Laureates.” New 
England Journal of Medicine. 367:1562–1564, 2012. is paper should be read as a parody.

e analysis of covariation between two variables is important and has several 
implications. If one thing changes when something else changes, it’s natural to 
assume that one causes the other. Many arguments implicitly make that assump-
tion, from political discourse to debates around the water cooler. In a true causal 
relationship, there is indeed a strong correlation between the variables. at must 
be analyzed to ensure that we get the causality right (for what is the cause and 
what is the eﬀect is not always clear).
Understanding Relationships
Relationships are complicated. Sometimes an action triggers the expected reac-
tion, sometimes it triggers the opposite reaction, and sometimes it’s met with 
indiﬀerence. We’re interested in knowing what the reaction for a given action 
will be, or at least we would like to minimize the range of possible outcomes.
Figure 12.2 summarizes what we should be looking for when analyzing relationships:
 
I
Direction. Positive, or direct, relationships mean that variation in both 
variables has the same sign: When one increases, the other also increases; 
when one decreases, the other also decreases. A perfect positive relation-
ship, or correlation, has a value of 1. Negative, or inverse, relationships have 
opposite signs: When one increases, the other decreases. A perfect negative 
correlation has a value of –1. If there is no correlation, its value is zero.
 
I
Strength. If there is a very narrow range of outcomes, the variables have a 
strong relationship (approaching either 1 or –1). If that response widens, the 
relationship becomes weak and the correlation tends toward zero. When 
the range is so wide that the response seems nothing more than a random 
value, there is no relationship and the correlation is zero. e meaning 
of a strong relationship is diﬀerent for diﬀerent people: A physicist will 
look for values above 0.9, while a value of 0.6 could be more than enough 
in psychology studies.
 
I
Shape. In its simplest and most common model, relationships are linear: 
A variation in a variable triggers a proportional variation in another vari-
able. But the nature of the relationship may change, like when it turns into 
an inverted-u shape.²
2 e Laﬀer curve is an example of a u-shaped relationship. It models the relationship between the 
level of taxation and revenue. e more taxes, the more revenue, but aer a certain level the relation-
ship becomes negative and a tax hike actually induces lower revenue.

DATA AT WORK
274
 
I
Visualization. Some characteristics are hard to spot without visualizing 
the relationship in a scaer plot. ey can be useful at ﬁnding clusters of 
data points, showing gaps, and identifying sub-populations. As shown by 
the Anscombe quartet (recall Figure 10.1), outliers inﬂuence several statis-
tical metrics, so quickly spoing them may prove invaluable for selecting 
the right metric or the right analysis. For example, when you analyze the 
relationship between income and another variable, a weak relationship 
might improve if you split the data by gender—something that will prob-
ably be obvious once you display the data.
Curve Fitting
If the ideal result of reading a scaer plot is to understand the true nature of the 
relationship, this may prove an elusive goal. You can easily get lost in a forest of 
data points that prevents you from seeing the overall paern.
In Figure 12.2, take a look at the third scaer plot under Nonlinear Shapes. Now 
imagine applying a force so powerful that it compresses the data points until a 
line is all that remains. is is the line that best describes, or best ﬁts, the data. 
e closer the original data points are to this line, the beer the ﬁt. e values 
R2 are called coeﬃcient of determination and tell us how much of the variation of 
y is described by x, and vary between 0 and 1, or between zero percent and 100 
percent. We can easily see that the red curve ﬁts the data much beer than the 
blue one, and the higher R2 value conﬁrms it.
ere are many ways to improve curve ﬁing, but at some point the curve becomes 
so speciﬁc to the data you’re working with that you can’t generalize the model 
(for use with other data), so be careful of overﬁing. To improve your model, you 
should also plot and interpret the residuals—that is, the diﬀerence between the 
observed value and the value estimated by the curve (check the second scaer 
plot under Strength in Figure 12.2).
is is the moment when general data visualization becomes visual statistics. 
I won’t continue this path in this book, but I strongly encourage you to learn more 
about how using both visualization and statistical methods can dramatically 
improve your data analysis.

The Scatter Plot
Some chart types suﬀer a signiﬁcant number of changes from the proto-chart, 
turning them into some recognizable physical object with which the audience 
has some sort of familiarity. e pie chart is the most obvious example. Charts 
displaying relationships are not immune to design excesses, but they are more 
resilient than other chart types. e scaer plot is at the opposite pole to the pie 
chart, suﬀering a minimal transformation and having a level of abstraction that 
is diﬃcult to overcome. is makes it hard to add pseudo-3D eﬀects (the third 
dimension in a scaer plot almost always carries some meaning).
Let us return to the data on livestock that we examined in Chapter 10. I’m sure the 
data will continue to suggest new questions. We analyzed livestock data within 
each species, but it’s also legitimate to ask whether there is any relationship 
between species. For example, can the high concentration of pigs and poultry 
lead us to conclude that the two species are concentrated in the same regions? 
To answer, we must analyze the correlation between pairs of species.
e scaer plot is the chart that best displays covariation between two variables, 
so it’s the most suitable type for verifying the degree of association between them.
Consider a case with a positive association between horses and goats. With a cor-
relation of 0.86, as shown in Figure 12.3, we can conclude that in each region it 
will be common to ﬁnd both species with a proportional variation between them.

on the right zooms into the gray area.

Comparing the maps in Chapter 10 conﬁrms the similarity. Also, in this case, R2 is 
around 74 percent, which means that the remaining 26 percent will be determined 
by other factors. If aer inspecting the scaer plot, you feel that a correlation of 
0.86 looks too high, you’re right: If we exclude the outlier, the correlation coeﬃcient 
drops to 0.77. So make sure you always check for the impact of outliers.
If there seems to be a positive association between certain species, the reverse 
does not seem to occur with intensity. e minimum association is only –0.08 
between broiler chickens and beef cows.³ A more negative value would indicate 
that larger poultry populations would be associated with smaller beef cow popula-
tions, and the other way around. In the case of these two species, only 4 percent 
of the variation is described by the variation of the other variable.
Showing all the possible relationships between pairs of variables in a matrix helps 
form an overall picture of these relationships, as is visible in Figure 12.4. Note 
that there are several instances in which the regression line is near horizontal, 
which shows the lack of correlation between them.
is graphic color table allows us to draw some conclusions about the data through 
just two conditional formaing rules in Excel, one for each triangle. e limits 
of the ramps were set to the theoretical limits and not to the values found in the 
table. e middle point was set to zero in the case of correlation coeﬃcients and 
to 0.5 for the coeﬃcient of determination. is allows us to realize immediately 
that the positive associations are much stronger than the negative associations 
(lower triangle), and the coeﬃcient of determination is low in almost all cases 
(upper triangle).
3 Bear in mind that, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, beef cows are cale raised for 
meat production and dairy cows are raised for milk production. ese two are subsets of the category 
“Cale and calves.” is should be taken into account when reading the charts in this chapter.

Scatter Plot Design
Your goal when designing a scaer plot is to make the relationship between two 
variables as clear as possible, including the overall level of association but also 
revealing clusters and outliers. is is easier said than done. e data and a few 
bad design choices can make reading a scaer plot too complex or misleading.
Figure 12.6 shows the structure of a basic scaer plot. If you’re ploing one vari-
able against the other, in a perfect relationship all data points would lie along 
the 45º diagonal. is is the line that splits the plot area into a top and a boom 
triangle. In some cases, this is the reference line, and your goal is to check the 
distances between the line and the data points (for example, earnings by gender 
in Figure 5.5).

Scaer plots are naturally square, because this makes the 45º diagonal more obvi-
ous, and identical distances between data points maintain their relationship both 
horizontally and vertically. You need to scale both axes accordingly.
Figure 12.7 shows that if we follow these rules by the book, we’ll get a very low-
resolution chart (top chart). However, if we trim the empty areas, we get beer 
resolution without distorting the proportions (boom chart). Since we’re not 
using bars or other similar objects, we can break the scale.

Having the same scale in both axes and, if needed, trimming the scale to show only 
the useful area is the ideal case. If you think one of the axes could have beer 
resolution, you should add clues to make sure the reader adapts to this change in 
proportions. In the chart on the right of Figure 12.8, we improved resolution of the 
y axis cuing it by half (1:2), kept the 45° reference line, and added the line of best ﬁt.

Clusters and Groupings 
Oen as interesting as the relationship between two variables is the way data 
points cluster together. When visualizing data on European countries, we come to 
expect some groupings: Western Europe versus Eastern Europe, Baltic countries, 
Nordic countries, Mediterranean countries. Sometimes, these groupings are 
obvious due to the Gestalt law of proximity. In other cases, you’ll have to explore 
and add more variables that make these groupings emerge.
Likewise, in the U.S., in many variables we expect to ﬁnd states in the West and 
South regions (as deﬁned by the U.S. Census Bureau) in opposite poles. When 
ploing hypertension versus diabetes, for example (Figure 12.9), it’s clear that 
not only is there a strong relationship between the two but also that when 
adding a categorical variable (Region), a spatial paern seems to be uncovered. 
Furthermore, within the South region is a cluster clearly separate from the main 
cloud. How does this translate into a spatial paern and spatial continuity? e 
map in Figure 12.10 shows that, with the exception of Texas, all South Central 
states belong to this cluster, which also includes two states of the South Atlantic 
division: South Carolina and West Virginia.
When creating a scaer plot, it’s easy to overlook details in the distribution of 
each variable. To make sure this doesn’t happen, add marginal distributions along 
each axis. Figure 12.9 exempliﬁes this.

You’re not restricted to a single line of best ﬁt for each scaer plot. You can deﬁne 
a meaningful group and analyze it, while not forgeing that you can’t generalize 
insights from the group to the whole population. A “meaningful group” also means

that you can’t go cherry-picking the data points that validate your message. In 
Figure 12.11, each region gets its own line of best ﬁt, and it’s easy to see that the 
South (blue dots) follows the line of best ﬁt much closer than the West (the red 
dots), which is much more diverse. Overall, the relationship is much stronger 
in the South than in any other region, although we should question whether we 
have enough data points in each region to draw meaningful conclusions.
You can also analyze multiple variables, such as in Figure 12.12, where it is clear 
that inactivity and hypertension have a similarly strong relationship with dia-
betes, and that obesity has a much weaker relationship.

right of the 45º reference line, which means that it exports much more than it 
imports. is is inﬂuenced by sales of Machinery, with a share of exports of 
38 percent. Compare this with Minerals, where exports are half of imports. e

is technique of displaying country proﬁles can be seen (in a more complex, inter-
active, and aesthetically pleasing display) in the Beer Life Index (Figure 12.14) 
from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Each 
ﬂower represents a country, its height represents the index, and each petal’s 
height encodes the score for each item in the index. Users can emphasize or 
deemphasize item relevancy by changing each petal’s width.

Bubble Charts
ink of the bubble chart as a scaer plot in which the size of the dots (bubbles) 
encodes a quantitative variable. In addition, because the area is larger, it’s pos-
sible to use color to add a fourth quantitative or qualitative variable.
We discussed Stevens’ power law in Chapter 2. It tells us that we underestimate 
larger areas and overestimate smaller areas. When applied to bubble charts, this 
means that we can’t accurately compare the areas of the bubbles. But the bubble 
chart has a strange feature: It combines this low-precision retinal variable (area) 
with perceptually precise retinal variables (x and y positions).
Don’t dismiss bubble charts because we can’t accurately read and compare bubbles. 
Instead, think of a bubble chart as a scaer plot to which you added interesting, 
but not critical, data. We must accept (but be aware of) some level of inaccu-
racy when comparing bubbles if we can beneﬁt from the additional insights. 
Otherwise, we should consider other visualization options.
e bubble chart in Figure 12.15 is a redraw of Figure 12.9, where bubble sizes 
encode total population. For improved accuracy, the point that happens to match 
the bubble center was maintained. You can read the chart like you’d read a 
scaer plot, but now you also know, for example, that three of the larger states 
are relatively close together.

If you watched Hans Rosling’s talks (as described in Chapters 2 and 11), Figure 12.16 
will look familiar. is Gapminder chart plots two development indicators (life 
expectancy and gross domestic product per capita) and uses bubble size to encode 
population and bubble color to encode region. In this chart, we don’t really care 
about how big China and India are. e major insights are the strong correlation 
between gross domestic product and life expectancy and the distribution of the 
countries along this line, with African countries at the boom le and European 
countries at the top right. It’s nice to have population, but basically it only con-
tributes to making the chart preier.
Check the section Size by Population in the legend. It’s hard to believe that the 
1000 million bubble is ten times larger than the 100 million bubble, conﬁrming 
Stevens’ law and our inaccurate assessment of areas.
Because each data point uses a larger area, the bubble chart allows for fewer 
points than a scaer plot, and the probability of overlapping data points is also 
much higher. In Gapminder’s chart, it’s clear that the designer worked hard to 
ensure that only smaller bubbles could overlap larger ones, so that all remained 
visible. In Figure 12.15, I used a high percentage of transparency to make sure all 
bubbles are visible.

Note that a bubble chart always contains at least three meaningful variables 
(x, y, and bubble size) and should not be confused with what I like to call a helium 
chart, as schematically represented in Figure 12.17. We can assume that, for all 
relevant purposes, the helium chart lacks the variables x and y because they are 
not linked to the data table.
Figure 12.17 The helium chart.
e helium chart is oen an interactive chart in which you can toss the bubbles 
around. is is fun but rarely useful or insightful. Because the only relevant vari-
able is bubble size, a helium chart is really just another bar chart, but without 
the level of accurate reading we can expect from a bar chart.

Takeaways
 
I
Relationship charts provide the highest level of data integration, showing 
the true shape of the variation when two variables are ploed one against 
the other.
 
I
Your goal should always be to reduce the noise until the basic structure of 
the relationship becomes apparent. Play with Excel’s options for the line 
of best ﬁt, but don’t over-ﬁt.
 
I
Complement what you see with statistical metrics such as the correlation 
coeﬃcient.
 
I
Characterize the variables’ relationship in terms of direction, shape, and 
strength.
 
I
Never forget that correlation doesn’t imply causation. Even when we are 
aware of doing so, it’s easy to describe the data with an implicit cause and 
eﬀect relationship.
 
I
When you use the same units of measurement for both axes in a scaer 
plot, also apply the same range and make the chart square. en zoom in 
and select the relevant section, maintaining the correct proportions.
 
I
Use reference lines such as the 45º line as annotations for a more precise 
reading.
 
I
When using bubble charts, emphasize position and use bubble size for a 
less relevant variable.
 
I
Don’t use helium charts, whose only relevant variable (prone to inaccurate 
reading) is size.

PROFILING
To introduce the topic of this chapter, let me ﬁrst show you a visual 
display that will help you realize the signiﬁcance of proﬁling: a chart 
with a lot of data points that could beneﬁt from a structure to process 
a large amount of data. e graphical table in Figure 13.1 represents 
the estimated percentage of people in each single-year age group 
(0 to 100 years old and more) in each of the 3,141 U.S. counties. Row 
height encodes population size for that county. Counties were sorted 
by median age. Higher proportions are encoded in red, while lower 
proportions are encoded in gray.

is visualization contains hundreds of thousands of data points. If I used Italian 
comuni, instead of U.S. counties, I would end up with a table with more than 
half a million data points. So visualizing a large number of data points in Excel 
is possible, and even useful for revealing paerns that might otherwise remain 
hidden. is is not Big Data,¹ but it is clearly bigger than the data sets used less 
than 250 years ago, when most charts used today were invented.
e point with this display is that, although more data is not necessarily beer
data, low-data-density Excel charts are oen the norm, because low-density charts 
are also easier to make and read. At this level, it’s useful to constantly ask “What 
data can I add?” “How will additional data improve the analysis?” and “How can 
I design the chart for more data?”
Perhaps in a few years’ time, immersive technologies will turn current chart 
types into the silent movies of data visualization. While we wait for the future 
to arrive (or until a new marketing fad replaces Big Data), it’s worth thinking 
of ways to add more data and extend the lifespan of the chart types we have 
today. If you think about it, many of the ideas discussed in the book will have 
that side eﬀect.
One way of adding more detail to a chart is by creating proﬁles. Proﬁling is the 
representation of entities by creating an array of similar charts in which there 
are two readings: a reading of each individual proﬁle and a comparison reading 
with other proﬁles. e integration and interdependence of these charts should 
lead us to consider them as a whole—as a single chart rather than as separate 
charts. We’ve already seen an example of a proﬁling chart: the scaer plot matrix 
in Figure 12.4. We’ll explore other types of proﬁling charts over the next pages.
1 Remember that Big Data is, in a humorous but not too accurate deﬁnition, “Anything that won’t 
ﬁt in Excel.”

The Need to Solve
We are now facing an interesting conundrum. On the one hand, the average number 
of data points per chart has to grow, because the data and their relationships are 
more complex, and higher graphical literacy means more sophisticated visual-
izations of larger data sets.² On the other hand, the audience may not appreciate 
having to deal with a visualization that goes beyond their aention span.
If we simply add more data to the charts found in the Excel library, we’ll end up 
with undetectable paerns within spaghei line charts or a chaotic forest of 
bar charts. We must impose a structure that minimizes cognitive load so that 
the audience can eﬀortlessly process a larger volume of data. Proﬁling is one of 
the solutions. 
Over time, various forms of proﬁling have been proposed with diﬀerent designa-
tions: scaer plot matrices, panel charts, reorderable matrices, and small multiples. 
ere are diﬀerent nuances among these concepts, but they’re all rooted in the 
same essential principle of juxtaposing multiple entities and making comparisons 
based on the same criteria.
One of the features of proﬁling charts is that individual chart position is not 
arbitrary; it must be deduced from the data whenever possible. is is particularly 
explicit in the reorderable matrix, in which either the points are ordered along a 
quantitative axis or the juxtaposition criteria obey some rules, as discussed below.
Panel Charts
e National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) is a U.S. organization dedicated 
to the study of the cryosphere, the frozen regions of our planet. One of its activi-
ties is to monitor the sea ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic regions. In one of 
their web pages, you can play with the interactive chart shown in Figure 13.2, 
visualising the extent of sea ice through the years since 1979. What insights can 
we get from this chart? Basically, that there is more ice in the winter than in the 
summer, and there are variations from year to year. at’s relatively lile insight 
for such a noble task.
2 Having to deal with a data set just an order of magnitude larger could make Excel users aware of 
the need for beer visualization and data management skills.

When used with all the data, this is the typical spaghei chart that tells us nothing, 
apart from the obvious seasonality. e problem, as you’ve already guessed, lies 
in the useless comparisons between months, when the right way to analyze the 
data is to proﬁle each month over time in a cycle plot, just like we did in Chapter 6 
with the monthly live births. e charts in Figure 13.3 also show seasonality, 
but they go far beyond that: ey reveal a serious decrease in sea ice extent in 
the Arctic over time. ey also show that variation in each month is higher in the 
Antarctic but variation is increasing in summer months in the Arctic.
Figure 13.2 This chart shows the obvious seasonality but uselessly compares months.

Seasonality is just one of many factors that impede traditional line charts from 
providing insights eﬀectively. In this case, as in others, proﬁling is the solution 
to visually organize and get insights from larger tables. Proﬁling shows the data, 
not in a single chart but in juxtaposed panels (proﬁles). is creates individual 
representations that can be studied case by case, as well as proﬁles comparable as 
a whole. Even if you focus on the month proﬁle, you can still observe the seasonal 
data evolution.

Bar Charts with Multiple Series
e grouped bar chart in Figure 13.4 displays the proﬁle of several household 
types regarding expenditures. I don’t want you to compare individual expenditure 
categories across multiple household types, so I added vertical gridlines to raise 
perceptual barriers between them. e implicit suggestion is that you should 
make comparisons inside each household type or compare between household 
expenditure proﬁles. If you want to emphasize expenditure categories, you may 
want to switch the data table and group by category rather than by household 
type. e chart is not very eﬀective, though. ere are too many categories, and 
except for Housing, proﬁles seem very similar. Proﬁling assumes that there are 
suﬃcient diﬀerences between proﬁles to justify visualizing them.

e new version, in Figure 13.5, addresses these issues, starting by aggregating 
expenditure categories into broader groups that make sense to the author and, 
hopefully, to the audience. en, reference points make it easy to compare the 
item with the overall expenditure structure. Now the gaps are much more obvious.

Horizon Chart
Only a fraction of the top chart real estate in Figure 13.6 is actually used to display 
data. Perhaps we could do something about this, because the more compact your 
display is, the more data you can add. For example, since a variable can have posi-
tive and negative values, but not at the same time, there’s always wasted space 
in the other side of the axis. We could “fold” it, assuming that the vertical axis 
represents an absolute scale, and use color to encode sign (red = above, blue = 
below). e middle chart in Figure 13.6 shows the result. We just have to switch 
gears and read the variable as having two states. is isn’t too diﬃcult, and noth-
ing is lost from the previous version.

What if we take this a step further and create a diverging color scale to signal 
levels of variation, as we did in the middle chart of Figure 13.6? en, nothing 
prevents us from collapsing the axis so that only the top class for each data point 
remains visible. We can use color to deduce into which class the point falls. e 
result is the boom chart of Figure 13.6. Jeﬀrey Heer et al. named this design the 
“horizon chart” and deﬁned its speciﬁcations.³
I won’t tell you that no perceptual precision is lost. It is. at’s inevitable when 
you use color to encode quantitative data. Folding the axis is also a strange concept 
that takes some time to get used to.

is looks like too much work for its dubious return, but I don’t think the authors 
of the horizon chart wanted to go this far just to end up with a long stripe of 
colored bands. Where the horizon chart really shines is when you treat it as a 
proﬁling chart. In Figure 13.7, you get 52 proﬁles of unemployment by state for a 
whopping 473 months. Much happened in nearly 40 years, and you can discover 
it here. Regardless of the national unemployment rate, some states will consis-
tently be above it.
If you wanted to display the same data using regular area charts, you would get a 
chart seven times taller and spread over multiple screens or pages. Its compact-
ness is what makes the horizon chart so great: You get a lot of detail, but at the 
same time you can zoom out and get the overall picture.

Reorderable Matrix
In the top display in Figure 13.8, a set of entities (places) identiﬁed by leers is 
associated with a set of characteristics. It’s not easy to draw any conclusions from 
the display, as neither features nor entities are sorted to help create a recogniz-
able paern. In the second version, on the boom, we have ordered both lines 
and columns, and have discovered that certain characteristics are associated 
with certain types of entities. From these associations, we can identify three 
levels of human selements. A simple table sorting allowed us to ﬁnd paerns 
that would otherwise remain hidden. e existence of one or more diagonals is 
a typical result of a reorderable matrix.

is is an example of Jacques Bertin’s reorderable matrix, purposely simple and 
designed by himself. With real data, paerns may be less clear, be less easy to 
spot, or have multiple solutions.⁴
Inspired by the reorderable matrix, the chart in Figure 13.9 shows the U.S. retailer 
Walmart’s store growth between 1962 and 2006. States were ranked by opening 
date and number of stores, and colored according to their U.S. Census region. 
Combining the sort and color reveals several interesting details, including the 
gradual Walmart entry into every state of the South and Midwest, intense store 
openings throughout the 1980s, and sudden expansion into the Northeast and 
West since 1990, making it a truly national chain. Unlike the preceding matrix 
example, in this case only the states can be sorted because the horizontal axis is 
a time series.
e reorderable matrix demonstrates the importance of ﬁnding the right sorting 
key for data. As we’ve seen, this is valid for any type of graphical representation. 
In simple charts, there is a proper sort key. With proﬁling charts, there is no 
single key to the diagonals. We might need to manually adjust each of the rows 
and columns to obtain the appropriate grouping.
4 In the 1960s, reordering matrices was done manually with cards, but now you can play with an 
interactive version online.

Small Multiples
Edward Tue coined the expression “small multiples.” Like other proﬁling charts, 
a small multiples chart consists of a grid layout where entities share the same 
display rules. Any chart can be used in a matrix of small multiples, although using 
pie charts is guaranteed to yield great loathing from Tue.
One of the most interesting uses of small multiples is as an alternative to anima-
tion. In this case, each multiple functions as a frame of a movie, allowing us to 
study each frame and make pair-wise comparisons.
In Figure 13.10, a U.S. map is used to again show Walmart store openings. Ordering 
is obvious, since it’s a time series. Each year represents existing stores and those 
that have opened that same year. e gray dots in the background represent the 
location of each county of the United States.
e reorderable matrix and small multiples complement each other nicely. Notice 
on the small multiples map how the store network has spread like a virus from a 
central point, while it’s easier to observe entrance and coverage proﬁles in each 
state in the reorderable matrix.
Using exactly the same data, we’re able to prove what has been emphasized 
throughout this book—namely, that there are many ways to extract knowledge 
from a table, and we must search for them using a multitude of visualization types.

Proﬁling in Excel
In Excel, you can select a data range and drop it into a chart object, and it will be 
added as a new series. It would be great if you could drop a categorical data range 
and automatically split the chart into small multiples. But you can’t.
When working on proﬁling charts, ﬁrst build an initial chart that will serve as 
a model. Do your best to ensure that this will be your ﬁnal design. Ensure that 
the scales cover the maximum and minimum values of the entire table, and set 
them to manual mode so that they don’t change when you change categories. 
When you have your ﬁnal version, save it as a template and use it to make the 
remaining charts in the set.
With a data visualization tool other than Excel, creating proﬁling charts is as 
easy as dragging a variable to the appropriate ﬁeld. When there are many vari-
ables with potential for segmentation, this is an invaluable aid. is is one of the 
features whose absence in Excel exasperates me the most.⁵
Note that the maps presented in Figure 13.10 to exemplify small multiples are made 
of scaer plots where each point coordinate is a geographical coordinate. e high 
number of points allows us to recognize the overall shape as the United States.
Since the position’s variables do not encode values beyond the geographical loca-
tions of the point, an alternative is to create multiple series, each color-coded. 
For these Excel maps, three series were used: counties in gray, existing stores in 
orange, and new stores in blue.
5 e good news is that this has been addressed by Microso in Power BI. You may want to try it if 
you have a recurrent need.

Takeaways
 
I
e more data points you add to a chart, the higher the risk of hiding pat-
terns. When you split a chart into multiple proﬁles, you get a more struc-
tured display that is easier to read and interpret.
 
I
In a proﬁle chart, all proﬁles share the same design, especially the aspect 
ratio and the scales, to make them comparable.
 
I
In general, reading each proﬁle should be as easy as reading the full-size 
original chart type, but when you perform pair-wise comparisons it’s harder 
to spot smaller diﬀerences. Adding reference points simpliﬁes this task.
 
I
Sort the proﬁles such that you’re able to see the overall paern.
 
I
Oen you can use small multiples instead of animation. Check the pros 
and cons of each option for each speciﬁc visualization.
 
I
Proﬁling means that you split the data set into as many proﬁles as the number 
of categories in the proﬁler variable (year, state, month, etc.). Explore the 
data by testing multiple proﬁler variables, if the tool you’re using allows 
you to do so without too much eﬀort.

DESIGNING FOR 
EFFECTIVENESS
It’s easy to agree on what “eﬀectiveness” means, but ﬁnding a con-
sensus on how to measure it is much harder. Eﬀectiveness doesn’t 
exist on its own; there is “eﬀectiveness to whom” (where who deﬁnes 
the parameters) and “eﬀectiveness regarding what” (the task).
In data visualization, the word “eﬀectiveness” is thrown around a 
lot, so let’s try to understand its scope. First, imagine yourself in 
the role of:
I A scientist, sharing with fellow scientists the results of your 
team’s latest experiment on vaccine safety.
I A policy maker, trying to change the behavior of reluctant 
mothers regarding vaccine safety.
I An artist, creating a beautiful piece of data art that raises 
awareness of the issue of unvaccinated children.

14 I DESIGNING FOR EFFECTIVENESS
313
Now imagine that you need to create eﬀective visualizations for each. In this 
scenario, you’ll reuse some of the data in all three roles, but everything else is 
diﬀerent: information asymmetry, tasks, goals, and audience aention span. You 
simply can’t use the same visuals and send the same message. You realize this 
and design three diﬀerent visuals accordingly. You are certain that each one will 
tackle the task very eﬀectively.
But wait. Suppose something goes terribly wrong in this perfect scenario. Your 
daily agenda somehow got completely mixed up and you deliver the wrong pre-
sentation in each meeting: You tried to change the behavior of your audience 
at the art gallery, who were there to see art, not an infographic about how safe 
vaccines are; you shared your piece of art with your team, who instead wanted 
to see hard statistics and complex charts; and you discussed the results of your 
experiment with the reluctant mothers, who had no idea what those scaer plots 
and regression analysis were all about. In this case, your visuals were actually so 
ineﬀective that you ended up inciting an angry mob. Your perfectly craed mes-
sages were the right ones for the originally intended audience, but the moment 
they were mixed up and you delivered the wrong presentation in each meeting, 
all their eﬀectiveness was lost. 
To prevent this kind of disaster, always double-check that you’re presenting the 
right visuals to the right audience.
e point is, eﬀectiveness in data visualization is task-dependent and design-
dependent (not to mention data-dependent). You have to create a visualization 
that addresses the issue, and you must design it in a way that generates a mean-
ingful communication for your select audience. Some people will tell you that 
“insights” is the metric you should use to evaluate its eﬀectiveness. Others will 
insist that “engagement” is the right metric, and you achieve that by preifying 
your visualizations. is leads to aesthetics.
e role and importance of aesthetics deﬁne one of the major lines separating data 
visualization practitioners. On one hand, we have a huge group of anonymous 
practitioners who use common soware tools such as Excel and PowerPoint in 
their daily data-related tasks within organizations. On the other hand, info-
graphics created by graphic designers have a growing presence in the media. 
Also, organizations have found in infographics a way to increase the audience 
for their websites. Neither of these two groups is uniform, but the distinction 
between them is clear.

DATA AT WORK
314
Since graphic designers’ visualizations are more visible and more aesthetically 
appealing, it’s natural that they serve as a model to common organizational 
practitioners. is aesthetic appeal is leveraged by soware application vendors 
who promise artistic accomplishment through the use of their canned eﬀects.
When graphic literacy in the organization is low, these are seductive arguments, 
especially because alternative models to suit the organization’s needs are non-
existent, unknown to them, or labeled “boring.”
Many journalists and infographics designers ﬁght against stylistic excesses 
that result in an inability to understand the visualizations’ content. Alberto 
Cairo, a journalist and lead author writing about data visualization for the media, 
says in his book e Functional Art that “[G]raphics, charts, and maps aren’t just 
tools to be seen, but to be read and scrutinized. e ﬁrst goal of an infographic is 
not to be beautiful just for the sake of eye appeal, but, above all, to be under-
standable ﬁrst, and beautiful aer that; or to be beautiful thanks to its exquisite 
functionality.”¹ Cairo does not minimize the importance of aesthetics, but he 
subordinates aesthetics to the functional reading and understanding of graphical 
representations, even in infographics, an area in which consumers expect greater 
creative freedom.
Data visualization in organizations follows a speciﬁc model (business visualiza-
tion), and the adoption of inappropriate models negatively impacts the value we 
can extract from the data. Adhering to basic visualization principles discussed 
throughout this book not only helps you create more eﬀective graphical represen-
tations, but also builds a safety net in the organization that helps avoid aesthetic 
calamities such as the pie charts presented in the ﬁrst chapter.
ere are no charts without aesthetics, however. Aesthetics create an emotional 
response that translates into rejection, indiﬀerence, or continued aention. Our 
aim is to always capture aention and interest in learning more, because this is 
the only way to help the audience acquire knowledge.

The Aesthetic Dimension
Many of the charts in Figure 14.1 are real, by which I mean they’re charts that 
someone has used in their analysis and communication. In most of them, we do not 
intuit any particular artistic talent of its author, not even some basic graphic design 
skills, but rather just the use of the ﬂashiest options available in the application.
When artistic talent is scarce, common sense would suggest adopting a more 
conservative and neutral aitude. Judging from the number of 3D eﬀects, bright 
colors, and exploded pie slices, we might be tempted to conclude the opposite. At 
least the authors are aware of the importance of the aesthetic dimension.

Bad designs result from a lack of skills, customer and peer pressure, and a unique 
aesthetic sense supported by canned eﬀects available in soware applications. 
e consequences are visible on the search results page. But artistic talent is not 
a necessary condition for making good charts. If your daily tasks are analyzing 
your organization’s data, design skills are not a requirement.
It is no coincidence that we only began data visualization in Chapter 5 of this book, 
aer having discussed perception, context, and data preparation. While aesthet-
ics are discussed in this chapter, this structure aims to highlight the functional 
component of visualization and reduce the pressure for allegedly needed artistic 
talent or, even worse, the unrestrained use of special eﬀects.
A Wrong Model
If, instead of “charts and graphs,” we search for “data visualization,” we get results 
dominated by graphic design, as exempliﬁed by Figure 14.2. Many of the images 
are unique and aention-grabbing, and some are pure poetry.
Comparing both search results shows the immense distance between the canned 
eﬀects of “memorable” charts and the true talent of many designers. But I’m not 
trying to demonstrate the aesthetic deprivation of the former search results. We 
have a more important goal, which is to evaluate whether the data visualization 
model of the laer is relevant to us. Here are some evaluation criteria:
 
I
Can they be made in an organizational environment? Being unique 
objects, these visualizations do not ﬁt the production processes that are 
expected of a sales or marketing department; they are best suited for the 
creative process of a design studio or a media outlet.
 
I
Are they eﬀective? ey are no doubt beautiful and eﬀective in drawing the 
aention of the audience, but many of them pose serious reading problems, 
either for point comparison or for paern detection.
 
I
Are they consistent and recognizable? Any chart type requires a learning 
period, but a production environment is not compatible with a continuous 
visual innovation that requires constant relearning of the process.
 
I
Are they adapted to oﬃce tools? ese visualizations are produced using 
speciﬁc programming languages and applications such as Adobe Illustra-
tor—tools that are not generally available to typical oﬃce users.
 
I
Are they aligned with oﬃce users’ skills? ese visualizations emphasize 
graphic design skills and artistic talent, which in general are not expected 
or required for data analysis positions in an organization.

The Design Continuum
It’s not hard to conclude from the answers to the questions above that data visu-
alization as practiced by graphic designers isn’t compatible with the day-to-day 
needs of organizations. Although appealing, it can’t serve as a role model for 
business visualization. But design is inevitable from the moment when points 
are mapped. How can we integrate design more explicitly in the organizational 
routine? To understand it, we must recognize that the nature of design changes 
along a continuum whose characteristics are represented in Figure 14.3.
 
I
Encoding. In the ﬁrst phase, the design task is to encode the data using a 
set of transformations that create a recognizable chart, with which we’ve 
likely had prior experience and which we know how to read and interpret. 
is is the passage of the proto-chart to the chart, as discussed in Chapter 1.
 
I
Function. e functional stage takes into account the situation (task type, 
audience proﬁle, and other context variables) and represents the most 
rational way to optimize the message, by taking advantage of the rules of 
perception, for example.
 
I
Makeup. At this stage in the continuum, the criterion is no longer eﬀec-
tiveness at all costs but the creation of an emotional reaction that arouses 
aention and promotes the interest of the audience for the message you 
want to convey.
 
I
Decoration. Excessive makeup, distortions, or the introduction of elements 
irrelevant to chart reading bring about this stage. e display becomes 
narcissistic and more concerned with its own aesthetic eﬀect than with 
eﬀective communication.
Talented graphic designers stay within the makeup stage, creating visualizations 
that tend to be both informative and engaging, while decoration is mostly found 
in pseudo-3D Excel charts and many bad infographics. Decoration is the wrong 
goal, but its relationship with aesthetics can trigger a transformation and become 
art. In data art, the data are merely the starting point for the development of an 
artistic expression with the goal of oﬀering an emotional experience.

Tools Are Not Neutral: Defaults
Have you heard the fable about the scorpion and the frog? e scorpion asks the 
frog to help it cross the river. When the frog refuses for fear it will be stung, the 
scorpion reasons it would never sting the frog because both would then die. e 
scorpion eventually persuades the frog but then stings the frog in the middle of the 
river crossing, dooming them both. Before dying, the frog asks why the scorpion 
stung him, to which the scorpion responds, “It is in my nature.”
Every tool also has “its nature:” its default seings, its purpose, and the way the 
vendor understands the needs to be addressed. Diﬀerent tools lead to diﬀerent 
results for the same task. Edward Tue wrote a famous essay² in which he says 
that PowerPoint favors a type of linear presentation and an unpleasant sales 
pitch: “PowerPoint presentations oen look like a high school drama: very loud, 
very slow, very simple.” is can trigger an interesting discussion. e vendor 
likes to claim that misuse or poor use is not the application’s fault but instead is 
the fault of the tool user. is, however, hides a lot of the truth.
en we have the additional issue regarding application defaults; they’re a balm 
for users, because they save time, avoid the anxiety of multiple choices, and give 
the illusion of skills that do not exist. Moreover, it’s easy to believe that the vendor 
has chosen the best options.
Excel proves that this is far from reality. 
We can’t deny that the defaults have improved since the ugly Excel 2003. e 
purple bar on gray background is gone, as is the silly legend used for a single 
series. But much remains to be done. All of Excel’s predeﬁned designs cater to 
the user’s sense of aesthetics, and not a single one suggests a more functional ap-
proach to the design. Here are just a few examples of bad defaults for bar charts:
 
I
Bar charts can have far too many grid lines, because the algorithm is more 
interested in ﬁnding round numbers. Seing the default limit to three in 
order to split the plot area into four sections would be an improvement.
 
I
e default gap width between bars is set to an obscure 219 percent. Seing 
it at 100 percent would be more sensible.
 
I
Once variation falls below a predeﬁned threshold (around 20 percent), Excel 
will break the vertical scale. is can’t be the default behavior for bar charts.

If you want to follow Stephen Few’s or Edward Tue’s data visualization recom-
mendations while using a tool like Excel, you will constantly ﬁght against the 
majority of chart types and their default seings.
Reason and Emotion
How experts deﬁne data visualization is almost as personal as their ﬁngerprints. 
Most deﬁnitions can be easily placed in a section of the design continuum, which 
best discriminates the many varying perspectives.
e design continuum is not just about aesthetics. e continuum also reﬂects 
the relative weights of reason and emotion on a graphical representation. e 
conﬂict between reason and emotion is one of the constants of the human con-
dition, and it doesn’t seem likely that scientiﬁc and technological advances will 
ever substantially change the relationship between them. It seems much simpler 
to capture aention through emotion—because it’s more immediate—than to 
capture aention through reason—which requires greater investment.
Data visualization does not escape this confrontation. Graphic illiteracy leads to 
a preference for simple charts with few data points that recreate physical objects, 
to which are added very obvious stylistic “wow” eﬀects. Increased literacy does 
not eliminate emotional components but leads to subtler preferences that seek 
to integrate emotion into visualization.
A.I.D.A.
A.I.D.A. is an old marketing acronym that models expected behaviors toward an 
advertising message. e initial objective is of course to aract potential con-
sumer’s Aention, because this is the necessary step to evoke Interest, which 
may become the Desire for the product, which leads to a purchase Action.
ese four steps are important, and message eﬀectiveness is measured by the 
ﬁnal result, the sales volume, but nothing is possible without the ﬁrst A—the 
foot in the door that establishes a communication channel. e larger the number 
of messages to which we are subjected, the more advertisers seek some form of 
diﬀerentiation that makes their message stand out.

DATA AT WORK
322
Now, because most of the time you’re not actually selling a product or service 
when you share a chart with an audience, let’s adapt the model:
I
Aention. A visualization stands out on a page and aracts our aention.
I
Interest. A quick scan and evaluation of visual objects, and perhaps read-
ing titles, helps us decide whether this is interesting.
 
I
Desire. We now want (desire) to read the visualization in full and capture 
whatever message it communicates.
I
Action. As managers, we can actually take action based on what the data tell 
us. As magazine readers, we might take the action of ceasing to purchase 
certain products or simply becoming aware of a social issue.
In business visualization, the resources available for representing data are sparse. 
ere are only a handful of chart types (although they have multiple variations). 
For many infographics authors, making a bar chart is almost a sacrilege, because 
that represents an immediate transformation of Aention into Boredom. For 
others, the key focus is on the data only. Edward Tue, for example, says that “if 
the statistics are boring, you chose the wrong numbers.”
We ﬁnd levels of reason and emotion on four elements of a chart: in the data them-
selves, in the visual variable that encodes them, in the title, and in the background.
Compare the charts in Figure 14.4 and Figure 14.5. It’s the same chart type dis-
playing the same data, but a world of emotions separates them.
Both charts represent the annual evolution since 1960 of live births in Portugal, 
one of the countries in the world with the lowest fertility rates. In the ﬁrst version, 
only in the data do we ﬁnd some emotion, due to the signiﬁcant reduction in live 
births. is ﬁrst version seeks to be correct, neutral, and descriptive, or in one 
word, rational. e designer believes that the reader will know how to incorporate 
the chart into his or her overall knowledge on the subject. It’s a chart formaed 
to complement an accompanying text that one is already reading. Few readers 
will be aracted to the text aer seeing the chart. It is common to ﬁnd this kind 
of chart in a report or in an oﬃcial statistics agency publication.

e second version is much diﬀerent. is chart does not include any additional 
quantitative information to make us beer understand what’s happening, and 
yet it draws our aention and evokes our interest. If this were the initial pages 
of an article in a magazine, it’s likely that it would have incited us to read it to 
learn more. is is because we feel that it’s talking about a real drama, not just 
showing a few statistics. Let’s see how this is done:
I
Data. Like the skyrocketing unemployment rate in Greece, the sharply 
plummeting trend is so “in-your-face” that it tells the whole story.
 
I
Line. e chart line is the only color element, so it aracts aention. e 
use of red gives us a clue that it is not good news (a blue line would soen 
the message).
 
I
Title. e title is not descriptive; it makes a comment that is complemented 
by the text below. Formulating a question, it suggests that the reader will 
ﬁnd the answer in the article.
 
I
Background. e dark background, with an empty playground picture, 
bridges the gap between data and reality.
I added a few questionable details to enhance the dramatic eﬀect, as the subtle 
continuity between the series and the object in the background image makes it 
look like the line is tending toward zero. e much larger size of the image also 
gives this chart an emphasis that the previous version does not.
ese details don’t alter the message in the data, but you must be aware of the 
dangers you face when entering this emotional dimension. You’ll typically know 
when you’ve gone too far, but one example is to avoid depicting people in the 
picture, as they evoke too much undeﬁned emotion.
Does Reason Follow Emotion?
With the clear, simple, and immediate message in the chart from Figure 14.5, we 
set the emotional tone. From a rational perspective, it would make sense to add 
more data, such as comparing Portugal to the European Union. But should we do 
this in this chart? e chart tells us that there is a signiﬁcant drop in live births 
in Portugal, and the text tells us that this will have dramatic consequences. is 
is the scenario that we have set up. From here on, we’ll build our story with more 
data and cleaner charts.

e chart in Figure 14.6 shows that Portugal is diverging quite a lot from the 
European Union, with continuous drops in live births throughout the twenty-ﬁrst 
century. is means that the scenario is very serious, both in absolute terms and 
in comparison with the EU.

e chart in Figure 14.7 would also be a good candidate for an emotional approach. 
It shows us that, because the fertility rate is below 2.1 children per woman (the 
minimum needed to replace generations), there is a scarcity of more than one 
million children since 1990, an average of over 50,000 per year. is is a very high 
number for a country the size of North Carolina.
Because the chart in Figure 14.5 has established the central idea and set the 
emotional framework, none of the remaining fertility rate charts need to have 
that same dramatic eﬀect. e other charts enrich the story in a subordinated 
manner and without conﬂict with the central chart, like our planetary system 
orbiting the sun.

Emotion and Eﬀectiveness
Some studies show that an aesthetic evaluation of an object aﬀects the perception 
of its functionality, so neglecting this dimension and any other form of emotion 
when reading a chart proves to be a mistake. e question is therefore whether 
we should continue to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of a chart strictly by functional 
criteria, or if instead emotional components should be taken into account and 
exploited to aract the audience’s interest.
ere is no universal answer. One reason for this is that the interpretation of func-
tional criteria and emotional components diﬀer between the time of analysis and 
the time of communication (we don’t make 3D pie charts for personal consumption).
e second reason relates to the asymmetry between the information producer 
and the consumer. e larger the asymmetry, the more likely it is that the producer 
will prefer an emotional representation, as in the case of infographics in media. 
In business organizations, however, information sharing starts from a more bal-
anced position and common interests that minimize the need to aract aention.

It’s also most likely that people will remember an unusual and emotional graphi-
cal representation when compared to another one they have seen a million times 
before. Although this is a goal sought by infographics, memorable and emotionally 
appealing charts are generally not necessary or relevant in a business organization, 
even though they may be used at times when the organization as a whole must 
be made more aware of something or when personnel need speciﬁc motivation.
Note that there is a decline in communication eﬀectiveness associated with a 
monotonous constant repetition of the same graphical model, whether it’s that 
of pure rationality or the emotional memory. One introduces boredom; the other 
produces desensitization and requires increasing doses of emotion to maintain 
the same level of audience response.
Occam’s Razor
If the aesthetics suggested by the “data visualization” search results presented 
earlier in this chapter are not suitable for everyday data visualization in an orga-
nizational environment, what’s the alternative?
In the fourteenth century, the Franciscan monk William of Occam (or William of 
Ockham) formulated a principle that came to be known as Occam’s razor, which 
states that “plurality is not to be assumed without necessity.” at is, we should 
always prefer simple hypotheses or explanations over the more complex, as the 
introduction of complexity must result from necessity. Invoking parsimony and 
simplicity to explain reality is a common theme of many philosophers, artists, 
and scientists over the centuries, from Aristotle’s writings to the more prosaic 
KISS (Keep it simple, stupid).
It’s important to note that parsimony and simplicity are not absolute principles. 
We should not take them to the extreme and risk losing useful elements for 
understanding. is is implied in Occam’s razor and is explicit in the famous 
Einstein quote: “We should make things simple, but not simpler.” Also, you 
shouldn’t assume that “simplifying” equates to “removing things”: You do have 
to eliminate the irrelevant, but that’s the starting point that should be followed 
by minimizing the accessory, ﬁxing the necessary, and adding the useful. is 
metaphorical razor proves valuable when it comes to Excel and visualizations in 
organizations, because much of the formaing work of an Excel chart consists 
of deleting useless objects and ﬁxing a lot of details.

Let’s now observe Occam’s razor in action, as applied to a chart in which we have 
added only a clip-art image using the default seings of Excel 2003.
e charts in Figure 14.8 represent the evolution of annual per capita avail-
ability of meat from various sources, in the United States, over a century. We’re 
interested in the evolution of beef and chicken availability in particular. (In case 
you’re wondering: According to my research, no single factor explains the abrupt 
reversal of the trend in beef consumption aer 1976. Health concerns are oen 
cited, but an article in California Agriculture suggests that a widening gap between 
beef and chicken price indexes, coupled with lower consumer purchasing power, 
played a major role in this shi.)
Figure 14.8 shows the original chart along with the modiﬁed chart aer applying 
Occam’s razor. e line chart is the right chart for representing the data. Let’s 
discover how functional design options render the chart most eﬀective and most 
appealing.
I
Eliminate the irrelevant. Initially, our intervention is subtractive, remov-
ing excess and bringing out the nature of the data. To cite another familiar 
phrase, now is the time for “less is more.” Although the sharp decline in beef 
consumption makes the cow happy, this does not justify keeping the image 
of the smiling cow on the chart. e gray background, the borders, the leg-
end, the markers… all that must go, because they add no value whatsoever.
 
I
Minimize accessory objects. In the second phase, we can do a beer 
job with the axis. Removing the decimal places on the vertical axis, the 
four-digit years, and the excessive number of grid lines are examples of 
minimizing accessory objects.
I
Correct the necessary. In the third phase, we make corrections in the 
representation of the data itself, aligning it with the message. Some of the 
series are residual, and pork availability remains more or less ﬂat over the 
years. e more interesting analysis seems to be comparing beef to chicken. 
We’ll emphasize these two series, identify pork, and mute the others.
I
Add the useful. In the last phase, we add useful elements such as the 
maximum value in beef and a visual annotation highlighting a period of 
price increase that triggered the reversal in the trend. 
ese four phases show that removing cluer is indeed a necessary ﬁrst step, 
but this will not magically unveil hidden gems. It will only prepare the chart for 
the real work.

Before considering the task completed, make sure that this chart is aligned both 
with your message and with the overall communication. Don’t forget to check 
logistical issues, since the chart is now much lighter than the original (for example, 
will it look OK when projected?).
All of these changes result in a cleaner chart that is much more focused on the 
message we want to convey. While it is hard to forget the smiling cow from the 
ﬁrst version, the second version looks more professional in the true sense of the 
word. All changes have a rationale, keeping the chart functional and resulting in 
more elegant and proper aesthetics in the organizational context.
Except for a few annotations we could add, there isn’t much we can do to make 
this chart signiﬁcantly more functional. However, do we want to add an emotional 
tone? Perhaps we should start with a less insipid title. If we want to go even further 
and start changing the visual objects, things suddenly get a lot more slippery, 
and you will always lose functionality. If you don’t go overboard and the emotional 
dimension nicely complements or illustrates your message, you’ll get more aention 
and, hopefully, more interest. So this is a potential tradeoﬀ when you’re willing 
to lose some functionality, without signiﬁcantly impacting the message, in order 
to gain more aention and interest from the audience.
Designing Chart Components
Let’s go over some of the chart components and see how Occam’s razor and our 
generic design perspective apply.
Keep in mind that just as important as making good decisions with the chart’s 
formaing options is ensuring that they’re consistent throughout the presenta-
tion or report. When you create a chart, you also create rules, which the audience 
internalizes. If for no apparent reason you modify the rules, that will generate 
a disorienting eﬀect in the audience and a need to relearn what was once con-
sidered acquired.

14 I DESIGNING FOR EFFECTIVENESS
333
Inconsistency is not always bad, however; if it’s planned and it takes advantage 
of salience, it may reinforce a message that otherwise would go unnoticed. 
Inconsistencies take multiple forms and multiple levels, so I cannot be exhaus-
tive, but they occur:
I
At the detail level, when the same entity is coded with diﬀerent colors in 
two charts, or when using multiple fonts, or when several similar charts 
that should be compared have diﬀerent scales.
I
At the intermediate level, regarding the selected type of chart. If you’ve 
chosen a chart type to answer a certain question, don’t change the chart 
type if you have the same questions later, as when doing the same analysis 
for various products, regional levels, or socioeconomic groups.
 
I
At the top level of the process and in the overall representation structure. 
If the chosen option is a global analysis followed by ﬁltered data focused 
on one aspect, don’t confuse the audience with similar analyses but dif-
ferent structures.
Pseudo-3D
It’s impossible not to love impossible objects, like the Penrose triangle (Figure 14.9) 
and at the same time feel uncomfortable staring at them. It’s funny how if you ﬁxate 
on any point in the triangle it looks absolutely believable, but not the triangle 
as a whole. When art takes advantage of this, like in M.C. Escher’s lithographs, 
where a waterfall feeds on itself or stairs become endless loops, it looks so easy 
to make unique and memorable illustrations!
It would be really nice to have something like this in 
data visualization. Something to add to a visual display 
to make it unique, worthy of aention, and, as vendors 
like to proclaim, professional and memorable. (I’ve 
already told you “professional and memorable” is a pet 
peeve of mine.) Whatever it is, this je ne sais quoi must 
have an instantaneous eﬀect and be quick and easy to 
add, regardless of the author’s design skills. It must 
transform an abstract chart into a concrete image that 
resembles a day-to-day physical experience.

Well, there is something that exists, but would it be considered good news or 
not? is thing is called the pseudo-3D eﬀect. In most soware applications, it’s 
available as an option and it comes with what we might call an “Escher bonus,” 
or in other words, the inability to make sense of the position of objects in space. 
e Escher bonus is visible in Figure 14.10. e charts on the le have a default 
3D rotation, so they look bad without any other modiﬁcations. If you didn’t know 
that the value of the ﬁrst data point was 424, it could be anything, depending on 
the 3D rotation.

Figure 14.10 You can’t accurately compare bars and get the correct values from a 3D chart.
ese four charts show how useless grid lines are in a 3D chart. You can’t count 
on them to get a reliable reading. Your only option is to compare column heights. 
Aer all, there are no scale breaks, so that should be OK, right? Well, not so fast. 
I wouldn’t trust the boom right chart if I were you. You would need to check 
whether the proportions are correct, and you’ll have to be aware that your perception 
is compensating for distances. Because you can never be sure about the position 
of objects in space, any 3D chart fully deserves the Escher Career Achievement 
Award. And that is one award you don’t want as a chart maker.

acceptable graphical literacy. e forest of colorful pipes in Figure 14.11 is eﬀective

DATA AT WORK

Let’s examine the arguments against the use of pseudo-3D eﬀects in data visual-
ization. e use of pseudo-3D eﬀects: 
I
Distorts the relationship between objects. e distances between objects 
and their relative magnitude are poorly evaluated. In a pie chart, nearby 
segments seem larger than those farther away; in a bar chart, it’s hard to 
see which side of the bar serves as a reference and comparison with the 
grid lines, which are of no use.
I
Creates an erroneous communication concept. Some studies conclude 
that those individuals who make charts with pseudo-3D eﬀects do so not for 
personal consumption but only at the time of communication, believing that 
this will have a positive impact on the audience’s aention and memory. As 
we have seen earlier, surprising the audience with a design is something 
that makes sense in the media but does not ﬁt the production process of 
business organizations, where hundreds of charts are made every day.
I
Extinguishes the surprise eﬀect. Special canned eﬀects, such as those 
available in soware applications, have a very short lifespan. Once the 
surprise element fades away aer their initial use, boredom soon follows.
I
Produces over-stimulation. As can happen with color, 3D generates an 
over-stimulating eﬀect that leads to eyestrain.
 
I
Hides data points. As in the previous chart, when points are represented 
in the apparent third dimension, it’s natural that the most distant points 
are hidden by closer points.
 
I
Takes up too much space. e introduction of pseudo-3D eﬀects forces an 
increment on the average space occupied by each point, which demands 
an increase in chart size or a reduction of the amount of data represented. 
Either option proves to be a mismanagement of the available space.
I
Is immature. Most adults acquired the ability of abstract thinking required 
to read a chart at around the age of 12. Representing data with blocks and 
disc slices is really regressing to an earlier age and would only make sense 
if it were accompanied by a clown nose.
Textures
If the whole point of adding pseudo-3D eﬀects is to create “physical objects,” then 
coloring the area within a slice or a bar using a ﬂat color defeats that purpose. In 
3D, the area of a slice or a bar becomes a surface that needs to be ﬁlled with a glossy 
texture. Texture makes things real, and the more real the objects look, the beer.

Figure 14.12 Pies made to be touched.
In Figure 14.12, only the small pie chart represents  
proportions correctly, but it’s easier to overlook it 
when pies in pseudo-3D look so real that you feel  
like touching them. (Note that in this case I added 
the dubious ﬂourish of reﬂections and shadows to  
make them even more real, while purposefully making 
the shadow position incompatible with the position of the  
light, which is a typical error.)
Textures are not an exclusive aribute of pseudo-3D charts, 
but it makes sense to use them when an author intends to  
give a physical quality to the chart. Because data visualization 
deals with abstract concepts and images, translating them  
into some physical shape is certainly a noble endeavor; 
however, we should call this something else, perhaps some  
form of data art that has to be measured by artistic criteria 
rather than by its compliance with the objectives of data  
visualization.
How about the sizing issue when using texture? Chelsea fans 
have good reasons to be unhappy with their team in the 2015–16 English Premier 
League soccer season 
, especially when compared to its 
performance of the previous season  
. 
Now tell me: How much larger would these two charts need to be if I wanted to 
add textures? If, instead of ﬂat colors like blue and red, you use a texture with 
a range of colors for each category (like the green slice in Figure 14.12), you’ll 
need many more pixels for the texture to communicate the physicality of the 
object. e objects must have a minimum dimension that allows the texture to 
be perceived and decoded, which means that the chart will necessarily be larger 
than a version without texture. e alternative is to reduce the number of data 
points displayed, if possible.
Textures also incur a serious productivity problem. While I was able to make the 
pie chart in the boom of Figure 14.12 in just a few seconds, the others took me 
much more time, because I kept playing with lighting and materials and angles 
and rotations and everything else that Excel puts at our disposal for adding 
useless formaing.

Titles
A chart has two basic groups of objects. e ﬁrst group includes all the data-
encoding objects: lines, bars, areas. Everything else is in a supporting role to 
help identify the data and to help in reading the chart or deﬁning its limits. Let’s 
start with the title. At ﬁrst you’ll build on the title, adding more and more detail 
so that it serves to help you deﬁne your information. Later, you’ll trim it to be 
comprehensive but extremely concise.
e most common way of titling a chart is to describe its contents—for example, 
“Age Structure of the German Population in 2050.” is tells us all about the vari-
ables involved but nothing about its insights.
A descriptive title is appropriate, but consider demoting the descriptive portion 
to a subtitle, using as the main title the chart’s message: “Germany in 2050: A 
Shrinking and Aging Population [as we can see from the chart].” e phrase “as 
we can see from the chart” helps to write the conclusion, although it should not 
actually appear in the title, naturally.
Now take another step and make it a more complex story: “In 2050, Germany 
will have a shrinking and aging population. is is due in part to the increase in 
life expectancy but above all the drastic decrease of birth rate, where an average 
of [value] children needed to replace generations will not be born, despite the 
immigrants whose share of the birth rate is increasing.”
Writing sentences like this helps us organize the information and lets the story 
ﬂow and make sense. is text is perfectly suited to describe a made-up model 
of the German demographic evolution. Now break it into several pieces that will 
be used in the chart titles. You can do it literally using ellipses (…drastic decrease 
of birth rate…) or by making some adjustments:
 
I
A shrinking and aging population (population pyramid)
 
I
Life expectancy will keep increasing (line chart)
 
I
Number of live births keeps trending down (line chart)
 
I
Number of live births will continue to be below generation replacement 
(bar chart displaying ratio of actual live births versus target live births)
 
I
Live births will remain high among immigrants and will account for a 
larger share of total live births (line chart displaying live births by mother’s 
country of birth).

14 I DESIGNING FOR EFFECTIVENESS

Regarding formaing, I rarely use the title object in an Excel chart. Most of the 
time I write titles in a cell above the chart, which usually allows for beer control. 
I also tend to accept the suggestions of several style guides and align titles to the 
le, which enhances readability when compared to centered titles.
Fonts
ere aren’t many opportunities for playing with extravagant fonts in business 
visualization. However, I still have fond memories of the time I used a “gore” font 
in a slide, looking perfect in all that gory black and red. Wouldn’t it be nice to use 
a gore font in a chart once in a while? Or perhaps a childish font, like Comic Sans? 
Well, the problem is that fonts help set the tone, and usually, a terror scene or a 
playground is not the best tone for regular quarterly business reviews.
In most charts, use a font that looks clean, neutral, and readable. Most standard 
sans serif fonts are OK, but you may not like a font at a given size, small or large.
For this book’s charts, I had to choose a standard Windows font, and it had to look 
good at a size of 8 points. Aer testing several fonts, I had to accept that Calibri 
was the best, given these constraints.
Annotations
Ploing unemployment rates (Figure 14.13) only shows us a sudden reversal of 
trend in 2008, but they tell us nothing about the possible causes. Add a few writ-
ten or visual annotations such as the date of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy 
and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis that led to the two Greek bailouts. ey 
can help us contextualize the data, giving the audience additional elements for 
interpreting the chart.
We saw how playing with salience allows us to create layers of data relevance 
in a chart. Now imagine a thin transparent ﬁlm over your chart, where you can 
freely add comments, notes, or contextual data. is “annotation layer” (as the 
New York Times graphics team calls it) can really help your audience read your 
chart. Annotate a chart as much as you need, but any notes should be useful and 
accurate and should not compete for aention; they should be a discreet but 
helpful whisper.

Grid Lines
Grid lines range from an excess of unjustiﬁable prominence to their complete 
removal, which they do not deserve.
I removed grid lines from Figure 14.13. Can you point to exactly where the 50% 
grid line would be on the le axis? at’s easy: You can expect it to be aligned 
with the middle of the “50” label. But will it be as easy to point to the same grid 
line on the vertical axis on the right? Actually, that would be a bit trickier, and 
I wouldn’t be surprised to ﬁnd an error margin of up to 0.1 inches, up or down.
We saw in Chapter 2 that Weber’s law justiﬁes grid lines and reference lines, 
because they facilitate the comparison among points, especially if the points are 
far apart. Bear in mind that the Gestalt law of ﬁgure/background tells us that 
they should only support the reading of the chart; they are not leading actors.
Grid lines should be present most of the time on the vertical axis, and also along 
the horizontal axis when using scaer plots or similar charts. eir number 
cannot be deﬁned at the outset, as that depends on the data itself, the scales, the 
chart size, and the chart’s aspect ratio. When you have a proﬁle chart, where 
multiple entities share the same scale, you will probably need more grid lines to 
accommodate all the diﬀerences.
at said, we saw that we oen split a distribution into four quartiles. We can 
borrow that reference and use three grid lines, dividing the scale into four sec-
tions, which will be a reasonable number for a typical chart. See this applied in 
Figure 14.14. Note that additional lighter, minor horizontal grid lines were also 
applied, but as you can see they’re not needed. And just imagine how busy the 
chart would look if they were at the same level as the major grid lines.

Clip Art
Clip art is sometimes used to add a touch of humor to a chart. Don’t do this. If the 
chart was designed to be fun, great, but adding a canned joke just “because” is 
a very bad idea, as we have seen in bad examples at the beginning of this book. 
at said, any text that could be replaced by an image may be replaced. For example, 
using known symbols to replace legends is a good idea. Corporate logos, country 
ﬂags, and club emblems are some of the possible candidates. A symbol renders 
reading more universal, but do not assume that because you can identify these 
symbols, all your audience will be able to do the same.

Hmm, well, not really. I’m afraid a dual-axis chart with diﬀerent scales is noth-
ing more than a sophisticated form of misleading. You could elect it as one of the 
deadly sins of data visualization.
Two independent scales mean that there is no relationship between them, so the 
limits and range of each scale depend only on the author’s discretion. However, 
the natural tendency of the author is to assign a series to each axis in a way that 
suggests similar paerns or a non-existent relationship (or unproven by the chart).
For some bizarre reason, economists seem to love dual-axis charts, judging by 
the numerous examples in ﬁnancial reports. In Figure 14.15 I’m replicating one 
of those examples. e series Consumption is arbitrarily associated with the 
secondary axis, and the range was adjusted to coincide as much as possible with 
the series Business.

If we do use a dual-axis chart, our ﬁrst priority must be to ensure that the reader 
immediately sees which series is assigned to which axis. is must be done visu-
ally, not in text. In this example, the association between Consumption and the 
secondary axis is made only aer reading the legend. Add the break in scales 
of both axes and you’re le with a chart that is nothing more than a repository 
of malpractices.
Now compare the chart with the one in Figure 14.16, and you’ll be surprised to

Be very clear about this point: Even if there is a perfect match between two series, 
even if this match is reinforced by a perfect correlation, and even if everything 
makes sense, there is never a good reason to use a dual-axis chart when there is 
a risk that the reader will compare series in both axes.
If we want to observe how similar or how correlated two variables are, there are 
correct forms for doing so. In most cases, the existence of two axes means that 
the author believes there is a relationship between variables. For time series, it’s 
easy to verify this using a connected scaer plot. Manipulating the scales until 
they “look good” is not one of the best practices—not by a long shot. In such a 
ﬂexible ﬁeld as data visualization, this particular rule stands almost as dogma.
Figure 14.16 Removing the secondary axis oﬀers an accurate comparison of all series.

Let’s look at the exceptions. ere aren’t any that I’m aware of when comparing 
variables. However, redundancy, equivalence, and perspective can justify the use 
of a secondary axis:
 
I
Redundancy. You have the same scale in both axes. It makes sense, in 
large charts, to help minimize saccadic movements and provide an equal 
reference on the far side.
 
I
Equivalence. e scales are diﬀerent but equivalent and, obviously, are 
synchronized. Euros and U.S. dollars, or Celsius and Fahrenheit are ex-
amples of equivalent scales.
 
I
Perspective. You want to see a series from two perspectives and it doesn’t 
make sense to compare them. e Pareto chart (from Chapter 9) is the most 
common example.
Legends
ink of legends as necessary evils. ey’re evil because they disrupt the chart 
reading ﬂow but are necessary for identifying the series when no beer alterna-
tive is available.
As we’ve seen, legends force continuous back and forth (saccadic) eye movement 
and color-matching tasks and should be avoided whenever possible through the 
use of the direct labeling of the series. is is an easy rule to apply to static line 
and pie charts, but may compromise readability in dynamic charts where labels 
risk overlapping when the data change. In cases where there is such risk or for-
mats in which the direct identiﬁcation is diﬃcult, set up the legend as close as 
possible to the data. Do not be afraid to put the legend within the data area. Just 
ensure, though, that it does not interfere with reading.
When encoding the series with colors, check whether you can tell them apart 
in the legend and whether it’s easy to match the key and the series. Because the 
color area in the legend is very small, it needs more color separation than when 
we compare large areas.
e legend border is at the top of the list of useless object formaing options 
available in Excel. Not surprisingly, until recently it was enabled by default. It 
might be possible to justify its use in some obscure scenario that, so far, I have 
not found. If you have an older version of Excel, it also presents a legend when 
there is only one series. Delete it as soon as you see it.

Backgrounds
Remember the heavily saturated yellow background of the bad example chart you 
had to endure at the beginning of this book, and how it contributed to its over-
stimulation? What about the chart with the photo of an empty playground, a 
few pages back?
ese two examples show that the background inﬂuences the way we read the 
chart, so it should be carefully evaluated. Of all the elements of a chart, the 
background should be less prominent (it’s called “background” for a reason). 
As a rule, it should have the same color as the surrounding area, although many 
exceptions may be considered.
In his 2004 book Show Me the Numbers, Stephen Few says that a background that 
is not neutral undermines data integrity, and any image useful to supplement 
the data should be used in proximity to the chart but not as background. at’s 
your safest bet, but if you want to deﬁne an emotional framework as was done in 
the live births example, you may get more aention using a background image.
Note that deﬁning an emotional framework and manipulating your audience’s 
feelings are not the same thing. e empty playground image in Figure 14.5 sets 
the stage, but our eyes are naturally drawn to the red line. It doesn’t compete with 
data for the audience’s aention and interfere with data perception as a color 
image would (don’t use color images as backgrounds). From there, it’s diﬃcult 
to establish other criteria for selecting the right image. e image must translate 
the message without excessive emotional manipulation. It should only be a foot 
in the door that leads people to want to know more.
Ordering the Data
We know that a chart lets us compare points, but an eﬀective comparison depends 
on choosing the right ordering key. Some keys, like time, seem so obvious that we 
don’t think much about them (although we should think about them, as we saw in 
the monthly births project in Chapter 6). When there’s a categorical scale, as in 
most bar charts, it’s more diﬃcult to determine the ordering key. Alphanumeric 
ordering is almost random, which makes it useless in graphical representations. 
We have to look for the right ordering key among the data.
In Figure 14.17, you’ll need some time to ﬁnd Colorado (CO), because none of the 
charts are using an alphanumeric key. But because that’s a state we’re interested 
in, I have emphasized it for you. (You’re welcome.)

is is a very common situation: comparing two years for a bunch of categories. 
ere is no right ordering key, because it depends on the task. If you want to 
emphasize the current status, you’ll use one key, and if you want to emphasize 
the starting point, you’ll use another key. e chart actually shows you both keys 
(current and starting point), while displaying the change to the other key. is 
makes it easy to spot that strong outlier on the le (California). e slope chart 
in the middle helps to make sense of the changes.
Making a decision on the ordering key is not always this easy. Take household 
expenditure. If you look carefully at the categories, you’ll see that they’re not 
ordered arbitrarily. In Figure 14.18, the pie chart makes it clear that the most 
basic items (Food, Housing, and Apparel) account for half of household expendi-
ture (the right half of the pie). is is an interesting insight. e bar chart looks 
unordered and doesn’t seem very useful.

In Figure 14.19, the insights change a bit, as does the role of each chart. Any im-
plied order in the categories was ignored in this alternative representation, and 
ordering is based only on the value of each category. Now, the bar chart is very 
eﬀective for comparing the categories, while the pie chart shows that Housing 
and Transportation account for half of the expenditure.
A third version (Figure 14.20) lies somewhat between the two previous ones: is 
version groups categories, orders the groups ﬁrst, and then categorizes within 
each group.

is classiﬁcation of expenditure, as well as other classiﬁcations (occupations, 
economic activities) shows how an apparently nominal variable may have an 
implicit order that we should be aware of, and that we must decide whether we 
want to respect. In other cases, although there is an implicit ordering, it may 
not be obvious to a layperson, so it’s useful to understand the rationale applied.
Any chart that uses a categorical axis requires making more or less arbitrary 
additional decisions regarding ordering. If possible, use chart types for which 
these decisions need not be made. e default ordering is by values (Figure 14.21). 
Use the nominal axis for special purposes, such as when you do want to change 
ordering, as was done in the example in Figure 14.18.

Number of Series
e maximum number of series in an Excel chart is set to 255. Of course, no one 
is going to represent 255 series, as this is a theoretical limit. Or is it?
In our classiﬁcation of chart types, we deﬁned two major groups: point comparison 
charts and data reduction charts. When thinking about the number of series or 
categories in a chart, the same rationale applies. When you want each series to 
remain unique and identiﬁable (in the legend), then six is a reasonable maximum 
reference value. When the series is diluted and what maers is the overall paern 
created by numerous series, then you can have hundreds or even thousands.
When three is the maximum number of objects stored in working memory and 
six is the number of colors we can discriminate comfortably³ (the number of 
“accents” in an Excel color theme), it’s justiﬁable to limit the number of series 
to a value between these two references. Take this with a grain of salt, however, 
because the number of series must be evaluated for each speciﬁc case.

e chart type, the variability, or overlapping and crossing points may or may 
not support the upper (more series) or lower (fewer series) thresholds. As we’ve 
seen since the beginning, more important than the number of series is creating 
a display that helps us make sense of the data, understand the distances between 
points, and observe paerns and detect extreme values.
Let’s look at some ways to reduce and manage the number of series and the 
number of points per series.
Chart Type
As we know, a point requires less space than a line, and a line requires less space 
than a bar. Hence the type of encoding we use is important for maximizing the 
number of series while maintaining the chart’s readability.
Remember when we compared pie charts to a slope chart in Chapter 1? With a 
lile irony, we could say that both chart types could handle more data: e slope 
chart would be able to maintain its readability level, while for pie charts it would 
be somewhat irrelevant to add more slices because they had already reached their 
level of absolute ineﬀectiveness.
Also, in the case of population pyramids, two series for each gender are suﬃcient 
to hamper reading the bar chart, while using lines supports a larger number of 
series.
Grouping
e level of detail should be appropriate to the task. Sometimes, over-aggregating 
hides (innocently or maliciously) the most relevant information. On the contrary, 
abundant details will aract aention to spurious variations, hiding the tree 
under the excess of leaves.
In our example, data on household consumption expenditure has 14 categories, 
making them candidates for some level of aggregation. e proposed grouping 
in Figure 14.20 to 5+1 (ﬁve plus a miscellaneous group) is displayed in the inner 
ring, while the outer ring details each of the groups. Regardless of the selected 
chart type, this is a useful solution: It aggregates and emphasizes categories at a 
higher grouping, while allowing us to explore the details.

353
Residual Category
In Figure 14.22, we decided that a hierarchical struc-
ture is not relevant to the analysis, and observing 
the main items is all that maers. Hence we have 
ordered them by value, creating a residual group of 
around 14 percent.
ese criteria are naturally adapted to the task, and 
one must ensure that the deﬁnition of a residual cat-
egory does not hide important details. We don’t have 
to aggregate the residual categories by consolidating 
them into a single value; a visual aggregation (by 
color) is enough, as in Figure 14.22, where residual 
categories remain separate (but in Excel, placing the 
cursor over them would identify them).
Context
We saw, in Figure 14.13, the evolution of the unemployment rate in several countries, 
grouped by gender and age group (youth and adults). is segmentation has gen-
erated 128 series, still far from Excel’s limit but incompatible with the traditional 
data visualization philosophy, wherein each series has to be clearly identiﬁed.
Our ﬁrst goal in this type of representation is to observe the overall paerns 
generated by a wide range of series. In this case, the chart draws aention to the 
sudden growth in unemployment aer 2008 and the fact that unemployment is 
consistently higher among young people than among adults. e chart shows the 
typical values of a set of data series given by their proximity and a denser zone, 
as well as cases in which the values are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent than this paern.
ese are important elements that you can see in a static version of the chart, but 
you can only learn more about the phenomenon represented here through some 
sort of interaction. You could switch between the diﬀerentiation by gender and 
age, for example, or emphasize the four series of a particular country. Imagine 
that this picture illustrates what happens in the Excel ﬁle: You click a line and all 
four series for the selected country are emphasized.
“But isn’t this a spaghei chart?” you might ask. Well, it surely looks like spaghei. 
But a “proper” spaghei chart occurs when you actually want to identify each 
series and you are unable to do so, or you’re unable to clearly see a paern or trend.

In other words, you have failed to capture the individual characteristics of each 
series. In this case, however, we’re providing a context to one or a small number 
of series, which we can clearly see, and through interaction with the Excel ﬁle, 
we can choose whatever series calls our aention.
Small Multiples
Figure 14.23 is split into four small multiples, each representing one of the four 
groups of variables. We can immediately see the diﬀerence between youth un-
employment and adult unemployment. We also see a denser paern for men and 
a more dispersed paern among women in both age groups, without having to 
observe this behavior through interaction. e interaction could be programmed 
so that, for example, by placing the cursor over a series in a chart, that country 
would also be highlighted in the remaining charts.

Interaction is another way of managing a number of sets greater than would be 
usefully represented in a single chart.
Lying and Deceiving 
with Charts
If you allow me to update the famous quote aributed to Disraeli, there are four 
kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, statistics, and visualization. is puts data visual-
ization at a higher level of wickedness and persuasiveness.
If someone wants to twist the facts beyond what is legitimate, they will do so, 
regardless of the means chosen. Blind trust in our eyes (pun intended) makes us 
more vulnerable to visual lies.
Charts are always an interpretation of data, in the same way that a photo is an 
interpretation of reality, no maer how objective it may seem. is should be not 
only recognized but encouraged (the editorial dimension we have talked about 
throughout this book) within an ethical framework that seeks to identify its own 
subjectivity and minimize its inﬂuence on choices. ere can be no contradiction 
between “what I want to say” and “what the data say.” is diﬀerence is oen 
diﬃcult to detect, especially when the subject’s message is fully determined by 
his beliefs, ideological position, and activism. 
e examples we’ll see below do not exhaust the diversity and subtlety of visual 
lies; they only purport to identify some of the most pathological cases. If you 
want a more systematic and exhaustive list, Gerald Evere Jones’s How to Lie with 
Charts is the obvious reference. Alberto Cairo’s e Truthful Art also deals with 
truth and lies in visualization, but Cairo takes a subtler approach. He wants to 
help readers recognize the truth and make it stronger (by combining visualiza-
tions with statistical methods, for example).
As a follower (and also as a member) of social network communities interested 
in data visualization, I frequently stumble upon links to the daily changing 
“worst chart ever” (many people in social networks are addicted to their daily 
dose of outrage). In most cases, the “worst chart ever” is just a chart in which the 
designer exaggerated his willingness to do things diﬀerently, combined with a 
profound numerical illiteracy. All these charts lie, but in most of them there is 
more ignorance than malice. e more extreme the actor’s voice, the greater his 
likelihood for manipulation.

DATA AT WORK
356
Data, Perception, and Cognition
e ﬁrst requirement for a chart not to lie is, naturally, that the data don’t lie 
either. As we have seen, the hidden agenda of those who produce and dissemi-
nate data, the way they want to frame their reality, and how metrics, concepts, 
and parameters are deﬁned may make the degree of data’s truth vary. Having 
veriﬁed these conditions, we can only check whether choices in the graphical 
representation truthfully reﬂect the data.
One of the most transverse and insidious forms of a lie is the conﬂict between 
the perceptual and cognitive dimensions of a chart. As we know, what we see in 
the chart can’t be corrected by the legend or other objects.
Exaggerating Diﬀerences
e quantitative scale in a chart should start at zero by default. is rule conﬂicts 
with the need to observe in more detail (with beer resolution) the diﬀerences 
between points. Any solution that breaks the scale has to be studied to ensure 
that the message’s essence is not biased. Some charts are more sensitive to the 
absence of the origin: Bar charts and area charts do not tolerate it, as the scale 
must represent all values, beginning with zero.
In Figure 14.24, the small diﬀerence between the two values is magniﬁed to an 
absurd level because the minimum value was set to 49. is example seems to 
exceed the limit of common sense, but the proportions are identical to a chart 
that was featured on Venezuelan TV showing the results of presidential elections.

Distorting Time Series
In a time series, the intervals between periods should remain constant. If that’s 
not possible, the scale should reﬂect this fact, varying the distances proportionally 
along the axis. e le chart in Figure 14.25 shows that if you have time intervals 
of one, ﬁve, and ten years and you don’t take that into account, you’ll generate 
an exponential curve. If you respect proportions, you’ll get a linear projection. 
is is a case of numeric illiteracy that inﬂuences how the chart is rendered. 
I oen see this in newspapers. To correct this problem in Excel, set the horizontal 
axis as a date.

Aspect Ratio
e charts in Figure 14.25 respect the original chart aspect ratio, which is almost 
1: 1, or in other words, almost square. is accentuates the curve slope, which, 
along with the error in scale, accentuates the diﬀerence regarding the reliability 
of the data.
ere is no rule deﬁning the relationship between the width and height of a chart. 
In general, charts should be rectangular, except for the scaer plot, which should 
be square. In this book, the aspect ratio of the plot area is usually around 1.6: 1. 
William Cleveland suggests a line chart’s aspect ratio depends on its slope, which 
should be adjusted to a value of around 45º (the slope of the corrected version in 
the preceding example).

e best rule is to maintain consistency, justify any inconsistencies, and, in line 
charts, apply the rule to include two or more series so that the slope is analyzed 
in relation to the various series, not in absolute terms.
Omitting Points
In Figure 14.26, compare the darker gray bar with the remaining gray bars, ignor-
ing the white ones. Now, repeat the analysis including all bars. I don’t think you’ll 
come up with the same conclusions, because the context of the dark gray bar was 
altered. If the set of all bars form a coherent group, cherry-picking only a few 
that support an argument is obviously a lie.
Figure 14.26 Cherry-picking data to make a point.
Mistaking Variation for Evolution
e diﬀerence in values between two dates is just a variation; it’s not possible 
to draw any conclusions about the evolution in the data because there aren’t 
enough data points.
When we choose two points only, we have more freedom to select the variables 
that we want to represent, as we’re not conditioned by their long-term evolu-
tion. is is probably one of the reasons why variation charts are common in 
annual reports.
e chart in Figure 14.27, inspired by a bank’s annual report, uses only two time 
periods in addition to the capital sin of transforming a real variation of –15.1% 
into a graphical variation of –49% by eliminating the origin without warning.

Double Axes
e use of dual-axis charts is a subtle form of graphical lie through which, as we 
have seen, a spurious relationship is established between variables. Considering 
that the author of a dual-axis chart tries to harmonize the representation, it’s 
natural to break some rules: e vertical scale is one of the ﬁrst victims.
In the rare cases where two axes are acceptable, as in the Pareto chart, it’s essential 
that the audience make an immediate visual association between the series and 
the corresponding axis and not through a mere reference in the legend.
Pseudo 3D
e pie chart in Figure 14.28 shows how, in addition to all other problems, the 
pseudo-3D eﬀect distorts chart reading. e labeled segments both have the 
same value, but the one “closer” to the 
observer is perceived to be larger (and 
it is graphically larger). In a bar chart, 
as we saw earlier in this chapter, the 
second kind of chart most aﬀected by 
this malformation, the parallax eﬀect 
renders bar comparison impossible 
and, in some cases, hides a substantial 
number of bars that are “behind” the 
higher bars.

Context
Most graphic lies are stupid or ignorant, and can be easily spoed by a trained 
eye. On rare occasions, ideological debate becomes interesting, and if it includes 
aspects of data visualization, all the beer. Let me give you an example.
Figure 14.29 shows the steep decline of the infant mortality rate in Spain and 
in Portugal. In the 1970s, both countries underwent regime changes, from dic-
tatorships to democracies. Now, let me ask you this: Judging from the chart, do 
you think these regime changes had a disruptive impact in infant mortality? 
I presume you’ll say “yes” for Spain and “no” for Portugal. If you were a Portuguese 
conservative, you would like this idea that the le-wing revolution didn’t do much 
to improve infant mortality, while in Spain conservatives would say democracy 
actually harmed infant mortality.

We must understand that these countries were not exactly North Koreas of the 
time. Hard trends in Europe also occurred in the Iberian Peninsula, even if more 
tenuously. e 1960s and the 1970s were years of strong decline in infant mortality 
rates, especially where they remained high.
So it makes sense to check whether the infant mortality rate in a country was 
declining at a speed above or below the regional average (say, the future eurozone 
EZ-17). As you can see in Figure 14.30, Spain always remained a lile below the 
average, except for a period of about eight years before dictator Franco’s death, 
when mortality decreased a lot (between 1965 and 1973), and returning to the EU 
average aer that. So apparently democracy was bad for the infant mortality rate 
in Spain. One day I’ll need to understand the reasons for this.

In Portugal, the dictatorship kept the infant mortality rate at much more than 
double that of the EU during the 1960s. And suddenly, three years before the 
revolution in 1974, they changed public healthcare and infant mortality started 
a long and consistent downward trend.
You can have both the absolute and the relative interpretations. Politicians oen 
choose one of the two, depending on which one beer ﬁts their agenda. Just 
like many variables follow the regional distribution of population, a majority 
of phenomena are inﬂuenced by hard trends, and you should identify them and 
factor them in.
When Everything Goes
Data visualization also has to endure its share of outright lies (and liars). From a 
biased “infographic” that reﬂects only the author’s agenda to a bar that goes up 
instead of down (you need only search Internet images for “Fox News charts” to 
ﬁnd them), you should be prepared for everything.
At the top of Figure 14.31 you can ﬁnd a helpful template for preposterous lies. 
It basically contains two arrows free from any constraints of scale. en you add 
a fake time series to make it look like a real chart. One of the arrows demonstrates 
that your adversary is not doing what it should be doing. e second arrow shows 
that the bad things it was already doing are now skyrocketing. At the boom of 
Figure 14.31 is a real-world example of applying this template.
Interestingly, when caught with such lies, the typical author’s response is, “Well, 
you could read the numbers; they were there,” which is basically the same argu-
ment used to defend pie charts. is is outright poor business practice.

Takeaways
 
I
Design is always present in data visualization, but its nature changes from 
functional to decorative.
 
I
While it remains at a functional level, design depends more on data man-
agement skills than on graphic design skills.
 
I
Apply Occam’s razor to remove all that is irrelevant in a chart, minimize 
the accessories, adjust what is needed, and add what is missing.
 
I
Provide an emotional hook if you think your audience needs one. A title 
that frames the question, a background image with a real or symbolic link 
to the reality the chart is portraying, and the promise of an answer can keep 
the audience interested. en, since you already provided the emotional 
framework, your following charts can be more functional and complex.
 
I
Pseudo-3D eﬀects, textures, and dual-axis charts have no place in business 
visualization.
 
I
Annotate your charts in meaningful ways.
 
I
Finish the sentence, “As you see in the chart…” and use your response to write 
chart titles.
 
I
Use the titles to write one or more sentences. is will make it easier to ﬁnd 
the right sequence for presenting your charts.
 
I
ere are many ways to lie with charts. Do your best to avoid them, while 
retaining your editorial discretion.

COLOR:  
BEYOND AESTHETICS
Avoid catastrophe. According to Edward Tue, this is “the ﬁrst prin-
ciple” when using color in data visualization.¹  Given the complexity 
contained in this warning, avoiding catastrophe is not an easy task 
to achieve.
Color is a complicated physiological phenomenon associated with 
symbolic, aesthetic, and emotional qualities. Each of these qualities is 
enough by itself to wreak havoc in data visualizations if not treated 
with care. Together, they make disaster almost inevitable and justify 
Tue’s principle.

In an organizational environment, the talent of applying subtle color harmonies 
isn’t one of the most valued skills, as proven by the frequent use of primary colors 
splashed onto spreadsheets. Other factors that aﬀect color in business visualiza-
tion include corporate branding guidelines and the diﬀerences between what you 
see on a computer monitor and what you see on a projector screen.
It’s natural to assume that a color disaster will take the shape of an aesthetic aber-
ration. But in fact (and this will be a relief to some readers and heresy to others), 
the aesthetic quality of color has lile relevance in business visualization. Let 
this sink in for a moment. It is the key that opens the door to a functional approach 
to color, in which certain aspects are handled in a rational way to achieve the 
goals of the graphical representation:
I
e ﬁrst and most important functional quality of color is its suitability 
to the task. For example, color selection diﬀers depending on whether you 
want to encode either a categorical variable or a variable with a continu-
ous range of values.
 
I
e second functional quality of color is stimuli intensity. Pure primary 
colors and pastel colors have diﬀerent intensity levels, which allow us to 
establish various levels of chart reading and evaluate the stimulus intensity 
of each object on the chart.
I
e ﬁnal functional quality of color is, in a broad sense, its symbolism. As we 
saw in the vegetable availability chart in Figure 3.3, for example, switching 
expected colors creates a cognitive dissonance that is diﬃcult to overcome.
ese are the functional qualities of color that we should focus on. If we succeed, 
the result will be an eﬀective chart. We are also likely to avoid an aesthetic disaster, 
even if the result may not be worthy of an art gallery.
e aesthetic quality of color is more subjective and diﬃcult to functionalize, 
but we can even improve color aesthetics if we follow the classical rules of color 
harmony. As you’ll see later in this chapter, these rules correspond to positions 
on the color wheel, facilitating their selection while also allowing the expression 
of personal sensibilities.
But before all this, let’s analyze the physical components of color and the ways 
in which we try to quantify it.
www.ebook3000.com

15 I COLOR: BEYOND AESTHETICS
367
Quantifying Color
Like sound, color does not have an absolute value. Both result from the way our 
senses respond to certain wavelengths, and the way our senses respond to color 
depends on surrounding colors, lighting, and the physical composition of our 
photoreceptor cells in the retina, among other factors. We can conﬁrm the rela-
tive and subjective value of color in Figure 15.1, which represents one of the most 
basic optical illusions dealing with color. Compare the blue tone in each square. 
e blue square on the right appears darker, but believe it or not, the blue tone 
is exactly the same in both squares.
e way people verbalize color is also diﬀerent. is is evident when comparing 
men’s and women’s color preferences. Women oen appear to be more sensitive to 
small color variations, while men are easily satisﬁed by broader color categories.
We categorize color when we say that the rainbow has seven colors (red, orange, 
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet), but where are the cut-oﬀ points, and how 
can we guarantee that the color spectrum is covered in a reasonably comprehensive 
way and that there are no overlapping categories? In fact, one can’t do it without 
a more objective classiﬁcation. Hence, a quantitative approach is necessary so 
that, for example, a computer can tell a mobile phone what “Prussian blue” is 
and how to represent it.
Figure 15.1 Which one is darker? Are you sure?

DATA AT WORK
368
The RGB Model
We saw in Chapter 2 that photoreceptor cells are sensitive to wavelengths corre-
sponding to colors near red (R), green (G), and blue (B), from which the remaining 
colors are obtained. Your computer uses a similar color-coding model, where each 
color (channel) has a value between 0 and 255. e total number of colors is the 
result of multiplying the three channels: 256 x 256 x 256 = 16.8 million combina-
tions, approximately.
e image in Figure 15.2 shows the Colors dialog box in Excel where you can 
choose a custom color, with the RGB model selected. Note the values for Red, 
Green, and Blue below. In this model, the RGB code (0,0,0) is the minimum value 
of each channel and consequently the 
absence of color, so it’s the code for black. 
On the other extreme, the RGB code 
(255,255,255) corresponds to the maxi-
mum value of the three channels, and it’s  
the code for white. When the three colors 
have the same value, we obtain a shade  
of gray. Several of the most common  
colors are combinations of the values 
0, 128, and 255. Red has the RGB code 
(255,0,0), green has the RGB code (0,255,0), 
and blue has the RGB code (0,0,255).  
e “classic” green is much darker  
than the one in the electromagnetic 
spectrum and is closer to the RGB code 
(0,128,0).
The HSL Model
Taking into account the examples above, we might be led to believe that the RGB 
model is intuitive and we can easily realize which color corresponds to a certain 
code or which code we need to obtain a particular color. But with the exception of 
the maximum, minimum, and the middle values, it isn’t easy to determine which 
color corresponds to a certain code combination or how to vary a color tone.

model in Excel.

15 I COLOR: BEYOND AESTHETICS

e HSL model is more intuitive. Unlike RGB, it doesn’t refer to color combina-
tions. Instead, it uses three dimensions of color: hue (H), saturation (S), and 
luminance (L):
 
I
Hue corresponds to the colors we 
observe in the electromagnetic 
spectrum, ranging from zero (red) 
to 255 (violet), and runs along the 
horizontal axis in the Custom tab 
of the Colors dialog box in Excel 
(Figure 15.3).
 
I
Saturation is the second dimen-
sion, the measurement of color 
purity. e more saturated, the 
purer the color. When we reduce 
saturation, every hue eventually 
fades into a uniform shade of 
gray. Saturation runs along the 
vertical axis of the Custom tab 
of the Colors dialog box. As you 
can see, no maer which hue you select, you always get gray when you 
minimize saturation.
 
I
Luminance is the intensity of light. Regardless of whether hue is highly 
saturated, color varies according to the intensity of incident light. e 
more intense the light is, the lighter the hue becomes; the less intense the 
light, the darker the hue. If you minimize the luminance, there is no light, 
and no maer what hue and saturation values you choose, you’ll always 
get black. Pure color corresponds to the intermediate point in the range 
(128 in Excel, 50% in other systems). A light gray tone, for example, has low 
saturation and high luminance and does not depend on the chosen hue. 
In Excel, you change luminance using the vertical strip to the right of the 
Custom tab of the Colors dialog box.
To understand the diﬀerence between color and hue, think about brown: Most 
people will agree that brown is a color, but a brown hue doesn’t actually exist; 
the color is the result of combining orange hues with saturation and luminance.
Figure 15.3 Choosing colors using the HSL 
model in Excel.

DATA AT WORK
370
A simple exercise shows how much more intuitive the HSL model is. In Excel’s 
Colors dialog box, select the Custom tab and, with the RGB color model selected, 
enter the values 162, 90, 18, a brown tone. Move the slider for luminance as if you 
were creating a color ramp for a chart. You’ll notice that the values change in all 
RGB channels. Now re-enter the same codes, choose the HSL model and change 
the luminance strip again. Notice that only the luminance value is modiﬁed. 
Combining values for three switches is harder than changing a single one. at’s 
why applying a continuous variation in luminance, a characteristic of most color 
ramps, is simpler in HSL than in RGB.
e table in Figure 15.4 displays some colors and allows us to compare values for 
the RGB and HSL models. e ﬁrst seven hues are pure: saturation remains at 255 
and luminance at 128. Note that brown and orange have the same hue (21), but 
brown has lower saturation and lower luminance. (Other deﬁnitions of brown 
will have slightly diﬀerent codes.)

Etiquee tells us that WE SHOULD NOT WRITE WITH ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, 
because that’s equivalent to shouting, which is not very polite. If we want to 
emphasize something, we should use bold or italics instead. is modulation of 
the writing tone is useful for distinguishing between various parts of speech.

In data visualization, color is one of the instruments that we have to play this role. 
Pure colors produce intense, vibrant, and oen aggressive stimuli, and are the 
chromatic equivalent of shouting, while pastel shades are so and ease conﬂict, 
even if your choice of hues is not harmonious.
e impact of the intensity of chromatic stimuli diﬀers, depending on the size 
of the color patch. e colors of the squares on the le in Figure 15.5 generate 
stimuli that are too intense and aggressive. eir use in a bar chart would be 
classiﬁed as a catastrophe. While maintaining the same intensity, the impact of 
the thinner lines is lower due to the reduced area they occupy. e thicker lines 
increase the conﬂict again.
Pure colors
Less saturation
Adjusted hues
Figure 15.5 The impact of stimuli intensity depends on the size of the color patch.
e second group uses the same hues of the ﬁrst one, with added luminance and 
less saturation. Although the results are still not an example of harmony, and 
while these transformations have generated an intensity imbalance, this version 
is less troublesome than the ﬁrst one.
To those less sensitive to color harmony, there is a useful corollary to this adjust-
ment: A reduction in stimuli intensity increases the tolerance for errors in 
the selection of a color palee. is means that, even if the basic hues are not 
harmonious, managing luminance and saturation reduces the intensity of the 
stimulus and the result becomes less unpleasant.
I made slight changes to the hues in the third group, adjusting them to ﬁt one 
of the rules of color harmony that we’ll mention later in this chapter. With the 
HSL model selected, I adjusted saturation and luminance to balance the intensity 
between the three colors. e result is clearly beer than in the other two groups. 
e categories remain very distinct, are not overstimulating, and oﬀer a more 
pleasant combination.

DATA AT WORK
372
We increase or reduce the intensity of the stimuli depending not only on the 
type of chart but also on the technology involved, because there are substantial 
diﬀerences in how various tools process colors. Your chart will have some color 
diﬀerences among monitors, when printed, or when projected on a screen. ere 
are some ways to minimize these diﬀerences, such as increasing saturation and 
hue separation when planning to use an LCD projector, but it is advisable to 
always check the result in advance.
The Functional Tasks of Color
e colors of both sets of squares in Figure 15.6 are ordered (ﬁrst by luminance 
and then by hue). While this statement is evident for the set on the le, it’s less 
obvious for the set on the right. Although the hues are distributed along the elec-
tromagnetic spectrum, we cannot associate them to continuous values. Instead, 
we associate only categories: Blue is simply diﬀerent from red, and both blue 
and red are diﬀerent from yellow, which is neither higher nor lower than green. 
Hence, the statement that both sets of squares are ordered is open to doubt. Except 
when they are very close, hues represent unordered categories.
Ordered by luminance
Ordered by hue
Figure 15.6 Unlike changes in luminance and saturation, ordering hues by wavelength 
doesn’t translate into a perception of order.
Unlike hues, other color dimensions are related to the perception of intensity 
levels ordered along a quantitative scale, as shown in the ﬁrst set of squares.
is distinction between diﬀerent hues and variations in intensity ﬁts the clas-
siﬁcation of qualitative and quantitative variables, in which the quantitative 
variables are continuous by nature, while qualitative variables can be categorical 
(having no implied order) or ordinal (having some sort of order).
www.ebook3000.com

15 I COLOR: BEYOND AESTHETICS
373
In short, the encoding of categorical variables is associated with the selection 
of hues, while encoding continuous variables is associated with luminance and, 
to a lower extent, saturation (it’s beer to consider saturation a dimension that 
helps with ﬁne-tuning hues).
Another factor must be considered here, which is how we interpret the data and how 
our interpretation is reﬂected in the message that we try to communicate through 
a graphical representation. From the intersection between “how to encode” and 
“how to interpret” result six major functional tasks of color in data visualization:
 
I
Categorize
 
I
Group
 
I
Emphasize
 
I
Sequence
 
I
Diverge
 
I
Alert
Let’s detail each one of these.
Categorize
e ﬁrst (and most common) functional task of color in data visualization is to 
categorize the data. Each series or category acquires its own identity, which is 
expressed in the chart legend. When other criteria are not taken into account, 
series identiﬁcation takes place primarily by selecting hues. Hues should be 
perceptually distinct and the perceptual weight of each series must not diﬀer 
signiﬁcantly, unless we have justiﬁcation for it. In Figure 15.7, the criterion for 
choosing hues far apart for the two series is the qualitative diﬀerence (gender), 
without any ordering.

DATA AT WORK
374
Figure 15.7 Using opposite hues to encode gender.
None of the functional tasks of color should be le to soware application default 
seings. However, because of the sequence of default colors, categorizing will prob-
ably suﬀer less than other tasks by leing the application color-code the series, 
provided the default color palee is well chosen. Still, this will only be valid for 
a small number of series. e higher the number, the more author intervention 
in color management will be needed.
e legend in Figure 15.8 was generated by Excel. ere seems to be a purpose 
of encoding countries based on cool and warm colors. If it made sense to color- 
code 32 series in a chart, this encoding would be quite useful. However, a closer 
inspection shows no obvious criteria, beyond the rotation of colors available in 
the palee.

Figure 15.8 An apparently interesting color coding is in fact  
meaningless.
Anyone without signiﬁcant vision impairments can diﬀerentiate at least a few 
hundred thousand colors under optimum viewing conditions. It is diﬃcult, 
however, to perform a color-matching task when you have 32 series in a chart. 
It’s therefore natural to ask ourselves what is the practical limit on the number 
of colors. A palee of never more than 12 (including white, black, and gray) is a 
defensible answer, but the best one is to use as few as possible, because having to 
make an eﬀort to discriminate colors is contrary to the spirit of visualization.
Depending on your perspective, other values may pop up.
e colors of the rainbow are universal and easily discriminated, so seven is 
a good number to start with. is is the number suggested by Stephen Few, or 
more precisely, a palee with 7 + 1 colors where gray is the additional color code.²
In many circumstances, even using seven colors is excessive. A large data varia-
tion can hide paerns or hinder comparisons. When we use legends, it’s neces-
sary to take into account the reduced capacity of short-term memory, which also 
contributes to reducing the real maximum limit. But there is a trick to maximize 
the number of colors we can use, and that is by grouping them.

Group
A chart results from the interaction of many factors. at’s why looking at 
categorization and assuming that all categories are distinct and independent is 
insuﬃcient. For several reasons (for example, data variation and the limits of 
the working memory), we can argue (as we did in the preceding chapter) that 
the maximum number of series should be set between three and six, where six 
series should sound a warning to the strong probability that we are making an 
ineﬀective chart.
However, the greater the number of categories, the greater the possibility and 
usefulness of grouping them. Take household expenditure items such as food, 
beverages, communications, and transportation. Instead of four distinct hues, we 
could create one group of food and beverages and a second group of communica-
tions and transportation. We don’t have to actually sum them; we can visually 
group them using two hues and then vary the other dimensions of color. e pie 
charts in Figure 15.9 are an example, which we saw earlier in Figure 2.22 in the 
discussion of the Gestalt laws.
Figure 15.9 Grouping categories by hue.
It’s easy to select four diﬀerent base hues and four equally diﬀerent variations 
for each base hue, so that without much eﬀort we can use 16 color codes on a 
chart, far surpassing the limit of 12 hues that seemed to exist and that has already 
guaranteed some chart reading diﬃculty.
is shows how important it is not to take these rules as absolute and literal refer-
ences, but only as indicators that need to be adapted to speciﬁc circumstances. It 
also proves that rules can be bent when we actually think about the data.
Let’s return to the issue of identifying 32 countries. In Figure 15.10, identifying 
each country by color would be catastrophic. Having to increase the chart’s size 
to accommodate the legend would be unwieldy, but also expecting the reader 
to perform color matching for all 32 countries seems overly optimistic. e 
chosen option facilitates the identiﬁcation of countries by group and suggests

a geographical/political reading based on the use of only two color codes (for 
Western Europe and Eastern Europe, and gray for the EU-28).
Although identiﬁcation is a functional task of color, this example shows that in-
dividual identiﬁcation is not always necessary at the actual level of the entities, 
which can free color to oﬀer another level of reading. We’ve been reusing this 
idea since the beginning of this book.

Emphasize
As a general principle, we should avoid any unwanted perceptual imbalance, in 
which some entities receive more aention only because of the characteristics 
of their chosen color.
e operative word in the previous paragraph is “unwanted.” When we make a 
chart, it’s natural that our knowledge and editorial decisions lead us to suggest 
an interpretation of the data, or of formaing the chart for ease of reading based 
on the audience proﬁle.
When emphasizing an element in the chart, we give it more perceptual weight 
than others, through a degree of contrast and salience. We might provide more 
saturation over less saturation, less luminance over more luminance, or an opposite 
hue to a set of similar hues.
In addition to directing focus through manipulating object colors, we can also 
do so by adding context variables, such as adding background shading during 
periods of recession in a time series.
We applied the functional task of color in many of the charts in this book. In 
Figure 15.11, we use it to emphasize a subset of countries—namely, those where the 
gap for healthy life expectancy between men and women is more than three years.
We’re dealing with an editorial decision that could be diﬀerent, depending on 
the context and the message. More than any other functional task, emphasis is 
based on an evaluation of data relevance and on how it could be read. is kind of 
prerogative must therefore be exercised with full awareness of its implications.
e chart from Figure 14.5 in the previous chapter, displaying the evolution of 
live births, reaches an extreme level of emphasis by using a single red line that 
evolves on a gray background.
Sequence
Unlike previous tasks, a sequence through a color ramp assumes the orderly 
display of points or series.
Although used more oen to represent intensities in thematic maps (such as 
population densities or changes in terrain features), color ramps are useful for 
facilitating the perception of the order or continuity, when it exists.

e bars in Figure 15.13 are a fragment of the chart in Figure 15.12 where I used 
multiple hues instead of a single hue with multiple luminance levels. Apart from 
an excessive use of color, the le chart induces a discrete reasoning of compar-
ing category to category. e chart on the right, on the other hand, induces some 
continuity and a reasoning of association and correlation. It’s easier to see here 
an example of Engel’s law (with increasing income, the food share in total expenses 
decreases) than in the version on the le.

Proportion of household expenditure per category and income quintile
Figure 15.13 Hues favor discrete reasoning.
e HSL model facilitates the creation of color ramps. Just choose the hue, set 
the minimum and maximum luminance, and divide this range in equal parts, as 
in the example of Figure 15.14, where a new level of luminance was applied at 
intervals of 32. From a cursory glance, this seems like a very useful color ramp. 
But if you look more closely, you’ll notice some unpleasant inconsistencies—for 
example, the distance between the 96 and the 128 seems greater than between 
other pairs. is occurs both in color and in shades of gray, where variations in 
lighter shades seem greater than variations in darker shades.

In some more sophisticated color models, this lack of linearity in color percep-

ere is no simple way to create a color ramp whose distances are perceptually 
similar. If the ramps available in your 
Excel color theme are not suitable, 
try to create a new one by varying the 
luminance as done above. Starting from 
regular intervals, increase the distance 
in low luminance and reduce it in high 
luminance until the steps look right. 
At the end of the chapter, you will ﬁnd 
references to sources of color palees 
that include the ability to create these 
color codes so you don’t actually have 
to do it yourself.
e ramp in Figure 15.14 was created 
with the default Excel Colors dialog box 
(Figure 15.15), starting from the exterior 
colors and moving toward the center.
Diverge
e diverging scales represent the intensity of a deviation from a central point 
or reference point. It’s important to underline the word “intensity,” because it 
gives us the key to the design of divergent scales, which must use two contrasting 
hues, not a multitude of hues (rainbow scale).
When it comes to diverging scales (Figure 15.16), just choose (in the Excel Colors 
dialog box) the center line that clearly distinguishes two diverging scales. It’s likely 
that you’ll have to manually adjust the luminance or saturation of some colors.
Figure 15.15 Excel dialog box for choosing 
standard colors.
Figure 15.16 Two versions of a diverging scale: continuous and categorical.
Unlike their use in cartography, diverging scales are rarely used when making 
traditional charts. ey could be used more oen to represent the results of scales 
in questionnaires, such as the Likert scale.³

To create a diverging color scale in Figure 15.17, items below the middle category 
are displayed to the le of the axis and items above the middle category are dis-
played to the right. e middle category was split, half to the le and half to the 
right. As suggested in the Robbins et al. article, this category is not visually split 
by the axis line.

A much more common use of color scales is in graphical tables, where you can 
apply conditional formaing. In Figure 15.18, I deﬁned 10 color codes using the 
diverging scale presented in Figure 15.15. is is granular enough, and you have 
beer control over the color scale than using a true color ramp.

Alert
In Figure 15.17, you’ll notice a small red circle in front of Greece. is is to alert 
you that Greece is the only truly unhappy country, because negative responses 
outnumber positive responses.
We already saw other examples of alerts in previous chapters. Depending on how 
you size and format an alert, you will want to use a high-intensity chromatic 
stimulus, along with a conventional meaning (such as the use of red to signal 
danger), to make sure the alert is not overlooked.
Color Symbolism 
We know the color of our organization, of the sports team we cheer for, and of 
the ﬂag of the country where we were born. We know that the sky is blue, the 
land is brown, and the snow is white. We know that love is red, hope is green, 
and envy is yellow. e boy is blue and the girl is pink. In Christianity, the color 
purple is associated with the Passion of Christ. In Hinduism, saﬀron is the color 
of ﬁre and is the most sacred color.
e audience expects us to honor the symbolic use of color, from the colors shared 
with the whole community down to the colors speciﬁc to a group.⁴ Using conven-
tional color symbolism simpliﬁes communication, recognizes group values, and 
does not generate unpleasant and somehow annoying situations, such as using 
pink for boys and blue for girls. 
Unsuitable color choices are not always obvious. Do you remember the red line 
showing the evolution in the number of births (Figure 14.5)? As the color associ-
ated with danger, it’s natural for red to be chosen when something goes wrong. 
But it’s also part of the basic rules of political communication not to give bad 
news wearing a red tie. For internal presentations within organizations, colors 
tend to be chosen in order to minimize the impact of negative product sales and 
to maximize the impact of their growth.
4 Tip: If you want to use the colors of your organization, request their RGB codes instead of trying 
to guess them.

Color symbolism should be seen not only as a cultural construct but also as a 
representation of the physical world, although the relationship to the physical 
world can be more ﬂexible, depending on the situation. But we should avoid cer-
tain associations: Meat is not green, water is not red, human skin is not purple 
(most of the time).
The Role of Gray
An excessive use of adjectives is considered a bad sign in literature, and it’s easy 
to see why: e author has not been able to engage the reader through subtler 
writing and, to compensate, smacks you with prepackaged emotions. In data 
visualization, color resembles the adjectives in literature, and like adjectives, 
color should be used sparingly.
Believe it or not, a colorless chart is a great starting point. Yes, the notion of a 
monochrome chart will be strange to those born in the world of PowerPoint and 
color printers, and may induce painful memories for those who suﬀered through 
presentations with transparencies and other artifacts of the computer Stone Age. 
But removing color is a common experiment in the creative process of a graphic 
designer. Testing monochrome versions allows the designer to focus on other 
qualities, such as the shapes, sizes, and position of objects. It is commonly said 
that if a monochrome version works, a color version will also work.
As we’ve seen, a chart supports a very limited number of colors. Using shades 
of gray helps us identify this limit. If you can no longer diﬀerentiate between 
shades of gray, it’s likely that you have reached the limit and you’ll have to use 
an alternate form of representation.
We can always count on pie charts as a source of bad examples. In this case, a pie 
chart can illustrate the unnecessary use of color. Figure 15.19 shows only a few 
results of an image search for “pie charts” and demonstrates how diﬃcult it is to 
imagine a pie chart without several rainbow colors.

However, the grayscale example in Figure 15.20 shows that color is unnecessary 
for identifying segments or for emphasizing a particular segment. e grayscale 
pie chart exhibits an understated but eﬀective elegance (if one can say that about 
pie charts), which makes it even more obvious that there are too many colors in 
the version on the le.
An emotional reaction to color is inevitable, which inﬂuences the assessment 
of other aspects of the chart. e way we look at the grayscale pie chart on the 
right is more neutral and rational. Also, printing grayscale images is much less 
costly than color printing and ensures that variations are noticeable even by 
those with color blindness.

Figure 15.20 Because slices don’t overlap and can’t be misidentiﬁed somehow, color-coding 
them is purely discretionary.
Of course, the world is not black and white, and I don’t intend to persuade you 
to use only shades of gray in all your charts, but experimenting with grays will 
help you create a focused foundation for using color stimuli that beer ﬁt the 
message you want to convey.
e latest versions of Excel include a palee of gray tones, so you will be able to 
experiment with formaing your charts this way.
Color Staging
While it would be excessive to say that a good chart is a colorless chart, we might 
more reasonably say that a good chart is a staged-color chart.
Contrary to what an Internet image search may lead us to believe, a chart is not 
a pocket rainbow. And it’s useless to compare rainbow-colored charts to the 
idealized eﬀectiveness and rationality of grayscale charts. e answer lies in

the middle: Reasonable color management in a chart depends on the functional 
balance of color, its intensity, and its absence.
ere are two groups of objects in a chart: objects that encode the data (bars, lines, 
dots, areas) and objects that support and identify them (axes, grid lines, text, 
legend, background). ink of the former as the actors and the laer as the stage.
In addition to its strict role of helping to identify data-encoded objects,  the stage 
has an emotional quality that you can explore (the empty playground in Figure 
14.5, for example). However, we should not make use of this emotional dimension 
without clear justiﬁcation, and we must use it within reason. With or without 
justiﬁcation, the stage must always be forced to retreat into the background 
through variations in shades of gray, thereby giving prevalence to the represen-
tation of data (the actors).
Applying priorities as deﬁned in Chapter 6, but keeping this theatrical anal-
ogy, it’s also up to us, as directors of this play, to establish a subtler distinction 
among the actors—between leading, supporting, and extra roles. e extra roles 
are important as context but are not essential to the play. e extras oen don’t 
have names and can be encoded with gray. Two good extras candidates are the 
categories “Other” and “Do not know/No answer” used in market surveys.
Other cases depend on the message we want to convey. For example, in the chart 
in Figure 15.21, mozzarella, cheddar, and other American cheeses are highlighted 
as the main actors. Remaining merely as context, all other cheeses are included 
to add context. In an interactive chart, we could deﬁne a ﬁxed set of cheeses 
according to other criteria and highlight some others only when hovering the 
mouse over the line.
In another example (Figure 15.22), we wanted to emphasize that personal and 
family responsibilities are the key reasons that most distinguish men and women 
working at part-time jobs.
Except for the examples of bad chart choices, all charts in this book seek to apply 
functional color management, including the application of gray, creating reading 
levels that all charts should provide.

Color Harmony
From a functional point of view, colors per se don’t really maer, and if you can 
avoid strong symbolic meanings, it doesn’t maer if you pick them randomly. 
Data visualization deals with discriminating among visual stimuli, deﬁning their 
relationships, and establishing the intensity of these stimuli. e colors you pick 
just need to meet these requirements. Realizing this helps us overcome our fears 
of aesthetic catastrophe.
If you use color according to the principles we’ve discussed so far, it’s diﬃcult 
to believe that any catastrophe will happen. But it is equally unlikely that your 
chart will be remembered for your rare talent for selecting and combining colors. 
Is it possible to seek a comfortable balance somewhere between unappealing trash 
and something worthy of an art gallery? Can we make a chart more aractive 
even without the right artistic skills?
e answer is a clear “yes, but....” I do believe that color harmony is not tamable 
by rules and algorithms, nor is it possible to gi aesthetic sensibility to those who 
do not have it or do not cultivate it. But learning about the rules of color harmony 
can have a surprising eﬀect on the way we think about the message we want to 
convey and how our visualization brings it to life.
General Principles
Color harmony depends a lot on culture and individual subjectivity, so take these 
rules as suggestions and allow for potential variations according to the speciﬁc 
real-world situation.
It’s easier to choose colors if we ﬁnd a good starting point, and there are several 
ways to do this:
 
I
Symbolism. We’ve seen that if the audience associates colors with the data, 
we should at least ask ourselves whether there is any reason not to use 
those colors. For example, is it appropriate to diﬀerentiate data by gender in 
using blue and pink? Is it appropriate to use the colors of our organization?
 
I
Message tone. Is the message we want to convey positive or negative? If 
the former, we could use blue or green, while for the laer you may want 
to use red, and so on.
 
I
Standard palee. Before exploring the 16 million colors that your computer 
oﬀers, try a palee other than the soware’s default color palee. Excel 
2016 has 23 palees and room for creating many more.

The Classical Rules
If it’s true that color combinations are a result 
of the author’s very personal choices, it’s also 
true that some color choices create conﬂict, 
while others suggest similarities. If you map 
colors to a circle or a wheel, these chromatic 
relationships become apparent.
What’s really interesting is that there is an 
almost perfect overlap between chromatic  
relationships and data relationships: If you want 
to emphasize a certain kind of relationship, 
there is a matching rule of color harmony for 
that. For example, if you want to oppose two 
series, you’ll choose complementary colors, 
one from each side of the color wheel. You 
don’t even have to think about speciﬁc colors 
or hues. At this point, only positions in the 
color wheel maer.
e color wheel is like a ﬂat map that helps you 
familiarize yourself with the lay of the color 
space. But it’s a ﬂat map because it doesn’t 
take into account the other two dimensions 
of color, luminance and saturation. To man-
age chromatic stimuli, these dimensions will 
have to be factored in. Also, the color wheel 
provides a structure, but you must adjust it 
to your needs.
e color wheels in Figure 15.23 contain 12 hues 
and are formed by concentric rings, where the 
outer ring represents maximum saturation (255) 
and the standard luminance (128). e inner 
rings represent decreasing luminance levels 
in the ﬁrst wheel and decreasing saturation 
levels in the second wheel.

A close look at the outer ring shows that the pure hue can result either in an un-
necessary overstimulation or in an unjustiﬁed imbalance due to the diﬀerence 
in brightness. is must be compensated for, using the other dimensions of color.
e examples that follow illustrate the classical rules of color harmony. Each 
example shown includes a color wheel that deﬁnes the rule and three charts: one 
with the selected hues, a lighter one, and a darker one. e HSL code for each 
color is displayed below the legend.
Complementary Colors
Two complementary colors are located on opposite sides of the wheel (Figure 15.24). 
In the HSL model, the complementary hue h is h+128. e complementary hue 
to red (zero) is cyan (128).
Complementary colors send a message of opposition but also of balance. A chart 
with saturated complementary colors is an aggressively colored chart in which 
the colors ﬁght (equally) for their share of aention. Apply this rule when you 
intend to represent very distinct variables or those that for some reason you 
want to show as contrasting each other. Do not use complementary colors when 
variables have some form of continuity or order.
Split Complementary Colors
A particularly useful scheme for data visualization is the use of split comple-
mentary colors (Figure 15.25). In this case, direct color opposition is avoided. 
Instead, a less direct color opposition reduces the overall conﬂict while still 
creating distinct groups.
e example in Figure 15.25 is intended to establish an opposition between 
Germany, on one hand, and Spain and Greece, on the other.

Triadic Harmony
We create a triadic harmony by select- 
ing three equidistant points on the 
color wheel with a gap of 85 in hue 
(Figure 15.26). e triadic principle 
and its use are identical to the comple-
mentary colors, although less marked. 
As there is no sense of continuity, 
triadic harmony is suitable for rep-
resenting three distinct categories.
Analogous Colors
Analogous colors are those that are 
distant from each other by a maxi-
mum of 60 degrees (or 43 points on 
the scale 0–255) (Figure 15.27). e 
result is generally harmonious, but 
in some circumstances may suggest 
some continuity that does not exist.  
Analogous colors also suggest a content 
similarity where there is no reason 
to highlight one particular variable.
Rectangle
is is a variation of the split comple-
mentary rule in which two analogous 
colors are used on each side of the 
wheel (Figure 15.28). In this case, 
there is a clear distinction between 
two groups of categories.
In the chart, two groups of countries 
are in opposition: Germany and the 
U.S., on one hand, and Spain and 
Greece, on the other.

Warm Colors and 
Cool Colors
Another color scheme is related to the 
concept of color temperature; that is, 
warm and cool (Figure 15.29). ere is 
no objective way of dividing the color 
wheel into warm or cool colors, but 
generally you could consider red and 
the hues to the right as warm and blue 
and the hues to the right as cool. When 
you create a chart in which there is 
no opposition between series (or you 
do not want to create opposition), 
try choosing colors within one of the 
groups, warm or cool. You’ll be able 
to choose multiple color codes and 
avoid a sense of continuity.

Sources for Color Palettes
e examples on the previous pages show how easy it is to rec-
oncile the rules of color harmony to the type of message we 
want to convey. What they do not show is that it’s more diﬃcult 
to pick the color than to ﬁnd the HSL codes corresponding to  
each rule. You can choose, say, 20 as the value for hue, which 
means that the complementary color will be around 148. at’s 
easy. But you may need to do a lot of tweaking to ﬁnd the “right” 
(subjective) color codes.
Now that you’re familiar with rules of color harmony, you may 
want to leave the tweaking to others. Enter color palees.
Excel 
Color palees are designed to ensure harmony and balance of chro-
matic stimuli. ey help maintain visual coherence. Excel includes 
several predeﬁned color palees (Figure 15.30), and it’s easy to 
test them and to observe the impact on the visual representation. 
Unfortunately, if you inspect these predeﬁned color palees, you’ll 
conclude that most are not useful for data visualization, and you 
may prefer to create your own palees. Here’s why the existing 
palees are not useful:
 
I
Oﬃce palees. If we want to avoid the “Excel look,” it goes 
without saying that we can’t use the default palee of each 
Excel version.
 
I
Hue-named palees. We need a palee that is ﬂexible enough to diﬀer-
entiate categories using hues in multiple points of the color wheel, not in 
just a small section.
 
I
Luminance and saturation. e palees Median and Paper are too de-
saturated or too light.
 
I
Symbolic colors. e palee should provide quick access to colors close 
to red, green, blue, and yellow, since we oen need to use standard colors 
(think “traﬃc lights”). None of the other palees oﬀer that option.
e remaining palee, Grayscale, will be useful for testing purposes and in the 
unlikely event that the task actually requires it.

color palettes in Excel

palette shown at the top).

In an Excel color palee, there are text colors (you usually don’t change that) and 
six accent colors. In Figure 15.31, these colors are displayed in the top row. I applied 
the accents to each slice in the pie chart below. You can compare the results for 
each of the chosen palees.

e color palee I use as my default in Excel, and the one that has been used in 
most charts in this book, is the Chart Tamer palee (Figure 15.32). is palee 
was designed by color expert Maureen Stone in collaboration with Stephen Few 
and Andreas Lipphardt for an Excel add-in.⁵

Figure 15.33 shows Excel’s window for creating new palees by editing theme 
colors. In general, the colors are deﬁned as Accents 1 through 6. Once you’ve 
deﬁned the six accent colors, Excel displays ﬁve variations for each: three lighter 
and two darker.
5 Another expert in data visualization, Rolf Hichert, created his own custom palee. He has a page 
on his website where he speciﬁes the use of each color.

Beyond Excel
In most cases, creating a new palee doesn’t mean actually choosing each of the 
six colors, but simply importing palees made by experts. A good source to start 
with is ColorBrewer (Figure 15.34).
Although commonly used in maps, ColorBrewer palees are also used in charts. 
e website includes several useful options: number of colors, type of data 
(sequential, divergent, or qualitative, corresponding to three of our functional 
tasks of color), and conditioned to the type of use and user (such as detectable 
colors for color-blind people, detectable colors when printed or when photocopied).
 
Go to the  
web page
Figure 15.34 Choosing palettes in ColorBrewer 2.
To use a palee, take note of the RGB codes and create a new palee in Excel with 
these codes. (Search the website for information on whether using a ColorBrewer 
palee has any legal restrictions. You should at least mention your palee’s source.)

Go to the  
web page
If you’re feeling creative, you might explore Adobe Color CC (Figure 15.35). On the 
website, you can interact with a color wheel, choose the rule of color harmony 
you wish to begin with, manipulate the values, and evaluate the results.
Figure 15.35 Adobe Color CC.
Another way to generate a color palee on the Adobe Color CC website is by load-
ing an image you like and then composing the palee from there. When you’re 
satisﬁed, use the boom bar to take note of their RGB codes. 
Color Blindness
Except for the grayscale palee, all other palees in Figure 15.36 perform poorly 
when using colors in the ﬁrst row and testing for color blindness: Deuteranopia 
turns all colors into shades of green or purple.
Although color blindness is very restrictive when you want to color-code mul-
tiple categories, you can oen minimize its impact by varying luminance or by 
skipping color-coding all together.

If you do want to use color, you can check the results using a color blindness 
simulator like Color Oracle and test with diﬀerent levels of luminance.

Takeaways
 
I
Color use is inevitable, so we must ﬁnd ways to apply it eﬀectively to create 
a pleasant experience for the audience.
 
I
We can functionalize color (that is, seek color solutions that facilitate 
the reading of a graphical representation and that are independent of 
aesthetics) in four ways:
1.    Establish the functional tasks of color—that is, what kind of color usage 
is consistent with our data and the message we want to convey.
2.    Manipulate the intensity of chromatic stimuli. Variations of intensity 
reveal levels of data relevance.
3.    Take advantage of the symbolic nature of color and how we should inte-
grate it into our representations.
4.    Recognize the role of gray, which means utilizing the absence of color 
for creating context and minimizing noise.
 
I
Once color has been made functional, we stage color—that is, we create a 
graphical representation in which each of these prior four elements plays 
a role in structuring the message, and all four support a minimum frame-
work for using color safely.
 
I
e aesthetic and more subjective component of color can be made less 
complex by rules of color harmony.
 
I
Matching colors is diﬃcult. Even with the help of the rules of color harmony, 
we need additional aids, such as the use of appropriate palees in our 
graphical representations.

CONCLUSION
A data analyst and former coworker once asked me, with an ironic 
smile and half incredulously, whether data visualization was really 
a thing. It seemed strange to him that something as obvious as chart 
making could be a subject of study outside of learning how to make 
charts in an Excel training course.
For our business organization, trusting the numbers (the data) and 
having an intelligent discourse about them were essential qualities, 
and rightly so. As for charts, most people have never been required 
to present more than a few colorful slides in PowerPoint presenta-
tions. Some business organization rituals are like that.
www.ebook3000.com

16 I CONCLUSION
407
It’s All About Pragmatism, 
Not Aesthetics
I wrote this book thinking of those for whom charts represent the colorful moments 
of a presentation that can be useful for illustrating some numbers, assuming that 
their role ends there.
Aer reading this book, you must realize now that this way of looking at charts 
is only a cartoon-like view of the potential of data visualization. I’m sure you 
will not think in terms of “Your charts are preier than mine,” because none of 
this has to do with aesthetics, graphic design skills, or mastering the tools. Data 
visualization in a business organization represents a very pragmatic way of 
increasing the returns on investments made in the data. Furthermore, making some 
colorful charts just for fun means you’ll be leaving money on the table.
I quoted Stephen Few several times throughout this book. He likes to say that data 
visualization is not diﬃcult. Sure, it’s not rocket science, nor is it one of the ﬁne 
arts. Simple rules make data visualization more eﬀective, but it cannot be le to 
basic automated algorithms. Data visualization makes us see, but we need to know 
how to design the visualizations to help us see more clearly. If we design charts well, 
there is a good chance they’ll also be aesthetically pleasing (for a business context).
Say Goodbye to the Old Ways
We don’t use “data visualization” as a fancy synonym for “making charts,” just as 
“language” is not a synonym for “words.” Understanding this diﬀerence, and the 
importance given to eﬀectiveness when transmiing the message, is the ﬁrst step 
toward changing wrong assumptions, such as thinking that charts serve only (or 
mostly) to illustrate. Aer taking this step, it’s hard to go back.
I was recently ﬂipping through a report that contained several charts. It was obvi-
ous the authors had at least taken what I see as this ﬁrst step, demonstrated by the 
absence of pie charts and pseudo-3D eﬀects. (Pie charts and pseudo-3D eﬀects are 
certainly a couple of the worst sins against eﬀective data visualization.) However, 
I remain concerned that this may be the only part of the message received outside 
of the data visualization community. I’m also concerned that, stripped of these two 
mainstays of antiquated visual representations, people now feel lost between a 
world that is no longer theirs and another that they’re just beginning to explore.

DATA AT WORK
408
It’s likely that this has also happened to you, and that you have had the tempta-
tion to turn back. Don’t do it, please. at old comfort zone is illusory and ever 
narrower, because the data will make you face increasingly larger challenges.
Find Your Own Data 
Visualization Model
It’s imperative that you ﬁnd an alternative visualization model. One that makes 
you feel comfortable and through which you’re able to analyze the data and com-
municate your ﬁndings eﬀectively. is is something you have to do by yourself, 
depending on your tasks, your skills, your organization’s requirements, and the 
tools that it allows you to use.
You know, when people overvalue aesthetics it doesn’t maer much if they’re graphic 
designers or Excel users. e fact that one makes more aesthetically pleasing visualiza-
tions is irrelevant when the goal is to analyze data or communicate insights. Actually 
(and you may ﬁnd it strange to read this in a data visualization book), overvaluing 
aesthetics is a sign of overvaluing data visualization. Whatever level of data analyst 
you are, your starting point is not how to select or design the most pleasing visualiza-
tion for the data or the task. Your true starting point is to select a mix of tools (text, 
data, and visualizations) that best captures what the data have to say. For every task, 
for every step, there are always other options that you should consider.
In Business Visualization, 
Hard Work Is Not Always 
the Best Work
You might have smiled when I mentioned the path of least resistance in Chapter 2. 
at phrase is oen used as a synonym for laziness, when in fact it should be a 
synonym for eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency (beer charts that use fewer cognitive 
resources). I see no merit at all in hard work when it stems from process inef-
ﬁciencies and a lack of curiosity for ﬁnding new solutions. Constructing the 
visualization model should be subordinate to providing preprocessed stimuli 
that allow one to think and not be overwhelmed with tasks that can be simpli-
ﬁed or outsourced.
www.ebook3000.com

16 I CONCLUSION
409
When emphasizing eﬀectiveness, we’re also emphasizing more intelligent data 
management, regardless of its volume. roughout this book, you probably cor-
rectly read hundreds of values in several charts, without all those values interfering 
with your reasoning. On the other hand, you might have also found it rather dif-
ﬁcult, beginning with Chapter 1, to address some questions whose answers were 
hidden in a bad chart that contained only a few data points.
Organizational Literacy
e most diﬃcult thing is not understanding or even creating your visualization 
style. Rather, the hardest thing is selling your style to your organization. When 
the organization’s visualization culture is shaped by Microso tools, you can 
hardly blame managers for whom visualization is not relevant in the decision-
making process.
Low graphical literacy is common and stems from a lack of awareness as well as 
from training that focuses much too narrowly on how to use the tools, praising 
the soware features no maer how silly and removed from basic visualization 
principles these features are. is can be internalized in such a way that people 
refuse to recognize their low graphical literacy as a problem. Fortunately, most 
of the time, simple inertia is the real culprit.
By understanding the limits of the organization’s visualization culture, you can 
initiate change by selling the beneﬁts of your visualizations to top management, 
showing clearly and systematically the advantages of a model based on eﬀec-
tiveness rather than on models of useless eﬀects. Changing the organizational 
culture is diﬃcult and takes time, so converting one person at a time might be a 
reasonable goal. But the change begins with you. Design more eﬀective versions 
of your charts, or practice by trying to improve some of the charts in this book. 
Clearly explain why the new versions are beer.
Reason and Emotion
I hope it has become clear to you throughout the book that many of the issues 
debated by diﬀerent experts in data visualization are associated with the eternal 
conﬂict between emotion and reason. Some experts claim that eﬀectiveness 
should be measured by the interest that the chart awakens through its format 
and aesthetics (because an uninteresting chart that nobody reads is useless). 
Others say that emphasizing aesthetics is just fool’s gold, and that any sub-optimal 

DATA AT WORK
410
design choice not only endangers the eﬀectiveness of chart reading but can lead 
to biases in understanding the message.
Both of these positions are legitimate, and neither has a monopoly on truth. Finding 
the balance between the two is always more interesting, but from a business 
visualization perspective, your starting point should be based in reason: Seek to 
make justiﬁable and rational design choices and, from there, move (minimally) 
in the opposite direction to add an emotional component that frames the visual-
ization without distorting it (for example, in the spirit of the law of least eﬀort, 
a chart title that summarizes the main conclusions is more aractive than one 
that merely describes its content).
Play with Constraints
To force change, impose some restrictions on yourself in the way you visualize 
data. Try some of these exercises:
 
I
Avoid pie charts or pseudo-3D eﬀects if you cannot justify them (and “My 
manager likes them” doesn’t count).
 
I
Reduce your chart to a minimum readable size. (It would be a good idea to 
test its readability on a smartphone.)
 
I
Create small multiples when you have many series.
 
I
Limit the number of colors in your chart to three.
 
I
Find examples for which the logarithmic scale is useful.
 
I
Design a dashboard.
 
I
Create a useful chart with more than 100 series.
 
I
Get data from your internal business intelligence (BI), and structure the 
data in order to create an interactive chart from a pivot table.
 
I
Test your charts’ readability for color-blind people.
 
I
Find an article with a lot of numbers but no charts, and try to draw charts 
that support the text (or perhaps that contradict it).
Create more interesting challenges by combining several of these suggestions. 
Always compare your results with those that would have been obtained through 
the usual old process.

16 I CONCLUSION
411
The Tools
One last word about tools. I would not have planned this book the way I did if I 
did not believe that access to a spreadsheet application is suﬃcient for under-
standing what data visualization is all about. I also believe that we can move from 
Excel charts to Excel visualizations by improving graphical literacy with only a 
marginal cost for the organization.
It’s easy for you to use Excel for all your data analysis tasks, knowing that you 
can share ﬁles with colleagues, customers, and suppliers, creating a predictable 
information ﬂow.
is Excel ecosystem creates a comfort zone that’s hard to escape, permeating the 
organizational culture and thwarting alternatives that may be diﬃcult to assess. 
As we discussed, tools are not neutral, and the Excel monoculture tends to force 
analytical perspectives of the data that are simple to apply using a spreadsheet. 
is does not mean that they’re the most appropriate for the organization.
Ideally, a graphical representation should be designed depending only on business 
goals and needs. Some characteristics of the chart can be adjusted to the nature 
of the tool without altering the end result. Other characteristics, however, are 
incompatible with the soware application, and the organization must decide 
whether it can dismiss these particular goals and needs, or whether an invest-
ment in another application is justiﬁed.
In any event, I suggest that you familiarize yourself with data visualizations 
made with tools other than Excel. Just search online for data visualizations done 
in Tableau, SAP Lumira, or QlikView, or programming languages like R, Python, 
or D3. If you are reluctant to leave the Microso umbrella, try PowerBI.
ere is much to do in data visualization. ere is much to research, and there is a 
lot of data to discover or even rediscover. I’m sure that aer having read this book, 
you will be less tolerant of certain cartoon visualizations that distort, lie, babble 
with incomprehensible fragments, or merely waste your time. I’m conﬁdent that 
you will participate in this discovery process as a professional and as a citizen.
