About the Technical 
Reviewer
Dr. Peter Meyers is a cognitive psychologist 
and the resident marketing scientist at Moz, a 
Seattle-based search marketing software com-
pany. He spent the past four years building 
research tools to monitor Google and trying to 
understand how the internet impacts the way 
we consume information, share content, and ulti-
mately make decisions.

Prologue: Memetic 
Fitness
In this series of essays, we seek a better understanding of why some digital 
innovations and experiences engage us deeply and spread widely, and why 
others do not, drawing upon the lessons of 100 years of psychological science.
Our fundamental assertion is this: digital innovations must survive the psy-
chological bottlenecks of attention, perception, memory, disposition, motivation, and 
social-influence if they are to proliferate. Our receptivity to your inventions in 
this way determines whether we engage with them and recommend them to 
others—or not.
Who are we? We are your customers, your users, and your audience. You are 
entrepreneurs, designers, developers, publishers, and advertisers. This series 
is only worth reading if we can talk with you directly in a first-person plural 
voice. But this is the usability feedback you always dreamed of, because we are 
also dedicated students of psychology. Perhaps you were too busy coding in 
your dorm room or even dropping out to raise venture funding to fully digest 
this body of theory. But if you read on, it’s because you now realize that our 
psychological receptivity to your offerings is the difference between success 
and failure. For just as chemistry is the science behind good cooking, psychol-
ogy is the science behind good design.
The key lesson of this piece is that our nervous systems are radically bottle-
necked, and the retinae of our eyes are only the first of several constrictions. 
Our capacity for memes is wide and deep, but it is filled through a tiny pipette, 
one at a time. We are built this way for our protection. We can’t afford to 
have our brains colonized by memes that take more than they give. Offsetting 
the sheer number of memes in the information age is our supremely adapted 
ability to ignore things that, in our words, suck. Our psychological bottlenecks 
are simultaneously the challenge you must overcome to succeed and our pro-
tection from exploitation.
■
■Key Point  Who are we? We are your customers, your users, and your audience. You are 
entrepreneurs, designers, developers, publishers, and advertisers. This series is only worth reading 
if we can talk with you directly in a first-person plural voice.

Prologue: Memetic Fitness
xiv
So let’s begin. A meme, if we may define it properly for you, is an idea, an 
invention, a particle of culture ranging from the simplest to the most com-
plex, whose diffusion through a population can be observed. You are probably 
familiar with this word, but its original meaning went far beyond LOL cats and 
political gaffes to encompass almost everything you are involved in creating. 
The term was born in this 1976 passage by sociobiologist Richard Dawkins, 
which is worth reading in detail:
[A]ll life evolves by the differential survival of replica-
ting entities. The gene, the DNA molecule, happens 
to be the replicating entity that prevails on our own 
planet. There may be others. If there are, provided 
certain other conditions are met, they will almost 
inevitably tend to become the basis for an evolutio-
nary process…
I think that a new kind of replicator has recently emer-
ged… The new soup is the soup of human culture. 
We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that 
conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or 
a unit of imitation. “Mimeme” comes from a suitable 
Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds 
a bit like gene. I hope my classicist friends will for-
give me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme… Examples 
of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes 
fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches. 
Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool 
by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs, so 
memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by 
leaping from brain to brain via a process that, in the 
broad sense, can be called imitation. i
Endowing the term meme with the weight that Dawkins intended (he went 
on to discuss the memes of entire religions),ii we will use it to refer to any 
invention or work product in whose proliferation you are invested. This may 
be your app, your web site, your bot, your game, your blog, your design, your 
interface, your tweet, your newsletter, your movie, your book, your song. All 
the ads, logos, charts, infographics, tools, reports, spreadsheets, and “solutions” 
you’ve ever made for your company or your clients. Include too your digital 
identity, your posts, your pictures, your dating profile, and your résumé.
In the past, few of you could afford to spread your memes through the scarce 
and expensive communications channels like TV, radio, recording studios, and 
publishing houses. The bottlenecks were in media then, but not anymore. 
Because the internetiii reaches us all and launching memes through it is easy 
and inexpensive, it has not only devalued the old broadcast channels, but it has 
caused an explosion of content. Look at just one platform, smartphone apps, 

Prologue: Memetic Fitness
xv
where by 2015 there were 1.6 million apps on Google Play, 1.4 million in the 
Apple App Store, and by some estimates, over 9 million apps and web sites 
on the Facebook Developer Platform.iv This has pushed the bottlenecks out 
to us, the end users, whose nervous systems must play a much larger role in 
separating the meaning from the noise.
But history, even ancient history, has repeatedly witnessed such explosions 
of innovation, and scholars are quite familiar with what happens as they run 
their course. Studying early multicellular life in ancient shale fossils, archae-
ologist Stephen Jay Gould described what he called the Cambrian explo-
sion. This was a brief period 570 million years ago when evolution burst 
forth with the most numerous, interesting, fancy, and bizarre animal phyla our 
planet has ever seen (Figure I). “This was a time of unparalleled opportunity.” 
Gould wrote, “Nearly anything could find a place. Life was radiating into empty 
space and could proliferate at logarithmic rates…in a world virtually free of 
competition.”v
But what happened shortly afterward? Most phyla promptly went extinct, 
except the few vertebrates and arthropods we know today. Gould argued 
that those that survived made it through key ecological bottlenecks, whereas 
most did not.
Fast forward to the Facebook epoch, and Cameron Marlow, who pioneered 
Facebook’s data science team, referred to the same Cambrian explosion to 
describe the history of apps on the Facebook platform (Figure  2).vi Mere 
months after this niche opened in 2007, developers launched hundreds of 
Figure 1. An example of an early phyla in the Cambrian explosion that later went extinct.

Prologue: Memetic Fitness
xvi
thousands of apps and games on it. But almost as quickly as they were cre-
ated, most “died” for lack of attention and use, and only a few proliferated and 
dominated.
Gould may have been looking at prehistoric sea bugs, but he saw a larger 
pattern when he noted that “rapid establishment and later decimation domi-
nates all scales, and seems to have the generality of a fractal pattern.”vii Indeed, 
history has shown this metapattern to be true of the early World Wide 
Web (ultimately dominated by AOL, Yahoo!, and Lycos), social networking 
(Facebook), productivity suites (Microsoft Office), blog platforms (Wordpress), 
music streaming (iTunes), video streaming (YouTube), messaging apps (Skype, 
WeChat), and smartphone operating systems (Android, Apple).viii As such, 
there is every reason to expect that “rapid establishment and later decima-
tion” will be repeated among the platforms that are just emerging: bots and 
chatbots on messaging and voice platforms, in-car infotainment systems, the 
internet of things, and augmented-reality content.
This is why you must understand your users, and the psychological bottle-
necks we employ to ensure that we expend our time and energy only on 
useful memes. The memes that are optimized for receptivity will go on to 
Figure 2. The explosion of apps on the Facebook platform.

Prologue: Memetic Fitness
xvii
dominate, while those that are misaligned with human nature will be selected 
against and ultimately go extinct, suffering the silent, ignored death of most 
digital inventions.
Dawkins’ analogy, that memes are to culture as genes are to heredity, also 
helps to understand why you put so much effort into your inventions, and 
what your essential challenge is. You likely already know what it means to 
strive for genetic fitness: spreading your genes through the population by 
amassing resources, attracting a mate, raising offspring, and caring for rela-
tives. Dawkins’ analogy suggests that you work just as hard to maximize your 
memetic fitness: spreading your inventions through the culture by attracting 
attention, retaining it, and encouraging your audience to pass the word. You 
cultivate your fitness in two separate ecologies like a gambler playing at two 
tables. In a digital age, fitness may be defined as much by fame as by family, and 
you make that choice with how you allocate every hour of your day.
But there is yet another, often overlooked, way by which Dawkins’ idea of 
memes helps to understand the diffusion of innovation. His notion packetizes 
your inventions into parcels of energy and meaning, just the way genes pack-
etized our understanding of heritable traits. This helps enormously in tracing 
the transmission of your work, just as it helped to trace the transmission of 
genes from parent to offspring.
As such, in this piece we will conceptually follow your meme as it leaves a 
screen and hits the eye, penetrates a brain, is imbued with meaning, and is 
retained and used—or alternatively—overlooked, discarded, and abandoned. 
We will explore the forces that determine whether your meme matches our 
dispositions and meets our needs and is ultimately recommended to others—
or is irrelevant, a disappointment, and detracted from mercilessly in our online 
comments. Ultimately, the survival of your meme through these bottlenecks is 
what determines your memetic fitness and whether your work will leap “from 
brain to brain” and across the globe.
■
■Key Point  Digital innovations must survive the psychological bottlenecks of attention, 
perception, memory, disposition, motivation, and social-influence if they are to proliferate. Just 
as chemistry is the science behind good cooking, psychology is the science behind good design.
If the bottlenecked user is our fundamental assertion, then our fundamental 
assumption is that there exist many good memes worth spreading that fail 
due to avoidable misalignments with our nervous systems. We are not talking 
about all the buggy apps and ranting blogs that we kill off quickly with “user-
selection” before they can make further demands on our attention. We’re 
talking about the myriad of fundamentally viable memes that, through some 
shortcoming or flaw in their design, fail to pass through the bottlenecks that 

Prologue: Memetic Fitness
xviii
we use to block out the noise. If you are the author of a truly useful meme, 
by the end of this series you will learn many concrete ways to improve your 
work so that we are more receptive to it.
But we offer you our thoughts without altruism. The memes that you build 
make up the digital tools and environments we use to do our own life’s work, 
provide for ourselves and our loved ones, connect with our peers, and enjoy 
the creativity of others or express our own creativity. Your memes undergird 
our mortal existence from birth to death. Only when your business goals 
satisfy our life goals will success be assured and mutual.
If nothing else, we hope to evoke both innovative new directions in design and 
fruitful hypotheses for research. Where we have permission, we will refer to 
actual research studies that we’ve participated in, sometimes commissioned 
by tech giants, other times by start-ups, but always on issues where the stakes 
were high. And to other users like us, we point out that a meme carrier can 
instantly become a meme creator, so any of us who has ever tried to raise 
awareness for anything, from a college app to a killer app, stands to learn from 
this exercise as well.
With That, We Organized this Book as Follows
If your meme successfully passes through…

Dawkins, R. (1976). cont. “Consider the idea of God. We do not 
know how it arose in the meme pool. Probably it originated 
many times by independent ’mutation’. In any case, it is very old 
indeed. How does it replicate itself? By the spoken and written 
word, aided by great music and great art. Why does it have such 
high survival value? Remember that ’survival value’ here does 
not mean value for a gene in a gene pool, but value for a meme 
in a meme pool. The question really means: What is it about 
the idea of a god that gives it its stability and penetrance in the 
cultural environment? The survival value of the god meme in 
the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal.”

Foveal Acuity
You worked hard to digitize your ideas and send them our way in the form of 
light and sound. But they must be encoded into neural impulses for your app 
to work and your business model to succeed. From a business perspective, a 
meme that never enters a brain is the tree that falls in the proverbial empty 
forest—it doesn’t exist.
To cross the organic boundary into our nervous systems, the first require-
ment is that it must fall in our line of sight. That statement may be painfully 
obvious to you, but it is an even bigger pain point for us. Your meme will fail 
if the light from it only reaches our peripheral vision where we can neither 
read nor see color.
Several billion-dollar examples instantly leap to mind: navigating while driving, 
video calling, and seeing display ads on web sites. To illustrate, most if not all 
of the point-of-interest icons designed for this dashboard navigational display 
are difficult or impossible to be seen or appreciated while driving (Figure 1-1). 
It was someone’s job (maybe yours) to make these memes, like the hamburger 
icon, or Korean, Italian, and American flags for different ethnic restaurants, but 
they may never actually enter a driver’s brain in the moment when they might 
be of use.

Consider closely the back wall of our eyeballs and you’ll understand what 
you’re up against. Our retinae have a lot of neurons to catch the light, but 
the cone-shaped neurons that let us see color and the detailed edges of 
characters are concentrated in one tiny area, called the fovea, which is oppo-
site our pupils (Figure 1-2).i Our fovea are amazingly sensitive when we point 
them your way: we can detect whether or not you’re holding a quarter from 
90 yards off. But if we’re looking just to the right or left of you, our acuity 
plummets to only 30% of what it is when we look straight at you. A little fur-
ther off, our acuity drops to 10%.ii
Figure 1-1.  Dashboard display.

What that means for your meme is that we cannot read it if we’re looking a 
mere six degrees to the left or right. At the typical distance to a screen, we’re 
blind to symbolic information a mere five characters away from where we are 
focused. Stare at the period at the end of this sentence and count the number 
of words you can make out past it. Not too many. Perhaps we could read your 
meme in our peripheral vision if you increased your font size. But you’d have 
to increase it 400% if we’re looking six degrees off, 3000% if we’re looking 20 
degrees off, and 9000% if we’re looking 30 degrees off. Good luck doing that 
on a smartphone screen or a dashboard display.
■
■Key Point  Your meme will fail if the light from it only reaches our peripheral vision, where we 
can neither read nor see color.
But even useful memes are impeded by our anatomy if they are not designed 
in harmony with it. For example, many human-factors experts consider video 
calling to be among the slowest-spreading meme in the history of tech inven-
tions (Figure 1-3). We’ve had video calling technology longer than we’ve had 
microwave ovens or camcorders. And yet, while the penetration of those 
other inventions is all but complete in developed markets, as are other forms 
of communication like texting, still only a fraction of us use video calling daily 
or monthly, if at all.

Why would this be? Many factors could be to blame, but the 20 degree offset 
or more between webcams and the eyes of the person we are talking with 
might be one. Because no one yet has invented a webcam, native or peripheral, 
that sits right behind the monitor, only on top or to the side of it, we never get 
to look directly into the gaze of our friends and family members while we talk 
(Figure 1-4). Nor do they look into ours, because to do so, we’d both have to 
look directly into the cameras, at which point we could no longer make out 
each other’s faces. The problem persists even on smaller devices because our 
foveal acuity is so narrow (Figure 1-5).

Thus we’ve had face-to-face calling for over 85 years, but never quite eye-to-eye 
calling. The best that the top video-calling applications have ever given us is 
a view of our friends’ eyes looking away from us as we look at them (although 
interestingly, their ads never show it this way). This mismatch with human 
nature has proved to have a very slow rate of adoption, far slower than voice-
to-voice calling did before it.

Or consider ads on web sites. By 2016, U.S. companies alone were spending 
over $30 billion on internet display ads,vi over half of which didn’t display on 
a screen long enough to be viewable (half of their pixels were rendered for 
less than a second).vii And of those that did, a vast majority were hitting our 
peripheral retina, where we can’t make them out as we read the content 
elsewhere on the page. We need only point our fovea five characters to the 
left or right, doing whatever it is we came to do, and your ads were lost on 
us. Let the sheer waste of that and the lack of ROI sink in as a result of this 
incredibly powerful psychological bottleneck. Not to mention the inaccuracy 
of reach statistics, which only measure whether the ad was queried from a 
server, ignoring whether it landed on a fovea, or even a peripheral retina. This 
is not the path to memetic fitness, let alone marketing success and profitability.
And then there are our cars, the next big battleground for tech dominance. 
Whoever prevails in this context must find design solutions to accommodate 
the fact that we must point our fovea forward out of the windshield while 
we drive. This is because our fovea are also required for depth perception, 
something our peripheral vision is incapable of, and thus many states man-
date we keep them on the stop-and-go traffic ahead. The problem is that you 
need to rethink the traditional monitor. Positioned currently where the radio 
traditionally sits, or on a smartphone held in a driver’s hand, it is so far away 
from our foveal vision that we expose ourselves to real danger in trying to 
view any of your memes shown there (Figure 1-6). In a 2014 report, the U.S. 
National Transportation Safety Board listed “visual” and “manual” distractions 
on their “most wanted list” of critical changes to reduce accidents and save 
lives (in addition to “cognitive” distractions, which we’ll return to later). They 
specifically referenced “the growing development of integrated technologies 
in vehicles” and its potential to contribute to “a disturbing growth in the num-
ber of accidents due to distracted operators”.viii

Certainly, if self-driving cars proliferate, then the entire interior of cars can be 
redesigned and turned into a media room or a productivity center (which will 
spark its own platform for competing memes). The speed by which this tech-
nology proliferates will depend on the incidence of fatal crashes, like the 2016 
accident by a self-driving Tesla, and on whether drivers will legally be allowed 
to let their attention wander.x
But for those of us who continue to drive, whether out of economics or the 
pace of change, our retinal anatomy would predict that our windshields will 
become our monitors, where your digital memes will be displayed. Clearly, they 
must not compete with the things we need to see outside the car, but instead 
augment them. The first memes to warrant display on windshields will make

windshield.ix

road hazards like falling rocks and crossing deer more visible, forewarn us of 
tight curves, and signal slowdowns in traffic. After the first wave of safety memes 
is established, next will come convenience memes: those that enhance street 
signs and outline upcoming freeway exits. Finally, with a considerable testing, 
providing jobs for memetic engineers, the third wave of commercial memes will 
arise on our windshields: digital billboards pointing the way to gas stations and 
restaurants, specially adapted for the windshield. Commercial logos have been 
displayed on GPS units and “heads-up” displays already for some time; maybe 
on windshields they will finally hit our fovea and enter our brains.
Is there a limit to the content that can be projected on a windshield? Of course 
there is. But scarcity is the foundation of value, so this only drives up the price 
for a placement. How can legislators help? Not by banning windshield displays 
altogether, but by establishing a data-driven regulatory agency, in the United 
States perhaps under the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) or 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which approves 
memes like the FDA approves drugs. Broadly, windshield memes must be 
shown empirically to…
• 
Increase drivers’ safety, not imperil it
• 
Improve our driving, not impair it
• 
Augment reality, not distract from it
As you see, our psychological constrictions matter, starting with the nerves 
in our eyeballs. But this is only the beginning, since our attentional capacity is 
just as laser-thin.

Task Orientation
To place your meme precisely where we will be directing our fovea, and thus 
our attention, the first idea that likely occurs to you is to “learn our goals” 
and you would not be wrong. “Goals serve a directive function,” psycholo-
gists Locke and Latham wrote in 2002, summarizing 35 years of research on 
the topic. “[T]hey direct attention and effort toward goal-relevant activities 
and away from goal-irrelevant activities.”i But we want you to take a step 
back even from that. The first thing you must do is learn whether or not we 
even have a goal. If we do, then any meme that interrupts us will be ignored 
as a frustrating distraction. If we do not, we will be receptive to unsolicited 
and unexpected memes, although we will resist any effortful concentration 
required to engage with you.
■
■Key Point  To meet our goals as users of your meme, the first thing you must do is learn 
whether or not we even have a goal.
In 1991, psychologists were given a research instrument as important to them 
as the telescope was to Galileo: functional magnetic resonance imagery. fMRI 
allowed them to see small changes in cerebral blood flow as we think or feel 
different things. For the first time, neuroscientists could examine the brain 
while we were awake and alive rather than anaesthetized or dead. So they 
began asking us to perform specific tasks to learn which areas of the brain 
were responsible for executing them.

Chapter 2 | Task Orientation
14
By 2014, Daniel Levitin, a neuroscientist on the front lines of the imaging revo-
lution, summarized “one of the biggest neuroscientific discoveries of the last 
twenty years.”ii This was the existence of two fundamental patterns of activity 
in the cortex: the task-positive network and the task-negative network 
(Figure 2-1). According to Levitin…
the task-positive network is
“the state you’re in when you’re intensely focused on 
a task such as doing your taxes, writing a report, or 
navigating through an unfamiliar city. This stay-on-task 
mode is… [one] dominant mode of attention, and it 
is responsible for so many high-level things we do that 
researchers have named it ‘the central executive.’”
the task-negative network is
“the mind-wandering mode…a special brain network 
that supports a more fluid and nonlinear mode of thin-
king…[in which] thoughts seem to move seamlessly 
from one to another, there’s a merging of ideas, visual 
images, and sounds of past, present, and future.”

15

Essentially, fMRI studies showed first that no matter what problem they asked 
us to solve or task they asked us to perform, a similar network of pathways 
was activated. This was the task-positive network, including the pre-frontal, 
medial, and occipital lobes and other loci involved in processing language, sym-
bols, and mental models.

Chapter 2 | Task Orientation
16
The task-negative network was discovered more or less by accident, according 
to neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman.iv During most neuroimaging sessions, 
the researchers didn’t slide us in and out of the fMRI between tasks, but 
instead, they left us in there with the machine running. During the downtime, 
when we were listening to the hum of the electromagnets and solving no 
specific problem, the task-negative network appeared in our brains, and it too 
was remarkably consistent in its pattern. Our brains were defaulting to a state 
in which the medial areas deep in our cortex were at work as well as the hip-
pocampus. When asked what we were thinking about, we typically replied we 
were daydreaming, remembering, and pondering over social situations.
Just like the functioning of our hearts and our kidneys, neuroscientists realized 
that there is no resting state for the brain. We are either solving an advanced 
symbolic problem like only our species can, or daydreaming to consolidate 
memories, see new connections, and try to understand the people around us.
As an inventor and promoter of digital media and experiences, your first 
objective is to understand whether we come to you in a task-positive or a 
task-negative mindset.
This is precisely what Allrecipes.com did, the largest community cooking 
web site in the world (Figure 2-2). They fielded a survey via a popup window 
with one question:
If you had to choose just one, which statement 
below best describes your visit today?
• 
I had a specific goal. I knew what I was looking for or 
hoping to accomplish.
• 
I did not have a specific goal. I was exploring and just 
looking for interesting information rather than something 
specific.

Bottlenecks
17
Allrecipes.com found that about 73% of us were task-positive and 27% 
were task-negative (Figure  2-2). As task-positive users, we were trying to 
make progress toward a known outcome, and so we wanted to be efficient 
and productive. We might be trying to figure out, for example, how to make 
a pomegranate reduction sauce for a lamb roast. As task-negative users, we 
were passing time, open to ideas, and just being a part of the community. We 
might be, say, getting new ideas in advance of a holiday, triggering memories of 
dishes we once loved but forgot, or looking to see what others were talking 
about.
But the more important lesson that Allrecipes learned was that task-positive 
and task-negative visitors used totally different navigation features of their 
site (Figure 2-3). Task-positive users among us tended to use a search field. 
This was attentionally the most economical way for us to get our reward. By 
contrast, task-negative users tended to browse the body of the site, clicking 
the pictures, links, and graphics in the hope that we would discover what we 
didn’t know enough to search for.
The realization that most of its users were task-positive helped Allrecipes.com 
make much smarter decisions about which features to invest in. They knew 
they had to have a very smart search algorithm and excellent search returns, 
since the majority of their users were task-positive. However, they could not 
ignore the minority who were task-negative and clicking links and going down 
rabbit holes, because these viewers were spending more time on the site and 
loading a lot more pages and hence more ads.

Allrecipes understood also that the mix of task-positive and task-negative 
users on their site was a function of their acquisition strategy. At the time 
this survey was conducted, Allrecipes engaged primarily in search marketing, 
and so the majority of us were coming in from Google. This predisposed us 
to being task-positive. We knew what we were looking for and we had begun 
looking for it well before arriving on Allrecipes’ domain. But later, Allrecipes 
put out a print magazine at the checkout aisle in grocery stores. This helped 
bring in more task-negative users who weren’t looking for anything in particu-
lar, but just wanted to browse cooking content. Balancing out the mix of task-
orientation of their users with their acquisition marketing was an important 
way for Allrecipes to both meet our needs and overtake Foodnetwork.com 
as the largest global cooking community.

In essence, when we are in a task-positive mode, we point our fovea where 
we consciously choose to, in the service of trying to reach our goals, and 
we actively avoid everything else, which we treat as an unwanted distraction. 
If a majority of your users are oriented this way, as with many productivity 
platforms (Microsoft Office, Slack), you should avoid ad-support as a business 
model and instead steer toward a subscription model. If you display any ads at 
all, only do so in search results, because interstitial ads will perform poorly and 
be an annoyance. Your essential design strategy is to help us find what we’re 
looking for. Discard the thinking that, “if you build it, we will come” in favor of, 
“learn where we’re looking and be waiting.”
But the strategy reverses when we are in a task-negative mode. Now we 
welcome the attentional intrusions, including advertisements, and we resist 
expending the effort and concentration needed to solve things. If you’re build-
ing a mind-wandering app or web site like Flipboard, Reddit, Funnyordie, and 
most news aggregators, fill the real estate with thumbnails, headlines, and links, 
and load this content endlessly as we scroll down so there is effectively no 
end to the page. (This is the place for “if you build it, we will come” thinking.) 
Use machine learning to suggest content that is similar in category as what 
we’ve previously clicked (e.g., sports, election coverage). Adopt a social-mar-
keting strategy where you post this same content elsewhere on the web. If 
you do use search marketing, optimize to search terms that are more general 
(e.g., “holiday recipes”) and less specific (e.g., “balsamic reduction sauce.”). In 
your own interface or on your own domain, do not in any way puzzle us with 
difficult navigation, advanced search forms, lengthy registrations, or anything 
that would require task-positive mental effort. On these sites you should fol-
low the advice of usability guru Steve Krug and “don’t make us think.”vi
The neuroscientist Daniel Levitin writes of the task-positive and task-negative 
modes, “These two brain states form a kind of yin-yang: When one is active, 
the other is not.” Thus to survive this bottleneck, learn when and how often 
we are in each mode and adapt your design accordingly.vii

Attentional 
Focus
Given that our foveal acuity is as narrow as a laser, the first monetizable event 
in the attention economy is when we point it toward your meme to the 
exclusion of all others. You must understand this as an economic transaction: 
in the face of endless informational demands, we allocate the scarce resource 
of foveal acuity and attention in the way we hope will be the most reward-
ing. The instant we flex our orbital muscles and look, we become customers 
to digital advertisers, publishers, and developers like you. And as we begin to 
consume your memes, you can begin to monetize our attention.
Psychologists have known since the 1960s that goals determine the direction 
of our gaze. In one experiment in 1967, Yarbus showed us the painting titled 
“Unexpected Visitors” by Ilya Repin and asked us to guess the ages of the 
characters.i This is where we looked (Figure 3-1).

Chapter 3 | Attentional Focus
22
But when he asked us to determine how rich everyone is, this is where we 
looked (Figure 3-2).
Figure 3-1.  Eye gaze when guessing age. Adapted from Yarbus (1967).
Figure 3-2.  Eye gaze when guessing material circumstances. Adapted from Yarbus (1967).

Bottlenecks
23
And when Yarbus asked us to guess how long the unexpected visitor had 
been away, this is where we looked (Figure 3-3).
No question, we voluntarily direct our gaze to different elements of a meme 
depending on our informational goals.
The same is true when looking at most content, social media, and storefront 
web sites. As always, our objective is to grasp the meaning of the page with the 
least allocation of attentional resources. As such, we tend to scan such pages 
in a F-shaped pattern, as discovered by usability expert Jakob Nielsen in 
2006. We concentrate our gaze at the top-left corner and penetrate into the 
body to read (Figure 3-4). The headline at the top usually meets our miserly 
goals the best, so that’s where we look the most, but if we aren’t satisfied, we 
read lines lower down, hence the F-shape. The F-shape is reversed for lan-
guages like Hebrew and Arabic, written right to left, which proves this pattern 
is a function of our goals.

Yarbus (1967).

Chapter 3 | Attentional Focus
24
So, the attentional bottleneck isn’t a round pinhole; when you account for 
common eye movements, it’s shaped like a capital F. What this means for your 
design, if by chance we’re the first to tell you, is that on most web sites with 
left-to-right languages, the lower-right corner is an attentional desert. We just 
don’t focus our attention there very often. We recommend you never put 
any critical navigational links there, and unfortunately any ads you place there 
won’t perform very well either. They won’t pass through the bottleneck of 
gaze. Interestingly, if you try to offset our tendency to ignore that area with 
brighter colors, it will actually backfire: we’ll simply think it’s another ad on 
which we should waste no attention. In general, it’s a good idea to design to 
the F-shaped pattern; you have to have a really good reason to fight against 
our expectations. Put important links across the top and down the left spine; 
use a headline. What should you put in no-man’s land? Maybe just whitespace.
■
■Key Point  On most web sites with left-to-right languages, the lower-right corner is an 
attentional desert.
What happens when our information goals are flat out unmet on a web page 
and we simply cannot find what we’re looking for? The F-shaped gaze pat-
tern gives way to one big blob of hunting around. But there is something you 
should learn from our desperate search: it proceeds in three distinct phases.
A usability study of the Washington State unemployment statistics site illus-
trated this nicely. We participated in the study during the Great Recession 
of 2009 when everyone wanted to find job openings. Our task was simply to 
locate the link that would lead us to them on the site shown in Figure 3-5, 
which is how it appeared prior to the re-design.
Figure 3-4.  Gaze dwell times shown as “heatmaps” reveal an F-shaped pattern. From 
Nielsen (2006).ii

Bottlenecks
25
We began our search in the efficient F-shape, hunting by location more so 
than by graphics or text (phase one). Unrewarded, we changed our gaze pat-
tern to instead scrutinize all of the icons and other graphics on the page 
(phase two). Still not finding it, we changed our strategy again, now reading 
every word of every link on the page (phase three). This hierarchical process 
is very similar to how psychologists believe we read most text: we scan entire 
blocks of words first, and if we don’t comprehend the meaning, we look at 
words themselves, and if we still don’t comprehend, we look at characters.iii
On the Washington State unemployment site before the re-design, the best 
two links to find jobs were those labeled “Job Seekers” and “Occupation 
Explorer.” But they were both located on the right side rather than the left, 
and low enough to be dangerously close to the attentional desert. Good 
graphics and better word choice would have helped, to be sure, but so would 
placement on the page.
Interviews with participants in the study confirmed that we were unable 
to find our information using the efficient F-shaped scan. Instead, the layout 
forced us all the way to phase-three link-reading, and therefore extracted the 
maximal attentional cost from us. Our gaze dwelled for many seconds on 
Figure 3-5. Washington State employment statistics site before the re-design, circa 2009.

Chapter 3 | Attentional Focus
26
almost all areas of the page (Figure 3-6). Had the reward been anything less 
important than jobs in our area (and most memes are), we most likely would 
not have paid this price. We would have simply left the site. It’s always embar-
rassing to web page designers when, from behind a one-way mirror in a usabil-
ity test, they see us abandon their work and go to Google to find something 
that could have been found from the page we were just looking at. You’d be 
surprised how often that happens.
You should learn what the gaze pattern is for your meme. After the State of 
Washington did that for its unemployment site, this is how they changed it 
(Figure 3-7). The link to “Employment Resources” was now in the top left at 
the epicenter of the F-shaped gaze pattern. And in the middle bar of the F, they 
put an easy pull-down menu where we could specify “I am a job seeker…look-
ing for job openings.” It was much easier for us to meet our goals. We found 
our way to the job openings in a fraction of the time.

employment statistics site.iv

27
Positioning key content within the F-shaped gaze pattern is a great way to 
help us meet our goals. But as meme-makers, you have business goals too, 
and on ad-supported sites, this often means attracting our attention away 
from our goals and toward ads or other monetizable content. Or thinking of 
smartphones, you may find that push notifications are needed to remind us 
to use your app. Data published by Quettra in 2016 calculated that 80% of 
us never use an app again five or more days after we install it.v An animated 
reminder to which we again orient our attention is often needed to trigger 
another usage session.
But the psychology of triggering an involuntary orienting response is one you 
should understand well and use sparingly, because it further constricts the 
already narrow bottleneck of our attention.
Figure 3-7. Washington State employment statistics site, circa 2010.

Chapter 3 | Attentional Focus
28
Meme-makers since the inventors of the “pop-up ad” in the late 1990s have 
known that memes that jiggle, flash, or are bright red exploit a loophole in 
our attentional systems and get us to look at them regardless of our goals for 
the moment. Recall that the cone-shaped cells in our fovea have the acuity, 
color sensitivity, and depth perception required to process your meme. So 
what are the rod-shaped cells that dominate the periphery of our retina 
optimized for? They are best at detecting small changes in light and motion.vi 
The light from the entire binocular visual field, ranging 100 degrees out from 
the nose temporally to both sides, stimulates the peripheral retina and is pro-
cessed in the occipital cortex, where it is stitched into a running conception 
of our environment. This is integrated with the sounds heard by our ears that 
are formed into their own neural model in our parietal lobes.vii
So, for example, while reading song lyrics on Pandora, we form an image of the 
entire page, not resolute enough to read it all, but just enough to get a sense 
for the broader space we’re in. We continually compare new impulses from 
the eyes and ears to the current neural model, and we are supremely adapted 
to ignore things that stay the same, but to orient to things that move. (This 
neural wiring is common in predatory species like ourselves. We are so tuned 
to movement that we often fail to notice things that instantly appear or disap-
pear in a phenomenon called change blindness.)
Thus, when something in the periphery animates, whether vertically, horizon-
tally, or in apparent proximity to us, that motion violates our neural model 
and we orient to it. The parietal lobe disengages our attention from whatever 
it’s currently on, our superior colliculus moves our fovea your direction, and 
our thalamus re-engages it.viii Our heart rates drop briefly and we turn our 
eyes and heads to allow our nervous systems to encode your meme. This is 
the orienting response.
Done well, it’s very effective. The cacophony of early popup ads later settled 
into the horizontal carousel, as seen in Figure 3-8, in which informational 
slides scroll to the next one automatically, sometimes with integrated adver-
tisements. We orient to this motion even though our task-positive goals might 
take us elsewhere on the page, and any of us in a mind-wandering task-nega-
tive mode welcomes the unsolicited content.

Bottlenecks
29
However, other animations trigger our orienting response in a way that 
feels out of proportion to our perceptible benefits. With the proliferation 
of streaming video, many video ads began playing automatically on the pages 
we navigated to. Or in another example from 2015, one of us remarked that 
desktop notifications for updates of Adobe Reader had been interrupting our 
attention for ten years without a noticeable change in the software experi-
ence (Figure 3-9). Despite these updates being important for security and 
requiring our approval, many of us made fun of Adobe over this for weeks. 
Windows 10 later corralled all of these “desktop toast” alerts into an “action 
center,” removing the animations and replacing them with a black and white 
system icon. This helped, but in 2016 we were still awaiting more control over 
the timing of system updates, one of which had become Windows itself.
Even as we were less often needlessly orienting to desktop notifications, we 
were seeing ever more alerts on our smartphones. The dominant design for 
these was the bright red dot with a number in it, sometimes called “the meat-
ball,” indicating how many new pieces of content the meme-makers wanted us 
to attend to (Figure 3-10). This was enormously effective at cuing a response 
to Facebook, LinkedIn, and others, but by 2016, duplicate notifications were 
appearing on both phones and PCs, and cancelling one did nothing to cancel 
the others.

Chapter 3 | Attentional Focus
30
If animation and red colors attract attention, then what’s the problem with 
more of it, you ask? The answer is that when we come to perceive them to be 
a constant in our environment, rather than an anomaly, they are incorporated 
into our neural model of the status quo, and we stop orienting to them. This 
is a form of habituation and it is the opposite of orienting. It is the gradual 
decrease in our likelihood to look if we are not rewarded. From the time we 
were monkeys, a rustle in the branches would cue us to look, but swaying 
branches in a swift breeze would be ignored.
■
■Key Point  The more you trigger an orienting response with sound and animation, the more the 
attentional bottleneck will constrict and we will ignore it.
Habituation should concern you very much as a designer and a meme-maker: 
it means that the attentional bottleneck constricts even more the more you 
abuse it. And every time you exploit the orienting response, consider how 
others are too. Each time a red dot or bell tone takes our attention away 
from a task-positive activity, like for example using a smartphone navigation 
app while driving, there are potentially dangerous consequences. And this is 
only compounded when you consider our cars themselves might be flashing 
and beeping at us at the same time.
Figure 3-10. “Meatball” notifications of new content on smartphone (left) and web site (right).

31
That is why good designers know to notify only when we will be reinforced 
for it. The makers of Slack, a team productivity tool, helped make the @men-
tion feature go mainstream, in which we received a special alert when some-
one mentioned us by @name in a post. This helped us orient to group messages 
that called us out specifically or gave us an assignment that we did not want 
to miss. However, some of us began abusing the @channel feature, which sent 
one of these notices to everyone following a channel topic. Habituation was 
sure to ensue, so Slack put the brakes on it with a dialog box that asked if we 
were sure we wanted everyone to orient to our message (Figure 3-11).
Even the most serious and justified use of push notifications must take care 
not to train us into habituation. Starting January 2013, millions of mobile phone 
users in the United States began receiving a text message with sound and 
vibration alerting them about a child abduction in progress (Figure 3-12). These 
were the result of a partnership between the Department of Justice, the FCC, 
and FEMA, and named “AMBER Alerts” after an abducted Texas child whom 
law enforcement was unable to save in time in 1996. But on the DOJ web site, 
they acknowledged that these alerts should not be abused, and only issued 
when it was verified that a child was in danger and there was enough infor-
mation for the public to actually help. “AMBER Alerts should be reserved for 
those cases that meet the AMBER criteria. Overuse of AMBER Alert could 
result in the public becoming desensitized to alerts when they are issued.“ix
Figure 3-11.  Discouragement to send habituating notifications.

Chapter 3 | Attentional Focus
32
If we are at risk of habituating to memes that are this important, we’re likely at 
risk of habituating to yours as well. If you cannot ascertain where our atten-
tion will be directed next and be waiting there for us, then treat every leverag-
ing of our orienting response with the care of an AMBER Alert.

Gestalt 
Perception
Congratulations, your meme has penetrated a brain. It survived the atten-
tional bottleneck. Now it needs to be interpreted as you intended; otherwise, we 
will not be able to decide its value to us. This is the perceptual bottleneck. We 
must interpret your carefully-arranged pixels to be that precise thing with that 
precise function that you intended, be it a download button, a play button, or 
even a dinosaur. If we do not, our attention will move on to something else.
You may feel that all you need to do to ensure we interpret your elements 
correctly is to label them well. But as you saw in the last chapter, we don’t 
often expend the cognitive resources to read, which it turns out is a rather 
effortful way to consume memes. Psychologists have known for decades that 
we are cognitive misers, meaning that we will allocate the least possible 
processing power to determine your value to us.
So as we are scanning your meme and the graphic elements that make it up, 
we employ Gestalt perception, which is a precognitive determination, a 
guess really, of what the elements mean or do based on the size, shape, posi-
tion, or other elements around them. Precognitive means we judge your meme 
without thinking, and “Gestalt” is the German word for shape or form, mean-
ing we judge your meme based on its appearance and the company it keeps.i 
To see how much context contributes to the meaning we perceive, read this 
text (Figure 4-1).

Chapter 4 | Gestalt Perception
38
In a similar manner, long before we read the labels on your buttons, your float-
over text, or your tagline under your logo, or much of anything, we've already 
determined for ourselves how your meme works and what it can do for us.
■
■Key Point  Before we read the textual labels on graphic elements, we precognitively examine 
their form (Gestalt) and nearby elements to guess their function, so as to expend the least 
attentional effort to reach our goals.
Here’s an example. In 2007, Microsoft started selling perpetual versions of 
Office as a downloaded product rather than a store-bought DVD, taking 
advantage of the fact that most of us now had high-speed internet. Someone 
a lot like you had to design the download process. This was no small assign-
ment; your interface brought in millions of dollars every month. After send-
ing us through a pretty typical checkout, we came to the screen shown in 
Figure 4-2 where we could click a blue button labeled “Download Now” to 
download what we had bought. Unfortunately, underneath the blue button, at 
the bottom-right of the box, appeared a promotional advertisement with a 
larger green button labeled “Get Started Now” (Figure 4-2).
Figure 4-1.  Demonstration of the influence of context on perception.ii

Bottlenecks
39
Many of us clicked the lower, larger green button instead of the higher, smaller 
blue one, which took us away from our goal. Some never made it back.
Now mind you, we weren’t zoning out here in some task-negative haze; we 
had just spent as much as $400 and so we were devoting all of our task-posi-
tive attention on getting our reward. But as Gestalt theorists have told us for 
years, the size, shape, color, and positioning of objects are extremely influential 
on our correct perception of it, sometimes more so than the words. In this 
case, the wrong button was larger, making it seem more important. It was the 
same green color green as the graphic under the words “Thank You” in the 
progress bar at the top, both of which were oriented to the right, suggesting 
to us that their function was similar, and therefore we should click it next.
Finally, the wrong button was located lower in the dialog box. Graphic artists 
will tell you that humans often assume “progress reads left to right and rolls 
downhill,” again suggesting to us precognitively that the correct button was in 
the lower-right corner of the box.

Chapter 4 | Gestalt Perception
40
After Microsoft listened to us explain this perceptual bottleneck in our own 
words, this is how they changed the screen (Figure 4-3). Many more of us 
downloaded Office successfully, and fewer of us called their help desk. The 
Office meme continued to populate the earth. Notice that the old button 
and the new one were identically labeled “Download Now.” But the revision 
helped to align the graphical treatment with the meaning, as Gestalt theorists 
would have recommended. The cost to fix this perceptual bottleneck was 
minimal, but the payoff was immense, as is often the case when minor design 
improvements are made to interfaces used by millions.
The Gestalt principles, as applied to digital media (Figure 4-4), assert that with-
out really thinking, we assume the function of an element is related to others…
	a.	 That are in close proximity
	b.	 That are similar in color or shade
	c.	 That are similar in size or shape
	d.	 That are moving in the same direction (common fate)
	e.	 That are on the same line
	f.	 That share a common region
	g.	 That are graphically connected
Figure 4-3.  Redesigned download dialog box for Office 2007.

41
When your graphical treatment is taking advantage of the Gestalt principles, 
the meaning of your elements is grasped without thinking. You will need far 
less text (if any) to explain what they do, and your meme will demand far less 
attention from us.
Perhaps the best example of leveraging Gestalt principles was found in the 
music play-along games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero (Figure 4-5). The scroll-
ing fret board on the screen matched the buttons on the faux-guitar con-
troller in both color and position (from left to right: green, red, yellow, blue, 
and orange). With almost no explicit instructions, we knew what we had to 
do to play the game. This smart use of Gestalt principles helped millions of 
first-time users quickly learn the game and come to enjoy its rewards, no 
doubt contributing to the explosive success of this meme. For this reason, in

2007 IGN declared that Rock Band “may just be among the best party games 
ever released.”iii The game was so successful that the CEO of Electronic Arts 
admitted they were hard-pressed to meet the demand of the 2007 holiday 
season.iv
Unfortunately, violations of the Gestalt principles are easier to find. Think 
of the difference between early TV remote controls and those of today 
(Figure 4-6). Early models were a simplistic grid of identically-sized buttons; 
they may have included a few colors and regions to communicate meaning, 
but they primarily relied on text. This design had two obvious problems: it 
demanded too much attention, which we preferred to allocate to the TV, and 
we could not use our sense of touch to find the right button in the dark when 
the text was unreadable. By contrast, later models used proximity, shape, and 
color more extensively. They can still improve, but today we can now use our 
Gestalt perceptions to a far greater extent to determine the meaning of the 
elements.

■
■Key Point  When your meme is taking advantage of the Gestalt perceptual principles, we grasp 
its function without thinking. When your design conflicts with Gestalt principles, our assumptions 
impair our ability to use it.
Here’s another hardware example. Most of us drive cars with windshield wip-
ers that can be set to swipe at intervals from seldom to often, depending 
on how heavy it is drizzling. Sounds simple enough, so why do we have such 
trouble learning which way to turn the knob? Why do we seemingly need to 
perform another trial-and-error test every time we use it? Put another way, 
why is this so cognitive rather than precognitive? Violations of Gestalt are 
again to blame.
Figure 4-6.  Early (a) and later-model (b, c) television remote controls.

Chapter 4 | Gestalt Perception
44
Look closely at the “wedge” graphic on the wiper control in the pictures in 
Figure 4-7. The design on the left marked (a) asks us to turn to the fat end 
of the wedge for a long interval and the skinny end of the wedge for a short 
interval. To interpret this graphic correctly, we need to invoke a negative: a fat 
wedge/long interval is for light rain and a skinny wedge/short interval is for 
heavy rain. Worse, the direction we must turn the knob does not share the 
common fate as the volume of rain (it is opposite, we dial the knob forward 
for less rain, and we dial it back for more rain). Very cognitive. Almost mind 
bending.
But on the right is another design marked (b), where the wedge is flipped 
upside down and aligned to the amount of rain (skinny for light rain, fat for 
heavier rain). Moreover, we dial it forward for more rain, and we dial it back 
for less rain. Way easier (and if we still don’t get the hint, they added a few 
raindrops to drive it home). In the second design, the graphic is labeled in a 
more Gestalt, precognitive, user-friendly way, and it works as we expect even 
when we cannot point our fovea at it.
This is not a trivial issue: if smartphones have suddenly interested lawmakers 
in the perils of distracted driving, shouldn’t they also examine the attentional 
demands that are already present? And as we try to bring computing services 
to commuters trapped in cars as they navigate sprawling suburbs to get to 
work, unfriendly designs of traditional car functions like this will steal atten-
tion from more useful memes. Users like us have long complained about soft-
ware that is not user-friendly; the day has already arrived when cars are held 
to the same standard.

Gestalt principles of perception.

Bottlenecks
45
What if you don’t conform to Gestalt principles in your functional and graphic 
design? If you don’t, one of two types of errors will result: unrelated elements 
will look related and we will infer they have the wrong function (call that Type 
1 error), and related elements will look unrelated and we will overlook their 
correct function (Type 2 error).
An example of Type 1 error where we infer the wrong function is found 
on the rightmost TV remote control back in Figure 4-6c. After pausing a 
video, we often press the stop button when we wanted to press play to 
resume the video. (This isn’t much of a problem when playing DVDs, but 
when streaming something from Netflix or Amazon, if we stop the video, 
it often takes several clicks and a good minute or two to resume while 
everyone in the room is yelling “hey!”) Due to the Gestalt principle of 
proximity, we assume the play button will be adjacent to the pause button, 
and when it is not, we press the stop button in error. Another example of 
Type 1 error, where we infer the wrong function, is the wrong download 
button for Microsoft Office that we described earlier, this time due to the 
Gestalt principles of size and color.
Here’s an example of Type 2 error, where we overlook the correct func-
tion of an element due to Gestalt principles. In 2013, SimplyMeasured.com a 
successful web site that sold social-media analytics underwent a redesign. In 
this screenshot, their catalogs of reports were presented as individual tiles 
(Figure 4-8a). Twitter reports were sometimes light blue and other times they 
were red; red was a color also shared by YouTube reports. Thus we over-
looked them, assuming them to be unrelated although they were.
After the company did an easy redesign (Figure 4-8b), all of the Twitter reports 
were rendered light blue, all of the Facebook reports were dark blue, and the 
other reports were orange. A simple alignment of color and meaning com-
municated a lot of information without any text, including the number, nature, 
and type of reports they had in their catalog.

Chapter 4 | Gestalt Perception
46
Another example of how a design led us to overlook an element due to 
Gestalt perceptions was the “lozenge” that appeared in Microsoft Office 2007 
(Figure 4-9a). It looked like a logo to many of us, and it was located in the typi-
cal logo location at the top left of the app window, so we perceived it to be a 
non-functioning piece of pure art and didn’t think to click it. But we needed 
to click it to carry out important functions like saving our work or printing. 
Figure 4-8. Tiles of analytical reports for sale (a) before a Gestalt redesign and (b) after a 
redesign. Similar reports were grouped together proximally and treated with similar colors.v

47
Unable to find these functions due to our precognitive assumptions about the 
design, many of us descended into the costliest depths of cognitive demand 
hunting for them, often to no avail. (This was a pity, actually, because Office 
2007 introduced the ribbon, which was a real usability win.) By 2010, Office 
had retired the lozenge and brought back the File menu we had come to know 
and use without much thought at all (Figure 4-9b).
Figure 4-9. The File menu in (a) Microsoft Office 2007 and (b) Microsoft Office 2010.

Chapter 4 | Gestalt Perception
48
One of the most impactful ways to survive the perceptual bottleneck is just 
to scrub your creation of common Gestalt errors, especially on web sites. 
Now that you know your users assume the function of an element is related to 
others…
…that are in close proximity, then remove crucial navi-
gation links from the body of the page where ads are 
normally found.
…that are similar in color or shade, then make clickable 
links a different color (and don’t make any normal text 
blue and underlined).
…that are of similar size or shape, then don’t try to use 
anything other than a triangle pointed to the right to 
play a video.
…that are moving the same direction, then don’t show 
the steps of a wizard or a checkout process as tabs; 
show them as an arrow or a line.
…that are on the same line, then make a carousel for 
related elements and keep unrelated ones out.
…that share a common region, then put boxes around 
related elements and keep unrelated ones out.
…that are graphically connected, then sometimes you 
should just draw a line and connect the dots for us.
The final word we want to say about this is that we know you sometimes 
intentionally use Gestalt principles to trick us into thinking unrelated ele-
ments are related. We now see plenty of ads that look like posts from our 
friends or like legitimate news stories. This type of “contextual advertising” is 
very effective, leveraging similar size (of thumbnail photos), similar color (of 
text) and proximity (location among real posts) to get us to click. However, 
as Facebook saw after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a company can face 
criticism when it tries to connect us to legitimate news at the same time it 
allows ads (which are not held to the same standards of journalistic integrity) 
to take on a similar Gestalt and blend in among them.
Another example involves the internet lists that we love so well, such as “23 
photos taken moments before tragedy struck,” and “15 historical photos that 
will leave you breathless.” Sometimes we are truly rewarded for our attention; 
other times we are not. Inevitably, however, we will spot an advertisement 
somewhere near the slideshow that displays an arrow designed to resemble 
the button we need to click for the next slide.

Bottlenecks
49
This is fine, but we will eventually habituate to them as we do to ads that trick 
our orienting response. Treatments that initially appear similar are soon dif-
ferentiated in our perception, and the mental effort it takes us to learn how 
you’re tricking us will soon become automatic and precognitive itself. At the 
same time, the price that these ad placements fetch almost inevitably falls over 
time, because anything that tricks a click is unlikely to close a sale since it is 
not in alignment with our goals. Thus the ROI on these ads will eventually dis-
appoint your advertisers. Once again, it’s better to align with our goals than to 
derail them. The more you rob the bank, the less cash we leave there to steal.

Depth 
Perception
The last chapter examined how we your users correctly perceive the meaning 
of graphic elements, and how that’s crucial for the success of your apps, web 
sites, or entire operating systems.
But what if the element is a dinosaur and your meme is a video game, or a 
special effect for a motion picture (Figure 5-1)?

Chapter 5 | Depth Perception
52
Here you will need to use more than just the Gestalt principles to get us to 
interpret your digital innovation correctly. To get the reaction you want from 
us, the elements must appear to occupy three-dimensional space and move 
around in it the way we expect. If the dinosaurs in ARK: Survival Evolved and 
Jurassic Park didn’t evoke the sense that they were huge and chasing us, the 
games would have failed. Even the candy in Candy Crush had to have some 
appearance of depth to be convincing. We’re not sure we would have played 
"Colored Square Crush" quite as much.
The challenge is, most monitors are still flat, two-dimensional slabs, and so is 
everything displayed on them. So how do you make flat things look fat?
One of two ways: the fancy, expensive hardware way (using special forms of 
production and either active or passive goggles) or the cheap, effective soft-
ware way (using only graphics). We’ll explain both, and then argue why the 
latter is essential and the former has historically been a waste of money.
■
■Key Point  To give a sense of depth, you can use specialized production and eyewear to 
present slightly disparate images to each eye, or you can use less expensive graphic treatments 
that may be just as engaging.

in movie and game design. Image from ARK: Survival Evolved © Studio Wildcard. Used with

53
To achieve dimensionality the hardware way, you somehow need to present 
a slightly different image to our right and left fovea. The images should be of 
the same object, but just from a slightly different angle. This retinal dispar-
ity happens all the time because our two eyes sit side-by-side separated by 
an inch or two (unlike a Cyclops), and the slight disparity in their viewpoints 
leads us to perceive the object as a solid against a background rather than just 
more background (Figure 5-2). This phenomenon is called stereopsis.
We can get the effect with these two slightly different images of Icelandic 
ponies (Figure 5-3). Alone each image looks flat, because both fovea see the 
same thing when we train them on one or the other. But if we hold them 
about 18 inches away and look through them to a point a few feet on the 
other side of the book or monitor (like we would a "magic eye" picture), we 
uncross our eyes and push out our focal point and thus show the left image to 
the left eye and the right image to the right eye. Soon, a middle image appears 
that "pops" with three-dimensionality.

offset between them.

There it is, the illusion of depth. We’re not just looking at a picture of a ponies 
in Iceland, it feels like we’re in Iceland. If only you could convince us to sit 
through an entire movie or video game with our eyes uncrossed this way. 
Since that would only give us a headache, over the years you’ve introduced 
a number of hardware solutions to present different images to each of our 
eyes. While some of these memes have thrived, most have gone extinct or 
never made it off the Galapagos. The wide array of stereopsis goggles is a great 
example of a meme pool.
"Active goggles" or "stereoscopes" are a pair of mini-cinemas that try to trick 
us into seeing depth by showing different images to the two eyes. The current 
form lets us insert our smartphones, which are displaying a split screen like 
the image of the Icelandic ponies (Figure 5-4). No eye crossing needed, but 
these devices have tended to be too big and bulky for our liking (although 
View-Masters introduced in 1929 were a big hit). Size problems are usually 
solved over time with shrinking technologies, but smaller technologies are 
generally also more expensive.
Figure 5-3.  Disparate right and left images, which appear to have depth when viewed with 
crossed or uncrossed eyes.i

This is why we’ve seen the co-evolution of the "passive goggles" approach. 
Here, the two disparate images are projected externally, on top of each other, 
overlaid on the same screen. The passive goggles then blot out one of the 
images for each eye, leaving us to see the slightly disparate angles and get that 
sense of depth (Figure 5-5). The 1950s version of this overlaid red and blue 
images on each other, and the red and blue cellophane lenses in the goggles 
obscured one of them for each eye. Kudos for creativity, but this distorted 
the usual color of things. This was bad: in addition to depth, color is key to us 
interpreting images as the things they represent (precisely as we saw in the 
last chapter on the Gestalt principles). More recent solutions projected two 
polarized images to us while we wore polarized goggles. One frame showed 
images with light waves aligned northeast-to-southwest, and the next frame 
showed images aligned northwest-to-southeast.
By orienting our two polarized lenses the opposite way, they wiped out one 
of the images for each eye. (For an analogy, imagine looking at a white picket 
fence through a window with blinds. If the blinds are horizontal, we still see 
the fence; but if the blinds are vertical, the fence is hidden.) This has worked 
well and is affordable both in cinemas and on TVs, but the main criticism has 
been that the movie looks dark. We’re watching it through sunglasses after all.

These little complaints were not the biggest drag on 3D programming, nor 
was it always the expense to us, your intended audience (even though the 
prototype goggles-free 3D TVs cost most of us over a year’s worth of grocer-
ies). No, the biggest drag has been the expense to you, the movie and game 
producers. To offer us both 3D and 2D versions, you need to essentially shoot 
two different versions with different cameras, direction, and editing. Unless we 
showed a lot of interest in 3D, you weren’t likely to go to the trouble.
At first, we did show a lot of interest. In its opening weekend, Avatar 3D (2009) 
made over three times the revenue that the 2D version made. Shortly after, 
Alice in Wonderland 3D (2010) made twice what the 2D version did. But it has 
been all downhill from there (Figure 5-6). Toy Story 3 (2010) made the same 
amount in 2D and 3D, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2010) actually 
made less in 3D than in 2D. On television, ESPN, BBC, and DIRECTV have all 
cut back or killed their 3D programming, and this is despite the fact that many 
of us could have easily watched it on our LED, LCD, and plasma TVs. All we 
needed to do is flip on the 3D feature and put on the passive goggles.
Figure 5-5.  Passive goggle use color or polarized lenses to block out a left or right image. In 
practice, the images will be superimposed; they are separated here for illustration.

This drop-off in revenue had all the markings of a fad: we checked it out at 
first, but it didn’t keep us hooked. In fact, a very similar pattern was prob-
ably observed with 1950s 3D movies and the red-and-blue cardboard goggles. 
Plenty of pundits speculated why.iv Our view was that most movies and video 
games were already made with great depth perception achieved the software 
way, involving graphic treatments and our learned associations. Hardware-
based stereopsis wasn’t a breakthrough innovation that gave us 3D for the 
first time; it was a tweak on how it was done. The 3D memes have failed so 
far to out-compete their 2D counterparts in part because they haven’t yet 
offered an experiential advantage worth the resources (or the bulky head-
gear) needed to enjoy them.

With shockingly few graphic tricks called monocular depth cues, we have 
always perceived flat objects to be dimensional solids with plenty of depth of 
field (even when we had no goggles, flat monitors, and at times only one good 
eye). The most widespread trick is light source vectors: brightly illuminating 
surfaces facing assumed light sources and darkening those facing away from 
them. Beyond that, we perceive objects to be more distant if…
they are partially obscured by other objects (interposition)
they appear smaller than we expect relative to objects 
whose size we know well (relative size)
they are positioned near the narrow end of converging 
lines that we expect to be parallel (linear perspective, 
shown in Figure 5-7a)
their texture appears denser and less detailed than the 
texture elsewhere in our field of vision (texture gradi-
ents, shown in Figure 5-7b)
the light from them is more scattered and misty (atmo-
spheric perspective, shown in Figure 5-7c)
the light from them is out of focus (depth of field)
they shift very little when we move our heads left and right 
(motion parallax: objects that shift a lot are perceived 
to be closer)

Take a look at these two pictures of dinosaurs in Figure 5-8 to see how the proper 
use of these principles by designers can achieve radically better dimensionality, as 
in the upper image (Figure 5-8a) compared to the lower one (Figure 5-8b).
• 
Light source vectors: In the upper image (a), the sides of the 
gun, people, and the dinosaur pointed toward the light 
are more brightly lit than their shadowy other sides, so 
we perceive them to be a solid illuminated by the dim sun. 
In the lower image (b), we see this graphic trick done on 
the rocks, but not on the dinosaur or on the trees, which, 
as a result, look flat.
• 
Interposition: The dinosaur in the upper image (a) obscures 
trees and ruins, so we perceive it to be closer. We almost 
forget that the image is completely flat and that no part 
of it is closer or farther.
• 
Relative size: The dinosaur in the upper image (a) is posi-
tioned beside two men, whose circa six-foot height is so 
well-known to us that it is automatically assumed. This 
makes the dinosaur seem to be a towering height. In the 
lower image (b), no known object tells us the dinosaur’s 
size. It could be the size of a cat chewing on chicken 
bones for all we know.
• 
Linear perspective: The the walls of the ruins in the upper 
image (a) appear to converge, although we’ve learned 
through much experience that they are usually parallel. 
This tricks us into thinking the flat image is as deep as a 
building. The lower image (b) does not employ this trick.
• 
Texture gradients: In the upper image (a), we see every 
wrinkle in the dinosaur’s face, but on the feet, belly, and tail, 
that texture is smoothed out and nearly gone. This adds 
to the sense that the tail recedes into the background.
• 
Atmospheric perspective: In the upper image (a), the moun-
tains, ruins, and trees in the background appear shrouded 
in scattered light. Through learned experience, this 
primes us to think they are far away.
• 
Motion parallax: This trick requires movement to see it, 
but it represented a great breakthrough in video games. 
As we move our avatar left and right with the controller, 
a good game will show near objects shifting radically left 
to right, but show distant objects shifting only a little. In 
the upper image (a), if we moved our heads left or right, 
we’d expect the gun to shift a lot, but the ruins less so. 
This gives a very keen sense of depth.

Bottlenecks
61
Our point is this: before you start building mini-cinemas for our fovea using 
expensive technology that may be cool - but bulky or unaffordable for both of 
us, consider whether your graphic treatment already gives a sufficient sense of 
depth. If it doesn’t, by all means have another pass at it. But if you are already 
leveraging these principles of depth perception, maybe you should focus next 
on the story, not the stereopsis.

Motion 
Perception
For over 100 years we’ve used the word “movies” to refer to your rapid 
slideshows of still-frame pictures in which nothing actually moves, so it is 
no secret that the entire entertainment industrial complex is founded on an 
­illusion—the illusion of motion.
But for 100 years, meme-makers involved in the film industry have referred to 
the wrong psychological tendency to explain why it works. Don’t feel bad, so 
have many psychologists.
Sorting out all of this confusion will help those of you who make movies or 
video games understand the barriers you’ll encounter in representing excit-
ing action scenes with bleeding-edge technology. And not unlike the takeaway 
from the last chapter, it will also help you prioritize whether to get into a tech-
nological arms race with this bottleneck, or to focus instead on storytelling.
Where did the confusion about motion begin? Before film went digital, the 
mechanics inside projectors pulled down each of the pictures on a film strip 
into a beam of light, held it there for a bit, then pulled down the next picture. 
However, pulling down frames this way was blurry, the same way waving your 
hand in front of your face is blurry. So this blur needed to be obscured with 
what was called a “shutter,” a piece of metal held in front of the light while the 
frame was being positioned in a momentary blur (Figure 6-1). The mystery at 
6

Chapter 6 | Motion Perception
64
the time was: why don’t people perceive the flickering caused by the shutters? 
As long as the moments of darkness were shorter than 16 milliseconds, they 
were invisible. Why?
To answer, we need to introduce memory. But we’ll forewarn you this still 
doesn’t explain how we perceive motion.
Broadly defined, memory is our neural ability to preserve the sensation of 
something past the point that it is gone. It is quite a talent for an organic 
creature. After any stimulus, be it your meme or anything else, has stopped 
enervating our sensory systems, we retain a version of it, a representation we 
can pull up and re-experience at will, sometimes for another second, some-
times for a century. Neurological media is the original media; it predates pixels, 
cellulose, and paper.
Being remembered is also the next bottleneck for your meme to survive; if it 
does, it means we valued it highly enough to copy it for later. This is simply not 
done for the vast majority of things that stimulate our senses. Unremembered 
memes that fail to survive this third bottleneck cease to exist when they move 
out of sensory range.
Iconic memory (its stage name; it also goes by “sensory memory” and “per-
sistence of vision”) is the first and briefest form of preservation. It lasts at 
most a quarter of a second, and that is under ideal conditions where it is not 
displaced by something else. Our fovea are once again at play. Most sensory 
cells reset very quickly after they are no longer stimulated (including the rod 
cells in our peripheral retina). But the cone cells in our fovea and the ganglion 
cells behind them continue to fire for up to 250 milliseconds longer after 
­photons stop hitting them, letting us experience something that has past.ii

When someone waves a sparkler around in the dark, the trail we see is our 
rapidly-fading iconic memory of it (Figure  6-2). In reality, there is no trail. 
Iconic memory is also the reason we barely perceive our own blinks.
And yes, it is iconic memory that preserves each frame of a movie, which fills 
in and replaces the darkness of the “shutter” as they block the light to pull 
down the next frame.
■
■Key Point  Being remembered is the next key bottleneck for your meme. Iconic memory is the 
first and briefest form. The next four chapters focus on longer forms.
This explanation is as neat today as it was 100 years ago. (And it is still rele-
vant, since computer monitors also flicker imperceptibly on a certain “refresh 
rate.”) But the explanation was so neat it was over-extended. Iconic mem-
ory has been cited as the reason we see motion by many writers, but it only 
explains why we don’t see the flickering. Think of it this way: iconic memory is

performed by the nerves in the eye and they’re smart enough to fill in a bit of 
darkness. But to perceive something as complex as motion, we need a brain 
and more advanced cognition. This error wasn’t just made by meme-makers, 
psychologists made it too. That may be why our collective understanding of 
motion perception is still somewhat infantile.
Here’s what we know: There are pathways, and possibly individual neurons, in 
the occipital lobe at the back of our brain that are built to fire only when they 
detect motion in a certain direction or vector. Some neurons report motion 
moving north to south, others report motion moving northwest to southeast, 
others more complicated patterns. So basic motion perception appears to be 
hard-wired.
But a Gestalt principle from Chapter 4 also plays a critical role in perceiving 
the motion of complex things like living beings. Gestalt principle (d) that we 
introduced in Figure 4-4 states that we perceive things to be related that are 
moving the same direction. When the brain perceives two dots moving the same 
direction, it reports to us that they belong to a single rigid object (a principle 
Wertheimer called common fate) rather than separate objects. This leap 
allows us to perceive moving structures (like dinosaurs, cars, and spaceships), 
not just moving pixels.
Gunnar Johansson demonstrated this in 1973.iv He essentially made a very 
stripped-down movie consisting of only 10 dots. To explain why it worked, 
we put the dots into Figure 6-3. We’ve labeled the dots with letters that pair 
them up in order to make our point, but Johansson did not; they were just 
dots. The dots that we’ve labeled with the same letters were shown as mov-
ing the same direction in an animation that Johansson showed to students. 
Despite the graphical minimalism, every one of the students saw a person 
walking. Because of the perception of common fate, the pair of A dots were 
seen to belong to a unified head and torso; the pairs of B and C dots to arms; 
the pairs of D and E dots to legs. In the students’ brains, the combination of 
neural motion detectors and Gestalt perceptions were stitched together into 
a human.
Johansson added sinusoidal wave patterns and a few other complexities to the 
motion of the dots, and the students now saw a person walking toward them, 
or running, or bicycling, or even dancing with a partner. (We’d love to see a 
whole movie of dots, or even a whole movie genre.)

Bottlenecks
67
So why then do we perceive motion? Iconic memory is not the explanation. 
It’s the joint operation of visual vector analysis at the neural level and 
the Gestalt principle of common fate. Here is another example in a video 
of moving dots: https://youtu.be/pNe6fsaCVtI. Between :45 and :55,  
we perceive the two white dots as entirely independent of one another. But 
something magical happens at :55 as the third dot is added, and at 1:05 as the 
fourth dot is added - our Gestalt perception of common fate bolts the dots 
together into a rotating shape. 
This means that if you ever take a job as a movie or video-game maker, you’ll 
find that motion perception is about as easy to evoke as depth perception. 
You don’t need much more than 10 dots and two converging lines to show a 
person walking off into the sunset.
That is, unless you want that motion to be perceived as totally fluid. That’s 
where it gets hard.
When making this kind of meme, you will need to choose which level of 
motion perception to strive for: successive motion perception or fluid 
motion perception. Successivity is easier to achieve and more crude; it’s 
simply our perception that something has shifted position upon seeing suc-
cessive poses, despite our full awareness of the frozen before and after still-
frames. Fluidity is achieved when all the artificial jerkiness and flickering in 
such a shift is rendered imperceptible, thereby resembling motion perception 
of real-life objects.

To illustrate, one of the earliest maze-themed video games was 3D Monster 
Maze released in 1982 (Figure 6-4).v The game was programmed at only six 
still-frames per second (fps).vi This frame-rate was at the slow end of any con-
tinuum you can name. The Hobbit of 2013 was filmed at 48 fps, video games 
like the Halo series are produced at 30 fps, and most 35mm movies run at 
24 fps. But 3D Monster Maze was well below the minimum 12 fps needed to 
perceive fluid motion. The movement of Rex the dinosaur appeared jerky and 
strobe-like because we were able to make out individual frames in the anima-
tion. But make no mistake, we still thought Rex was moving, just in successive 
motion not fluid motion.
So if you achieve fluid motion at 12 fps, why do you and other producers want 
to shoot up to four times faster than that? Well apparently there are certain 
things you cannot depict at slower (cheaper) frame-rates, and as profession-
als who are committed to a certain level of quality, compromising here drives 
you crazy.
What things? First is panning. You’d like to show a beautiful vista that cannot fit 
in one frame. So you need to pan across it. But if you pan too fast, fluid motion 
breaks down to successive motion in our perceptions, and we notice the 
“strobing” or “judder.” How fast is too fast to pan? Experts say anything faster 
than three degrees a second. That means you should take a full seven seconds 
to pan the width of one frame, 30 seconds to pan 90 degrees, and a full minute 
to pan 180 degrees!vii In movie time, that’s forever. And with your executive 
producers pressuring you not to waste our precious attention on such non-
plot-advancing scenery shots, you often have to hurry up and squeeze out the 
beauty, which is the whole point of the shot. Tough dilemma.
Figure 6-4.  Early video games had successive motion rather than fluid motion.

Bottlenecks
69
Next, and perhaps more aggravating for you, is depicting very fast-moving objects 
like jets, missiles, spaceships…asteroids…Thor’s Hammer…erhm, pretty 
much anything cool. Same thing: the faster these objects move, the less fluid 
they look without higher frame-rates, regardless of how high-def you shoot it. 
This is what galled Peter Jackson into filming 2013’s Hobbit at 48 fps. To land 
the meme with audiences, he wanted the vistas to take our breath away and 
the Orcs’ arrows to really move. So Jackson upped the frame-rate. (In many 
ways he was chasing the higher standards for action set by video-games, which 
had the advantage of 30 fps on PC monitors, not unlike many filmmakers of 
the time.)
■
■Key Point  With motion perception, as with depth perception, surviving the bottleneck at a 
basic level is relatively easy. But the expense and difficulty increases rapidly to achieve the last 
elements of total realism.
With all respect to your craft, as your audience, we have to suggest that all 
this may be wasted effort. If you think your movie-making technology is poorly 
equipped to fluidly pan and pursue fast-moving objects, it turns out so are our 
nervous systems. If we were standing on a snowy ridge looking at the Lonely 
Mountain where Smaug the dragon lives, we wouldn’t fluidly pan from left 
to right. Instead our eyes would jump from spot to spot in what are called 
saccades.
The same thing goes for fast-moving objects. Our eyes cannot fluidly pursue 
anything moving more than 30 degrees per second: major-league baseball play-
ers can’t follow a pitch for the last 10 feet, and neither would we be likely to 
follow Thor’s hammer. In these cases, we need to perform catch-up sac-
cades where we rapidly shift our gaze (as fast as 500 degrees per second) 
to the point where we guess the object will be next.viii (Fortunately, thanks 
to iconic memory, we don’t perceive the blur as our eyes catch up, only our 
iconic memory of our last fixation point.) Producers should experiment more 
with what we might call “saccadic shots” that show the first and last positions 
of objects (and maybe a little blur in the middle) and experiment whether that 
evokes in us the real-life wow of a really fast moving thing.
Put another way, you should not rule out the drama that can still be contained 
in successive motion. Malcolm Evans, the programmer of 3D Monster Maze, 
himself noted that, “Quite a few times the monster would come up on me 
with absolutely no warning whatsoever and I’d jump out of my skin.”ix We 
did too when we played it. He tried to program in a warning for us, “HE HAS 
SEEN YOU.” But this only amplified our dread, spawning a genre of “survivor 
terror” games played by millions to come.

The greater lesson here is sometimes you’ve already made it through a bottle-
neck and you don’t even appreciate it. If the investment needed to find a new 
way to achieve dimensionality, or to remove the last bit of judder in moving 
objects, grows exponentially as your marginal returns shrinks, you have to ask 
yourself if it’s really necessary. You have to ask yourself who is asking for it, 
because sometimes your users, customers, and audiences are not. Rex made it 
through the bottleneck of motion perception, regardless of his campy strobe-
like gait, and it was the Hitchcockian plot-mechanics of fear and dread that 
catapulted the game into a commercial and critical success.

Working 
Memory
We just introduced memory as our ability to preserve your memes past their 
vanishing point. We are fully equipped to retain some memes for the rest of 
our lives. But to win this honor, your meme must survive the memory bottleneck, 
which is just as unforgiving as the prior two.
What you commonly think of as memory is actually comprised of three com-
ponents: iconic (or sensory) memory, working memory, and long-term mem-
ory. The capacities of these three components of memory graph out like an 
hourglass: large, then tiny, then large again to the point of limitless. Our iconic 
memory stores our entire field of vision; everything hitting our retina are 
preserved if only briefly. By contrast, our working memory can only hold 
about seven digits at a time, or six letters, or four-five words, or a single 
addition problem.i Comparatively, that’s next to nothing. But our long-term 
memory has an immeasurable capacity; for example most people recognize 
90% of their school friends 15 years after graduation and 80% almost 50 years 
later.ii
This architecture of memory, the very definition of a bottleneck, presents a rich 
paradox about your users. The incredible permanence of some memes in our 
long-term memory is matched only by the wholesale clearance of most memes 
from our working memory. In a stark duality, we can remember forever what we 
don’t forget in a minute. But “forgetting” is too flattering of a word here, since 
that implies something was stored. Unencoded is a better word for all of the 
memes that get squeezed out of working memory. It isn’t forgetful, it’s exclusive,

and when it kicks out your meme, it kicks it out for good. If it were a corpora-
tion, it would hire one candidate for life at the end of a 30 second interview and 
a million candidates wouldn’t make it through the rotating door.
In 1999, psychologists Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris gave us a mind-
blowing example of how information can remain completely unencoded when 
working memory is busy with some other job. They asked people to watch a 
video and count how many basketball passes were made by a circling group of 
college students (Figure 7-1). Spoiler alert: watch these two videos yourself in 
this order before we ruin it for you:

or a casual game, your link to your newest blog post promoted on Twitter, 
your clever feature on a Mercedes dashboard, or whatever meme happens to 
be your life’s work. In fact, why don’t you take a moment and return to that 
same YouTube page where you just watched a video you will never forget and 
count how many other videos and promotions appear on the same page that 
you never encoded.

■Key Point  Information held in working memory decays rapidly and is displaced readily. Digital 
technology has helped overcome decay, but still struggles with displacement.
Let’s take a closer look at working memory (Figure 7-2). It was once called 
short-term memory, but this early model was discarded by many psychol-
ogists who realized that it’s lousy at storing information but great at pro-
cessing it. Working memory is the ever-changing sketchpad where we put 
new sensory information beside other sensory information, or beside long-
term memories, or semantic concepts, so we can hear them subvocalized or 
rotate them and analyze their relationships—that is, think. But to pull off this 
advanced level of processing, working memory has two key constraints: after 
the capacity of the sketchpad is filled, new information can only get onto it if it 
displaces information already there, and all of the information there will decay 
in about 30 seconds unless we actively work to keep it available.
How does this bottleneck affect the design and programming of applications? 
It has presented opportunities for digital entrepreneurs, who have helped us 
with the decay problem, and it has also been a barrier to you, whose memes 
suffer from the displacement problem.
For example, when we see a phone number on a web site that we want to 
call, it begins to decay in working memory if we have to move to another 
device to do that, say between a PC and a phone. This isn’t a huge challenge, 
since we can use our phonological loop to repeat the number subvocally

and bridge the gap. But with features like Skype’s click-to-call, there is no gap 
(Figure 7-3a); we can dial the number right from its location on a web site. 
Most smartphones have come to do the same thing, as well as launch map 
applications by touching street addresses.
This is an example of how you have addressed a universal human frailty, the 
decay of information, with great software and devices. In many cases today, we 
never need to retain the information in our working memory; it is retained in 
the device’s memory. Similarly, Amazon’s interface has spared us from several 
decay challenges where we would need to combine information from differ-
ent locations. Any time it has assisted us to store a credit card number, or ship 
to an address we’ve used in the past, or pull up products we recently viewed, 
another decay challenge is overcome.
But there remain other decay challenges that are not yet solved. One long-
time holdout is setting the caps lock on a keyboard. This is exactly the kind 
of information that will decay from our working memory 30 seconds after 
we set it, causing “state change” problems such as entering a wrong case-
sensitive password or mistyping IN ALL CAPS. Many password fields have 
come to remind us the caps lock is on (yours should too), but the tiny little 
light on hardware keyboards that was supposed to do this was situated too 
far outside our foveal acuity (Figure 7-4). If CAPS LOCK was displayed more 
prominently on our monitors, as a basic feature of operating systems, it would 
do a better job of reminding us that we set it.
Figure 7-3.  Interfaces that assist with working-memory decay include (a) click-to-call 
features (b) stored shipping addresses (c) indications of our folder in a directory, sometimes 
called “breadcrumbs”, and (d) a history of what we’ve viewed on e-commerce sites.

■Key Point  Overall, a productive scrub of your meme would be to go over it and ask yourself, 
“What information are we asking users to store in working memory, and how could we help keep 
it from decaying?”
But as much as we’ve enjoyed the assistance you’ve given us with decay chal-
lenges, we need far better designs for our displacement challenges. This is the 
strong tendency for information in working memory to be pushed out as new 
information arrives. This tendency is so strong that we’re willing to bet you 
that we can tell you our social security numbers and you won’t remember 
them. All we have to do is tell you a random string of digits right after we tell 
you our real SSN (at a modestly rapid rate of one digit per second), and when 
you go to write it down much of it will have been displaced. Psychologists 
demonstrated half a century ago that when people hear a series of digits, they 
tend to remember the first few (which are encoded in long-term memory) 
and the last few (which linger in the episodic buffer), but they can’t recall most 
of the digits in the middle, which were displaced before they were encoded 
(Figure 7-5).v
Figure 7-4.  Hardware-based indicators showing that the CAPS LOCK is set are too far 
removed from our foveal acuity to be seen, so this quickly decays from working memory.

Chapter 7 | Working Memory

We have long suffered just this kind of displacement on Twitter feeds, where 
on popular hash tags, older tweets are displaced and forgotten as new tweets 
appear. While at work, the arrival of a new email displaces everything on our 
working memory sketchpad, which is wiped so we can process the incoming 
information. And, quite often as we’re doing that, our mobile phones ring and 
displace the substance of the email.
Avoiding displacement has created a rule for designing digital interfaces: mini-
mize the features on software used for synchronous or audio communication. 
Synchronous is another word for “live,” and when we engage in live, real-
time communication like voice calls with other humans, or when we listen to 
audio podcasts or TED talks, our working memory is fully utilized. Any other 
activity would displace the spoken content, which is the whole point of the 
experience.
As a result, interfaces such as the Skype in-call window (Figure 7-6) show only 
a necessary few features, since any additional functionality would impair our 
ability to process the call we’re in. This makes it very hard to advertise against 
communications services, which are better monetized with subscriptions. 
Contrast how stripped-down this interface is with something like MLB.com, 
the web site for major league baseball, whose content we tend to consume in 
an asynchronous way. MLB.com can be fully laden with an almost absurd num-
ber of links and features because there is available capacity to our working 
memory when it is used in a serial way.

Figure 7-5. When we hear a series of 20 digits at a one-per-second pace, the first few are 
encoded, and the last few are held in our episodic buffer, but the middle digits are displaced by 
those that come later, thus remaining unencoded.

■
■Key Point  Advertisements served against technology that supports live communication or 
audio content will usually fail because it is displaced in working memory by the conversation itself.
Another prime circumstance for displacement occurs when we watch TV and 
work on a mobile device at the same time. This so-called “second screening” 
is of major concern to television advertisers. In the past, we watched only one 
screen at a time (the TV) and had capacity available in our working memory 
to comprehend the commercials. But today advertisers worry that their mes-
sage, even if it grabs our attention, is immediately displaced by the competing 
information on our iPads or smartphones in our laps, which itself is displaying 
a news article, celebrity gossip, or sports recap. Currently, 40% of American 
TV viewers report that they engage in second-screening,vi so advertisers have 
good reason to worry about the return on their $30 billion dollar annual 
investment in TV ads.vii
On the job, where the competition between memes is just as intense as for 
media consumers, a new job skill related to displacement challenges has qui-
etly risen to the top of many titles: the ability to multitask. Typical of the time, 
Monster.com in March 2014 listed 377 job announcements seeking this skill 
in the Seattle area alone. The idea is that some candidates can somehow avoid 
the displacement that happens with a myriad of simultaneous job demands, 
or perhaps simply endure the frustration and not quit. And these are the 
­candidates that employers seek.
Figure 7-6.  Early communications services were over-designed with too many features that 
went unused because they were displaced by the call itself. Modern interfaces are among the 
most minimalist on the web.

But is multitasking actually possible?
In some ways, no. And again we’re willing to bet our social security numbers 
on it. This time, listen while two of us tell you our social security numbers 
at the same time, one in each of your ears. Believe us, our information will 
remain safely unencoded. In the words of neuroscientists: “When humans 
attempt to perform two tasks at once, execution of the first task usually leads 
to postponement of the second one. This task delay is thought to result from 
a bottleneck occurring at a central, amodal stage of information processing…a 
neural network of frontal lobe areas acts as a central bottleneck of informa-
tion processing that severely limits our ability to multitask.” (Dux, Ivanoff, 
Asplund, & Marois, 2006).viii
So if true multitasking of simultaneous semantic information is impossible, 
what are the people doing who get those jobs? The answer is monotasking 
with rapid alternation.ix When they appear to talk on the phone and write 
an email at the same time, what they’re doing is saying a few words, then typ-
ing a few words, then saying a few more words, but almost never talking and 
typing at the same time.
That’s all well and good, but it creates switching costs, which are the perfor-
mance impairments that result as we repeatedly wipe, rebuild, wipe, and rebuild 
the information on our working memory sketchpad. Some of the impairment 
is in time: psychologists agree that it takes us longer overall to finish two tasks 
when we do them simultaneously than when we concentrate and finish one at 
a time (Marois & Ivanoff, 2005; Dux et al., 2006).x There is also evidence that 
our judgment is impaired (Beede & Kass, 2006; Dux et al., 2006)xi and that we 
are slower to learn a new expertise (Lin, 2009)xii if we are constantly switch-
ing. Finally, people who describe themselves as good multitaskers have been 
shown to be more easily distracted than monotaskers (Ophir, Nass, & Wagner, 
2009).xiii They must be that way to switch quickly when a new task turns up.
But this doesn’t close the case on this issue. After all, we can walk and chew 
gum. Isn’t that multitasking? We can drive and have a conversation with a pas-
senger at the same time. And some people are better at multitasking jobs than 
others. How do we explain that?
■
■Key Point  True multitasking is impossible. We either rapidly alternate between effortful tasks, 
or we learn one of the tasks so well that it becomes automatic.
We said previously that working memory is a sketchpad where information 
is combined in the service of thinking. Well, some of that information takes 
more capacity than others. Automatic processes that are well-learned 
and need no conscious attention require less capacity, whereas effortful

81
processes that are more novel and intentional require more (Figure 7-7). 
Automatic processes often involve sequences of movements, whereas effortful 
processes involve verbal information or logic.xiv This distinction yields general 
rule of thumb about multitasking: it is almost impossible to perform two effort-
ful processes at once, but we can perform one effortful process and one automatic 
process simultaneously, or two automatic processes.
This helps to understand what is happening in our digital-media examples. 
We probably cannot comprehend a TV commercial at the same time we are 
Skyping or reading on our iPads, since this involves two effortful processes. 
But we probably can comprehend a TV commercial while playing Candy 
Crush or Minecraft, if we have learned these non-verbal games so well they 
have become largely automatic.
Similarly, some people may get better at multitasking on the job if they take 
one task and learn it so well it becomes automatic. A customer-service agent 
at a call center, for example, might well be able to talk with one person and 
chat with another, if the chatting has become a well-learned process of just 
choosing standard responses from a menu to typical problems. (“Have you 
tried unplugging your Wi-Fi?” “Thank you for subscribing to Comcast; please 
take this survey to tell us how we did.”) But the moment two customers’ 
problems become unusual, an agent is faced with performing two effortful 
processes at the same time and likely has to put one of the ­customers on hold.

Figure 7-7. We can "multitask" and perform two processes if at least one is automatic. But 
performing two effortful processes is much more difficult or impossible.

And finally back to the car. For seasoned drivers on well-learned routes, driv-
ing is for the most part automatic, freeing us to have a conversation with a 
passenger at the same time, even though the latter is an effortful process. As 
such, it is probably wrong to conclude across the board that any in-car com-
puting would create displacement and impair driving. Assuming the interface 
for an in-car app requires neither our hands nor our fovea, we may indeed be 
able to use it safely if it makes no more demands on working memory than a 
conversation with a passenger, which is allowed everywhere.
To that end, popular media coverage of a 2013 AAA (American Automobile 
Association) Foundation studyxv often reported that it found that hands-free 
mobile phones were just as distracting to driving as hand-held phones. While 
true, both methods were tested on unfamiliar courses (on both simulators 
and residential streets), which would have been more effortful than many real-
world commutes.
Perhaps a more striking oversight of the press, however, was that on met-
ric after metric, neither hands-free nor hand-held mobile use was significantly 
more distracting than a passenger, nor even in many cases than a book-on-tape 
(and they were less distracting than doing mental math or using voice to text 
with someone). More research is needed, because this particular study didn’t 
show a very unusual risk of mobile phone use overall, and the routes used 
in the study were more novel and effortful than many normal circumstances.
But by the same logic, we agree that circumstances can change in a way that 
should pause the computing tasks. Just as we pause our conversations with 
passengers when traffic changes or we need to make a turn, it makes sense to 
find ways to pause the in-car apps easily whenever drivers wish, or when sen-
sors monitoring conditions both inside and outside the car deem it likely that 
we will need our working memories. Many cars disable the navigation system 
entirely once the car is going over 5 mph, but this across-the-board rule is 
too restrictive and could be made a lot smarter. If driving is less automatic 
for younger drivers in new locations, or when modern sensors detect unusual 
changes in the driving conditions, safety settings that are adjustable by both 
parents and programmers will be able to enable and disable them at appropri-
ate times. If nothing else, drivers should always be able to turn off in-car apps 
as easily as they turn off cruise control.
When computing devices address displacement as effectively as they assist 
with decay, many more of your memes will make it onto the sketchpad of 
working memory, and our experience with your digital creations will be 
­significantly improved.

Signal Detection
We aren’t simply passive observers when it comes to deciding which of your 
digital memes to remember for later and which to let slide from working 
memory. We can’t be. Just as it is with our choice of where we direct our gaze, 
we actively decide, based on our goals of the moment, whether each piece of 
incoming information is a meaningful “signal” to be attended to and encoded, 
or a “noisy” distraction to be ignored.
From 1985-1995, before the Internet went mainstream, psychologists and 
marketers estimated that we were already making this choice among 300 
bona-fide advertisements that we encountered each day,i about 140 of which 
were TV advertisements.ii By 2014, this estimate had grown to 360, but other 
forms of media were adding to the total count. For example, by 2012 over 2.5 
million “promoted posts” appeared in our Facebook newsfeeds from some 13 
million local business pages (see Figure 8-1).iii

Figure 8-1.  Deciding between wanted and unwanted messages is a cognitively effortful 
activity in which we actively engage.

86
But, nowhere were there more demands on our attention than in email.iv  
By 2015, people across the globe were getting 205 billion emails daily, (112 
billion business emails and 93 billion personal emails). On the job alone, this 
meant we were reading 88 emails and sending 34 each day, taking up about a 
quarter of our time at work. But between 2009-2013, the average number of 
text messages we were receiving tripled from 50 to 150 per day. Fully 80% of 
all emails sent in 2013 were spam, the very definition of distracting memes, 
and although spam filters were constantly improving, 20% of the mail in our 
inboxes were still unsolicited. And those spam figures only counted the emails 
that an algorithm thought was a waste of time.
Of course, the surest way to shield our working memory was simply to ignore 
all digital media; just turn away, turn off, and log out. We could abandon any 
effort to distinguish between good and bad memes and just decide they’re all 
bad. But the cost of doing this would have been missing out and failing to take 
advantage of the internet to achieve our goals. Some sort of balance was much 
more reasonable.
Psychologists David Green and John Swets understood the rules of this bal-
ancing act as early as 1966.v Their signal detection theory describes the 
trade-off that happens as we decide to attend to or ignore incoming informa-
tion. What they called “signal” and “noise” we’ll call good and bad memes, but 
the point is the same: information is either useful and relevant to our goals of 
the moment or a distraction. Here are the basic principles of signal detection 
theory adapted to digital media:
• 
We continually adjust our threshold to attend to infor-
mation or ignore it, depending on whether we want to 
avoid missing good memes or shield ourselves from bad 
memes. But these adjustments always come with a cost.
• 
To catch more good memes (hits or true positives), the 
cost is wasting our attentional capacity on more bad 
memes (false alarms or false positives).
• 
To shield our attentional capacity from more bad memes 
(true negatives), the cost is missing more good memes 
(misses or false negatives).

Bottlenecks
87
• 
Camouflage ups the costs: As good and bad memes 
become harder to distinguish, we make more errors.
• 
Perfectionism is punished: To catch the last 5% of good 
memes, we need to waste our attention on a vast num-
ber of bad ones. To ignore the last 5% of bad memes, we 
will miss a similarly vast number of good ones.
Here are those same principles now applied to how we decide between 
relevant emails and spam:
• 
We continually adjust our threshold for reading emails 
depending on whether we want to avoid missing relevant 
emails or shield ourselves from spam. For example, when 
we’re trying to concentrate on something else, we raise 
our threshold and only read the most important emails. 
But when we’re waiting for an important email to arrive, 
we lower our threshold and read everything.
• 
To catch more relevant emails we must waste our atten-
tional capacity on reading more spam (Figure 8-2a).
• 
To ignore more spam we must miss more relevant emails 
(Figure 8-2b).
• 
The more similar relevant email looks to spam, the dearer 
the costs both ways and the harder it is to make the right 
choice (Figure 8-2c).
• 
Ignoring the last 5% of spam requires that we miss many 
more relevant emails. Reading the last 5% of valid emails 
requires that we waste time reading much more spam.
Important note: In this discussion, we define relevant emails and spam selfishly, 
from our point of view as users. That means even an email from our family or 
our boss can be a spammy distraction. The engineers at Gmail focus on which 
emails should be delivered to a spam folder. So they call a legit email in the 
spam folder a false positive (falsely marked positive as spam), whereas for us a 
spam email we wasted our time reading is a false positive (falsely marked posi-
tive as something meaningful). Somebody should write Google and tell them 
to align their engineering terms better with the users’ point of view.

■Key Point  We actively adjust our thresholds depending on whether we want to catch more 
signals or ignore more noise. But both adjustments have a cost. To catch more signals, we must 
attend to more noise. To ignore more noise, we will miss more signals.
Figure 8-2. When we shift our threshold to (a) catch more legitimate emails, the cost is to 
read more spam. When we shift to (b) ignore more spam, the cost is to miss more legitimate 
emails. The more legitimate emails and spam look alike (c) in their graphical treatment, the 
more errors we make.

But regardless, the cold logic of signal detection theory applies equally to 
Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, Pinterest pins, or even picking up the phone 
when it rings. One of the most tragically funny scenes from the TV series 
Arrested Development was when the phone rang next to the bed of the unem-
ployed ex-psychologist Tobias Fünke, who had been recently pretending he 
was a comedian in the Blue Man Group. The call was from the actual Blue 
Man Group, asking him to audition. But Tobias was moping in bed with the 
covers pulled over his head. The narrator said, “The Blue Man Group finally 
calls Tobias with a life-changing opportunity. Unfortunately, he can’t hear it, so 
his life stays the same.”
What life-changing emails, tweets, posts, and pins are you ignoring right now?
Oh, that’s not fair. That’s exactly the kind of scare tactic that will trigger your 
“fear of missing out” (a.k.a., FOMO) and make you lower your threshold look-
ing for things you’ve missed, and therefore waste a few hours reading a bunch 
of junk. After that, you’ll realize we were just egging you on and you’ll raise 
your threshold again, now missing really cool stuff. Welcome to our world, the 
world of signal detection theory.
All kidding aside, this process is right at the heart of the memetic fitness 
that we talked about in the Prologue, the Dawkinsonian version of Darwinian 
sorting in which we, your users, are Mother Nature and our goals are the 
selection pressure that decides whether one meme is aligned with our needs 
and our nervous systems and worthy of encoding, and whether another meme 
is damned by a Gestalt violation, or a certain flatness, or a lack of realism, slat-
ing it for displacement before we waste more attentional resources on it than 
it deserves.
Signal detection theory was undoubtedly on the minds of Google engineers in 
2013 as they tinkered with the Gmail web interface. Their business goal was to 
send us advertisements that looked a lot like emails. You can’t blame them—
Gmail is free, so millions of us have it open all day at Google’s expense, and 
plenty of other companies were profiting from slipping in the occasional spam 
email. Google had been advertising above, below, to the side of, and all around 
our inboxes, not unlike the same practice in Microsoft’s Hotmail and Yahoo! 
Mail. But ads are always clicked more often if they are wedged right into the 
middle of the inbox, like spam. So how could Google get this performance on 
their own ads, without violating their informal mantra, “don’t be evil”?
The answer was a smart application of signal detection theory. They imple-
mented a mix of elements that simultaneously camouflaged their ads among our 
emails, but also set the ads apart so no one could accuse them of spamming us.
First the camouflage: ads began appearing at the top of our inbox, looking for 
all the world like regular emails. They showed the sender’s name, a subject 
line, and the first part of the message. The boldfacing of the subject line was 
a nice touch: this led us to believe that it was an unread email that needed to

be clicked on. All of this had the effect of elevating our rate of false positive 
mistakes, that is, perceiving an ad to be a real email and allocating attention to 
click on it and read it.
So at the same time, Gmail added a visual clue to set apart ads and emails: spe-
cifically, the tabs across the top that divided our inbox into “Primary,” “Social,” 
and “Promotions” emails. This was the opposite of camouflage; it helped us 
distinguish between corporate noise and organic email. And Google con-
strained itself to inserting its own ads only on the “Promotions” tab, mixing 
them in with the “buy this” mail we were getting anyway (Figure 8-3). Evil? Not 
evil? Most Gmail users voted with their clicks and kept on using it.
Gmail is not the only interface where we see designers like you doing what you 
can to distinguish good and bad memes for us. And if you don’t get around to 
doing it, we will. Users like us invented the Twitter hash tag precisely because 
it declared “this meme is good” when appended to a tweet. The whole reason 
that the hash # was added was also to distinguish signal from noise. Because 
we didn’t usually type this character in our normal conversations, including it 
in a search helped us look for tags rather than everyday words. As such, the 
results we got searching for #occupy were very different than when searching 
for occupy. The world was amazed at the cleverness of the crowd, but this was 
just a natural response to a signal-detection challenge.
Even with the best tagging, we can still be totally exhausted by discriminat-
ing between individual good and bad memes this way. The cognition of sig-
nal-detection and threshold-adjustment is very effortful. To be ensured that 
we only receive good signal, we are sometimes forced to take a step back 
and manage the entire channels by which we allow you to make demands on 
our attention. Rather than sort through the bytes, we need to scrutinize the 
whole cable. We apply the same signal-detection logic at the channel level that 
we did at the meme level. That is, we ask ourselves whether giving you the 
means to make demands on our attention is worth the returns. In this way, we 
become accountants in the attention economy.
Herbert Simon defined this term in 1971 saying “a wealth of information cre-
ates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently

among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.”vi 
Later in 2002, Davenport & Beck showed us that our attention has monetary 
worth and that it is not to be traded away freely.vii
Recognizing attention channels is the first step to doing that, and the second 
step is assertively approving or rejecting the formation of channels in the first place. 
Each time we give our email address to a commercial entity like yours, each 
time we agree to friend, follow, subscribe, or join you, we establish a channel 
allowing you to make demands on our attention with more memes. The memes 
you showcase are always those that entertain, inform, or in some way provide 
value to us and move us toward our goals. But attached to them like remoras 
to a shark are the persuasive memes, those that are designed to influence our 
attitudes or behavior in a way that helps you attain your economic goals.
With each entreaty to open an attention channel with us, you declare in big 
bold letters that it’s “free,” like the registration page on Facebook (Figure 8-4). 
We may not pay in cash, but we will pay in attention, which is just as scarce. 
The monetary value of attention channels is proven every time restaurants 
and retailers offer cash or discounts for an email address, increasingly under 
the premise that it’s an easy way to send us our receipt. Sorting through the 
ensuing memes is time-consuming and effortful, so yes, we had better get 10% 
off our hamburger for it. If nothing else, the best questions to ask any clerk 
who requests our email address are simply, “Why? What for?”
Figure 8-4. “Free” services and monetary incentives given out for email addresses are 
evidence of their economic value to business.

Chapter 8 | Signal Detection

This was the thrust of Davenport & Beck’s 2002 book. They recommended 
we oversee our attention like an accountant: we alone are in control of it, so 
we should track where it is spent and what we get for it. Attention is transfer-
able, so we deserve transparency in how our attention is resold, like a mort-
gage security to an investment bank. And we may boycott abusive ventures by 
withholding our attention just as we withhold our cash.
■
■Key Point  Businesses should analyze how much they are willing to pay to acquire more 
attention channels (e.g., email addresses) for marketing. Consumers should think about whether 
the financial rewards are worthwhile.
But at the core of it, the worth of an attention channel is determined by its 
ratio of signal to noise. The revolutions in mobile-, social-, and cloud-com-
puting gave us an explosion of new attention channels to evaluate. For many 
of them, we were indeed getting useful memes that were meeting new needs 
fostered by computing on the go. Knowing great restaurants in our area was 
useful, reading reviews outside the front door was useful, and showing a clerk 
a coupon on our mobile devices as we checked out was useful. Therefore, the 
ads that we received through the same channels were largely worth it.
The terms of this attention-for-services trade-off are spelled out in the End 
User License Agreement that we click to accept every time we start using a 
new online service. But ironically, few of us read these EULAs because we 
screen them out with other distracting “false positive” memes. Yet there are 
provisions in EULAs that we may not want to miss. We make ourselves vul-
nerable to attentional demands precisely because we are trying to protect 
ourselves from them.
The new opportunity that more entrepreneurial meme-makers should 
explore is not adding to the attentional channels you have with us, nor pushing 
more memes through the ones you have. The opportunity awaiting innovation 
is to recognize what we said at the beginning of this chapter: we are not passive 
participants in signal detection, we are active. We do not want to receive spammy, 
poorly targeted, shotgun advertisements, nor incur the effort to sort through 
them, any more than you want to pay to send them, or to tell your advertisers 
just how bad the click-through rate is on them. Many companies like Google 
and Facebook are using algorithms to crawl our personal content to improve 
ad relevance, but this still positions us as passive eyeballs staring at a screen, a 
holdover from advertising’s origins in television.
You should instead actively involve us. Make us your partner. Ask us what 
we want to see ads for. Shopping is fun; we like it when we make it our task 
of the moment. Rather than hide your privacy settings where we can’t find 
them, make them a feature that gives us control and lets us express ourselves. 
“Here is what we sense you are interested in seeing ads for [exercise, travel, 

Bottlenecks
93
kayaking, dog sweaters]. Is that right? Feel free to uplevel or downlevel any, or 
shut any off.” As intelligent assistants become a real technology, we can have 
this conversation with them.
Google’s My Activity dashboard has taken the first step to reveal the atten-
tional channels they use in a transparent way. It displays every voice-based 
search term, navigation route, online video, and web site visited, all of which 
they are using to target ads. But take a look at it and try to see how passive it 
still makes us feel. We have incredible brains to focus our attention and man-
age our identities—when will you include our input a high-value algorithmic 
parameter in your model? As long as you are showing us our “algorithmic 
selves,” why don’t you give us the means to manage it?
Perhaps best the way to get the most relevant ads, with the most signal and 
the least noise, and to get us to accept your algorithmic impression of us 
based on our activities in the online village square, is simply to involve us, give 
us more control, and to let us help you to see us as we see ourselves.

Long-Term 
Memory
What is the most powerful reason why we refuse to watch a movie? The 
answer is not the genre, the plot, the effects, nor whether it features Tom 
Cruise. The overwhelming reason why we refuse to watch a movie is that 
we’ve seen it already. A study of 21,000 viewings of 150 movies among 500 
Penn State students revealed that 65% of movies first seen in a theater, and 87% 
of movies first seen as a rental, are never seen again (Rob & Waldfogel, 2006).i
Do a little thought-experiment and imagine how changing just one thing about 
our neurological anatomy would impact an industry: imagine we completely 
forgot a movie about a year after seeing it. Business strategists in digital media 
will tell you that you make more money when user experiences are repeat-
able. That is why, for example, web sites that have you take a personality quiz, 
or services that tell you your genetic history, are a challenge from a business 
point of view: once we have done it, we have little reason to become a return 
customer and do it again. So if we were to forget a movie after a year, we 
would be far more willing to watch it again. And again a year later. Studios 
wouldn’t need to spend as much money making new movies, because people 
would watch the old ones more than once (Figure 9-1). The used-movie mar-
ket would be a year-round cash cow rather than a holiday gift-giving fallback. 
Blockbuster might still be big business.

Chapter 9 | Long-Term Memory
96
But we don’t forget movies after a year. In fact, barring neurological illness and 
given sufficient cues, there is evidence that we remember something about 
a movie for as much as a century. If nothing else, when we start to watch it 
again, we’ll say “oh yeah, I’ve seen this before” for a long time, often the better 
part of our lives. Even when our unprompted recall of movie titles that we’ve 
seen before is low, with prompts, we will recognize that we have, and answer 
“yes” or “no” with more accuracy. And even when recognition is below our 
awareness, our guesses and reaction times in more sophisticated studies still 
reveal that some neural encoding was preserved indefinitely.
■
■Key Point  Our ability to preserve media in long-term memory indefinitely is among the 
reasons why meme-makers must continually produce new content.
In the 1970s and 1980s, psychologists tried to measure the duration of long-
term memory and pretty much gave up. We already mentioned the study by 
Bahrick et al. (1975) in which people could identify schoolmates from their 
photos with 90% accuracy after 15 years and 80% accuracy after 50 years.ii 
Bahrick (1986) also showed that 50 years later, people actually retained 40% 
of the vocabulary words they learned in Spanish class.iii But few memories are 
as vivid as our old school friends, or drilled into us as thoroughly as Spanish 
words, so this doesn’t apply perfectly to memory for your memes. What 
about the new media we are exposed to?
Figure 9-1.  If people were more willing to see movies a second time, studios would need to 
invest far less to produce new ones.

Shepard tested that in an experiment in 1967. He had people flip through 612 
photographs of various scenes, all of them completely new to them. An hour 
later, which would be well after everything in working memory had decayed, 
people were still 97% accurate at recognizing whether photos were new or 
shown previously. More shocking, Shepard brought them back three months 
later and they were still 50% accurate.iv Engen & Ross (1973) did a similar 
test with 100 odors like skunk and whiskey. One week later, people were 70% 
accurate at knowing new smells from previous ones, and a month later they 
were 68% accurate.v
Does this mean that if we spend an afternoon idly flipping through the thumb-
nails on a dating site, we might remember traces of them for a lifetime? For 
the pictures that make it past the attentional and working-memory bottle-
necks, the answer might well be yes.
This anatomical fact that we tend to preserve for a lifetime the memes that 
we allow to colonize our brains has an enormous impact on the business of 
making them. From films to video games to grumpy cats, it means that for 
us to have an engaging experience, we must have a fresh meme. Thus as a 
meme-maker, your objective on most of the days you report for work will be 
to move on to a new product, a new edition, a new release, or a new episode 
in a perpetual cycle of development.
One area of the media market that is exploring whether they can buck this 
trend is streaming video. Among its categories of movies, Netflix has a “Watch 
It Again” section that displays movies that we have already viewed (Figure 9-2). 
Because the cost to deliver this content to the market is so much lower than 
it used to be, there may be some profitability to be found from the minority of 
us who would re-watch a given movie. Netflix would not gamble part of the 
real estate of its interface on re-watching if there were no profitable use for it.
A 2016 study by researchers at Yahoo! found that majority of people, over 
time, do report re-watching something. However, even the most popular 
video in their sample (“The Walking Dead”) was only re-watched by 27% of 
us. Beyond television, the most re-watched movie was “Star Wars,” which was 
re-watched by 10% of us.vi Echoing work done in the 1970s at the height of 
the TV era, the study suggested that genres that depend on surprises (horror, 
sports, and some comedy) are re-watched less than other genres. Because we 
encode plot-twists and jump-scares into long-term memory, our motivation 
to re-watch the movie collapses. But movies that have complex storylines and 
layered themes (drama, action, documentaries, and musicals) did appear to be 
re-watched by at least some of us, particularly if we were doing so to elevate 
our moods or deepen our social ties with others.

Chapter 9 | Long-Term Memory
98
But hang on. Sitting in a movie theater during a late-night re-screening of “Star 
Wars,” the delight you feel might convince you that there is a business model 
to be built on nostalgic content. And to be fair, memes that we’ve seen before 
don’t die instantly in terms of the attention we allocate to them. Instead they 
sputter, and this can sometimes trick you into thinking that there is a reliable 
need you can monetize. But in the long run, we think that’s a ruse. Let us 
explain.
The emotional impact of all digital media derives from its ability to stimulate 
our own organic emotions, experiences, and fantasies. Take the example of 
yearbook photos, those thumbnail photos shot of our schoolmates each year 
and published in various paper and online channels These memes are merely 
visual cues, as are all digital memes, that we associate with something that has 
a real emotional impact on us.
Ivan Pavlov would call a thumbnail a conditioned stimuli and the emo-
tional impact the conditioned response, whereas he would refer to the 
real person the thumbnail represents as the unconditioned stimuli and 
the real emotion he or she brings us the unconditioned response.vii The 
most important lesson he had for the world in 1926, as relevant today as it 
was then, is that the power of memes lies not in their pixels, but in the real 
experiences they recall or evoke. And it never ceases to amaze us how a 
small, impoverished, unrealistic digital meme like a thumbnail or a text can still 
produce a gigantic, rich, oh-so-real emotional response. This connection is a 
Pavlovian association and the foundation of learning and memory.
But here’s the catch: the more we are exposed to the digital stimulus without 
the real thing it represents, unpaired and separately, the weaker our response 
becomes over time. This is called extinction and it begins with the very first 
exposure to the meme by itself and drops off precipitously thereafter, some-
times with only three or four unpaired exposures. So the first time we see a 
yearbook photo we react enormously, because the person pictured, be it our 
best friend, sworn nemesis, or mad crush, is still recently and prominently in 
our lives. But the more we see that person’s digital facsimile rather than the 
person themselves, the more our reaction to the thumbnail wanes to extinc-
tion (Figure 9-3).
Figure 9-2.  Netflix and other streaming media sources are exploring how to monetize re-
watching.

99
But the story doesn’t end there. Pavlov also discovered that if we take a long 
break from the conditioned stimulus, in this case the yearbook thumbnail, and 
then come back to it after a period of say months or years, then our reaction 
is surprisingly large compared to what the extinction curve would predict. 
As Pavlov put it, we have a spontaneous recovery of an extinguished 
response. We have a brief, semi-powerful pop of emotion, proving that our 
long-term memory never truly forgets anything, including extinguished associ-
ations. Sounds great, but Pavlov also discovered that recovered responses like 
this extinguish a second time even faster than they did the first time. And there’s 
the deception: even if you can convince us to watch a movie that we’ve already 
seen, we will lose interest in it the second time even more quickly than we did 
the first time. Even “Star Wars”.
Our psychology professors used to call this the “oldie but a goodie effect”. 
Their point was that although it’s fun to hear that old song again, we still tire of 
it more quickly than ever. But while oldie’s radio stations made for a quaint appli-
cation of extinction, there were hardly any publicly traded companies, venture 
capitalists, or algorithmic mathematicians investing in them. Fast-forward to 
today’s media market, however, and it is once again an open question: will any 
modern-day venture in re-watching nostalgic content succeed?
■
■Key Point  Even though we spontaneously recover our interest in nostalgic content that has 
previously extinguished, our interest extinguishes again even more quickly the second time.
To answer, there is no better case study to explore than that of Classmates.
com, the profitable social-networking success story with its heyday between 
1998-2008. The radiation and extinction of the Classmates meme is a natural

history that every student of internet-based innovation should study care-
fully. Between its founding in 1995 and 2001, as the rest of the web was going 
belly-up during a painful bubble, Classmates.com grew to 20 million users, 
1.2 million of which were paying $29.95 per year to access premium content. 
Then-CEO Michael Schutzler told The Seattle Times that they were adding 
80,000 to 100,000 users per day.viii By 2006, they were reporting revenues of 
$139 million, up from only $85 million the year before.ix
What were we paying for? The ability to see “then” and “now” thumbnails 
of our old school friends, send them an email, and maybe get together for a 
reunion. Classmates built an entire business on the spontaneous recovery of 
extinguished stimuli. In 2015, the CEO confirmed their positioning as such:
Everyone is graduating from high school still, and when 
you hit about that 25-year reunion mark, you notice 
that everyone starts thinking about reunions and you 
get emotional. Of course, you have Facebook friends 
from high school, but Classmates is much more about 
the exploration of the old class and the old yearbooks 
we have. Then you find a few old interesting connec-
tions and find out what happened to them.x
The emotional pop was real for Classmates’ users, enough to convince us 
to pay for its content when we were refusing to pay for almost any others, 
including The New York Times. But when you look closer at the Nielsen numbers,  
you see that the experience quickly extinguished.
In 2006, Classmates users only stuck around for eight minutes every month. 
That’s all it took for the impact of old yearbook photos to re-extinguish. On 
Facebook however, even in those early days, users stayed for 50 minutes every 
month, and this advantage in stickiness alone forecasted an epic takeover.xi 
As users on Classmates continued to burn out on content from the past, 
Facebook encouraged users to bring in content from the present, and by 
2012, Facebook’s monthly active users stayed for a staggering 423 minutes 
per month.xii
In 2007, Classmates attempted to go public, riding on the incredible interest in 
the social networking category by both users and investors. In their SEC filing, 
they showed a crystal-clear understanding of the lack of stickiness inherent 
in nostalgic content, and the incredible stickiness of new and current content.

“Our members do not visit our web sites frequently 
and spend a limited amount of time on our web sites 
when they visit. In addition, only a limited number of 
our social networking members post photographs 
and information about themselves, engage in message 
board discussions, view other members’ profiles or 
participate in the other features on our web sites. If 
we are unable to encourage our members to interact 
more frequently with our social networking web sites 
and to increase the amount of user generated content 
they provide, our ability to attract new users to our 
web sites, convert free members to paying subscribers 
and attract advertisers to our web sites will be adver-
sely affected. As a result, our business and financial 
results will suffer, and we will not be able to grow our 
business as planned”.xiii
Classmates canceled the IPO in December 2007, only a month after filing 
it. They shrunk as Facebook grew, for reasons we will explore further in 
Chapters 15 and 16. Then in 2011, Classmates.com redirected its URL to go 
to MemoryLane.com, not yet learning the lesson that nostalgic content extin-
guishes too quickly to ever sustain growth by itself. Within a year, it redirected 
back to Classmates.com.

Encoding and 
Retrieval
As a maker of memes, you are no doubt buoyed by the idea that your work 
can be preserved forever in our thoughts if it can survive the initial bottle-
necks of attention, perception, and memory. As well you should be! Some 
representation of your app, portal, or service—once we encode it—it may be 
stored for a lifetime.
But we must be able to retrieve your meme from memory if we are to use it a sec-
ond time or recommended to others. And not only must we retrieve the name 
of your brand, often we must also retrieve the password we made when we 
registered for it.
Passwords are perhaps the deadliest UX bottleneck on the web. Apple evan-
gelist Guy Kawasaki listed case-sensitive passwords in his 2007 article The 
Top Ten Stupid Ways to Hinder Market Adoption. He writes, “One of the funniest 
moments of a demo is when a company’s CEO can’t sign into her own account 
because she didn’t put in the proper case of her username or password.”i
Funny indeed, unless you’re that CEO. And never funny for us users. As the 
U.S. population ages and the number of registered services skyrockets, the 
“shared secret” form of passwords (where your users and your database 
both know the same string of characters) has grown so difficult to use that it 
has become an accessibility issue unfairly preventing many of us from engag-
ing important online services, including those sponsored by government. As 
an example of excessive password protection, the Good To Go! automatic

highway-tolling passes sold by the Washington State DOT in 2016 required 
an email, a user ID, a password (entered twice), three security questions (all

to complete this registration and correctly recall all of these passwords was 
slim indeed.

And yet, the hackers who are lying in wait to steal our sensitive data are only 
getting better. Even the dumb ones can use “brute force” software to crack 
seven-character passwords in only .29 milliseconds as of 2015. So requiring 
longer passwords with all of the ASCII characters is necessary, since a eight-
character password takes four months to crack, and a nine-character password 
take 10 years.iii But the longer passwords get, the harder they get to retrieve 
from memory. Especially if we need to refresh them every few months.
■
■Key Point  Taking steps to enable us to retrieve your brand from memory, as well as our 
password to be able to use it, will help increase engagement and word-of-mouth recommendations.
So how can you encourage us to remember the longer passwords that, for 
security reasons, you should force us to make? To understand the neurology 
of memory retrieval and get it to work in your favor, you need to leverage 
your understanding of networks, with which you are already no doubt very 
familiar. With this metaphor, you’ll quickly see how memes are encoded and 
retrieved, and you’ll know how to help ensure we retrieve yours.
As a network, the human nervous system is far more complex than the web. 
Comparing just one brain to all of Facebook, it has more nodes (100 billion 
neurons to Facebook’s 1.79 billion users), and far more links or edges (an 
average of 7,000 synapses per neuron, dwarfing Facebook’s 338 friends per 
user).iv, v, vi Synapses are the connection points between neurons, tiny gaps 
out at the end of branches called dendrites where the signal crosses chemically 
rather than electrochemically. They are ever-changing, just like our followers 
on Twitter. New synapses are formed and multiplied, they combine to either 
turn on or turn off the downstream neurons, and dendrites are fattened or 
shrunk depending on the strength and frequency of the signal, that is, whether 
they are used a lot or only rarely.
For most of the last century, the complexity of networks has daunted psy-
chologists. But in recent decades, their theories are embracing network terms 
and ideas. They now refer to the “pathways” in the brain rather than “areas,” 
the “dynamics” of mental illness rather than “disorders,” and “semantic net-
works” rather than “concepts.”
Memory theorists were among the first to retool their theories using net-
work metaphors. They began by discarding the idea of memory as a con-
tainer. Memory is not a bucket that we fill up any more than a computer 
hard drive is; both store information by making semi-permanent changes in 
connections rather than holding things in a place. And we do not have two 
separate brains for doing and remembering. Instead one brain does both. Thus, 
recalling a memory is really about re-igniting the pathways that were active at the 
moment of the original experience. Seen this way, memories are not movies. 

Chapter 10 | Encoding and Retrieval
106
When we remember something, we reconstruct what it must have been like, 
rather than play a video of what it was like. There may be a few fairly accurate 
images, sounds, and smells sprinkled in, but they are stitched together with 
assumptions.
In sum, new memories aren’t stored and saved, they’re linked in and friended. 
And the more elements we link with them, the more pathways there are to 
retrieve them.
Psychologists might have realized this decades earlier if an oversimplification 
of Pavlov’s original discovery hadn’t obscured it. At the moment Pavlov’s dogs 
were salivating to meat powder, they were not merely associating it with the 
bell, they were also associating it with the shape of the bowl, the colors in the 
lab, the smell of the researcher, his coat and facial hair and tone of voice, and 
even the time of day. In truth, the dogs were networking together all of the 
elements in their immediate environment into their memory. Pavlov knew this 
because he saw the dogs begin to drool when he entered the room. But it took 
until the 1970s for psychologists to recognize that memories are context 
dependent, that is, they are associated with all stimuli in the environment 
(both internal and external) that are present at the moment they are formed.
That means you can use any element that was present at the time we learned 
your meme to help us recall it. Godden and Baddeley demonstrated this viv-
idly on scuba divers in 1975.vii They had the divers learn lists of words either 
on dry land or underwater. When the divers learned them underwater initially, 
they were better at recalling them underwater where it mattered. No special 
effort was needed to improve recall, no tedious repetition, no laborious mne-
monics; the researchers just used the environmental milieu to help reactivate 
the network of memories in which the target memes were embedded. After 
this study was published, scuba instructors promptly started teaching lessons 
at the bottom of swimming pools.
What’s more, you can take steps to enrich the network of retrieval ele-
ments that are present at the moment we encode your meme. This will give 
us more pathways to retrieve it. All you need to do is show one or more well-
learned memories at the same time you present your new meme. Pair a duck 
with Aflac, a gecko with GEICO, and a race car with GoDaddy (or an attrac-
tive race car driver). If you’ve ever watched us trying to recall a brand during, 
say, a focus group, you’ll observe how we think about and even voice aloud 
these retrieval elements. “You know, the insurance company with the gecko, 
and the caveman, and ’the save 15% in 15 minutes’…GEICO!” On a neu-
ral level, we’re igniting well-learned memories in the hope of enervating the 
new memory, leveraging a process known to neuroscientists as spreading 
activation.viii Thus pairing your meme with a “buddy” this way is a far more 
efficient way to help us recall it than, say, repeating “Government Employees 
Insurance Company” over and over.

This is why the best long password is the first letter of an unforgettable phrase. 
Encourage your users to think of a phrase of a hero of theirs and base their 
password on it. Seattle Seahawks’ head coach Pete Carroll says “Stay hungry, 
remain humble, and get better today.”ix Take the first character of every word 
in that phrase (including the unimportant words), sprinkle in some special 
characters, favorite numbers, upper- and lowercase, and a few unique letters 
from the service, and you can have a Facebook password like:
sHrHaGBtFB*5
At 12 characters, hackers would need over 200 years to crack this password 
with brute-force methods.x But it is much easier to remember since it is 
stored with many retrieval elements, that is, rich memories with emotional 
tones, all of which can help us reignite this memory at will.
Taking this idea further, you should leverage retrieval elements to help us 
remember your brand as well as our passwords. With every presentation of 
your meme or your brand, you should encourage your users to actively do 
what Craik and Lockhart in 1972 called elaborative encoding.xi This is an 
active effort to think deeply about a meme so as to maximize the connections 
with existing memories. The longer and deeper we process your meme, the 
more voltage (called action potentials) we route through the network that 
contains it, and this literally helps us grow more synapses and fatter dendrites 
in the pathways leading into your meme.
Encouraging elaborative encoding would be a great help to many campaigns 
on Kickstarter, a site where you seek funding for your inventions from ama-
teur investors who pre-order them. Some of your pitches promote elabora-
tion and good recall, others less so (Table 10-1).

Table 10-1.  Some Kickstarter Campaigns Encourage Visitors to Elaboratively Encode Their 
Meme, Helping to Ensure They Will Recall It Laterxii
Phonemic/auditory processing: Tell us what your meme sounds 
like. The tagline “Jeaux-Racha - One taste and we gotcha” 
demonstrates this beautifully. By contrast, we’re not sure how to 
pronounce MAIIKEstore Café and this limits our ability to recall 
it later.
Structural/visual processing: Pay a designer to make a unique logo 
and icons, and prominently display it so we examine the typeface, 
capitalization, and colors. The Craft Beverage Underground did 
this more so than most.
Repetition: This is the shallowest form of processing, but it helps 
keep memes in working memory longer, which is a baseline 
requirement for long-term encoding. Meadowlands Chocolate 
used the word “Meadowlands” no less than 41 times on its pitch 
page.
Imagery processing: Include pictures of your product, or what using 
it looks like. Without them, we could not have encoded how 
IceLiners layered the bottom of our martini glass with ice.
Semantic processing: Teach us the definition of your brand name, 
its etymology, or how to use it in a sentence. The Comedor 
restaurant pitch did this when they told us it means “dining 
room” in Spanish.

Table 10-1.  (continued)
Association priming: In choosing a name, think about spreading 
activation again. What network of associations does your name 
ignite for us? Is this where you want your meme to be? For 
example, did the BTU Brasserie make us think of a Chinese 
restaurant and craft brewery (which it is), or just the smell and 
taste of propane?
Procedural processing: Encourage us to touch, write, or draw your 
idea. Networked into our memories are plenty of muscular, 
procedural, motor functions, meaning that if you encourage us to 
do anything with your idea, we’ll be more likely to recall it. Have 
us write it, type it (say as a post on Twitter), draw it, anything, 
and that’s one more pathway able to reignite it. SunCreature 
Studio wanted to produce an animated series called the “Tales of 
Alethrion,” and it held a drawing contest as part of its pitch. All 
200 people who sent in entries were assured of remembering 
the project, and the study had cool new content to show in an 
update.
Reworking: Encourage us to put your essential information in our 
own words. Elroy developed Bluetooth ear buds with magnetic 
docking, but they didn’t have a tagline. So they asked for help 
from the crowd. You can be sure everyone who participated 
remembered Elroy, as well as anyone who didn’t join the contest 
but still spent a few minutes pondering some marketing copy.
Locus processing: Tie your idea to a place that people know well 
to co-opt its associations for your idea. Often on Kickstarter, 
local investors buy in to local ideas, which is why there is a 
location filter on the lists. But also use locations to cue us to see 
your idea more vividly. Carrots on Fire pitching sriracha-flavored 
carrot chips sounded yummy, but they missed an opportunity to 
tie them in to a spicy-sounding place in California where they 
came from. By contrast, Stroopwafel Heaven mentioned its Dutch 
origins five times in its pitch.
Self-processing: Tie your idea to the single most prominent 
memory each of us has: ourselves. Too many Kickstarter 
campaigns talk about what “we” want to do with the funding and 
how the plural “you” can help us. But the tagline for the OmieBox 
told us it was “a lunchbox for hot and cold food so you can send 
your kids’ favorite meals.” This doesn’t seem like any special 
genius, but the OmieBox was fully funded with $120,000 from 
almost 2,000 backers. That line spoke to somebody.

The point of all this is that memes that help us tie in to the sticky ends of our 
life experiences will be more easily retrieved (and more memetically fit) than 
those that don’t.
■
■Key Point  Elaborative encoding is actively linking new memes to previously stored memories, 
which helps ensure they will be retrieved. You can encourage us to process your meme more 
deeply in a variety of ways.
Does any of this sound familiar? It should, because by analogy, retrieval element 
optimization (REO?) is a lot like search engine optimization (SEO). For decades, 
online ventures have invested in SEO, linking new web sites with existing ones 
and packing them with detailed text that gives Google’s bots as many search 
strings as possible to find them. REO is just doing the same thing for us, your 
users, and our own organic methods of searching for and pulling up memories.
But curiously, your SEO may be making both of us lazy about doing REO. 
Humans have always relied on external aids to retrieve memes, from scratches 
on stone tablets, to shopping lists penciled on paper, to asking our friends and 
spouses who share our same experiences. Any time we look to another per-
son to recall something, it’s called transactive memory.xiii This used to be 
conceived as a phenomenon of the elderly (“Say darling, what was the name 
of that couple we met on the cruise?”), but it may go much further. In fact, 
Google is rapidly becoming our new best friend.
We are, after all, cognitive misers who only expend the minimal energy suf-
ficient to achieve our goals (in this case, recall). So if we believe an external 
aid can help us access a memory later, there is no reason to do the work of 
encoding it with rich neural connections. “I don’t need to memorize it; I wrote 
it down,” we seem to feel, or “I can ask my husband,” or increasingly “I can 
Google it later.”
Betsey Sparrow, Jenny Liu, and memory guru Daniel Wegner demonstrated 
this powerfully in 2011.xiv They showed 40 trivia statements to college stu-
dents (“An ostrich’s eye is bigger than its brain.” “The space shuttle Columbia 
disintegrated during re-entry over Texas in February 2003.”) and asked them 
to type the statements into a computer, saying they would be tested on them 
shortly. Half of the students were told the computer would save their entries, 
leading them to believe they had a transactive memory partner. The other 
half were told their entries would not be saved, leading them to believe they 
had to rely on their own brains for the test. The former students ostensibly 
neglected to encode the statements very richly, thinking they had a means of 
accessing them through external, rather than internal networks, and when the 
test came they performed significantly worse.

111
Just like senior citizens sometimes have to fly solo without their spouses, 
there is still plenty of argument for helping ensure us, your users, encode your 
meme for retrieval without a device. Despite the rise in social sharing, only 
a fraction of all word-of-mouth is digitized, and thus you will neglect a giant 
chunk of free marketing if you abandon human memory. Driving and other 
activities preclude searching in a safe and convenient way. And although voice 
assistants like Google Now have given us more hands-free access, our work-
ing memory capacity will continue to be capped at times when speed matters. 
(Think of the classic demonstration that no hand-held calculator can outpace 
a third grader who has learned her multiplication facts.)
■
■Key Point  Recent research on the “Google effect” on memory suggests that we make less of 
an effort to elaborately encode information when we feel that online search engines will help us 
to find it later.
Yes, we can always Google something later to get the details we can’t, won’t, 
or shouldn’t try to remember. But what if there are too few retrieval elements 
to even remind us to do a Google search? Another meme falls dead in a silent 
forest, failing to help a user at the moment when it matters.
That’s what happens to meme makers like you when you skip elaborative 
encoding and do only minimal REO. But what is the impact on us, when we no 
longer go to the trouble to memorize things? Is the impact limited to botched 
jokes and tip of the tongue phenomenon when we can’t activate a target 
memory that was too weakly encoded?
No. Ironically, as the ability to search the swarm mind becomes more ubiq-
uitous, hands-free, and even surgically embedded, our ability to store and 
retrieve ideas without the crutch of technology will only be honored more pro-
foundly as a hallmark of personal intelligence. Imagine two candidates for a job:
• 
Candidate one says, “There are some great ideas in this 
healthcare blog I read recently, but I can’t remember who 
wrote it. I’ll Google it later and send you the link.”
• 
Candidate two says, “There are some great ideas in this 
healthcare blog I read recently by Michael Goodheim. 
He lays out some things small business can do which we 
should consider.”
Whom would you hire?
Currently, when we ask our friends questions like, “what year did the space 
shuttle Columbia explode?” many answer snarkily “let me Google that for 
you,” implying they have something better to do with their attention than 
be our transactive memory partner (there’s even a web site lmgtfy.com).  

Chapter 10 | Encoding and Retrieval
112
But imagine instead they answered 2003 without hesitation. Hash tag: #smart. 
In everyday social situations, when we assess others’ native skills and intelli-
gence, we tend to discount them if they appear to have had any sort of assis-
tance or help. The tech giants are in a race to offer us artificial intelligence 
(AI) and digital assistants. But they will have to design and position them not 
to put our own abilities in doubt.
Maybe you don’t like the acronym REO (retrieval element optimization) as a 
counterpart to SEO (search engine optimization). Maybe it activates an asso-
ciation network for you that includes a schmaltzy big-hair rock back of the 
1980s. But you see the metaphor, which we have used to link a new concept 
with existing ones in your memory. Here’s an idea: let’s have a naming contest.

Personality
If your digital creation has made it this far, it has already survived more psy-
chological bottlenecks than many of its competitors. As your users and your 
audience, we have now seen and interpreted your meme and stored it per-
manently in memory with sufficient retrieval elements to be able to pull it up 
at will.
But what about the “at will” part? What makes us want to engage with some of 
your memes and for others be completely unmotivated? Content is king (and user 
experience is queen), but what kind of content appeals to people? Any of you 
who work for big publishers like the Huffington Post, Fox, Patch, Netflix or 
MSN, or for that matter advertise there, know that answering this question is 
key to your career.
That said, you might be making this question harder than it has to be by 
phrasing it the wrong way. Malcolm Gladwell learned this when he set out 
to define what is cool but ultimately concluded that it is what cool people like.i 
Learning from that, perhaps you should redirect some of the time and effort 
you have been putting toward determining what is rewarding, and instead 
focus it on who finds it rewarding. Put another way, concentrate on matching 
your memetic offering to our dispositions (Figure 11-1).
We already introduced the idea of disposition matching in Chapter 2 when 
we advised you how to adapt your meme to our task orientation. We recom-
mended that if you give those of us who have a goal a search field and give 
those of us who have no goal links and thumbnails, then you’ll succeed. Simple 
as that.

In the next three chapters, we extend the basic idea to three kinds of dis-
positions, from the most global and stable to the most specific and momentary 
(Figure 11-2). Analogous to zooming in from the universe to the planet to 
the person, if you start by identifying our personality domains, then our 
developmental stages, then our current needs, you’ll have a pretty good 
idea of who we are and what content we find rewarding—at least enough for 
your writers to take it and run with it.
Figure 11-1.  Individual differences in disposition influence whether we resonate or are 
repelled by the same digital meme.ii

Let’s start with personality matching. Some of us have the profile of prefer-
ences and behaviors across time and situations that will resonate with your article, 
mobile app, music genre, or advertisement. Others among us will be repelled 
by your work because it conflicts with our personality tendencies.
■
■Key Point  There exists no ad, no feature, and no game that will uniformly appeal to us all. Our 
personalities influence whether we resonate or are repelled by your meme.
The prevailing taxonomy of personality traits among psychologists who 
actively study personality is the Big Five model. (Out in the business world, 
you’ll more often hear of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which overlaps 
somewhat with the Big Five, but far fewer psychologists still focus on it.) 
Theorists going back to Freud and Jung have long speculated about the basic 
categories of personality traits, but they disagreed on how many there should 
be, ranging from 3 up to 16 or more.iv Starting in the 1960s with the work of 
Tupes & Christalv and coming together in the 1990s with the team of McCrae 
& Costa,vi psychologists compiled the nearly 20,000 English words used to 
describe individual differences, and they asked huge samples of military service 
men and women to rate whether or not each word described them. This was 
the first time psychologists used data to determine the basic variables that 
comprise personality, rather than theoretical speculation. And again and again 
they found that there are five.

And their names are….um, hang on a sec. This approach to personality was 
so different than the previous ones that psychologists are still having trouble 
naming those five factors.vii It seems no two studies label them the same way. 
The first reason is that the Big Five are personality variables not personal-
ity types, meaning the model does not view someone as “an extravert,” but 
instead we all have “a level of extraversion.” (The scientists in this field spell 
extraversion with an “a” not an “o”.) Personality variables that range from low 
to high like this are better named with adjectives (“extraverted”) than the 
nouns historically used to name personality types (“extravert”). But despite 
breaking free of the pigeonhole categories with their model, Big Five theorists 
inexplicably stuck with nouns (all except Goldberg, who used Roman numer-
als). Next, the Big Five model struggles with the confusing notion of “high and 
low” scores. It’s a little misleading to say we are “low” in extraversion because 
this implies we have a lack of some trait (like we might have a lack of height, 
weight, or intelligence). But the Big Five variables are bipolar, not unipolar, 
so you’re not “low” on something, you’re something else. So rather than say 
someone is “low in extraversion,” which is correct mathematically, we think 
it’s more informative and less neglectful of the opposite pole to say we are 
“more introverted.” Finally, Big Five theorists have puzzled over what to do 
with intelligence. Costa & McCrae argued, and many agreed, that intelligence 
should be taken out of the model entirely, since it’s very different than other 
personality traits and has its own discipline of study. The problem is that one 
of the Big Five variables sits at the intersection of intellect, nonconformity, and 
artistry. So when personality theorists steered away from letting “intelligent” 
and “unintelligent” define this trait, it cried out for a new name as well.
With all that in mind, here are the Big Five personality variables as named 
using bipolar adjectives, which we find most descriptive and useful for the job 
of matching your digital innovations to our dispositions:
Everyone has a score on all five of these personality variables that may fall anywhere 
from…
more disciplined to more casual
more abstract to more concrete
more neurotic to more placid
more cooperative to more competitive
more extraverted to more introverted
Here’s a retrieval element to help you remember: this is the DANCE of per-
sonality disposition matching (taking the first letter of the pair). If your salsa 
meme matches our salsa disposition, we dance. If you play us a polka, we don’t.
Let’s describe the Big Five variables a bit more thoroughly, after which we’ll 
show you how to target those of us who fall near one pole or the other 
(Table 11-1).

To survive as a marketer, designer, or content strategist in the overly competi-
tive memetic marketplace, you need to learn two key don’ts from this table. 
First, don’t ever believe you can launch a “one size fits all” solution for the 
awesomely diverse range of personalities among us. There exists no ad, no 
feature, and no game that will uniformly appeal to us all. Second, don’t just 
develop memes that appeal only to your own personality. In the words of 
Table 11-1.  Descriptions of Both Poles of the Big Five Personality Domainsviii
The more disciplined among us tend to be 
dependable, achieving, and self-disciplined. You 
can spot us because we are neatly dressed and 
punctual, striving to succeed or climb the ladder. 
Take care not to confuse this with neuroticism; 
we clean and strive, not out of worry, but out of 
ambition.
The more casual tend to be spontaneous, 
disorganized, and careless (we like to think 
of it as carefree). You can find us in messy 
clothes with messy workstations, and more 
likely smoking or eating junk food.
The more abstract among us tend to be open to 
new experiences, artistic or literate, and at ease 
with complex or politically unusual ideas. You 
can spot us in higher education settings, voting 
for liberal issues, and getting tattoos.
The more concrete tend to be conventional, 
mainstream, resisting flights of fancy, and 
okay returning to things we know well and 
find likable and comforting. You can find us 
voting for conservative issues and preferring 
domestic over international travel.
The more neurotic among us tend to be anxious 
or easily upset or angered, and to believe the 
world can be a threatening place. You can find 
us worrying about our health and visiting the 
doctor frequently (at times with diagnoses of 
eating disorders, tinnitus, or phobias), although 
strangely we are less likely to take steps to 
protect it. At work, we tend to give “realistic” 
although more jaundiced assessments of risk.
The more placid among us tend to be 
calm, even-keel, and emotionally stable, 
seldom troubled by health concerns. We 
generally think things will turn out okay, 
our emotions show few spikes or dips, and 
we don’t become overly concerned with 
the things others find fearful.
The more cooperative among us tend to be 
sympathetic, considerate, and warm, putting 
others’ needs before our own, and making 
sure there’s always a greeting card or a cake 
for people on special occasions. You can find us 
working well in groups, consoling others who 
are upset, and crafting compromises.
The more competitive tend to be critical 
or quarrelsome, comfortable sparring with 
others over ideas and actions, and okay 
showing aggression. We unapologetically 
put ourselves and our close circle ahead of 
others. It’s not that we don’t understand 
others’ feelings, it’s just that we may 
not give them as much weight as other 
considerations.
The more extraverted tend to seek out people 
and thrills, to be enthusiastic, positive, and risk-
taking. We have been shown to be more likely 
to get into car accidents while driving fast with 
loud music. Don’t mistake our sociability for 
kindness, however, since being extraverted and 
cooperative are orthogonal personality traits. 
The more introverted tend to seek solitude, 
work independently, and be reserved, 
quiet, and reflective. We feel that being 
with others is “draining,” and although we 
are better listeners than most and can be 
perfectly competent on stage, we’ll tell you 
that we “recharge our batteries” alone.

usability guru Jakob Nielsen, “you are not the user.”ix Your disposition does not 
represent our dispositions, one or all.
What is the Big Five profile of your users? Learning this information may be 
very strategic for you if you run an ad-supported site, as you’ll be able to tune 
your algorithm to increase the likelihood that your users resonate with the 
ads they see, rather than be repelled by them.
Initially, you might think it is impractical to ask all of your users to take a per-
sonality inventory, but this is exactly where you should aim. The data will enrich 
your algorithms substantially, and we are getting increasingly accustomed to 
sharing with you our preferences upon registration, or via a promotional email 
sent just after registration. Begin by saying “Please tell us a little more about 
you so we can personalize your experience and show you less distracting ads.” 
(More of us will answer to remove a negative than to obtain a positive.) Then 
shorten the questions to these ten,x which you should ask people to rate from 
strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5) with the order scrambled.
I see myself as someone who is…
dependable, self-disciplined (D1)
disorganized, careless (D2)
open to new experiences, complex (A1)
conventional, uncreative (A2)
anxious, easily upset (N1)
calm, emotionally stable (N2)
sympathetic, warm (C1)
critical, quarrelsome (C2)
extraverted, enthusiastic (E1)
reserved, quiet (E2)
Calculate the scores as such:
High is disciplined, low is casual = (D1 – D2 + 6)/2
High is abstract, low is concrete = (A1 – A2 + 6)/2
High is neurotic, low is placid = (N1 – N2 + 6)/2
High is cooperative, low is competitive = (C1 – C2 + 6)/2
High is extraverted, low is introverted = (E1 – E2 + 6)/2
Of course, not all of your customers will respond. But once you try to get 
as many of your cookied users to answer, ask a data scientist to create a 
­mathematical look-alike formula (using regression or Baysian modeling) to 
impute the likely personality profile of the rest of us based on the ads, features,

and content we engage with most. But don’t stop asking us directly; it’s hard to 
say whether you’ll improve your ad performance better with 100% accuracy 
on 25% of your customers (via surveys) or with 25% accuracy on 100% of 
your customers (via modeling). So try both.
If you create a “recommend other products that we may like” feature, you 
can display a more refined set of options that is liked by people with similar 
personalities. As importantly, you can write persuasive messaging that better 
speaks to our personalities.
Does it work? Research on the relationship between personality and response 
to marketing advertisements is still in its infancy, but in 2011 students in the 
University of Washington’s Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE) 
program asked 100 people to rate 15 advertisements after answering a  
21-question personality test.xi The results are shown in Tables 11-2 and 11-3.

The results of this study are intriguing for two reasons. First, they suggest that 
disposition matching can help you get better performance from your ads. But 
reversing that, they also showed that advertisements can be another way to 
assess the personalities of a large user base. People who click a Hummer ad 
can be flagged as more concrete, whereas people who click a scuba diving ad 
can be flagged as more extraverted. With enough clicks, highly predictive big 
data models can be created without any survey at all.
■
■Key Point  Knowing our personalities will improve the rates by which we click through your 
ads. And conversely, knowing which ads we click through can help you learn our personalities.
But using banner ads is only the beginning of the possibilities. It turns out the 
Big Five also predicts our music preferences as confirmed in parallel studies 
done in Brazil, The Netherlands, and England.xii The results of this research tell 
you which genres of music you should advertise with on sites like Pandora and 
Spotify in order to target the personalities who will like your work the best.
If your meme is best matched with…
the more disciplined, then advertise with pop music
the more casual, then advertise with rock and metal
the more abstract, then advertise with classical, blues, 
jazz, or rock and metal (we’re open to anything)
the more concrete, then advertise with country and 
roots music

Chapter 11 | Personality
126
the more neurotic, then advertise with indie rock (ironi-
cally sometimes known as “complaint rock")
the more placid, then advertise with rap
the more cooperative, then advertise with any genre 
(anything is fine; we’re agreeable)
the more competitive, then advertise with metal and 
some indie
the more extraverted, then advertise with rap and blues 
(anything with a heavy bass or that’s meant to be 
played loud)
the more introverted, then advertise with classical
It’s not hard to take this a step further and hypothesize which personalities 
use which web sites, mobile apps, and content categories. Here are some pre-
dictions based on scads of studies about the Big Five model in general.
More often than people with other personality scores, we predict that…
The more disciplined use productivity tools, read exer-
cise and health content, and take part in educational 
and self-teaching webinars.
The more casual gamble and play more games of 
chance, are into vices like smoking and alcohol, and 
more often visit sex classifieds.
The more abstract consume more liberal content and 
visit sites for higher education, art, politics, and travel.
The more concrete consume more conservative 
content.
The more neurotic visit animal welfare sites and want 
to learn their credit scores.
The more placid don’t resonate with advertisements 
using scare tactics.
The more cooperative give online to charities.
The more competitive watch sports and extreme sports, 
and enjoy comedians with more “biting” humor.
The more extraverted research amusement parks, sky-
diving, and adventure travel.
The more introverted read books and book reviews, 
garden, and run triathlons.

We hope this stimulates more academic research in this area, but rather than 
wait for that, you can do a personality matching study any time as part of your 
overall media plan, algorithm tuning, product roadmap, or SEO efforts.
Personality changes very little over time, so matching this disposition is the 
easiest since you can append this metadata to individual users among us. 
Psychologists have found that the personalities we show at age two are indica-
tive of our adult personalities, and after age 30 we settle into a set of Big Five 
scores that is stable for the rest of our lives.xiii
By contrast, the next set of dispositions you need to match change over time, 
albeit slowly. These are our developmental stages, which is the subject of the 
next chapter.

Developmental 
Stages
As you just saw, matching your digital value propositions to our personality 
traits goes a long way toward motivating us, your audience and customers, 
to engage with it. We each need to feel that your meme “is for people like me,” 
which is a key survey question in brand research and one that indicates that you’re 
doing well at disposition matching. If your meme doesn’t make us feel this way, 
we move on, looking for those that do.
The same can be said of developmental stages, the next most stable form 
of human differences. Whereas our personality traits stay the same throughout 
our adult lives, developmental stages represent the tendencies and existential 
foci that change as we mature (Figure 12-1).
The richest definition this was given to us by Erik Erikson around 1959, one 
of the first developmental psychologists to pay attention to the entire lifespan 
from the cradle to the grave.i His idea was that we pass into and out of all-
consuming existential questions as we age, somewhat like we drive into and out 
of radio broadcasts on a long road trip. The deep questions we ask ourselves 
about the direction our lives are headed start off as being of little concern, but 
slowly become critical to us, and afterward simply fade in importance as they 
are resolved and we mature out of them. The eight Eriksonian questions 
(with approximate ages and percentages of the U.S. population) adapted for 
our uses here are as follows:
1.	 Can I rely on others? 0-1 years; 2%
2.	 Can I do it myself? 1-2 years; 2%
12

Chapter 12 | Developmental Stages
130
3.	 Am I good or bad? 3-5 years; 2%
4.	 Am I good at something? 6-12 years; 12%
5.	 Who am I? 12-19 years; 10%
6.	 Can I share my life? 20-39 years; 30%
7.	 Do I matter? 40-64 years; 30%
8.	 Can I die in peace? 65+ years; 12%
Figure 12-1.  Our chronological age is a predictor of the existential questions we face at 
different life stages, which produce diverse interpretations of the same experience.
Don’t let the brevity of this list fool you into underestimating how profound 
it is. Erikson’s life stages read like the acts of an epic film, and the deeper you 
dive into any one of them, the more a world of human drama opens up.
■
■Key Point  Memes that helps us answer the existential questions specific to our life stage will 
be motivating and rewarding to us. Memes that address questions outside our life stage will feel 
irrelevant.

We begin life born developmentally premature compared to other mammals 
(the fault of our huge crania, which at first we can’t even lift off the floor). In 
our first year as we go from helpless to walking, we either learn we can trust 
others to survive (question 1), or we learn that we’re on our own. Establishing 
our social network may be our first life lesson. (At the same time, our parents 
learn whether they are up to the job of being caregivers.) But on the heels 
of learning to trust others, and now literally up on our own heels, we next 
demand autonomy (question 2), using our brains and muscles as they come 
online to do what they were made for. (Learning collectivism is immediately 
followed by learning individuality.)
Now we are acting beings, doing things, going places, running, and we instantly 
collide with the morés of our culture, its dos and don’ts, rights and wrongs, 
and insistence on where we can and cannot make a mess. So we next become 
obsessed with whether we are good or bad (question 3), and no one lets us 
go a day without facing that question. Coming into our tween years, most of 
us resign ourselves to being good, but now we want to be good at something 
(question 4), so we constantly make up games and compete and measure 
ourselves against our peers. Soon all these skills and competencies and pref-
erences begin to (question 5) coalesce into an identity and we find we must 
answer the question of who we are, trying on and discarding identities as fast 
as we change clothes, cliques, and hair color. (This is perhaps the worst life 
stage to get a tattoo, albeit the most common.)
Overlapping this stage in a fundamentally frustrating way, we also begin to 
wonder if we can be with someone else forever (question 6), to find true love, 
and our life becomes defined by the edict that you can’t love another until you 
find yourself, neither of which we have mastered. Then one day the question 
of staying with someone forever, once such a seeming impossible mountain 
to ascend, is suddenly the status quo and we enter the longest stretch of our 
lives where we spread genes and memes and try to help them survive and 
propagate as we help ourselves stay relevant and to matter (question 7).
Then into retirement we go, consumed with the question about whether our 
time, our work, and even our kids are worthy enough to make us proud that 
we used our mortal days on them (question 8). We satisfy our omissions and 
rectify our commissions in an existential battle to replace regret with fulfill-
ment, and we help others at an earlier stage on the same journey, hopefully 
coming to feel okay about the eventual end.
That may be a long-winded description, but it is still an insultingly pared-
down account of the life and struggles of humans. Nevertheless, Erikson was 
firmly on point, and here’s the point for you: these eight questions are your 
first guide to knowing what content is rewarding to us. We want content and 
products that help us answer the existential question of our development stage. And 
we’ll pay for it with our attention and our money.

Chapter 12 | Developmental Stages
132
Your task is simple: locate your users on this list by their age, then adapt your 
messaging to align with the existential question that they are thinking about 
morning, noon, and night. Here are the Eriksonian questions again with the 
companies that do just that (keeping in mind that the buyer for products at 
the first four stages are more often a caregiver than the user):
1.	 Can I rely on others? Pampers, Carter, Graco
2.	 Can I do it myself? LEGO, Crayola, Melissa & Doug, Baby 
Einstein, LeapFrog
3.	 Am I good or bad? Disney, Marvel
4.	 Am I good at something? Nike, Gatorade, Sprite, PlayStation, 
Xbox
5.	 Who am I? Vineyard Vines, Apple iTunes, Facebook
6.	 Can I share my life with another? Match.com, eHarmony, 
Tinder, David’s Bridal, The Knot
7.	 Do I matter? University of Phoenix, Microsoft, Forbes
8.	 Can I die in peace? Ancestry.com, Expedia, AARP, Carnival 
Cruises
The internet has proven essential to answering every one of those questions 
with content and services.
The first question, can I rely on others?, is actually the most interesting, because 
we face it both at the beginning of life (as an infant) and at the time life repeats 
itself (as a parent). Within minutes of learning we are expecting a child, many 
of us find ourselves on Google searching what others can teach us. Or we 
grab our phones and text our social support network, in essence seeking 
assurance that they’ll be there for us. Thus, at the same moment a new baby 
asks us if he or she can rely on us, we’re turning to our close intimates and the 
wider internet and asking if we can rely on them.
The best toys answering the next question, can I do it myself?, are those that 
enable children to learn about their own capabilities. Cheap computing power 
has produced generations of interactive electronic toys sold to caregivers 
with the almost irresistible value proposition that they will provide their chil-
dren with educational stimulation, a claim more often made than tested. But 
aside from filling landfills with non-rechargeable batteries, many of these toys 
lie around unused while children spend hours playing with a string of beads, 
a strip of cloth, or a stick. How do computerized toys end up less engaging 
than a stick? The answer might be that any toy that requires programming is 
a closed system limited to a few types of input and some pre-determined out-
puts, whereas non-programmed toys are open systems with unlimited inputs 
and outputs, not to mention malleable rules the kid can change on a whim. 

Bottlenecks
133
The point is that children at this stage want to learn what they can do, not 
what the toy can do, and thus a simple open-system toy will still answer this 
life question best. Watch for this struggle as consumer robotics evolve, with 
LEGO following the successes of Furby and Aibo by making more investments 
in toy robots with artificial intelligence.ii The moment a child is observed to 
tell a robot toy “no, let me do it” like they have told so many parents over the 
millennia, we will know the robotics have gone too far. At the very least, we 
can expect the robot to be lying unused in the corner the next day—another 
meme killed by user-selection.
One can scarcely overstate the number of movies, cartoons, video games, and 
animations that engage children obsessed with the next life-stage question, 
am I good or bad? A dead giveaway is the size of the characters—small good 
protagonists (Powerpuff girls, Pikachu, Sonic) facing grown-up sized or larger 
evil opponents, overcoming the obvious power differential with fantasy skills 
and capabilities. Sounds like the world of a child. Why don’t the good charac-
ters just remain in their magical powered-up state all the time? Because they 
must return to the size that resonates with child viewers, only to repeat the 
storyline again and again.
When asking themselves am I good at something?, children have tradition-
ally looked to physical skills and sports. But increasingly, virtual skills in video 
games have been shown to answer this existential question perfectly well. 
They also conform to the fantasy of an extraordinary hidden power able to be 
unleashed any time circumstances warrant. Just as news content didn’t need 
physical paper to be delivered, and music didn’t need vinyl, skills don’t require 
a physical ball, field, goal, or uprights. By 2013, children were filling arenas 
watching video sports and logging hours watching Twitch just as their parents 
watched NFL in the other room.
The year 2016 saw the first collegiate e-sports scholarships in the United 
States at Robert Morris University, who offered e-athletes the same deal as 
the basketball and football players, but also made them practice just as hard.iii 
Winning is winning to those of us faced with this existential question—the 
gymnasium is incidental.
Some brands at some points in time—like Apple or Volkswagen or Death 
Row Records—are so strong that we use them to answer the fifth question, 
who am I?, regardless of what the product is. I’m a Mac … and I’m a PC. The 
theme of a wildly successful Apple ad campaign early in the millennium spoke 
the language of adolescents so well that many Gen-X and Gen-Yers defined 
themselves by their operating systems. A well-worn marketing strategy lever-
aging this identity question is to first convince urban youth to adopt your 
product, and then cross over to the far more numerous kids in the suburbs 
who aspire to be that cool. Tommy Hilfiger and Burberry were stagnating 
as clothes for tennis players until they perfected this motion. Interestingly, 
sometimes meme-makers fight in vain against the who am I implications of

buying their product.iv In 2006, representatives of Louis Roederer, makers of 
Cristal champagne selling at $300 a bottle, became aware that their product 
had become the drink of choice among the hip-hop elite in, for example, the 
VIP sport lounges run by Jay Z, entertainer and executive of Def Jam records. 
Cristal still thought of itself as the “oldest cuvée de prestige in the Champagne 
region,” made originally for Tsar Alexander II in 1876, so it resisted becoming 
the moniker of the new “bling lifestyle” and said so.v A boycott ensued, some 
hip-hop stars bought Dom and Krug instead, and everyone eventually settled 
back into an acceptable answer to the question, who am I?
Polls taken in 2014 showed that the first thing nearly 30% of newlyweds did 
after getting married was to change their relationship status on Facebook,vi 
in this way answering the who am I question as someone who can share my 
life with another. Relationship building needed the internet more than anyone 
realized, and the internet delivered.
The Pew Research Center reported in 2016 that 22% of Americans aged 
24-35 used online dating, and of the married people at that time, 5% had 
met online.vii Internet dating was one of few online verticals whose user base 
actually grew younger over time, rather than older. But what about everyone 
who was only halfway through this stage and not ready to answer yes to this 
Eriksonian question? The internet provided for them as well. By 2013, about 
12% of all Americans were telling Pew they enjoyed adult content online 
(about 25% of men watching any online video at all).viii Many people wondered 
if these figures were too low due to falsifying, and Pew had asked the question 
a half-dozen different ways, not finding a radically different percentage since 
2005. Perhaps the reason only a sixth of Americans are found to enjoy porn 
is because only a third are in the developmental stage where they are preoc-
cupied with mating (broadly defined).
What kind of content appeals to people preoccupied with the seventh ques-
tion, do I matter? This book. A book about how to make your memes matter 
to more people. As with every business bestseller and online article containing 
the words innovation, disruption, or digital revolution. Those of us in this devel-
opmental stage also cannot resist the various “influencer scores” as found on 
Klout, LinkedIn, or Bing. These are some of the cheapest-to-produce memes, 
easily derived from SQL queries or network algorithms and able to be tacked 
on to almost any digital product, and they are like catnip to those of us in this 
stage. We want our tweets to be trending, to be an influencer on LinkedIn, 
have a high author rank on Amazon, and have more views on YouTube. And 
when we want those digital status symbols and metrics to be even higher, we 
pay real money for conferences, trainings, and university degrees.

In the last stage, as we ask can I die in peace, research has indeed shown that 
we will suffer more regret from the noble things we did not do (omissions) 
than from the ignoble things that we did do (commissions).ix The internet and 
mobile computing have made it so easy to travel the world and fulfill our 
“bucket list” that we can’t blame lack of information for our regrets of omis-
sion, though we too often can blame a lack of resources.
But those of us with too little funds to travel can now bring the world to us 
instead, offering up our couch to travelers from other continents eager to 
book it (the site Airbnb derived its name from air-bed and breakfast, confirm-
ing you don’t have to have much to join the fun). As well, genealogy sites like 
Ancestry.com were early successes on the web; when social media went 
mainstream, we could connect with living relatives as easily as those of the 
past.
■
■Key Point  Identify the Eriksonian questions faced by your user base and pivot your value 
propositions and product positioning to address them.
The point of all of these examples for meme-makers like you is that if your 
brilliant idea for a digital product doesn’t meet one or more of these existen-
tial needs head on, it might fall through the barstools and founder. Consider 
pivoting your product and your positioning to nail these—you’ll sell more and 
actually help people on their way.
Another key lesson is that you need to tune up the age group you’re advertis-
ing to, matching it to your product. If you’re trying to push content too early 
or too late for your audience’s existential focus, you’ll be no more successful 
that trying to turn back time.
For there is an intimate relationship between matching these existential 
questions and the attention that we’ll devote to your work, our all-powerful 
weapon of user selection. We—who consume your content and use your 
memes—we need to hold a high bar, since every hour we spend with you has 
an opportunity cost and risks the regret of not doing something else. The user 
selection pressure we apply to your inventions stems not just from the scar-
city of our attention, but also the scarcity of our years. We will need to look 
back and say those hours, days, and years on social media, or gaming platforms, 
or acquiring status symbols (degrees, account balances), or publishing our 
thoughts (from top ten lists to TED talks), or staring at an iPad or into Oculus 
Rift…were worth it. Content is king, but more importantly, content is human. 
Disposition matching is as much about humanizing us, helping us, and viewing 
our lives and needs as richly as possible, as it is about spreading memes.

Needs
In the last two chapters, you saw how you’ll get nowhere with your business if 
you offer karaoke to introverts or genealogy to teens. You have to match your 
digital ads and apps to our personalities and life stages or you won’t survive 
the bottlenecks of disposition. Sure, you could instead shotgun out your work 
to the population as a whole, but it is guaranteed that in doing so you’ll waste 
more time and money than competitors that engage in better disposition 
matching.
Targeting our life-stage questions and personalities is easy since they change 
very slowly or not at all. But our needs shift the moment they are satisfied. 
Despite this volatility across time and situations, it is no less important for you to 
match them too. If you try to offer “cool selfie after-effects” to someone who 
is worried about paying the rent at that moment, you’ll understand what we 
mean.
How do you identify what needs your work fulfills for your users? You’ll need 
to use some big-data modeling techniques. Hire a market research analyst that 
offers psychographic segmentation and here’s what they will do for you.
The analyst will start by asking you to list every single action and value propo-
sition that your users might perform or achieve while using your product. A 
fully-functional social media web site with content, searching, profile formation, 
and sharing tools might easily have a list of 150 statements or more, each ide-
ally starting with an active verb like “edit my profile photo,” “post comments,” 
“rate comments,” etc. To this list you can add some more abstract, higher-level 
needs like “promote my business,” “connect with people,” or “organize my 
life.” While you’re at it, throw in 10 statements covering our personality ten-
dencies and another eight representing our life-stage questions.
13

Chapter 13 | Needs
138
When you’re done preparing this list, the analyst will have you field a survey 
to about 1,500 of your users (a good ratio is about 10 respondents per state-
ment), asking us to simply rate on a five-point scale how much or little we 
need or want to perform every one of those actions or realize every one of 
those value propositions. Choose carefully whom you field this survey to: your 
premium-paying users might have a different profile of needs than your non-
paying users or your prospective users. You may need to separately survey all 
of these groups.
The analyst will then retire into their statistical laboratory (with a mad-sci-
entist laugh) and perform two modeling steps: factor analysis will look for 
groups of similar needs out of the original batch of 150, and cluster analy-
sis will look for groups of similar people when it comes to those needs. The 
analyst isn’t going to do this with sticky notes and subjective opinions, oh no. 
Instead they’ll use statistical techniques that let the data tell them the basic 
“hooks” of your product and the “segments” of like-minded users you have.
But before you spend the money to do this (it ain’t cheap), you should start 
with a prediction of what it might reveal. Despite the ultra-modern ques-
tion “what psychographic needs are fulfilled by my digital meme?” the most likely 
answer was already known in 1943 by psychologist Abraham Maslow. Maslow 
was the intellectual nephew of Sigmund Freud (Maslow’s mentor was Freud’s 
contemporary Alfred Adler, a psychological giant himself) and thus his meth-
ods were more humanistic than statistical. That is to say he observed closely 
and thought deeply rather than collected data and analyzed it. But Maslow 
also had an intimate understanding of the great range of human needs as 
the son of Jewish refugees who fled the persecution of czarist Russia only to 
raise Maslow in poverty in New York. From this background, Maslow came 
to believe in a hierarchy of needs (Figure 13-1) that can be summarized as 
follows:
Only after we satisfy our…
physiological needs (food, drink, temperature, sleep), do 
we turn to our
security needs (of our bodies and our employment, 
family, and property), then to our
belongingness needs (affiliation, acceptance, affection), 
then to our
esteem needs (status, approval, recognition), and finally 
to our
self-actualization needs (entertainment, knowledge, 
creativity, meaning, fulfillment)

In all likelihood, after you put your best data scientists on the task of learn-
ing what your customers need from your innovation, and after they apply the 
most cutting-edge statistical techniques, they will return to you and report 
that there are these five foundational needs, give or take.
■
■Key Point  If you hire data analysts to perform a psychographic segmentation of your users’ 
needs, in all likelihood it will reveal the five types of needs in Maslow’s 1943 theory.
That’s what happened in 2011 when T-Mobile performed a psychographic seg-
mentation of mobile phone users (Figure 13-2).ii The groups that emerged 
mapped onto Maslow’s hierarchy quite well. (The names that T-Mobile chose 
for each segment are shown in parentheses). They learned that we use our 
mobile phones to meet…
physiological and security needs, by being able to call for 
help while on the go (“911 Minimalists”)
belongingness needs, by being able to reach spouses, 
children, or other relatives (“Family-On-Calls”), and 
by taking pictures and sharing them with messaging or 
social networking apps (“Socializers”)

esteem needs, by buying the latest phone as a status 
symbol (“Tech-Heads”)
self-actualization needs, by staying productive at work, 
while also playing music and games (“Professional 
Balancers”), or just working (“Workaholics”)
Psychologists of course quibble over whether there are two, four, or seven 
of these basic needs, and so should you, acknowledging that you’re not con-
cerned with the whole of humanity, only your users. So if you have enough of 
a population to survey and enough money, don’t just take Maslow’s word for 
it, perform that psychographic segmentation.

Figure 13-2.  Psychographic segmentations of a mobile carrier, a cooking community, and a 
travel company all yielded Maslow’s needs.
The cooking web site Allrecipes.com also matched Maslow after their  
psychographic segmentation in 2008 (Figure 13-2).iii They found that we use 
food-themed sites such as this to meet…
physiological needs, by learning how to cook something 
edible to all, or edible by people with dietary restric-
tions (Learners)
security needs, by hurriedly feeding our families on 
hectic days (Providers)

Bottlenecks
141
belongingness needs, by creating a profile and sharing 
recipes with others (Networkers)
esteem needs, by throwing an awesome dinner party 
that our friends compliment (Entertainers)
self-actualization needs, by enjoying the culinary arts 
and learning about new organic ingredients from 
around the world (Foodies)
One stark lesson that psychographic segmentations reveal is that we aren’t 
just ambivalent about features that meet needs we don’t have, but in fact we 
loathe them and find them annoying distractions. Those of us who use cooking 
sites to make life-or-death dietary choices or provide for impatient families 
have absolutely no interest in making a profile, sharing recipes, and getting 
wine pairings. Whereas for others among us, the belongingness and esteem 
needs are what bring us to the site. To us, delighting our friends at a dinner 
party or even pulling off a Fandango wedding feel just as essential, and we 
won’t give a hoot about the nutrition information.
These strong feelings derive from a principle that Maslow called prepotency. 
This means that we only care about the higher needs if our lower ones are met. 
Now, although it may be true that you can find counter-examples (like a 
starving artist who meets her self-actualization needs before her physiologi-
cal ones), in general, this motivational principle is every bit as unforgiving to 
your meme as were the bottlenecks of attention, perception, and memory. 
When more basic “needs are unsatisfied,” wrote Maslow, “all other needs may 
become simply nonexistent or be pushed into the background…The urge to 
write poetry, the desire to acquire an automobile, the interest in American 
history, the desire for a new pair of shoes are, in the extreme case, forgotten 
or become of secondary importance.” This explains why we won’t care to 
make a profile on a cooking site if we’re just trying to cook for serious health 
conditions. And why we won’t want to play Flappy Bird on our phones if they 
aren’t functioning well enough to even call 911 or roadside assistance.
■
■Key Point  Psychographic segmentations performed by a mobile carrier, a cooking community, 
and a travel company all replicated Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.
Maslow’s hierarchy also applies to travel and tourism services. In 2011, a psy-
chographic segmentation was performed by People To People International,iv 
the educational travel company engaged by President Dwight Eisenhower to 
send high-school aged “student ambassadors” abroad in 1963. The parents of 
the student travelers (who paid the bills) used People to People to meet their 
kids’…

Chapter 13 | Needs
142
physiological and security needs, by providing meals and 
ensuring their safety (Selectives and Vetters)
belongingness needs, by letting them travel with old 
friends and familiar teachers (Group Travelers)
esteem needs, by giving them good material for college 
applications (Scholarship Seekers)
self-actualization needs, by having authentic cultural expe-
riences and being broadened intellectually (Experiencers)
You’ll notice that the needs met by both People To People International and 
T-Mobile mash physiological and security needs together. This is because many 
industries (such as service, travel, or tech) don’t help us get food, oxygen, and 
water. They assume rightly that no one would be a prospective customer if 
their physiological needs were not already met.
But this brings up an important point: what does it mean if you perform a 
psychographic segmentation on your users and find that your business is not 
meeting some of our needs?
It might reveal an opportunity for expansion. Content-based services like 
news aggregators and streaming video sites can almost always climb Maslow’s 
pyramid and add functionality to meet our belongingness, esteem, and self-
actualization needs. Once you have a good number of users, give us the ability 
to make profiles, friend or follow others, and send direct messages to help us 
feel connected to others and accepted by them. A few months later, add rat-
ings of the content that we post and reputation/activity scores to boost our 
sense of esteem and accomplishment. These easy digital status symbols can be 
launched with very little costs to you, but they are as compelling to us as any 
other symbols of social approbation (remember, we’ve been earning ribbons, 
certificates, plaques, and trophies since grade school).
Another benefit is that we will go to great lengths to protect these status 
symbols from disappearing after we earn them, including staying active on the 
site for no other reason. Finally, add games. These may be a loose interpreta-
tion of self-actualization features, but they give us the one thing we look for 
when we have everything else: fun. To be sure, not everyone will use these 
features. But those among us who do will have a broader array of needs met, 
stay engaged longer, stimulate the community, and provide content for others 
to consume.

Facebook is a service that is actually expanding downward in Maslow’s hier-
archy: it was originally created to meet our needs for belongingness, esteem, 
and actualization, and was largely irrelevant to our basic physiology and safety 
needs. The University of Washington Master of Communications in Digital 
Media (MCDM) programv performed a psychographic segmentation of 
Facebook users in 2012. They found that we use Facebook to meet…
belongingness needs, by letting us join interest groups 
based on politics, art, and music, and using Facebook 
Connect to link to other web sites (Fans)
and by keeping connected to the events of family and 
friends, primarily birthdays, despite being unmotivated 
by the other things to do on the site (Neutrals)
esteem needs, by building a personal identity, a com-
mercial brand, and accumulating social capital often 
with the private forms of communication (Branders)
by sharing videos, links, and good deals with others 
and preferring public posting over private messaging 
(Influencers)
self-actualization needs, by learning about news, media, 
and entertainment topics, as curated by our own 
network (Social Searchers), and by playing games, 
using apps, and wining coupons (Gamers)
More recently, however, Facebook and its rival Twitter are meeting more basic 
physiological and safety needs. Twitter has become the de facto AM radio dur-
ing natural disasters and political upheavals, thus truly playing a life-or-death 
role for its users.
Perhaps Facebook could also do more to ensure its utility among us when we 
are at our moments of most extreme need. A particularly extreme example 
occurred in July 2016 when Diamond Reynolds live-streamed the aftermath 
of the shooting death of her boyfriend Philando Castile by police. The sad and 
profound aspect of this is that Ms. Reynolds likely launched the service feeling 
that it would help save her own life.
At the other end of the needs spectrum, the philanthropy potential of Facebook 
has been proven again and again, most recently with the “ice bucket challenge” 
raising millions for ALS disease in 2014. Could Facebook play a larger, more 
formal role in raising money and routing resources around the globe? At the 
very least, if it built features related to finance and payments, a great launch 
strategy would be to embed them in a narrative of charity and giving.

Chapter 13 | Needs
144
But if your meme is like Facebook and mainly dedicated to the highest of 
Maslow’s needs so that we only turn to when everything else is satisfied, you 
might need to take disposition-matching one step further and focus on our 
wants. If you have matched our personality and life-stage dispositions, and met 
our immediate needs, then it is time to think about helping us have fun. We 
haven’t entirely dodged the what is fun? question, which we take up in the next 
chapter.

Fun
What is fun? Here’s a formula offered by former Disney theme-park designer 
and video-game mechanics guru, Jesse Schell (Figure 14-1)i:
fear - death = fun
Well, that’s certainly one way to put it. Expanding, he means that a thrill ride 
(like a roller coaster or a zip line or even a first-person shooter video game) 
is an experience where actual threats to our physiology have been mini-
mized, even though we still feel threatened. It’s a little like distorting Friedrich 
Nietzsche’s famous aphorism to say “that which does not kill me only makes 
me more amused.”

Chapter 14 | Fun
146
In much the same way, hard-core human needs like air, water, food, and our 
full ten pints of blood are seldom at risk when we use digital memes, nor are 
they provided by them. Thus, meeting the most basic physiological and security 
needs that Maslow defined may not set your meme apart from others (most 
memes don’t live or die depending on whether they help us actually live or 
die). As well, meeting our belongingness and esteem needs may not elevate your 
meme, especially games, since almost all of them tell us how we are scoring, 
and a great many let us play with others. You are sunk if you fail to meet any of 
these needs, but meeting them alone may not be enough to win our attention.
Since most memes and games sit on top of Maslow’s hierarchy, used by us only when 
all of our other needs are met, it will still be fun that determines which species thrive 
and which become endangered. So, what is fun? What kinds of different things 
do people find rewarding?

■
■Key Point  Game designers, not psychologists, are leading the way in advancing our 
understanding of what is fun.
Paradoxically, during the heyday of behaviorism from the 1940s to the 1970s, 
when psychologists were obsessed with rewards and had their best chance 
of mapping this landscape, they actually refused to define what is rewarding, 
focusing instead on the right timing of rewards. They were just trying to be rig-
orous: they didn’t want to speculate on the nature of things that they couldn’t 
see (emotions), preferring instead to work with what they could (behavior). 
So they gave us a uselessly tautological definition of a reward: anything that 
increases behavior to acquire it.
That’s not very fun.
Later, psychologists realized the limitations of this view. One example of a 
reward that was pretty hard to explain without diving into the black box of 
emotions involved the cats of behaviorist Edward Thorndike.ii (Each behavior-
ist had his favorite animal. Ivan Pavlov liked dogs. John Watson liked rats. B.F. 
Skinner liked pigeons. But Thorndike liked cats. If he lived today, he would 
probably laugh really hard at a lot of grumpy cat memes.) Like his contempo-
raries in 1911, Thorndike had been using food to reward his cats as he studied 
how they learn. But bedeviling his efforts was the fact that the cats kept jump-
ing out of his puzzle boxes. One day Thorndike set up a lever that the cats 
could use to free themselves (Figure 14-2). Thereafter, the cats enthusiastically 
“increased their behaviors” to get this new reward, that is, they learned really 
difficult maneuvers simply to be freed from the box.
The rewards here were not food, water, sex, or more pleasant temperatures, 
that is, the lowest physiological needs in Maslow’s hierarchy. Instead they 
seemed to find freedom rewarding, or the problem-solving needed to achieve 
it. This was one rung up on the needs ladder, and perhaps the first time behav-
iorists had to face a motivation that looked at least a bit more like….fun. Soon 
they were finding they could reward dogs with toys and chimpanzees with 
fake money,iii and the internal world of cognition and emotion got increasingly 
hard to ignore.

Chapter 14 | Fun
148
But nonetheless, the next few decades still failed to produce a taxonomy of 
fun. When behaviorism fell out of vogue and psychologists finally embraced 
the unseen, inner forces on our behavior, they grew new disciplines like cogni-
tive, personality, developmental, and motivational psychology. Although most 
of what their behaviorist predecessors discovered has never been disproven 
to this day, and are eminently applicable to digital experiences (we’ll get into 
their best lessons starting in the next chapter), they were wrong about one 
thing: scientists can indeed see psychological forces beneath the skin, skull, and 
overt behavior. It just took more clever scientific methods and better neural 
imaging to “operationalize” them for observation and study.
But even with these advances in cognitive science, did we get a theory of 
fun? Unfortunately not. The cognitive revolutionaries who shelved behav-
iorism were held back by a different problem: they were too serious. Even 
Maslow’s topmost self-actualization need as he outlined it did little to explain 
our widespread search for fun or the importance it has on our economic 
decisions. In fact, Maslow often argued that only a few truly enlightened peo-
ple like Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi experienced this peak form 
of experience.v Not much room for fun there. We’re not sure visionaries like 
these had a lot of fun, and we’re definitely sure they wouldn’t have whiled away 
much time playing Flappy Birds.
So with so few helpful psychologists to guide meme-makers, perhaps it is time 
we introduced some meme-makers to psychologists.

Take for example young Pierre-Alexandre Garneau, who in 2001 had just 
graduated with a computer science degree from the Université Laval in 
Quebec. While looking for a job as a game designer, he wrote an article for 
Gamasutra.com titled “Fourteen Forms of Fun.”vi This was no ordinary inter-
net list, primarily because it was one of the first typologies of fun that many 
people had ever seen. Sure, others had developed typologies of games and 
game mechanics, also uncovering lessons of interest to psychologists. But 
Garneau turned it around because he was in the business of inventing entirely 
new games. He wanted to first understand all the things folks like us found to 
be fun and then make games to fulfill us, rather than take the games that had 
already been made and put them into buckets.
His approach found an open niche and spread wildly. By 2004, Garneau’s 
forms of fun was being taught in the workshops of the San Jose-based Game 
Developers Conference, and game-design experts Robin Hunicke, Marc 
LeBlanc, and Robert Zubek made it part of their Formal Approach to Game 
Design and Game Research.vii That same year, the Michigan State University 
Communications department added two more forms of fun and published 
a typology of both casual and educational games.viii In keynote speeches at 
other conferences during that time, Jesse Schell of Disney extolled Garneau’s 
insights and the productive directions that it opened up in game design.ix The 
discipline of funology was born, complete with a 2003 textbook by the same 
name.x
Here are the forms of fun in our own words, put in a way you can tell your 
boss and apply to your memes. Garneau gave us the first 14; Hunicke, LeBlanc, 
and Zubek contribute 15 and 16; the Michigan State researchers 18 and 19, 
Jesse Schell 19 and 20, game theorists Gunn et al. 21 and 22, and the last two 
come from traditional psychology.

selves (be lucky)xii
What should you do with this list? Make your meme more fun, whether it be 
in the engineered product or your product marketing. Treat it as a hypothesis 
and experiment with it. Gather a group of creative people together and start 
the conversation with a form of fun: “Okay, let’s design a meme, whether a 
game or an article of original content, that helps people experience the fun of 
[tidying up or a different form of fun].”
Read through this list and think about how you can infuse some fun into your 
existing meme, taking care to first assess whether it will align with task-posi-
tive users or task-negative users, whichever you are targeting. Use AB testing 
(or ABCD..X testing) to find out which works better. Perform a cluster analy-
sis to determine which collections of fun are engaging to the same people. 
And don’t be surprised if this ends up correlating with personality traits.

But let’s say you don’t think any sort of “gamification” is right for your meme, 
and many don’t. You should still consider implementing some form of graphi-
cal reward for the actions you want us to take. We have shown ourselves to 
be surprisingly responsive to design elements that for you are incredibly inex-
pensive to make. A great example is the graphic that appears on our LinkedIn 
profiles with an animated line that rises to a certain height like a thermom-
eter, representing how much content we’ve uploaded into our professional 
profiles (Figure 14-3). A graphic like this motivates us to increase our “profile 
strength,” which is a win for both us and for LinkedIn.

If there is one thing the early behaviorists got right, it was to observe that we 
“increase our behaviors” to attain symbolic rewards that are very far removed 
from primary reinforcers like food and sex. Indeed, we strive to acquire 
any symbolic secondary reinforcers that we associate with real, physiologi-
cal rewards by virtue of being present at the same time. The classic example 
is monetary: a holiday feast is a primary reinforcer, and we work, strive and 
compete for one. But we work just as hard for currency, which is a secondary 
reinforcer we associate with the feast. And we work just as hard to increase 
a balance displayed on our online banking account, which we associate with 
both currency and the feast. For many of us, our eyes dilate and our heart 
rates spike on payday when we log in to our bank accounts and see a new 
direct-deposit entry in our ledger, just as it would if you put before us a holiday 
turkey.
■
■Key Point  Implementing a graphical secondary reinforcer in your meme, which we strive to 
obtain because we associate it with primary reinforcers, will make your app more fun.

Chapter 14 | Fun
152
Thus as a meme-maker, there is almost no cost to you, and a lot of potential 
benefit, if you implement a digital secondary reinforcer in your innovation. 
Examples abound, from Likes we receive on Facebook, to the “cha-ching” 
sound of a cash register that we hear on our smartphones whenever some-
one contacts us about an item we are selling on the OfferUp app.
Secondary reinforcers can symbolize a wide variety of primary reinforcers 
that span several of Maslow’s needs. Some we associate with physiological 
needs (pictures of food), some with security (the padlock icon showing that 
a “https” web site uses secure socket encryption), some with belongingness 
(Likes), some with status (star-ratings), and some with pure fun (GIFs). If you 
make games, you can also design secondary punishers, which we will strive 
to avoid just as hard as we do to avoid primary punishers. And secondary 
punishers can also span Maslow’s needs, symbolizing threats to physiology 
(weapons, teeth), to security (traps), to belongingness (getting kicked off or 
kicked out of a group), to low status (badges indicate we are “nubes”), to the 
absence of fun (frowny-face emoticons).
Perhaps the most successful secondary reinforcer appeared on Foursquare, 
where a graphic element dubbed us the “Mayor” of a venue if we had checked 
into it more than anyone else in the last 60 days, symbolizing a kind of status 
(Figure 14-4).
Figure 14-4.  Badges encouraging us to check into venues on Foursquare more than anyone 
else in the last 60 days, dubbing us the “mayor”.

When we are asked why we strive so hard to attain these secondary reinforc-
ers, knowing that they benefit companies as much or more than ourselves, you 
can guess what we answer:
“I don’t know, it’s just kind of fun.”

Schedules of 
Reinforcement
Your meme—your mobile app, social media service, or video game—is now 
beginning to be quite advantaged over its competitors. You have optimized 
it to survive the bottlenecks of attention, perception, memory, and disposi-
tion, and if you have done so, we have rewarded you by engaging with your 
invention.
We clicked.
Well. Once anyway.
Since it’s a lot of work to get us this far, you should now consider how to get us to 
click again. And again. And ultimately leave your app running all day. Experts in 
operant psychology have known since the 1950s how to motivate us to do 
that, and that is the subject of this chapter.
■
■Key Point  Increasing the frequency of our visits and clicks raises your ad revenue far more 
quickly than increasing users.

Chapter 15 | Schedules of Reinforcement
158
A quick business lesson on how you’ll get rich while we use your invention: 
don’t charge us for your meme, give the experience to us for free and re-
sell our marginal attention. Users like us have shown that we prefer to pay 
with attention rather cash, and since pure attention won’t buy your grocer-
ies, exchange it for some of the $190 billion and rising that companies are 
pumping into digital ads each year.i We users know the terms of this business 
model, “if we aren’t paying for the product, we are the product,” and we agree 
to it only because we are equipped with powerful psychological bottlenecks 
that ultimately let us command our attention for our greatest good. And if you 
wonder whether you’ll actually be able to earn enough revenue this way to 
pay yourself and your shareholders, just ask Google, Facebook, and The New 
York Times.
That’s the strategy, now for the accounting: you’ll need to calculate how much 
attentional inventory (also called ad inventory) you have available to sell to 
advertisers. This determines how much money you stand to make.
You don’t simply multiply the number of users you have by the number of ads 
you can squeeze onto each page. Rather…
Total attentional inventory =
the number of ad placements per page
X the number of unique users per month
X the number of visits per user
X the number of clicks (ad reloads) per visit
So if you have one ad placement and one user who visits once each month and 
clicks one page (or scrolls, or swipes, or in some way gets served only one ad 
and never reloads the ad displays), then you have one ad in your inventory to 
sell. But if that user visits twice in a month, your ad sales can instantly double. 
And if that user clicks twice as many pages on your site during his or her visit, 
your ad sales double again.
Mathematically, increasing any of the four boldfaced factors by one increases 
your total inventory by the product of the other three factors. That means, 
and this is crucial, that increasing the visits and clicks catapults your ad sales far 
more than increasing the number of users.
Turn back the clock to April 2010 and see how Facebook mastered this to 
reach a multi-billion dollar valuation. According to Nielsen,ii Facebook at that 
time had 400 million unique active users each month. This was a lot, although 
not nearly what it would have later, but what really set it apart was that at that 
time each Facebook user visited 11 times per month on average, and on each 
visit, we reloaded ads by clicking new pages an average of 59 times. Although 

Bottlenecks
159
these metrics also had plenty of room to grow, they were already astronomi-
cal compared to, say Classmates.com, which had only one visit per user per 
month and a paltry 10 page clicks per visit. But plug Facebook’s numbers into 
the attentional inventory formula, and you really see the power of increasing 
frequency (visits) and stickiness (clicks):
With 400 million users in April 2010…
When Facebook encouraged just one additional visit 
from its users (from 11 to 12 per month), it sold an 
additional 23.6 billion ads, equal to Myspace’s entire 
inventory at that time.
When Facebook encouraged just one additional page 
click each visit (from 59 to 60), it sold an additional 4.4 
billion ads, equal to Twitter’s entire inventory at that 
time.
But when Facebook got one additional user to join the 
site, it sold only an additional 649 ads each month.
That’s right, for Facebook to add another entire Myspace to its business port-
folio, it just needed one more visit from us. And to add another entire Twitter, 
it just needed one more page click. And that’s exactly what it got.
How did Facebook do it? It took advantage of the timing of rewards as much 
or more than what constituted rewarding content.
This was another straightforward application of college-level psychology. The 
psychologist who knew the most about the timing of rewards was Burrhus 
Frederic Skinner (B.F. to his friends), as described in his 1957 book with C.B. 
Ferster.iii Together, they tested hundreds of different schedules of rein-
forcement, or different timing patterns of rewards, working with pigeons and 
rats in special boxes that were hooked up to early computers. For example, 
they made the rats push a lever five times for every food pellet, or 10 times, 
or 100 times, or alternate between 10 times and 100 times, or a random 
number of times. Or Skinner and Ferster altered the computer stopwatch so 
that the pellet was only available every five minutes, or every 20 minutes, or 
every 100 minutes. Or they shut off the rewards altogether and watched how 
long it took for the rat to give up pressing the lever, that is, for the behavior 
to extinguish.
They recorded every stimulus schedule and documented every response. It 
would be another 40 years before the trillion-dollar consumer-internet and 
gaming industries would be in full swing, but what Skinner and Ferster learned 
watching mice click levers applies perfectly to what we now know about peo-
ple clicking mice (Figure 15-1).

Chapter 15 | Schedules of Reinforcement
160
Before we divulge which schedules they discovered to be the most potent, as 
your users, we need to just come out and say that the lessons in this chapter 
are so powerful that they’re scary. This particular chapter is at the apogee of 
an awkward tension that’s been here all along: implementing this psychology 
will turbo-charge the power of your meme and go a long way toward ensuring 
the fiscal success of your venture. At the same time, we as users must deploy 
our best neurological defenses against the forces of operant psychology to

ensure we stay in command of our goals. “Addictive” can be the highest com-
pliment paid to a digital meme, often said only of those with peak memetic  
fitness, but due to the inherent competition between genes and memes for the 
scarce resource of time, “addictive” can also be the worst life-sucking regret 
for a user. Everyone, meme-makers and users alike, need to understand the 
schedules of reinforcement that Skinner and Ferster saw inside the mechani-
cal boxes in their labs; otherwise, this will all degenerate into “revenge of the 
rats.”
Here are the mechanics at the heart of it: Skinner and Ferster observed two 
schedules of reinforcement that yielded the highest rate of checking and click-
ing (Figure 15-2).
Variable interval reinforcement

time until reward is available

Figure 15-2. The variable-interval reinforcement schedule increases visits.
The first is the variable-interval reinforcement schedule, where there is 
an unknown amount of time before rewarding memes are available. All schedules 
with the word “interval” in the name are based on time (not clicks), thus as 
long as the user makes at least one click after the time interval ends and the 
reward has become available, any number of clicks before or after that has no 
influence on when he or she gets the reward. Skinner and Ferster tested both 
fixed intervals, where the amount of time was regular and learnable by users, 
say a pre-set 5 or 10 minutes, and variable intervals, where the amount of time 
was random within a range, say anywhere from 0-10 minutes. Users quickly 
learn fixed intervals, and they settle into a sawtooth pattern of clicking that 
peaks around the time the interval is due to end while resting in between to 
conserve their attention and effort.

Chapter 15 | Schedules of Reinforcement
162
Users immersed in variable, unknowable, interval schedules realize that they 
might win the reward at any moment, so they continuously visit, check and 
click to find out if the reward has arrived. This is what encourages users to visit 
your meme many, many times each day and greatly increases your ad sales. Web 
analytics measure it as “frequency,” and we users experience it as FOMO, or 
“the fear of missing out.”
Some examples: in general, these digital features reward users on a variable-
interval schedule with an unknown amount of time before pleasurable memes 
become available:
• 
One-to-one messaging (texting, email)
• 
One-to-many user-generated content (UGC, social media 
posts, email)
• 
Breaking news
• 
Deals and coupons
• 
Online auctions and bidding queues
• 
Inventory sites (e.g., real estate listings)
• 
Scores during a sporting event (e.g., goals, touchdowns)
Because users don’t know when these types of pleasurable content will appear, 
we tend to visit and check these features often, even continuously. Therefore, 
implement any of these features to increase the frequency statistics of your 
digital meme (Figure 15-3).

actions until reward is available

The second is the variable-ratio reinforcement schedule, where an 
unknown amount of actions are needed to obtain rewarding memes. The word 
“ratio” in the name indicates these schedules are not based on time, but 
rather actions (clicks, swipes, scrolls, taps, or any action that reloads the con-
tent and the ads). Again, there are both fixed ratios where a regular, pre-set 
number of clicks are needed, say 5 or 10, and there are variable ratios, where 
the user cannot know the random number of clicks needed to obtain the 
reward because it varies within a range. Here again, users quickly adapt to 
fixed ratios and make the required number of clicks in short bursts or sine 
waves, resting in between.
Users immersed in random, unknowable, variable-ratio schedules have only 
one option—click and keep clicking until they find something rewarding. This 
is what encourages users to view more pages and therefore ads. Web analyt-
ics experts call this “stickiness,” and we call it “addictiveness.” Which reveals 
another outcome of variable-ratio schedules: people take a very long time to 
extinguish clicking after the rewards cease altogether. When the task becomes 
impossible, or no further rewarding content is to be found, users in a variable-
ratio schedule have a hard time learning to quit. They keep trying long after 
there is anything to be gained by doing so.
In general, these digital features reward users on a variable-ratio schedule with 
an unknown amount of clicks needed from users to uncover the pleasurable 
content:
• 
Internet lists (where each list item is displayed on its own 
page)
• 
Thumbnail aggregators (e.g., Pinterest, Medium, porn 
aggregators)
• 
Profiles on dating sites
• 
Many actions in maze games or physics games (e.g., secret 
switches or paths, the trajectory you choose to shoot in 
Angry Birds)
• 
Almost all games, and in particular casual games, or 
­gambling games of chance
• 
Walls and feeds
Because users don’t know how many clicks are needed to find the content 
most pleasurable to them (including the right actions to win a game), we tend 
to click and scroll a lot and resist extinction even when there is nothing of 
interest left to find. Therefore, implement any of these features to increase the 
page views on your meme, a.k.a. “stickiness.”

■
■Key Point  When there is an unknown amount of time or actions we must take before rewarding 
content appears, our visits and clicks will increase dramatically.
Facebook’s astronomical rates of frequency and stickiness was attributable to 
the fact that they implemented both of these schedules of reinforcement in a 
multitude of forms. We visited the social utility so very often—at home, work, 
even while driving—to the point that we just left it running all day on both 
our PC and mobile device, because there was an unknown amount of time 
before a friend messaged us or made a post. Since it could arrive any moment, 
we checked repeatedly.
Facebook was also one of our most-used news sources, and we didn’t know 
when headlines would break reporting a shooting, a disaster, a new product 
from Apple, or a scandal. Still others among us played casual games with others 
on Facebook, whether friends or strangers, and we didn’t know when a new 
move had been made or our high score had been beaten. When we decided 
to turn our attention to Facebook and pull it up, sometimes because we had 
a few minutes to spend, other times spending longer than we intended, we 
scrolled and clicked on piece after piece of content because we didn’t know 
many we would need to look at to finally see something provocative. We 
didn’t know how many times we needed to expand a post or click through to 
read one before we uncovered something that was truly funny, touching, or in 
some way rewarding.
The result was that by 2014, 65% of us who were registered on Facebook visited 
it daily, spending 21 minutes per visit on average. Over 29% of us left it run-
ning all day on our smartphones, and 27% of us were checking while driving.iv 
Much of the same was true of Instagram and WhatsApp, but Facebook owned 
those properties as well. Turning to YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest was no 
different. The founders of YouTube said that HotOrNot.com was one of their 
inspirations,v a low-budget site popular early in the millennium where you 
rated thumbnail pictures of people, bringing up the next thumbnail with each 
click, click after click, until you saw someone who was indeed hot in a perfect 
example of a variable-ratio schedule.
In the same way, they designed YouTube to show you an array of related 
thumbnails as soon as the video ended, creating a variable-ratio rabbit hole 
that many of us fell down for a long, long time. Borrowing from this strategy, 
even reputable news sites like ABC News and Business Insider triggered pop-
ups teasing the next article as soon as we scrolled to the end of our current 
story, prompting us to make another click.

165
For those of us who yearn wistfully for a romantic past before digital media 
existed, sorry, variable-ratio and variable-interval reinforcement schedules 
were with us all along. The gambling and games of chance that have been 
found in human cultures for centuries is another example of variable-ratio 
schedules, as was fishing, hunting, and gathering roots and berries before 
that. Engaging with these schedules of reinforcement and being entertained, 
delighted, frustrated by, and addicted to them, is as old as human nature itself 
and in some ways as germane to it. Thus it is no surprise that the power of 
these schedules of reinforcement in digital media are so reliable that any suc-
cessful property will almost certainly have them.
Sometimes, but not often, a variable schedule will be set up unintentionally, 
and is better off dismantled. An example, old enough to now only be of aca-
demic rather than practical interest, was that early versions of the Microsoft 
Outlook email client, when paired with early email servers (some university-
mainframe or POP accounts) would not automatically download incoming 
emails. Instead we needed to click Send/Receive manually.
A perfect variable-interval schedule formed, in which we did not know the 
length of time before an email was available, and so we clicked Send/Receive 
often. Too often—and almost continuously when we were expecting an 
important email from a professor or love interest. As you can guess, we loathe 
variable schedules when we are in a task-positive mindset (Chapter 2) and 
trying to get other things done (although we welcome them when we are in 
a task-negative mindset). Later versions of Outlook did away with this prob-
lem, automatically receiving emails, and popping a “toast” notification, easing 
the addictive burden on its users (Figure 15-4). Notifications break variable 
schedules by making the unknown known. No longer were we left to guess 
when a new email had come—the toast told us.

Chapter 15 | Schedules of Reinforcement
166
This logic brings up an interesting point about Facebook. When they email 
notifications to us that a friend has liked or commented on a post of ours, they 
actually reduce our frequency of visits by making an unknown time-interval 
known. The incredible stickiness of their service could actually be increased 
even further if they did away with the emails, which would also reduce their 
costs. Granted, a new startup might not want to take such a step, as they may 
need to remain top-of-mind until we are good and hooked. The question for 
Facebook is, do they notify us so as to dial down the addictiveness from what 
could be an unpleasant level? Or do they just don’t know this is holding them 
back? Or do they need to remain top-of-mind themselves? Or is there some 
other reason altogether?
No discussion of the milder “marketing” usage of the word “addictive” would 
be complete without acknowledging the clinically-significant impairment, bet-
ter referred to as dependency or abuse. We cannot give this topic its full 
due here, except to note that throughout the 1990s, psychologists in the 
United States debated whether to acknowledge gambling addiction as a true 
disorder, just as throughout the 2000s they debating the inclusion of video 
game and “internet” addictions.vi We think that the inability to extinguish 
Figure 15-4.  Early versions of Microsoft Outlook with some email servers required that we 
(a) manually click Send/Receive, (b) resulting in a download dialog box and a variable-interval 
schedule. This was removed and replaced with automatic downloads and (c) desktop “toast” 
notifications.

responding in variable reinforcement schedules is a commonality across all 
behavioral dependencies. We also believe, following mental health fundamentals, 
that anyone who feels “distressed, disabled, or at risk” of unwanted outcomes 
with friends, family, or work, due to overuse, should seek help and is more 
than deserving of treatment.
Certainly, the neurological pathways underlying substance dependencies must 
at a minimum be very different than the pathways involved with digital depen-
dencies, but one need only read the DSM diagnostic criteria for substance 
abuse to see there are strong parallels.vii The verb “to use” may be differ-
ent when talking about substances versus digital media, but the signs bear an 
uncomfortable resemblance.
Answering yes to three of the seven criteria suggests that further discussion 
with a healthcare professional is warranted.
• 
Tolerance. Has your use [of drugs or alcohol] increased 
over time?
• 
Withdrawal. When you stop using, have you ever expe-
rienced physical or emotional withdrawal? Have you had 
any of the following symptoms: irritability, anxiety, shakes, 
sweats, nausea, or vomiting?
• 
Difficulty controlling your use. Do you sometimes 
use more or for a longer time than you would like? Do 
you sometimes drink to get drunk? Do you stop after a 
few drinks usually, or does one drink lead to more drinks?
• 
Negative consequences. Have you continued to use 
even though there have been negative consequences to 
your mood, self-esteem, health, job, or family?
• 
Neglecting or postponing activities. Have you ever 
put off or reduced social, recreational, work, or house-
hold activities because of your use?
• 
Spending significant time or emotional energy. 
Have you spent a significant amount of time obtaining, 
using, concealing, planning, or recovering from your use? 
Have you spend a lot of time thinking about using? Have 
you ever concealed or minimized your use? Have you 
ever thought of schemes to avoid getting caught?
• 
Desire to cut down. Have you sometimes thought 
about cutting down or controlling your use? Have you 
ever made unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control 
your use?

Chapter 15 | Schedules of Reinforcement
168
This lays bare a truth about our neurological bottlenecks that protect us from 
unwanted memes that must now be acknowledged: To this point we have por-
trayed our bottlenecks as almost insurmountable for you as a meme-maker, 
and as unbending and unforgiving as steel. But in fact, focusing our attention 
and allocating our energy toward our goals is not easy. Like muscles, the tissue 
we use to do so must be exercised or it will atrophy, and it can be overpow-
ered, strained, and disabled.
We’ll repeat something we said earlier: you meme-makers are not the only 
ones with goals. Our psychology is simultaneously your rules for success and our 
protection from exploitation. That’s why we must continue our search for truly 
rewarding memes, not just those fed to us with irresistible timing.

Escalating 
Commitment
The last chapter showed that the timing by which you deliver your digital 
memes matters as much to your success as the content itself. Sequence ampli-
fies substance, so to speak.
So let’s explore the power of sequence and timing a little further.
Some of the most important digital interfaces you’ll ever build for us are (a) 
the initial registration and download sequence for your app, and (b) the check-
out sequence. Sitting in your garage with your starry-eyed developer friends, 
you probably won’t think of these at first, concentrating instead on the core 
part of your meme that fulfills our needs or is fun or interesting. But at some 
point, you’ll need to monetize, and that means building a UI flow to enable 
us to register (thus setting up an attentional channel) and/or pay you money 
(checkout). These moments of truth are called conversion flows, because 
they convert us from one state to another, as from an unregistered to a reg-
istered user, or from a free to a paying user. Here is an example of a conver-
sion flow once seen when we were subscribing to The New York Times online 
(Figure 16-1). As you can see, conversion flows almost always have multiple 
steps—at minimum, one screen to convince us to join, and another to confirm 
our identity and perhaps take our payment information.
The sequence of these screens and the textual copy you write on them is crucial to 
ensuring we finish. Screw this up and you’ll turn us away right at the moment 
we’re opening our brains and wallets to you.

Chapter 16 | Escalating Commitment

You can anticipate getting into a debate with your business partners, perhaps 
the first real debate of your fledgling startup: one of you will notice that 
people drop out with every step, something that is common to all conver-
sion flows, so he or she will logically feel that the fewer steps the better. But 
another partner, usually with a marketing background, will argue you need to 
woo people a bit, prove the value, and retain some extra steps or screen space 
for that purpose. Ultimately, it is a good question worth debating: why don’t you 
just ask for our email address and credit card number on the first screen?
Figure 16-1. A conversion flow used to register visitors to The New York Times online 
content. Step (a) mentions free services, (b) lists the value propositions, (c) establishes 
identity, and (d) is a confirmation.
If the debate gets heated, don’t feel bad. The same argument rages at internet 
giants from Amazon to WhatsApp. They pour huge sums of money into “con-
version rate optimization,” the professional discipline tasked with tweaking 
these screens and testing whether doing so increases the ratio of how many 
of us complete the flow divided by the number who start it. This is a well-
paying job you might consider for yourself, since you will be a trained memetic 
engineer by the end of this book.
■
■Key Point  Why don’t you ask for an email address and a credit card on the first step of a 
conversion flow, since people drop out with each additional step?

No doubt, this same debate took place in 2001 at Classmates.com, the first 
profitable social networking site dedicated to high school reconnection that 
we mentioned in Chapter 9.
Part of Classmates’ success, as MarketingSherpa learned in a 2001 interview  
with then-CEO Michael Schutzler, was that “Every single element of the 
Classmates site and landing pages that you can possibly imagine has been rig-
orously tested and retested, including colors, exact wording, typeface, graph-
ics… number of registration steps … and even how the steps in the registration 
process are numbered (or not.)”i
Knowing that, it may be somewhat mysterious to you why the initial reg-
istration flow for Classmates.com had a ghastly number of seemingly 
unnecessary steps (Figure 16-2). Let’s count them:
	1.	 Choose your state where you graduated from high school.
	2.	 Choose the first letter of the city where you went to high 
school.
	3.	 Is your city one of these? Choose it.
	4.	 Choose the first letter of your high school.
	5.	 Is your high school one of these? Choose it.
	6.	 Wow! X thousand people from your high school are reg-
istered on Classmates.com! Fill in this form to join them!
	7.	 Click the link in your email to confirm.
	8.	 You’re confirmed! Want to be a (paying) Gold member…
here’s why you should! (The main value proposition for 
many years was to be able to email others via the site.) 
Choose your plan (a month, a year, two years).
	9.	 Great! What’s your credit card info?
	10.	 Confirmed! What are your email preferences?
	11.	 Super! Fill out your profile!

Chapter 16 | Escalating Commitment
172
Choose the first letter of your high school? Why didn’t they just put in a 
search field? Better yet, with autocomplete?
Math quiz (with fake data): Let’s say only 5% dropped out at each step of this 
flow (which would actually be awesomely low), then out of every 100 who 
began it, how many would join? How many would pay? How many would 
make it all the way and complete a profile? Answer: 63 would make it to step 
eight, 56 to step ten, and 54 through step eleven. Needless to say, Classmates 
wanted more of us to get through.
Figure 16-2.  Classmates.com circa 2010.

173
And by 2003 or so, autocompleting search fields were becoming a reality. 
Around that time a coding technology called AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript 
and XML) had emerged that let you directly call server-side objects like pages 
and web services. AJAX let you get rid of many submit buttons in a conver-
sion flow, and also eliminate the long, blank page refreshes of traditional server 
calls. Classmates’ developers were by no means wrong to suspect these pauses 
were annoying to us in our task-positive effort to register, and that a certain 
percentage of us was churning out with each one.
So on firm logical grounds, and using AJAX to autocomplete our entries and 
remove several submit buttons, they ostensibly tried all sorts of experiments. 
Imagine one variation could compress the first five steps of the flow to one 
step, like this:
	1.	 Enter the first few characters of your high school into 
this search box.
	2.	 Wow! X thousand people from your high school are reg-
istered on Classmates.com! Fill in this form to join them!
	3.	 Click the link in your email to confirm.
	4.	 You’re confirmed! Want to be a (paying) Gold member…
here’s why you should! (The main value proposition for 
many years was to be able to email others through the 
site.) Choose your plan (a month, a year, two years).
	5.	 Great! What’s your credit card info?
	6.	 Confirmed! What are your email preferences?
	7.	 Super! Fill out your profile!
Recalculating with only 11 steps not 7 (assuming the constant 5% dropout 
rate), now out of every 100 who started, 81 should join, 74 should pay, and 70 
should complete a profile. That would indeed have been much better.
But that’s exactly what didn’t happen. To their bewilderment, the number or us 
who finished the flow actually got worse when it got shorter. As MarketingSherpa 
put it, “Nothing’s beaten the control so far.” How do we know for sure? Go 
to http://classmates.com right now and look how their registration is 
designed (Figure 16-3). Despite testing “every single element of the Classmates 
site,” it has not changed from the 1998 design. By 2003, Schutzler must have 
given up testing alternatives when he said, “very few companies have ever 
been successful by going straight for the subscription.”ii

The point of this story is not to teach you to fear failure, nor to discourage 
you from multivariate testing, which every venture should implement from day 
one in the garage. Optimizers only roll out their test variations to a fraction 
of their traffic, so you can easily turn off the test and go back to the old flow. 
No harm done. But what psychological process could possibly explain why a 
longer flow would be better than a shorter one?
The reason is escalating commitment.iii This is a pattern of behavior, 
observed by psychologists at least back to the early 1960s, in which a series 
of several minor behavioral commitments and small reinforcements can produce 
behavioral outcomes that we would otherwise refuse to perform if we are asked all 
at once.
When we visited Classmates, the site at first asked us merely to click our 
state. Then the first letter of our city. We thought what could be the harm 
of that? These were minor commitments that resulted in small reinforce-
ments: it displayed our hometown. This was itself rewarding; we essentially 
thought well, at least they have my town in their database. Many of us were 
already smiling.iv Then the flow asked for the letter of our high school, display-
ing that result. Oh, it has my high school. By this point, the site had only asked 
for three clicks, completely anonymously, and the results appealed squarely to 
our sense of self-processing (from Chapter 10). Then, learning how many

175
of our schoolmates had joined was yet another reward, and also triggered 
our belongingness needs (from Chapter 13). By the point were we asked 
to provide an email address and trade anonymity and attentional demands for 
further content, we were ready to do so.
In most alternative flows that Classmates might have tested, there was likely 
to be less of a slow give-and-get leading up to that trade. The shortest logical 
flow would abruptly ask us to cough up an email address on screen one. But 
ultimately, even with the churn caused by so many clicks in the longer flows, 
far fewer of us would. Shorter flows may have been more efficient, but they 
were less effective. It was like going on a date where someone asked us to get 
married even before they opened the car door for us.
■
■Key Point  A series of minor commitments and small reinforcements can produce behavioral 
outcomes that are not shown when we are asked all at once.
The point here is regardless of whether you are an intern or a C-suite execu-
tive at your venture, take screenshots of your conversion flows right now. 
Then study them. Don’t count how many steps there are for people to drop 
out. Count how many small commitments you ask and minor rewards you 
give, leading up to the moment of truth. If you don’t see two or three in that 
dance, add more screens rather than take any away. Then check with your 
optimizers to see if your business indicators get better.
Unfortunately, we must tell the darker rest of this story as a cautionary tale. 
Once we had completed Classmates’ conversion flow to the point of paying 
with a credit card for full privileges on the site, we were in a vulnerable state, 
willing to agree to things that we would normally refuse and failing to scruti-
nize information that we would normally resist. Escalating commitment had 
predisposed us to readily click any Submit button appearing late in these flows. 
(The same tendency leads retail stores to pack additional products near the 
lines to the cash registers for our so-called “impulse purchases”.)
With this temptation, Classmates joined with “outside marketing partners,” 
according to a statement issued after a multi-million dollar settlement in 
2015, “which offered enrollment in membership programs through ads dis-
played during or following certain online transactions”.v Although Classmates 
had already voluntarily ceased the practice and admitted no wrongdoing, the 
courts made them agree to stop misrepresenting the reason why they were 
requesting account information right after registration, and making it clear 
when they were transferring customers to a third-party site to buy something 
more.

Chapter 16 | Escalating Commitment
176
So if you’re a meme-maker, don’t be evil (as goes the oft-bent unofficial tag-
line of Google). And if you’re a user, don’t be fooled. Business people need 
to sell only what they say, and we need to buy only what we came for. In 
those moments where a series of minor gives-and-gets convinced us to open  
our minds and hearts to a meme-to dilate our protective bottlenecks as it 
were-we must quickly constrict them again when we have obtained what we 
came for. In practice this means carefully reading all “confirmation” screens 
and especially scrutinizing any further Submit buttons that appear.
In the next chapter, we examine that final step in a conversion flow even 
closer, and look at what it reveals about the psychology of giving and getting, 
offering and receiving, approaching and avoiding.

Approach 
Avoidance
The last chapter showed that conversion flows (the sequence of screens that 
we use to register, download, or pay for your digital invention) are not neces-
sarily more effective if they are shortened. A longer, slower escalation of the 
gives and gets often works better, even if it takes more clicks.
This is a difficult concept for computer scientists to come to accept: less effi-
ciency leading to greater effectiveness? In this case, yes. (The former Disney 
designer Jesse Schell has made a similar point about games: super efficient 
games are not fun. If you could just run right past the big boss monster and 
get the ultimate treasure, it would be the most boring game ever.)i Remember, 
maximizing your memetic fitness is about getting the peak synergy between 
the programming and the people using it, even if you feel it is imperfect 
programming.
In much the same way, a concept that is really difficult for digital product mar-
keters to accept is that addressing our concerns about adopting and paying for 
your digital meme may be more effective than refusing to acknowledge any reason 
for concern. Most of the copy that you write on conversion flows is dedicated 
to demonstrating the advantages of a meme. Little if any copy is ever written 
to dispel our concerns. And if someone in the legal department forces you to 
address some unpleasantness, you do it in the smallest font possible. But there 
may be a more effective way.

Examine for example this conversion flow on Allrecipes.com (Figure 17-1), 
which entices us to become paying members of the site. We’re paraphrasing, 
but here are the advantages we are gleaning from the copy as we move from 
screen to screen:
• 
Edit your recipes! And save them!
• 
Save time! Change recipes! Print better! Search by ingre-
dient! Look as you cook!
• 
Cheap! Cheaper! Cheapest!
• 
Easy!
And here are the subvocal concerns, some rational and some irrational, gnaw-
ing away at us as we move through these same screens:
• 
I want to be able to save and edit recipes, but I wonder 
how many emails I might get if I register?
• 
Would it really save me time? Printing is cool, but I’m 
always out of ink. Searching is cool, but will they be able 
to show only gluten-free recipes? Will the kitchen view 
of my recipes look as good on my iPad as they do on my 
laptop?
• 
The introductory price is a good deal, and oh yes, here I 
see what it will cost later; I guess that looks okay. I won-
der if this will auto-renew? If so, I’d better use a credit 
card not a debit card. I wonder if my spouse can use my 
account?
• 
Oh, here’s the page that needs my payment information. 
Could I get a refund if I need one? Do they have tele-
phone help? What happens if I click Submit twice or my 
internet gets interrupted right now?
Allrecipes has good answers for all of these questions, but the challenge they 
face is when and where is it best to display them?
■
■Key Point  The further we proceed down a conversion flow, the more we are in an avoidance 
mindset rather than an approach mindset.

Chapter 17 | Approach Avoidance
180
What’s at play here is the psychology of approach-avoidance, which has 
been thoroughly understood since the work of N.E. Miller in 1959.ii Imagine 
a continuum whereby we are mentally either very far away from paying for 
your meme, or considering it, up to the point where we are on the brink of 
submitting our credit card information. This is the distance from the goal (both 
our goal and yours), which was once just an abstract psychological concept, 
but now maps directly to how far in terms of screens we are from the conver-
sion screen.
Here’s the rub: when we are far away from a goal, we tend to be in an approach 
mindset, where we respond best to advantages. But the closer we get to the 
moment of truth where we adopt or acquire your meme, we are increasingly 
in an avoidance mindset, where we would respond best if you dispelled our 
concerns (Figure 17-2).

Figure 17-2.  Early conception of the approach-avoidance conflict. Adapted from Miller (1959).
Some in jest have called this the “wedding curve.” When someone asks our 
hand in marriage, we are initially focused entirely on his or her advantages 
(smile, job, and hot bod) and we can’t get enough of that. But during the 
engagement, as we plan the wedding, avoidance kicks in and we begin to get 
cold feet. Finally at the altar, avoidance is on par with approach, or even a little 
stronger, and we’re consumed as much by thoughts of the potential disadvan-
tages (their temper, debts, and our new in-laws sitting in the audience). It’s no 
wonder we are weeping as we say “I do” and the whole thing gets blessed, for 
better or for worse.

Bottlenecks
181
Just so, the copy in a conversion flow should describe the carrot in the early 
screens, but calm our fears about the stick in the later screens. And the argu-
ment here is that you will convert more people if you dispel our concerns 
than if you ignore them.
Miller even argued that avoidance can overtake approach at the moment of 
truth (although not universally). This would mean that you might actually be 
wasting our attention, and your screen real state, with each and every plug or 
pro you put on that last screen, and you should focus any and all messaging on 
eliminating perceived problems and cons.
More recently in 2007, psychologists Eric Knowles and Dan Riner reformu-
lated this into the omega strategy of persuasion, acknowledging that 
overcoming resistance is a strategy that is often overlooked.iii
One set of persuasion strategies attempts to increase 
the attractive features of the alternative; the second 
set attempts to decrease the negative features of the 
alternative. We have called the first one the alpha 
strategies because they seem always to be the first 
ones attempted.... We have called the second set the 
omega strategies because they attempt to reduce the 
resistance to selecting an alternative, because omega 
is the universal sign of resistance, and because they 
seem often to be the last strategies considered.
We explore this deeper in the next chapter, but their essential point was that 
you’ll do better to overcome resistance than to ignore it. And the right time 
to do this is at the very end of the conversion flow. That’s the theory, and your 
own conversion-rate optimizers have every ability to test it. All they have to 
do is show or hide resistance-overcoming statements at different places in the 
flow in an treatment-control experimental design. Don’t take our word for it; 
find out among your own users.
■
■Key Point  Copy that dispels our concerns can result in more conversions than not 
acknowledging any reason for concern.
That’s what the makers of Windows 10 faced in 2015 in what was one of the 
biggest conversion bets in the history of tech. Prior to that point, Windows 
was sold as a licensed product, where we were paying for it to be installed 
in the PCs we purchased. But right at the launch of Windows 10, Microsoft 
took a risk to simply give Windows away for the first year to those of us who 
would upgrade our Windows 7 or 8 devices. They were gambling that when 
we installed Windows 10, we would use Bing more, read MSN more, buy more 
things in the Microsoft Store, and even subscribe more often to Office 365, all 
of which should make up for the lost revenue from Windows licenses.

Chapter 17 | Approach Avoidance
182
Figure 17-3. A notification encouraging users to upgrade to Windows 10.
So for that year, on our desktops we saw an invitation to upgrade to Windows 
10 for free (Figure 17-3), which was in every way the start of a conversion 
flow.
But imagine what we were thinking along that continuum from considering 
a Windows 10 upgrade to actually starting the upgrade process. Those of 
us who were considering upgrading some weeks or months out from the 
present would be more in an approach mindset, and so would we would pre-
sumably resonate more to information about the advantages of Windows 10. 
Thus we would be receptive to any positive information about Cortana, the 
personal assistant, Microsoft Edge, the new browser that let us scribble on 
web sites and share them, and Windows Hello, the facial-recognition feature 
that would finally relieve us of remembering passwords. We wanted to hear 
how Windows 10 was easier to use than Windows 8, and about how we were 
getting back the familiar Start menu from Windows 7. We wanted to learn it 
was free.
But among us who planned to upgrade sooner, this week or even today, the 
avoidance mindset would have become much stronger. We would need infor-
mation that would counter any possible disadvantages. Closer to actually acting, 
we were receptive to information reaffirming that Windows 10 would work 
on our devices, that the upgrade would be quick, and that the usability would 
be at least as good as Windows 7.

Bottlenecks
183
Realizing this, Microsoft made a small but psychologically crucial change to 
the desktop invitations: they put a note on them that said “This PC is compat-
ible” (Figure 17-4). This is precisely the type of omega-strategy information 
we needed to acknowledge and dispel our concerns at the moment of truth. 
It told us that the new OS would work our our machines. And elsewhere, in 
the emails Microsoft sent to Outlook.com users, they added a link that said 
“Answer Desk is here to help with Windows 10. Chat with us or schedule an 
appointment.” Rather than ignore our concerns, they addressed them.
Figure 17-4.  Later notifications dispelled concerns about upgrading to Windows 10 by 
saying “This PC is compatible.”
By the end of the first year, 350 million of us had upgraded to Windows 
10, making it the fastest-adopted operating system version in Microsoft’s 
history.iv If nothing else, we can say we all arrived at a state where we had 
more “approach” than “avoidance,” and as Microsoft learned, it is strategic to 
tackle both.

Routes to 
Persuasion
In the last chapter, you saw that as we get closer to actually downloading your 
app or joining your site, you should dispel our concerns about granting you our 
attention as much or more than you demonstrate the benefits of your content. 
In the moment of truth, stop plugging your work and start plugging its holes. 
This will win you more active users than if you pretend the holes don’t exist.
Writing some persuasive text is only one of the many ways to do that, and 
it is the most direct, full-frontal, and rational approach. But in Chapter 4 on 
Gestalt psychology, you saw that text is not the only, nor always the most 
effective, tool at your disposal in a digital world. Indeed, there are just as many 
ways you can dispel our concerns by preventing us from thinking about them at all. 
This chapter is about that idea and when to use it.
You’re not the first meme-maker to think about persuading us to take the 
action that meets your business objectives. That goes back at least as early as 
the propaganda experts in World Wars I and II. In the United States, the guru 
of propaganda was Carl Iver Hovland, a psychologist and, in the context of 
his time, a patriot who was serving his country by getting people to purchase 
the federal bonds that financed the war. Propaganda predates even Hovland, 
of course, but he may have been the first to really watch how we react to it. 
As early as 1949, he noticed we were anything but passive.i He saw that when 
people are exposed to persuasive messages, they often “rehearse their own 
position and seek new ways of supporting it.” After a decade or so of research 
on that idea, Festinger and Maccoby (1964)ii concluded that Hovland was right:
18

Chapter 18 | Routes to Persuasion
186
Certainly such a listener is not passive…he is very 
actively, inside his own mind, counterarguing, dero-
gating the points the communicator makes, and dero-
gating the communicator himself. In other words, we 
can imagine that there is really a dialogue going on, 
one side being vocal and the other subvocal… [I]f 
one could somehow prevent the listener from arguing 
back…it seems reasonable to expect that the per-
suasive message would then have more of an impact. 
(Emphasis added.)
Prevent the listener from arguing back. That is entirely different than counter-
arguing the counterarguments. This new idea was one of the more powerful 
insights into persuasion of the 20th century, sparking volumes of research 
that coalesced into a model by Richard Petty and John Cacioppo in 1986 that 
described the central and peripheral routes to persuasion.iii Here, we 
summarize it in a way that you as a digital meme-maker can use:
• 
If your value-proposition is strong, that is, unique, meets 
a clear need, and is differentiated from competitors, then 
use central routes to persuasion that increase our 
attentional capacity to process your rational, argument-
based message.
• 
If your value-proposition is weak, that is, similar to alterna-
tives, not a necessity, and is only an incremental improve-
ment over competitors, then use peripheral routes 
to persuasion and decrease our attentional capacity 
for counterarguing against your emotional image-based or 
lifestyle-based message.
Petty and Cacioppo’s model was powerful because it integrated cognitive psy-
chology (attention), motivational psychology (addressing both approach and 
avoidance) and as you’ll see soon, social psychology (leveraging conformity 
and celebrities). Whereas in Chapter 7, our working-memory bottleneck was 
cast as a harsh reality challenging every meme-maker, Petty and Cacioppo 
showed you how to use displacement to your advantage. They argued you 
should clear working memory to allow for the arguments you want to get 
through, and clutter working memory with stimulation that will displace the 
resistance you want to squeeze out.
Finally, this model also acknowledged that not all business ventures are alike. 
Some of you are selling things we really need, and some of you are selling sug-
ary water and deep-fried flour. As meme-makers, some of you are trying to get 
us to join WebMD and the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication 
and the Ice-Bucket Challenge to fight ALS, while others are trying to get us 
to make in-app purchases of “badges” and other secondary-reinforcers, read

vapid internet lists (“Top 10 moustache guys without their moustaches!”), and 
pay for porn. As the great singer Leonard Cohen said, everyone is a hustler. 
For better or for worse, Petty and Cacioppo’s model gives you all the tools 
to do that.
So what are some specific tactics of the central and peripheral routes to 
persuasion? You determine whether your value proposition is strong or weak, 
then you use the corresponding themes to develop messaging for your adver-
tising campaigns.
Central-route arguments to increase approach/or 
reduce avoidance:
• 
There are many pros/few cons
• 
There is a lot of value/little cost
• 
This increases gains/minimizes risks
• 
This saves time/takes no time
• 
This saves attention (simple, convenient)/makes no 
attentional demands (spam, notifications)
• 
This fulfills needs/ensures your needs don’t go 
unfulfilled
Peripheral-route arguments to increase approach:
• 
This will make you attractive (source effects)
• 
People just like you like this (similar comparison 
others)
• 
Experts recommend this (they thought about it so 
you don’t have to)
• 
Everyone is doing this (conformity)
• 
This earns you status
• 
This feels good
• 
You deserve this
• 
This may not be valuable, but it could lead to 
valuable things (secondary reinforcers)
Peripheral-route arguments to decrease avoidance:
• 
Don’t listen to yourself think (bright color, loud 
noise, distracting pictures, scarcity of time to decide)
• 
This chance won’t last (scarcity)

Chapter 18 | Routes to Persuasion

• 
Disruption of counterarguing with mildly confusing 
messaging (Knowles & Linn, 2004)
• 
You already showed some commitment; don’t 
change course (norm of consistency, Cialdini, 2007)
• 
We already gave you something; it’s only right to 
give back (norm of reciprocity, Cialdini, 2007)
You’ll notice that the omega strategy of persuasion that we introduced last 
chapter appears here as a perigraphal route to reduce avoidance. Among the 
more interesting omega strategies is one in which you disrupt counterargu-
ing with a purposefully confusing message. Knowles & Linn showed in one of 
their 2004 studies that people were more likely to drive the speed limit when 
the sign was posted as 24.5 miles per hour than 25 miles per hour.iv Why? 
Because 24.5 mph was a confusing message that disrupted people’s likelihood 
to resist it. The social-buying venture Groupon was famous in its early days 
for its quirky and confusing newsletters, which often triggered action. Later, 
the collaboration platform #Slack was among the fastest-growing apps on the 
web—and while it was installing, the screen showed the confusing message 
“You look nice today” in another example of how being unexpected can dis-
tract us from our own internal resistance and avoidance.
Another peripheral route to persuasion involves the norm in our society that 
shames us into staying consistent and avoiding changing our minds or “flip 
flopping.” Psychologist Robert Cialdiniv showed that you can use this to your 
advantage by getting us to agree to a small request, and then implying that we 
shouldn’t stop or change course now. An example of this appears when you 
join a music-streaming service (like Pandora or Groove Music), or a cloud-
storage service (like OneDrive or Dropbox) and you see a message telling 
you to populate the playlists or folders with data (e.g., “It’s lonely in here.” 
“You haven’t added any music yet.”)
Similarly, another norm in our society is the golden rule: if someone gives us 
something we should give something back. Cialdini showed that this is another 
peripheral route by which you can get us to act without thinking, and it works 
especially well in the digital world where you can give us very cheap gifts. Tell 
us you just gave us a few gigs of storage space, a few free minutes of talk time, 
a few free reads of an online article, or a few free texts. After that, send us 
a message that implies we should join your service, implying we should give 
something back. It works more often than you think, and more often than we 
would like to admit.
But at the heart of Petty and Cacioppo’s peripheral routes to prevent coun-
terargument is simply to crank up the music, sound, or dramatic visualizations 
when your arguments are weak, and just as purposefully turn them all off 
when your arguments are strong. Online video, just like television commer-
cials before them, succeeds or fails by this principle. To really get a sense for it,

we rounded up some of the videos produced or sponsored by the candidates 
in the U.S. presidential election of 2016.

Don’t worry, both ends of the political spectrum use the same tactic. Here are 
two videos from Hillary Clinton’s supporters:
One using central routes to dilate working-memory 
capacity: https://youtu.be/41Eg7kZrKz4
One using peripheral routes to displace counterar-
guing: https://youtu.be/0uY7gLZDmn4
We’ll end this chapter with the reverse point for users: when you notice that 
a company is using loud, distracting peripheral routes to persuasion, it might 
signal that their product is not entirely worth the cost. Any time you’re in a 
teen-apparel store with loud music, disconcertingly cold air-conditioning, and 
wall-sized posters of attractive models wearing perplexingly little clothing at 
all, ask yourself whether it might be intended to distract your internal coun-
terargument against paying those prices for logoed T-shirts. A similar argu-
ment can be made for politicians.

Social Capital
Your meme has now firmly established itself in a human mind. It was noticed, 
understood, remembered, and recalled. It aligned well enough with our dispo-
sitions and life-stages that it actually helped to meet an existential need. We 
engaged with your innovation not once, but multiple times, even logging many 
hours with it, and you managed somehow to overcome our inhibitions, or 
distract us from them, well enough to earn our subscription fees or monetize 
our attention.
But one customer won’t keep your lights on or your investors happy. No, to 
expand your user base, there are still two unforgiving bottlenecks that your dig-
ital venture must survive, and both of them are social in nature: we will need to  
recommend your meme to others who themselves must be receptive to adopting 
it. Psychology has something to teach you about these last two trials as well.
■
■Key Point  We must recommend your meme to others for it to spread virally. But if we have no 
direct stake in your success, why would we do that?
What would possess us to recommend your meme to someone else? We 
didn’t invent it and we have no financial stake in its success. And we’re not 
overly inclined to charity, especially to tech giants and Silicon Valley. So why 
do we do it?
Proof is everywhere that recommendations are critical to business. Many apps 
on our smartphones send a notification after a few days of use, asking us if 
we would recommend it in the app store. More and more web sites, applica-
tions, and now even Windows 10 display a pop-up dialog box asking us if we 
19

are likely to recommend the experience. Many sellers on Amazon encourage 
us to recommend our purchases. And finally, the customer-satisfaction sur-
veys fielded by world’s biggest enterprises have been using the Net Promoter 
Score (NPS), a trademarked question and scoring method that begins with, 
“How likely is it that you would recommend _____ to a friend or colleague?”
As you commit to aligning your digital designs with our psychology, you will 
want to know if your efforts are paying off, and sooner or later you will be 
fielding an NPS-like question in your own surveys. This has become the main 
customer-service metric around the world. If you follow the trademarked 
method, you will ask us to give a rating to this question on a scale from (0) 
“Not at all likely”, through (5) “Neutral”, up to (10) “Extremely likely”.
The founders of the NPS refer to those of us who choose 9 or 10 as pro-
moters. We are the most likely to recommend your meme. Those who 
choose 0 through 6 are detractors. We won’t recommend it, and we are 
likely to speak negatively of it. And those who choose 7 and 8 are passives, 
that is, we are just giving a polite answer but harbor no strong feeling.
To calculate the NPS score (Figure 19-1), you subtract the percent of promot-
ers from the percent of detractors, yielding the “net” percent of promoters, 
as described in the name. The score can range from -100% to +100%. So for 
example, in 2003, AOL had 32% promoters and 42% detractors, for a net of 
-10%. Around the same time, MSN had 41% promoters and 32% detractors, 
for a net of +9%.i
The NPS question is itself a meme, and a successful one, so it is interesting 
to explore its origins, especially to understand how recommendations came to 
such prominence. To do that, we go back to 2003 when a Harvard-trained 
market researcher by the name of Frederick Reichheld, one of the trademark-
holders for the NPS, was searching for a better way to measure customer 
satisfaction. He was part of a mini-movement of scholars, including James 
Heskett, also from Harvard, and Ross Goodwin from Hewlett-Packard, who 
were seeking predictors of profitability other than mere customer happiness. 
Although everyone wanted satisfied customers, executives craved something 
a little closer in the causal chain to cold hard cash.

In Reichheld’s search, he became a Bain Fellow and began working closely 
with a firm in Silicon Valley called CustomerSat, later known as Satmetrix 
Systems. There he met the leaders of Satmetrix, André Schwager and 
Rosalie Buonauro, who had recently learned from staff analysts Doug Doyle 
and Henry Evans that a survey question was partially predicting key business-
performance metrics that publicly-traded enterprises were reporting to the 
SEC. What question was it? It was our likelihood to recommend it to a friend 
or colleague.iii With this insight, Schwager and Buonauro went on to help 
Reichheld publish an article titled “The One Number You Need to Grow.”iv In 
2006, Reichheld published a book titled The Ultimate Question.v
As Reichheld put it, “It turned out that a single survey question can, in fact, 
serve as a useful predictor of growth. But that question isn’t about customer 
satisfaction or even loyalty—at least in so many words. Rather, it’s about cus-
tomers’ willingness to recommend a product or service to someone else.”vi
What is the magic in such a question that led to its use across the globe? The 
answer is it’s social. It means that one of us who uses your meme has become 
so convinced of its value that we have decided to join you in spreading it to 
our most important and intimate connections. A recommendation is the 
next money event for your online venture; it is required for your meme to go 
viral. But why would we do such a thing?
Our motivation is the same as yours; it’s what unites inventors and users. 
We share the same fundamental objective in the age of information: we’re 
both trying to spread the meme of our personal identity. We all want others to 
know our name. And when we, as users, stumble on to the killer app that you 
made, or your mind-blowing video, or your new TV series, or even something 
as humble as a really elegant piece of open-source code that you wrote, we 
anchor our identity to your invention and recommend it to others, thereby increasing 
the memetic fitness of both. The reward for you is an invention that goes viral 
and a spike in stock prices. The reward for us is the growth in our social 
capital: the social credibility we gain among social relations that increases 
our access to network resources and expected returns.vii
Thus, many of us in the new millennium recommended playlists through 
iTunes, shared TED talks through Facebook, and described what we were 
binge-watching on Netflix as we conversed with friends, both online or face-
to-face. Each time a friend to whom we recommended something returned 
to us, days or maybe months later, and thanked us for turning them on to a 
particle of culture in the global soup of memetic content, we drew satisfaction 
from the fact that they encoded our identity together with our recommenda-
tion indelibly in memory. We were influential. This was both a reward in itself 
and a favor we could call upon in the future.

Chapter 19 | Social Capital
196
This is why in the summer of 2015, Slack became one of the fastest spreading 
productivity apps to date.viii Middle-managers all across Silicon Valley recom-
mended that their teams start using Slack, a group-messaging and file-shar-
ing collaboration platform. As a result, over 150M of us were using Slack 
monthly, and its valuation exploded to over $2B less than two years after it 
was invented.
Those middle-managers wanted to do what social psychologist Robert 
Cialdini in 1976 termed basking in reflected glory. They wanted to bask 
in the reflected glory of Slack, to be known as the person who introduced this 
culture-changing tool to their companies, and to spread their own meme as 
they spread the Slack meme. As Cialdini put it, “[P]eople make known their 
non-instrumental connections with positive sources because they understand 
that observers to these connections tend to evaluate connected objects simi-
larly… Being merely associated with someone else’s success and failure [has] 
much the same effect as personal success and failure.”ix
We not only gain the esteem of others when we recommend great things we 
have purchased, our self-esteem rises. America’s founding father of psychol-
ogy, William James, was the first to observe this in 1890:
[A] man’s Self is the sum total of all that he can call his, not only his 
body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife 
and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his 
lands and horses, and yacht and bank-account. All these things give 
him the same emotions. If they wax and prosper, he feels triumphant; 
if they dwindle and die away, he feels cast down.
So you should fully expect to feel great when you see promoters recommend 
your meme, and terrible when detractors revile it. For this reason, you should 
begin tracking your recommendations and execute deliberate plans to make 
them increase.
One of the things that the NPS got right was to stop throwing out the data 
from detractors. Prior to its appearance, many research studies in the busi-
ness sector reported only the percent who were satisfied or very satisfied 
(the so-called Top-2 Box score, meaning the percent of people who chose the 
top two scale items in a satisfaction or recommendation rating). This effec-
tively jettisoned the rest of us from further analysis, including those among 
us who were the most angry. (A simple arithmetic average does not have this 
problem—it reflects each and every response in the sample.)
Ignoring detractors was a mistake, because those among us who warn oth-
ers against adopting a meme also stand to increase our social capital by helping 

Bottlenecks
197
prevent others from having the poor experiences that we endured. How often have 
you read negative reviews that implied somewhere that their reason for writ-
ing was to “make sure no one else experienced the same thing”?
This explains the outrage in social media that erupted in 2015 when it was 
revealed that Volkswagen had engineered millions of diesel engines around the 
world to cheat on emissions tests. It wasn’t enough to decouple our identi-
ties from the brand (by scraping off the Fahrvergnügen bumper stickers and 
throwing out our T-shirts). Instead we took to Twitter and Facebook to troll, 
flame, and hate on the company.
■
■Key Point  Both recommending memes and warning others against them raises our social 
capital. Our actual behavior is as important to measure as our stated likelihood to do so.
At this point, there has been more than a decade of research on the NPS, 
and as you can imagine, Reichheld’s early enthusiasm about it being the “one 
number” and the “ultimate question” has been tempered by empirical truth. 
All good memes eventually try to spread into inhospitable ecosystems, in 
this case, misuses of their original insights. Scholars now argue that it makes 
no sense to ask if we would recommend an entire company like Microsoft 
or Google, which has dozens of products. As Doug Doyle says, “When you 
ask me if I would recommend something, you have to be clear—recommend 
what?” Also, the NPS scoring method has never out-performed traditional 
averages in predictive power. Finally, when predicting overall company growth, 
good old customer satisfaction has never been shown to be a bad predictor 
itself; quite often it’s just as good as likelihood to recommend.x
But if you’re trying to predict whether we would ever purchase something 
again, or renew a subscription, or get referrals that could make your business 
go viral—recommendations are still a key metric. Also, regardless what your 
absolute NPS number is, or whether it predicts next quarter’s profits, if it 
spikes or dips quickly, your senior leadership should know about it.
Just as they should know about actual recommendations. Many analysts like 
Doyle are moving away from NPS, and instead measuring actual, active recom-
mendations. They use a question to the effect of, “Have you recommended 
______ to a friend or colleague in the past month?” It can be answered 
with a simple yes or no, thus making the beloved percentage the best sum-
mary statistic for it, and simple enough to take to C-level leadership. Doyle 
implemented this at Microsoft. In this way, his surveys didn’t ask our intention 
to recommend (which mainly reflects our underlying satisfaction), but instead 
our behavior of recommending.

In the next chapter, we examine closer how promoters and detractors actu-
ally behave on social media, and how we are sometimes even more extreme 
than we would have been alone, without group interaction.

Group 
Polarization
The uninhibited expression of negativity and antisocial sentiment began early 
on the internet and is getting worse.
As early as 1984, psychologist Sara Kiesler of Carnegie Mellon University and 
her colleagues recognized that computer-mediated communication lacked cues 
to regulate normal interaction.i By 1990, Spears, Lea, and Lee had shown the 
extremitization of opinions in computer-mediated discourse.ii These studies,  
however, were done with locally networked computers, not those separated 
by half a planet, as eventually became commonplace.
By 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that over 70% of us had wit-
nessed online harassment and 40% had been the target of it.iii This ranged 
from name calling and efforts to purposefully embarrass someone all the way 
to sustained sexual harassment and stalking. Men tended to be called offensive 
names and threatened, whereas women tended to be sexually harassed and 
stalked. Two-thirds experienced this on social media and one-fifth in com-
ments sections of other sites. A quarter found it very or extremely upsetting.
When these attacks are targeted at those of you trying to create and market your 
ideas and inventions, the damage goes from personal to professional. Indeed, in our 
role as unofficial spokespeople for users everywhere, we acknowledge that 
for every instance where we promote your meme, there can be a hundred 
instances where we detract from it, often with irrational arguments, irrel-
evant personal attacks, and inexplicable passion.

■Key Point  Detractors’ negative online comments and reduced star ratings directly predict a 
loss in revenue or conversion rates.
Journalism has been all but redefined by the ugly reader comments that have 
marred so many carefully-written pieces. In their helplessness to prevent it, 
writers have taken to increasingly unusual forms of counter-measures. Alanah 
Pearce, a journalist covering the gaming industry, began tattling on the moth-
ers of Facebook trolls (who generally turned out to be young boys) when-
ever their comments got especially threatening. “OMG little shit,” one mother 
wrote back, “I’M SO SORRY YES I WILL TALK TO HIM!!!”iv Rex Huppke of the 
Chicago Tribune sent his trolls a holiday letter in 2015, ending with “I wish you 
well, Internet Trolls… I’m not going anywhere. And something tells me you 
aren’t, either.”v And Katie Notopoulos of BuzzFeed in her guide to dealing with 
trolls (“here’s your hazmat suit for the toxic garbage dump known as the ‘net’”) 
echoed an idea that many agree on: arguing with trolls online never ends the 
problem, only exacerbates it. “You’d never really get that Perfect Own anyway.”vi
Musicians were also impacted. Emily Haines and James Shaw of the Canadian 
band, Metric expressed the view in 2015 that online fan comments had made 
them less politically provocative and gender-empowered—two mainstays of 
rock and punk music.vii Emily said…
“I feel a little bit burned, because we were pretty early 
adopters and really excited about the idea of how 
[the internet] could democratize things for musicians, 
but…it’s actually a total nightmare…I used to be way 
more outspoken about things, and it’s just not worth 
it to me to bring hellfire upon my family and friends, 
just to court controversy!”
James agreed with a poetic twist, “Why would you ever say anything? So the 
democratization of the internet has actually created an extremely safe place 
where nobody can say anything.”
Or look at restaurant owners and those dedicated to the culinary arts. This 
has always been a high-risk industry, with many new eateries closing their 
doors within a year or so. This is only made worse when unchecked negative 
comments drive down star ratings, and in turn, traffic and sales. Investigating 
that in 2011, econometrician Michael Luca compared the Yelp star ratings of 
3,500 restaurants in Seattle to their revenue as reported to the Washington 
State DOR.viii Luca used a sophisticated form of regression analysis that looked 
for instances where a discontinuous drop in revenue occurred immediately 
after a discontinuous drop in star ratings. This was to help affirm that the star 
ratings had a causal influence on sales. He found that on average, a drop of 1 
star-rating out of 5 resulted in a 9% drop in revenue.

Bottlenecks
201
It was even worse for mobile apps. In 2013, apps in the Apple Store with star 
ratings between 4.5 and 5 enjoyed about 264,000 U.S. downloads, accord-
ing to Oliver Yeh of the big data firm SensorTower.ix But when we as users 
attacked them with our comments and brought down the star ratings to 
between 3.5 and 4, apps saw only 80,000 U.S. downloads on average. That’s 
a 70% drop with only a one point decrease. For many apps this was enough 
to trigger memetic extinction. Similar results were found in 2015 by market 
research firm Apptentive, whose consumer survey revealed the predictions 
shown in Figure 20-1.
Detracting from people, companies, and innovations online has become all 
but a national pastime. In the 90s, this was known as flaming. In the 00s, it was 
cyber-bullying. Today, it’s trolling. But in the terminology of social psychology 
dating back to 60s, it is known as group polarization.
If you understand polarization, we believe that you can curb it. Despite how 
it might appear, haters are not, in fact, taking over the web. Don’t forget, the 
same web has produced truth (Wikipedia), trust (Uber, Airbnb), and altruism  
(the ALS ice-bucket challenge). In the same 2014 Pew study mentioned

previously, a majority of us also agreed that online environments can be more 
supportive of others than offline environments, even as a majority of us felt 
they are more critical. This presents no contradiction for the theory of group 
polarization, which holds that group discussion can extremitize options toward 
both the positive and negative poles.
No, we believe that the expression of hate is largely the result of interface design 
flaws. If it is worse online than in real life, you have a chance to bring it under 
control by changing the UX design, and we believe you must. Not just for the 
survival of your meme through this bottleneck of social hyperbole (a gauntlet 
really), but because none of us can give up yet on the dream of a productive, 
democratic, global conversation that the web once promised.
■
■Key Point  Group polarization, the tendency for opinions to get more extreme in online 
discussion, may be an easily-triggered psychological tendency. But it can be curbed by better 
interaction design.
Let’s understand group polarization as it was described by Moscovici and 
Zavalloni in 1969.xi In the typical research paradigm, there are three steps: 
first, individuals must express attitudes about an issue in isolation; second, 
we must discuss the issue in a group; third, we must express our attitudes a 
second time.
What happens is that our attitudes measured after the discussion are more 
extreme or polarized than they were before the discussion (Figure 20-2). This 
outcome is so consistent and predictable, that University of Chicago profes-
sor Cass Sunstein declared it a law in 1999.xii It has “demonstrative reliability,” 
meaning that it is so reliable you can demonstrate it live, as many psychology 
professors have done for decades in classrooms and lecture halls.

But the “group” in group polarization refers to the discussion (not societal 
groups), and “polarization” refers to the attitudes shifting toward the extreme 
(not the group splitting in two). We unpack this term carefully because we 
know that in today’s context, “group polarization” often invokes an image of 
two groups (like the left and right in American politics) isolating themselves 
and their increasingly radical points of view. This is happening to be sure (as 
demonstrated on Twitter by Sarita Yardi and Danah Boyd in 2010),xiii and the 
existence of culturally-recognized groups makes polarization worse. But such 
formal groups aren’t required for extreme opinions to be expressed. It only 
takes a collection of us using any given comment section, brought together for 
no other reason than to review your meme.
Unfortunately, there are but a few simple social-situational ingredients that, 
when combined, put us on the path of expressing ourselves in a more hyper-
bolic, extreme, and unsocial way. We only need an issue that is not perfectly 
balanced between pro and con (and few issues are). And we need a group 
discussion. In almost every case, our opinions will drift toward the crazy. This 
should concern you, because whether you’re a journalist who has published a 
blog, an entrepreneur who has launched an app, a musician who has uploaded 
a song, or a chef who has opened a restaurant, any slight leaning of your meme 
toward good or bad will almost certainly be amplified by an online discussion.
And the worst part is, there are not just a few trolls out there for you to 
avoid, but instead, any one of us can be turned into a troll simply by joining the 
conversation.

Chapter 20 | Group Polarization
204
Decades of research on polarization have confirmed which situational risk 
factors make it worse. We know that our online comments are more likely to 
become extremitized when…
We lack immediacy—we are physically or psychologi-
cally distanced from one another
We are predisposed—we are already leaning for or 
against an issue
We discuss a topic at length—the longer an online con-
versation goes on, the more polarized it gets
Societal groups are salient—our belongingness to 
an ingroup and differences from an outgroup are 
emphasized
Arguments are imbalanced—we only hear one-sided 
arguments not two-sided arguments
Competition is encouraged—we are encouraged to be 
extreme or prototypical of our group
We are deindividuated—we are difficult to personally 
identify
As you can see reading that list, the conditions for polarization could not be 
more ripe in online environments. First of all, the low immediacy, or lack of 
psychological nearness between your trolls and you, is assumed in any com-
puter-mediated conversation. Psychologists in the low-tech 60s often exac-
erbated polarization with little more than a partition between commenters, 
or moving from voice-to-voice conversation to paper-based. These small 
decreases in immediacy were nowhere close to the globe-spanning distance 
we now see between any two people commenting on a given Amazon product. 
The lack of immediacy online is probably the risk factor for polarization that 
you can do the least about. So you need to understand and concentrate on 
the others.
In regard to predisposition, the success of search engines like Google have also 
allowed us to self-select to topics and slants that match our own views. For 
example, searching on Donald Trump in 2015 produced a list of headlines we 
could choose to read on the basis of whether or not they seemed to support 
the presidential candidate. By that point in history, most Americans also knew 
the slant of news outlets like CNN and Fox News (not to mention NPR and 
much of AM radio) and were accustomed choosing the channel they found 
most comfortable and the best match to their predisposed opinions. Two 
studies of Twitter have demonstrated this kind of self-segregation: we tend to 
retweet (Conover and colleagues, 2011) and reply to (Yardi and Boyd, 2010) 
only those tweets that match our party affiliation and views on extreme politi-
cal positions.xiv

Bottlenecks
205
But it turns out, merely knowing the leaning of the crowd is enough to pro-
vide us with all the slant we need for polarization. Salganik, Dodds, and Watts 
created a music-sharing site to demonstrate this in 2006.xv When users were 
allowed to see the download count of the songs (versus having this kept hid-
den), their ratings became polarized, that is, the difference between good and 
bad songs became all the greater. This study suggested that extremitization is 
a network effect, meaning that it arises simply as a result of many-to-many 
information sharing. We only need to see the distribution of star ratings, and 
we’ll amplify it.
Early in a series of online comments, you rarely see polarized opinions. Instead, 
they tend to appear later in the conversation. Extreme expressions tend to 
ramp up as the conversation goes on. Experiments in the 60s and 70s often 
required participants to discuss an issue until they all came to consensus. This 
ensured some degree of polarization. Just like the 2013 town hall meetings 
about Obamacare, the longer it goes on, the uglier we get.
Formal societal groups are not required for polarization, but nonetheless, when 
any well-known “us and them” enters the conversation, the trolls really come 
out.xvi This can be anything from football teams to religious groups to political 
parties to race. And no side is free of blame. You can just as easily find polar-
ized comments on Fox News as on MSN. Interestingly, even when one side 
accuses the other of unnecessary trolling and asks them to calm down, they 
still often attribute the bad behavior to membership in a group like “vanilla 
hate people,” and “vitriolic rubes in landlockedville.” Any references to group 
identity in this way are like throwing gasoline on the fire of polarization.
When you take time to actually read online comments, you’ll notice they are 
often imbalanced in the sense of being one-sided rather than two-sided.xvii 
When we want to make a serious effort to convince people of something, we 
will anticipate opposition and raise counterarguments ourselves so we can 
refute them rationally or find common ground. These are two-sided argu-
ments. But online this occurs far too seldom, and the preponderance of one-
sided arguments has the effect of pushing everyone’s discourse to become 
more and more extreme.
The next point in our list about competition being encouraged occurs when com-
menters see some advantage or status to being more extreme. One such clue 
is when the online comments that are replied to most are sorted to the top 
or in some other way prominently displayed. This poor design decision that 
makes the troll’s choice easy: say something preposterous, stupid, or racist, and 
it will be like catnip to all the reasonable people out there who reply with their 
rejoinders, elevating the original snarky statement from obscurity to fame. 
This reveals something about the fundamental motivation of trolls: they believe 
the fitness of their memes (yes, nasty comments are memes too) is increased 
the more radical they are in the sense of surviving the attentional bottleneck 

Chapter 20 | Group Polarization
206
(although they rarely pass the bottleneck of recommendation). This is what 
BuzzFeed reporter Katie Notopoulos was referring to when she wrote.xviii
“One of the key elements of true trolling that we 
often forget is that trolls don’t actually mean it; they’re 
just trying to stir shit. When a troll hops in and says, 
“Actually, Hitler was cool,” they don’t believe Hitler 
was cool—they’re just trying to get you mad. Because, 
as you very well know, Hitler is not actually cool. But 
the moment you fall for it and scream back, “Actually, 
Hitler is WAY not cool!” you have already lost.”
The last item on our list that promotes polarization, deindividuation, liter-
ally means that, in the situation, we cannot easily be identified individually. 
The most direct way to produce this is anonymity, literally, the absence of 
real names. One of Facebook’s most valuable early decisions in the evolution 
of its empire was to require real names. This was not the norm in the early 
chat rooms from AOL through Myspace. But it created incredible equity for 
Facebook as evidenced by the 2012 drop in its stock price when it published 
a report to the SEC suggesting that 83 million names might not be authentic 
(duplicates, pets, spammers).xix Nonetheless, with this decision, press outlets 
in 2008 began requiring commenters to associate their remarks with their 
Facebook accounts and hence real names. This was a huge business win for 
Facebook because it let it grab a large chunk of the attention and traffic that 
was hard-won by other publishers. And it was a significant turning point in the 
history of democratic discourse on the web. Witness how The New York Times 
struggled with this decision in this 2012 blog post:
“We encourage commenters to use their real names, 
but also see an advantage to allowing for anonymity. 
While we notice that those who comment under real 
names (or what appear to be real names) tend to 
leave more coherent and well-written comments that 
are civil in tone, we have heard from a number of rea-
ders that they value the ability to comment under a 
handle or pseudonym. For example, someone making 
a comment in an article about the business practices 
of her employer may not want to be publicly identified, 
lest she suffer retribution. A commenter undergoing 
treatment for a medical condition he would rather 
not discuss with family and friends has good reason to 
keep his observations private, even if he has valuable 
experiences to share on a story about his illness.”xx

207
Clearly, NYT editors were familiar with the way that deindividuation pro-
duced polarized opinions. But sometimes “polarized” opinions included some-
thing valuable rather than vitriolic, something closer to civil disobedience than 
incivility. The NYT initially required Facebook logins for comments, but later 
made it one option to verify identities under a “trusted comments” system.xxi 
The lesson we can learn from this is to remove anonymity only if you don’t get 
the improvement you want by focusing on the other changes.
What specific steps can you take to curb polarization and improve the overall 
quality of public discourse with your meme? Here are some ideas.
If you know that our online comments are more likely to become extremitized 
when…
We lack immediacy—then publish the city and state 
where the commenter is from (e.g., Coralville, Iowa) 
using either Facebook data or cellular location aware-
ness; use this especially if your impact is regional, like a 
news outlet or a service like Yelp or Uber.
We are predisposed—then stop advertising exclusively 
with search engines where people can self-select to 
certain topics and slants; use display advertising stra-
tegically to pull in a more diverse set of opinions; 
encourage hash tags that refer to a topic in general 
to collect diverse opinions (#useofforce rather than a 
specific leaning #zealouscops) that will attract predis-
posed people.
We discuss a topic at length—then disallow new posts 
after a certain length of time, number of comments, or 
level of quality. The NYT closes comments 24 hours 
after an article is published or “when we feel the dis-
cussion has run its course and there is nothing substantial 
to gain from having more comments on the article.”
Groups are salient—then remove mentions of nation-
ality, political party, gender, and race from both the 
dialogue and your own branding and marketing before 
they spark polarization; it might be cute to cheer on 
a football team when you’re just getting started, but 
cease doing so when you expand.
Arguments are imbalanced—then showcase comments 
with both the highest and lowest star ratings; have a 
moderator raise counterarguments and refute them.

Chapter 20 | Group Polarization
208
Competition is encouraged—then encourage reason-
ableness instead: stop sorting by whether comments 
are liked and start sorting by usefulness ratings; don’t 
elevate comments with the most replies; showcase 
comments chosen by the author or editor.
We are deindividuated—then force commenters to 
post using their Facebook identity only as a last resort 
after you’ve taken other steps to increase immediacy 
or reward reasonableness; if your meme is more sen-
sitive and targeted to special populations (as with a 
medical condition or a stigmatized social group), allow 
more deindividuation, but if your meme is targeted to 
the general population, allow less.
What about the question of whether you should reply to trolls, or even to 
reasonable criticisms made by your customers or users. Should you? Or 
should you stay silent?
An experiment by the University of Washington Communications department 
suggested that you should reply, but there is a right way and a wrong way to 
do that.xxii They mocked up several Yelp profiles featuring the same Mexican 
restaurant, but differing only in the comments from customers and responses 
from the owner. Although the situation was fictional, the actual comments 
they chose were lifted straight from Yelp.
The negative comment was two paragraphs in length, declaring that the place 
was “not happening for me” “uninspired and mediocre.” It said the restaurant 
wouldn’t fly in a place where people were serious about their Mexican food 
and had more options. Confirming Luca’s study, the presence of one negative 
review made the likelihood of other readers to visit plummet (Figure 20-3).
The students then tested what happens if the restaurant owner gives the 
most polarized, angry response. They went to Yelp and found this one that 
was actually given by a real owner of a real restaurant:
[P]lease don’t ever come to this restaurant again; you 
are not welcome here. This site should do a better 
job of reviewing who reviews our [business]. First day 
you do a review you review two Mexican restaurant[s] 
on[e] gets 5 stars and one gets one star, give me a 
break, stick with helping your friends restaurant you 
don’t need to go out and hurt others. We don’t need 
your business.
Extreme comments, personal attacks, invoking loyalty to different groups (busi-
nesses). Smells like polarization. This response did nothing to raise intentions 

Bottlenecks
209
to visit the restaurant, nor perceptions of its quality, and it produced the lowest 
perceptions of the restaurant owner.
The study then tested the best Yelp comment they could find. They searched 
for one that exemplified the crisis communication strategy of Vincent Covello, 
Director for the New York Center for Risk Communication, who in 2009 
was regularly called in to help with political scandals and national disasters.xxiii 
Covello’s CAP approach advised that the best responses communicate caring 
(concern, empathy), action (what you have done or will do about the situa-
tion), and perspective (context or your point of view) in that order. This is the 
response they tested:
Thank you for the honest and informative comment 
and I’m sorry you had a bad experience with us. This 
is the kind of feedback we need to help us serve you 
better and, yes, hopefully stick around for the long 
haul. As a new restaurant, we are still working out 
some kinks and continue to train staff on how best to 
serve our customers. Please bear with us as our skills 
and menu grow. It’s important to know that some of 
our customers like their food a bit hotter, so we’ll add 
the option for a few more degrees of spiciness. We 
would love to invite you back and try to give you a 
better experience. In fact, we’d like to give you a free 
dish on the house. Thanks again and hope to see you 
soon. [Signed with the business owner’s real name.]
This comment negated the original negative review, returning perceptions of 
the restaurant and readers’ likelihood to visit nearly back to what it was when 
they only saw the restaurant profile (Figure 20-3). The finding suggests that 
as the maker of a meme, you shouldn’t troll the trolls, but neither should you 
leave them unanswered. Take all the design steps you can to discourage troll-
ing, and in those rare instances where you enter back into the conversation, 
make sure your own response doesn’t perpetuate the same risk factors for 
polarization. And never offer a counterargument until after you’ve killed them 
with kindness and made it all right with a refund.

Social Influence
We are finished considering what digital innovation you’ve made, how we 
process it psychologically, and why someone might recommend it to us; now 
we examine who recommended it to us and how that affects our receptivity. 
Don’t think for a minute that we adopt every meme that is recommended 
to us. Even the memes that are privileged enough to be promoted must pass 
through another social bottleneck: they must be recommended by a person 
or a group who is actually influential over our behavior.
The established field of social influence theory tells us that we will be more 
receptive to your meme if it is recommended by…
• 
Three of our peers (no fewer will suffice, no more are 
necessary)
• 
Whose motives cannot be discounted by self-interest
• 
And who are friends of our friends or enemies of our 
enemies
The first factor that determines our receptivity to your meme is the count of 
our peers who are receptive themselves. They may recommend your meme 
actively, or we may merely become aware that they have adopted it. When we 
do, we inch closer to doing so ourselves. Think back to the last tech device 
you adopted, be it your smartphone, tablet, hybrid car, or wearable. Quite 
likely, when you learned that one peer had bought one, this wasn’t enough to 
get you to do so too. But when two peers adopted it, you drew measurably 
closer to your threshold. And then you hit the magic number three.

Chapter 21 | Social Influence
214
Human cognitive and social evolution has tuned us to conform when three 
peers show a behavior. This setting is a key aspect of human social behavior. 
You can imagine how it might vary across species: flocks of birds or schools 
of salmon might need only one or two adjacent nodes to trigger conformity; 
polar bears might need, say, five or seven.
The 1955 series of experiments by psychologist Solomon Asch demonstrated 
the almost embarrassing power that three peers have to influence our behav-
ior. An unsuspecting research subject was embedded in a group of actors who 
were purposefully giving wrong answers to the simplest of visual tasks. The 
group was shown a vertical line segment and given a multiple-choice test ask-
ing which other line matched it in length (Figure 21-1a). Midway through the 
study, the actors began intentionally getting it wrong, and Asch measured how 
often the true subjects did too.
When no one was around screwing with our heads, we erred in only 1% of the 
trials; but when others erred, we did too, up to 35% of the time (Figure 21-1b).  
But here’s the interesting part. When only one other person in the room 
screwed up the test, we were not influenced, nor were we influenced very often 
when two others did. At three, we reached our threshold, and our conformity 
to others’ wrong answers hit its peak. But it was also an asymptote: when the 
number of idiots around us went up even further, to four or five or even 16, our 
rate of conformity rose no further than what it was with three peers.

Psychologist Harold Kelley explained what we were thinking in his 1973 the-
ory of attribution, which examines the causes to which we attribute others’ 
social behavior, including odd behavior like in Asch’s study.ii When only one 
peer made a mistake on Asch’s line-length task, we attributed the error to 
his or her disposition, that is, something unique to the individual such as vision, 
intelligence, or deviance. In short, we decided their behavior was due to some-
thing in their internal world, not the external world, and thus, we were not in any 
way compelled to change ourselves. When two people erred, we began to 
think perhaps something in the external world was the cause of their behavior, 
but we had one more excuse left: we decided that their behavior was tempo-
rary, that is, caused by something momentary, unstable over time, a lapse of 
reason, or a slide in the projector that loaded wrong. So again, we didn’t think 
we had to conform. But when three people showed this unexpected behavior, 
and when they showed it repeatedly, we were forced to acknowledge that a 
real change in the free-standing world must be the cause, and it was time for 
us to follow suit.
In Ash’s experiment, the power of three was so consistent, it even went the 
other way. When we were given an ally in the room who agreed with our 
correct, if rebellious, answers (making two total rebels), rather than the wrong 
answers given by others, our rate of incorrect conformity dropped off sig-
nificantly, but not completely (Figure 21-2). When we were given two other 
rebels (making three), we no longer made any mistakes at all.

Just as three points define a plane in geometry, three peers reveal a socially-
constructed truth in psychology. And right or wrong, we conform. This is 
why we need to see only three restaurant or business reviews on Yelp or 
Angie’s List (full-length reviews that is, not star ratings) to make up our minds. 
Lightspeed Research confirmed this in 2011 and Bright Local again in 2013, 
showing that reading three reviews was most common (Figure 21-3).
When we see just one bad review, we might attribute that opinion to (for 
restaurants) the pickiness of the customer or (for apps) their ineptness with 
technology, that is, some internal factor specific to them. When we see two 
bad reviews, we might think it applies only to one bad day in the kitchen or 
an earlier version of the app, that is, something temporary. But when we see 
three bad reviews spread out over time, we begin to conclude the reviews are 
reflecting the external, stable reality of the restaurant or app that we too will 
experience if we also eat there or install it. Beyond the third review, however, 
we’re not likely to even read any more, and if we do, they will have a marginal 
impact on our receptivity.
■
■Key Point  Conformity reaches an asymptote after three others influence us, so accordingly, 
few people read more than three online reviews.

Kelley’s attribution theory also helps us understand why we are less recep-
tive to reviews from certain parties. When the recommender seems to have 
an incentive, other than the quality of the product itself, we engage in attri-
butional discounting. This means we lose confidence in the quality of a 
meme when a positive recommendation for it appears to be caused by self-
interest. Negative reviews can also be discounted, and our confidence in a 
meme increased, if you appear to be criticizing a meme that competes with 
your own.
This is why you, as the creator of your meme, are among the least influential 
or persuasive recommenders. We discount the strength of your site, app, or 
blog post as the impetus for your recommendation, since we assume you 
stand to gain attention or revenue for promoting it. Of course Tim Cook 
likes the Apple iWatch, we reason to ourselves, his stock holdings depend on 
it; so perhaps the iWatch is not as great as he says it is. This is an example of 
discounting.
As such, all things being equal, we should be more receptive to a retweet about 
your meme than to your original tweet about it. This is because we discount 
your original tweet of your own product, due to your self-interest in its suc-
cess, whereas when someone else who has no financial stake in it retweets it, 
we attribute their actions to the product itself. Allrecipes.com, the world’s 
largest cooking site, verified this in a survey of 621 site visitors in 2011.iv We 
liked retweets more than original tweets, and we less often perceived them 
to be bald-faced advertisements (Figure 21-4). But most importantly, we were 
more willing to click the links in retweets than in original tweets. Because 
these links brought attention to Allrecipes or its partner advertisers, the dif-
ference in our receptivity directly impacted their revenues.

Discounting is also a big problem on Yelp and Amazon. Both sites have grappled 
with restaurant owners and authors who fraudulently pay people to promote 
some products and detract from others. After years of complaints, Yelp took 
to deleting suspicious posts, but this was not enough to quell the problem. So 
finally in 2015, Yelp began alerting us of fraudulent reviews and even showed us 
to the screenshot evidence (Figure 21-5). Yelp “wanted you to know because 
these actions not only hurt consumers, but also honest businesses who play 
by the rules.” What they also should have said was that our discounting of 
the reviews, the eroding of our confidence in them and in the restaurants 
and books they claimed to represent, was also bad for Yelp. Crowd-sourced 
reviews are among the most important content that such sites possess.
All told, discounting is a big reason that social media has turned out to be 
a poor place for direct-advertising and calls-to-action in which you ask us 
directly to view or buy things. Because they are presumed to be “social,” 
Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook give us the expectation that it is a place 
for organic conversation between real humans, which may occasionally refer-
ence brands or products. But almost every social-media marketing consultant 
advises that it is better to tweet truly informative content or customer-ser-
vice messages than it is to promote offers. Nielsen confirmed this in a 2013 
global survey, showing that while 84% of us trusted “recommendations from 
people I know,” and 68% of us trusted “consumer opinions posted online,” 
only 48% of us trusted “ads served on social networks”.v
■
■Key Point  The appearance of self-interest leads us to discount recommendations. This is why 
we are more persuaded by retweets than by original tweets.

Not all recommendations influence our receptivity, nor do we give all recom-
menders equal weight. Social influence theory also holds that the strength of 
their relationship to us and their psychological immediacy (Chapter 18) also 
matters. Your spouse influences your receptivity more so than your friends, 
and he or she influences you more when standing in your bathroom than 
when sending a text.
Leveraging this, the cheeky 2010 Old Spice ad campaign featuring a ridicu-
lously attractive male actor saying “I’m the man your man could smell like” 
had a subtle but powerful nuance: it encouraged spouses to recommend the 
product to their men. Spouses have as strong and immediate influence on our 
behavior as it gets. By the end of 2010, year-over-year sales of Old Spice body 
wash shot up 125%.vi
When a meme is recommended to one of us, there are three parties involved: 
myself, the recommender, and the meme being recommended. Way back 
in 1946, psychologist Fritz Heidervii examined these triadic relationships and 
concluded that only four patterns were in balance. Put in terms of memes, 
Heider’s balance theory would hold that…
I like memes (+) promoted (+) by people I like (+).
I like memes (+) criticized (-) by people I dislike (-).
I dislike memes (-) promoted (+) by people I dislike (-).
I dislike memes (-) criticized (-) by people I like (+).
The signs represent the positive or negative sentiment between the peo-
ple and objects. We know these patterns are in balance because, as Heider 
showed, when you multiply the three signs the product is positive. When this 
happens, the arrangement will say stable over time and not change. Taking an 
example from the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, we would be in balance if 
we liked (+) the idea of legalizing marijuana, promoted (+) by a candidate we 
liked (+) such as Bernie Sanders (Figure 21-6).

What happens if the product of the signs is negative and the triad is out of 
balance? What if all of a sudden, for example, Donald Trump whom we disliked 
(-) promotes (+) legalized marijuana (+), and the product of the valences is 
negative? Such a state of affairs is awkward and unsettling, that is, out of bal-
ance. So what would happen? Heider’s answer was simple: something tends to 
change. His key insight was that the most mutable part of these relationships 
was the first part of the sentences above: our attitude toward a meme. So in 
this example, we would most likely turn against legalized pot. We strive to 
keep our positive relationships friendly, and we change our negative relation-
ships slowly if at all. And when someone promotes or criticizes someone or 
something publicly to others, it is hard to walk back. So the easiest thing to 
change is our own opinions, and this is what makes us receptive to influence. 
Put another way, we often come to like or dislike memes to signal our fond-
ness for our friends and maintain harmony and loyalty.
Heider’s balance theory also applies to triadic relationships between 
people…
I like people (+) promoted (+) by people I like (+).
I like people (+) criticized (-) by people I dislike (-).
I dislike people (-) promoted (+) by people I dislike (-).
I dislike people (-) criticized (-) by people I like (+).
This echoes the ancient phrase dating back to the 4th century B.C. that “the 
friend of my friend is my friend, and the enemy of my enemy is also my friend.” 
But fast-forward to 2010, and Heider’s historic predictions were found to 
apply perfectly to the modern environment of a massive multiplayer online 
video game.
In the game Pardus, launched in 2004, players were enabled to “live in a virtual, 
futuristic universe in which they explore and where they interact with oth-
ers in a multitude of ways to achieve their own goals” (Figure 21-7). The key 
to the study was the fact that we could declare whether other players were 
“friends” or “enemies.”

221
■
■Key Point  Massive multiplayer games confirm half-century old predictions about triadic 
relationships.
A team of researchers led by Michael Szell noticed that this was the per-
fect environment to test Heider’s theory.viii Szell’s team analyzed the relation-
ships and interactions of nearly all 300K Pardus players since the game was 
launched (Figure 21-8). They found that, as predicted, interactions between 
balanced—(+)(+)(+)=(+) and (+)(-)(-)=(+)—triads were common, whereas 
interactions between imbalanced—(+)(+)(-)=(-) and (-)(-)(-)=(-)—triads were 
rare. Digging deeper, they found that we didn’t often switch the valence of 
our relationships from positive to negative, which Heider argued was slower 
to change than our attitudes. Instead, we just avoided interactions with these 
unbalanced and unsettling threesomes.

Heider’s theory also has another implication: balance can be achieved in three-
somes, but it breaks down in foursomes. LinkedIn found this out when they 
tried to leverage an obvious usefulness of their network: asking someone to 
introduce you to another.
For years, a graphic on LinkedIn informed us that although we may be only 
connected to a few hundred people directly, we were connected to thou-
sands of second-degree professionals and millions of third-degree profession-
als (Figure 21-9). Thus getting referred to scads of people who might hire us 
or bring business opportunities seemed to be something that was possible on 
LinkedIn’s network. For sure, getting introduced to our second-degree con-
nections through a friend in common was indeed a valuable gift to the world. 
This was a straightforward application of Heider’s balance theory: I like people 
(+) referred (+) by people I like (+).
But it only works for three total people, which means LinkedIn only helps us 
get introduced to second-degree friends but no one beyond that. In Heider’s 
terms, the people that I like (+) cannot refer someone they don’t know per-
sonally (?) even if that person likes someone (+) whom they like (+). Writing 
for Forbes, consultant Carol Ross wrote in 2013, “Bottom line: I don’t recom-
mend requesting an introduction to someone who is a third-degree connec-
tion. Keep your requests to second-degree connections, where you and the 
person you’d like to be introduced to have someone in common.”x
By 2014, LinkedIn had acknowledged this bottleneck of social influence and 
shelved the feature. Their customer service reported, “We’ve recently made a 
change preventing requests to third+ degree connections, as it created a poor 
experience which relied on a chain of actions for multiple users in order for

two members to be introduced. At this time, we recommend InMails be used 
to reach out to third-degree connections.”xi
■
■Key Point  You can have someone refer you successfully to a third party on LinkedIn, but that 
third party won’t be able to refer you successfully to a fourth party without getting to know you first.
The lesson in this is that your startup will never be able to start a viral cascade 
with a “friends and family” launch through your followers on social media. 
Your friends do indeed like you (+) and therefore they will like your meme 
(+) and they will dutifully plug it for their friends (+). But past that, out into the 
next ring of connections, their friends will have no receptivity to your meme 
based on your reputation alone.
The only way for the cascade to continue is if someone else along the way 
stakes their own reputation on it. Don’t worry, it happens. If you are careful 
and sensitive and diligent and artistic and you make sure to align your ideas 
with our psychology and our life’s goals, we will gladly vouch for it. We don’t 
need to be paid to recommend ideas with excellent memetic fitness, and thus 
no one will discount our sincerity. Our friends (+) will like the memes (+) that 
we promote (+). And upon the third such recommendation, they will reach 
their receptivity thresholds too and start the process again.

Receptivity 
Thresholds
The last chapter introduced the idea of receptivity. This implied that we 
range from low to high in how receptive we are to adopting your digital 
innovation. Despite what our friends advise us about your meme, we don’t 
always “check it out.” We don’t always register. Or download. Or use it (or 
use it often). Or recommend it. Or pay for it. All of these are indicators as  
to whether we were receptive to your meme—or happy to have it blocked by 
our bottlenecks, like so much other noise on the network.
■
■Key Point  The opposite of a meme being blocked by a psychological bottleneck is a meme 
that finds a receptive user.
The previous chapter showed that even with great memes, the social forces 
at play in who recommends it to us and how matter to our receptivity. We’re 
more receptive when three people recommend something than one, when it 
comes from someone with a strong, positive relationship with us, and when 
promoters are in our faces and immediate rather than recommending from a 
distance.

Chapter 22 | Receptivity Thresholds
228
All of this frames receptivity at the individual level, focusing on the intra-psy-
chological factors inside one brain. However, you must also think about how 
receptivity matters at the network level. Here, receptivity works in concert 
with other factors to determine the viral spread of your meme, things like the 
size of the network (the number of people), its architecture (is it a hierarchical 
corporation or a regular neighborhood), connectedness (whether everyone 
knows everyone or only a few others), and cliques (whether some folks in the 
network are cut off and know no one in other networks).
In this chapter, we take a look at emerging research that suggests that receptiv-
ity should be a key concern of yours in the successful launch of your digital venture. 
For decades, marketing consultants have advised you to launch to “influen-
tials” who are connected to a great many others. But emerging studies suggest 
that the receptiveness of the many is more important than the connectedness of 
a few in triggering a viral spread.
Psychology, which has guided our advice to you so far, has over the course of 
its 150-year history focused mainly on individual organisms (and some small 
groups and families), but far less on the community or social networks. So 
while it has taught you a lot about how and if your meme enters one brain 
and gets passed to a second, all that drama involving perception, memory, and 
motivation now gets reduced to one node in the network as we zoom out to 
look at a whole species. And to be sure, a species is a different beast than the 
organisms of which it is comprised.
Any time a large number of nodes self-assemble into a network as complex as 
ours, new entities will emerge with properties that are entirely different than 
their constituent parts. A snowflake has properties entirely different than 
water molecules; a crocodile has properties entirely different than its eukary-
otic cells. Just so, the shape and behavior of human networks may be entirely 
different than individual humans, requiring you to understand it as well.
How can you steer a company through the chaotic world of your customer 
network? Start by hiring some data scientists to plot your customers’ social 
graph. Simply visualizing your own network of users can be an extremely 
useful tool in understanding the challenges your meme faces at launch.
Illustrating that powerfully was the data visualization created in 2015 by a 
team of data scientists in Washington D.C. (Figure 22-1)i It takes only a glance 
to see how Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives 
more often voted for each other’s bills in 1983 than they did in 2011. This is 
a classic example of a network clique where only a few mavens bridge oth-
erwise disconnected networks. Before seeing this, you might think that the 
receptivity of one party to the memes of another was an individual-level prob-
lem; here, we realize it’s a network-level problem. It likely doesn’t arise from 
the individual values of lawmakers, but rather from systemic factors in the way 

Bottlenecks

their districts elect them. And it doesn’t result in just a dampening of biparti-
san legislation; the networks are almost totally cut off from each other. From 
this view, you can count the number who actually “reach across the aisle.”

■
■Key Point  Understanding the properties of the network in which you want your meme to 
spread is key. Receptivity should be a focus at the individual level and the network level.

Chapter 22 | Receptivity Thresholds
230
Merely seeing your target network is a great first step to making more strate-
gic decisions to help your meme spread through it. But there’s another more 
executive way to begin thinking productively about networks and start asking 
smarter questions to the data scientists that you hire. This is by leveraging a 
hypothesis-generating process called metapatterning.
Metapatterning is using a well-understood system as a metaphor to develop 
hypotheses about similar systems that are of interest to you. Charles Darwin used 
pigeon-breeding as a metaphor to articulate his theory of natural selection. 
Richard Dawkins used genes as a metaphor to describe the adaptive radiation 
of memes. Jeffrey Rayport is credited with first using the virus metaphor to 
refer to viral marketing strategies, although by that point it was already being 
used to explain computer malware.ii
Looking again at the graph in Figure 22-1 about the U.S. Congress, it could just 
as easily represent airline networks, the spread of Ebola, or neurons in our 
brain. Networks are found in living and non-living systems alike, and in this way, 
understanding any one system can help you understand the system that makes 
your company money. That’s metapatterning.
Kevin Kelly, the executive editor of Wired magazine, believes that metapattern-
ing is essential to progress in technology:
“The more mechanical we make our fabricated environment, the more 
biological it will eventually have to be if it is to work at all. The world of our 
own making has become so complicated that we must turn to the world 
of the ’born’ to understand how to manage it. Ancient metaphors…of a 
machine as organism and an organism as machine are as old as the first 
machine itself. But now those enduring metaphors are no longer poetry. 
They are becoming real – profitably real.” iii
So, if you want to start providing immediate leadership about your user net-
work, begin by likening other well-known networks to your own. Pick the 
one you know best or that interests you most and read up on it. It could be 
airlines, electrical grids, diseases, or our favorite, the nervous system. Then 
start asking your data scientists better questions with your metaphor in mind.
In every network there are…
Nodes, which are the entities connected (we think 
nodes is clearer than vertices, the plural of vertex, as 
they’re sometimes called)
Links, which are the connections (we like links better 
than edges when talking about people, but we also like 
channels)
Signals, that which spreads through the network (in 
your case, memes)

Bottlenecks
231
These vary from strong to weak:
Hub nodes are highly connected nodes with many 
links
Bridge (or maven) nodes connect what would 
otherwise be isolated cliques
(Low) threshold nodes are those that readily for-
ward memes on
Strong links readily reach the threshold of the next 
node
Strong signals spread further and faster than weak 
signals
Can the list of network properties above and a little metapatterning help us 
understand the 2007 debate about influentials that classic marketing gurus 
Ed Keller and Jonathan Berry had with network scientists Duncan Watts and 
Peter Dodds?
Keller and Berry built an entire literature around the idea that if your meme 
is recommended by highly-connected influentials, it will have a much better 
chance of spreading. Targeting influentials can indeed be strategic because it 
gets the word out without spending the money to canvass everyone through 
direct-marketing. “If word of mouth is like a radio signal broadcast over the 
country, influentials are the strategically placed transmitters that amplify the 
signal, multiplying dramatically the number of people who hear it.” Keller and 
Berry wrote in 2003.iv By also defining influentials as thought leaders, well-
read, cool, and/or political, Keller and Berry argued that others would be 
receptive to their recommendations.
Enough multinational companies like Nike have succeeded with the endorse-
ments of élite athletes or celebrities that some part of the influentials hypoth-
esis must be true. And as we saw in Chapter 18, attractive spokespeople are 
known to be effective peripheral routes to persuasion, especially when your 
value proposition is weak or lacks differentiators (like T-shirts and tennis 
shoes). All of the thought-leaders in this debate agree with the same 1955 
two-step flow theory of marketing by Katz and Lazarsfeld,v which holds that 
the TV alone almost never drives sales directly; instead, commercials almost 
always drive a recommendation that gets someone to a checkout line.
But one thing influentials do not do any better than anyone else is help things 
go viral.

Chapter 22 | Receptivity Thresholds
232
This blockbuster conclusion that Watts and Dodds arrived at in a 2007 mod-
eling exercisevi was stunning, since the key feature of influentials is that they 
are connected to a much larger number of people than the rest of us. No one 
disputes this part. Most organic networks are what network scientists call 
scale-free, meaning the connectedness of nodes range from gigantic hubs 
with millions of connections (think Ashton Kutcher or Kim Kardashian) to 
sparsely connected satellites with few connections (your 81 year-old neighbor 
Marty who emails you using his iPad Mini). Thus, if influentials are hubs, then 
their recommendations can and do reach more first-degree relationships than 
others among us.
But if you follow the memes that influentials recommend out to the second- 
or third-degree, Watts and Dodds found that the typical viral cascade started 
by influentials does not have an appreciably greater reach than the cascades 
started by than anyone else. As Watts and Dodds put it, “Cascades do not 
succeed because of a few highly influential individuals influencing everyone 
else, but rather on account of a critical mass of easily influenced individuals 
influencing other easy-to-influence people.”
In network terms, this early finding (we look forward to more research) found 
that low-threshold nodes are a greater predictor of the reach of viral cas-
cades than highly connected hubs. Receptivity is key. The subtitle of Keller 
and Berry’s book said One American in ten tells the other nine how to vote, where 
to eat, and what to buy. Watts and Dodds essentially found that, but what is 
important is that they do.
■
■Key Point  Emerging studies suggest that the receptiveness of the many is more important 
than the connectedness of a few in triggering a viral spread.
What metaphor summarizes this? Let’s try airlines. Keller and Berry essen-
tially argue to start your journey at big hubs like Heathrow or Atlanta. Watts 
and Dodds say it’s better to plan your trip through airports with the most 
on-time connections, like Salt Lake City or Ronald Reagan.

Makes great sense, but Watts and Dodds used metapatterning even more 
poetically:
“Although [our] claim may seem implausible in light of 
received wisdom, it has numerous analogues in natu-
ral systems. Some forest fires, for example, are many 
times larger than average; yet no one would claim that 
the size of a forest fire can be in any way attributed to 
the exceptional properties of the spark that ignited it 
or the size of the tree that was the first to burn. Major 
forest fires require a conspiracy of wind, temperature, 
low humidity, and combustible fuel that extends over 
large tracts of land. Just as for large cascades in social 
influence networks, when the right global combination 
of conditions exists, any spark will do; when it does 
not, none will suffice.”
Receptivity is just that: a conspiracy of attention, perception, memory, disposition, 
motivation, and social-influence. When the right combination of psychological 
conditions exists, any meme has a chance; when it does not, none will survive.
This closer look at whether influentials actually influence anyone prompted 
many web giants from Twitter to Klout to LinkedIn to improve their for-
mulae for VIPs. They realized that you may tweet your idea to your many 
followers, but it is our mass willingness to retweet that makes your tweet go 
viral. The makers of the Klout score, a metric purporting to measure influ-
ence, had to stop simply measuring your number of connections, and make 
their score take into consideration whether any of your recipients passed it 
on.vii LinkedIn scrapped definitions of influentials based purely on connection-
counts to instead hand-pick 500 influencers (including Richard Branson, Bill 
Gates, and Arianna Huffington) and work with them to publish long-form 
posts on their network.
This was an improvement. A promoter who recommends a meme to people 
who are not receptive is a spammer. A detractor who hates on a meme to 
deaf ears is a troll. Nobody wins and nobody loses if nobody’s listening. The 
meme that is recommended to a network of the unreceptive doesn’t spread.
Influentials are still important. The scope of Keller and Berry’s hypothesis was 
sharpened, not scrapped. Their formulation still applies well to hierarchical 
networks, like corporations or militaries, with a well-defined top-down chain 
of command. But the strength of the links between managers and reports 
is far more assured than in organic, scale-free networks, where some people 
influence us only weakly. Out here in the organic fabric of everyday networks, 
all of us have to choose how how to invest our attention into memes, and 
the only authorities are psychological and social. Out in the marketplace, we 
don’t reach our receptivity thresholds and allow memes to pass through our 
psychological bottlenecks because we’re told to. We only do it if we want to.

Chapter 22 | Receptivity Thresholds
234
The notion that corporate networks are not consumer networks teaches an impor-
tant lesson about metapatterning. Metaphors are only helpful if they are appli-
cable. Network science is starting to show us how to measure and quantify 
the similarity between systems, starting with networks. When this matures, 
it will be a great help to leveraging our understanding from one domain into 
another. In the next chapter, we trace the origins of network science as we 
consider just how far your meme can spread if it gets it completely right.

Six Degrees of 
Recommendation
So let’s say you’ve achieved perfect alignment between the design of your 
digital innovation and our psychological bottlenecks, and in that way, our 
receptivity is maximized. Just how many recommendations would it take to 
reach everyone?
Did we just say everyone? Believe we did. And we meant everyone. On planet 
Earth.
By 2015, Microsoft Office was used by 1.2 billion people in 107 languages; 
Google search by at least 1.2 billion in 130 languages; and Facebook by at least 
1.6 billion in 142 languages.i Each of those companies spread faster than the 
last, albeit only to one or two sevenths of the world population. How long 
would it take your (perfected) meme to reach everyone? Microsoft’s CEO 
Satya Nadella challenged his company to empower everyone on the planet to 
achieve more. Can that be done in a reasonable amount of time?
We will close out this discussion with a consideration of the speed by which 
a meme with peak memetic fitness could spread throughout the global meme 
pool, and the science that had to be invented to assess that. To answer the 
question of how long might it take a meme to reach 100% of us, scientists 
needed to understand the shape of humanity, the architecture of the global 
human network.

Chapter 23 | Six Degrees of Recommendation
236
■
■Key Point  How many “degrees” of recommendations would it take for your meme to reach 
everyone on Earth?
Yes, the final question we’re asking you to consider is how many “degrees” of 
recommendations would it take for your meme to reach everyone. One of us 
tells someone who tells someone…that’s three. To reach 100% of us, would it 
take far too many recommendations to happen in your lifetime? Or is it some 
number that is still huge, but small enough to reasonably strive for?
Or is it six?
Six degrees of recommendation to achieve total memetic fitness, to spread to 
the entire human population? That…that could conceivably happen between 
now and your next cup of coffee. Between the launch of your meme and the 
end of the launch party. That would smoke Gangnam Style. The South Korean 
rapper Psy, who in 2013 put out an irreverent song making fun of the rich part 
of town, earned 2.4 billion views on YouTube in less than three years. So is it 
actually possible to get 7 billion users in less than an hour? That is, in less than 
six recommendations?
To measure whether that is possible with any degree of reliability, the world 
needed a new science.
That new discipline, alluded to in the previous chapter, is called network 
science, and although it has as many origins as it has applications, it is not 
too great a stretch to say it was social psychologist Stanley Milgram who, 
in the late 1960s, first encouraged it to take itself seriously. He did that by 
embracing the mind-trip now known as six degrees of separation, which 
had been smoldering in literature for several decades but was impossible to 
test rigorously. Understanding that history will not only reveal whether six 
recommendations could spread your meme to everyone, it will also show you 
what kind of courage is needed to spread a really big meme like a brand new 
science. Or the internet itself.
Six degrees of separation. We’re guessing you’ve heard of this meme, or perhaps 
already accept is as axiomatic. The claim is that any two people on planet 
Earth, chosen at random, can be connected through a chain of six acquain-
tances (or five links or hops). Any two people, and every two people, not just 
celebrities, and not just Kevin Bacon. Choose even the most obscure, everyday 
two of us from the most distant corners of the globe, and we could recom-
mend an idea to each other through only four intermediate acquaintances 
whom we know on a first-name basis. That’s the claim.

Bottlenecks
237
Mind you, no telecommunications network comes anywhere close to reach-
ing everyone. No internet. No electrical grid. No airline network. Not even 
the worst diseases like AIDS or SARS. The network we’re talking about is the 
network of human acquaintances. Our relationships. “Do I know Peggy? Why, 
sure I do. She was the one who introduced me to sushi.” That network. The 
social network sans social media.
The six-degrees claim is provocative because it’s shocking—shockingly low. 
Regardless whether one argues that six is the longest path needed to con-
nect any two people on Earth (the diameter in the terminology of network 
science) or the shortest path (the radius), or the mean path length, or the 
median—there were 2 billion people on Earth when this idea was hatched 
and 7 billion now, so six just seems preposterous. If true, this would mean that 
if a native of Jakarta, Indonesia recommends the smartphone app that you 
invented to a friend, it would take only four more recommendations to reach 
people in Jackson, Wyoming, Jabalpur, India, Joal-Fadiouth, Senegal, Juliaca, Peru, 
Jastrzębie Zdrój, Poland, and every other corner of the globe.
So, is it true? Is it possible?
Well, testing this claim remained something of an unreachable intellectual opi-
ate for almost a century. Scientists had neither the mathematics to formalize 
the question nor the infrastructure to test it empirically.
The first person to describe the six-degrees question was Hungarian writer 
Frigyes Karinthy in a piece called “Chain-Links” published in 1929.ii In a 
Socratic-style dialogue between a character called Chesterton and the narra-
tor, Karinthy wrote:
“One of us suggested performing the following expe-
riment to prove that the population of the Earth is 
closer together now than it has ever been before. We 
should select any person from the 1.5 billion inhabi-
tants of the Earth - anyone, anywhere at all. He bet us 
that, using no more than five individuals, one of whom 
is a personal acquaintance, he could contact the selec-
ted individual using nothing except the network of 
personal acquaintances. For example, ’Look, you know 
Mr. X.Y., please ask him to contact his friend Mr. Q.Z., 
whom he knows, and so forth.’”
Karinthy then tried to trace acquaintance-chains between himself, Nobel 
Laureates, and even “an anonymous riveter at the Ford Motor Company,” 
whom he believed he could reach in four jumps.

Chapter 23 | Six Degrees of Recommendation
238
The six-degrees meme then split and went two separate directions, one in 
mathematics and one in literature. Both were slow-burning and murky. In 
mathematics, the idea was termed “the small world problem” after the out-
burst we make when we discover a completed acquaintance chain. (“Wow, 
what a small world!”). In literature, a much more artful phrase was born in the 
title of a 1990 play by John Guare, titled “Six Degrees of Separation.”iii
I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is 
separated by only six other people. Six degrees of 
separation. Between us and everybody else on this pla-
net. The president of the United States. A gondolier 
in Venice. Fill in the names. I find that a) tremendously 
comforting that we’re so close and b) like Chinese 
water torture that we’re so close. Because you have 
to find the right six people to make the connection…I 
am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six 
people. It’s a profound thought.
Bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people. A profound thought 
indeed. Although Guare’s work inspired a motion picture, a breakthrough 
online social network called SixDegrees.com, and later even a TV series 
directed by J. J. Abrams, he inadvertently threw off the emerging scientists of 
network theory by attributing his idea to the wrong source. Instead of cit-
ing Karinthy or others in the humanities, he attributed it as late as 1999 to 
Guglielmo Marconi,iv who with Karl Braun won a 1909 Nobel prize in phys-
ics for their work on wireless telegraphs. Unfortunately, Marconi did not in 
fact, propose a network theory in his Nobel acceptance speechv or anywhere 
else. By 2010, Guare began attributing his idea more appropriately to Stanley 
Milgram,vi but that’s getting ahead of the story.
Guare could be forgiven, in a sense, because the mathematicians who were in 
fact tackling the six-degrees prediction stayed underground with their work 
for, incredibly, over 20 years. Those scholars were Ithiel de Sola Pool and 
Manfred Kochen from the University of Paris. Around 1958, they had begun a 
manuscript that just seemed to raise more questions than it answered. Thus 
it stayed under the table in unpublished form. De Sola Pool took a job at MIT 
and convinced young Michael Gurevich to do his dissertation on the topic in 
1961,vii but it would still be until 1978 before they published “Contacts and 
Influence” in the inaugural issue of Social Networks, and even then with some 
pretty strong reservations.viii
Here are the essential aspects of their mathematical claim. Supporting the 
idea that all humans are connected in six jumps starts easily enough: if we each 
have 1,000 friends, then we have a million friends-of-friends, a billion friends-
of-friends-of-friends, and a trillion people “with three intermediaries.” The 
entire human population must necessarily be connected to us with plenty of 
jumps to spare.

Bottlenecks
239
But de Sola Pool’s team had no empirical data on how many acquaintances 
we in fact have. The only sociometric studies available at this time had been 
done on kids in preschools. So they imputed the 200 number that Gurevich 
estimated (history ultimately proving him not too far off), and the prediction 
of six jumps held up, but they felt like this was a pretty big assumption.
Next, they realized they didn’t know how social classes and cliques might 
throw off their models. Class was hard to ignore here. In all likelihood, the 
six-degrees prediction struck so many as shockingly low (including Ouisa in 
Guare’s play) because it meant the lowest classes were only a few friends 
removed from the highest—despite all erstwhile efforts at segregation. Even if 
the poor and the rich weren’t completely cut off from each other, it seemed 
like their acquaintance chains should at least be longer than those from poor 
to poor or rich to rich. De Sola Pool’s model had to account for this. And it 
had to account for all the other cliques formed by race, ethnicities, neighbor-
hoods, workplaces, schools, and fans of sports teams mingling in the same 
stadiums. In all, you see why De Sola Pool wrote, “The central problem that 
prevents an entirely satisfactory model is that we do not know how to deal 
with the structuredness of the population.”
They adjusted their models to account for structuredness best they could, 
but once again only with big assumptions about the number, size, and nature of 
classes and cliques. The biggest assumption of all was that they treated all of 
these social groupings exactly alike. Agonizing over these problems took years.
But the delay may have been fortuitous, because in the late 1950s, psychologist 
Stanley Milgram had visited de Sola Pool and Kochen in Paris and told them of 
a way they might test the six-degrees prediction by sending letters.
Milgram, the genius 1960s-era experimentalist, influenced all aspects of social 
psychology with a fearlessness inspired by trying to prevent another Holocaust. 
Around that time, Milgram had been tinkering with a lost letter technique 
in which he essentially hacked the postal service to assess prejudice.ix That 
story is for another day, but Milgram was emboldened to try to test the six-
degrees prediction with real letters. (Milgram himself never used the term “six 
degrees of separation,” preferring the term used by the mathematicians and 
network scientists to this day, “the small world problem.”) Rather than send 
letters through the postal service, Milgram’s idea was to send letters through 
the still undigitized network of social acquaintances.
So in 1969, Jeffrey Travers and Milgram made 296 letters.x They fully explained 
the purpose of the study on the outside of the envelopes: to see if the letters 
would get to an arbitrarily chosen target person, and to measure how many 
friends it took to get there. Anyone who got the letter was instructed to mail 
it directly only if they “previously met the target person and know each other 
on a first name basis.” Otherwise, they should mail the letters “to a friend, 
relative, or acquaintance,” whom they felt could get it closer, “but it must be 
someone you know personally.”

Chapter 23 | Six Degrees of Recommendation
240
The target person was a stockholder living in Sharon, Massachusetts, whose 
name, address, employer, college, military service, and wife’s maiden name and 
hometown were disclosed in the document. In terms of network science, 
these details meant that the target was not a node, but instead a little weblet 
in a larger social graph.
Travers and Milgram started the letters with 100 Nebraskans who were 
stockholders just like the target, 96 additional Nebraskans recruited via the 
newspaper, and 100 Bostonians also recruited via a newspaper. You see what 
Milgram was doing here: he was trying to test how class and geography might 
affect the length of the acquaintance chains. But he and Travers already began 
to worry about the receptivity of people who were drawn into the study. The 
fate of many of the letters would be scientific black holes caused by apathy: 
abandoned file drawers, trash cans, or landfills. Bottlenecked and forgotten. 
So they instructed every participant who sent the letter on to also mail an 
enclosed postcard back to Milgram’s lab. Worse, they realized that incomplete 
chains were ambiguous in their interpretation: did they mean that no acquain-
tance chain existed to connect the two people? Or that it was too weak to 
pass a meme through? Or did incomplete chains mean that an acquaintance 
chain existed but was simply unknown to the people in it?
This bold first study itself limped into publication with imperfect results and 
Milgram’s frustrations. Seventy-nine letters never even got started, and two 
hundred thirty-two didn’t make it to the end. But of those that did, Milgram 
wrote, “The mean distribution is 5.2 links.”
Five point two. Shockingly low. And under six. The maximum length of com-
pleted chains was 11 jumps—still shockingly low. And the letters that didn’t 
arrive seemed to be killed by a lack of motivation to take part in the study, 
rather than be passed around in long chains or endless loops. In fact, incom-
plete chains had an average of only 2.6 jumps and a maximum of 14. There was 
no data here to suggest that the world wasn’t small, at least the small world of 
the American population. Karinthy wasn’t wrong. But Milgram’s study wasn’t 
enough to prove that he was right. Surely the next study came out soon after? 
No. Another 30 years would pass before anyone published a new mathematical 
model and tried to replicate this study.
But by that point, we had email.
Working at Cornell University in New York in 1998, Duncan Watts and 
Steven Strogatz (Figure 23-1) had figured out the mathxi and a way to test all 
this online. The divergent backgrounds of these two scholars cast them per-
fectly in this tale of connection. Strogatz was a brilliant mild-mannered math 
student from Connecticut who, by his own admission, had more in common

with his calculus teachers growing up than with girls. He was a tenured pro-
fessor at the time he met Watts, who was a former Australian naval cadet just 
as comfortable sharp-shooting, rock climbing, and extreme skiing as he was 
building algorithmic models. Watts later worked at Yahoo! and at Microsoft. 
Strogatz would often marvel at the serendipity of global networks that even 
brought them together.xii
Figure 23-1.  Founding network scientists Steven Strogatz (left) and Duncan Watts (right).
Together, they had hit upon an elegant way to take into consideration both 
the “structuredness” of our relationships (that greater likelihood of forming 
acquaintance-chains between “nearby” others in both the physical and social-
stratification senses) as well as the many odd, unlikely connections we make in 
our winding travels. Their model started with the most structured network 
possible, a nightmare of insular provincialism really, in which we are connected 
to only a few nearby neighbors. These lattice networks are neat and comfort-
ing to look upon when they are drawn (Figure 23-2), but notice what happens 
when you try to pass a meme between any two points: it must traverse every 
link and node in between them in a long, laborious chain. This is not a small 
world, quite the opposite. When we only connect locally, we make the rest of 
the world more distant.

Chapter 23 | Six Degrees of Recommendation
242
So Watts and Strogatz measured what happens when a few random, distant 
friendships are mixed in with these locals-only webs. They programmed their 
models to connect random pairs of people, just like what happens when we 
meet others in university dormitories or on business trips or sitting next to 
us at concerts, or soccer matches, or on ski lifts (Figure 23-3).
Figure 23-2.  Lattice networks in which each node is only connected to nearby neighbors. 
For (a), six jumps are needed to connect the most distant nodes; for (b), four are needed.
Figure 23-3. A lattice network with the addition of a few random “small world” connections

to three.

243
Essentially, they took the opposite approach from de Sola Pool and Kochen, 
who assumed a globally-connected world and made exceptions for cliques. 
Watts and Strogatz assumed a world of cliques and made exceptions for 
globe-bridging friendships.
They got the idea from Mark Granovetter, who coined the phrase the 
strength of weak ties in 1973.xiii Granovetter argued that ideas will “tra-
verse greater social distance (i.e., path length) when passed through weak 
ties rather than strong.” Insular groups of strongly-tied people can only share 
the same ideas over and over (even jokes). For a meme to travel, it needs 
those weaker, more fleeting connections that bridge distant sectors of the 
larger network. The formation of enough random ties eventually produces 
networks that look more like real life. They are the scale-free networks we 
talked about last chapter in which there is a huge range in the number of con-
nections each of us has (Figure 23-4). Some of us remain connected to only 
a few local contacts, while others are hubs connected to hundreds of others, 
near and far.
Figure 23-4. A scale-free network.

Chapter 23 | Six Degrees of Recommendation
244
Watts and Strogatz immediately saw that the result of infusing a few random, 
weak-tie bridges into a lattice network was dramatic: those long chains that 
formerly connected any two nodes were now vastly shortened by these interpersonal 
shortcuts. This held true even with billions of nodes the size of the human grid. 
With relatively few of these bridges, they reaffirmed that the six-degrees claim 
was still mathematically plausible.
The key thing that shrinks the world is those random connections. Immediately, 
this tells you that if you want to go viral, look for ways to launch your meme 
to distant hot-spots. Tell the person sitting next to you on flights about it. 
Give talks at conferences in distant countries and semi-related fields. Set up 
satellite headquarters around the globe. The results could be dramatic. For 
example, Brazil turned out to be a huge hub for both Microsoft’s Hotmail and 
Google’s social network Orkut. Was that foreseen, or just fortunate?
■
■Key Point  Recommendations of your memes to distant, random others in the social graph 
dramatically improve their chances of a viral cascade.
But the six-degrees myth really entered the global digital age when Watts 
went on to test it in email, working with colleagues Peter Dodds and Roby 
Muhamad.xiv Participants joined a web site where they were randomly assigned 
to one of 18 target persons spread across 13 countries. Some of the most 
notable targets were “a professor at an Ivy League university, an archival 
inspector in Estonia, a technology consultant in India, a policeman in Australia, 
and a veterinarian in the Norwegian army.” Using email, participants in the 
study were asked to pass a message closer to the target.
Despite the global scope, the average number of links was 4.05 for completed 
chains, and about 7 for uncompleted chains. Close enough to declare Karinthy 
and Guare correct. We are bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six 
people.
Since then, a variety of other social media networks have been analyzed. 
Looking at the Windows Messenger network in 2007 (before Microsoft 
rebranded it Skype), Jure Leskovec and Eric Horvitz found that “A random 
pair of nodes in the Messenger network is 6.6 hops apart on the average.”xv
Then in 2011, Facebook data scientists analyzed their network of 721 million 
active users, reporting that, “as Facebook has grown over the years, repre-
senting an ever larger fraction of the global population, it has become steadily 
more connected. The average distance in 2008 was 5.28 hops, while now it 
is 4.74.”xvi

Bottlenecks
245
We can finally say with confidence that there is unlikely to be much more 
than six degrees of separation connecting everyone on Earth. The world’s 
foremost mathematicians and the world’s largest digitized social networks 
converge on the same truth. A shockingly low number of acquaintances con-
nects us all.
■
■Key Point  Your meme could be exposed to everyone on Earth, whether online or not, in as few 
as six degrees of recommendations.
So we give you the happiest possible bedtime story for an ardent innovator 
like yourself: it is mathematically and sociologically confirmed that you could 
invent a digital meme that spreads to 100% of the online population in the 
time it takes for six of us to make a recommendation. That absolutely could 
happen in less than an hour.
Why then, you ask, in the history of technology, have the fastest-spreading memes 
gotten to only 2 billion (out of 7) over a year or two? The main factor is our 
psychological receptivity to the acts of recommending and accepting the recom-
mendations of memes. Memes come in all the time, but as you’ve seen, most 
get bottlenecked. On that point, the Facebook and Windows Messenger studies 
we’ve reviewed only look at networks of attentional channels in which memes 
could be recommended, not necessarily instances in which memes actually were.
Before we accept that Facebook has shrunk the world from six degrees of 
separation to five or four,xvii we’d like to see more studies of networks of 
people who influenced each other to spread an actual invention. Milgram was 
clear, you would only “become a participant in the study by sending the docu-
ment on.” Acquaintance chains for him were comprised of people who would 
get a letter in the mail, actually read it, and actually send it on to someone 
who actually would too, despite how odd the letter appeared. Fully 22% of the 
chains were completed thus in his study, which Milgram viewed as a failure, 
although only 2% of the chains were completed in Watts’ email study. How 
many recommendation chains would be completed in a study of Facebook?
In short, we’d like to see more studies not of six degrees of separation, but 
six degrees of recommendation. By analogy, dropping the criteria that people 
influence each other might be about as undermining to this myth as drop-
ping the criteria that actors appear in the same movie as Kevin Bacon in the 
game “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.” Just driving by his house in Hollywood 
doesn’t count. Any tourist can do that. In network terms, your models can-
not just look at the presence of links (or edges), but they must account for 
the strength of those links and the receptivity thresholds of the nodes, and 
ultimately, networks in which a signal is known to have passed. The point 
is, relaxing the definition of an acquaintance might make the world more 

Chapter 23 | Six Degrees of Recommendation
246
connected only because the people are less so. If Milgram’s and Watts’ studies 
are still the best we have, let’s do better.
But the possibility of a total global cascade is there. Now it’s up to you to get 
to work to take advantage of it. Perhaps the rapidity and reach of “trending” 
memes will decrease in the manner of Moore’s law. Justin Bieber’s “Sorry” 
video reached 2 billion views far more quickly than Psy’s “Gangnam Style” did. 
Pokémon Go had a good run in 2016. But one day all that will be long ago, and 
perhaps, seemingly very slow. And perhaps there should be two awards given, 
the Dawkins award for the meme that spreads the fastest and the furthest, 
and the Maslow award for the top-trending meme that people, on some level, 
actually need (Chapter 13).
To get there, you’ll need to get serious about aligning your innovation with 
user psychology and increasing your memetic fitness and our receptivity. 
You’ll need to hire memetic engineers. The tantalizing truth of the small world 
is that global cascades are possible in theory, but still quite challenging in prac-
tice. Network science sets the stage, but psychology is still needed for you to 
see how the play ends.

Epilogue
You see now that it is our receptivity to your life’s work that matters greatly if 
you want your meme to be one of the few that enjoys a global viral cascade. 
With that established, you now see the true nature of our counsel in this 
book. What raises our receptivity? In our view, the answer is how well it aligns 
with the psychological bottlenecks of attention, perception, memory, disposi-
tion, motivation, and social influence. As Richard Dawkins, the sociobiologist 
who invented the word meme (see the Prologue) put it, “The survival value of 
[a] meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal.”
Our thesis began with the notion that many good memes fail that are worth 
spreading. In network terms, this implies your signal is strong enough, but it 
could still fail to meet our receptivity threshold unless it survives the bottle-
necks that we have discussed at length. You took the time to read this book 
not just to learn how to make a better meme, but also how to make us more 
receptive to memes that were already great.
Memetic engineering is the professional practice of improving memes to 
increase the likelihood that they will survive the bottlenecks of user psychol-
ogy. It’s taking action on the ideas in this book. It’s usability engineering and 
product design with theory. It’s a good day’s work and a very real way to make 
an impact.

Epilogue

How do you become a memetic engineer? If you are currently working as 
an analyst in user-, usability-, design-, or market-research, begin by producing 
a memetic fitness analysis. These should consist of just four slides with 
equal parts images and text:
	1.	 The current state of the meme—be it the interface, market 
positioning, or advertising message.
	2.	 The psychological bottleneck at play—a short summary, 
with images and citations, of the relevant psychological 
process influencing users’ receptivity to the meme. Many 
passages of this book were written specifically so that 
you could copy and paste them into a presentation.
	3.	 Your recommendation for change—how the meme could 
be changed to increase its memetic fitness.
	4.	 A predicted business outcome and a way to test it—a means 
of measuring the increased fitness you are predicting,  
ideally involving an experimental analysis of behavior.
If you successfully present just one such report, and it is acted upon, then you 
are a memetic engineer. You may then confidently list this as a skill on your 
résumé or LinkedIn profile. Don’t stop there, move on to the next meme.
What if you are not yet employed in such a capacity, but you want to be? 
Simple. Create the same four-slide presentation about a meme whose com-
pany you want to work for, upload it to SlideShare, and post a link in the 
Bottlenecks group on LinkedIn or our other community sites. We who are 
already memetic engineers will approve it for publication, and you may now 
interview as a memetic engineer.
Depending on which psychological process interests you most, you will be 
needed at different places in the tech world. To help you steer your career 
to the right technologies, the list in Table 1 indicates where the action lies for 
each psychological process.

Finally, you may decide that your contribution lies with memetic science, 
that is, continued academic research on the psychology and network diffu-
sion of digital innovations. There is great work happening, and indeed there is 
much yet to be done. If this is your path, we recommend adding a fifth slide to 
your memetic fitness analyses:
	5.	 Any modifications or caveats for the theory—whether and 
how the theory should be modified as revealed by the 
application to a specific digital environment.
Often, applying theory to a new arena lays bare the assumptions of the basic 
science, showing that while there may be internal validity to the processes 
proposed, it lacks external or ecological validity by failing to match the 
real world. These discrepancies are also perfect grist for conversation in our 
Bottlenecks communities. Are we able to multitask while driving? Is there in 
fact demand to rewatch movies? Does personality add to the accuracy of ad 
targeting? Does copy to dispel concerns increase conversion rates?
There are also more profound questions that only the most dedicated memetic 
scientists will be able answer. Are the memes on smartphones addictive, and 
if so, what is the most effective intervention? What population-wide changes 
in memory and retrieval can be expected with increased access to facts and 
knowledge via search? Does the uninhibited expression of polarized opinions 
contribute to a political and social coarsening of our culture? What effect will 
big data algorithms of behavior and their use have on our sense of self and our 
sense of privacy? How will aging populations attribute their challenges with 
digital memes, to their own impairments or to developers’ biases?
We, as users of digital media, have a keen interest in answers to all of these 
questions. We really need to see better alignment between technology and 
human nature. Thus in this piece, we took as our purpose to show specific 
instances where foundational theory could improve our experience, and in 
turn, the fitness of the memes. But this is no less true for the most intimate, 
immersive experiences (privacy, autonomy, independence, and fulfillment of 
the key goals of our life stage) as it is for granular experiences (a checkout 
flow on a web, or a relevant advertisement).
For this reason, the application of memetic science to real-world scenarios 
will both make your work important and also animate it. Social issues have 
breathed life into psychology almost since it began: Freud gained acceptance 
when he showed he could use talk-therapy to treat “shell shock” suffered 
by WW I soldiers (now called post-traumatic stress disorder). Memory and 
cognition were animated by industrial engineering. Social psychology sprung 
into life to explain Nazi Germany, and after that, to verify the assumptions of 
the Civil Rights movement (that separate could not be equal) and understand 
the resistance against it.

As of this writing, half of the humans on earth have internet access, and a third 
are connecting to others via social media. For us, it is already true that there is 
no digital life, there is just life. Technology needs psychology to be successful, 
but psychology also needs technology. The continued survival of the memes 
of psychological theory, a great body of knowledge and a profound episte-
mological tradition, is no less susceptible to memetic extinction than any-
thing else. The digitization of human intelligence and social life is the defining 
social issue of our time. Thus the memetic fitness of psychology itself will be 
increased only if students and scholars acknowledge and extend its relevance 
in technological innovation. This will not be the first time in earth’s evolution 
that a symbiosis is required for mutual survival.
We thank you so very much for your investment of attention; we look for-
ward to your next invention.
