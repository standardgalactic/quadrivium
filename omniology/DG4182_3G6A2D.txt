I would like to thank my colleagues William Irwin, Greg Bassham, Tom 
Concannon, and Gerardo Giordano; my former professors Ray Elugardo, 
Jim Hawthorne, and Brint Montgomery; and my Great Courses team Jessica 
Darago and Walter Jacob for their extremely valuable input on the lectures. 
I would also like to thank Ashley Panko, whose tireless proofreading efforts 
and skills in decoding voice recognition software errors cut my workload in 
half. I‚Äôd like to dedicate the course to my son Johney Davis Johnson, who 
was born in the midst of the course‚Äôs preparation‚Äîthree months premature 
because, apparently, he couldn‚Äôt wait to learn about the world. May you 
always have a curious mind, little Johney.

favorite bookstore, in philosophy, metaphysics is the study of 
reality. Originally, the word ‚Äúmetaphysics‚Äù referred to the works 
of Aristotle that you were supposed to read after his works on physics; in 
Aristotle‚Äôs MetaphysicsKHWDONVDERXWEHLQJDQG¬øUVWFDXVHV%XWQRZWKH
word refers to philosophical investigations regarding the nature of reality, 
including the nature of human beings, and the things that may lie beyond 
reality. The existence of God is obviously a metaphysical topic, but so are 
the essence of people and the nature of the human mind. And then there are 
questions about human free will. Can we really choose our destiny, or is 
everything that happens fated to happen?
But metaphysicians don‚Äôt always have their heads in the clouds. The nature 
of the universe itself, and the matter that makes it up, are also of prime 
importance to the metaphysician. Consequently, science will greatly inform 
our metaphysical investigations. Einstein‚Äôs general and special theories 
of relativity, along with quantum mechanics, reveal some very interesting 
things about the nature of the universe. 
And then there are questions that seem to be about both the universe itself 
and what‚Äôs beyond it‚Äîfor example, are there other universes? Is the reality 
we live in actually a multiverse? This may be true for multiple reasons, not 
the least of which is the notion that it‚Äôs much more likely than you think that 
we live in a computer simulation.

will begin by examining the nature of the human mind. We know it is related 
to the human brain, but how? Can the mind exist without the brain? How 
does the brain produce the mind? The course will then explore the essence 
of people. You are supposedly the same person over time; you now and your 
eight-year-old self are one and the same. But in virtue of what is this true? 

Scope
2
Your soul? Your memories? Having the same body? Exploring this question 
may reveal that people are nothing like you previously conceived; in fact, 
they may not exist at all. Unexpectedly, this will lead into a quick discussion 
about the nature of time, and then to exploring reasons that humans may not 
have free will. But ultimately, it all may be in vain‚Äîwe may not be free to 
believe that we‚Äôre not free.
The second half of the course will explore the nature of the universe and 
what may lie beyond it. This part of the course will begin with a quick primer 
on heavy metaphysical notions such as universals, particulars, and possible 
worlds. Then, the course will address the existence of God. What are people 
talking about when they talk about God? A perfect being? Is the concept of a 
SHUIHFWEHLQJHYHQORJLFDOO\FRQVLVWHQW"0LJKW*RG¬∂VPHUHGH¬øQLWLRQHQWDLO
that he or she exists? Does the existence of the universe point to the existence 
of a deity? How about the universe‚Äôs design? The course will explore these 
arguments in detail, identifying both their strengths and their weaknesses. 
The course will then explore the nature of the universe. First, you will learn 
about the basics of Einstein‚Äôs general and special theories of relativity, which 
suggest that the fabric of the universe‚Äîwhat Einstein called space-time‚Äî

we move through it? Is time travel possible? 
Next, you will learn about the discoveries of quantum mechanics to explore 
the nature of physical matter itself. You will discover that if you think you 
understand quantum mechanics, you probably don‚Äôt. But what you learn will 
force you to consider the possibility that there is more than one universe, and 
you will discover that quantum mechanics is not the only thing that suggests 
as much. In the conclusion of the course, you will discover that it is much 
more likely than you think that we live in a computer simulation.
Philosophy is one of the few disciplines where you can end up being less 
certain of things than when you began. In metaphysics, you can embrace 
answers if you‚Äôre willing to accept the consequences, but the best approach

may be to embrace the confusion‚Äîto simply seek an understanding of how

etaphysics is the study of the fundamental nature of reality‚Äîthe 
nature of the physical world itself and what might exist beyond it. 
Science informs metaphysical inquiry, and metaphysical questions 
are often about the discoveries and theories of science. We do metaphysics 
by examining our most fundamental assumptions about the way the world 
is, being open to the fact that we might be wrong and to changing our mind 
if we are. In addition, although it might be frustrating to study metaphysics 
because we so seldom get concrete answers, true wisdom can be found in 
understanding the problems and shortcomings of the proposed solutions and 
in admitting our own ignorance.
Metaphysics and Science
x
Metaphysics is the study of the fundamental nature of reality. It 
often concerns itself with things beyond the physical world, and 
persons and minds are often thought to be such things. And if God 
exists, at least as many conceive of him or her, he or she exists 
beyond the physical world‚Äîso, questions about God‚Äôs existence 
are metaphysical questions as well. 
x
But metaphysicians are also concerned with the nature of the 
physical world itself. In fact, science is relevant to metaphysics 
LQDQXPEHURIZD\V1RWRQO\GRVFLHQWL¬øFWKHRULHVOLNHTXDQWXP
mechanics raise interesting questions to ponder, but discoveries in 
neuroscience will also shed light on the philosophical problems 
surrounding the human mind. And what can be explained and what 
can‚Äôt be explained in physics may be relevant to whether or not 
God exists. 
x
Science is a method for discovering the truth about the way the 
world is‚Äîour most reliable method. It does so by formulating 
FRQ√ÄLFWLQJ K\SRWKHVHV GHULYLQJ SUHGLFWLRQV EDVHG RQ WKRVH
hypotheses, and then seeing which hypothesis is most fruitful‚Äîthat 

5
is, which hypothesis correctly predicts what happens in the physical 
world. Scientists will also favor a hypothesis if it has wide scope‚Äî
that is, if it has explanatory power. They will favor it if it is simple 
(it doesn‚Äôt require numerous assumptions or entities) and if it is 
FRQVHUYDWLYHLILWGRHVQ¬∂WFRQ√ÄLFWZLWKWKLQJVWKDWZHDOUHDG\NQRZ
to be true).
x
Like metaphysics, science is also a branch of philosophy. Science 
was originally called natural philosophy and became its own 
discipline when certain philosophers became concerned enough 
with certain problems, developed ways of studying them, and 
GLVFRYHUHG GH¬øQLWLYH DQVZHUV WR WKRVH TXHVWLRQV 7KLV QHZ
knowledge opened up whole new avenues of research, and a new 
discipline was born. 
x
This is why philosophy has an inaccurate reputation as a discipline 
that simply spends its time trying to answer unanswerable 
TXHVWLRQV3KLORVRSK\LQIDFWKDVDQVZHUHGPDQ\TXHVWLRQVLW¬∂VMXVW
that the answers it has discovered are so important that they give 
rise to the existence of their own disciplines, leaving philosophy 
and the philosophers that don‚Äôt enter that discipline with the rest of 
the questions that have yet to be answered.
x
We need metaphysics today because although science can get us 
very interesting measurements and results and produce interesting 
and fruitful theories, it can‚Äôt always identify the conceptual or 
philosophical problems that are raised by those results or that might 
exist in those theories. Sometimes we need metaphysics for that. 
Unfortunately, some scientists are hostile toward metaphysics, but 
good scientists recognize the need for it. 
How Do We Do Metaphysics?
x
To do metaphysics, we have to realize that even our most basic, 
fundamental, and cherished assumptions might be wrong. Our 
fundamental and cherished assumptions are the assumptions that 
we are least likely to examine on our own, so it shouldn‚Äôt be too 

6
Lecture 1: How to Explore Metaphysics
surprising that we would turn out to be wrong about something we 
haven‚Äôt thought that much about.
x
In doing metaphysics, when you realize that you‚Äôve been wrong, 
you have to be willing to admit it and change your mind‚Äî
otherwise, what‚Äôs the point? If you‚Äôre going to think long and hard 
about something to discover the truth, what good does it do you if 
you won‚Äôt embrace the truth once you‚Äôve found it?
x
There are also a few important lessons to keep in mind regarding 
how to do metaphysics. First, you have to understand the importance 
and the point of a thought experiment. When doing metaphysics, 
we will often consider hypothetical scenarios that are sometimes 
rather ridiculous‚Äîthat could never happen or at least will likely 
never happen in your lifetime. Thought experiments expose your 
intuitions and reveal your beliefs about certain topics; the fact that 
they would never happen is irrelevant.
x
When doing metaphysics, we must also realize that if an argument 
that supports a particular conclusion fails, that doesn‚Äôt mean that 
WKH FRQFOXVLRQ LV IDOVH¬≤LW MXVW PHDQV WKDW WKH DUJXPHQW GRHVQ¬∂W
HVWDEOLVKLWVFRQFOXVLRQ7KLVGRHVQ¬∂WPHDQWKDW\RXFDQEHMXVWL¬øHG
LQEHOLHYLQJZKDWHYHU\RXZDQWEXWMXVWNHHSLQPLQGWKDWRQHEDG
argument toward a conclusion doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the 
conclusion is false. 
x
Metaphysics can be a little frustrating. Because we are dealing with 
TXHVWLRQVWKDWFDQ¬∂WEHDQVZHUHGVFLHQWL¬øFDOO\¬≤DWOHDVWQRW\HW¬≤ZH
DUHJRLQJWR¬øQGYHU\IHZGH¬øQLWLYHDQVZHUV:HZLOOGLVFRYHUDQG
discuss a number of possible answers and theories, but most, if not 
DOORIWKHPZLOOEHVXEMHFWWRYHU\VHULRXVREMHFWLRQV7KLVFDQEHD
bit discouraging; you will wonder where the truth lies. But there are 
a few things to keep in mind that can alleviate such worries.
x
First, you should realize that this is a problem dealt with in all 
SKLORVRSK\2QFHSKLORVRSKLFDOSRQGHULQJUHVXOWVLQGH¬øQLWLYHUHDO
world answers, those answers spawn a new discipline‚Äîscience, 

7
math, theology, law, or another‚Äîleaving philosophers to deal with 
the remaining questions that have yet to be answered. 
x
In participating in metaphysics, and in philosophy in general, you 
are participating in a centuries-long pursuit of truth‚Äîone that has 
OHGWRMXVWDERXWHYHU\PDMRUOHDSIRUZDUGLQKXPDQSURJUHVV:H
DUHRQWKHIURQWLHURIKXPDQGLVFRYHU\VRZHVKRXOGEHDEOHWR¬øQG
satisfaction even in searching for answers that currently elude us.
x
Metaphysics can seem frustrating because it might seem that 
answers to metaphysical questions are unattainable, but many of 
the answers that we take for granted today were considered by the 
ancients to be unattainable: What causes the seasons? What is the 
Sun? What causes the weather? These were questions that seemed 
so unanswerable that the ancients simply invented myths to explain 
them. Whether or not the ancients took such stories literally, they 
would‚Äôve likely thought that pondering about what truly causes 
the seasons would be fruitless‚Äîas fruitless as ponderings about 
Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy that includes the study of the mind.

free will, the mind, and God seem to some today. But it would be 
premature to quit before we even try.
Assumptions and Questions
x
When it comes to unanswered metaphysical questions, something 
else that might feed our frustration is a faulty assumption about how 
many questions other disciplines answer. Metaphysics is not unique 
in being unable to give us ultimate answers to fundamental questions.
x
For example, although mathematics seems to give us very concrete 
knowledge, it‚Äôs not that concrete at all. All mathematical systems 
are based on axioms‚Äîunproven, unprovable assumptions. 
Mathematics is the process of discovering what follows from those 
assumptions. But it‚Äôs not like we know that those assumptions are 
WUXH:HMXVWDVVXPHWKH\DUHDQGZRUNIURPWKHUH%XWGLIIHUHQW
assumptions will entail different things and produce different 
mathematical systems, and there is no way to use mathematics itself 
to discover which, if any, of the systems actually describe the way 
the world is.
x
Another discipline that may seem concrete, but isn‚Äôt, is science. 
First, all reasoning in science is inductive: It uses a method of 
reasoning where an argument‚Äôs premises don‚Äôt guarantee its 
conclusion, but only make the conclusion likely. So, almost nothing 
in science is ever proven 100 percent; there is always the possibility 
WKDW HYHQ WKH PRVW KLJKO\ FRQ¬øUPHG WKHRU\ FRXOG WXUQ RXW WR 
be false. 
x

WKHRULHVHVSHFLDOO\WKRVHWKDWFDQQRWEHREVHUYDWLRQDOO\FRQ¬øUPHG
are merely instrumentally true. They are useful ways to describe the 
world, but they do not actually describe the way the world is.
x
Lastly, it‚Äôs not clear how much explaining science actually does. In 
DGGLWLRQVFLHQWL¬øFH[SODQDWLRQVFDQRQO\JRVRIDUHYHQWXDOO\\RX
JHWGRZQWRVRPHWKLQJWKDWLVD¬≥EUXWHIDFW¬¥,WMXVWLVWKHZD\LWLV

9
for no other reason than it is that way. And even if we do one day 
explain something that was once thought to be a brute fact, we will 
do so by simply appealing to a deeper brute fact. There will always 
EHVRPHWKLQJWKDWLVOHIWXQH[SODLQHGQRVFLHQWL¬øFH[SODQDWLRQZLOO
ever be ultimate. 
x
7KLVLVQRWDNQRFNDJDLQVWVFLHQFH¬≤IRUWKHVDPHUHDVRQVQR¬øHOG
of study will ever give us an ultimate explanation. Explanations will 
always bottom out in some brute fact, and where science bottoms 
out is pretty deep down. The fact that metaphysics does not give 
us ultimate, concrete answers and explanations does not make it 
different from other disciplines.

metaphysics will reveal the consequences of the answers that

learn about why the most common and supposedly easiest answers to these 
questions fall short. The easy answer to the metaphysical questions of the 
mind‚Äîthat souls exist‚Äîis a very problematic answer, and therefore, it is 
certainly worth considering other possible theories. 
'H¬øQLQJ7HUPVDQG3UREOHPV
x
The terms ‚Äúmind‚Äù and ‚Äúbrain‚Äù are often used interchangeably. This 
equivocation happens because of the known close relationship 
between the mind and brain. In metaphysics, the word ‚Äúbrain‚Äù is 
reserved for the physical organ‚Äîmade up of neurons, gray and 
white matter, axons and neurotransmitters, and glands‚Äîthat sits 
atop your spinal column. The word ‚Äúmind‚Äù is reserved for what 
contains, or is, your mental life‚Äîyour visual experiences, beliefs, 
decisions, personality, wants and desires, and emotions. These are 
mental things and, thus, constitute your mind.
x
One of the biggest questions in metaphysics is about the relationship 
between our minds and our brains. Philosophers call it the hard 
problem of consciousness because many think that it is unsolvable. 
The question essentially is this: How does the activity of the brain 
produce mental phenomena? It seems clear that there is a direct 
relation between brain activity and mental activity, but what exactly 
is that relationship? More precisely, how is it that the activity of the 
brain can produce mental phenomena? 
x

think that the soul hypothesis‚Äîthe idea that humans have souls‚Äî
holds the obvious and easy answer. However, and this is common in

when they talk about the soul. They‚Äôre not talking about someone‚Äôs 
personality, inner drive, or emotions. The human soul, as it is 
classically conceived, is something nonphysical. That is why it can 
have, or at least contain, things that have properties that no physical 
thing can have. Your soul is where your visual experiences occur, 
your personality is housed, your beliefs are had, your emotions 
are felt‚Äîbasically, any mental activity that occurs, occurs ‚Äúin‚Äù the 
soul. And because the soul is a nonphysical entity, it is not reliant 
upon the body for existence. The soul can exist without the body. 
x
Consequently, the soul hypothesis is often coupled with the notion 
WKDW RXU VRXO √ÄRDWV DZD\ IURP RXU ERGLHV ZKHQ ZH GLH 6RPH
believe that it becomes a ghost; others believe that it enters heaven. 
Basically, the idea is that your mind is a separable entity, made of a 
nonphysical substance, containing all of your mentality.

13
x
It‚Äôs important to realize that if the soul hypothesis turns out to be 
false, and the mind is not that kind of thing‚Äîthat mental activity is 
not contained in a nonphysical separable substance‚Äîthat doesn‚Äôt 
PHDQWKDWPLQGVGRQ¬∂WH[LVW,WMXVWPHDQVWKDWPLQGVDUHQ¬∂WWKHNLQG
of thing that the soul hypothesis suggests they are. And, although 
most philosophers today doubt the existence of souls, very few 
doubt the existence of minds.
Why Souls Don‚Äôt Exist
x
Initially, you might wonder why the existence of the soul even needs 
an argument. But while introspection does reveal the existence of 
one‚Äôs mind‚Äîit seems that there is not anything that you can be 
more certain of than the fact that you‚Äôre having experiences right 
now‚Äîyour introspection does not reveal that those experiences are

brain when you die.

with experiences and knowledge that they could only have if their 
VRXO√ÄRDWHGDZD\IURPWKHLUERG\ZKLOHWKH\ZHUHFOLQLFDOO\GHDG
The problem is that even if such experiences are not exaggerated 
or confabulated, there are much more likely explanations for such 
experiences than the soul hypothesis. 
x
But the main reason most philosophers think that the soul 
hypothesis fails to answer the questions about minds and brains is 
that it‚Äôs doubtful that souls actually exist. There are reasons, both 
SKLORVRSKLFDQGVFLHQWL¬øFWRGRXEWWKHH[LVWHQFHRIVRXOV
x
First, the philosophical arguments for the existence of the soul are 
poor. Although Plato presented arguments about the soul, the most 
famous arguments for the existence of the soul are given by the 
philosopher Ren√© Descartes. He essentially argues that the mind 
must be numerically distinct from the body and brain‚Äîliterally a 
GLIIHUHQWREMHFW¬≤DQGWKXVEHPDGHRIDVHSDUDWHVXEVWDQFH,QRWKHU
words, he argues that what we call ‚Äúmind‚Äù must actually be a soul. 
He presents three basic arguments, but each of his arguments fails.

14
Lecture 2: The Mystery of the Mind and the Soul
x
Of course, that there are no good arguments for the existence of 
the soul doesn‚Äôt 100 percent disprove the soul‚Äôs existence, but 
WKHLUIDLOXUHLVVWLOODPDMRUKXUGOHIRUVRXOEHOLHI:KHQLWFRPHV
to existential matters‚Äîmatters regarding whether or not something 
exists‚Äîthe burden to provide evidence and arguments is on the 
believer. Without evidence or a good argument, skepticism is the 
rational position. 
x
Furthermore, there are convincing philosophical arguments against 
the existence of the soul. Suppose that souls exist and that your soul 
decides to move your arm. Why does this cause your arm to move 
and not, for example, the person sitting next to you? The decision 
was made by your soul, but in virtue of what is that soul yours? In 
virtue of what is that soul connected to your body? 
x
It can‚Äôt be because it‚Äôs closer to it; souls are nonphysical and thus 
have no location in time or space. And even if we ignore that and 
say that somehow your soul is closer to your body, it‚Äôs still unclear 
how something that is nonphysical (like your soul) can move 
something that is physical (like your brain or body). 
x
The soul hypothesis is supposed to explain human behavior, 
but without a satisfactory account of soul-body interaction, this 
H[SODQDWLRQMXVWUDLVHVPRUHTXHVWLRQVWKDQLWDQVZHUV7KLVSUREOHP
of interaction has plagued dualists since at least Descartes‚Äôs time 
and has yet to receive a satisfactory answer.
x
In addition, even if we ignore this problem, the very concept of 
physical-nonphysical interaction raises other serious problems. A 
nonphysical entity like the soul reaching out and causing things 
in the physical world would violate three fundamental and well-
established physical laws: the law of conservation of energy, 
which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; the law of 
conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum 
of any system always remains constant; and the causal closure 
of the physical, which states that physical events can only have 
physical causes. These problems constitute what is considered to be

soul. Although not everything about how the brain works is fully 
understood, it is now undeniable that all mental activity is a direct 
result of brain activity. Everything that was once explained by 
the soul‚Äîemotions, language, decisions, sensation, memories, 
personality‚Äîis now explained by the activity of the brain, including 
activity in the limbic system, Broca‚Äôs and Wernicke‚Äôs areas, and the 
prefrontal cortex. There is nothing left for the classical soul to do 
and, thus, no reason to suppose that it exists.

There is no reason to suppose the existence of an extra substance to 
explain the behavior of our bodies when there is already a perfectly 
good explanation within what we already know exists: the brain 
and its neural activity. To do so is clearly and simply a desperate 
attempt to save the soul hypothesis from the evidence.

The implication that souls don‚Äôt exist might seem troublesome to 
some people. Often, people think that if souls don‚Äôt exist, then there 
is no God, all religion is false, we have no free will, and there is no 
afterlife. But none of this actually follows. 
x
First, souls have nothing to do with God‚Äôs existence. God can exist 
while souls don‚Äôt, and souls can exist while God doesn‚Äôt‚Äîthere is 
no real relationship between the two. In addition, soul belief is not 
as ubiquitous among religions as one might expect.

he inadequacy of the soul hypothesis made philosophers seek to 
¬øQG WKH PLQG LQ WKH PDWHULDO ZRUOG 7KH ¬øUVW VXJJHVWLRQ ORJLFDO
behaviorism, fell short but eventually led to identity theory‚Äîthe 
notion that mental events are identical to particular brain events. Identity 
theory seems right because it seems obviously true that mental events 
cause bodily movements, brain events cause bodily movements, and bodily 
movements don‚Äôt have two distinct causes. But it also seems to be that 
identity theory can‚Äôt be true because mental events and brain events each 
have properties that the other lacks, and two things can‚Äôt be identical if they 
don‚Äôt share all the same properties. 
Logical Behaviorism
x
The hard problem of consciousness is the question of how brain 
activity produces mental activity: How is it that mental activity 
emerges from brain activity? Thus, the hard question assumes that 
mental activity emerges from the brain and, therefore, is dependent 
on it. Because the soul hypothesis denies this by supposing that 
mental activity exists separately and independently of the brain, it 
cannot answer this question. 
x
Of course, if mental activity were not dependent on brain 
activity and did not arise from it, the hard problem wouldn‚Äôt 
really be a problem‚Äîour failure to answer that question would 
not be a concern. However, unfortunately for the soul defender, 
mental activity is, in fact, dependent on brain activity. So, the  
problem remains.
x
The fact that there were early attempts to develop theories of 
mind that answered these problems but didn‚Äôt succumb to the 
shortcomings of the soul hypothesis probably sounds strange to 
most modern ears. For example, logical behaviorism was a quite 
popular theory in the early 20th century. Behaviorism was motivated 

19
by a few things. First, because the idea that minds existed in a 
separable substance was so problematic, philosophers were highly 
PRWLYDWHGWR¬øQGVRPHWKLQJLQWKHZRUOGWKDWWKH\FRXOGSRLQWWR
and say, ‚ÄúThat is what the mind is.‚Äù
x
Second, logical positivism was very popular at the time. Logical 
positivism suggested that anything that could be true must be able 
WREHYHUL¬øHGDQGWKDWWKHPHDQLQJRIDSURSRVLWLRQOLWHUDOO\LVWKH
method by which you would verify whether or not the proposition 
is true. Because a person‚Äôs behavior was something in the world 
by which you could tell what mental state a person was in, logical 
behaviorists suggested that what it meant to say that someone was 
LQDPHQWDOVWDWHZDVMXVWWKDWKHRUVKHZDVSUHGLVSRVHGWREHKDYH
in a certain way. 
x
This theory was better than the soul hypothesis. It was simpler, and

LWYHU\TXLFNO\VXFFXPEHGWRPXOWLSOHREMHFWLRQV)LUVWSHRSOHFDQ
behave in a way that is consistent with being in a mental state but 
not actually be in that mental state. In addition, people can have a 
mental state but behave as if they do not. Behaviorism also can‚Äôt 
account for what mental states are like. Lastly, logical behaviorism 
is predicated on logical positivism, which was abandoned once it 
was realized that it was self-refuting. 
,GHQWLW\7KHRU\
x
The failure of logical behaviorism did not make philosophers 
UHWUHDWEDFNWRWKHVRXOK\SRWKHVLVWKHGHVLUHWR¬øQGWKHPLQGLQWKH
world was still very prevalent. As we continued to learn more about 
the brain, we realized that the reason that we have the behavioral 
dispositions that we do is because of our brain states. Our behavior 
is caused quite literally by events in our brain. So, a new theory 
emerged that held our mind states to be identical to our brain states: 
It was called identity theory.
x
We have learned that our behavioral dispositions are caused by 
our brain structure. To be disposed to behave a certain way is

came to learn that behavioral dispositions were certain kinds of 
brain events, it was quite natural to in turn claim that certain types 
of mental events are identical to certain types of mental events.
x
First, when an identity theorist says that mind and brain are identical, 
they are using the term ‚Äúidentical‚Äù in the most literal sense possible. 
Identity theorists suggest that minds are numerically identical‚Äî
PHDQLQJWKDWWKH\DUHRQHDQGWKHVDPHWKLQJ¬≤WREUDLQV7KH¬øUVW
identity theory was called type identity theory, which suggested 
that every type of mental event was identical to a certain type of  
brain event. 
x
Type identity theory has quite a few advantages. It coheres very 
nicely with what we know about how the brain works. It also avoids 
any problems of downward causation and, if true, completely solves 
the hard problem of consciousness. If mental events are identical 
to brain events, we need not explain how one can causally affect 
the other. The hard problem of consciousness is also dissolved; we 
need not explain how mental events emerge from brain events if 
indeed they are numerically identical.
x
Type identity theory ran into a problem, though, when we started 
thinking beyond ourselves. The way philosophers express the 
shortcoming is this: Type identity theory doesn‚Äôt seem to account 
for multiple realizability; that is, it doesn‚Äôt allow for the possibility 
of beings without brains like ours to be in mental states like ours. 
It seems that pain is multiply realizable; many different types of 
things can be in pain, and pain can be produced by different kinds 
of systems. So, if identity theory is going to survive, it needs to 
allow for multiple realizability.
x
It is for this reason that token identity theory was developed. A 
token is a particular instance of a kind of thing. A pencil is a kind of 
thing, but the pencil in your hand is a token‚Äîa particular instance 

21
of that kind of thing. Token identity theory suggests that particular 
instances of mental events are identical to particular instances of 
brain events. So, your particular mental events are identical to 
particular brain events in your skull. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that 
anything that is having the same type of mental events that you 
are has to have the same type of brain you do. In this way, token 
identity theory allows for multiple realizability, and yet is able to 
maintain that brain events are identical to mental events.

materialist theories, because they suggest that the mind can

the argument for materialism, identity theory still faces some

x
If brain events and mental events are numerically identical‚Äîif 
they are one and the same thing‚Äîthen they must share all the same 
properties. One can‚Äôt have a property that the other lacks, and it 
certainly can‚Äôt be the case that one possesses a property that the 
other can‚Äôt have. However, this is exactly what seems to be the case. 
x
For example, location is not a property that a mental event like a 
belief or desire can have. However, every brain event does have 
DORFDWLRQ¬≤LWRFFXUVLQDYHU\VSHFL¬øFVSRWLQVLGH\RXUVNXOO6R
brain events have a property that many mental event events lack: 
location. We could say the same thing about other properties that 
brain events seem to have that mental events lack, including mass. 
Thus, it seems that brain events and mental events cannot be 
numerically identical.

brain events. This is a pretty serious problem for identity theory, 
and no satisfactory solution to it has ever been offered. 
x
But there‚Äôs another question that has to be answered by identity 
theorists: Token identity theory suggests that particular tokens of 
mental events are identical to particular tokens of brain events, and 
it leaves open the possibility of the same type of brain events being 
identical to other types of brain events. 
x
But what are the criteria for identity? What does it take for a mental 
event to be identical to a brain event? Consciousness does not 
accompany all brain events; in fact, most of what our brain does 
is unconscious. So, in virtue of what is a mental event identical to 
a brain event? And how could we tell what mental events a brain 
event is identical to? Although there is not one single answer to this 
question, there is a very popular answer: functionalism.

oken identity theory suggests that particular instances of mental 
events are identical to particular instances of brain events. However, 
token identity theory leaves open the possibility of multiple 
realizability: Different kinds of brains can have the same kinds of minds. So, 
which brain events are identical to mental events? And in virtue of what does 
that identity hold? The most common answers to these questions are found in 
functionalism, which is a favored theory of identity theorists for what makes 
a mental event identical to a brain event. Understanding functionalism is 
imperative to understanding philosophy of mind and leads us to considering 
other theories of mind.

mental states does would have to be that mental state.
x
Think again about token identity theory. Functionalism can help us 
identify which brain states mental states are identical to. Another 
reason the token identity theorists like functionalism is it allows 
them to preserve their intuitions about the identity of mind and 
brain. Recall that it suggests that even though the same type of 
mental state can be instantiated by different types of brains, each

Computers are consistently becoming more sophisticated. Not

language in almost the same way we do. It will only be a matter of 
time before they are behaving completely like we do.

beings, such creatures, are minded? This is an important question, 
and it may be one of the most important questions that humanity 
ever considers.
x
The functionalist would of course say that they are minded. 
Because they behave like we do, they must have minds like we do. 
Essentially, the functionalist suggests that minds are like programs,

IBM computer, a mind can run on either a biological or a computer-

program be minded?

x
Alan Turing was one of the earliest functionalists and suggested 
something that came to be known as the Turing test to determine 
whether a computer could understand language. He suggested 
taking a human being and a computer programmed to have a 
conversation and communicating with both by typing‚Äîlike an 
instant messaging program. If you couldn‚Äôt tell the difference 
between the responses given by the human and the responses given 
by the computer, then the computer would be said to have passed 
the Turing test, and according to Turing, this would mean that the 
computer genuinely understands language.
x
We have yet to program a computer that can pass the Turing 
test, and a number of attempts have been made. One of the most 
famous programs is named Eliza. But the question remains: If 
and when we do have such a program, will a computer running it  
understand language?

Regardless of how we do it, once we develop androids, the questions 
surrounding whether they are minded and how we should treat them 
will be some of the most important questions humanity has ever 
considered. Think about how people will want to use androids and 
treat them. They can do our dirty work, including clean our houses,

only if they are not minded. But if they do have minds‚Äîthat is, if 
they feel pain, have emotions, etc.‚Äîthen it would seem grotesquely 
immoral to force them to do our dirty work. 
7KH0LQGHGQHVVRI$QGURLGV
x
Whether androids are minded will likely one day be one of the most 
important questions humanity has ever considered. So, how should 
we answer this question? First, let‚Äôs consider reasons for thinking 
that androids would not be minded. One might argue that because 
they are programmed by us they can‚Äôt have a mind, but there 
are a few things wrong with this reasoning. An android need not 
necessarily be programmed by us. It might be based on an existing 
KXPDQQHXUDOFRQ¬øJXUDWLRQEXWLWVQHXUDOFRQ¬øJXUDWLRQPD\EHLWV
own‚Äîreached as a result of its own experiences with the world.
x
Second, it‚Äôs unclear why being programmed would somehow 
restrict consciousness; it‚Äôs unclear why not being programmed is 
required if a being is to be minded. Ultimately, we think that we are 
minded beings because of how our brains function. That someone 
HOVHSURJUDPPHGKRZ\RXUQHXURQVDUHZLUHGDQG¬øUHZRXOGOLNHO\
interfere with your free will, but it wouldn‚Äôt mean that you don‚Äôt 
have a mind. For the same reason, it would seem odd to conclude 
that an android is not minded merely because it is programmed.
x
Probably the most obvious argument against the mindedness of 
androids is that mere functional equivalence is not enough to 
produce a mind. In order for a brain to have a mind, it has to be made 
of the right kind of stuff‚Äîthe kind of stuff that can mentate. But the 
problem with this argument is that it does not lay down any criteria 
IRUGHWHUPLQLQJZKDWLVQHFHVVDU\DQGVXI¬øFLHQWIRUPHQWDWLRQ,W
gives a few examples of what won‚Äôt work‚Äîincluding a pipe-and-
valve system, or even rolls of toilet paper, that replicate the brain‚Äôs 
function‚Äîbut this doesn‚Äôt really tell us much. Such systems may 
be logically possible, but they are not in reality physically possible. 
x
So, what is required? What kinds of substances can mentate? The

androids would be minded. Because they behave like us, clearly 
the silicon out of which their brains are made is a material that can 
replicate the functioning of the human brain. 
x
One can still insist that silicon brains don‚Äôt have what it takes to 
mentate, but the problem is that it‚Äôs completely unclear what 
grounds such a suggestion would even be based on. We have no

So, taking certain advancements in science as a model, some 
philosophers have suggested that the reason the philosophical questions 
about the mind that we have been considering are so elusive is because they 
are bad questions to begin with‚Äîbecause, they suggest, minds don‚Äôt exist.

accounted for. 
Eliminativism
x
Eliminative materialists suggest that we no longer need to 
hypothesize the existence of minds to account for human behavior. 
Explanations for why we do what we do can now be had solely 
by referring to the activity of our brains. So, because minds are no 
longer needed to explain anything, we should eliminate them. 
x
We should also no longer talk as if minds exist and as if they 
causally affect the world. We should no longer think that people 
do things because they have certain beliefs, desires, or experiences. 
Eliminative materialists call such talk ‚Äúfolk psychology,‚Äù and they 
think it should be eliminated. 
x
Embracing eliminative materialism has a lot of philosophical 
advantages. First, it is quite simple. The fewer assumptions that a 
theory makes, the fewer number of entities it requires to be true, the 
simpler it is. Because eliminative materialism eliminates the mind, 
and all other theories suggest that minds exist, it is simpler. And 
simplicity is a virtue in both science and philosophy. 
x
Eliminative materialism also explains quite nicely why all the 
other theories of mind, including those we have yet to consider, are

eliminates the hard problem of consciousness. If there is no mental 
activity, there is nothing to account for. In addition, because it 
eliminates the mind, eliminative materialism does not suffer from 
any of the problems that have plagued the other theories we have 
considered so far.

eliminative materialism, some more successful than others. 
8OWLPDWHO\WKHPRVWREYLRXVDQGVXFFHVVIXOREMHFWLRQWRHOLPLQDWLYH
materialism is this: The existence of the mind seems undeniable to 
most people. Eliminative materialists are suggesting that you have 
no mind. So, you are not having experiences right now. All that is 
happening are events in your brain. 
x
This seems obviously false. Eliminative materialists are denying 
the existence of something that we seem to have direct awareness 
of: our minds. In fact, many philosophers have argued that the 
only thing that people actually do know for sure is that they have 
a mind‚Äîthat they are having experiences. You might be trapped in 
a computer simulation and the world might not be real, but you are 
still experiencing what the computer simulation is feeding you. 
x
Even though eliminative materialism is great as philosophical 
WKHRULHV JR¬≤LW¬∂V QLFH DQG VLPSOH DQG DYRLGV WKH REMHFWLRQV WKDW
plague the other theories‚Äîeliminative materialism is one of the 
most unintuitive theories that exist in all of philosophy. 
x
The eliminativist will point out that our intuitions, and even our 
introspection, are not always reliable; in fact, they very often lead 
us astray. For example, people will often think that they are in 
love when they are not. Eliminative materialists suggest that the 
existence of minds might be like this as well.

to swallow; they can‚Äôt deny that their own mind exists. If you are 
like them, don‚Äôt fear‚Äîthere are more alternatives.
Property Dualism
x
Property dualists, recognizing the problems faced by the soul 
hypothesis and the suggestion that minds are made up of a separate 
substance, suggest that minds are made up of a different kind of 
property. They believe that there is only one kind of substance: 
matter‚Äîthe material that makes up the physical world. But they 
think that substance has two different kinds of properties: physical 
properties, such as location, mass, and charge; and mental properties 
(qualia), such as the ‚Äúaboutness‚Äù that a belief has, the intentionality 
that a decision has, and the redness that a visual sensation has. The 
mind consists of the collection of these properties.
x
A few property dualists called panpsychists think that all material 
in the universe has some degree of mentality‚Äîeven atoms have 
mental properties to some degree. But most suggest that it is 
RQO\ZKHQDEUDLQEHFRPHVVXI¬øFLHQWO\FRPSOH[WKDWVXFKPHQWDO
properties exist. Property dualists suggest that these properties are 
emergent nonreductive properties.
x
An emergent property is a property that is had by a whole that is 
not had by its parts. For example, think again about the heaviness 
of a car. Being heavy is not a property that the individual atoms 
of the car possess, but it is a property of the car itself. Therefore, 
heaviness is an emergent property. 
x
A reductive property is a property had by a whole that can be 
explained in virtue of the properties of its parts. For example, you 
can explain the heaviness of the car by referring to the mass of its 
individual atoms. 
x
Property dualists suggest that you cannot explain mental properties 
in this way‚Äîthey are nonreductive. So, the existence and powers of 
mental properties cannot be explained in terms of or with reference 

35
to physical brain events. Their existence is dependent on brain 
events, because they are a property of physical matter that makes up 
the brain, but mental properties are not reducible. 
x
Property dualists believe that these mental properties have causal

they did not exist. In this way, property dualists are able to preserve 
WKHLQWXLWLRQWKDWWKHPLQGKDVFDXVDOHI¬øFDF\
x
Of course, the hard problem of consciousness is still left 
unanswered; one wonders why nonreducible mental properties 
HPHUJH IURP VXI¬øFLHQWO\ FRPSOH[ EUDLQ VWUXFWXUHV 7KH SURSHUW\
dualists have an answer to this question: They suggest that we

It doesn‚Äôt deny that the mind exists like eliminative materialism. 
Also, because it doesn‚Äôt suggest that minds are identical to brains, 
but maintains that physical and mental properties are different, it 
does not need to account for how they can be identical yet have 
different properties. It also has numerous advantages. It doesn‚Äôt 
contradict neuroscience, like the soul hypothesis, because it admits 
that the mind is dependent on the brain. It also preserves the notion

Lecture 5: Alternative Theories of Mind
Epiphenomenalism
x
The problems that property dualism has accounting for mental 
causation can be avoided by embracing a somewhat similar theory 
called epiphenomenalism, which suggests that the mind does emerge 
IURP EUDLQ DFWLYLW\ MXVW OLNH SURSHUW\ GXDOLVWV ,Q IDFW WKH EHVW
candidate for the kind of brain events that mental phenomena emerge 
from are those that function the way that functionalism suggests. So, 
epiphenomenalism is compatible with many other theories.
x
However, epiphenomenalists suggest that the mind doesn‚Äôt 
do anything; it has no causal powers. Minds are what some 
philosophers have dubbed ‚Äúcausal danglers‚Äù‚Äîthings that exist but 
don‚Äôt have any effect on the way the world goes or what bodies do.
x
Epiphenomenalism has many of the same advantages as property 
dualism. It doesn‚Äôt deny the existence of minds, it can account for 
qualia, and it coheres with what neuroscience has demonstrated is 
true: The mind‚Äôs existence is directly dependent on the existence of 
the brain.
x
,WDOVRDYRLGVDOOWKHREMHFWLRQVWKDWDUHOHYHOHGDJDLQVWWKHRWKHU
nonmaterialist theories. Because it suggests that minds have no 
causal powers, it does not need to account for downward causation 
RUH[SODLQDZD\KRZPHQWDOHI¬øFDF\YLRODWHVNQRZQSK\VLFDOODZV
It seems to have all the advantages of both the materialist theories 
and the nonmaterialist theories. 
x
However, there is one big exception: It denies that minds have 
causal powers. The intuitive force of the notion that minds have 
causal powers is very strong. A husband‚Äôs love for his wife makes 
him kiss her on the cheek; it seems to be a fact that the husband‚Äôs 
mental events have a direct causal effect on the way he behaves. 
And if it does, epiphenomenalism can‚Äôt be true.
x
Epiphenomenalists will insist that seeming fact is an illusion, one 
SURSDJDWHGE\ORJLFDOO\IDOODFLRXVWKLQNLQJ6SHFL¬øFDOO\WKH\ZLOO
say that the intuition that mental events cause our behavior invokes 

37
the causal fallacy. The causal fallacy comes in many different 
varieties, but the most well-known one fallaciously reasons that 
correlation necessarily entails causation. It does not. The fact 
that two events are correlated does not mean that one causes the 
other. The correlation may be a coincidence, or the result of them 
both being caused by some third event and not directly causally 
related themselves. 
x
It might seem that mental events cause human behavior because 
they are closely correlated, but it does not follow from this that one 
causes the other. It might be that they are correlated simply because 
they are both caused by a common third event. And, in fact, this is 
exactly what the epiphenomenalists suggest.

too hard for you to swallow. After all, something that exists but 
doesn‚Äôt do anything would be a unique phenomenon indeed. If 
that‚Äôs the case, you are not alone. Many philosophers don‚Äôt like

over time. How is it that you now and your eight-year-old self are 
numerically the same person? You will also learn something that is common 
in metaphysics: The easy, obvious answer doesn‚Äôt work. Although the 
soul hypothesis is very popular, it falls drastically short as a metaphysical 
hypothesis and can‚Äôt account for personal identity over time.

The question of whether persons exist is not a question about the 
reality of the outside world. Instead, we are wondering whether

And for the sake of argument, we will grant the assumption that 
human bodies exist. The question is whether distinct entities called 
persons, connected to but above and beyond human bodies, exist.

that person‚Äôs existence‚Äîthe fact that persons are no longer where 
their dead body is shows this. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that the person 
can exist without a body; maybe having a body is necessary, or 
maybe not. But the point is that this is the concept of personhood 
SKLORVRSKHUVKDYHLQPLQG¬≤LW¬∂VDNLQGRIGLVFUHWHREMHFWWKDWZH
might say, exists in addition to a physical body but may or may not 
be dependent on it.
x
That persons exist, and that you are identical to your past self, 
is something that we will begin by assuming. But now that it is 
assumed, we will scrutinize those assumptions to determine whether 
or not they are true. The question we will consider is this: Assuming 
that you now and your eight-year-old self are the same person, in 
virtue of what is this true? What makes that identity hold?

Lecture 6: The Problem of Personal Identity

To get at exactly what this question is asking, philosophers often 
consider what is called the ship of Theseus thought experiment: 
Suppose that a man named Theseus owns a ship, and the ship is

the wood out of which the ship is constructed starts to rot away, 
piece by piece. So, the crew uses the wood from their used barrels 
of food to repair the ship, replacing one plank at a time and throwing 
the old, rotted planks overboard. 
x
,W¬∂VDORQJMRXUQH\DQGE\WKHWLPHWKH\UHDFKHGWKHLUGHVWLQDWLRQ
each original plank of wood has been thrown overboard and 
replaced with a plank of wood from one of the barrels. Is the ship 
that arrives at its destination point seven years later Theseus‚Äôs ship?

the award? If the ship returns to his home, can he truthfully claim 
it‚Äôs his ship? Or is it another ship, made out of barrels? If it is still 
Theseus‚Äôs ship, in virtue of what is it the same ship? Why is it the 
same ship?

eight-year-old self are the same person because they have the same 
body‚Äîthat is, because they are made of the same material. Just like 
the ship of Theseus, your parts are replaced over time as well. On 
average, about every seven years, your body is made of entirely new 
material. Just like the ship of Theseus, the material that makes you 
up is thrown out into the world and replaced with new material that 
you take on through ingestion‚Äînot unlike the barrels on Theseus‚Äôs 
ship. So, the question remains: In virtue of what are you and the 
VKLSRI7KHVHXVWKHVDPHREMHFWRYHUWLPH"
x
Figuring out the answer to this question is very important. Not only 
is our very concept of personhood up for grabs, but also only if 
we can make sense of personal identity over time can we hope to 
make sense of an afterlife. If you are to survive your death, some 
person that exists in heaven after your death has to be numerically 

41
identical to you‚Äîin the 
same way that you are 
numerically identical to 
your eight-year-old self. 
If not, then you didn‚Äôt 
really survive into the 
afterlife. If it turns out 
that 
what 
preserves 
personal 
identity 
is 
somehow 
irrevocably 
broken 
upon 
death, 
and thus no person 
in the afterlife could 
be identical to you, 
then survival into an 
afterlife is impossible. The same would follow if the very concept 
of personal survival over time, or even personhood, breaks down.
Revisiting the Soul Hypothesis
x
Probably the most common answer to the question of personal 
survival over time‚Äîwhy are you now and your eight-year-old self 
the same person?‚Äîis because you have the same soul. This is the 
classic Platonic concept that many non-metaphysicians embrace. 
x
A soul is a separate substance that contains our mentality. The 
soul hypothesis is the idea that our mind is a distinct entity that is 
separable from our body and brain. A common belief is that we each 
have a soul over the course of our life, and it is in virtue of having 
a soul that we are the same person over time, and when we die, our 
VRXO√ÄRDWVDZD\IURPRXUERG\DQGHQWHUVWKHDIWHUOLIH6RKRZ
is it that some person that exists in heaven after my death can be 
identical to you? Because that person has, or simply is, your soul.

Lecture 6: The Problem of Personal Identity
soul, it could not be in virtue of the fact that you have the same soul 
over time that you are the same person over time. This is true for 
three reasons.
x
First, if souls preserve personal identity, then they also preserve 
personal distinctiveness. In other words, the reason that two 
people are not the same person would have to be because they 
don‚Äôt have the same soul. But that means that their souls must be 
distinguishable; their souls can‚Äôt actually be numerically identical. 
But in virtue of what would they be different? 
x
The truth is that if souls exist, we know nothing about them, and we 
have no way to distinguish one soul from another. So, we can‚Äôt use 
souls to distinguish persons; explaining one thing with something 
else that itself needs explaining is not philosophically enlightening. 
x
Second, souls can preserve personal identity over time only if 
WKH\DUHVXI¬øFLHQWIRUSHUVRQDOVXUYLYDO,QRWKHUZRUGVVRXOVFDQ
account for personal survival only if having the same soul over time 
is enough to preserve personal identity. But it seems that this is not 
the case. 
x
Third, souls can preserve personal identity over time only if they are 
necessary for personal survival. In other words, souls can account 
for personal survival only if you must have the same soul over time 
to be the same person over time. But, again, this doesn‚Äôt seem to be 
the case.
x
The next time you‚Äôre sitting in a room with someone else, how 
do you know that you didn‚Äôt switch souls? We‚Äôre not talking 
about your soul leaving your body with all of your thoughts and 
memory and personality and placing it in someone else‚Äôs body‚Äî
and someone else‚Äôs soul doing the same thing to your body. If that 
KDSSHQHGLWZRXOGEHFOHDUWKDWLWKDGKDSSHQHG,QVWHDGZH¬∂UHMXVW
talking about the soul‚Äîthe substance that supposedly contains your 
memories and personality. 

43
x
If your mind was dumped into a new substance, and the substance 
that used to contain your mind went to someone else, how could 
you tell? What difference would it make? Because there is nothing 
to distinguish such substances, it seems that there would be no 
way to tell. It wouldn‚Äôt make any difference. For all we know, this 
happens all the time. And so there is no real reason to think that 
such a substance exists. 
x
It can be rational to believe that something that is unobservable 
exists. For example, scientists rationally believed in the existence 
of atoms (and their corresponding nucleus and electron shells) 
although they weren‚Äôt able to directly observe them or even have 
DQ\NLQGRIGLUHFWSK\VLFDOHYLGHQFHRIWKHPDW¬øUVW(YHQEHIRUH
they were observed, the existence of atoms explained many 
different phenomena in science that had no other good explanation. 
Explanatory power is very important, and the fact that a hypothesis 
offers up a good explanation is powerful evidence in its favor.
x
If the soul hypothesis were able to explain how we are the same 
person over time, then that would be powerful evidence in its favor. 
But unfortunately, the soul hypothesis cannot explain personal 
identity over time. Having the same soul is neither necessary nor 
VXI¬øFLHQW IRU SHUVRQDO VXUYLYDO DQG ZKDW ZRXOG GLVWLQJXLVK RQH
soul from another, and even what souls are made of, is a complete 
mystery. So, there is no reason to suppose that they exist‚Äîmuch 
less to think that they can provide an answer to our questions about 
personal identity over time.
x
In fact, so little is understood about the soul that relying on it as an 
explanation for personal survival is as bad as giving no explanation 
at all. The soul is an indescribable non-understood substance for 
which we have no evidence. Suggesting that it accounts for how we

Questions to Consider

45
Mind, Memory, and Psychological Continuity
Lecture 7
I
n this lecture, you will consider the preservation of one‚Äôs mind as a way 
to preserve personal identity over time. You will start by considering 
only the preservation of memory, but you will then turn to considering 
the preservation of one‚Äôs entire psychology. However, it turns out that both 
theories seem to fall short. Not only does a break in memory or psychological 
continuity not always result in a break in personal identity, but also by such 
criteria it is possible to have more than one of the same individual, which 
leads to logical contradiction.
Memory
x
One thought experiment philosophers often use to pull out our 
intuitions on personal identity over time is the transporter example. 
On Star Trek, they often travel by transporter: They step into a 
GHYLFHWKDWUHFRUGVWKHFRQ¬øJXUDWLRQRIDOOWKHDWRPVWKDWPDNHXS
their body and converts those atoms into energy. The device then 
moves that energy to a different location‚Äîusually an alien planet‚Äî
FRQYHUWVLWEDFNLQWRDWRPVDQGWKHQUHFRQ¬øJXUHVWKRVHDWRPVEDFN
LQWRWKHRULJLQDOFRQ¬øJXUDWLRQ
x
The resulting person is physically identical to the original that 
stepped into the transporter, all the way down to his or her neural 
structure. Consequently, this ‚Äúnew‚Äù person has the same memories, 
the same personality, the same wants and desires, and he or she 
knows the mission he or she was sent to the planet for‚Äîin other 
words, his or her entire mentality is identical to the mentality of the 
original person. Let‚Äôs call this material transportation. 
x
Once material transportation is complete, is the person that appears 
on the planet the same person, numerically, that stepped on the 
transporter pad? Suppose that Spock is the one beaming down. He 
steps on the transporter pad, disappears, and a person on the planet 
DSSHDUVZKRORRNVMXVWOLNH6SRFNLVORJLFDOMXVWOLNH6SRFNDQG

46
Lecture 7: Mind, Memory, and Psychological Continuity
has Spock‚Äôs beliefs, desires, memories, and personality. His body 
LVHYHQPDGHRIWKHVDPHPDWHULDOLW¬∂VMXVWEHHQGLVDVVHPEOHGDQG
reassembled. Is he Spock, or merely a duplicate of Spock? Did 
Spock transport himself to the planet, or did he die and create a 
replica of himself? Is the transporter really a transporter‚Äîor is it a 
suicide copy machine?
x
On the show, things didn‚Äôt always go as planned: The information 
DERXWWKHERG\¬∂VFRQ¬øJXUDWLRQZRXOGDUULYHEXWVRPHWKLQJZRXOG
disrupt the transfer of the original energy, and it would be lost. The 
Enterprise has plenty of energy to spare; they could take a new set of 
HQHUJ\FRQYHUWLWLQWRPDWWHUDQGFRQ¬øJXUHLWEDVHGRQWKHRULJLQDO
blueprint. Once again, the resulting person would be physically 
and mentally identical to the original. Let‚Äôs call this information 
transport. Would information transport preserve personal identity? 
If that happened to Spock as he was beaming back to the ship from 
the planet, did he really return to the ship, or did he die and merely 
a copy of him was created?
x
What your intuition tells you about how to answer these questions 
reveals your intuitions regarding what you think is required for the 
preservation of personal identity over time. The philosopher John 
Locke would think that in both examples‚Äîmaterial transport and 
information transport‚Äîpersonal identity was preserved. Why? 
Because Locke thought that memories are what preserve personal 
identity. 
x
The basic idea is this: It is because the person on the planet 
remembers everything that Spock does, including stepping onto the 
transporter pad, that the person on the planet is identical to Spock. 
And for the same reason, the person who returns to the Enterprise, 
even though he‚Äôs made up of different matter, is also identical to 
Spock‚Äîhe still shares all the same memories. And it is in virtue 
of the fact that you remember being your eight-year-old self that 
you now are numerically identical to your eight-year-old self. It is 
memories that preserve personal identity.

47
x
But there are a number of problems with Locke‚Äôs memory criterion. 
For one thing, if you happen to forget some part of your life, that 
doesn‚Äôt mean that you were numerically a different person during 
WKHWLPH\RXIRUJRW,QDGGLWLRQ\RXUPHPRU\KDVVLJQL¬øFDQWJDSV
in it. So, it doesn‚Äôt seem that memory really tracks personal identity 
in the direct corresponding way that it should.
x
$QRWKHU VLJQL¬øFDQW REMHFWLRQ WR WKH PHPRU\ FULWHULRQ LV WKDW LW
seems to be circular. Think about it this way: We know that your 
memories are encoded into the neural structure of your brain, but 
that means, at least conceptually speaking, that your memories 
could be implanted in someone else. All you have to do is arrange 
the necessary parts of their brain like yours. 
x
So, would getting someone else‚Äôs memories make you identical to 
that person? It seems not. Your memories belong to you; you don‚Äôt 
belong to your memories. It seems plainly obvious that someone 
could possess memories that are not their own. But if continuity of 
memories is what preserves personal identity, this is impossible‚Äî
you would be identical to any person whose memories you shared. 
x
To avoid this consequence, memory theorists suggest that the 
memory has to be genuine‚Äîit has to belong to you‚Äîin order to 
preserve personal identity. But now they are appealing to facts 
about personal identity in order to make sense of which memories 
belong to you when they were originally using memory to make 
sense of personal identity. We‚Äôre arguing in a circle.
Psychological Continuity
x
Memory is only one aspect of your mental life. You also have 
beliefs, desires, and a personality‚Äîan entire psychology. Perhaps 
it is the preservation of that psychology over time that preserves 
personal identity over time. 
x
We wouldn‚Äôt want to say that having the same psychology that 
you have right now is necessary for your eight-year-old self to be 
identical to you; the psychology that you had is remarkably different 

48
Lecture 7: Mind, Memory, and Psychological Continuity
than the one you have now. But from moment to moment, your 
psychological states are directly connected: The memories, beliefs, 
wants, desires, and personality you have at this moment are directly 
related, even causally related, to the ones you had a moment ago‚Äî
many of them are even the same. And those psychological states 
are related to the ones you had before that, and the day before, etc. 
There is a strong psychological connection between the temporally 
DGMDFHQWPRPHQWVRI\RXUOLIH
x
In virtue of this, there is a psychological continuity that runs 
throughout your entire life. Therefore, even though you now 
and your eight-year-old self are not directly psychologically 
connected, they are psychologically continuous. So, it is in virtue 
of psychological continuity that you are the same person over time. 
x
We probably want to add a little bit to our criteria of psychological 
continuity to avoid counterintuitive results revealed by thought 
experiments. For example, suppose that you went to bed tonight 
and died in your sleep. Suppose that at the same time that happened, 
RQWKHRWKHUVLGHRIWKHSODQHWVRPHRQHKLWKLVRUKHUKHDGLQMXVW
the right way so that it knocked him or her out, but when he or 
she came to, he or she had an entirely different psychology‚Äîa 
new personality, a new set of memories, beliefs, and desires. 
Everything about this person‚Äôs psychology changed. And suppose, 
by a complete coincidence, that his or her psychology was perfectly 
continuous with yours, including memories and personality. Again, 
the fact that this happened has nothing to do with the fact that you 
died and would have still happened had you not died. Would this 
person be numerically identical to you? Did this strange coincidence 
prevent your death?
x
Most philosophers think not. It seems that if some future person 
is going to be you, there has to be some kind of causal connection 
between you and that person. The reason that the future person has 
the psychology they have has to be in some sense brought about by 
the psychology that you now have. That they have a psychology 
continuous with yours can‚Äôt be a mere coincidence. 

49
x
So, very formally, we could put our psychological continuity 
criterion for personal identity over time like this: Psychological 
continuity exists between persons IFF (if and only if) there are 
overlapping chains of strong psychological connectedness, and 
those persons are numerically identical (they are one and the same 
person) IFF there is psychological continuity and that continuity is 
a result of a causal connection. 
x
Some might wonder if any kind of causal connection will do; after 
all, the causal connection that exists between your psychological 
states on a day-to-day basis is different than the causal connection 
that exists between, for example, the Spock that steps on the 
transporter pad and the one that appears on the planet.

ZKLFKLVQRWDQHQOLJKWHQLQJGH¬øQLWLRQ
x
For this reason, usually philosophers that defend the psychological 
continuity criterion think that any kind of causation will do; as 
long as it‚Äôs not a coincidence, identity is preserved. But despite 
the intuitiveness of this theory, it falls prey to some pretty

x
First, our intuitions about the survival of personal identity seem

survival than mere psychological continuity. Even if our psychology

criterion seems to fall short.
x
But maybe your intuitions about this are consistent. If so, your 
intuitions strongly align with the psychological continuity criterion.

The crux of the problem is this: Personal identity is unique; one and 
only one thing can be identical to you. However, it seems that more 
than one thing can be psychologically continuous with you. Thus, 
it seems that psychological continuity cannot account for personal 
identity; psychological continuity and personal identity are different 
kinds of relations.

Questions to Consider

51
Same Body, Same Brain, and Closest Continuer
Lecture 8
I
n this lecture, you will consider numerous theories that try to account 
for personal survival over time: psychological continuity, physical 
continuity, and the closest continuer view. They all fall short in one way 
or another. This might be for two reasons. The failure of these theories might 
suggest that persons don‚Äôt exist at all, so trying to identify what preserves 
personal survival is guaranteed to fail. Another possible reason is because 
we‚Äôve been looking at the question in the wrong way and thinking about 
persons in the wrong way. Maybe persons exist, but not like we think  
they do. 
Physical Continuity
x
Instead of psychological continuity, perhaps it‚Äôs physical continuity 
that matters for survival. Maybe it is in virtue of you and your eight-
year-old self having the same body that you are the same person. 
x
Merely having the same body over time won‚Äôt preserve personal 
identity. Technically, you do not have the same body that you did 
when you were eight years old. Over time, your body replaces its 
material with material that you ingest so that after roughly seven 
years, your body is made of completely new material.
x
But maybe we can reconceive what it means to have the same body. 
Your body replaces it cells and atoms with new material, but maybe 
that replacement happens gradually enough that we can still say it 
is the same body. So, maybe it is in virtue of you having the same 
body now as you had when you were eight years old that you now 
and your eight-year-old self are the same person.
x
But even if gradual replacement can preserve identity, there is still 
a problem. It doesn‚Äôt seem that the preservation of your entire body 
is what matters. Suppose that you lose a leg. Are you still the same 
person? Suppose that you have heart problems and someone donates 

52
Lecture 8: Same Body, Same Brain, and Closest Continuer
a heart to you. Are you still 
the same person? Suppose 
that one day in the future 
we perfect the full body 
transplant, where, if your 
body is damaged, we can 
take your brain and place 
it into a new body, saving 
your brain. Would you still 
be the same person? 
x
Depending 
on 
what 
kind of body you get, 
your 
personality 
might 
change‚Äîbut you would 
still be the same person. 
Because your brain is what realizes your psychology, it is the 
SK\VLFDOFRQWLQXLW\RI\RXUEUDLQVSHFL¬øFDOO\WKDWZRXOGVHHPWR
matter for survival.
x
But this is also a little shortsighted. After all, once you die, and your 
brain ceases to function, it still exists‚Äîthat piece of you in your 
corpse‚Äôs skull is physically continuous with the brain you had in 
life. But you no longer exist. If you think that the survival of your 
EUDLQLVZKDWSUHVHUYHVSHUVRQDOLGHQWLW\\RXGRQ¬∂WWKLQNLW¬∂VMXVWWKH
existence of your brain‚Äîit has to be functioning, too. So, perhaps 
it is the physical continuity of a functioning brain that preserves 
identity over time.
x
Recently, some people have taken to freezing themselves before 
death in the hope that one day medical science will develop a cure 
for what is killing them‚Äîand then they can be thawed out, cured, 
and sent on their way. We have yet to do this successfully, but if 
one day we do, the person who was thawed and cured will still be 
the same person who was dying and frozen. However, there was 
a period of time during which they had no functioning brain‚Äîthe 
physical continuity of their functioning brain was broken. So, we 
Are you still the same person over 
time‚Äîas your body and personality

Suppose that some person X right now has mental capacities. Some 
future person Y is identical to person X‚Äîin other words, X will 
survive into the future‚Äîif and only if three things are true: Person 
Y has to have mental capacities, the brain that realizes person Y‚Äôs 
mental capacities has to be physically continuous with the brain 
that realized person X‚Äôs mental capacities, and there has to have 
been no moment in time between the existence of person X and

A concept is vague when it is not always clear when something 
matches up with it. We can‚Äôt tolerate vagueness when we are 
dealing with numerical identity. Either something is the same 
REMHFWRULWLVQRW,QWKHVDPHZD\LWVHHPVWKDWHLWKHUVRPHIXWXUH
person is identical to you, or that person is not. Personal survival 
is not a vague notion; therefore, there must be a concrete answer 
to questions of personal survival. This means that our criterion of 
what accounts for personal survival cannot be vague‚Äîit cannot

We might try to combine a few views to arrive at a better criterion.

a role in preserving personal identity. This is perhaps the most

something like this problem.
7KH&ORVHVW&RQWLQXHU9LHZ
x
To deal with this problem and others like it, the philosopher Robert 
Nozick developed the closest continuer view. Our intuitions 
DERXWSHUVRQDOLGHQWLW\VHHPWRFRQ√ÄLFW1R]LFNDFFRXQWVIRUWKLV
intuition by suggesting that whether and in what body you survive 
is sensitive to context. Basically, you will always be the closest 
continuer‚Äîthat is, you will be the future person that is most similar 
to you right now. 
x
What does Nozick mean by similarity? In short, the person most 
similar to you is the one who shares the most psychological and 
physical continuity; although, Nozick puts more importance on 
psychological continuity.
x
So, of course, in everyday survival, you are the same person over 
time because there is only one obvious candidate; moment to 
moment, the person in your body is the closest continuer to the 
person that was in your body a moment ago. And the person you 
are now is identical to your eight-year-old self because you are your 
eight-year-old self‚Äôs closest continuer; no presently existing person 
has such a high degree of psychological and physical continuity 
with your eight-year-old self than you. 
x
The closest continuer theory gives intuitive answers to most of the 
WKRXJKWH[SHULPHQWVWKDWVXFKWKHRULHVDUHVXEMHFWHGWR:RXOG\RX
survive a brain transplant? Yes. Would you survive the extraction 
of half of your brain? Yes. Would Spock be the same person as he 
beams down to the planet? Yes. And if his signal were interrupted 
while beaming back to the ship, and the Enterprise had to use new 
matter to save him, he would still be Spock‚Äîthat is the closest 
existing continuer.

55
x
If you died and someone by pure coincidence awoke on the other 
side of the world with a new psychology that was completely 
continuous with yours, even though that is the closest continuer, 
Nozick wouldn‚Äôt say that is you‚Äîhe thinks that the continuation 
must have to have a causal component.
x
But the closest continuer view can successfully answer many 
thought experiment counterexamples that have been raised by 
philosophers against other theories. For example, what if you step 
in a transporter to Mars; it records your information, destroys your 
original body, and creates a new person on Mars with new material. 
That would be you, right? 
x
%XW VXSSRVH WKH WUDQVSRUWHU GLGQ¬∂W GHVWUR\ \RX¬≤LW MXVW UHFRUGV
your physical structure and sends that information to Mars, where 
a transporter there takes new existing matter and constructs a new 
body based on that structure. That person isn‚Äôt you, right? 
x
It seems not, but the only difference between the two stories 
is your destruction; there is psychological continuity in both. 
Some philosophers use this example to argue against the pure 
psychological criterion. 
x
However, Nozick‚Äôs closest continuer view gives us a nice answer 
to both cases. If your original body on Earth is destroyed, then 
the person on Mars is you because that‚Äôs the closest continuer. If 
your original body is not destroyed, then the person on Mars is not 
you, because the closest continuer is on Earth. That body is both 
psychologically and physically continuous with the original. 
x
But there is one counterexample that even Nozick himself admits 
his closest continuer theory can‚Äôt quite handle. According to 
Nozick, if you step in a transporter and your original matter is 
GHVWUR\HG EXW \RXU SK\VLFDO FRQ¬øJXUDWLRQ LV WUDQVPLWWHG WR 0DUV
and a psychologically identical person is created, that person on 
Mars is you‚Äîhe or she is the closest continuer. But if your matter is 
not destroyed, the person on Mars is not you‚Äîhe or she is merely a 

56
Lecture 8: Same Body, Same Brain, and Closest Continuer
duplicate. The person still standing in the transporter on Earth is the 
closest continuer.
x
Now suppose that the transporter on Earth doesn‚Äôt destroy your 
matter instantaneously, but the scanning process is such that it 
LQMXUHV\RXLQVRPHZD\HQWDLOLQJWKDWD\HDUODWHU\RXZLOOGLHRI
a heart attack. Is the person on Mars you? No, and even after you 
die, that person will still not be you; it‚Äôs not like your death would 
kill the person that now inhabits that body on Mars. The person on 
Earth is still the closest continuer. 
x
But what if you continue to live on Earth for only 1 hour? Would the 
person on Mars be you? Again, it seems not. But what if you only 
lived for 30 minutes, or 1 minute, or 1 second, or even 1 millisecond? 
If there is any overlap at all, where in the same moment there is a 
psychologically continuous person on Mars but a psychologically 
and physically continuous person on Earth, the transportation process 
does not preserve identity. But that seems rather odd‚Äîsurviving 
for 1 millisecond could mean that you don‚Äôt survive at all? You 
can imagine a very strange scenario where someone steps into a 
transporter on Earth and then says, ‚ÄúQuick, kill me, before the new 
person is constructed on Mars; otherwise, I might die.‚Äù

1. Nozick‚Äôs closest continuer view suggests that, like the survival of 
organizations, the survival of persons can be dependent on context‚Äî
on whether or not there is some other person that is a closer continuer. 
But there has to be a yes-or-no answer about whether or not a 
person survives. Must there be a yes-or-no answer about whether 
an organization survives? How might this affect the viability of 
Nozick‚Äôs theory?
2. How important is it to you that you are able to survive into the 
afterlife? The afterlife is supposed to be eternal, right? Even if it were 
utopia, wouldn‚Äôt you eventually get bored? Wouldn‚Äôt you eventually 
do everything there is to do so many times that you‚Äôd be sick of it? 
Wouldn‚Äôt an internal utopia eventually become hell?

hen it comes to the question of personal identity, the failure of 
many theories has led some philosophers to conclude that there 
are no persons. This theory has its merits, but it‚Äôs still a hard

which conceives of persons in a totally different way‚Äîas four-dimensional

truthfully say exists in the world is a metaphysical question, and 
many philosophers give a very simple answer to it: All that exists

persons. Persons don‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs not that there is not a collection

Because persons don‚Äôt exist, there is no right or wrong answer.
x
You might think this no-person, or no-self, view is a crazy one, but 
the truth is that philosophers and religious icons have been telling 
us this for centuries. Philosophers that argue for the no-self theory, 
like James Giles, are quick to point out that the words ‚ÄúI,‚Äù ‚Äúyou,‚Äù 
‚Äúself,‚Äù and ‚Äúperson‚Äù are not meaningless or useless. This separates 
such philosophers from the eliminative materialists who thought 
that language about minds should be eliminated. 
x
Some might think that Descartes proved the existence of selves with 
his famous argument, ‚ÄúI think, therefore I am,‚Äù but many argue that 
all that follows from his premise is that thinking exists. And ‚Äúthere 
is thinking, therefore there are thoughts‚Äù does not demonstrate the 
existence of a separately existing person. 
x
The no-self theory makes great sense of why all of our other theories 
have failed to answer our question about the survival of persons over 
time: It was a bad question to begin with because persons‚Äîat least as 
WKH\DUHWUDGLWLRQDOO\FRQFHLYHGDVVLQJOHVXEMHFWVRIFRQVFLRXVQHVV¬≤
don‚Äôt exist. But despite the philosophical sense it makes, it still is 
a hard philosophical pill to swallow. Fortunately, we have one last 
theory to consider that also accounts for why our previous theories 
might have failed‚Äîwhy the question of personal identity is a bad 
question‚Äîand it doesn‚Äôt deny the existence of persons.

x
The time worm theory, developed by David Lewis, suggests that 
our questions about personal identity are bad not because persons 
don‚Äôt exist, but because we‚Äôve been conceiving of persons in the 
wrong way. Lewis suggests that we should have been conceiving 
RISHUVRQVOLNHWHOHYLVLRQVKRZV¬≤QRWDVWKUHHGLPHQVLRQDOREMHFWV
that exist at particular moments in time, but as four-dimensional

x
So, asking whether you now and your eight-year-old self are the 
same person is like asking if two episodes of a show are the same

HSLVRGHVWLPHVOLFHV$QGDSHUVRQMXVWLVDFROOHFWLRQRIWLPHVOLFHV
spread out over time: a time worm.
x
So, what we should be asking is in virtue of what do you now and 
your eight-year-old self belong to the same time worm? And we 
could answer this question in ways that we‚Äôve already suggested: 
by referring to a psychological or physical continuity that exists 
through the worm which you now and your eight-year-old self have 
in common.
x
The nice thing about Lewis‚Äôs theory is that it can answer almost 
all of the thought experiment counterexamples that we have 
considered. When Spock transports down to the planet, his personal 
identity is preserved‚Äîor, more precisely, the person slice that 
appears on the planet belongs to the same time worm as the person 
slice that stepped into the transporter. And the same thing is true 
even if, when Spock beams back up, the matter of his original 
body is lost and the Enterprise transporter has to create a new body  
for him.
x
So, persons are time worms, and time worms are sets of person time 
slices. But we have to be a little more precise, because anything can 
be a set. We could group together any person time slices we want‚Äî
some from you, some from a stranger‚Äîand call them a set. But that 

61
wouldn‚Äôt make them a time worm; that wouldn‚Äôt be a person. We 
need criteria that determine what can belong to a particular time 
worm that would be considered a person, and what can‚Äôt.

continuous slices that we could 
include to make the set larger.

But this is where Lewis runs into 
a bit of a problem. Consider an 
Alzheimer‚Äôs patient who goes 
completely senile in his last 
¬øYH \HDUV +H FDQ¬∂W UHPHPEHU
who he is, his family members, 
his

constitute his time worm? 
x
We could include every slice 
from his physical birth to his 
physical death, but that would 
LQFOXGH KLV ODVW ¬øYH \HDUV +LV
psychological continuity was so broken in those years that the 
psychological continuity of the entire set would be quite low‚Äîfor 
H[DPSOHSHUFHQW,IZHGRQ¬∂WLQFOXGHWKRVHODVW¬øYH\HDUVLQKLV
time worm, then you wouldn‚Äôt have the largest set possible, but it 
would be 100 percent psychologically continuous. 
x
So, what‚Äôs more important: maximal size or psychological 
continuity? When should we say this person died‚Äîwhen his body 
physically died, or when his mind ceased to exist? As a physicalist, 
Lewis would likely prefer the maximal set, so he would say that it 
If a man loses his mind before 
his death, should we say that he 
died when his body or his mind 
ceased to exist?

62
Lecture 9: The No-Self Theory and Time Worms
was when his physical body died. Lewis‚Äôs theory gives us no way 
to answer this question, so at best his theory is incomplete.
x
Lewis also would have a tough time accounting for how we should 
describe what could be considered spinoff persons. In television, a 
spinoff is a show that branches off from another show. For example, 
Frasier was a spinoff of Cheers. How should we divide up these 
television shows? Clearly, there are two sets, but do the episodes 
of the spinoff belong to the original series, or are they two entirely 
separate entities, with no overlap at all?
x
We might have to worry about these questions with persons in 
the near future. Suppose that one day you are cloned. Clearly, 
this creates a new time worm, but does that time worm share your 
original time slices from before you were cloned? Suppose that you 
are duplicated, creating a physically separate but psychologically 
continuous person‚Äîwould that person share your previous time 
slices? Again, although Lewis might prefer one answer over 
another, Lewis‚Äôs theory gives no way to answer these questions, 
and therefore seems inadequate.
x
But Lewis‚Äôs theory also has a few other unintuitive consequences. 
For example, how many persons are in your house right now? 
Regardless of how many bodies there actually are, if Lewis is right, 
then everyone should answer this question in every circumstance 
with the same answer: zero. Persons do not exist at any particular 
location at any particular point in time‚Äîperson slices do. Persons 
DUHIRXUGLPHQVLRQDOREMHFWVVWUHWFKHGRXWRYHUWLPHWKH\FDQQRWEH
in a house at a particular time. So, the answer to how many people 
there are in any particular location will always be zero.
x
Lewis would probably argue that this is no more unintuitive than 
the realization that you can‚Äôt watch an entire television show by 
staring at your screen for one second. Persons, like shows, simply 
don‚Äôt exist in that way.

63
x
But Lewis‚Äôs theory also has this strange consequence: It seems to 
entail that persons don‚Äôt exist until they die. If persons are time 
worms, maximally large continuous sets of person slices, then they 
don‚Äôt exist until the set is complete‚Äîuntil it is fully maximal. But 
your time worm will not be complete until you die, so you won‚Äôt 
exist until you die.
x
Or, worse yet, you might never exist. Some philosophers think that 
all that truly exists is the present moment; the past did exist, and the 
future will exist, but neither currently exists. So, it‚Äôs never the case 
that anyone‚Äôs time worm actually fully exists in its entirety‚Äîso, at 
least in this view of time, persons never exist.

avid Lewis suggested that persons are time worms: Persons don‚Äôt 
exist at a particular moment in time, but instead as a collection of 
person slices stretched out over time. However, because your time 
worm won‚Äôt be complete until your life is over, this has the odd consequence 
of entailing that persons don‚Äôt exist until they die‚Äîthat is, unless you believe 
that the future events of your life exist before they occur. But how could that 
be true? And what could that even mean? This gives rise to questions about 
the very nature of time, and it is such questions that this lecture will address.
7KHRORJLFDO)DWDOLVP
x
A problem related to time that is important to theologians and 
philosophers of religion is the problem of human freedom and 
divine foreknowledge. In a nutshell, the problem is this: How is it 
that we can freely choose to do what we do if God knew beforehand 
that we were going to do it? 
x
It seems fairly intuitive that for you to freely choose to do some 
particular action, it must also be possible for you to not choose 
that action. If it‚Äôs not even possible for you to not, for example, eat 
pizza for lunch at noon tomorrow, then you can‚Äôt do it freely. This 
LVFDOOHGWKHOLEHUWDULDQGH¬øQLWLRQRIIUHHZLOO2IWHQLWLVH[SUHVVHG
like this: Free will requires alternate possibilities.
x
If God exists, he or she would supposedly be perfect‚Äîwhich means 
that he or she could never be wrong and would know everything, 
including what will happen before it happens. But suppose God 
believed yesterday that you would choose to have pizza at noon for 
lunch tomorrow. Would it be possible for you to not choose to have 
pizza at noon for lunch tomorrow? 
x
It doesn‚Äôt seem so. If you don‚Äôt choose to eat pizza, then you 
would make the belief that God had yesterday false, and that can‚Äôt 

65
happen‚ÄîGod can‚Äôt have false beliefs. The only way you could not 
choose to eat pizza would be by somehow changing the belief that 
God had yesterday. But you can‚Äôt do that either; you can‚Äôt change 
the past. Once something has occurred, it occurred. Once God has 
believed what he or she has believed, you can‚Äôt undo the fact that he 
or she believed it.
x
But if you can‚Äôt fail to choose pizza for lunch tomorrow, then you 
cannot do so freely. Free will requires alternate possibilities. So, it 
seems that the assumption that God has foreknowledge of the future 
is incompatible with the notion that humans have free will. That is 
the freedom and foreknowledge problem.
x
Divine foreknowledge is incompatible with human free will not 
because the existence of God‚Äôs foreknowledge somehow interferes 
with our ability to choose, but because the assumption that God has 
foreknowledge entails that the future must exist before it occurs‚Äîit 
must be there for God to know about‚Äîand if the future exists before 
it occurs, then we can‚Äôt be free. There are no other possibilities. In 
short, we can say that foreknowledge is incompatible with free will 
because it entails a temporal ontology‚Äîa view about which times 
exist‚Äîthat is incompatible with free will. 
x
This exposes why suggesting that God is timeless‚Äîthat God 
exists outside of the entire time line of past, present, and future 
and knows it as a whole‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt resolve the theological fatalism 
dilemma either. Suggesting that there is a time line for God to exist 
‚Äúoutside of‚Äù reinforces the idea that the entire time line, including 
the future, exists and thus reinforces the temporal ontology that is 
incompatible with free will. 
x
Some might try to avoid the problem by suggesting that the future 
is changeable. However, although this is a popular device in 
VFLHQFH¬øFWLRQPRYLHVWKHQRWLRQWKDWWKHIXWXUHLVFKDQJHDEOHLV
actually logically incoherent. It implies that it was true that some 
future event was going to occur, but you did something and now it  
won‚Äôt occur. 

66
Lecture 10: The Nature of Truth and Time
x
So, God‚Äôs foreknowledge would entail a temporal ontology‚Äîa 
view of time‚Äîthat is incompatible with free will. To avoid this 
consequence, some philosophers, called open theists, have denied 
that God has foreknowledge; consequently, they can avoid being 
committed to this view of time. 
Logical Fatalism
x
What is time really like? What is the correct temporal ontology? Are 
there other reasons besides God‚Äôs foreknowledge to think that the 
future exists before it occurs? In fact, there is. Understanding why 
helps us understand the nature of time, and even the nature of truth, 
and what truly lies at the root of the freedom foreknowledge problem.
x
Take the following proposition: The bottle is on the table. What 
makes that proposition true? Its truth can‚Äôt be without explanation; 
there is a reason that proposition is true, rather than false. So, in 
virtue of what is that proposition true? The obvious answer is 
this: the bottle being on the table. There is a state of affairs in the 
world‚Äîan actual piece of the world‚Äîin which there is a bottle, and 
a table, and the bottle is on that table. That physical state of affairs 
in the world is what makes the proposition true. Philosophers would 
call that state of affairs the proposition‚Äôs truthmaker‚Äîit‚Äôs what 
makes the proposition true. 
x
This idea points to the nature of truth and is in line with the most 
well-accepted theory of truth: the correspondence theory, which 
states that propositions are true in virtue of their correspondence 
to the way the world is. Simply put, a proposition is true if it 
accurately describes the world. 
x
There actually are other theories of truth, but none are well 
accepted. Some have suggested that coherence can determine truth: 
If a set of propositions is coherent, then it is true. However, although 
FRKHUHQFHLVUHTXLUHGIRUWUXWKFRKHUHQFHLVQRWVXI¬øFLHQWIRUWUXWK
After all, The Lord of the Rings is a coherent story, but it is not 
true. Others have suggested that truth can be found in pragmatism: 
If something is useful, then it is true. However, again, this doesn‚Äôt 

67
seem right. Newton‚Äôs view of physics was very useful, but it was 
proven false by Einstein.
x
So, according to the correspondence theory of truth, the most 
popular and intuitive theory of truth, every proposition must have 
a truthmaker. But here‚Äôs an interesting question: What would be 
the truthmaker for a proposition about the past? For example, it is 
presently true that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth, so what makes 
the proposition ‚Äúdinosaurs once roamed the Earth‚Äù true? 
x
You might say that the dinosaur fossils we have found in the ground 
make it true, but that‚Äôs how we know that it is true‚Äîthat‚Äôs not what 
makes it true. Even if no dinosaurs ever died in a circumstance in 
which their bones would be fossilized, and thus we had no fossil 
record of them, it would still be true that dinosaurs once roamed the 
Earth. After all, you can‚Äôt make it true that an event never occurred 
by erasing all evidence of it. So, again, what is the truthmaker for 
that proposition about the past?
x
The most obvious answer is this: What makes it presently true 
that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth? The past event of dinosaurs 
roaming the Earth. But how can past events determine the truth-
Propositions about the past‚Äîfor example, about dinosaurs roaming the Earth‚Äî
presently have a truth-value.

Lecture 10: The Nature of Truth and Time
value of a proposition that is currently true? If the proposition 
were presently true, wouldn‚Äôt that event have to presently exist? A 
truthmaker can‚Äôt make something true unless it exists, right? After 
all, if we take the bottle off of the table, and thus the state of affairs 
of the bottle being on the table no longer exists, then it is no longer 
true that the bottle is on the table. 
x
So, if the past event of dinosaurs roaming the Earth is what makes 
it presently true that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth, then the past 
event of dinosaurs roaming the Earth must exist. It‚Äôs not presently 
occurring, but the events must in some sense exist. We have to 
include them in our temporal ontology. Otherwise, propositions 
about the past have no truthmaker.
x
But the exact same thing would follow about propositions regarding 
the future. Just like propositions about the past, propositions about 
the future also presently have a truth-value. Thus, we need presently 
existing truthmakers for them. But what else could serve as the 
truthmaker for a proposition about the future except the future 
event to which it refers? So, we must include the future in our 
temporal ontology, too. If it is true that you will eat pizza for lunch 
at noon tomorrow, then the event of you eating pizza for lunch at 
noon tomorrow must already exist‚Äîit must already be written on 
the time line. It‚Äôs not occurring, but it exists. 
x
And because a temporal ontology that includes an already existing 
future is incompatible with free will, the mere fact that there are true 
propositions about the future entails that we cannot be free. In fact, 
because it seems obvious that there are presently true propositions 
about the entire past and the entire future, even if we don‚Äôt know 
which ones are true or false, it seems that we are committed to 
believing that all moments in time exist. 
x
The fact that there are true propositions about the future is enough to 
threaten free will. And that means it‚Äôs not even God‚Äôs foreknowledge 
that is incompatible with free will; the mere possibility of God‚Äôs 
foreknowledge is incompatible with free will. Even if God didn‚Äôt 

69
exist, if there are truths about the future, then it would be possible 
for God to have foreknowledge if he or she existed‚Äîbut, of course, 
if there are true propositions about the future, we cannot be free.
Avoiding the Future
x
To get this problem and rescue human free will, it seems that 
we‚Äôre going to have to deny that there are truths about the future. 
The problem with this suggestion is that it denies one of the three 
fundamental axioms of logic, fundamental axioms that underline 
every branch of science, mathematics, and philosophy‚Äîbasically 
all of human knowledge. And that assumption is that every 
proposition has a truth-value. Every proposition is either true, or it‚Äôs 
false, in which case, its negation is true. And if you deny this rule, 
not only does all of logic and reasoning fall apart, but it also has 
really strange results. 
x
It seems obviously true‚Äîin fact, it must be true, because it‚Äôs a 
tautology‚Äîto say that either you will eat pizza for lunch tomorrow, 
or you won‚Äôt. Not only is it obviously true that if you do eat pizza 
tomorrow, it was true today that you would, but also it seems 
undeniably true that you either will or you won‚Äôt. 
x
But that it seems crazy doesn‚Äôt mean that some people haven‚Äôt tried 
to deny this fundamental axiom of logic. To do so, you would have 
to rewrite our entire logical system‚Äîrethink the very way that we 
reason. And this is exactly what some people have done. Many 
multivalued logics have been proposed, but none have been fully

if you embrace a multivalued logic, the notion of human free will 
still faces some grandiose threats.

Lecture 11: Libertarian Free Will
Libertarian Free Will
Lecture 11
I
n this lecture, you will learn how a certain view of time‚Äîa temporal 
ontology‚Äîthat includes an already written future threatens free will. 
Keep in mind that the kind of free will that we are talking about is 
not political freedom. We have more or less political freedom depending 
on what laws are on the book, but that kind of freedom is the concern of 
the political philosopher, not the metaphysician. The human free will that 
the metaphysician is concerned about is your ability to choose the actions  
you choose.

intuitions regarding what is required to possess it. For example, it 
seems clear that you cannot freely choose to do something if it is not 
possible for you to choose any other thing. The freedom to choose 
requires alternate possibilities. This intuition seems obvious given 
that this is the very assumption we make when we are deciding 
which choice to make. 
x
This is the libertarian requirement for free will. Again, don‚Äôt think 
RILWLQSROLWLFDOWHUPV,QPHWDSK\VLFVWKHOLEHUWDULDQGH¬øQLWLRQRI
freedom suggests that free will requires alternate possibilities. 
x
There is actually a wealth of literature on this topic, and the

terms of alternate choice. In order to freely choose to do something, 
it must be possible for you to not choose to do that thing.
x
We‚Äôve already considered one reason to think that we are not free‚Äî
that there are no alternate possibilities. If the future exists before it 
occurs, then the future is already written, and we can choose to do 
no other action besides those that are already written on the time

line. But maybe you are not impressed with this argument; maybe 
you‚Äôre willing to embrace multivalued logic. Still, there are other 
reasons for concluding that we don‚Äôt have free will.
Determinism and Randomness
x
A deterministic system is one in which all events that occur are 
dictated by the laws of physics, and what they entail must occur 
given a previous state of affairs. A billiard table is a deterministic 
system. Let‚Äôs say that you‚Äôve racked up the billiard balls, and you 
hit the cue ball toward them. What will happen next is completely 
and totally determined by the laws of physics; the velocity and spin 
of the ball, the location and mass of the other balls, and the size of 
the table all determine what will occur. In fact, if you knew all of 
this information, and were really good at math, you could actually

x
Looking at it, it would seem random, but it‚Äôs only because we can‚Äôt 
intuitively do such calculations by simply looking, and most of the 
nuanced information that would be required is not available to us. 
There are several reasons to think that we don‚Äôt actually have free will, even 
though we might feel like we do.

ball from the same location in exactly the same way, and you will 
get the same result.
x
The determinist is someone who believes that the universe is 
a deterministic system. Think of the universe‚Äôs fundamental 
particles‚Äîlike protons, electrons, and photons‚Äîas the billiard 
balls and the universe as a giant three-dimensional pool table on 
which these particles interact with each other. How these particles 
interact with one another is completely governed and determined 
by the laws of physics, and everything that happens in the universe 
LVXOWLPDWHO\MXVWWKHPRYHPHQWRIVXFKSDUWLFOHV
x
So, if we knew the location and velocity and spin of all the particles 
LQWKHXQLYHUVHULJKWQRZZHFRXOGMXVWGRWKHPDWKDQG¬øJXUHRXW
where all the particles will be in the next moment in time. We could 
¬øJXUHRXWWKHHQWLUHIXWXUH,QIDFWLIWKHXQLYHUVHLVGHWHUPLQLVWLFLI
we knew what the universe was like the moment after the big bang, 
ZHFRXOG¬øJXUHRXWWKHHQWLUHKLVWRU\RIWKHXQLYHUVH
x
To understand why and how this view of the universe threatens 
free will, you need to appreciate that you are made up of material 
particles‚Äîyour actions are the movements of matter in the universe. 
And you do not violate the physical laws. We could trace the causes 
of the movement of the particles of your brain all the way back to 
the big bang, but obviously, you had no control over what occurred 
then, so you have no control over what you do now.
x
Perhaps we can fully appreciate how a deterministic view of the 
universe threatens free will by realizing that if it is a deterministic 
system, it is repeatable. If you set things up exactly as they were 
VHWXSEHIRUH¬≤LIWKHELJEDQJKDSSHQHGDJDLQMXVWDVEHIRUH¬≤WKHQ
the universe would unfold exactly as it had before. So, clearly, 

75
nothing else but what is causally determined by the initial state of 
the universe, including your actions, could occur. So, clearly, you 
can‚Äôt do otherwise, and thus you are not free.
x
The deterministic view of the universe was very popular among 
scientists more than a century and a half ago, because it had the 
most evidence at the time. But it turns out that this view has faults. 
What proved determinism false was quantum mechanics. 
x
Random, uncaused events are no more free than determined 
ones. So, our current view of the universe as dictated by quantum

x
Ultimately, it seems that in order for you to have free will, your 
actions must be up to you. But they are not up to you if they are 
determined or if they are random. For this reason, a lot of people try 
to defend the soul hypothesis in order to defend the notion of free 
will. It seems that only if our soul is magically reaching out from 
beyond the physical world to determine what actions we take are 
we really free. But we‚Äôve already encountered the problems with 
the soul hypothesis. We know that all our mental events, including 
the decisions we make, are a result of the neural activity of  
our brains.

x
The second threat to free will is what we have learned from 
neuroscience. The human limbic system, the origin of all our 
emotions, is constantly sending signals to our frontal cortex, the 
rational decision centers of our brain, telling it what to do. The 
cortex can inhibit those signals to some degree, but the number 
of connections running from the limbic system to the cortex is far 
greater than the number of connections running back down from 
the cortex to the limbic system. There‚Äôs not much it can do. Mainly, 
what it does is follow the limbic system‚Äôs suggestions and then go 
through a process of rationalization to convince itself that is what it

But it‚Äôs not like the structure of our brain is within our control. Most 
of that structure is due to our genetics, and that is not within our 
control. But the rest of the structure is a result of our environment‚Äî
how we are taught, the things we experience, etc. And that‚Äôs not 
within our control either. 
x
You might think that we can control our environment by choosing

a result of our brain structure, which again is either a product of 
genetics or environment. Tracing it back, you will ultimately get 
to environments that you had no control over, like the environment 
\RX¬øQG\RXUVHOILQDVDEDE\DQG\RXZLOOUHDOL]H\RXDFWXDOO\
have no free will.
x
But maybe you think that the decision centers of our brain, the 
parts that actually give rise to the conscious experience of making a 
decision, can produce true free decisions‚Äîperhaps somehow their 
FRPSOH[LW\SUHVHUYHVIUHHZLOO%XWQHXURVFLHQFHKDVHYHQGH√ÄDWHG
that notion.
x
In the 1960s, the neuroscientists Hans Helmut Kornhuber and 
L√ºder Deecke discovered that if you measure brain activity before 
a decision occurs, you can actually see the processes that lead to 
the decision being made‚Äîand, it turns out, they happen before 
the decision is consciously made and have nothing to do with the 
part of the brain responsible for conscious decisions. They called 
LW D UHDGLQHVV SRWHQWLDO$QG VLQFH WKHQ WKHLU ¬øQGLQJV KDYH EHHQ
repeated, supported, and reiterated in many ways. 
x
Then, in 2008, psychologist John-Dylan Haynes performed an 
experiment in which people decided which button to push while 
watching a series of letters being displayed and reported what 
letter was displayed while making their decision. Haynes found 
that unconscious parts of the brain were busy doing their work to 
bring about the eventual action seconds before the reported letter 
appeared‚Äîlong before the conscious decision was made. In his 

77
own experiments, neuroscientist Itzhak Fried was even able to 
predict the conscious decision before it was made with 80 to 90 
percent accuracy.
x
Even if you are not bothered by determinism, or quantum 
randomness, or even that our actions are determined by the structure 
of our brain‚Äîif you think you are free‚Äîyou‚Äôve got to think that 
your conscious decisions play a causal role in the actions that you 
make. You‚Äôve got to think that when your free will is exercised, 
you are consciously making a decision‚Äîyour consciousness is 
involved in decision making. Even if you‚Äôre an epiphenomenalist 
and you don‚Äôt think that mental events have any causal effect on the 
world, you‚Äôve got to think that the part of your brain that gives rise 
to conscious decisions has to be the cause of your actions, at least if 
you‚Äôre going to be free. 
x
But what these experiments seem to indicate is that your conscious 
decision is an afterthought. The real decision process is done by 
unconscious parts of the brain, and once they have done their work, 
they send a signal to the consciousness-producing part of the brain 
that gives you the conscious experience of making the decision. But 
the brain activity that produces that experience, or the parts of the 
brain that produce them, are not playing a role in determining what 
action you will take. The brain is creating the illusion of free will. 
Ultimately, the results of these experiments are challenged by some 
scientists, and more experiments need to be done.

Compatibilistic Freedom
Lecture 12

ot only are certain temporal ontologies incompatible with free will, 
but the very nature of the universe seems to be as well. In addition, 
not only do our decisions seem to simply be a result of our brain 
VWUXFWXUHZKLFKLVRXWVLGHRIRXUFRQWUROEXWDOVRQHXURVFLHQWL¬øFUHVHDUFK
seems to suggest that our actions are actually brought about by unconscious 
processes in our brain that happen before our conscious decisions occur. 
But could it be that even though we don‚Äôt have libertarian free will, we are 
still free in another way‚Äîperhaps even a more important way? This is the 
suggestion of the compatibilists. 
&RPSDWLELOLVP
x
The reason that free will is usually thought to be of philosophical 
VLJQL¬øFDQFH LV EHFDXVH LW VHHPV WR EH UHTXLUHG IRU PRUDO
responsibility. You can only be morally responsible for doing 
something if you freely choose to do it. Libertarians suggest that 
free will requires alternate possibilities, but compatibilists suggest 
that this may not be the case because moral responsibility may not 
really require alternate possibilities. If freedom is required for moral 
responsibility, but moral responsibility doesn‚Äôt require alternate 
possibilities, then freedom doesn‚Äôt require alternate possibilities.
x
The compatibilists‚Äô notion of freedom doesn‚Äôt require alternate 
SRVVLELOLWLHV7KHEDVLFLGHDLVWKLV$VORQJDV\RXUDFWLRQV√ÄRZRXW
of your wants and desires, then you are said to be acting freely. If 
you want to do something, and your action of doing it is caused by 
your wanting to do it, then you are doing it freely‚Äîyou could be 
held morally responsible or praiseworthy for doing it. Notice that 
this can be true (you can act on your wants and desires) even if 
you couldn‚Äôt do or choose to do anything else. So, according to the 
compatibilists, you can be free and even morally responsible even if 
you can‚Äôt choose to do otherwise.

80
Lecture 12: Compatibilistic Freedom
x
For simplicity‚Äôs sake, let‚Äôs reserve the word ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù for the 
compatibilists‚Äô notion and the words ‚Äúfree will‚Äù for the libertarian 
notion. So, the compatibilists would admit that we humans don‚Äôt 
have free will‚Äîin the sense that we can do otherwise‚Äîbut humans 
do possess freedom: They can act according to their wants and 
desires and can be held morally responsible for doing so.
x
However, this articulation of what compatibilists say is required 
for freedom is a bit simplistic. After all, chain-smokers desire 
cigarettes, but when they smoke one, it‚Äôs not necessarily the case 
that they are acting freely. This has caused compatibilists to make 
IXUWKHUPRGL¬øFDWLRQVWRWKHLUWKHRU\
x
Chain-smokers may desire their next cigarette, but they also may 
desire to no longer have such desires. They may have second-order 
desires‚Äîdesires about their desires. Some compatibilists have 
suggested that we think of freedom 
in terms of acting in accordance 
with your second-order wants and 
desires. So, chain-smokers who 
want to quit don‚Äôt freely choose 
to smoke each cigarette because, 
even though they desire a cigarette, 
their action is not in line with their 
second-order desire to not want or 
smoke cigarettes anymore. But they 
can truly show that they are free by 
choosing not to smoke, despite their 
¬øUVWRUGHUGHVLUHWRGRVR
x
2WKHUFRPSDWLELOLVWVKDYHLGHQWL¬øHG
other components of our psychology 
that may drive our behavior and 
have argued that we possess freedom when we act in accordance 
with them. For example, John Martin Fischer has developed a

81
roughly put, if a decision is reached as a process of reasonable 
deliberation, the action is said to be free. 
x
7KHFRPSDWLELOLVWV¬∂GH¬øQLWLRQRIIUHHZLOOKDVPDQ\DGYDQWDJHVQRW
the least of which is that, unlike libertarian free will, a decent case 
can be made that humans actually possess this kind of freedom. For 
example, humans possessing this kind of freedom is compatible 
with determinism. In fact, that‚Äôs where compatibilism gets its name. 
Even if it is the case that every event in the universe is determined 
by prior causes, including all the events in your brain and your 
bodily actions, it can still be the case that you act in accordance with 
your wants and desires, or your second-order wants and desires. 
x
Or, it can still be the case that you do what you do as the result of 
a reasonable deliberation. You may have been determined by prior 
physical events in the universe to have the wants and desires you 
have, or even to go through the reasonable deliberation process 
that you did, but that doesn‚Äôt matter for the compatibilists. All that 
matters is what drives your actions; if they are appropriately driven, 
then they are free and you are morally responsible for them.
x
It‚Äôs less clear if and when compatibilism is consistent with 
indeterminism. If a random quantum event happens in your brain 
and causes you to have a certain desire, and then you act according 
to that desire, according to the compatibilists, you are free. You 
acted in accordance with your desire.

But if you do the action you do merely because a certain quantum 
event happens in your brain, then you‚Äôre not acting freely, according 
to the compatibilists. And this is true even if you happen to act in 
accordance with a desire that you happen to have. According to 
compatibilism, your actions have to be driven by your wants and

However, until more research on the brain determines the exact role

that seem to show that it is unconscious brain processes that cause

research and argument is needed.

means when they say that humans are free. When people believe 
that humans are free, they believe that, ultimately, how they behave 
is up to them. Nothing else is the cause of the agent‚Äôs action; the 
agent, himself or herself, is the ultimate cause.
x
This intuition has given rise to another libertarian theory of free 
will: agent-causation. The basic idea is that in order for an action 
to be free, the causal story of why the action occurred has to end in 
the agent that performed the action. Most agent-causation theorists 
think that if it is true that the agent is the ultimate cause of the 
action, then it must be possible for the agent to do otherwise. This is 
why agent theorists are libertarians. Notice that in a compatibilist‚Äôs 
GH¬øQLWLRQWKHDJHQWFRXOGIDLOWREHWKHXOWLPDWHFDXVHRIKLVRUKHU
actions and yet still possess freedom. 
x
It might seem outlandish for someone‚Äôs wants and desires to come 
from the outside, but if the universe is deterministic, then this would 
actually be quite common. The wants and desires you have are the 
result of your brain structure, and you really don‚Äôt have control over 
that. Your brain structure is a result of your DNA and environment, 
both of which are ultimately out of your control.
x
And this is true whether you think that freedom requires you to act 
because of second-order wants and desires or rational deliberation‚Äî
whatever it is, it will be the result of your neural structure. But, 
ultimately, your neural structure is beyond your control. We

when they believe that humans are free.
x
So, we have now considered three reasons for concluding that 
humans don‚Äôt possess free will: the problem of temporal ontology, 
the problem of determinism and indeterminism, and the problems 
presented by neuroscience. If compatibilists are right about what is 
required for humans to be free, these things may not pose that much

that humans don‚Äôt have free will would completely change our

x
However, the thing is that the admission might never come. Not 
only might the philosophical book on free will never be closed‚Äî
some philosophers still argue about it vehemently‚Äîbut even 
if it is philosophically undeniable that we do not possess free 
will, it seems unlikely that we will ever cease feeling free. The 
notion that we have free will is so ingrained in us that it seems 
that no philosophical argument could dislodge it, at least on a  
day-to-day basis.
x
We have no choice; we are not free. Ultimately, we do not have 
control of our actions, desires, or beliefs. And one thing we can‚Äôt 
help but believe is true is that we have free will. So, what‚Äôs the 
SRLQW RI WU\LQJ WR ¬øJXUH RXW ZKHWKHU RU QRW ZH KDYH IUHH ZLOO LI
we can‚Äôt help but believe that we do? The answer comes in our 
ability to separate personal feelings from academic philosophical 
conclusions, being able to separate what we know is true and 
what we feel is true, and being able to act accordingly in the  
relevant situations. 

84
Lecture 12: Compatibilistic Freedom
x
For example, once we academically realize that humans have no 
free will, we will have to repurpose our prison system. Regardless 
of how free we feel, and even how we feel about those who commit 
crimes, an argument that criminals freely choose to do their 
crimes, and are thus morally responsible, would have no legs to 
stand on. But the academic realization that we are not free in the 
metaphysical sense would not be a reason to restrict our freedom 
in the political sense‚Äîfor restricting liberty. Even if we can‚Äôt do 
otherwise, it doesn‚Äôt follow that we should be restricted by law 
from doing otherwise. 
x
The academic realization that there is no free will might be hard 
on religion. Religions usually assume that we are personally 
morally responsible for our actions and that we will somehow 
reap the rewards or punishments for our moral behavior. And, 
philosophically, that may not make much sense. On the other 
hand, the personal feeling of moral responsibility likely isn‚Äôt going 
anywhere‚Äîin the same way that our feeling that we are free isn‚Äôt

crazy; in fact, these concepts are very philosophically useful. 
Hume and Causation
x
What does it mean that to suggest that one thing, A, is the cause 
of some other thing B? You can‚Äôt merely mean that A comes right 
before B; there are plenty of examples of one thing following 
the other where the two things are not causally related. But even 
if there were a correlation, that would not necessarily imply a 
causal connection. 
x
The causal fallacy is a logical fallacy: Correlation does not 
necessarily imply causation. Sometimes the correlation is due not 
WRFDXVDWLRQEXWWRDFRPPRQWKLUGIDFWRU%XWVRPHWLPHVLW¬∂VMXVW
coincidence. So, when we say that two things are causally related, 
we can‚Äôt merely mean that one came before the other or that they 
are correlated. So, what does causation amount to?
x
The philosopher David Hume suggested that a causal relation 
between two things amounted to a necessary connection between 
those two things. The presence of one would guarantee the presence 
of the other. That would mean that not only is it the case that every 
time A has occurred B followed, but every time A will occur B  
will occur.
x
But how could we know that two events are necessarily connected 
in this way? A necessary connection is not a thing that we can 
observe; all we can see with our eyes is a correlation. We cannot 

87
look into the future to see whether or not every time A will occur B 
will occur.
x
You might think that we can know that B will always follow A 
because B always has followed A. However, Hume points out, such 
an inference relies on induction, a method of reasoning that infers 
what the future will be like from what the past was like. Hume 
points out that we cannot prove that such reasoning is reliable. Any 
argument we gave in its favor would have to utilize the fact that 
such reasoning has worked in the past and from that conclude that 
it will work in the future. But such an argument utilizes the very 
method of reasoning that it‚Äôs trying to prove and, thus, is no good. It

x
Statements about possibility and necessity are called modal 
statements. Their truth is controversial. Consider the following 
statement: Mitt Romney could have won the 2012 election. We 
think that this statement is true. We can no longer change the past, 
but the state of affairs of Romney winning the 2012 election is a 
possible state of affairs. But what makes that true?
x
The correspondence theory of truth requires the truth of propositions 
to have an explanation‚Äîto have a truthmaker. The fact that Barack 
Obama won the 2012 election does have a truthmaker: the past 
event of Obama winning the election. But what makes it true that 
Romney could have won the election? Because Romney did not 
win the election in the real world, it doesn‚Äôt seem that we can point 
WRDQ\VWDWHRIDIIDLUVLQWKHUHDOZRUOGWR¬øQGDWUXWKPDNHUIRUWKLV
modal statement.
x
We might say that it‚Äôs true because if people had voted differently, 
he would have won. But that only follows if people could have 
voted differently than they did. Was such a thing possible? So, that 
leads us right back to wondering about modal statements. 

88
Lecture 13: Causation, Possible Worlds, and Propositions
x
To answer these questions about modal statements, philosophers 
introduced the notion of possible worlds. A possible world 
represents a different way that all of reality could have gone. So, 
imagine a universe that is exactly like ours, except there is one 
difference: your shirt is a different color. That is a possible world. 
Imagine a universe where two things are different: your shirt is a 
different color, and you‚Äôre not wearing shoes. That is a possible 
world. For any given way that the universe could have gone, there 
is a possible world in which it went that way.
x
Possible worlds are not merely alternate universes. Possible worlds 
DUH GHVFULSWLRQV RI DQ HQWLUH UHDOLW\ QRW MXVW D XQLYHUVH 6RPH
possible worlds consist of one universe, and some possible worlds 
are multiverses, so we can‚Äôt think of possible worlds merely as 
alternate universes.
x
What philosophers suggest that modal statements amount to are 
statements about possible worlds. ‚ÄúRomney could have won the 
If people had voted differently in the 2012 election, then Mitt Romney would 
have won‚Äîbut could people have voted differently than they did?

Romney won the 2012 election.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople could have voted 
differently‚Äù amounts to ‚Äúthere is a possible world in which people 
did vote differently.‚Äù
x
Recall that we are looking for truthmakers for modal statements. 
So, if possible worlds are going to serve as truthmakers for 
modal statements, must they exist like states of affairs exist? The 
philosopher David Lewis suggests that they must. If we think that 
something serves as a truthmaker for a proposition, we must include 
it in our ontology‚Äîwe must think that it exists. 
x
When we discussed including future and past events in our 
ontology, we drew a distinction between their existence and their 
occurrence. The fact that you are committed to believing that a 
future event exists does not commit you to believing that it is 
presently occurring. Lewis suggests that, when it comes to possible 
worlds, we draw a distinction between existence and being actual. 
The fact that a possible world exists does not mean that it is actual; 
the only possible world that we can say is actual is our own. The 
other worlds exist, but are merely possible.
x
Some philosophers stop there, but David Lewis goes further. He 
VXJJHVWVWKDWWKRVHRWKHUZRUOGVDUHMXVWDVUHDODVRXURZQ7KH\
have an equal ontological status to our own. Sure, they are merely 
possible. But to the beings in those worlds, our world is merely 
possible. To them, their world is actual‚Äîat least according to 
Lewis. He is a realist about possible worlds.
x
Not all philosophers are friendly to this idea. Because there is an

exist. However, possible-world semantics is a very useful way to 
make sense of modal statements, and there are a number of attempts 
to preserve its meaning without such a bloated ontology.

Propositions and Universals
x
A proposition is not the same thing as a sentence; sentences express 
propositions, but they are not identical to propositions. Propositions 
have truth-values, and they are either true or false in virtue of 
whether or not they describe the world. Some propositions are never 
expressed. How can something have a truth-value and describe the 
ZRUOGLILWGRHVQRWH[LVWLQVRPHVHQVH"<RXFDQ¬∂W¬øQGSURSRVLWLRQV
in the world. So, if propositions exist, but are not in the world, then 
what are they?

GLIIHUHQWREMHFWVZLWKH[WUHPHO\GLIIHUHQWSURSHUWLHVFRXOGEHWKH
same type of thing. Modern philosophers still debate about such 
things, but in a slightly different way. The nature of properties is of 
considerable interest. 
x
We don‚Äôt want to deny that colors are real, but how can the same 
color be two places at once? No individual entity that exists in the 
universe can be two places at once, so, some philosophers argue, 
colors must not be individual entities that exist in the universe. They 
must be like forms, nonphysical abstract entities that exist outside 
the universe but can be possessed by individuals in the universe. 
This would be true for any property. Philosophers call such  
entities universals. 
x
Although you can see when an individual possesses a property, 
the universal itself is unobservable. Some philosophers think that 
the existence of universals is the best way to resolve philosophical 

91
problems; thus, they have no problem hypothesizing their existence. 
A realist theory of universals suggests that universals actually exist. 
x
Some philosophers don‚Äôt agree. They don‚Äôt like hypothesizing the 
existence of strange abstract entities and think that philosophical 
problems can be solved without them. Some philosophers want to

Regardless, it‚Äôs undeniable that possible worlds solve all kinds of 
philosophical problems, which is at least some reason for thinking

that they exist. David Lewis suggests that possible worlds can very 
easily solve the philosophical problems that surround causation.

According to Lewis, an event A causes an event B when it is the case 
that a world where A doesn‚Äôt occur but B still occurs is radically 
different from our own, compared to a world where neither occur.

etaphysics is the study of reality, including things that might 
exist outside our universe. You have learned about the possible 
existence of universals, propositions, and even other possible 
worlds‚Äîthings that you probably have never thought about before. However, 
this lecture will turn your attention to something that nearly everyone 
has thought about before‚Äîsomething that, if real, at least according to 
many, also exists outside of our universe: God. The idea of a perfect

WKH VWDQGDUG GH¬øQLWLRQ LV VXEMHFW WR D QXPEHU RI REMHFWLRQV WKDW
makes it quite problematic.
x
Traditionally, God is conceived of as an absolutely perfect 
being‚Äîhe or she has every good quality and to the maximum 
degree possible. God is supposedly unchangeable, transcendent, 
nonphysical, personal, omnipresent, and the creator of the universe. 
But for any one of these properties, there is an argument that 
suggests that it is inconsistent; for example, being omnipresent 
would imply that one is wholly and completely in all locations at all 
times. This might break down logically upon examination. 
x
Other arguments suggest that possessing two or more of these 
properties is logically impossible; the properties contradict one 

95
another. For example, is it possible to be a person and nonphysical? 
Being a person would include being minded, yet to be minded 
would seem to require having a physical brain. There are attempts 
WR DQVZHU WKHVH REMHFWLRQV EXW VXFK DUJXPHQWV KDYH OHG VRPH
theists to not include some of these properties in their conception 
of God.
x
/HW¬∂V IRFXV RQ GLI¬øFXOWLHV WKDW DULVH ZLWK WKUHH PDLQ SURSHUWLHV
that God traditionally is thought to have: all-encompassing power, 
knowledge, and love‚Äîwhat philosophers call omnipotence, 
omniscience, and omnibenevolence. For short, let‚Äôs call such a 
being tri-omni. 
x
We need to be very clear about what each tri-omni property amounts 
to. Take omnipotence, for example. Philosophers usually insist that 
God‚Äôs omnipotence does not include the ability to do that which is 
logically impossible, but they don‚Äôt think that this subtracts from 
his or her power anymore than not being able to make nonsense 
statements true subtracts from his or her power.
x
There are also similar limits to God‚Äôs knowledge‚Äîcertain 
things that it doesn‚Äôt make sense to suggest that God knows. 
Being perfectly knowledgeable amounts to this: believing every 
proposition that is true and none that are false. Even though God 
is omniscient, he or she doesn‚Äôt know anything about the exact 
properties of something that doesn‚Äôt exist because there is nothing 
to know. 
x
God‚Äôs omnibenevolence‚Äîthe assumption that God is all good‚Äî
entails that God is morally perfect; he or she always does what is 
morally best and never does what is evil or less than the best. Some 
have argued that the mere existence of evil in the world is evidence 
that an all-good being doesn‚Äôt exist that would prevent such things. 
However, it could be that allowing evil sometimes is logically 
the only way to accomplish some greater good‚Äîsome good that 
outweighs how bad the evil is.

Today, some philosophers and theologians want to abandon the idea 
of a perfect tri-omni God because there are certain philosophical 
and logical problems that render the idea problematic. This is not 
to say that all philosophers agree; many think the idea is coherent. 
But there are a number of potential inconsistencies that have caused 
some to abandon it. 
2PQLSRWHQFHYHUVXV,WVHOI

In what way is the very concept of God supposedly logically 
problematic? The most famous divine paradox is probably the easiest 
to solve. It pits omnipotence against itself. Can God create a rock so 
heavy that he or she cannot lift it? If not, then he or she is not all-
powerful. If so, then he or she is still not all-powerful. It seems that 
no matter how you answer the question, God is not all-powerful.
x
Many try to avoid this divine paradox by appealing to logical 
impossibility: Creating a rock that God cannot lift seems to imply a 
ORJLFDOFRQWUDGLFWLRQEHFDXVH*RGE\GH¬øQLWLRQLVDOOSRZHUIXO,W¬∂V
like saying that God can make the following proposition true: There 
is both an unliftable thing and a being who can lift everything. That 
seems to be logically incoherent‚Äîit‚Äôs nonsense‚Äîso God‚Äôs inability 
to make it true doesn‚Äôt mean that he is not all-powerful. 
x
Most philosophers agree, but some suggest that this logical 
incompatibility actually reveals the problem. They think that the 
existence of an omnipotent being would entail that that nonsense 
statement is true, when it can‚Äôt be. Thus, God can‚Äôt exist.

perfection. First, moral perfection may be logically incoherent. 
For God to be morally perfect, it must be true that it is impossible 
for him or her to perform evil actions. However, one is morally 
praiseworthy for not doing an evil action only if it were possible 
IRURQHWRGRWKDWDFWLRQLQWKH¬øUVWSODFH,I*RGGRHVQ¬∂WHYHQKDYH
the option of doing what is wrong, how can he or she be morally 
praiseworthy for doing what is right? And if he or she isn‚Äôt morally 

97
praiseworthy for what he or she does, how can he or she be a 
morally perfect being?
x
A related problem suggests that God‚Äôs moral perfection is logically 
LQFRQVLVWHQWZLWKKLVRUKHURPQLSRWHQFHRULQ¬øQLWHSRZHU,I*RG
is all-powerful, then he or she must be able to do anything that is 
logically consistent. Certainly, he or she can do anything that a human 
can do. But humans can do evil actions. However, for God to be all-
good, it seems that he or she cannot do evil. So, it seems logically 
inconsistent to suggest that God is both all-good and all-powerful.

doesn‚Äôt. This preserves God‚Äôs ability to do evil‚Äîand, thus, his or 
her omnipotence‚Äîand also entails that God gets moral credit for 
not doing evil actions.

This reply, however, might misunderstand the nature of moral

that God did an evil action.
2PQLEHQHYROHQFHYHUVXV2PQLVFLHQFH
x
Another paradox pits God‚Äôs moral perfection against his or her 
perfect knowledge. Moral responsibility requires free will. Thus, if 
God is morally praiseworthy for the actions he or she takes, then 
he or she must take them freely. However, God being all-knowing 
implies that God has foreknowledge. 

98
/HFWXUH*RG¬≤'H¬øQLWLRQDQG3DUDGR[
x
However, for the same reason that divine foreknowledge seems to 
be incompatible with human free will, divine foreknowledge would 
also be incompatible with divine free will. God‚Äôs foreknowledge 
would entail that his or her actions are already written on the time 
line‚Äîeven if God and his or her foreknowledge exist outside 
of the time line and, therefore, are timeless‚Äîand, thus, that it is 
impossible for him or her to do otherwise. 
x
But the problem is even worse for God. Because we don‚Äôt know what 
God‚Äôs beliefs about our future actions are, we can at least hold onto 
the illusion that we‚Äôre free. We can deliberate about which action 
we should take because, from our perspective, there are multiple 
possibilities‚Äîeven though there is only one. But God is aware of all 
his or her beliefs, so he or she already knows what he or she is going 
to choose. Deliberation is impossible for God, and it certainly seems 
that deliberation is required if an action is to be free.
x
There are a number of ways that theists attempt to avoid this 
REMHFWLRQ 6RPH WKHLVWV PLJKW VXJJHVW WKDW *RG LV WLPHOHVV DQG
therefore, the concepts of before and after don‚Äôt really apply to 
him or her. But making sense of how a timeless being could have 
free will‚Äîhow it could go through a process of deliberation and 
arrive at a choice‚Äîis equally problematic. To avoid this problem, 
RQH PLJKW DGRSW D GH¬øQLWLRQ RI IUHH ZLOO WKDW GRHV QRW UHTXLUH 
alternate possibilities.
1HZFRPE¬∂V3DUDGR[
x
Newcomb‚Äôs paradox points out that omniscience seems to give rise 
to the possibility of logically impossible situations. Suppose that 
God gives you a choice. In front of you are two boxes. One is clear, 
and you can see $1,000 inside it. The other is black, and you cannot 
see inside it. God then tells you that you can choose to have what‚Äôs 
under the black box or what‚Äôs under both boxes. 
x
What‚Äôs under the black box? God tells you that it‚Äôs one of two 
things: nothing or $1 million. But here‚Äôs the catch: God‚Äôs decision 
about what to place under the black box has already been made, and 

99
the money has already been placed. If the $1 million is there, it‚Äôs 
already there; if not, it‚Äôs not. 
x
But, God says, ‚ÄúI put $1 million under the black box only if I 
thought that you wouldn‚Äôt be greedy and choose both boxes. If I 
predicted that you would choose only the black box, then I put $1 
million under that box. If I predicted that you would choose both 
boxes, then I put nothing under the black box.‚Äù
x
What should you choose? Which choice would maximize the 
amount of money you receive? On one hand, you should choose 
only the black box. Because God is infallible, he or she would have 
known your choice and would have put $1 million under that box. 
On the other hand, you should choose both boxes. After all, the 
action of placing the money is already done, and God either placed 
the $1 million under the black box or didn‚Äôt. 
x
If he or she did, then choosing the black box would get you $1 
million, but choosing both gets you $1 million and $1,000. If he or 
she did not place the $1 million under the black box, then choosing 
only it would get you nothing‚Äîwhereas choosing both would get 
you at least $1,000. So, regardless of what he thought you would 
decide, because the deed is already done, you should choose 
both. Choosing both boxes is both the rational thing to do and the 
irrational thing to do. 
x
The existence of an omnipotent being gives rise to the possibility 
of a logical contradiction being true‚Äîand that‚Äôs impossible. So, it 
seems that the existence of an omniscient being is impossible.
x
The best way to avoid this paradox is to argue that one choice is

God‚ÄîThe Argument from Existence
Lecture 15
T
he God that will be discussed in this lecture is the traditional God‚Äî
the perfect being. The argument is called the ontological argument, 
or the argument from existence. The advantage of the ontological 
argument is that it is purely conceptual. You don‚Äôt have to observe anything 
in the world to know whether or not its premises are true. In addition, it‚Äôs 
a deductive argument. The conclusion of a sound deductive argument is 
guaranteed. So, if the ontological argument works, then God‚Äôs existence is 
proven. Constructing a sound deductive argument, however‚Äîespecially one

Benedictine monk who served as archbishop of Canterbury from

existing‚Äîentails a logical contradiction.

apart is that one exists in reality and the other one exists only in 
your mind.

Next, Anselm points out that God is a perfect being‚Äîat least that‚Äôs 
WKHGH¬øQLWLRQKH¬∂VZRUNLQJZLWK$QGWKDWPHDQVDV$QVHOPSXWVLW
that God is the greatest conceivable being. If God is perfect, then 
it is not possible to conceive of a being greater than God; it‚Äôs not 
possible to be greater than perfection.

Next, Anselm observes that he has an idea of God. He looks in his

conceivable being.
x
But, Anselm says, let‚Äôs suppose that you don‚Äôt believe that God 
exists. If that is the case, then your idea of God does not include the 
property of existence. According to Anselm, what it is to believe 
that something exists is to have an idea of it in your mind and 
ascribe the property of existence to it. If you don‚Äôt believe in God, 
then you have the idea, but your idea does not include the property 
of existence. 
x
But the thing is that if your idea of God does not include the property 
of existence, then it‚Äôs not really an idea of the greatest conceivable 
being. Why? Because someone could conceive of a being greater 
than the one you are conceiving of. How? By conceiving of a being

someone takes your idea of a nonexistent God but then believes that 
it exists, that person‚Äôs idea is greater.
x
But if your idea of God is not an idea of the greatest conceivable 
being, then it‚Äôs not really an idea of God. So, if you say that you 
don‚Äôt believe that God exists, then you are saying that you have an 
idea of God, but that the idea is not actually of God‚Äîand that‚Äôs a 
contradiction. And logical contradictions can‚Äôt be true.
x
So, Anselm reasons, if not believing in God would entail something 
that can‚Äôt be true, then God must exist. It‚Äôs basically a reductio 
ad absurdum argument, which proves that something is wrong by 
assuming it is right and then showing that an absurd consequence 
follows doing so. Anselm is pointing to the absurd consequence of 
a logical contradiction being true as something that follows from 
believing that God doesn‚Äôt exist.
x
Anselm prefaces his argument with Psalm 14:1 ‚ÄúThe fool hath said 
in his heart, ‚ÄòThere is no God.‚Äô‚Äù Anselm is essentially arguing that 
people who say that they don‚Äôt believe in God are contradicting 
themselves. They are basically saying that their idea of God both 
has the property of existence (because it is an idea of the greatest 
conceivable being) and does not have the property of existence 
(because they do not believe that God exists). Only a fool would 
contradict themselves, and if you must believe in God or be a fool, 
then God must exist.

version of Anselm‚Äôs argument belongs to another 11th-century 
clergyman-philosopher named Gaunilo of Marmoutier, who 

104
Lecture 15: God‚ÄîThe Argument from Existence
argued against the validity of Anselm‚Äôs argument by presenting a 
counterexample‚Äîan argument that takes the exact same form as 
$QVHOP¬∂VDUJXPHQWDQGKDVSUHPLVHVWKDWDUHMXVWDVREYLRXVO\WUXH
but whose conclusion is obviously false. This demonstrates that 
Anselm‚Äôs argument is invalid‚Äîthat his conclusion does not follow 
from its premises. 
x
To do this, he takes Anselm‚Äôs argument, exactly as it is, and simply 
replaces the word ‚Äúbeing‚Äù with the word ‚Äúisland.‚Äù If Anselm‚Äôs 
argument works, then Gaunilo‚Äôs argument would prove that a 
greatest conceivable island must exist. However, not only does such 
an island not exist, but clearly the fact that an imaginary perfect 
island is not as good as a real one doesn‚Äôt establish that one exists. 
In a sense, Gaunilo presents a reductio of his own: If Anselm‚Äôs 
argument is valid, then a perfect island exists; clearly, it doesn‚Äôt, so 
his argument must be faulty.
x
Anselm responds by saying that the reasoning of his argument can 
only be applied to God, not to things like islands. Unfortunately, 
his argument to this effect is not exactly clear. But, in essence, it 
goes like this: Because the greatest conceivable being is both 
uncreateable and indestructible‚Äîand, in fact, if it were to not 
exist at any moment in time at all, it would not be the greatest 
conceivable being‚Äîthen existence must be part of its essence,

evaluate, given that Anselm‚Äôs second argument is not that clear

already exists in our world, the fact that it exists in all possible

Modern Ontological Arguments
x
Some philosophers, most notably Alvin Plantinga and Norman 
Malcolm, have tried to use possible-world semantics to present an 

106
Lecture 15: God‚ÄîThe Argument from Existence
argument similar to Anselm‚Äôs that they believe establishes God‚Äôs 
existence. Let‚Äôs call it the modal argument.
x
A possible world expresses a different way that all reality could 
have been. Something is possible if it is true in one possible world, 
something is impossible if it is true in no possible worlds, and 
something is necessary if it is true in all possible worlds.
x
With that in mind, the modal argument is simple. It‚Äôs possible 
that a necessary being exists‚Äîthe concept of a necessary being 
is conceivable and is not logically inconsistent. But that means 
that a necessary being exists in at least one possible world. But, 
E\ GH¬øQLWLRQ D QHFHVVDU\ EHLQJ LV RQH WKDW H[LVWV LQ DOO SRVVLEOH
worlds. So, it follows that in one possible world, there is a being 
that exists in all possible worlds. The actual world is a possible 
world. Therefore, that necessary being must exist in the actual 
world. And, of course, that being would be God. 
x
In simpler modal terms, the argument goes like this: If God is 
possible, then he or she is necessary. God is possible. So, he or she 
is necessary‚Äîand if God is necessary, then he or she exists. The 
argument is clever. But most philosophers agree, even theists, that 
there is something fundamentally wrong with it.
x
The argument begs the question‚Äîit assumes what it is trying to 
prove. To accept its premise that God‚Äôs existence is possible, we 
would have to already admit that God exists. Even if we aren‚Äôt 
realists about possible worlds, the argument still begs the question 
and, thus, fails. In a way, the argument is backward; it puts the cart 
before the horse. But no other argument besides the ontological 
argument argues directly for the existence of a perfect being.

obvious that Anselm‚Äôs original ontological argument doesn‚Äôt work. Why 
do you think he proposed it? Do you think that he knew it didn‚Äôt work, 
but proposed it anyway?
2. Here is an ontological argument against God‚Äôs existence: If God exists, 
then he or she exists in all possible worlds. It‚Äôs possible that God doesn‚Äôt 
exist. If it‚Äôs possible that God doesn‚Äôt exist, then he or she doesn‚Äôt exist 
in at least one possible world. If God doesn‚Äôt exist in one possible world, 
then he or she doesn‚Äôt exist in them all. Therefore, God doesn‚Äôt exist. 
This argument is valid; essentially, it‚Äôs Plantinga‚Äôs argument in reverse. 
Do you think it works? Why, or why not? What does your answer say

is there something rather than nothing? Think of this exploration of the 
cosmological argument not only as a foray into whether God exists, but also 
into why the universe exists.

There are multiple versions of the cosmological argument. The 
simplest one goes like this: Every event has a cause. But every 
cause is itself an event, which means that it must have a cause. But 
that must also have a cause, so there seems to be a causal chain‚Äîa 
progression of causes and effects reaching back into the past. 
x
%XW WKDW FDXVDO FKDLQ FDQ¬∂W EH LQ¬øQLWH LW FDQQRW MXVW NHHS JRLQJ
back forever. It must end in something, and whatever it ends in 
must itself be a cause but must not be caused by anything else: It 
must be an uncaused causer that sits at the end of the causal chain. 
And that uncaused cause must be God.
x
There are multiple problems with this argument. First, it seems to 
MXPSWRWKH*RGFRQFOXVLRQIDUWRRTXLFNO\(YHQLIWKHUHLVD¬øUVW
cause, nothing in this argument tells us anything about the nature of 
that cause‚Äîthat it is all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, or even 
that it is a being or person. You would need a separate argument for 
that, and although a few have been proposed, philosophers aren‚Äôt 
very convinced by them.
x
%XWSHUKDSVWKHDUJXPHQWHVWDEOLVKHVWKDWWKHUHLVD¬øUVWXQFDXVHG
cause. Might that at least need to be some kind of deity? 

109
Unfortunately not. First, we know that the universe originated 
IURP D VLQJXODULW\¬≤DQ LQ¬øQLWHO\ VPDOO SRLQW WKDW H[LVWHG IRU QR
time and is governed by no known laws‚Äîfrom which the big bang  
was generated. 
x
6RZHDOUHDG\KDYHDFDQGLGDWHIRUD¬øUVWFDXVHWKHVLQJXODULW\
from which the universe emerged. And, if anything is a candidate 
for something that is uncaused, it would seem to be the singularity. 
First, because the big bang marks the beginning of time, nothing 
can come before the singularity. However, causes precede their 
effects. So, it seems that the singularity cannot have a cause because 
nothing can come before it. 
x
In addition, the singularity is about as simple as you can get. It is as 
small as you can get, exists for no time, and is governed by no laws. 
Whatever else you introduced as a cause for the singularity would 
seem to demand a cause even more than the singularity itself, 
HVSHFLDOO\LI\RXLQWURGXFHGDGHLW\WKDWKDVDZLGHDUUD\RILQ¬øQLWH
properties, like omnipotence. So, at least initially, if there must be 
an uncaused causer, it seems that the singularity is the most likely 
candidate. The only thing that would seem to demand a cause less 
than the singularity would be nothingness.
x
But, ironically, nothingness may actually be the explanation for 
the singularity. First, because of quantum mechanics, we know 
that there are uncaused events. So, we actually know that the 
¬øUVW SUHPLVH RI WKLV DUJXPHQW¬≤WKDW HYHU\ HYHQW KDV D FDXVH¬≤LV
false. But more importantly, it is common knowledge in quantum 
mechanics that the creation of matter can be uncaused‚Äîthat it can 
spring from nothing. So, even if there is an uncaused causer, it 
need not necessarily be a deity of any kind. The singularity would 
be a much better candidate for an uncaused causer, because it is  
nearly propertyless. 
x
But there may not even need to be an uncaused causer because

seems to refute itself. It stipulates that every event has a cause, 
but every cause is an event. It follows from this necessarily that 
anything that is a cause must be caused. But then it concludes that 
there is a cause that is not caused‚Äîan uncaused causer. You can‚Äôt 
say that every cause has a cause, but then say that there is a cause 
that doesn‚Äôt have a cause. The conclusion of the argument is refuted

Recognizing the shortcomings of this argument, some have 
revamped and revised it into an argument regarding explanation. 
The primary premise of this argument is called the principle of 
VXI¬øFLHQWUHDVRQ,WVXJJHVWVWKDWHYHU\WKLQJQHHGVDQH[SODQDWLRQ
So, everything either has an explanation outside of itself or is its

x
Philosophers call something that is explained by something 
else a dependent entity; it is dependent on something else for its 
existence. But, the argument assumes, it can‚Äôt be that everything 
is dependent; it can‚Äôt be that everything is explained by something

reason‚Äîthe chain itself would need an explanation. So, the 
argument concludes, something must be nondependent, something 
must be its own explanation. And that would be God.

amounts to saying that the truth-value of every proposition must

an explanation.

the God conclusion. Even if there is a self-explained thing, nothing 
in this argument entails that that thing must be all-powerful, all-

regarded as persuasive.

Some theists maintain that the universe can‚Äôt be its own explanation, 
but God can. So, it is preferable to introduce God as a self-explained 
entity to thus explain the universe, which demands an explanation. 
Why does the universe demand an outside explanation but God 
does not? Because, the argument suggests, everything that begins to 
exist must have an outside explanation.

explanation is the same thing as demanding that the universe needs 
an explanation. So, in short, the Kalam cosmological argument 
begins with the premise and ends with the same conclusion: The 
matter of the universe needs an explanation. Clearly, this argument 
gets us nowhere.

Why is there something rather than nothing? Why is the proposition

the most academically cited argument for God‚Äôs existence. But the argument

it is the way it is. So, as with the cosmological argument, you should keep in 
mind such questions as you consider the teleological argument.

famous design argument belongs 
to the 18th-century philosopher 
William Paley.
x
Paley pointed out that if you 
found a stone, you would not 
likely conclude that the stone had 
a designer; however, if you found 
a watch, you would certainly 
conclude that it had an intelligent 
designer because it clearly has 
parts that were placed with a 
purpose. Paley argues that, in the 
same way, biological beings like 
humans have parts placed for 
a purpose. Thus, we must have  
a designer.
Humans seem like they have 
an intelligent designer because 
they have parts that were 
placed with a purpose‚Äîjust 
like a watch has.

Although it was probably thought to be a good argument given 
what people knew at the time, Paley‚Äôs argument can no longer be 
considered a good argument. Put simply, the theory of evolution‚Äî
one of the most well-established theories in all of science‚Äîshows 
that Paley was wrong. 
x
Evolution shows how living organisms can have parts that have 
particular functions without those organisms being designed. 
Evolution is not incompatible with theistic or Christian beliefs. In 
fact, most religions and religious organizations in the world are 
openly accepting of the theory of evolution.

However, we are now discovering that there are reasons to think 
that there are multiple universes. If there are multiple universes

Most probabilities have a bias, regardless of whether that bias is 
explained by a person or natural conditions. So, unless there is 
evidence that no such bias exists for the factors that govern the laws

One of the driving forces behind Einstein‚Äôs development of 
relativity was questions about the nature of space itself. Think 
about the space between the Earth and the Sun. A few planets, a few 
asteroids, and comets aside, that space is empty‚Äîthere is nothing 
in it. But what does ‚Äúspace‚Äù mean 
in that sentence? Is space itself a

that we use to keep track of the

x
What would be the difference 
between the substance view and 
the relational view of space? 
Consider a universe that consists 
RI RQO\ WZR REMHFWV WZR SHUVRQV

in space. Is it possible for those 
persons to both move exactly one  
foot to the left at the same time? If this happens, there will be no 
noticeable difference for either person. Each would be facing the 
same direction and be the same distance from the other person

and the Sun a substance or  
an idea?

123
both before and after the supposed move. The spatial relationship 
between the two persons would not change. 
x
On the substance view, this is possible. On the substance view, the 
VSDFHLQZKLFKWKHSHUVRQVDUH√ÄRDWLQJLVDUHDOWKLQJ¬≤DVXEVWDQFH
with its own properties and facts‚Äîand they could move within 
it. These are matters of fact that can serve as truthmakers for 
propositions like ‚Äúboth persons moved one foot to the left.‚Äù 
x
However, on the relational view, this is not possible. If space 
is not a real thing and all that exists is the relationship between 
REMHFWVWKHQLQUHODWLRQWRZKDWZRXOGERWKSHUVRQVPRYHWRWKH
left? Because both of them are ‚Äúmoving‚Äù the same direction and 
distance, the relationship between the two persons does not change, 
so on the relational view, there is no change. Therefore, there can‚Äôt 
be a truthmaker for ‚Äúboth persons moved one foot to the left.‚Äù The 
only way a change could occur is if a relationship changed‚Äîlike if 
the distance between them increased.
x
That is the difference between the substance, or substantival, view 
and the relational view of space. There is a similar debate about the

happening? Again, there are a substantival and a relational view. 
x
To differentiate these views, ask yourself whether it is possible 
for all change and movement in the universe to stop at once, stay 
stopped for 100 years, and then start up again. If this were to occur, 
we would not be able to tell. Not only would we not age, and 
not only would our hair not grow, but because all movement and 
changes in our brains would cease, we would have no awareness 
and form no memories.
x
A temporal ontology that includes a past, present, and future would 
seem to be more in line with the view that time is a substance. We 
could make perfect sense of what it would mean for no change to

occur for a year. The time line would simply contain a year‚Äôs worth 
of identical moments. However, if you thought that the past and 
future don‚Äôt exist‚Äîthat all that ever exists is the present moment‚Äî
then it would seem to make more sense to suggest that if change 
stops, time stops.

x
For a long time, there was thought to be good evidence and 
reasoning behind the substantival view of space. An example is 
1HZWRQ¬∂VVSLQQLQJEXFNHW,PDJLQHDEXFNHW¬øOOHGZLWKZDWHUDQG
secured upright in the middle of a merry-go-round. As the bucket 
spins, the water will slowly climb up the sides of the bucket so that 
the surface of the water in the bucket becomes concave. 
x
In the relational model, this change in the water‚Äôs surface must be 
due somehow to a new relation that it has to something else in the 
world. It must be spinning in relation to something that causes its 
surface to become concave. But what could it be? 
x
It can‚Äôt be the merry-go-round; that‚Äôs spinning along with the 
EXFNHW%HVLGHVWDNHWKHPHUU\JRURXQGDZD\DQGMXVWVSLQWKH
bucket, and you will get the same effect. It also can‚Äôt be because 
WKHEXFNHWLVVSLQQLQJLQUHODWLRQWRWKHUHVWRIWKHREMHFWVRQWKH
playground. If you were to take all of that, ground included, and put 
it on a giant merry-go-round with the bucket at the center, you‚Äôd see 
the same effect. 
x
Newton argued that the only answer that makes sense is the 
substantival model. The bucket is spinning in relation to space 
itself: Space is a substance, and the bucket is spinning within 
it. In the relational model, if there were a universe that only 
contained a bucket full of water, if the bucket started spinning, 
nothing would happen; the surface of the water wouldn‚Äôt become 
concave, and there would be no way to even tell if it was spinning 
because there would be nothing else in the universe to which its  
relationship changed. 

125
x
But Newton thinks that it would change‚Äîthat the water in a bucket 
spinning in an otherwise empty universe would become concave, 
and that‚Äôs because the bucket would still be spinning with respect 
to space itself.
Special Relativity 
x
Proving the substantival view wrong was one of Einstein‚Äôs main 
motivations for hypothesizing the theory of relativity. The word 
‚Äúrelativity‚Äù in the title of Einstein‚Äôs theory is somewhat ironic 
because it begins with the assumption that certain very important 
WKLQJVDUHQRWUHODWLYH¬≤WKH\DUHFRQVWDQW6SHFL¬øFDOO\WKHODZVRI
physics are constant. Einstein suggested that they are constant in all 
inertial reference frames.
x
Basically, there is a reference frame for any way that you may 
be moving or standing still in space. And it‚Äôs important to realize 
that, in relativity theory, the existence of a reference frame is 
not dependent on an observer; no one need actually be moving 
or standing still in that reference frame for it to exist. It‚Äôs more 
of a conceptual apparatus‚Äîa way that physicists describe how 
an observer could be moving. It‚Äôs not necessarily a way that an 
observer actually is moving. 
x
Special relativity only applies to inertial reference frames; that 
is, it only applies to reference frames that are not accelerating. 
Einstein suggests that the laws of physics are constant in all inertial 
reference frames. You cannot distinguish among inertial frames of 
reference by differentiating their physical laws from one another, 
because the laws remain constant from one frame of reference to 
the next. According to Einstein, this includes, most importantly, the 
speed of light.
x
If true, this goes against the substantival view. If space were 
a real substance in which light traveled, then its speed would be 
determined in relation to that substance. Einstein said that if you 
measure the speed of light, no matter how fast you are going, or 

126
Lecture 18: From Spinning Buckets to Special Relativity
where the light is coming from, you always get the same value‚Äî
which is, approximately, 300 million meters per second. 
x
If space is not a substance, then there is no reference frame that

or if an event happens, then it happens in all reference frames. But

about such things.
x
There would be a privileged reference frame if space were 
substantival; the reference frame of motionless space itself would 
UHSUHVHQWWKHREMHFWLYHWUXWK%XWZLWKRXWWKDWWKHUHLVQRIDFWRIWKH
matter about which reference frame gets it right. 
x
The consistency of the speed of light in all reference frames has 
very interesting consequences. For example, not only are speed 
and motion relative to reference frames, but so is simultaneity‚Äî
whether two events happened at once. Because the speed of light is 
constant, whether or not two events are simultaneous is relative to 
reference frame.
x
Simultaneity is not the only thing that is relative. Length is also 
relative. If someone is traveling past you and holding a yardstick, 
while you hold a yardstick, they will measure your yardstick as 
being shorter than theirs, while you will measure theirs as shorter 
than yours. Another example is that a pencil on your right is also to 
the left of the person sitting across the table from you. It all depends 
on your frame of reference. 
x
We can also use the consistency of the speed of light to demonstrate 
what is called time dilation‚Äîthat the amount of time between 
events, the speed at which change is occurring, and the passage of 
time itself are relative to reference frame. 

127
x
This is what Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity suggested was true, but 
is there any way to verify this? In fact, there is. Time dilation has 
been observed. The half-life of muons‚Äîextremely fast-moving 
particles‚Äîis measurably longer if they are moving past us, whereas 
if they are sitting in a laboratory, their half-life is notably shorter. 
x
The phenomenon of time dilation shows us that space and time 
are related, and we are again wondering about whether space and 
time are substantival or merely relational. Does the relativity of 
simultaneity, length contraction, and time dilation indicate that 
space and time are merely relationships between events‚Äîthat all 
there is are different facts about how events are related in different 
reference frames? Or are space and time themselves, as substances, 
somehow being stretched or compressed in different reference 
frames? And given their direct relation, are space and time actually

one about space, and not one about time, but one about space-time.

1. Relativity suggests that there is no preferred reference frame‚Äîthat no 
reference frame has special properties that make it better than another. 
But since the big bang, the intensity of the microwave background 
radiation left from it has been slowly decreasing, and there are reference 
frames where the intensity of that radiation would not be uniform‚Äîit 
would be more dense on one side of the universe than another. In fact, 
all reference frames but one would be like this. Does that mean that there

x
In special relativity, all laws of physics‚Äîincluding the speed of 
light‚Äîare constant in all inertial reference frames; however, an 
inertial reference frame is one that is not accelerating, decelerating, 
or changing direction. What about those? Are the laws of physics 
constant in non-inertial reference frames?
x
If they are not, then Einstein‚Äôs case against the substantival view 
is weakened. If the laws of physics are different in non-inertial 
reference frames, then it could be because those frames are 
accelerating in relation to space itself. So, general relativity is 
Einstein‚Äôs attempt to explain how the laws of physics, including the 
speed of light, are constant in all reference frames‚Äîincluding non-
inertial ones.

can be found in inertial reference frames, too.

Einstein suggested that the effects of acceleration could be 
described and accounted for by exactly the same laws as gravity. 
In short, the effects of acceleration are indistinguishable from the

To test his theory, an eclipse was predicted, and a star was found 
that would be behind the Sun but close to its edge. Newton‚Äôs laws, 
which suggest that light always travels in straight lines, predicted 
that you would not be able to see the star. Einstein predicted that the 
light from the star would bend around our Sun and still be visible. 

131
Einstein was right; the star was visible. This effect is now called the 
gravitational lens effect.
x
We can also derive the effects of acceleration on the passage of 
time. For example, the acceleration of a ship causes time to pass 
more quickly at the front of the ship than at the back. But recall 
that the effects of acceleration are identical to the effects of gravity.

With both time dilation and gravitational lensing in mind, we can 
now understand what Einstein is talking about when he talks about 
space-time and what it means for space-time to be curved. Take 
light, for example. The speed of light is constant, and nothing can 
travel faster than it. As a result, the path that light takes between 
WZRSRLQWVPXVWE\GH¬øQLWLRQEHWKHVKRUWHVWSDWKEHWZHHQWKRVH
points. If there were a shorter path, something else could travel 
there faster in violation of the ‚Äúnothing faster than light‚Äù principle.

be curved.
x
We can say something similar about the effect of gravity on time. 
Think about the standard three dimensions that we encounter every 
day. Take a single mathematical point that has no dimensions. If 
you stack up a whole collection of those points, you get a line. 
x
A line has one dimension: length. Extend that line by stacking up 
a bunch of lines together outside that dimension, and you get a

square. The square has both length and width. Extend the square 
into the third dimension to get a cube that has length, width, and 
height. These are the standard three dimensions in which we move. 
But we also move in time. Stack a bunch of three-dimensional

x
The fact that clocks farther away from a gravitational source tick 
faster than those closer to the gravitational source seems to indicate 
that the clocks that are farther away from the gravitational source 
are traveling farther through time. In the same way that a car going 
60 miles an hour traverses a farther distance than one going 30 
miles an hour, a clock farther away from a gravitational source 
seems to traverse more time. Therefore, it seems that gravity not 
only warps space, but also warps time. 
x
And this seems to suggest that time is a substance‚Äîsomething 
that can be warped and traversed, something that collects more 
densely around the source of gravity, making it thicker and harder 
to traverse, whereas it is more spread out and thin the farther away 
from the source of gravity, making it easier to traverse.

x
But this is not an entirely accurate explanation. Einstein‚Äôs general 
theory of relativity did away with the need to hypothesize the 
existence of gravity at all. The Earth orbits the Sun not because

There are two views in the philosophy of science about how to

hypothetical entities that cannot be directly observed: realism and 
instrumentalism. Consider atomic theory, which suggests that all 
matter consists of tiny particles called atoms that are combined and

x
There are two possibilities. One is that atoms exist as hypothesized, 
and the reason for accurate results when the theory was tested 
is because they behave as the theory suggests. This is the realist 
view. Another possibility is that the hypothesis merely produces 
accurate predictions, but does not actually describe the way the 
world is. Atoms don‚Äôt actually exist, but hypothesizing that they do 
is a useful tool‚Äîan instrument‚Äîfor making predictions. This is the 
instrumentalist view.
x
Einstein seemed to favor an instrumental view of space-time. 
Hypothesizing the existence of space-time, and speaking as if 
it actually exists, is a very useful way of making predictions

accurately describes the way the world is‚Äîthat space-time exists 
as a substance. Ultimately, it could be that the curvature of space-

Light bends around the Sun not because space-time is curved, but 
simply because that is how light relates to the Sun.
x
Although we can actually observe atoms, we will likely never be 
able to observe space-time. While there may someday be a way 
to settle the issue, there are currently good reasons on both sides 
that keep the issue up in the air. The relational model is simpler

fewer entities. It does not treat space-time as a substance. On the 
other hand, the substantival view seems to have very wide scope‚Äî
strong explanatory power‚Äîand that is a huge mark in its favor. 
Which view you favor depends on your metaphysical leanings.

Regardless of whether you accept the relational or substantival view, 
relativity still entails the temporal ontology that is incompatible 
with free will. Recall that simultaneity is relative to reference 
frames. Relativity produces a picture of the universe that shows it

think of them as bearing relations to one another. Regardless, 
relativity suggests that all of the events in the entire history of the 
universe coexist in a giant space-time block.

worldview‚Äîomnitemporalism‚Äîwhich suggests that the future 
exists before it occurs. This view of time is incompatible with 
human free will, at least the libertarian variety, because it entails 
that we can perform no actions other than the actions that exist in 
the block.

s it possible to travel in time the same way that one travels in space? 
This question is too simplistic; it‚Äôs like asking if we can travel in space. 
Of course we can. The interesting question is what kinds of limits exist 
regarding how we can travel in space. For example, can the rate at which we 
travel in time be altered? If so, can we have voluntary control of that rate? 
Can we change the direction through which we travel in time? Can we travel 
to the past? Can we skip over moments in time to arrive directly at some 
distant future or distant past moment?

massive‚Äîand, thus, bend space-time to such a massive degree‚Äî
that if anything gets too close to them, including light, it cannot 
escape. That is why they are called black holes. We can‚Äôt see them;

x
You can‚Äôt get too close to a black hole; otherwise, you get sucked 
in and can never escape. But if you could take a spaceship and orbit 
around the event horizon of a black hole, the area beyond which 
nothing can escape, you would experience extreme time dilation. To 
those in the outside universe, it would seem as if you were almost 
frozen, but you would experience time passing normally. Once you

time had passed in the universe than you had experienced while 
orbiting the black hole. The longer you orbited, the greater time 
difference there would be between your experience and that of the 
rest of the universe, so you could even have control of how far in 
the future you traveled. Unfortunately, this is not a feasible method 
of time travel. 
x
Another possible way to experience time dilation is with what 
Newton called a mass shell. Basically, a mass shell is a massive

x
Another method for traveling into the future can be derived from 
special relativity. Someone traveling in a spaceship away from 
the Earth at near the speed of light who then turned around and 
FDPHEDFNDWQHDUWKHVSHHGRIOLJKWZRXOGUHWXUQWR¬øQGWKDWPRUH
time had passed on Earth than he or she had experienced in his or 
her travels. This is sometimes referred to as relative velocity time 
dilation or the twin paradox. This method of time travel is not 
presently feasible‚Äîwe have no such ship, it would have to go really 
fast for the effect to even be moderate, and you‚Äôd end up wasting 
most of your life traveling in the process. 
Wormholes
x
Time travel as it is conventionally conceived involves skipping 
over moments in time, directly traveling from the present to the 
future‚Äîand then back to the present. Fortunately, relativity does 
suggest that such time travel is theoretically possible. 
x
A possible method of time travel that, although currently 
technologically impossible, might one day be possible is called a 
wormhole, and it‚Äôs best understood with a metaphor. Think about 
a two-dimensional piece of paper with two dots. The shortest 
distance between those two points is represented by a straight line 
GUDZQRQWKHSLHFHRISDSHUEXWRQO\LIWKHSDSHUUHPDLQV√ÄDW,I
you were to bend the paper into the third dimension so that the dots 
touched, you could travel between them directly, bypassing the line 
connecting the two points on the paper.
x
The idea behind a wormhole is that space-time could be bent in 
exactly the same way. We could bend it through a higher dimension, 
often called hyperspace, so that different points of space-time touch 
and allow instantaneous travel between them. We could not only 
use this to travel great distances in space, but also to different 
moments in time. 

139
x
The good news is that we don‚Äôt have to create wormholes because 
they actually happen all the time. The bad news is that they are 
super tiny‚Äîsmaller than subatomic particles‚Äîand they blink 
in and out of existence so quickly that not even light can travel

an already existing wormhole and keep it open, we could use it as a 
time machine.
x
Will we ever do this? The goal of those who study such things 
is simply to demonstrate what is consistent with relativity. Of 
course, physical or technological limits may prevent us from ever 
accomplishing this. However, there may also be philosophical

time travel into the past.

x
Logical arguments against the possibility of time travel rely on 
the most fundamental axiom of logic: the law of noncontradiction. 
Contradictions are statements that suggest that a proposition is both 
true and false at the same time. The law does not merely state that 
contradictions happen not to be true; rather, it states that it is not 
possible for any contradiction to be true. 
x
In the vernacular of possible-worlds talk, there is no possible world 
in which a contradiction is true. The truth of this law stands behind 
all logic, reasoning, and argument. Everything we have learned as a 
species, and our ability to communicate at all, assumes the truth of 
the law of noncontradiction.
x
The possibility of time travel seems to entail the possibility of a 
true contradiction. The argument that points this out is called 
the grandfather paradox. If you can travel into the past, then you 
can travel to a point in time before your grandfather met your 
grandmother, and subsequently, you could kill your grandfather. 
Consequently, your father will never be born, and you will never 
be born. However, if you are never born, then you cannot travel 
back in time to kill your grandfather. Time travel seems to make it 

140
Lecture 20: Black Holes, Wormholes, and Time Travel
possible that you both exist and you don‚Äôt exist‚Äîthat you both kill 
your grandfather and you don‚Äôt. 
x
You can‚Äôt solve this paradox and make time travel possible by 
simply deciding not to kill your grandfather. This is how science 
¬øFWLRQ VRPHWLPHV DYRLGV GHDOLQJ ZLWK WKLV SDUDGR[ EXW WKH ODZ
of noncontradiction doesn‚Äôt merely state that contradictions aren‚Äôt 
true‚Äîit says that they‚Äôre not even possibly true. Because it seems 
that time travel makes it possible for you to kill your grandfather, 
then time travel makes it possible for a contradiction to be true‚Äî
and that violates the law. 
x
But some philosophers, such as David Lewis, have argued 
that this paradox can be solved, and not by denying the law of 
QRQFRQWUDGLFWLRQ 7KDW ZRXOG PDNH WKH HGL¬øFH RI DOO NQRZOHGJH
crumble. David Lewis argued that if you were to travel into the 
past, certain actions would be impossible to perform. If you were 
to attempt to kill your grandfather, then you would necessarily fail. 
x
The ability to time travel to the past would not enable you to change 
the past. If you will travel to the past, the actions you will take 
when there have already occurred‚Äîthey are already a part of your 
time line, or the block. You can observe the past and participate in 
the past, but you cannot change it. In fact, if you go back in time 
with the intention of preventing a historical event, not only will you 
be unable to‚Äîbecause the action of you failing to do so is already 
written in the block‚Äîbut you might discover that you are in fact the 
cause of it. 
Causal Loops

realize that time travel would make causal loops‚Äîsituations where 
A causes B and B causes C, but then C causes A‚Äîpossible. For 
example, if a past event causes you to be fascinated with it, but your 
fascination with the event causes you to travel in time to observe 
it, and then you end up causing it, then your fascination causes the 
event, and the event causes your fascination: a causal loop.

the mineshaft. Who invented the time machine? Where did the idea 
originally come from? 
x
A similar problem shows that time travel makes it possible for you 
to create yourself. If such paradoxes can be resolved, time travel 
might help us make sense of what it means for something to be a 
self-caused entity.
$OWHUQDWH7LPH/LQHV
x
There actually is one version of paradox-free time travel, although 
some might contend that it‚Äôs not really time travel at all. There 
are reasons for believing that there is more than one universe‚Äî
that the reality that exists is a multiverse. One conception of time 
travel suggests that if you were to travel to the past, you would not 
travel to the past of your own universe, but to the past of a universe 
identical to yours up to the point that you appear in the past. In 
fact, the act of time travel might be responsible for the creation of  
that universe. 
x
If so, it is not possible to travel into your own past and kill your 
own grandfather, but it is possible to create a new universe with 
a past identical to your own up to a certain point, and then make 
that universe‚Äôs history turn out differently. For example, in that 
universe, you could kill that universe‚Äôs version of your grandfather 
and, thus, prevent a version of yourself from ever being born in 
that universe. But because you were born in a different universe, it 
would not paradoxically prevent your own existence.

Quantum mechanics shows us that there are some events that are 
truly random and occur without a cause, such as radioactive decay, 
but it also tells us that the fundamental nature of reality is different 
than it intuitively seems. When we look at the world around us, the 
ZRUOGRIPHGLXPVL]HGREMHFWVHYHU\WKLQJVHHPVVROLG(YHU\WKLQJ
has a location, momentum, and a cause behind the properties it has. 
So, it seems that the same thing is true for the particles that make up 
PHGLXPVL]HGREMHFWV%XWTXDQWXPPHFKDQLFVWHOOVXVWKDWRQWKH
atomic and subatomic levels, things are different.
x
Before quantum mechanics came along, we already knew that 
certain things in the subatomic world were different. For example, 
we thought that the fundamental nature of light was wavelike‚Äîthat 
light consisted of waves, like sound, not particles. 
x
The most famous example that shows that light is a wave is called 
the double-slit experiment. Take a light source and shine it on a 
wall. Then, take a divider, cut two vertical slits in it, and place it 
between the light source and the wall. This will change the way 
the wall is lit by the light source. If you place the divider a certain 
distance from the wall‚Äîa distance that bears a certain relation to 
the distance between the slits‚Äîthen you will get what‚Äôs called an 
interference pattern, the same kind of interference pattern that is 
observed when two sound waves interact. The two slits divide the 
light into two waves that then interfere with one another and thus 
create an interference pattern. So, because light behaves like a 
wave, it was concluded that its nature was wavelike. 
x
What started to cause problems was when we realized that other 
experiments proved that light was not wavelike, but made of 
particles. This happened when Einstein explained the photoelectric 
HIIHFW7KHDWRPVRIPHWDOREMHFWVKDYHHOHFWURQVLQWKHLURXWHUVKHOO
that can be fairly easily ripped away by interactions with light, but 

145
only under certain conditions. Those conditions, and how much 
energy they have when they are ripped away, are consistent with 
light being made 
of particles and are 
inconsistent 
with 
it having wavelike 
properties. Why?
x
Shine a light on a 
piece of metal and 
measure the energy 
of 
the 
electrons 
that are given off. 
If light is a wave, 
then the brighter 
the light is, the 
more energy you 
would expect the electrons to have. Why? If light is a wave, then 
brighter lights would emit higher-amplitude waves, which would 
have more energy, and waves with more energy would kick off 
electrons with more energy. 
x
However, this is not what happens. Whether electrons are given 
off at all has nothing to do with the brightness of the light, but 
has everything to do with the color. In addition, the energy of the 
electrons given off is also determined by the color of the light. The 
higher up on the spectrum the color is, the higher the energy the 
emitted electrons have. 
x
If light is a wave, a brighter light would mean that waves with larger 
amplitude and energy would produce higher-energy electrons, but 
what actually happens is exactly what we would expect if light is 
made of particles‚Äîwhat are now known as photons.
x
If light is made of particles, light lower in the spectrum would have 
particles with less energy. But once the spectrum of light reaches 
a certain point, such that the amount of energy in each photon is 
Experiments have shown that light has a dual 
nature: It is both a wave and a particle.

greater than the force holding the electron in place, the photons will

have enough energy to counteract it, the energy of those electrons 
will be really low. But as the light moves up the spectrum, the 
photons get more energy, so they kick off those electrons with more 
force, and thus, the electrons have a higher energy. 
x
Making the light brighter increases the number of photons and, 
therefore, increases the number of electrons ripped away, but 
making the light brighter does not change the color, and thus, it 
does not change the photons‚Äô energy. Therefore, the energy of the 
electrons emitted also remains unchanged.
x
In short, if light is made of waves, then the energy of the electrons 
would be determined by the light‚Äôs brightness. If it is made of 
particles, then it would be determined by its color. Because it‚Äôs 
determined by its color, light is made of particles.
x
So, the two-slit experiment shows that light is a wave; the 
photoelectric effect shows that it is a particle. This is the wave-
particle duality of light. It seems to be both. But the problem is that 
the properties of waves and particles are inconsistent. If light were 
made of particles, it would behave a different way in the two-slit 
experiment. If it were made of waves, it would behave a different 
way than it does in the photoelectric effect experiment. So, it seems 
that it can‚Äôt be both, but it is.

Why can‚Äôt it be both? Why can‚Äôt light consist of particles that are 
riding on waves, like little surfers? Wouldn‚Äôt that explain both 
H[SHULPHQWV" 7KH SKRWRQV ULGLQJ RQ WKH ZDYHV FRXOG HMHFW WKH
electrons from the metal, but the waves in which they are riding 
could interfere with each other in the two-slit experiment. A very 
sophisticated version of this theory was developed by the theoretical 
physicist David Bohm, whose version might work, but this simple 
‚Äúsurfer‚Äù solution doesn‚Äôt work.

Suppose that we set up an experiment where we shine a light through 
ZKDWSK\VLFLVWVFDOODKDOIVLOYHUHGPLUURUZKLFKLVDFWXDOO\MXVWDQ
ordinary two-way mirror, like the ones you see in the interrogation 
room in cop shows. When you shine the light through it, it splits the 
light wave in half, and half of the photons emitted from the light 
ZLOOUH√ÄHFWRIIWKHPLUURUDQGKDOIRIWKHPZLOOJRWKURXJKLW:H
then set up two additional regular mirrors, one on either side at a 
GLVWDQFHDQGDQDQJOHWRWKHWZRZD\PLUURU7KH\ZLOOUH√ÄHFWERWK
streams of light to a single location on a distant wall. 
x
So, a particular photon might travel through the two-way mirror, 
ERXQFHRIIWKHPLUURURQWKHOHIWDQGKLWWKHZDOORULWPLJKWUH√ÄHFW
off the two-way mirror, bounce off the mirror on the right, and then 
KLW WKH ZDOO7KH REMHFWLYHSUREDELOLW\ RI DQ\ SDUWLFXODU SKRWRQ¬∂V
path is 50-50. There is no way to determine beforehand which path 
it will take.
x
If we turn on the light with both regular mirrors in place, we will 
get an interference pattern. If we take either one of those mirrors 
away, we will get a noninterference pattern‚Äîbasically, a single dot. 
And this is all true no matter how dim we make the light. Let‚Äôs 
say that we put a photoreceptive cell on the wall that is sensitive 
enough to record even one photon, and we turn the light down so 
dim and turn it on and off so quickly that it only emits one photon.
x
If we do this once a day, every day, for a year, with both regular 
mirrors up every time, we will get an interference pattern. This 
makes sense on the surfer theory. Even if only one photon is being 
emitted, the light wave would still divide at the two-way mirror, 
ERWK KDOYHV RI LW ZRXOG UH√ÄHFW RII HLWKHU PLUURU DQG WKH\ ZRXOG
reunite before they hit the wall and interfere with each other.
x
If we do one photon a day every day for a year but with only one 
of the regular mirrors up, we will get a noninterference pattern‚Äîa 
dot. Again, this makes sense. Subtracting one of the regular mirrors 
would prevent one half of the light wave from reaching the wall, so 
it couldn‚Äôt interfere with its other half. 

148
Lecture 21: Quantum Mechanics and Wave-Particle Duality
x
But we have no way of knowing, if we leave both regular mirrors 
up, what path any particular photon took to get to the wall‚Äîwhich 
half of the wave had the photon. Did it go through the two-way 
PLUURUDQGWDNHWKHOHIWSDWKRUGLGLWUH√ÄHFWRIIRILWDQGWDNHWKH
right? We have no idea. 
x
So, suppose we put very sensitive detectors on the two mirrors so 
that we can tell which mirror suffers an impact and, thus, which 
PLUURUUH√ÄHFWHGDSKRWRQ:HFRXOGWKHQWHOOZKLFKSDWKWKHSKRWRQ
took in each case.
x
,I ZH GLG WKDW DQG WKH VXUIHU K\SRWKHVLV LV ULJKW¬≤OLJKW LV MXVW
photons traveling on light waves‚Äîthen we should see no change 
in the pattern on the wall. Both halves of the light wave would still 
reach the wall by bouncing off both regular mirrors and interfere 
with each other. We would simply know which half of the light 
wave contains the photon. 
x
But that is not what happens. If we make that measurement and 
determine which path the photon takes, even though we left both 
regular mirrors up, the interference pattern disappears. If we did 
that every day for a year, we would end up with two noninterference 
patterns‚Äîbasically, two dots‚Äîone created by the photons that took 
the left path, and one created by the photons that took the right path. 
x
As long as we are not measuring the light for particle properties, 
it has wavelike properties, so we get an interference pattern. But 
as soon as we measure for the particle, we make it take on particle 
properties, all the wave properties of the light disappear, and we 
lose the interference pattern. This is what quantum physicists  
think happens.
x
In a way, this is helpful. Wave and particle properties are 
incompatible, so light can‚Äôt have both at once. And it doesn‚Äôt. It has 
particle properties under some conditions, and it has wave properties 
under others, but never both at once. Light has a dual nature.

149
x
Double-slit experiments with over 100 kinds of particles have been 
conducted, even with atoms themselves, and we always get an 
interference pattern. In fact, we have even done it with molecules 
that contain up to 114 atoms‚Äîand we still get an inference pattern. 
So, it looks like quantum mechanics is not only about the atomic 
and subatomic world; it seems that all matter in the universe has a 
wave-particle duality.

ave and particle properties are incompatible, but quantum 
mechanics suggests that quantum particles have wavelike 
properties until they are measured, in which case they take on 
particle properties. This is a metaphysical conclusion because it tells us about 
the nature of matter. But quantum mechanics doesn‚Äôt stop there. It turns 
out that certain particle-like properties, such as location and momentum, 
are mathematically incompatible on the quantum level. It‚Äôs impossible for 
a quantum particle to have both location and momentum at the same time. 
This is called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and it was discovered by 
Werner Heisenberg.

It‚Äôs not as if an electron has both position and momentum but we 
can only determine one property at a time. It‚Äôs that it can only have 
one of those properties at a time. In addition, it doesn‚Äôt have either 
one of those properties until we measure for it‚Äîuntil we collapse 
the wave into a particle.
x
If an electron is not being measured, it has neither location nor 
momentum. We can lay down probabilities for how likely it is that 
it would take on a particular location if we measured it, but if we 
are not measuring it, it has no location. The probabilities we are 
WDONLQJDERXWDUHQRWVXEMHFWLYH¬≤WKH\DUHREMHFWLYH7KHUHLVDIDFW
about how likely it would be in a particular location if measured, 
but there is no fact about where it actually is; it has no location 
unless measured. The same is true for momentum.

151
x
The way quantum physicists describe the electron when it is not 
being measured is as a probabilistic wave function. It‚Äôs a wave 
that contains information about how probable certain particle-like 
properties, such as momentum and location, are. The term for this is 
superposition, which basically means that the many possible states 
the electron could be in coexist. 
x
Physicists say that an electron is in a superposition of not having 
any particular location or momentum, but certain locations and 
momentums are more probable. There are facts about what location 
or momentum the electron would likely take on if measured, and 
those probabilistic facts are a part of the world. These are, in the

physicists couldn‚Äôt accept that it suggested that events are uncaused 
and that certain properties are not had by quantum particles until 
they are measured. There must be some hidden information‚Äîa 
hidden variable‚Äîthat determines such things. Along with 
Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, Einstein proposed a thought 
experiment, called the EPR experiment, and attempted to show that 
there must be hidden variables.
x
The property of spin is one of those properties that quantum 
mechanics says that a quantum particle does not take on until you 
measure for it. To be clear, subatomic particles don‚Äôt actually spin‚Äî
WKH\MXVWKDYHFHUWDLQHOHFWURPDJQHWLFSURSHUWLHVWKDWPDNHWKHP
behave, in certain circumstances, as if they were spinning. You can

one possible axis. 
x
According to quantum mechanics, before it is measured, a 
subatomic particle has indeterminate spin. It is equally likely that 
it is spinning on any axis‚Äîa vertical axis, a horizontal axis, or any 
number of diagonal axes‚Äîand for any axis it could be spinning on, 
each direction it could be spinning on that axis is equally likely. 

152
Lecture 22: Quantum Mechanics, Spin, and Spooky Action
x
Einstein and his colleagues believed that the particles must have a 
spin before being measured. Let‚Äôs say that you have an atom that 
has zero spin. But then it gives off two particles, each of which 
has nonzero spin, and the two particles speed off in opposite 
directions. This actually happens in nature all the time. We know 
that the spin the two particles have will always be opposite. If one 
has a vertical-up spin, the other one will have a vertical-down spin. 
This is undeniable and uncontested. Spin is always conserved. If 
what quantum mechanics says is true, which of the two particles 
has spin up and which one has spin down is indeterminate until a 
measurement is made. 
x
Einstein and his colleagues suggested that it can‚Äôt be the case that 
particles are taking on a spin at the moment of measurement. The 
particles must have a spin before they are measured. Otherwise, 
there is this ‚Äúspooky action at a distance‚Äù that violates relativity. 
Basically, at the moment they are emitted, the particles must take 
on a spin, and they merely demonstrate that spin when they travel 
through a measuring device. Their spin must merely be hidden‚Äîa 
hidden variable. 
x
Einstein was wrong about something: There can‚Äôt be hidden 
variables; thus, the particles can‚Äôt have a spin until they are 
measured. Irish physicist John Bell proved it mathematically, 
although, ironically, he was trying to prove Einstein right. 
x
Quantum mechanics and Einstein‚Äôs hidden variable theory give 
us two different predictions. In quantum mechanics, the particles 
don‚Äôt have a spin until they are measured, but we can represent 
the relationship between their spins mathematically. In quantum 
mechanics, the probability that particle B will spin opposite particle 
A when they are being measured on axes that differ by 120¬∞ is 25%. 
x
But in the hidden variable theory, the probability is that they will be 
opposite at least 33% of the time. Without even performing Bell‚Äôs 
version of the experiment, we know that the hidden variable theory 
is incompatible with quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics 

153
dictates a 25% probability, but the hidden variable hypothesis 
predicts at least 33%. 
x
What‚Äôs even more damning for the hidden variable theory is that 
you can actually perform this experiment in the real world, and 
the two theories make completely different predictions about what 
you will observe. Physicist Alain Aspect did the experiment in the 
early 1980s, and it turned out to be 25%. Thus, the hidden variable 
theory is defeated; quantum particles do not have spin until they  
are measured.

What are we to make, metaphysically, out of particles not having 
spin, location, or momentum until they are measured? What are 
we to make of the fact that they are in a superposition such that

there‚Äôs not universal agreement about what it amounts to even 
among those who subscribe to it. 
x
It begins by admitting that quantum mechanics is complete. There 
are not any hidden variables that assign a particular spin or location 
to quantum particles when they‚Äôre not being observed; particles 
really are in a superposition. But when we do make observations, 
the superpositions collapse into particles that take on what we 
might call classical properties, properties derived from classical

have, like location.

x
If we stopped there and embraced the idea that wave functions can 
exist, even without classical properties, we could now understand 
a number of things that previously might have seemed unclear, 
including how particles can pop into existence from nothing. So, if 
we don‚Äôt press further, quantum mechanics does give us knowledge 
of the way the universe is‚Äîthere are facts about the probabilistic 
properties that wave functions have. 
x
But those who subscribe to the Copenhagen interpretation have 
very instrumentalist tendencies. Instrumentalism in philosophy

way reality is, but are merely useful tools for making predictions. 
Most who push the Copenhagen interpretation push this view. 
They suggests that theorizing the existence of wave functions is a 
useful tool for making predictions about experimental results, but it 
doesn‚Äôt actually tell us the way the world is. This is disappointing to 
say the least‚Äîwe want to know the way the world is‚Äîbut there are 
also a few problems with it.
x
First, those who suggest this seem to be doing so only because 
they don‚Äôt like the description that quantum mechanics gives of 
reality. Another problem is that this view was motivated by logical 
positivism‚Äîthe idea that statements are only meaningful if they 
FDQEHREVHUYDWLRQDOO\FRQ¬øUPHG
Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Cat
x
Another problem is exposed by the famous Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat 
thought experiment. Take a cat that‚Äôs been given a sleeping pill 
so that it can‚Äôt make any conscious observations, and put it in a 
box. Attach that box to a device that could emit poisonous gas into 
the box, and attach that to a device that can measure the spin of 
particles, but don‚Äôt let it display its result to us. Hook it up so that if 
the device registers a spin up, the gas will release, but if it measures 
D VSLQ GRZQ LW ZRQ¬∂W7KHQ LQMHFW D SDUWLFOH ZLWK LQGHWHUPLQDWH
spin into the measuring device. 

155
x
The spin of the particle is indeterminate until we measure it, and 
because the measuring device doesn‚Äôt display its result, it will 
remain in a superposition, and thus, the particle‚Äôs spin will be 
indeterminate. It will be indeterminate whether the gas was released 
and, therefore, indeterminate whether the cat is alive or dead. 
x
And if quantum theory doesn‚Äôt tell us facts about the way the 
world is, but is merely a useful tool, then there is no fact about 
whether the cat is alive or dead. But this is absurd‚Äîthere must be 
a fact about whether or not the cat is alive or dead, so there must 
be something wrong with the instrumentalist‚Äôs leanings of the  
Copenhagen interpretation.

of wave functions describe reality, Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat still raises 
problems. What could it mean for it to be a fact of reality that the 
cat is in an indeterminate state of aliveness and deadness? We think 
we can make some sense of what it means for an electron to be a

probabilistic wave function, but what would it mean for a cat to be 
a probabilistic wave function?
x
Then, it gets even weirder. If we opened the box, we will see either 
a dead or alive cat‚Äîthat will be our measurement that makes the 
wave function collapse. This is similar to when we observed which 
mirror the photon hit in the two-way mirror experiment, which 
caused the wave function to collapse. But what‚Äôs so special about 
observation? How can observation change reality like this‚Äîhow 
can it collapse a wave function?
x
Some have thought to solve this problem by suggesting that it‚Äôs not 
observation but interaction with the measuring device that causes 
the wave function to collapse. So, in the Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat example, 
the spin-measuring device collapses the wave function into a 
particle with a particular spin, even though we didn‚Äôt know which 
one. Thus, there was a fact about what spin it had and, thus, a fact 
about whether the cat was alive or dead. 
x
The problem is that we can prove experimentally that interactions 
with measuring devices don‚Äôt collapse wave functions; to collapse 
it, the results of measurements have to be observed. What is so 
special about observation? This is called the measurement problem, 
and it and problems like it have given rise to many different 
interpretations of quantum mechanics.

alternative interpretations to quantum mechanics. In this lecture, you will 
consider a few on the way to exploring the possibility that our universe is not

as a multiverse. 
7KH3LORW:DYH7KHRU\
x
One of the alternatives to the Copenhagen interpretation is the 
consciousness interpretation, which suggests that‚Äîbecause 
conscious observation seems necessary for quantum particles to 
take on certain properties‚Äîsomehow the conscious event in our 
mind of our being aware of a quantum measurement collapses the 
wave function. So, in the EPR experiment, our mind causes the 
particle to take on a spin, although we have no conscious control 
over what spin it takes. Some misunderstand quantum mechanics 
and think that this is exactly what the theory must entail, but this is 
only an interpretation, and there are many problems with it.
x
First, it not only assumes the existence of the mind, which is 
problematic to account for, but it also assumes that the mind can not 
only affect our bodies, but also affect quantum events. In addition, 
it commits us to thinking that Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat is neither alive nor 
dead until our observation collapses the wave function‚Äîbut this 
is quite unintuitive. Lastly, if conscious observation is required to 
collapse a wave function, what was the universe like before there 
were conscious observers? 

159
x
This has caused some to hypothesize God as a conscious observer 
outside the system whose observations can cause wave functions to

then he or she knows and observes all, so all wave functions would 
be collapsed at all times‚Äîyet we know that they are not. To be 
consistent with quantum mechanics, one would have to suggest that 
God only observes and collapses the wave functions that we need to 
say are collapsed even though there is no observer around. Once we

David Bohm proposed a theory of quantum mechanics that is 
basically a souped-up version of the particle surfer theory, which 
suggested that particles exist, but they ‚Äúride‚Äù on waves, and how 
the waves affect the motions of the particle could explain things 
like interference patterns in the two-slit experiments. Bohm 
suggests that both particles and waves exist and that waves guide 
the particles. 
x
But Bohm‚Äôs theory is different in a few ways. First, Bohm‚Äôs waves 
aren‚Äôt waves per se, but a ‚Äúquantum force.‚Äù Second, the particles 
don‚Äôt ride the force but are piloted by them. The analogy that Bohm 
uses is a radio beacon guiding a ship. Third, Bohm suggests that the 
same equations that describe how quantum wave functions develop 
describe how the quantum force guides the particles. Combine that 
with our ignorance of the initial locations of particles before they 
are affected by the quantum force, and Bohm‚Äôs theory makes all the 
same predictions that traditional quantum mechanics makes. 
x
The surfer theory faced a problem: In the two-way mirror 
experiment, simply measuring the path of the particle makes the 
interference pattern disappear. How can Bohm‚Äôs pilot wave theory 
account for this? Bohm‚Äôs quantum force is not local; it does not

time. Events on one end of the EPR experiment‚Äîmeasuring along 
a certain axis and the particle getting a spin‚Äîcan affect the force 
and particle on the other end. 

160
Lecture 23: Quantum Mechanics, God, and the Multiverse
x
But here is where Bohm runs into a problem. First, it‚Äôs still not clear 
how an observation could cause such things to happen. Second, this 
would happen instantaneously, even if these locations or particles 
were light-years apart. Thus, it would seem that information about 
the quantum force in one location can travel faster than the speed 
of light to another location. Some argue that this violates the rule 
in relativity that nothing can travel faster than light, but others 
deny this.

The most famous multiple universe theory is called the many-
worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and it was developed 
by physicist Hugh Everett and later endorsed by Bryce DeWitt. 
A possible world is a reality that coheres to a logically consistent 
truth arrangement of all possible propositions. The proposition 
‚Äúa multiverse exists‚Äù could be true or false in many possible 
combinations, so there are many possible worlds that are 
multiverses. There is also a possible world with one universe, with 
two, with three, etc. What we are wondering is whether the actual 
world is a multiverse, and what Everett suggests is that it is. 
x
Furthermore, a universe is a collection of matter that is causally 
interrelated, but causally closed. For any given piece of matter in a 
universe, it can necessarily only causally interact with other pieces 
of matter in that same universe. (Although, events in one universe 
might create another.) 
x
Something that is really weird about quantum mechanics is the 
collapse of the wave function, and it‚Äôs not clear how an observation 
of a quantum outcome could make it happen. Everett suggests that 
it doesn‚Äôt. Your observation of the wave function doesn‚Äôt collapse 
it; it makes you part of it. To account for what your observation 
does, you have to plug yourself in as a variable into the quantum 
equation. So, you are now in a superposition; thus, you have 
PXOWLSOH FRQWUDGLFWRU\ SURSHUWLHV DW RQFH MXVW OLNH WKH ZDYH
function. You are in a state of both having observed the particle as 
having spin up and having observed the particle as spin down. 

161
x
But, of course, ‚Äúyou‚Äù are only aware of one of the outcomes. How 
can you also be aware of the other one? It would seem that this can 
be true only if you are split in two so that there is another ‚Äúyou‚Äù 
that observes the other outcome. And it seems that the only way 
that could happen is if there is another universe with another you 
that observes the other possible outcome. So, it was suggested that 
Everett‚Äôs idea entailed that human observations of measurements 
of quantum events create multiple universes. The two ‚Äúyous‚Äù in the 
two universes can‚Äôt interact; they are not even aware of the other 
one‚Äôs existence. But they are still there.

We have now considered three interpretations of quantum 
mechanics: the Copenhagen interpretation, the pilot wave theory, 
and the many-worlds interpretation. Basically, we can think that the 
mind has inexplicable ability to cause wave functions to collapse 
on the quantum level by observing measurements, that information 
can travel faster than the speed of light or backward in time, or that 
there are multiple universes. The multiple universe theory is the 
only one that doesn‚Äôt violate the laws of physics, and because the

existence of multiple universes. There are also theological reasons. 
In fact, the existence of God might itself suggest the existence of 
the multiverse. Many theists have started to suggest that God must 
have created a multiverse as a way to avoid a philosophical problem 
with theistic belief raised by a philosopher named William Rowe.
x
Rowe articulates what is called the problem of no best world, which 
JRHVOLNHWKLV*RGLIKHRUVKHH[LVWVPXVWE\GH¬øQLWLRQDOZD\V
do the best possible thing. So, if God created our reality, then he or 
she must‚Äôve created the best possible one‚Äîthe best possible world. 
We could stop there, and we already have a problem: This world is 
obviously not the best possible world. But Rowe goes deeper.

Not only is this not the best possible world, but the very concept of a 
best possible world is logically problematic. For any given possible 
world that there could be, you could always make that possible world

to make the concept of the greatest possible world coherent. They 
attempted to do so with this suggestion. It‚Äôs true that for any possible

But suppose that God created

created a multiverse where 
each universe was better

However, because if God exists he or she must create the best 
possible world, creating a multiverse would be the only way of 
doing so. So, if you think God exists, then you must think that there 
are multiple universes. 
x
This argument is not without its hiccups. The theist who believes 
in the multiverse‚Äîa multiverse theist‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt think that God 
would create all possible universes. Some possible universes would 
be worse than hell, and an all-loving God wouldn‚Äôt create such a

The existence of our mental life, our mentality, is dependent on and 
produced by the activity of our neurons. It is because the neurons 
RIRXUEUDLQDUHZLUHGDQG¬øUHLQFHUWDLQZD\VWKDWZHKDYHWKH
sensations that we do. Everything is produced by the activity of 
our brain, and all of our mental life‚Äîour thoughts, beliefs, and 
decisions‚Äîare reactions to what we experience.
x
But the reason that we have the sensations that we do is because 
our organs send electrical signals to our brain. Think into the future, 
when we completely understand how the brain works and how it 
LQWHUSUHWVWKHVLJQDOVVHQWWRLW6XSSRVHWKDWSHRSOHFRXOGKLMDFN
all of your senses and hook their computer directly into your brain. 
They could control everything you see, hear, feel, taste, and smell. 
They could create an entire world for you to experience. We could 
call such a device an experience machine. This is actually the plot 
RIWKHSRSXODUVFL¬øFODVVLFThe Matrix. 
x
To understand the computer simulation hypothesis, we also need to

activity of your neurons could be replicated on a computer‚Äîon a 
large, advanced, and complex enough silicon hard drive. In addition, 
because we don‚Äôt know what is required for consciousness‚Äîand, 

167
VSHFL¬øFDOO\ZHGRQ¬∂WNQRZWKDWEHLQJPDGHRXWRIFDUERQLQVWHDG
of silicon is required for consciousness‚Äîit seems that we should 
conclude that if the neural functioning of our brains were replicated 
on a computer, that activity on the computer would give rise to 
consciousness. It would have a mind.
x
Recall also that we might not need to copy an existing person‚Äôs

use multiple techniques to produce a new, unique mind, one

mind the way that an infant‚Äôs

Because its silicon neurons

world. Even if it were to look at its own brain, and study it, if we 
were to send the exact same kind of signals that we receive when 
we study our brain, it would even think that it had a carbon-based 
biological brain, even though it has a silicon one.

minds. They could walk about this digital world and experience it 
as if it were a real physical world. In fact, they would even think 
that it is a physical world. That is a computer-simulated world.
x
There are so many reasons why we would do this. Historians

addition, simulated worlds would make great video games.

Philosopher Nick Bostrom argues that the likelihood that we 
ourselves live in a computer simulation is directly proportional to 
the probability that we will one day develop computer simulations 
ourselves. Here‚Äôs why it is way more likely than you thought that 
we actually live in a computer simulation. First, if there ever is a 
VLPXODWHGZRUOGWKHUHZRQ¬∂WEHMXVWRQH¬≤WKHUHZLOOEHELOOLRQV,W
ZLOOEHDPDMRUDGYDQFHLQWHFKQRORJ\DQGLWZLOOOLNHO\EHXVHGIRU
many reasons. 
x
A safe assumption to make is that there actually is a physical universe. 
If so, there are two possibilities. Either the physical universe is one in 
which computer-simulated worlds are never developed anywhere, or 
they are developed and there are billions of them. 
x
Because we haven‚Äôt yet developed simulated worlds, we don‚Äôt know 
ZKLFKRSWLRQLVDFWXDOO\WKHFDVH¬≤ZKHWKHUWKHUHLVMXVWDSK\VLFDO
world, or there is a physical world with billions of simulated worlds 
in it. But if we ever develop a computer-simulated world ourselves, 
ZHZLOONQRZWKDWWKH¬øUVWRSWLRQLVQRWWUXHEHFDXVHZHFUHDWHGD
simulated world. Therefore, if we ever create a simulated world, we 
would know that the physical universe that exists contains billions 
of simulated ones.
x
Then, how would we know what kind of universe we are in? Are we 
in the physical world, or are we in one of the billions of computer-
simulated worlds? Computer-simulated worlds would look to their 

169
LQKDELWDQWVMXVWOLNHSK\VLFDOZRUOGV7KHRQO\WKLQJZHZRXOGKDYH
to go on is the odds, and the odds are that we are in a simulated 
world. It‚Äôs a billion-to-one chance that we are in the physical world.
x
So, if we ever create a computer-simulated world, we will know 
that there is one physical world and billions of simulated ones, so 
the odds that we are in a simulated world are a near guarantee. So, 
if we ever create a computer-simulated world, it‚Äôs a near guarantee 
that we are in one‚Äîso, we should conclude that we are.
x
The probability that we live in a computer-simulated world 
is directly proportional to the probability that we will create 
a simulated world. So, how likely is it that we would create a 
VLPXODWHGZRUOG"7KHUHDUHEDVLFDOO\¬øYHSRVVLELOLWLHV2QHUHDVRQ
that we might never create a simulated world is that we might 
destroy our civilization in some way before we ever become that 
technologically advanced. In addition, ethical considerations might 
SUHYHQWXVIURPGRLQJVR$GGLWLRQDOO\ZHPLJKWMXVWORVHLQWHUHVW
in creating computer-simulated worlds. Furthermore, there might 
simply be technological limitations that prevent us from creating 
computer-simulated worlds. Finally, there is the possibility that we 
actually could and will develop computer-simulated worlds.
x
We don‚Äôt know which scenario is most likely, and we really have no 
reliable information to make such a prediction. But when you are 
ZRUNLQJZLWKVXEMHFWLYHSUREDELOLWLHVDODFNRILQIRUPDWLRQGRHV
not prevent you from laying down probabilities. If you have no 
information to make one hypothesis more likely than the other, then 
\RXMXVWJLYHHDFKK\SRWKHVLVDQHTXDOSUREDELOLW\%HFDXVHWKHUH
DUH¬øYHWKDWZRXOGPHDQWKDWHDFKVFHQDULRLVSHUFHQWOLNHO\
x
But that means that it is 20 percent likely that we will one day create 
computer-simulated worlds. However, if we one day do that, it will 
be a near guarantee that we live in a computer-simulated world. So, 
we are forced to conclude that, given what we know, the probability 
that we live in a computer-simulated world is 20 percent. Now, 
that‚Äôs not enough to conclude that it actually is true that we live in 

170
Lecture 24: Do We Live in a Computer Simulation?
a computer-simulated world, but that probability is probably much 
KLJKHUWKDQ\RXWKRXJKW,W¬∂VQRWMXVWDORJLFDOSRVVLELOLW\WKDWFDQ¬∂W
be 100 percent disproven; there‚Äôs actually a decent chance that  
it‚Äôs true.
x
Some people have said that they have seen ‚Äúglitches‚Äù that indicate 
that we are in a computer-simulated world. This seems unlikely. 
Even if the world is real, our senses aren‚Äôt very reliable‚Äîand, after 
DOOWKHGHVLJQHURIRXUXQLYHUVHFRXOGDOZD\VMXVWHUDVHRXUPHPRU\
of such glitches if he or she wanted to. 
x
One fascinating argument that suggests that we live in a computer-
simulated world is based in quantum mechanics. The computing 
power to keep track of everything that would be happening in a 
universe the size of ours, all the way down to the quantum level‚Äî
where every particle is and how fast it‚Äôs moving‚Äîwould be 
enormous. But it would also be unnecessary. Only when we get 
sophisticated enough to start taking measurements at the quantum 
level would the computer need to bother with ascribing properties 
to quantum particles. 
x
But could this be why quantum particles don‚Äôt have certain 
properties until they are observed by us‚Äîbecause the computer 
doesn‚Äôt bother to give them properties until we observe them? Is 
this why they are a probabilistic wave function before they are 
observed‚Äîbecause the computer only bothers calculating where 
they would likely be if they are observed? Is this why mathematical 
equations are the best way to describe the quantum level‚Äîbecause 
UHDOO\LWMXVWLVDPDWKHPDWLFDOHTXDWLRQEHLQJUXQRQDFRPSXWHU",V
this why a particle can‚Äôt have both location and velocity at the same 
time‚Äîbecause the computer can only assign one at a time? 
x
What if we are living in a computer simulation? Interestingly, the 
point might be that it doesn‚Äôt matter. If you care about knowing 
the true nature of the world, it matters‚Äîso metaphysicians care. 
Science has already taught us that the universe is very different than 
what our common sense suggests, so the realization that the world 

171
is digital might not be that revolutionary. Ultimately, it might not 
matter for everyday life.
x
After all, even if we are simulated persons, we are still persons‚Äî
we are minded. We experience pain, have emotions, and thus have 
rights and obligations. If we live in a simulated world, we would 
still be bound by all the same moral rules. We should still behave 
exactly as we should behave.
x
In fact, if we have good reason to believe that we live in a computer 
simulation, perhaps the only way we should modify our behavior is 
by not talking about the fact that we live in a computer simulation. 
Whoever is running the computer simulation might only be 
interested in it as long as we don‚Äôt know that we‚Äôre in one. As soon 
as we know that we‚Äôre in one, he or she might lose interest and 
turn the whole thing off. So, by talking about this, you might be 
endangering your own existence. In fact, the existence of the entire 
universe could be at stake.
