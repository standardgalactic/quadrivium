About the Authors
Andrew Bell was an investment reporter and editor with The Globe and Mail 
for 12 years. He joined Business News Network as a reporter in 2001.
Bell, an import from Dublin, Ireland, was for 10 years the main compiler of 
Stars & Dogs in Saturday’s Globe. The roundup of hot and damp stocks and 
mutual funds was an invaluable therapeutic aid in relieving his own myriad 
jealousies, regrets, and resentments. He has also taken to the stage, where he 
practises a demanding “method” that involves getting the audience and other 
performers as off-balance and upset as possible.
He lives in Cabbagetown, Toronto, with his wife and daughter.
Matthew Elder is a writer and communications consultant based in Toronto. 
Previously he was vice-president, content and editorial, of Morningstar 
Canada. A Montreal native, he was a columnist and editor specializing in 
personal fi nance with The Gazette for 10 years before moving to the Financial 
Post in 1995, where he was mutual funds editor and columnist until joining 
Morningstar in 2000.
Matthew lives and works out of a Toronto condo tower, and frequently 
takes his trade (and recreation) to family retreats on Georgian Bay and the 
Laurentians. He is married to a fi nancial planner and has two twentysome-
thing sons.


Acknowledgements
Andrew thanks his colleagues for their support and indulgence, especially 
Eric Reguly, Lori Vanden Bergh, Steve Northfield, Mike Den Tandt, and Dave 
Pyette. His wife, Tara Ellis, cheerfully put up with months of whining, pro-
crastination, and self-pity. And so did talented editors Joan Whitman and 
Melanie Rutledge. Thanks also to Ellen Roseman, who first got Andrew writ-
ing about funds.
Matthew is grateful for valuable input and assistance from a variety of 
experts. Foremost among them were Morningstar analysts David O’Leary, 
Brian O’Neil, and Mark Chow, who put together the lists of Dummies 
Approved funds that are scattered across various chapters. Matthew is 
grateful to Rudy Luukko, whose encyclopedic knowledge of the funds indus-
try was tapped frequently. A special thank you to Scott Mackenzie, CEO of 
Morningstar, for supplying us with reams of data, gleaned mostly from the 
fi rm’s invaluable PALTrak desktop software, with interpretive help from 
Anastasia Aulsebrook, Tom Teder, and John Campea. Thanks, too, to the 
Investment Funds Institute of Canada for permission to excerpt some of their 
extensive industry data. There was much appreciated input from The Globe 
and Mail’s Rob Carrick, the dean of Canadian personal fi nance writers. Input 
from Moshe Milevsky of York University, Malcolm Hamilton, senior actuary 
at Mercer, and veteran independent mutual fund analyst Dan Hallett was 
also greatly appreciated. Thanks to Robert Hickey and Lindsay Humphreys 
of Wiley, and to Kelli Howey for her copy editing. Perhaps most important, 
Matthew is grateful to his wife and fi nancial adviser Jane Baker for putting up 
with months of silly questions and incessant complaining.

Introduction
M
utual funds have been a target of criticism over the years. The rap is 
that their fees are too high, they don’t do any better than the market 
as a whole, and you get sold stuff you don’t want — or, worse, stuff that’s 
inappropriate to your financial needs. In some individual cases, those criti-
cisms can be true.
Many funds are overpriced; in other words, their annual charges, often used 
to pay the very people who sell you funds, are too high to allow you to end 
up with a decent return. Many funds are little better than marketing ploys, 
and still more just drag their hapless customers through years of lousy 
returns.
But, despite it all, mutual funds work. And they work well. Conservative funds 
that invested in quality stocks and bonds — and cautious investors who 
made sure they didn’t risk all their money in stocks — have achieved decent 
long-term returns. But here’s the great part: Picking conservative funds with 
good returns and putting them together in a smart financial plan isn’t that 
hard or time-consuming. Just follow the simple (and often obvious) guide-
lines in this book, and you’ll do fine.
Life is short and we’re all overloaded. So much mud-wrestling, so little time. 
We’ve written Mutual Fund Investing For Canadians For Dummies as though 
we’re sitting with you in a coffee shop giving you the basic facts on mutual 
funds and investing — only the essential stuff you need to earn a decent 
return on your money. We hope you never feel, while reading this book, that 
we’re droning on about something that doesn’t affect your life. Most people 
relegate mutual funds to the grey parking lot of their lives that’s reserved for 
stuff like plumbing or Kansas — something to think about if you have to, but 
otherwise no thanks. That’s a pity; funds really can make a difference in your 
financial picture.
They aren’t very complicated, either — a mutual fund is really just a handy 
invention that allows hordes of people to pool their cash into a profession-
ally managed investment vehicle that handles the bookkeeping. It then buys 
things such as shares in companies and bonds issued by governments, things 
that a lot of ordinary people find confusing. Funds are so powerful and simple 
that they’ve helped to transform the economy of the capitalist world.

2
Mutual Fund Investing For Canadians For Dummies 
Until the mass-market mutual fund came along, investing in shares and 
buying bonds was mostly a privilege of the rich, just like tax evasion and dull 
conversations about the unreliability of nannies. These days, mutual funds 
have helped millions of ordinary people, especially in North America, to 
gather unprecedented wealth.
This book is meant to help you be part of that phenomenon. With a little edu-
cation, you too can jump on the bandwagon and make yourself some cold, 
hard cash. Getting up to speed about mutual funds doesn’t take long and it 
can be sinfully profitable. For more and more Canadians — especially the 
self-employed or those working for small companies — the returns they get 
from their funds will determine when they can stop working and what kind of 
retirement income to expect.
How This Book Is Different
Pick up nearly any book or article about investing and you’ll probably see a 
picture of the author — a fresh-faced thing with cute tousled hair or a solemn 
corrupt senator-type trying to look prosperous. Oh, nothing’s more glamor-
ous than the hectic, glittering life of the investment author!
And then every book has its promises: The special formulas, the daring analy-
ses, the hinted-at guarantee that at last you’ve found the route to riches. But 
what we all-knowing money gurus rarely get around to explaining is: How 
come, if we’re such fantastic investors, we have to do something as wretched 
as write a book? Why aren’t we striding the trading floor at RBC Dominion 
Securities, barking orders over a cell phone at quivering central bankers, and 
restructuring the automobile industry before lunch?
The evidence shows that hardly anybody, including the investment profes-
sional, is consistently good at picking shares and bonds that go up in price. 
Despite all the fancy talk and arcane theories, stock and bond prices move in 
unpredictable patterns — like the weather or the population of porcupines in 
New Brunswick.
So yeah, we admit it: This book contains no magic, just some plain logic and 
simple facts you could find out for yourself by fooling around with mutual 
funds for a few years. But lots of people don’t have the time or inclination to 
do that — this book is for you, folks.
Besides, the investment market can be an awfully expensive place to learn 
investing lessons. So read on, and gain the benefit of our (often painful) 
experiences.

 Introduction
About the Information 
in This Book
Markets are in a state of constant movement, and the statistics that tell inves-
tors how well they’re doing change continually. With mutual funds you don’t 
need to keep an eye on their performance quite as closely as you would if you 
invested in individual stocks, because equity funds are diversified, longer-
term investments. However, knowing what your rate of return has been over 
time, and how that compares to other funds and the relevant benchmark 
(such as the Standard & Poor’s/Toronto Stock Exchange composite index) 
can be useful. For this reason we include numerous examples of fund perfor-
mance in this book, using data provided by Morningstar, the world’s leading 
source of investment fund data. This means we had to choose a point in time 
to capture this data — we selected June 30, 2008, and in most cases we refer 
to this date as “mid-2008.”
In most cases, we use data for the median mutual fund in a particular cat-
egory. As we explain in Chapter 2, a median value provides a more useful 
snapshot of a particular group of funds because it represents the midpoint 
between the highest and lowest values. A simple average, which is frequently 
used elsewhere to track asset-class performance, is often misleading because 
the smaller funds in the group have the same impact on the average value as 
larger funds.
Mutual fund medians exclude the impact of segregated funds, which are the 
same as mutual funds except they include a guarantee of part or all of your 
original investment. Segregated funds’ higher annual fees (due to the guar-
antee, which brings with it the extra cost of insurance) can have an unfairly 
negative impact on a category’s median return. (See Chapter 19 for more on 
seg funds, as they’re known.) In some cases where it seems useful to do so, 
we provide overall median values that include both types of funds.
When describing the size of the Canadian fund industry, in most cases we use 
total assets data from the Investment Funds Institute of Canada References. 
However, IFIC’s data reflect only the figures supplied by its members, which 
excludes not only insurance companies’ seg funds but also some mutual fund 
companies, which for one reason or another have decided not to join IFIC. 
(An important example of the latter is CI Funds, which had more than $60 bil-
lion in mutual fund assets as of mid-2008.) Nonetheless, IFIC’s numbers pro-
vide an excellent representation of the fund industry’s size and activity.

How This Book Is Organized
The best first move is to look at the table of contents to get an idea of what’s 
here. If you already know the basics, just jump to the topics you have trouble 
with. In the case of subjects with lots of further complications, like official 
rules and so on, we give you Web addresses so you can do further reading.
Think of the book as being like a set of Russian dolls, nesting inside each 
other. The smallest doll is Chapter 1, What Is a Mutual Fund? If you’re not 
quite clear on the basics of investing in funds, you can read that chapter and 
get all the truly important information. It’s designed to be a brief primer that 
gives you the essential core of mutual fund investing. The next level, provid-
ing more information on the drawbacks and advantages of funds, is Part I, 
which was written as a complete introduction to mutual funds. It provides 
more detail on each topic than we get into in Chapter 1. Then, to explore any 
aspect of funds in yet more depth, you can simply start jumping around the 
book. The whole thing is pretty flexible.
So don’t worry about reading every chapter. You should be out partying 
anyway. Jump right to the section you’re interested in, because each is 
understandable without reading others first. Throughout the book, we’ve 
avoided jargon wherever possible — where we’re forced to use a technical 
term, we explain it right away.
The sections that follow describe the parts in this book and what they cover.
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund
This first section is a summary of how funds work and the reasons to buy 
them, as well as what type to buy. Packed with definitions and plain-English 
explanations, this part is built for the novices who have been left scratching 
their heads about fund basics. You need to get your financial house in order 
before diving into the fund pool, so this part also features a crash course on 
financial planning and much, much more.
Part II: Buying Options: Looking 
for a Helping Hand
In Part II we walk through all the possible sources of help you might consider, 
from your friendly neighbourhood bank to a discount broker. Packed with 
inside information about who does what, this part will help you figure out 
exactly what you’re looking for in terms of financial advice, and how much 
that advice should set you back.

 Introduction
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building 
a Strong Portfolio
Herein lies the industry’s entire menu of funds, give or take a handful. These 
days funds exist for every type of investor, from the daredevil who would just 
as soon go to the racetrack to the notorious mattress stuffer who can’t part 
with a single dime. This part runs through the many fund types and helps you 
match your financial goals to what these beasts have to offer. All the biggies 
are here — equity funds, money market funds, and index funds, plus a look 
at fund packages. Each chapter includes suggestions for winning funds, pre-
pared for this book by analysts at Morningstar, the country’s leading mutual 
fund research firm.
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of 
Keeping Your Portfolio Going
Getting started in funds may seem like the hard part, but keeping your port-
folio humming along and turning a profit is a challenge all its own. In this part 
we offer some valuable advice on tracking your progress and optimizing the 
mighty combination of your registered retirement savings plan and mutual 
funds. We also take a long hard look at taxes and your funds.
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a collection of quick factoids about funds. We list ten 
common investing foul-ups in funds, which we hope you’ll find entertaining 
as well as disturbing. We also list ten things to consider when hiring a sales-
person — and a to-do list to consult if you’re wondering whether to dump one.
Icons Used in This Book
Ever go over one of those speed bumps — the British call them “sleeping 
policemen” — at full throttle? Catches your attention. This finance stuff can 
get heavy after the 200th page. So, to keep you alert, throughout the book we 
sprinkle icons in the margin to wake you up and highlight important informa-
tion that’s too good to miss. It might be a grim admonition, a neat piece of 
advice, or a nugget of wisdom. Here’s what to look out for.

6
Mutual Fund Investing For Canadians For Dummies 
 
This icon — judiciously used — denotes a product or particular fund that 
does a good job and offers you benefits. But watch out — funds have an 
annoying habit of dropping to the bottom of the performance table right after 
writers recommend them. In part that’s because the type of investments the 
fund buys have already shot up in value.
 
Remember icons flag an important piece of information that’s like the cru-
cial clue in an Agatha Christie novel. The bit where the jealous sister-in-law 
couldn’t possibly have heard the 1 a.m. time check on the radio when she said 
she did — because the clocks went forward that night. Our turning points won’t 
be so complicated. They’re simply realities about mutual funds that are worth 
always bearing in mind.
 
Relax: You can get away without reading this stuff. But for those who like a 
good conspiracy story, this icon denotes interesting, if not throwaway, infor-
mation. It flags a place where we talk about the internal workings of a fund. 
But you can invest in funds perfectly well without reading it. In practice, 
Technical Stuff usually involves the money that fund managers and sales-
people get from the funds they market. That’s the thing that kind of drives the 
whole show forward.
 
The Tip icons point to methods or suggestions that save you money, improve 
your returns, or reduce your risk. They’re also quick-and-dirty shortcuts. Or 
they mark practicalities that fund companies may not mention.
 
Warning icons flag a dangerous reef that you have to skirt — something that 
could cost you lots of money, either by hitting you with excessive manage-
ment and sales fees, by leaving you vulnerable to nasty losses, or by dragging 
down your overall returns.

ere’s all you need to build a perfectly good mutual

least some funds. We also describe how funds work and 
set out the basic mechanics of buying funds and using

fully into just about everyone’s financial plan, and show 
you some of the alternative investments you can buy.

U
nless you’ve been living in a cave high in the mountains for the past 
decade, railing against the evils of humankind, you’ve heard a lot 
about mutual funds. Chances are you or someone in your family already 
owns some. Mutual funds seem complicated — even though they are incred-
ibly popular — so lots of people shy away. Many people aren’t sure where 
to start, or they just buy the first fund their banker or financial planner sug-
gests. All too often Canadians end up disappointed with their funds’ perfor-
mance, because they’ve been sold something that’s either unsuitable or just 
too expensive. It’s a shame, because building a portfolio of excellent funds is 
easy if you follow a few simple rules and use your own common sense. This 
stuff isn’t complicated — a mutual fund is just a money-management service 
that operates under clear rules. Yes, it involves a lot of marketing mumbo-
jumbo and arcane terminology, but the basic idea could be written on a post-
age stamp: In return for a fee, the people running the fund promise to invest 
your money wisely and give it back to you on demand.
The fund industry is competitive and sophisticated, which means plenty of 
good choices are out there. In this chapter, we show how funds make you 
money — especially if you leave your investment in place for several years. 
We also touch on the different types available, and quickly describe the main 
places you can go to buy funds. We discuss these topics in greater detail 
later in the book, but after you read this first chapter you’ll know the basics.

Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
Mutual Fund Basics
 
A mutual fund is a pool of money that a company gets from investors like you 
and me and divides up into equally priced units. Each unit is a tiny slice of 
the fund. When you put money into the fund or take it out again, you either 
buy or sell units. For example, say a fund has total assets — that is, money 
held in trust for investors — of $10 million and investors have been sold a 
total of 1 million units. Then each unit is worth $10. If you put money into the 
fund, you’re simply sold units at that day’s value. If you take money out, the 
fund buys units back from you at the same price. (Handling purchase and 
sale transactions in units makes it far simpler to do the paperwork.) And the 
system has another huge advantage: As long as you know how many units you 
own, you can simply check their current price to find out how much your total 
investment is worth. For example, if you hold 475 units of a fund whose cur-
rent unit price is $15.20, then you know your holding has a value of 475 times 
$15.20, or $7,220.
 
Owning units of a mutual fund makes you — you guessed it — a unitholder. In 
fact, you and the other unitholders are the legal owners of the fund. But the 
fund is run by a company that’s legally known as the fund manager — the firm 
that handles the investing and also deals with the fund’s administration. The 
terminology gets confusing here because the person (usually an employee of 
the fund manager) who chooses which stocks, bonds, or other investments 
the fund should buy is also usually called the fund manager. To make things 
clear, we refer to the company that sells and administers the fund as the 
management company or fund sponsor. We use the term fund manager for 
the person who picks the stocks and bonds. His or her skill is one of the main 
benefits you get from a mutual fund. Obviously, the fund manager should be 
experienced and not too reckless — after all, you’re trusting him or her with 
your money.
Under professional management, the fund invests in stocks and bonds, 
increasing the pool of money for the investors and boosting the value of the 
individual units. For example, if you bought units at $10 each and the fund 
manager managed to pick investments that doubled in value, your units 
would grow to $20. In return, the management company slices off fees and 
expenses. (In the world of mutual funds, just like almost everywhere else, you 
don’t get something for nothing.) Fees and expenses usually come to between 
0.3 percent and 3 percent of the fund’s assets each year, depending on how a 
fund invests. Some specialized funds charge much more.
Confused? Don’t be, it isn’t rocket science. This example should help. Units 
in Canada’s biggest mutual fund, Investors Dividend Fund — run by the coun-
try’s largest fund company, Investors Group — were bought from and sold 
to people like you and me at $21.83 each at the end of March 2008. So if you 

11
 Chapter 1: What Is a Mutual Fund?
invested $1,000 in the fund that day, you owned 45.8 units ($1,000 divided 
by $21.83). The price you pay for each unit is known as the fund’s net asset 
value per unit. The net asset value is the fund’s assets minus its liabilities, 
hence the “net” (which means after costs and debts are taken away), divided 
by the number of units outstanding.
So a fund company buys and sells the units to the public at their net asset 
value. This value increases or decreases proportionally as the value of the 
fund’s investments rises or falls. Let’s say in March you pay $10 each for 100 
units in a fund that invests in oil and gas shares, always a smelly and risky 
game. Now, say, by July, the value of the shares the fund holds has dropped 
by one-fifth. Then your units are worth just $8 each. So your original $1,000 
investment is now worth only $800. But that August, a bunch of companies in 
which the fund has invested strike oil in Alberta. That sends the value of their 
shares soaring and lifts the fund’s units to $15 each. The value of your invest-
ment has now grown to $1,500.
Where can you go from here? You’ve made a tidy profit after a bit of a let-
down, but what happens next? Well, that depends on you. You can hang in 
there and see if more oil’s in them there hills, or you can cash out. With most 
funds, you can simply buy or sell units at that day’s net asset value. That flex-
ibility is one of the great beauties of mutual funds. Funds that let you come 
and go as you please in this way are known as open-end funds, as though 
they had a giant door that’s never locked. Think of a raucous Viking banquet 
where guests are free to come and go at will because the wall at one end of 
the dining hall has been removed.
That means most mutual funds are marvelously flexible and convenient. 
The managers allow you to put money into the fund on any business day by 
buying units, and you take money out again at will by selling your units back 
to the fund. In other words, an investment in a mutual fund is a liquid asset. 
A liquid asset is either cash or it’s an investment that can be sold and turned 
into good old cash at a moment’s notice. The idea is that cash and close-
to-cash investments, just like water, are adaptable and useful in all sorts of 
situations. The ability to get your cash back at any time is called liquidity in 
investment jargon, and professionals prize it above all else — more than they 
prize red Porsches with very loud sound systems or crystal goblets in lovely 
velvet-lined boxes with their initials engraved in gold.
 
The other type of fund is a closed-end fund. Investors in these funds often are 
sold their units when the fund is launched, but to get their money back they 
must find another investor to buy the units on the stock market like a share, 
often at a loss. The fund usually won’t buy the units back, or may buy only 
a portion. You can make money in closed-end funds, but it’s very tricky. As 
craven brokerage analysts sometimes say when they hate a stock but can’t 
pluck up the courage to tell investors to sell it: “Avoid.”

Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
The Nitty Gritty: How a Fund 
Makes You Money
We’ll stick with the example of Investors Dividend, a huge and well-run fund 
generally available only through Investors Group agents across the country. 
Investors Dividend’s $12.3 billion in assets as of mid-2008 made it Canada’s 
biggest mutual fund. That’s $1 million 12,400 times over, or about $373 for 
each of the approximately 30 million people living in Canada. The fund, which 
dates to 1961, invests in shares of large Canadian banks and blue-chip compa-
nies. This behemoth lumbers along in the middle of the performance pack of 
similar funds. Like other mutual fund companies, Investors Group, based in 
Winnipeg, sells units of Investors Dividend to the public every business day 
and buys them back from other investors at the same price.
The somewhat sleazy dawn of the mutual fund
The modern mutual fund evolved in the 1920s in 
the United States. In 1924, one Edward Leffler 
started the world’s first open-end fund, the 
Massachusetts Investors Trust. It’s still going. 
Mr. Leffler’s fund had to be purchased through 
a broker, who charged a sales commission, 
adding to an investor’s cost. Four years later, 
Boston investment manager Scudder Stevens 
& Clark started First Investment Counsel Corp., 
the first no-load fund (a fund you buy with no 
sales commission). The fund was called no-
load because instead of purchasing it through a 
commission-charging broker, investors bought 
it directly from the company.
Nothing was wrong with those early open-end 
funds. They were run well and they survived 
the Great Crash of 1929 and the subsequent 
Depression, in part because the obligation to 
buy and sell their shares every day at an accu-
rate value tended to keep managers honest 
and competent. But closed-end funds were 
the main game in the 1920s. (Closed-end funds 
don’t buy back your units on demand, mean-
ing you’re locked into the fund until you find 
another investor to buy your units from you on 
the open market.) And a crooked game it was. 
By 1929, investors were paying ridiculous prices 
for closed-end shares. Brokers charged pirati-
cal sales commissions of 10 percent, annual 
expenses topped 12.5 percent, and funds kept 
their holdings secret. Needless to say, most col-
lapsed in the Crash and ensuing Depression.
Following that debacle, mutual funds in Canada 
and the United States were far more tightly 
regulated, with laws forcing them to disclose 
their holdings at least twice a year and report 
costs and fees to investors. Plenty of badly run 
funds are still out there, not to mention plenty of 
greedy managers who don’t put their unithold-
ers’ interests first, but at least now clear rules 
that protect investors who keep their eyes open 
exist.

 Chapter 1: What Is a Mutual Fund?
 
With most companies’ funds you’re free to come and go as you please, but 
companies often impose a small levy on investors who sell their units within 
90 days of buying them. That’s because constant trading raises expenses for 
the other unitholders and makes the fund manager’s job harder. The charge 
(which should go to the fund, and usually does) is generally 2 percent of the 
units sold, but it can be more. Check this out before you invest, especially if 
you’re thinking of moving your cash around shortly after you buy.
Returns — What’s in it for you?
The main reason why people buy mutual funds is to earn a return. A return 
is simply the profit you get in exchange for either investing in a business (by 
buying its shares) or for lending money to a government or company (by 
buying its bonds). It’s money you get as a reward for letting other people use 
your cash — and for putting your money at risk. Mutual fund buyers earn the 
same sorts of profits but they make them indirectly because they’re using a 
fund manager to pick their investments for them. The fund itself earns the 
profits, which are either paid out to the unitholders or retained within the 
fund itself, increasing the value of each of its units.
When you invest money, you nearly always hope to get:
 
 Trading profits or capital gains (the two mean nearly the same thing) 
when the value of your holdings goes up. Capital is just the money 
you’ve tied up in an investment, and a capital gain is simply an increase 
in its value. For example, say you buy gold bars at $100 each and their 
price rises to $150. You’ve earned a capital gain of $50, on paper at least.
 
 Income in the form of interest on a bond or loan, or dividends from a 
company. Interest is the regular fee you get in return for lending your 
money, and dividends are a portion of a company’s profits paid out to 
its shareowners. For example, say you deposit $1,000 at a bank at an 
annual interest rate of 5 percent; each year you’ll get interest of $50 (or 
5 percent of the money you deposited). Dividends are usually paid out 
by companies on a per-share basis. Say, for example, you own 10,000 
shares and the company’s directors decide to pay a dividend of 50 cents 
per share. You’ll get a cheque for $5,000.
You also hope to get the money you originally invest back at the end of the 
day, which doesn’t always happen. That’s part of the risk you assume with 
almost any investment. Companies can lose money, sending the value of their 
shares tumbling. Or inflation can rise, which nearly always makes the value 
of both shares and bonds drop rapidly. That’s because inflation eats away at 
the value of the money, which makes it less attractive to have the money tied 
up in such long-term investments where it’s vulnerable to steady erosion.

14
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
Here’s an example to illustrate the difference between earning capital gains 
and dividend income. Say you buy 100 shares of a company — a Costa Rican 
crocodile farm, for example — for $115 each and hold them for an entire 
year. Also, say you get $50 in dividend income during the year because the 
company has a policy of paying four quarterly dividends of 12.5 cents, or 50 
cents per share, annually (that is, 50 cents times the 100 shares you own — 
$50 right into your pocket).
Now imagine the price of the stock rises in the open market by $12, from $115 
to $127. The value of your 100 shares rises from $11,500 to $12,700, for a total 
capital gain of $1,200.
 
Your capital gain is only on paper unless you actually sell your holdings at 
that price.
Add up your gains and income, and that’s your total return — $50 in divi-
dends plus a capital gain of $1,200, for a total of $1,250.
Another example should make this crystal clear. Investors Dividend units were 
sold to the public at $24.77 on the first day of April 2007 and rose to $25.48 by 
the end of May. Things weren’t so good the rest of the year: The unit price went 
up and down until October, when it began a prolonged fall, to $21.83 by the end 
of March 2008. That was a loss of 2.9 cents on every unit an investor held.
The fund also paid out a quarterly distribution, a special or scheduled payment 
to unitholders, of 14.5 cents per unit at the end of June and September 2007; 
15.2 cents at the end of December 2007; and 16.0 cents at the end of March 
2008, for a total distribution of 58.7 cents. Distributions are made when a fund 
has earned capital gains, interest, or dividends from its investments.
So what was the investor’s return during the year? On a per-unit basis, she 
started with $24.77 at risk and during the following 12 months suffered a 
capital loss of $2.94. However, thanks to the 58.7 cents of distributions, this 
loss was trimmed to about $2.44 a unit. That represented about 9.8 percent of 
the starting figure of $24.77, so the percentage return, the amount she earned 
or lost by being invested, was a loss of 9.8 percent. Calculating the return is 
actually a little more complicated than that because most investors would 
have simply reinvested the quarterly distribution in more units immediately 
after being paid out. In fact, returns for mutual funds always assume that all 
distributions are reinvested in more units. Investors Dividend’s official return 
for the year ended March 31, 2008, was a loss of 9.5 percent.
Returns as a percentage
 
Returns on mutual funds, and nearly all other investments, are usually 
expressed as a percentage of the capital the investor originally put up. That 
way you can easily compare returns and work out whether or not you did well.

15
 Chapter 1: What Is a Mutual Fund?
After all, if you tied up $10 million in an investment to earn only $1,000, you 
wouldn’t be using your cash very smartly. That’s why the return on any invest-
ment is nearly always stated in percentages by expressing the return as a 
proportion of the original investment. In the example of the crocodile farm, the 
return was $50 in dividends plus $1,200 in capital appreciation, which is just a 
fancy term for an increase in the value of your capital, for a total of $1,250. At 
the beginning of the year you put $11,500 into the shares by buying 100 of them 
at $115 each. To get your percentage return (the amount your money grew 
expressed as a percentage of your initial investment), divide your total return 
by the amount you initially invested and then multiply the answer by 100. The 
return of $1,250 represented 10.9 percent of $11,500, so your percentage return 
during the year was 10.9 percent. It’s the return produced by an investment 
over several years, however, that people are usually interested in. Yes, it’s 
often useful to look at the return in each individual year — for example, a loss 
of 10 percent in Year 1, a gain of 15 percent in Year 2, and so on. But that’s a 
long-winded way of expressing things. It’s handy to be able to state the return 
in just one number that represents the average yearly return over a set period. 
It makes it much easier, for instance, to compare the performance of two dif-
ferent funds. The math can start getting complex here, but don’t worry — we 
stick to the basic method used by the fund industry.
Fund returns are expressed, in percentages, as an average annual compound 
return. That sounds like a mouthful, but the concept is simple. Say you invested 
$1,000 in a fund for three years. In the first year, the value of your investment 
dropped by 10 percent, or one-tenth, leaving you with $900. In Year 2, the fund 
earned you a return of 20 percent, leaving you with $1,080. And in Year 3, the 
fund produced a return of 10 percent, leaving you with $1,188. So, over the three 
years, you earned a total of $188, or 18.8 percent of your initial $1,000 invest-
ment. When mutual fund companies convert that return to an “average annual” 
number, they invariably express the number as a “compound” figure. That 
simply means the return in Year 2 is added (or compounded) onto the return in 
Year 1, and the return in Year 3 is then compounded onto the new higher total, 
and so on. A return of 18.8 percent over three years works out to an average 
annual compound return of about 5.9 percent.
As the example demonstrates, the actual value of the investment fluctuated over 
the three years, but say it actually grew steadily at 5.9 percent. After one year, 
the $1,000 would be worth $1,059. After two years, it would be worth $1,121.48. 
And after three years, it would be worth $1,187.65. The total differs from $1,188 
by a few cents because we rounded off the average annual return to one decimal 
place, instead of fiddling around with hundredths of a percentage point.
 
Remember these important points when looking at an average annual com-
pound return:
 
 Average: That innocuous-looking average usually smoothes out some 
mighty rough periods. Mutual funds can easily lose money for years on 
end — it happened, for example, when the world economy was hurt by 
inflation and recession in the 1970s.

16
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
 
 Annual: Obviously, this means per year. And mutual funds should be 
thought of as long-term holdings to be owned for several years. The gen-
eral rule in the industry is that you shouldn’t buy an equity fund — one 
that invests in shares — unless you plan to own it for five years. That’s 
because stocks can drop sharply, often for a year or more, and you’d 
be silly to risk money you might need in the short term (to buy a house, 
say) in an investment that might be down from its purchase value when 
you go to cash it in. With money you’ll need in the near future, you’re 
better off to stick to a super-stable, short-term bond or money market 
fund that will lose little or no money (more about those later).
 
 Of course, mutual fund companies sometimes use the old “long-term 
investing” mantra as an excuse. If their funds are down, they claim it’s a 
long-term game and that investors should give their miraculous strategy 
time to work. But if the funds are up, the managers run ads screaming 
about the short-term returns.
 
 Compound: This little word, which means “added” or “combined” in this 
context, is the plutonium trigger at the heart of investing. It’s the device 
that makes the whole thing go. It simply means that to really build your 
nest egg, you have to leave your profits or interest in place and work-
ing for you so you can start earning income on income. After a while, of 
course, you start earning income on the income you’ve earned, until it 
becomes a very nicely furnished hall of mirrors.
 
 Another example will help. Mr. Simple and Ms. Compound each have 
$1,000 to invest, and the bank’s offering 10 percent a year. Now, let’s 
say Mr. Simple puts his money into the bank, but each year he takes the 
interest earned and hides it under his mattress. Simple-minded, huh? 
After ten years, he’ll have his original $1,000 plus the ten annual interest 
payments of $100 each under his futon, for a total of $2,000. But canny 
Ms. Compound leaves her money in the account, so each year the inter-
est is added to the pile and the next year’s interest is calculated on the 
higher amount. In other words, at the end of the first year, the bank adds 
her $100 in interest to her $1,000 initial deposit and then calculates the 
10-percent interest for the following year on the higher base of $1,100, 
which earns her $110. Depending on how the interest is calculated and 
timed, she’ll end the ten years with about $2,594, or $594 more than Mr. 
Simple. That extra $594 is interest earned on interest.
How funds can make you rich
 
The real beauty of mutual funds is the way they can grow your money over 
many years. “Letting your money ride” in a casino — by just leaving it on the 
odd numbers in roulette, for example — is a dumb strategy. The house will 
eventually win it from you because the odds are stacked in the casino opera-
tor’s favour. But letting your money ride in a mutual fund over a decade or 
more can make you seriously rich.

17
 Chapter 1: What Is a Mutual Fund?
An investment in Investors Dividend Fund from its launch in 1961 through 
the end of June 2008 produced an annual average compound return of about 
8 percent. If your granny had been prescient enough to put $10,000 into the 
fund when it was launched, instead of blowing all her dough on sports cars 
and wild men, it would have been worth $5.4 million by mid-2008.
The main reason why Canadians had more than $697 billion in mutual funds 
at the end of 2007 is that funds let you make money in the stock and bond 
markets almost effortlessly. By the way, that $697 billion figure, which works 
out to an incredible $21,121 or so for everyone in the country, doesn’t even 
include billions more sitting in segregated funds, which are mutual fund–
like products sold by life insurance companies. They’re called segregated 
because they’re kept separate from the life insurer’s regular assets. You can 
read more on seg funds in Chapter 19.
Of course, no law says you have to buy mutual funds in order to invest. 
You might make more money investing on your own behalf, and lots of 
people from all walks of life do. But it’s tricky and dangerous. So millions 
of Canadians too busy or scared to learn the ropes themselves have found 
that funds are a wonderfully handy and reasonably cheap alternative. 
The Canadian fund industry association, the Investment Funds Institute 
of Canada, reports the public had more than 52 million accounts with its 
member firms at the end of 2007. Buying funds is like going out to a restau-
rant compared with buying food, cooking a meal, and cleaning up afterward. 
Yes, eating out is expensive, but it sure is nice not to have to face those cold 
pots in the sink covered in slowly congealing mustard sauce.
What mutual funds buy
Mutual funds and other investors put their money into just two long-term 
investments:
 
 Stocks and shares: Tiny slices of companies that trade in a big, some-
times chaotic but reasonably well-run electronic vortex called, yes, the 
stock market.
 
 Bonds: Loans made to governments or companies, which are packaged 
up so that investors can trade them to one another.
Folk memories run deep, and after ugly stock market meltdowns in the 1920s 
and 1970s, mutual funds and stocks in general had unhealthy reputations 
for many years. For generations, Canadians, like people all over the world, 
preferred to buy sure things, usually bonds or fixed-term deposits from 
banks, the beloved guaranteed investment certificate (GIC). But as inflation 
and interest rates started to come down in the 1990s, it became harder and 
harder to find a GIC that paid a decent rate of interest — research shows 
most people are truly happy when they get 8 percent.

18
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
As Table 1-1 shows, the Canadian mutual fund industry really started grow-
ing like a magic mushroom on a wet morning in Victoria in the mid-1990s, 
after rates on five-year GICs dropped well below that magic 8 percent. At that 
point, Canadians decided they were willing to take a risk on equity funds.
Table 1-1 shows the growth of the Canadian mutual fund industry from 1970 
to the end of March 2008.

 Chapter 1: What Is a Mutual Fund?
Types of Funds
Mutual funds fall into four main categories. Later in the book we devote chap-
ters to each type, but this is a quick breakdown of the bare facts. The four 
main types of mutual funds are:
 
 Equity funds: By far the most popular type of fund on the market, equity 
funds hold stocks and shares. Stocks are often called “equity” because 
every share is supposed to entitle its owner to an equal portion of the 
company. In mid-2008, Canadians had $178 billion in Canadian stock 
funds, $93 billion in global stock funds, and another $20 billion in U.S. 
equity funds. These funds represent an investment in raw capitalism — 
ownership of businesses. We look at the range of equity funds available 
to you in Chapters 10, 11, and 12.
 
 Balanced funds: The next biggest category is balanced funds. They 
generally hold a mixture of just about everything — from Canadian and 
foreign stocks to bonds from all around the world, as well as very short-
term bonds that are almost as safe as cash. Chapter 13 gives you the 
scoop on balanced funds.
 
 Bond funds: These beauties, also referred to as “fixed-income” funds, 
essentially lend money to governments and big companies, collecting 
regular interest each year and (nearly always) getting the cash back in 
the end. We offer the thrilling details about these funds in Chapter 14.
 
 Money market funds: They hold the least volatile and most stable of all 
investments — very short-term bonds issued by governments and large 
companies that usually provide the lowest returns. These funds are basi-
cally savings vehicles for money you can’t afford to take any risks with. 
They can also act as the safe little cushion of cash found in nearly all 
well-run portfolios. Chapter 17 fills you in about these funds.
Where-to-Buy Basics
Chapter 3 goes into detail about some of the legal and bureaucratic form-filling 
involved in buying a fund (don’t worry, it’s not complicated). In essence, you 
hand over your money and a few days later you get a transaction slip or con-
firmation slip stating the number of units you bought and what price you paid. 
You can buy a mutual fund from thousands of people and places across Canada, 
in one of four basic ways:
 
 Buying from professional advisers: The most common method of making 
a fund purchase in Canada is to go to a stockbroker, financial planner, or 
other type of adviser who offers watery coffee, wisdom, and suggestions 
on what you should buy. These people will also open an account for you 
in which to hold your mutual funds. They are essentially salespeople and 

20
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
they nearly always make their living by collecting sales commissions on 
the funds they sell you, usually from the fund company itself. Their advice 
may be excellent and they can justifiably claim to impose needed disci-
pline on their clients by getting them into the healthy habit of saving. But 
always remember that they have to earn a living: The funds they offer will 
tend to be the ones that pay them the best commissions.
 
 Examples of fund companies that sell exclusively through salespeople, 
planners, and stockbrokers are Mackenzie Financial Corp., Fidelity 
Investments Canada Ltd., AIM Trimark Funds, CI Fund Management Inc., 
AGF Management Ltd., and Templeton, all based in Toronto. Investors 
Group Inc. of Winnipeg, Canada’s biggest fund company, also sells 
through salespeople, but the sales force is affiliated with the company.
 
 Bank purchases: The simplest way to buy funds is to walk into a bank 
branch. You also can call your bank’s toll-free telephone number. But, 
increasingly, people are buying funds online, at banks’ Web sites. Banks 
never charge sales commissions to investors who buy their funds. The 
disadvantage to this approach is limited selection, because most bank 
branches are set up to sell only their company’s funds. And not all bank 
staff are equipped or trained to give you detailed advice about investing. 
But the beauty of this approach is that you can have all your money — 
including your savings and chequing accounts and even your mortgage 
or car loan — in one place, making it simple to transfer money from one 
account to another. Buying your mutual funds at your bank can also 
earn you special rates on loans.
 
 Buying direct from fund companies: For those who like to do more 
research on their own, excellent “no-load” companies sell their funds 
directly to investors. They’re called no-load funds because they’re 
sold with no sales commissions. No-load funds can avoid levying sales 
charges because they don’t market their wares through salespeople. 
Because these funds don’t have to make payments to the advisers 
who sell them, they often come with lower expenses. Examples of no-
load companies include Beutel Goodman; GBC; Leith Wheeler; Mawer; 
McLean Budden; Phillips, Hager & North; Sceptre; and Saxon. Once 
again, limited selection of funds is a drawback.
 
 Buying from discount brokers: Finally, for the real do-it-yourselfers 
who like to make just about every decision independently, you can find 
discount brokers that operate on the Internet or over the phone. Mostly 
but not always owned by the big banks, they sell nearly every fund from 
nearly every company, usually free of commissions and sales pitches.
 
 Discount brokers are a huge force in the United States and they’ve 
gained popularity in Canada. The advantages, and they’re significant, are 
low costs and a wide selection of funds. But don’t expect personal help 
from a discounter. We talk more about discount brokers in Chapter 6.

 Exploring reasons to choose mutual funds
 Looking at potential drawbacks of funds
 Considering load versus no-load funds
M
utual funds were one of the 20th century’s great wealth-creating 
innovations. Funds transformed stock and bond markets by giving 
people of modest means easy access to investments previously limited to the 
rich. The fund-investing concept is likely to remain popular for years, letting 
ordinary and not-so-ordinary people build their money in markets that would 
otherwise intimidate them. That’s because the idea of packaging expert 
money management in a consumer product, which is then bought and sold in 
the form of units, is so brilliantly simple. Even journalists can understand it.
In this chapter, we take another look at funds, assessing their great potential 
as well as their nasty faults. We wrap up with a chat about the relative merits 
of no-load and load funds.
Reasons to Buy Funds
In Chapter 1, we discuss how and why mutual funds work and why they make 
sense in general. Here we give you some specific, significant reasons to make 
them a big part of your financial plan.
Offering safety in numbers: Public 
scrutiny and accountability
Perhaps the best thing about mutual funds is that their performance is public 
knowledge. When you own a fund, you’re in the same boat as thousands of 
other unitholders, meaning the fund company is pressured to keep up the 
performance. If the fund lags its rivals for too long, unitholders will start 

22
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
redeeming, or cashing in, their units, which is the sort of thing that makes a man-
ager stare at the ceiling at 4 a.m., sweat rolling down his or her grey face. Fund 
companies are obliged to let the sun shine into their operations — and sunlight 
is the best disinfectant — by sending unitholders clear annual financial state-
ments of the fund’s operations. These statements are tables of figures showing 
what the fund owns at the end of the year, what expenses and fees it paid to the 
management company, and how well it performed. Statements are audited (that 
is, checked) by big accounting firms. The management company must also at 
least offer to send you the semi-annual statements, showing how the fund was 
doing halfway through the year. (To get the semi-annual statement, you often 
have to mail back a fiddly little card requesting it. Make sure you do. It costs you 
nothing, and knowing that investors are interested in what’s happening to their 
money helps to keep fund companies on their toes. If you want to reduce paper 
burden, make a note of looking for this information on the fund company’s Web 
site.) For more on the financial statements for funds, see Chapter 3.
A lot of the information in the statements is hard to understand and not particu-
larly useful, but always check one thing: Look at the fund’s main holdings. If you 
bought what you thought was a conservative Canadian stock, for example, then 
you want to see lots of bank stocks and other companies you’ve at least heard of.
 
Don’t confuse the financial statements — which describe how the fund is doing — 
with your own individual account statement. Your account statements are per-
sonal mailings that show how many units you own, how many you’ve bought and 
sold, and how much your holdings are worth. Companies usually must send you 
personal account statements at least twice a year. Some fund sellers, such as 
banks, send quarterly statements, and discount brokers often mail them monthly. 
Fund companies also have Internet-based and telephone-based services that let 
you verify the amount of money in your account every day. See Chapter 3 for 
more on account statements.
The next section helps you decipher price and performance figures. When you 
know what to look for, you can accurately track your funds’ performance. We’re not 
saying your fund manager won’t give you the straight story, but getting a second 
opinion is never a bad plan, especially when it comes to your cash.
Finding and reading price tables
Time was you could check a mutual fund’s unit price, or net asset value per share, 
in most daily newspapers. (A fund’s NAVPS is its total assets under management 
divided by the numbers or shares of units held by its investors; less the manage-
ment fees and other operating expenses charged to the fund by its portfolio man-
agers or administators.) But daily tables are now virtually extinct, and the few that 
remain are on the endangered species list. Although the two national dailies, The 
Globe and Mail and the National Post, still publish weekly price summary tables, 
these include only a handful of the larger, more popular funds. Only the Post con-
tinues to offer a (very short) daily table. It takes a lot of news-page space to print 
more than 7,000 fund prices, so the newspaper industry now uses the Internet to 

23
 Chapter 2: Buying and Selling Basics
provide this information. If you’re Internet-savvy, you also can look up fund prices 
on individual fund company Web sites. We talk more about how to look up fund 
prices and check performance in Chapter 21.
Most mutual funds calculate and publish a value for their units every day that 
stock and bond markets are open. Some small or very specialized funds do 
this only monthly or weekly, and some take a day or two getting the informa-
tion out, but unit prices for most widely available funds are available the next 
day on fund information Web sites and, to a limited extent, in major newspa-
pers. The listing also usually shows the change in unit price from the previ-
ous day. See Figure 2-1 for a Saturday listing for Investors Dividend Fund from 
the Financial Post.

Checking and reading mutual fund performance
Newspapers’ monthly fund performance reports have gone the way of the 
dodo bird. This is unfortunate if you liked to opened up those broad pages full 
of wide tables and highlight and circle things. Checking fund performance is 
now strictly an Internet operation. Assuming you are comfortable online, this is 
a very good thing. Apart from saving countless trees that used to be chopped 
up into newsprint pulp, you can get more immediate information and easily 
compare a fund against its peers and other investments. Go to Chapter 21 for 
more on how to make the most of the Internet for fund research.
Because mutual fund investing is primarily a longer-term undertaking, perfor-
mance statistics should command more of your attention than daily prices do. 
How often should you check your fund’s performance? Unfortunately, this ques-
tion has no easy answer. But it’s a good idea to look every three months or so to 
see how your manager is doing. Even if you bought your funds through a finan-
cial planner or other salesperson — who’s supposed to be looking out for your 
interests — it never hurts to keep an eye on how well the recommendations are 
turning out.

Figure 2-2 is a sample from Morningstar.ca showing the returns for the 
Canadian Equity Balanced category, ranked by five-year compound annual 
return. Funds that buy the same sorts of investments are listed together, 
by category. Determining how a fund is categorized isn’t easy nowadays, 
because data providers, who are members of the Canadian Investment Funds 
Standards Committee, use more than 40 asset categories. Your first step, 
then, is to enter the name of a fund in a Web site’s general fund search tool, 
and then check its category on the page that appears.

are the percentage changes in price over one day, one week, one month, and 
three months, as well as the change from the beginning of the year. This is but 
one of many pages available on Morningstar.ca that provide data for this and 
all other fund categories. Similar information is available on Globefund.com. Go

 Chapter 2: Buying and Selling Basics
Making sense of the numbers
 
What can you do with this jumble of numbers? The unit price is useful informa-
tion, because by multiplying the price by the number of units you own you can 
work out the value of your holdings. You can also make sure the unit price in the 
newspaper matches the price shown on the statement you get from your broker 
or fund company, in order to double-check their bookkeeping. Keep the news-
paper’s mutual fund reports for June 30 and December 31 in your little sequined 
satchel until you’ve done your checking, because you’ll be getting reports from 
your fund company showing the value of your holdings as of those dates.
The unit price is also handy if you’re hazy on which fund you actually own. 
Don’t laugh — a lot of smart people aren’t always sure. With more than 7,000 
funds, versions of funds, and fund-like products available in Canada, it’s easy to 
get confused. Often, several different versions of a particular fund are on sale, 
depending on how you buy it (such as a front-end or back-end load) and other 
factors such as investment guarantees. If your account statement shows you 
own a fund with a unit price of $10.95, for instance, and the newspaper reports 
the same price, chances are you’re talking about the same fund. However, you 
might have to go so far as to check your statements for the precise name of the 
fund, including the series or class letter — or even check the fund sales code, 
which is used by fund salespeople when making transactions.
 
The meat of the subject is contained in the performance numbers. These 
returns are after the fund’s fees and expenses have been deducted. Some 
exceptions to this practice exist in the monthly report — that is, funds that 
levy extra charges that reduce the performance shown — but the returns for 
all of the biggest companies are after charges. The companies that deduct fees 
and expenses after the returns shown in such tables are generally fund com-
panies that sell funds as part of a comprehensive financial package. Clients get 
a customized statement that lists their fees separately, instead of lumping in 
the charges with the fund’s overall return. Always check whether the returns 
you’re being shown are before or after the deduction of all charges and costs.
Putting your eggs in many baskets
Another good reason to buy mutual funds is the fact that they instantly miti-
gate your risk by letting you own lots of stocks and bonds, ideally in many 
different markets. Diversification, spreading your dollars around, is the 
cornerstone of successful investing. Diversifying means you won’t be slaugh-
tered by a collapse in the price of one or two shares.
 
Some people learn about diversification the hard way. Investors think they’ve 
lucked into the next big thing, hand over their entire fortune, and then lose it 
all in a cruel market correction. Pinning your hopes on just one stock or hand-
ful of stocks is never a wise move, so don’t let this happen to you.

26
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
Mutual funds let ordinary investors buy into faraway markets and assets. It 
would be difficult and expensive for most ordinary people to purchase shares 
in Asia or Europe, or bonds issued by Latin American governments (go easy 
on those, though), if they couldn’t buy them through mutual funds. Although 
events of global impact such as terrorist activity, natural disasters, and the 
surging price of oil have an impact on markets worldwide, some respond 
positively to developments, and others respond negatively. It’s tough to keep 
track of it all and predict which markets will be affected and by how much. 
So, we ask: Why even try? History demonstrates that a portfolio with lots of 
different and varied asset classes will tend to suffer fewer speed bumps.
 
Most equity mutual funds own shares in at least 50 companies — fund manag-
ers who try to go with more “concentrated” portfolios have been known to 
get their fingers burned. In fact, academic research suggests that only seven 
stocks may be enough to provide adequate diversification for an investor, but 
seeing dozens of names in a portfolio offers a lot more reassurance.
Getting good returns from 
professional management
One of the most entertaining and informative books ever written on the subject 
of investing is A Fool and His Money: The Odyssey of an Average Investor by 
John Rothchild. First published in 1988, the book describes Mr. Rothchild’s own 
abject failure in the market and includes his observation that most amateur 
investors are less than frank about how they’ve actually done. Even if they’ve 
had their heads handed to them, they tend to claim they ended up “about even.” 
The moral of the story: Even if your relatives and pals claim to have made a for-
tune in the market, treat their boasts with a goodly dose of skepticism.
Yes, bad funds abound. But chances are you’ll do better in a mutual fund 
than you would investing on your own. At least the people running funds are 
professionals who readily dump a stock when it turns sour, instead of hang-
ing on like grim death, as we amateurs tend to do. The habit of selling quickly 
and taking the loss while it’s still small is said to be one of the main traits that 
distinguishes the pro from the amateur.
Making investing convenient
Funds are just so darned handy, no wonder hundreds of millions of people 
around the world buy them. Yes, you could make your own lip balm. You 
could gather the eucalyptus bark and the deer’s eyelid secretions, and boil 
them up in a big copper pot for days while chanting your head off. But it’s 
easier just to walk into the drugstore and buy a stick. Likewise, it’s a snap to 
sign a cheque or let the fund company deduct cash from your bank account 

27
 Chapter 2: Buying and Selling Basics
regularly — a lot easier than worrying about the market and finding out 
the difference between investing in a long-dated strip bond and an exciting, 
newly listed, Internet solutions startup with scalable technology.
Critics of funds claim, with some justification, that the industry has brain-
washed members of the public into thinking they’re too stupid to invest for 
themselves. And it does seem fund companies want us to believe it’s neces-
sary to have some 25-year-old pup in a suit do it for us, in return for a fat fee. 
But the reality is that most people are just too busy, confused, or plain lazy 
to figure out the investing game. This book will make you an educated fund 
investor, whether you choose to deal with that young pup or go it alone. In 
Chapter 4, we list a few sample portfolios that are about as easy to buy as a 
candy bar — and a lot better for you.
The difference between the average 
and the median
Sometimes figuring out whether a fund has done 
better than other funds in its group is harder 
than it looks. When you look at a newspaper 
fund report, you’ll come across two terms used 
to describe the typical fund’s performance: The 
average and the median. The average and the 
median are both numbers that attempt to show 
how funds in a particular category have done. 
That way, if you’re interested in a fund you can 
compare its performance with that of its rivals. 
For example, if you’re considering buying your 
bank’s U.S. equity fund, it’s a good idea to see 
how it has done compared with other funds in the 
U.S. equity category. However, sometimes the 
average can be distorted upward or downward 
by a few extreme cases, so the median acts as a 
middle point, giving a good idea of what the typi-
cal return for funds was. Here’s how it works:
  The average is calculated by simply adding 
up the return figures for all funds for a 
particular period and then dividing by the 
number of funds involved.
  The median is the halfway mark. Half of the 
funds were below that point and half were 
above.
Normally, the two numbers are very similar, but 
a sprinkling of very high or low returns in the 
sample can pull them apart. An “average” figure 
can be a misleading comparative, because it 
gives equal weight to each and every member 
of that group — regardless of the significance 
of each member. To be truly useful, an average 
must be “weighted” according to, in the case of 
a fund category, each individual fund’s assets.
For an example, take a look at the Canadian 
small/mid-cap equity category, which includes 
more volatile funds that focus on stocks of 
smaller companies. In 2006, the average fund 
in this category gained 14.0 percent, while the 
median return was just 10.9 percent. Why such 
a great difference? Because the average was 
pumped up by enormous returns — as high as 
60.5 percent — from a handful of funds that 
happened to ride some red-hot little shares. 
Although 2006 was a good year for this type of 
fund, about one-third of them made less than 
10 percent — nowhere near the stratospheric 
numbers put in by the category leaders.

28
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
Investing without breaking the bank
The typical Canadian stock fund rakes off about 2.3 percent of your money 
each year in fees and costs. That’s a hefty charge, but the fund company also 
relieves you of a lot of drudgery and tiresome paperwork in return. Funds 
offer a lot of convenience. The fund company keeps your money safe and 
handles the recordkeeping for your savings. It all leaves you free and clear to 
get on with your first love, naked samba dancing.
In fact, mutual funds are a positive bargain if you’re just starting to invest. 
Quite a few companies will let you put as little as $500 into their funds, and 
you can often open up a regular investment plan — where the money is 
simply taken out of your bank account — for as little as $50 a month. That’s a 
pretty good deal when you realize that fund companies actually lose money 
on small accounts. If an investor has, say, $1,000 in an equity fund with a 
management expense ratio (MER) of 2.3 percent, then the company is col-
lecting only $23 in fees and expenses, barely enough to cover postage and 
administration costs let alone turn a profit. Even the cheapest “discount” 
stockbroker in Canada will let you do only one trade for about 25 bucks.
The costs of a mutual fund investment are buried in the MER and the rela-
tively incomprehensible statement of operations, but at least you can work 
them out with a bit of digging. Try asking traditional full-service stockbrokers 
for a clear explanation of their commission rates. You’ll get a lot of mumbling 
and long sentences containing the phrase “it depends,” but no clear answers.
Why dollar-cost averaging may be a fairy tale
Pick up nearly any fund company’s colourful and 
relentlessly upbeat brochure (they’re written 
by chipmunks and tiny bluebirds that are cru-
elly force-fed a diet of snack cakes and fuchsia 
blossoms). Just before you pass out with bore-
dom, you’ll almost certainly see a phrase along 
these lines: “Investing small amounts regularly 
means you buy more units when prices are low 
and fewer units when they’re high, reducing the 
average cost of the units you purchase.” Well, 
maybe. But that’s about as useful as saying 
it’s a bad idea to go up to muscular guys in 
Sudbury, Ontario, and imitate them in a mock-
ing, mincing, way. Sort of obvious. The industry 
even has a name for the strategy — dollar-cost 
averaging.
Don’t get us wrong: Putting small amounts into 
a decently run mutual fund over many years is 
a great way to build wealth. But independent 
researchers are skeptical as to whether dollar-
cost averaging actually means better returns. If 
the strategy worked, you’d expect it to produce 
the best results with volatile funds — those 
whose unit prices bounce around the most — 
because you’d be buying lots when they were in 
the dumps and very few when they were riding 
high. Chicago-based researcher Ibbotson 
Associates, famed for compiling widely used 
figures on investment returns, looked at ten 
pairs of funds with the same compound annual 
returns over a decade but very different vola-
tility. Even using the fund industry’s beloved 

29
 Chapter 2: Buying and Selling Basics
Watching over your investment
Mutual fund companies are pretty closely watched, not only by overworked 
provincial securities regulators, but also, believe it or not, by rival compa-
nies. Competing companies don’t want a rotten peach spoiling the reputa-
tion of the whole barrel. The Investment Funds Institute of Canada (IFIC), 
the industry lobby group, is a mouthpiece for the companies, naturally. But 
it also generally keeps an eye on things. And Toronto, where most of the 
industry is based, is a village where everyone knows everyone. You’d be 
surprised how many industry executives tell reporters about skullduggery 
off the record — always about competing fund sellers, of course. Yes, greed 
abounds. Despite some improvements in recent years, fees are still too high, 
unitholder reports are often difficult to decipher, salespeople are given 
goodies, and funds are sometimes used as horns of plenty when managers 
divert their trading, and the resulting flow of commissions, to their broker-
age buddies. The good news is most companies are simply making too much 
money honestly to risk it all by running scams.
 
The stocks, bonds, and other securities a fund buys with your money don’t 
even stay in the coffers of the fund company: Under provincial securities laws, 
the actual assets of the fund must be held by a separate “custodian,” usually 
a big bank or similar institution. You’re most likely to get swindled by your 
salesperson, but in Chapter 8 we set out some of the best ways to protect 
yourself. Just stick with regular mutual funds, those that come with a docu-
ment called a “simplified prospectus” and are managed by widely known com-
panies, and you should be okay.
Cashing out — Getting your 
money if you need it
If you decide to move your hard-earned cash out of a fund, your fund com-
pany will normally get your money to you within three days. Removing 
money from a fund effortlessly whenever you like may not seem like a big 
deal — but in the world of investing, being able to do so whenever you 
want to, with no hassles or questions, is as good as a torrid fling with Ryan 
Reynolds or Shania Twain, your choice.
dollar-cost averaging strategy, the less vola-
tile fund produced the better return seven out 
of ten times. So invest small amounts regu-
larly, because it’s a great way to grow your 
money. But don’t assume you’re getting units at 
bargain basement prices. The evidence seems 
to be that the best way to make money in the 
stock and bond markets is simply to invest your 
cash as early as possible — and let time and 
compound returns work their magic.

30
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
 
Don’t forget that lots of other investments, including guaranteed investment 
certificates, hit you with a penalty if you take your cash out early. Selling a 
stock invariably costs you a brokerage commission with no guarantee you’ll 
get a decent price for your shares. Sell a bond and you’re often at the mercy of 
your dealer, who can pluck a price out of the air.
Perils and Pitfalls of Funds
So now that you’re convinced funds are the right place to be, we’re going to 
throw you for a bit of a loop. An informed investor is a wealthy investor, after 
all, and it’s important to realize that funds aren’t perfect. None of these dis-
advantages mean you shouldn’t buy mutual funds. But keeping them in mind 
will help you stay out of overpriced and unsuitable investments.
Excessive costs
When you start amassing serious money in mutual funds, your costs can get 
outrageous. For example, if you invest $100,000 in a set of typical equity funds 
with a management expense ratio of 2.3 percent, the fund company is siphon-
ing off $2,300 of your money every year. The math gets truly chilling when you 
extrapolate the cost of management fees over long periods. Over 20 years, at 
an MER of 2.3 percent, the fund company will end up with an incredible 50 per-
cent or so of the total accumulated capital. How so? Simply by slicing that little 
2.3 percent off the top each year.
In theory, that’s what it costs to pay a fund manager to actively invest on your 
behalf. But if you’re content to accept whatever return — good or bad — the 
overall market can achieve, then you can save a bundle by owning index funds 
or, better still, exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Index funds are funds with low 
expenses that simply track the whole stock or bond market by producing a 
return in line with a market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s/Toronto 
Stock Exchange composite index of approximately 300 well-known companies. 
An ETF is similar to an index fund except it trades on a stock exchange. They 
don’t have a portfolio manager as they simply own all of the stocks in an index. 
A typical index fund, such as RBC Canadian Index, has expenses of 0.71 per-
cent, and the main Canadian market ETF, iShares Canadian Composite Index, 
charges just 0.25 percent. See Chapter 15 for more on index funds and ETFs.

 Chapter 2: Buying and Selling Basics
Style drift — When managers 
get lost in the jungle
In the past, some managers would drift or depart from the type of invest-
ments they told you they’d buy when you signed on, usually because they 
were chasing hot returns or because they were scared. You can keep tabs on 
the biggest portfolio holdings in your fund by checking the fund company’s 
Web site — more on that in Chapter 21 — but your only legal entitlement to a 
full list of all of the portfolio contents is when the company sends you annual 
and semi-annual financial statements, but these typically do not arrive until 
three months following the period end.
The most prominent type of drift involves value and growth investing styles. 
The most glaring example of a value manager holding a growth stock was Nortel 
Networks in the late 1990s, which value managers held in their portfolios long 
after its price had multiplied many times. However, style drift has largely been 
a non-issue in recent years. One could argue that various Canadian equity funds 
run by AIM Trimark — a known value manager — are slipping into the growth 
stock arena by holding Research in Motion (RIM), the wireless device pioneer 
with a stock price many times greater than when Trimark Select Canadian Fund 
bought its shares in 2002. However, RIM was clearly a value play back then, 
so the issue becomes: How long should a value manager hold a stock that no 
longer provides value because its price is sky high?
 
Whether or not such examples represent style drift is highly debatable. It’s an 
example of how you as an investor need to monitor your fund investments. 
Ultimately, it’s your responsibility to make sure you’re headed in the right 
direction.
When bad managers attack
They may be smart and they may be professionals, but fund managers sure 
can blow it, leaving behind nothing but a lot of little scraps of grey polyester 
and a bunch of ugly minus signs in front of their returns. Put down whatever 
you’re eating — what you’re about to see would make a 400-pound wild boar 
queasy — and have a look at Table 2-1. It shows some of the worst-performing 
Canadian equity funds during the past decade, with assets over $50 million. 
If you hung around with any of these lads for the whole of the decade, you 
missed out on a lot of fun.

It’s very rarely as terrifying as that, though. Companies usually replace man-
agers of big funds after just a couple years of bad performance. Having a 
decent Canadian equity fund, in particular, is a marquee attraction for a com-
pany. It’s the fund category carrying the most prestige, partly because it wins 
the most attention from the media. You can be sure that just about every 
manager running a large equity or balanced fund, Canadian or global, is work-
ing his or her silk socks off trying to top the performance league. Every so 
often, companies get in bidding wars for managers with a great reputation. So 
everyone running a fund is trying to get public notice for earning hot returns, 
because it increases his or her market value.

Can’t see the forest for the funds
By mid-2008, Canada had an unbelievable 8,500 or so funds and fund-like prod-
ucts, counting segregated funds, U.S.–dollar editions, different versions with 
varying sales charges, and “guaranteed” funds with endlessly changing small 
print. There were funds that could be traded without racking up taxable capital 
gains, “market-neutral” funds that were supposed to shake off the effects of a 
bad stock market, funds that stuck to the safe and predictable world of income 
trusts, and funds that really didn’t seem to have any very good reason for exist-
ing, to be honest. Table 2-2 tells the tale of this proliferation, showing the total 
number of investment funds in Morningstar’s database at the end of each year 
since 1998.

This ridiculous profusion of products exists for several reasons:
 
 Fund companies have learned the folly of relying too much on just one 
or two funds. The danger, for them, is that if performance goes in the 
tank then investors head for the door, pulling out tens of millions of 
dollars. Better to offer many varied funds so that if one turns cold, the 
others are still cooking.

34
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
 
 Like being a superhero, the fund business is, well, glamorous, and every-
one wants in. But unlike pulling on the black tights, running a mutual 
fund is also profitable. When a fund company can get its assets above 
$100 million or so, it’s difficult to lose money because those 2-percent 
management fees keep rolling in. And all sorts of newcomers have been 
coming into the fund industry, including insurance companies and 
even financial planning chains. But they love to offer their own house-
brand funds because they get to keep all the fees instead of splitting 
the take with a separate name-brand fund company such as Mackenzie 
Financial Corp. or AGF Management Ltd. Clients are often happier with 
a name they’ve heard of, though, so insurance companies have taken to 
hiring well-known mutual fund companies as managers of their funds. 
However, the fund remains the insurance company’s own product — 
and the insurer gets to keep the lion’s share of the management fee.
 
 The investment game, with its hype and image obsession, is essentially 
a branch of showbiz. Every year you have something new to keep the 
salespeople awake and the investors hungry.
 
 Finally, in fairness to the industry, some of the new funds are meant 
to satisfy consumers’ demands. Investors’ thirst for income-producing 
investments in recent years brought a raft of funds that invest in income 
trusts and other income-generating securities. Although income trusts 
have lost their tax advantage over dividend-paying stocks, income-
producing investments remain a popular tool for many boomer-age and 
older investors.
Vague explanations of poor performance
No matter how badly a fund did, the analysis given to investors is frequently 
a languid description of the stock or bond market and a few of the manager’s 
choice reflections on the future of civilization. All written in a sort of Old 
Etonian detached and refined tone, as though the person running the fund 
was really just dabbling, old chap. Don’t really have to work at all, don’t you 
know, what with the estate in Scotland and the trust funds. Only really drop

What unitholders deserve, but too often are denied, is an honest discussion 
of whether their fund kept up with the market and its peers. Securities regula-
tors are putting the squeeze on companies to improve their reports, but it’ll 
take time. You shouldn’t have to pull on a grubby deerstalker hat and smoke a 
smelly pipe to discover what went wrong with performance and what the man-
ager plans to do about it.

35
 Chapter 2: Buying and Selling Basics
In the meantime, if your fund lags the market and other funds in the same cat-
egory, ask for a clear explanation from your broker or financial planner if you 
got advice when buying funds. If you bought a no-load fund, look for a written 
set of reasons in the company’s regular mailings to unitholders. Because no-
load companies deal directly with their investors — instead of going through 
a salesperson — their reports are often clearer than the information pro-
vided by companies that market their funds through advisers.
 
Another big problem in the reporting of performance is that all too often it’s 
not at all clear who is actually running your fund and how long they’ve been 
doing it. Fund companies rarely, if ever, print the length of a manager’s tenure, 
and they usually don’t warn investors in a timely way if he or she quits or is 
fired. Yes, a few veteran managers have been running the same fund for years. 
And some companies such as Fidelity Investments Canada Ltd. make it reason-
ably plain who’s actually calling the shots. But at many companies, managers 
come and go with such unpredictable frequency that it’s difficult if not impos-
sible to keep track of them. Rather than worry about finding a genius to pick 
your stocks, you’re much better off looking at the fund itself. Make your deci-
sion about investing with an eye to how the fund has performed and what it 
currently holds, rather than trying to figure out who is in the top spot.
Prospectuses that don’t say enough
It’s often hard to tell from a company’s Web site, promotional handouts, 
and even official reports to unitholders whether the returns from its funds 
have been any good. That’s because most companies, incredibly, still don’t 
show their performance against an appropriate market benchmark, such 
as the Standard & Poor’s/Toronto Stock Exchange composite index (S&P/
TSX) for Canadian equity funds or the MSCI World Index for global equity 
funds. However, things have gotten better since the fund industry began 
producing prospectuses that are fairly easy to understand. A prospectus is 
the document that must be given to the purchasers of a fund, describing its 
rules and risks. A prospectus must provide performance numbers that com-
pare a fund to a benchmark, such as the S&P/TSX for Canadian equity funds. 
Prospectuses also give the fund’s returns on a year-by-year calendar basis, 
which is invaluable for checking whether unitholders have enjoyed steady 
returns or suffered through insane swings.
However, prospectuses are still of only limited usefulness because they don’t 
say why the fund has lagged or outperformed its benchmark. Fortunately, a 
fairly new, additional document, the management report of fund performance, 
has taken a big step toward providing useful comparative data and explana-
tions of a fund’s recent performance. More on these in Chapter 3.

Too many funds and too 
few long-term results
Fund managers love to talk about how investing is a long-term game — 
especially when they’re losing money — but have you noticed how many ads 
you see touting performance over periods as short as one year? And com-
panies seem unable to resist launching new funds that invest in the hottest 
new asset class — just in time to lose money for investors when the bubble 
bursts. It happened with science and technology funds in the early 2000s. At 
the beginning of the decade, the number of funds in this category had multi-
plied to more than 120, but the group then tanked with huge losses in 2001 
and 2002. Today, fewer science and technology funds exist, but the group’s 
median compound annual returns are mostly negative over most time spans. 
Did Canadians really need such a selection of science and technology funds? 
As the performance numbers attest, they arguably didn’t need any of the 
wretched things. The median science and technology fund lost nearly 5 per-
cent during the 10 years ended June 2008.
It’s easy to get dizzy amid the flashing lights and loud music, and jump 
aboard the fund industry’s carousel of new products. But steer clear of the 
fancy stuff and stick to plain old conservative equity and bond funds with 
your serious long-term money, and you’ll end up ahead.
Load versus No-Load — The Great Divide
You can buy mutual funds in two main ways:
 
 Through a professional seller: You can get a salesperson such as a 
broker or financial planner to help. The broker has to earn a living, so 
you’ll almost certainly end up buying load funds — a load is a sales 
charge or commission that’s paid to the broker, either by you or by the 
fund company.
 
 Going it alone: You can pick your funds on your own, with perhaps some 
advice from a bank staffer or mutual fund employee. In that case, you’ll 
often end up buying no-load funds, which don’t levy a sales commission.
Grey areas abound. You can buy load funds on your own and pay no com-
missions (through a discount broker, which will provide little or no advice). 
Some brokers will sell you no-load funds or load funds on which they waive 
commissions. And banks can fall in between the two stools. But those are the 
two essential methods.

37
 Chapter 2: Buying and Selling Basics
Load funds — The comfort zone
Most mutual funds in Canada are sold to investors by a salesperson who is in 
turn paid by way of a sales commission. Millions of people love the feeling of 
having an advocate and adviser who seems to know his or her way through 
the jungle of investing. And why not hire a professional? After all, you proba-
bly don’t fix your plumbing yourself or remove your own appendix (too hard 
to get the stains out of the kitchen tiles).
Your adviser might work for a stockbroker, a financial planning firm, or an 
insurance brokerage — or he or she might be self-employed. But the impor-
tant point is this: If you buy funds through a salesperson, your primary rela-
tionship is with them, not with the fund company.
Any fund company should be able to answer your questions about your 
account. Always make sure you get a regular account statement from the 
fund company itself (unless you’re with one of the big stockbrokers; the big 
brokers usually handle all of the recordkeeping). But load companies, such 
as CI Funds, AIM Trimark, and Fidelity Investments Canada, won’t even sell 
you funds directly. You have to open an account with a broker or planner, 
who will then put the order through for you. The companies’ systems and 
much of their marketing are designed to deal with salespeople, not members 
of the public, so your buy and sell orders must come from your broker.
Seeing which companies sell load funds
Table 2-3 shows Canada’s 20 biggest mutual fund companies (excluding CI 
Funds) at the end of June 2008 and the method they use to sell their funds. As 
you can see, 11 of the 20 giants are load companies. Eight of the no-load sellers 
are banking institutions, and one sells funds only to doctors and their families.

Decoding sales commissions 
Sales commissions on load funds come in a bewildering number of variations 
and forms. And discount brokers have dreamed up even more ways to make 
the whole thing even more complicated (see Chapter 6 for details). But when 
you buy a load fund from a broker or planner, you have three basic options.
You can negotiate and pay an upfront commission — known as a sales charge 
or front load — to the salesperson. Savvy investors usually pay 2 percent or 
less. That entitles you to sell the fund at any time with no further charges, 
and it sometimes gets you lower annual expenses.
Alternately, you can buy funds on a “low-load” basis. Some firms refer to this 
as “no-load,” even though you must buy them through an adviser. There’s 
no free lunch, of course, as a low-load fund generally will have higher annual 
expenses than the front-end version of the same fund.
Finally, you can buy funds with a back-end load or redemption charge. In that 
case, the fund company itself pays the commission to the broker — usually 5 
percent in the case of an equity fund or a balanced fund and less for a bond 
fund. However, you, the investor, are on the hook for a “redemption charge” 
if you sell the fund within a set number of years. Table 2-4 shows the redemp-
tion charge formula for funds at Investors Group.

Note that Investors Group charges the same fee for redemptions made during 
the first two years following purchase; many other companies will charge 
less in the second year than the first. For example, Fidelity’s redemption 
charge in the first year is 6 percent, and 5.5 percent in years 2 and 3, before 
dropping to 4.5 percent in year 4.
The redemption charge is based either on the original purchase cost of the 
units you’re redeeming or their value at the time you sell. The policy varies 
by company. For example, Investors Group charges it on the value at the 
time of redemption, while Fidelity bases this fee on the value at the time of 
purchase. The first option is slightly better for you because, presumably, the 
value of your units will have increased by the time you redeem. For example, 
say you invest $10,000 in a fund on a back-end-load basis and the fund gains 
20 percent, leaving you with $12,000. Say you decide to redeem half of your 
holding, incurring a 4.5-percent back-end load. If the redemption charge is 
based on your original investment, you pay $225 (which is 4.5 percent of 
$5,000), but if it’s based on the current market value, you pay $270 (4.5 per-
cent of $6,000).
But a difficulty exists for the fund industry with back-end loads. If the adviser 
doesn’t have to wangle a commission out of the client every time he or she 
buys a fund, more of a temptation exists for brokers and planners to switch 
customers from fund to fund, collecting commissions from the fund compa-
nies along the way. So the fund industry borrowed a technique from the life 
insurers, who have been dealing with salespeople’s naughty tricks for gen-
erations, and introduced the trailer fee. Trailers are essentially yet another 
commission — usually between 0.5 percent and 1 percent of the value of the 
client’s holding annually — that’s paid by the company to the salesperson 
each year as long as his or her customer stays in the fund. It’s a payment 
for loyalty. The trailer comes out of the management fee, not out of your 
account, so you never see it.

40
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
Many load companies pay a higher trailer to salespeople when they sell the 
fund on a front-load basis, getting their sales commission directly from the 
investor. That’s because the company itself hasn’t had to pay the charge. So 
on front-load fund sales, where the investor negotiates and pays the com-
mission, a company might pay a trailer of 1 percent of the client’s holding of 
equity funds each year; but on deferred-load sales, where a company paid 
the original sales commission, the trailer might be only 0.5 percent. It all gets 
pretty confusing — and it gets more complicated as you go further in — but 
that’s the basis of the commission structure in mutual funds. Chapter 8 pro-
vides tips on how to deal with salespeople.
No-load funds — The direct approach
 
The other great branch of the fund industry is the no-load sector — funds 
that sell directly to the public with no sales commissions. Here, life is much 
simpler. A no-load shop will open an account for you when you contact them; 
you do this without the involvement of a broker, planner, or any other kind of 
adviser. You’re not charged to buy or sell a fund, although remember that to 
discourage in-and-out trading you often face a penalty of 2 percent or so if you 
dump a fund within three months of buying.
The banks dominate the no-load fund business through their vast customer 
bases, discount brokerage arms, and branch networks. Until recently they 
had difficulty building a strong record, and big market share, in equity funds. 
However, the Big Five banks have made gains in this area through improved 
performance and marketing through their branch networks, which has 
helped propel them to the top rungs of the fund-asset rankings.
Because no-load funds usually don’t pay sales commissions to brokers — 
although they sometimes pay trailer fees to persuade advisers to sell their 
funds — their annual expenses and fees should be much lower than those of 
load funds. Should be, but aren’t. Bankers aren’t known for cutting fees where 
they can get away with keeping them high, and most no-load funds in Canada 
are only slightly cheaper than broker-sold funds. In other words, you can 
expect to part with more than 2 percent of your assets each year when you 
invest in most equity or balanced funds, no matter where you buy them. Some 
bank-run equity funds charge less than 2 percent — mostly income-oriented 
dividend funds, which generally are less complicated to manage than more 
aggressive stock funds.

41
 Chapter 2: Buying and Selling Basics
The banks and a few other no-load-fund sellers also are the place to find 
index funds, which have ultra-low expenses — mostly less than 1 percent. An 
index fund costs very little to manage because its portfolio simply tracks the 
whole market by mimicking an index. These are known as passively managed 
funds, with no investment decisions necessary on the part of the managers. 
Because index funds generate such small management fees, load companies 
can’t afford to sell them and also pay commissions to brokers. See Chapter 15 
for more about index funds — and even less expensive passive investments 
known as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.
No-load fund sellers’ main bread and butter, like other fund companies, are 
actively managed funds — some of which also have relatively low expenses. 
An example is Phillips, Hager & North Ltd. of Vancouver, which has two 
excellent “actively managed” funds with expenses of less than 2 percent. 
Actively managed funds, unlike index funds, buy and sell particular stocks in 
an attempt to beat the market and other managers. However, no-load shops’ 
bargain funds often have relatively high minimum investments in order to 
keep costs low (servicing tiny accounts isn’t profitable, remember). PH&N 
requires a minimum account size of $25,000 with the company. See Chapter 9 
for more on dealing directly with no-load companies.
How an Irish charmer revolutionized 
the mutual fund
Until the late 1980s, investors had to cough up 
the sales charge for load mutual funds them-
selves — it ran as high as 10 percent of the 
investor’s money in some iniquitous cases. 
But in 1987 a brilliant fund marketer named Jim 
O’Donnell at Mackenzie Financial had a brain-
wave: Consumers loathed having to part with 
cash off the top just to pay a salesperson; they 
wanted to see all their money going to work for 
them right away. So why not have the company 
pay the commission to the broker and get the 
money back through the management fee?
There was at least one problem with the strat-
egy: Investors who hadn’t paid a sales charge 
upfront might be inclined to simply dump the 
fund whenever they wanted. They hadn’t paid a 
sales load, after all, so they wouldn’t feel like they 
were wasting the commission. So Mackenzie 
also introduced its redemption charges, which 
kicked in if you cashed out early. The back-end 
idea was a smash hit and the company’s first 
back-end-load fund, the Industrial Horizon Fund, 
attracted hundreds of millions of dollars within 
months of its launch in 1987. The rest of the load 
fund industry soon copied it.

E
ver get work done on your house and notice how contractors talk? They 
use expressions such as “six of one and half a dozen of another” or “you 
could do that,” and they’ll pound ’em out in a barrage that leaves you more 
confused than before. People in the investment business like to drone on in 
the same way. They produce documents that explain every angle and aspect, 
but skip the stuff you really want to know: Is this fund any good and how has 
it done?
Investors hate getting piles of paper in the mail, but the glossy brochures 
keep coming. To some extent, the verbiage isn’t the companies’ fault. 
Securities law obliges those selling investments to disclose trivia their clients 
couldn’t care less about. Still, it’s pretty simple to filter out the noise in the 
mailings you get from a fund company — and cut straight to the information 
that really matters. And the documents from fund companies have improved, 
especially prospectuses, the all-important fact sheets that tell you about the 
promise and perils of a fund before you buy it. Industry regulators have gone 
further, requiring fund companies to provide performance update reports, 
written in plain English, to unitholders twice a year.
In general, the documents and forms you have to deal with are pretty 
straightforward. Mutual fund forms are set up to be easy to fill out. Some spe-
cial questions apply for opening a registered retirement savings plan, or you 
may need to fill in sections of your tax return to report investment income 
and gains, but they tend to be simple.
In this chapter we go over the important paperwork, to demystify your account 
statement (the regular mailing that shows how you’re doing) and walk you 
through a simplified prospectus (the brochure that describes the fund). As 
always, what to watch out for are the costs loaded on your account — and we 
show you where to sniff around.

The big thing to decide straightaway is whether you’re investing inside a regis-
tered retirement savings plan — a special tax-sheltered account in which invest-
ment profits pile up tax-free — or in an ordinary, taxable account in which your 
money is subject to taxes (see Chapter 22 for more on how RRSPs work). You 
can expect to fill out two main types of forms when you buy mutual funds:
 
 An account application form — which may just be called a “retirement 
savings plan” form if it’s for an RRSP.
 
 A form allowing the fund company to take fixed amounts out of your bank 
account for investment in funds, if you’ve decided to start a regular invest-
ing program. People usually have the money taken out monthly, but some 
fund companies allow you to use different periods, such as every week.
 
Starting a program of regular investments of small amounts into even a con-
servative mutual fund is one of the best ways of getting rich painlessly. For 
example, putting just $100 each month into the Royal Bank of Canada’s biggest 
balanced fund (which holds a relatively stable mixture of stocks and bonds) 
from mid-1998 to mid-2008 left an investor with about $18,000.
Filling in your account (or RRSP) 
application form
When you decide to buy a mutual fund, the first thing you’ll be asked to fill 
out is an “account application” form — which tells the company who you 
are, what you want to buy, and how much you want to spend. An account is 
like a little shelf on which all your investments are kept at the broker’s or the 
mutual fund company’s office.
The account application is the document that tells the fund company the 
following:
 
 Your name
 
 Address
 
 Level of investment knowledge
 
 The amount of money you want to put into each fund
For investors, it’s actually one of the most useful and informative documents 
mutual fund sellers print. That’s because it contains hard information the fund 
company needs itself, so the new account form is free of vagueness and ver-
bosity. For example, in the space where the form asks how much you want to 
invest in each fund, it nearly always clearly states the minimum investment.

45
 Chapter 3: Paperwork and Your Rights
Before you agree to buy anything, have a good look at the application form. 
And if you have any questions at all, approach your seller for a clear explana-
tion. The form will also sometimes disclose what extra fees — such as charges 
for administration — you’re expected to cough up. That’s not a sudden attack 
of candour on the company’s part — it’s simply that the bureaucrats need to 
know how you’ll be paying, directly or by having it taken out of your account.
The form for opening a new account includes some odd-looking questions. 
The fund company or broker wants to know
 
 How experienced you are as an investor
 
 Your income
 
 Your net worth (the value of your personal assets after your debts are 
taken away)
They’re not just being nosy here. One of the pillars of provincial securities law 
is a requirement that people selling investments should recommend only secu-
rities that are suitable for the customer — a principle referred to in the jargon 
as Know Your Client or KYC. In fact, the account application form is often just 
referred to as the KYC. The idea is this: An elderly investor on a limited income 
shouldn’t have a big chunk of his or her portfolio rammed into a Low-Coupon 
Speculative High-Yield Unsecured Sub-Saharan Junk Bond Fund.
The KYC can be a useful protection for you if it turns out later that your 
adviser put you into funds that were too risky for your circumstances, but it 
also works to the salesperson’s advantage. He or she has an automatic out 
if you lost money on a volatile fund but you claimed when you opened the 
account that you knew a fair bit about investing. This is no place to put on a 
brave face — if you’re a complete novice, say so and be proud of it. Pretending 
to know more than you do could really get you into hot water here if a dispute 
erupts between you and your broker about an investment that went sour.
 
If you’re investing with a bank or other no-load, direct fund seller, the applica-
tion form will be issued by the company and it’ll be clear that your deposit’s 
going straight to them. But if you’re buying funds through a financial planner 
or other independent fund salesperson, make sure you fill out an application 
form issued by the fund company itself. For your own security and conve-
nience it’s important that you’re recorded as a customer on the books of the 
fund company, giving you an extra measure of protection if the dealer or finan-
cial planner makes an error or even runs into cash-flow or regulatory prob-
lems. For example, if you’re investing in a Franklin Templeton Investments 
Corp. fund, see that the form you fill out is a Franklin Templeton form.
When money is held on the books of the mutual fund company itself, the account 
is said to be in client name. In other words, the account bears the name of the 
individual investor at the head office of the fund company. It’s a good arrange-
ment for you because that way, if you ever have a dispute with your broker or 

46
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
you want to move your account elsewhere, your units and your name are in the 
fund company’s records, making it much easier to shift your money.
Nearly every big financial planning chain and mutual fund dealer is set up so that 
mutual fund units are held in client name on the books of the fund company. 
That means you can expect to get statements at least twice a year from both the 
dealer and the fund companies you’ve invested with; always check them against 
each other. However, with traditional stockbrokers such as RBC Dominion 
Securities Inc., or with discount brokers such as TD Waterhouse Inc., your 
money may be held only on the broker’s books. In that case, the fund company 
may have no record of your account. Wherever you invest, it usually pays to 
keep an eye on the securities listed for your account and the transactions shown.
 
Discount brokers and traditional stockbrokers tend to have sophisticated back 
offices or administration systems because their clients usually own stocks and 
bonds as well as funds. That means mutual funds are held in the same big pot 
as other securities, so these brokers don’t pass their clients names on to the 
mutual fund company. Unfortunately, that means the fund company may have 
no record of your investment, and therefore isn’t able to send you an annual 
and semi-annual statement of your personal holdings. That could make it harder 
to resolve any disputes with your broker over what you bought and how much 
it’s worth. And very early in your investing career, someone is certain to get 
an order wrong. As in any business, mistakes can happen when dealing with 
discount brokers, mutual fund companies, and fund dealers. However, the good 
news is that these are large organizations that have the resources to fix errors. 
But get everything in writing, retain copies of all of the forms you fill out, and 
keep brief notes of the orders you issue over the phone or online. Retain trans-
action confirmation numbers until you see evidence in your account that a pur-
chase or sale has been conducted properly and according to your wishes.
Getting confirmed
 
Fund companies are required to send you a confirmation or transaction slip 
in the mail a few days after a transaction. This document confirms you’ve 
purchased units and for what amount, and whether you bought them with an 
upfront or “front-end” commission, on a “low-load” basis, or with a back-end 
load or redemption charge (assuming it’s a fund that’s sold with commis-
sions). A back-end load or redemption charge applies when you sell fund 
units. Read the confirmation or transaction slip very carefully, and if you spot 
any errors, immediately contact the salesperson (or fund company, if you pur-
chased directly) to get the mistake fixed.
Also, when writing your cheque to pay for your funds, make it payable to the 
fund company. Or, if it must be made out to your adviser’s firm as opposed 
to the fund company, write “in trust” on the cheque. That gives you extra 
protection if the dealer hits financial problems, potentially tying your money 
up in bankruptcy proceedings.

47
 Chapter 3: Paperwork and Your Rights
 
The main thing, when you’ve decided what fund to buy, is keeping a brief note 
of what you asked for and what you were told. And hang on to copies, photo-
copies, or scanned images of everything. If a dispute arises, an investor who 
can calmly produce notes from his or her meetings with the adviser, along 
with copies of documents, will be taken far more seriously.
Prospectuses — Not Always Your Friend
A mutual fund prospectus is the document that must be given to you when 
you buy a mutual fund. It’s the crucial method the fund industry uses to set 
out the purpose of the fund, describe the fees, costs, and charges, and warn 
buyers of the risks involved in investing in the fund. Always ask to see the 
prospectus before you buy a fund (the salesperson should offer it) and then 
make sure you read at least these two sections:
 
 The investment objectives of the fund — that is, the sort of things it 
invests in.
 
 The charges and fees — if they aren’t clearly explained, then get your 
salesperson to help.
Prospectuses traditionally were written using vague language, laden with 
legalese or with so many technical terms that it was impossible to figure out 
whether a fund was worth buying. But during the past decade, securities 
regulators have forced fund companies to produce prospectuses and other 
documents that are clear and concise. Nowadays, prospectuses (and their 
new companions, management reports of fund performance) are summaries 
that allow investors to put their finger on important information quickly.
The prospectus itself actually comes in two parts. Part A is a very broad, catch-
all piece that serves to provide the bulk of the information required to inform 
you (and, perhaps more important, satisfy the lawyers that the regulatory 
requirements are being met). It covers absolutely every minute detail that could 
possibly be applied to all funds offered by a company. In some cases, such as 
when a fund company has various “families” or brands of funds, more than one 
Part A prospectus exists; be sure to obtain the one that applies to your fund.
A second document — somewhat predictably labelled Part B — provides 
information specific to your fund. Most fund companies have a list of Part B 
prospectuses, grouping related funds into individual documents. However, 
individual funds each have their own sections within this document. This is 
the part of the prospectus that contains the all-important historical perfor-
mance and portfolio holdings information. The third piece of the disclosure 
puzzle is the management report of fund performance (MRFP), which merci-
fully is a self-contained piece. (We talk about the MRFP in the next section.)

of course, he was innocent). You can probably guess what the lawyer told 
him: Keep your mouth shut. Try it — any lawyer will tell you the same. The 
point we’re trying to make here is that, innocent or guilty, the cops are not 
your friend when you’re a suspect. They defend society; they do a tough and 
thankless job and we’re glad they’re there to take a bullet for us. But if you’re 
arrested, the cops are not on your side. Your lawyer is your friend, as long 
as you pay your bill, so say nothing until he or she arrives. The mutual fund 
prospectus is not entirely your friend, or at least it’s not a true do-anything-
for-you, hoops-of-steel, give-you-her-last-smoke type of friend. The prospec-
tus, the document describing a mutual fund that’s given to purchasers, is 
designed to inform you, but it’s also there to protect the fund salesperson 
and fund company. Because after it’s been given to you, the law assumes 
you’ve been adequately warned about the dangers and disadvantages of the 
fund. No point whining about the losses on funny foreign currencies when 
you were told of the danger right there on page 137.
Mutual fund prospectuses — which usually cover all or at least several of the 
funds in a company’s lineup under one cover — have always contained the 
following information:
 
 The name of the fund and its investment objectives: For example, 
providing a steady income while preserving capital for a money market 
fund, or capital gains for a stock fund. Usually it’s a bland motherhood 
statement that tells you little — after all, it would be an odd equity fund 
that didn’t seek capital gains. Perhaps someday they’ll invent a fund that 
tries to lose as much money as possible, and also dream up a way to 
get investors to buy it. We hope we’re still alive to see it: no doubt the 
wretched thing will find itself stuck with shares that go up like a rocket!
 
 The risks of investing in the fund: A good prospectus will warn of the 
dangers of losing money in bonds if inflation returns or interest rates 
turn up. And you can count on seeing a warning that an equity fund 
will be vulnerable if the stock market tanks. Special warnings about 
the dangers of foreign funds are almost always included, such as the 
chance of currency losses if the Canadian dollar climbs relative to over-
seas currencies — a danger that countless investors who were heavily 
diversified in foreign funds discovered to be very real in recent years. 
And small-company fund prospectuses invariably point to the unpleas-
ant volatility and unique dangers of small stocks. But, once again, the 
risks section usually consists of stating the bleeding obvious, as our 
Australian friends would say.

 Chapter 3: Paperwork and Your Rights
 
 The company’s idea of an appropriate investor: Look for clues as to the 
sort of investor who should buy the fund and the sort who should avoid 
it. For example, Franklin Templeton Investments — one of the more con-
servative fund companies — warns prospective investors in its emerging 
markets fund that they must be “willing to accept high investment risk.” 
After reading that, you have no cause to whine if you get beaten up by 
volatile markets in Brazil, Russia, or Thailand. Sure enough, although 
Templeton Emerging Markets has made tons of money for its investors 
in recent years — including returns in excess of 20 percent in 2005 and 
2006 — it also has produced some spectacular losses in other years. 
Most infamously, it crashed 27 percent in 2000 — but the crash came on 
the heels of a 43 percent gain the year before!
 
 The costs and fees imposed on investors: By law you’ll find the manage-
ment fees for a fund and the expenses that have recently been charged 
to investors. You’ll also see any sales charges or commissions. Because 
most load funds can be bought with a front-end or a deferred load, you’ll 
usually find both options explained (refer to Chapter 2 for more about 
front-end and deferred-load funds). Along with the charges to investors, 
the prospectus must also list the commissions, annual fees, and other 
incentives given to salespeople. In principle, that’s a great idea because 
it tells fund buyers how their advisers may be biased or influenced. 
Unfortunately, though, disclosure of commissions is often hedged 
around with “up to” or “may,” leaving most investors no wiser than 
before. The prospectus also includes a table showing the hypothetical 
total of expenses and fees an investor in the fund could expect to pay 
over periods ranging from one to ten years. It’s a fairly useful indication 
as to how much mutual fund investing can cost.
Pulling out of the deal
A mutual fund prospectus (the term comes from 
a Latin word meaning “view”) is one of the cen-
tral pieces of mutual fund regulation. In fact, it’s 
considered so important that in most provinces 
you have two business days after you get the 
prospectus to cancel your purchase of a fund 
for any reason. So even if you pull on a clown 
costume and dance around as you demand your 
money back, they have to pay up, no matter how 
silly your explanation.
Interestingly, in many provinces you also have 
the right to cancel your mutual fund purchase 
within 48 hours of getting your order confirmation. 
But don’t expect the fund company or broker 
to welcome your business in the future if you 
cancel your order without a reasonable justifi-
cation. The law assumes that until you’ve had 
a chance to read the prospectus you haven’t 
been properly told about the fund. But after 
you’ve read it, you’re pretty well on your own. 
Unless you can show that the fund isn’t stick-
ing to the promises made in the prospectus, the 
people selling and running the fund can rea-
sonably argue that all the risks and expenses 
have been explained to you — and you’ll have 
a tough time cancelling your agreement to buy 
the fund.

Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
Prospectuses for bank-sold funds will also talk vaguely about “incentives” 
given to their employees, and nearly all mutual fund companies will reserve 
the right to “participate” (as one fund seller delicately puts it) in advertising 
by brokers and in “conferences” for salespeople. In other words, the fund 
managers hand over money to help brokers pay for these things. However, 
the good — or bad — old days of flying to Maui for a “seminar” at a fund com-
pany’s expense are over. The public, media, and regulators just got so tired 
of the piggery that the fund industry agreed to introduce a sales code, which 
bans the worst of the excesses.
 
Always remember that a fund company often has two sets of customers: its 
unitholders (the people who actually own the funds), and the brokers and 
financial planners who sell its wares. If a fund company doesn’t keep its sales 
people happy, it’s in trouble.
More charges to look for
Here are some of the other charges the prospectus must disclose:
 
 Fees for administering registered retirement savings plans, registered 
retirement income funds, and registered educational savings plans: 
These range from zero to about $75 annually. Ask if you can pay them 
separately by cheque — especially where it’ll save your precious RRSP 
dollars — but some companies claim that their systems are set up only to 
take the money directly out of your account (which is handier for them).
 
 Fees for closing your account and moving the money to another insti-
tution: Expect to pay $40 or $50.
 
 Fees for short-term trading: If you sell a fund within a short period after 
buying it, usually one to three months, you’ll often face a penalty of 2 
percent of the amount you sold. That’s because funds are supposed to 
be a long-term holding, and investors who hop on and off over and over 
again increase costs for everyone.
Introducing the Management Report 
of Fund Performance
In 2005, regulators forced the funds industry to produce annual and semi-
annual summaries of fund performance and holdings. These reports, called 
management reports of fund performance (MRFP), also include basic informa-
tion on the fund’s investment mandate and its recent risk experience, and, 
perhaps most useful of all, a discussion of the fund’s recent performance.

51
 Chapter 3: Paperwork and Your Rights
Although a fund company must provide you with a copy of a fund’s prospectus 
and its periodic MRFPs, the most recent MRFP is the only document you really 
need to read to gain a clear picture of a fund’s mandate and how the fund’s 
been faring. If the fund seller doesn’t give you a copy, ask for it or download it 
from the fund company’s Web site or from SEDAR, the official online deposi-
tary of all securities documents filed in Canada. (We discuss SEDAR more in 
this chapter as well as in Chapter 21, which covers fund research sources.)
Looking at what goes into an MRFP
An MRFP must contain certain information for the specified period and be 
presented in a prescribed sequence. The format ensures that consistent and 
up-to-date information will be available for every mutual fund sold in Canada. 
Here’s a summary of the information that must be included in an MRFP:
 
 Investment objectives: A summary of the fund’s fundamental investment 
objective and strategies.
 
 Risk experience: How changes to the investment fund over the financial 
year affected the overall level of risk associated with an investment in 
the investment fund.
 
 Results of operations: This section covers the fund’s performance during 
the period in question, as compared to its benchmark index. It sum-
marizes noteworthy changes in portfolio holdings, the impact of these 
changes on the fund’s stated objectives, and details of any borrowing in 
which the fund might have engaged. Portfolio holdings are expressed in 
terms of individual investments as well as industry sectors, geographic 
regions, bond investment quality, and currency, as applicable.
 
 Recent developments: This section includes a discussion of market 
events and how the fund’s overall strategies might have been amended 
(or not) to respond to the situation. It also must disclose any changes in 
portfolio managers, or in accounting policies.
 
 Related party transactions: Any transactions involving parties related to 
the fund must be disclosed.
 
 Financial highlights: These are tables showing a breakdown of the cal-
culation of the net asset value per share (NAVPS), various ratios includ-
ing the management expense ratio and portfolio turnover ratio.
 
 Management fees: A breakdown of the services received by the fund 
that constitute its management fees.
 
 Past performance: Tables show the fund’s rates of return for the past 
ten calendar years, plus one-, three-, five-, and ten-year compound 
annual returns.

52
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
When securities regulators first unveiled the MRFP concept, fund company 
executives, investment advisers, and investors all greeted it with groans because 
they feared it would be yet one more level of tedious and expensive documenta-
tion. But, in practice, MRFPs have turned out to be a source of pretty good infor-
mation, all presented in a document typically less than a dozen pages long.
Checking out an MRFP
Have a look at the 2007 annual MRFP for a large equity income fund, CI 
Signature Dividend. Figures 3-1 and 3-2 show some key information about the 
fund’s performance and portfolio holdings:
 
 Year-by-year returns: These are great for letting you know what kind of 
swings in value you can expect. These bar charts show returns for four 
classes of the CI Signature Dividend fund. The mainstream units, class 
A, had slightly lower returns than the other classes, which have lower 
annual expenses because they’re sold only by advisers who charge a 
separate management fee directly to their clients. Regardless of the 
class, the bars clearly denote the fund’s good years and bad.

Signature Dividend Fund
Management Report of Fund Performance for the year ended March 31, 2007
PAST PERFORMANCE
This section describes how the Fund has performed in the past. Remember, past
returns do not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. The information
shown assumes that distributions made by the Fund in the periods shown were
reinvested in additional units of the relevant classes of the Fund. In addition, the
information does not take into account sales, redemption, distribution or other
optional charges that would have reduced returns or performance.
Year-by-Year Returns
The following chart shows the Fund’s annual performance for each of the years
shown and illustrates how the performance has changed from year to year. In
percentage terms, the chart shows how much an investment made on the first day
of each financial year would have grown or decreased by the last day of each
financial year, except where noted.
Annual Compound Returns
The following table shows the Fund’s annual compound returns, compared to the
benchmark consisting of 60% S&P/TSX Composite Index and 40% BMO Capital
Markets 50 Preferred Shares Total Return Index 
The S&P/TSX Composite Index tracks the performance of approximately 220
stocks and trusts listed on The Toronto Stock Exchange. It may be the best broad
index available for Canadian equities. The indexes weighting is based on market
capitalization.  However, because of investment limits imposed on mutual funds
and varying investment approaches among portfolio advisors, it may be more
helpful to compare a fund’s performance to that of other mutual funds with similar
objectives and investment styles. 
The BMO Capital Markets 50 Preferred Shares Total Return Index is a market
capitalization weighted index that includes the 50 most liquid preferred issues with
a P3 rating by Standard & Poor's.
A discussion of the performance of the Fund as compared to the benchmark can
be found in the Results of Operations section of this report.

 Annual compound returns: This shows the rates of return, com-
pounded annually, over one-, three-, five-, and ten-year periods ended 
March 31, 2007. It also shows the fund’s compound annual return since 
its inception in October 1996, compared with the performance of two 
benchmark indices, the Standard & Poor’s/Toronto Stock Exchange 
composite index and the BMO Capital Markets 50 Preferred Shares 
Total Return Index. The former tracks the broad Canadian stock market, 
and the latter is a barometer of the performance of preferred shares. 
Preferreds, as they’re called, are the traditional form of dividend-paying 
stock, but nowadays fewer companies issue them, preferring (no pun 
intended) to pay dividends to shareholders via common stock. We’ll 
spare you a lengthy discussion on the reasons why — although the seri-
ous lag in performance by preferreds, as shown in this table, might have 
something to do with it. Suffice it to say that the BMO preferred index is 
a worthwhile benchmark to use in this case. Blended returns of the two 
indices also are provided. The A units (which are fee-inclusive and are 
what most people buy) have outperformed the blended index over the 
long term (10 years) but lagged the broader S&P/TSX.
 
 Portfolio breakdown: This table shows in which TSX sectors the fund 
invests, as well as other types of investments such as cash and options 
contracts. In CI Signature Dividend’s case, more than half the portfolio 
was in the Financials sector as of March 2007 — not surprising, given the 
fund’s mandate to produce dividend income.
What is the S&P/TSX composite index?
The S&P/TSX composite is Canada’s main 
stock market barometer, measuring the value of 
nearly 300 of our most important publicly traded 
companies, such as Royal Bank of Canada or 
Trans-Canada PipeLines Ltd. It’s a fine way of 
checking how good the returns from stocks 
in general have been. For example, the index 
climbed above 15,000 for the first time in May 
2008, doubling its value in less than five years. 
High prices for energy and other commodities 
have propelled the TSX’s surge.
Every country has benchmarks for measuring 
returns from its local stock market. The United 
States has the old-fashioned Dow Jones indus-
trial average, a relic of the 1800s that contains 
30 giant companies. But the more representa-
tive Standard & Poor’s index of 500 companies 
and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Stock 
Market Composite Index also exist. The wild-
est index name we’ve come across is Finland’s: 
The Hex index.
The S&P/TSX composite used to contain a fixed 
300 companies — when it was known as the 
TSE 300 — but the Canadian market turned out 
to be too small to produce 300 companies large 
enough for big pension funds and mutual funds 
to invest in. After persistent criticism that the 
index was full of little stocks that were hard 
to trade, the exchange brought in Standard 
& Poor’s Corp. of New York to redesign the 
market benchmark. The revamped edition was 
launched in 2002. These days, the index has 
no fixed number of stocks — as of mid-2008, it 
contained approximately 260 companies.

 Top-25 holdings: The big holdings of an equity fund represent the 
manager’s true loves. They’re a reliable guide to the personality of the 
fund. Check ’em out — if they’re natural resource producers or small 
companies you’ve never heard of, or bonds issued by technology outfits 
or developing nations, you’re in for interesting times, as the old Chinese 
curse puts it. The top holdings of CI Signature Dividend are all big blue 
companies that normally pay dividends. Their shares aren’t likely to 
shoot up ten times in value, but they’re not likely to go bust either.
The financial section (see Figure 3-3) has some lines of tabular data well 
worth noting, specifically the following:
 
 Net assets: Asset growth (or shrinkage) is a key indicator of a fund’s 
health. As you can see, this fund’s assets have leaped in recent years, 
due to the strong showing by Canadian stocks as well as in response to 
investors’ thirst for income-producing investments.
 
 Management expense ratio (MER): This is useful information when 
you’re looking for low-cost funds (and you are). Seeing the figures for 
five years shows whether the fund company has been able to reduce its 
MER, particularly if its assets have risen significantly. In mutual funds, 
economies of scale don’t seem to apply. But, in this case, bravo to CI: 
Signature Dividend’s MER has come down a bit.

The mysterious annual information form
Pick up any mutual fund prospectus and you’ll 
notice that it’s referred to as the “simplified” 
version. As you get further into mutual funds, 
and hopefully more interested in them, you 
might get a hankering to look at the “compli-
cated” version. Well, actually, no such thing 
exists. The prospectus given to investors is 
called “simplified” because it’s only part of the 
full prospectus document: The rest of it, techni-
cally speaking, is the fund’s annual and semi-
annual statements and a little-known document 
called the “annual information form.” The AIF is 
available if you ask for it (the prospectus should 
provide a contact address or phone number), or 
you can download it from the Internet at www.
sedar.com, the central clearinghouse where 
just about all Canadian public companies and 
mutual funds must file their reports and other 
required disclosure documents. The AIF con-
tains things like the names of the trustees for 
the funds (who are supposed to be looking out 
for the interest of the investors), more detail 
on the commissions paid to brokers and other 
salespeople, and a bit more information about 
the outside portfolio managers hired to help run 
the funds.

56
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
 
 Portfolio turnover rate: This measures the speed at which the man-
ager changes the fund’s holdings — a 100-percent turnover rate is high, 
indicating that trading equivalent to the value of the entire fund took 
place during the year. High turnover in a fund, of course, means higher 
transaction costs and greater expenses to the fund. This value has been 
a staple of U.S. fund reporting for years and was adopted as a Canadian 
requirement during the recent reporting upgrade. As for our example, 
CI Signature Dividend’s turnover rate has been fairly low, no doubt a 
contributing factor to its lower MER.
Your Account Statement
Account statements, which show how much your holdings are worth and how 
much you’ve bought and sold since the last report from your fund company, 
are one area where the fund industry still needs to make progress. Investors 
often have trouble understanding what they actually own and even more dif-
ficulty figuring out their rates of return. Every company uses its own system 
and layout, and jargon such as “book value” isn’t much help.
You may get an account statement only twice a year if you invest through a 
stockbroker or financial planner. The broker or planner and the fund com-
pany you’ve used will often both send you statements for the six months 
ending June 30 and for the year ending December 31. Usually the people who 
invest through a salesperson aren’t interested in monitoring their invest-
ments frequently (that’s why they hired someone to advise them), so twice-
yearly statements are fine. Sometimes, a company will agree to send you 
statements more frequently — so try asking — but the fund seller’s system 
may not be set up to do this. However, as more brokerages and planning 
firms make statement downloading available via their Web sites, monthly fre-
quency is becoming more common.
If you hold your funds directly with a bank or no-load company, then you’ll 
probably get a statement every quarter. That’s because investors who go 
directly to their bank or to a fund company usually enjoy making their own 
decisions about investing — so they want to check their holdings more 
frequently. Finally, if you invest through a discount broker, your statement 
will often arrive monthly, especially if you’ve done some buying or selling 
in your account during the previous month. Discount brokerage customers 
tend to be very interested in investing, so they insist on regular updates. All 
companies still send out account statements, but just about every large fund 
seller also now lets you check your account and recent transactions over the 
phone or at their Internet site.
Besides your name, address, account number, and the nature of your 
account (that is, taxable or tax-deferred), your statement will almost cer-
tainly show the following:

57
 Chapter 3: Paperwork and Your Rights
 
 The total value of your investment in each fund you hold, plus a total 
value for your account.
 
 The number of fund units you held and their price or net asset value at 
the end of the reporting period. Remember to check these against the 
unit value shown for the fund in your newspaper’s monthly report for 
the period — and it’s not a bad idea to verify that the number of units 
matches the number shown in your previous statement, adjusting for 
any sales or purchases you may have made or for any distributions (in 
the form of new units) the fund declared.
 
 Any purchases or redemptions of units, and at what prices.
Beyond that, statements vary, but many big fund companies also provide the 
following information:
 
 The change in the value of your account, and ideally of your investment 
in each fund, since your last statement.
 
 The book value of your holdings. This technically means the amount 
you’ve ever put into the fund, which is useful for calculating whether 
you’re using up your complete foreign content limit in a tax-sheltered 
plan. That’s because the foreign content is calculated as a percentage of 
the book value, not of the current market value.
Some more service-oriented firms calculate compound rates of return for 
client portfolios. Although we think this should be a standard service in this 
era of high technology and regulation, it is an extreme exception to the rule. 
If your adviser provides this information to you, express how much you 
appreciate it. If on the other hand they don’t provide portfolio compounded 
returns, bug them about doing so.
Annual and Semi-Annual Financial 
Statements (Or Annual Reports)
At least once a year, a glossy brochure turns up in the mail filled with rows 
of dull-looking figures and dry terms such as “statements of operations” or, 
Andrew’s favourite, “net realized gain (loss) on sale of investment (excluding 
short-term notes).” These are the fund’s financial statements, which, like the 
prospectus, usually group several funds into one document. Fund companies 
produce the statements twice a year. They have to send the report for the 
fund’s financial year-end to all unitholders, but they’re generally allowed to 
send the half-year report only to investors who actually request it. There 
should be a mail-in card for you to do this. Unless this stuff really puts you 
to sleep, ask to have the six-month report mailed to you. You’ll be reminding 
the fund company that you take your money seriously.

58
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
Getting worked up about the financial details in the statements is pointless, 
but some important items to check include the following:
 
 The report must show the complete portfolio for the fund, not just the 
top holdings. It’s worth it, and interesting, to glance down the list to see 
if the manager has any funny-looking stuff that may be an attempt to jazz 
up performance while taking on more risk. The full portfolio listing will 
also show how much the fund paid for each stock and bond and what 
it’s worth now: It’s always fun to see which investment has proved to 
be a disaster for the fund, although managers often “window dress” by 
dumping a turkey so it doesn’t show up in the report.
 
 The statements often contain a commentary by the manager or fund 
company on what went right or wrong for the fund. As usual with mutual 
fund handouts, these tend to be bland and boring descriptions of the 
market or economic outlook, rather than an honest discussion of the 
manager’s good and bad moves. But look for some important clues. If 
the portfolio manager has been replaced or if the fund’s strategy is being 
changed in a major way, it may be time to dump it. And keep an eye on 
the top holdings. If they look riskier than you want, or if they leave out 
major sectors of the economy, then the fund company may be rolling 
the dice in order to jack up returns and attract more investors.
Don’t throw the book value at your manager
Be careful when comparing the book value of 
your investment in a fund with its market value. 
The book value is the total sum that’s been put 
into the fund, so in that sense it represents your 
total investment. But it also includes the value 
of any distributions made by the fund in the 
form of new units, even though they weren’t 
real investments that came out of your pocket. 
The reinvested distributions have the effect of 
increasing the book value, and they can make 
it grow larger than the market value — making 
it appear the fund has lost you money when 
it may have been a winner. For example, say 
you originally invest $10,000 in a fund that pro-
duces a return of 20 percent, leaving you with 
a market value of $12,000. But say the manager 
is an active trader and she pays out $4,000 in 
capital gains distributions along the way. Then 
your fund could have a book value of $14,000, 
or $2,000 more than its market value on your 
statement, even though the manager has done 
a good job.

M
utual funds, when selected carefully, are great for almost everyone and 
work best as part of an overall financial plan. You need to consider 
some important factors before jumping right in, however. The most important 
is taking a frank look at your financial health. Good financial planning isn’t 
rocket science and doesn’t have to be scary. It starts with getting your debt 
under control and buying enough insurance. Still, for those who have their act 
together and want to save and invest money, funds are a powerful ally.
Mutual funds are ideal for building retirement savings. Make sure you buy plenty 
of funds that invest in high-quality shares and bonds, and you will have found a 
simple and painless way of taking advantage of the high returns earned by most 
professional investors. Yes, share and bond prices drop from time to time, but if 
you don’t need the money for years, you have enough time to ride it out.
Funds aren’t just for retirement savings, however: They’re also ideal if your life 
is in a holding pattern — trying to find someone special or figuring out whether 
to move to another country for a while. In that case, you simply buy a less-
volatile set of mutual funds and sit tight. Funds are also just the ticket for build-
ing your short-term savings in order to make a big purchase, maybe your first 
home. In that case, you want no risk and a nice steady return. Whatever you’re 
chasing in life, funds are a valuable ally above all for their convenience and 
ease of recordkeeping — just always keep an eye on your statement.

60
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
Mutual funds are also perfect if you’re working toward early retirement but 
haven’t yet made up your mind when to quit — that’s because they can be 
shuffled and changed around with ease as your plans change. Funds are per-
fect for almost any financial plan because they’re such a maintenance-free 
and relatively low-cost way of storing and accumulating wealth. Running your 
own business or buying real estate properties might produce higher returns 
and lucrative tax write-offs, but being self-employed represents a 24-hour 
commitment — and whining tenants who call about the drains at 4 a.m. get 
annoying after a while. Funds are problem-free and easy to monitor, and they 
produce excellent returns if you keep management fees and costs down.
In short, funds are for dealing with your savings, the money you have left 
over after feeding, housing, and clothing your family and taking care of your 
own bloated desires. Most people want to do one of three things with their 
savings, or at least a mixture of these three: Grow a big nest egg for retiring, 
put money in safekeeping with a reasonable return because they don’t know 
what their ultimate plans will be, or, finally, save money for a short-term pur-
pose like buying a first home.
In other words, they want funds to grow their money over the long term, for 
several years or more; to give them a reasonable rate of return while avoiding 
big losses; or to simply hold their money safely with a modest annual payoff. 
In this chapter, we walk you through using funds to achieve each of the three 
goals. We outline the best way to set your objectives, help you identify what 
kind of investor you are, and show you how to start building a suitable port-
folio of funds.
Looking at Your Long-Term 
Financial Future
Your first step is to relax, grab a giant plate of poutine, and remember you 
live in the best country in the world. If you’re working and paying into the 
Canada Pension Plan (CPP) — and have a reasonable prospect of doing so 
until you’re 60 or so — then you’re unlikely to end up in absolute poverty. 
If you’re in a pension plan sponsored by a company, union, or professional 
association, so much the better. If you can build even some modest savings 
on top of that — a lump sum equivalent to your final year’s income, say — 
then you really shouldn’t have any problems getting by in retirement. But 
you’re no doubt planning to buy something nice near the water or take some 
agreeable cruises, and, for that stuff, just “getting by” won’t cut it. So even 
if you have a good pension and full government benefits coming your way, 
you’ll need cash to kick-start things. And if you’re not in a pension plan, you 
certainly want to be accumulating your own rainy-day fund.

61
 Chapter 4: Building Your Very Own Financial Plan
No clear-cut science exists for determining how much you need to save for 
retirement, but you don’t want to find out that you hugely underestimated 
your needs. Don’t panic: The government may reduce benefits, but seniors 
are a powerful, organized lobby and, most of all, they vote. So it’s a near-
certainty that the government will provide some kind of pension when you 
retire. The greying baby boomers will see to it. But unless you want to spend 
a lot of time kicking around the local mall, like you do now, then a lump sum 
will come in handy.
Many experts claim that you should try to generate an after-tax income — 
including all pensions and government benefits — equal to about 70 percent 
of your present net income.
And the conventional assumption for many planners is that you ignore the 
value of your home (if you own it, of course) when calculating your wealth in 
retirement. That’s because planners often treat the value of an investor’s home 
as an insurance policy that might be needed for medical expenses and so on.
Mind you, those guidelines are pretty extreme. Many people get by on much 
less than 70 percent of their former net income when they quit work. And a 
lot of people will be able to sell their family home for a tidy sum, leaving them 
with a healthy tax-free profit when they move into something smaller. Still, 
the rules represent an ideal to aim for.
 
Just about everybody in Canada with a paying job, including the self-
employed, is covered by the CPP. That’s the federal government–sponsored 
pension plan, which you pay for by making contributions throughout your 
working life. The very similar Quebec Pension Plan exists for those working in 
Quebec.
For 2008, the maximum monthly benefit payable under the CPP for those 
aged 65 was $884.58, payable for life and increasing in line with inflation.
On top of that is Old Age Security, a pension provided to all Canadians over 
65 who’ve lived in this country long enough. As of July 2002 it was $505.83 a 
month. Finally, the Guaranteed Income Supplement is for low-income seniors, 
which is something you won’t have to worry about if you heed the advice in 
this book and become a successful mutual fund investor.
Now, obviously, you’d be hard-pressed to live off those amounts from the 
government. But look at seniors all around you. Especially at your par-
ents, relatives, and friends. Notice how they seem to be, well, comfortable? 
That’s largely because, when they retired, their expenses were significantly 
reduced. More specifically:
 
✓ When you stop working, your house will almost certainly have been paid 
for, leaving you free of accommodation costs apart from utilities and 
maintenance.

62
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
 
✓ Your employment expenses, including transportation, parking, and 
clothing, will fall to nothing.
 
✓ Sure you’ll want to travel, but now you can take advantage of off-peak 
discounts and other special reductions. And, let’s face it, you’ll be 
slowing down.
 
✓ Your kids will almost certainly have flown the nest and their education 
will be just about paid for. No more pimple-faced, sullen . . . well, you 
know.
In other words, before you assume you face an old age of penury — mean-
ing you think you automatically have to put the very maximum into your 
wretched registered retirement savings plan — remember that you’ll have 
spent a lifetime living frugally already, earning enough to pay your taxes and 
mortgage and bankroll the kids’ hockey skates and education. That said, the 
best way to ensure you’ll be free of financial worries in the years to come 
is to plan carefully and pay attention to your finances. By using investment 
options like mutual funds, you can make your retirement a better experience. 
You’ll feel more flush with cash and be able to travel, shop, and generally 
relax in high style. Plus, investing isn’t all about your day in the sun; sound 
investments can help you meet many of your life goals, like educating your-
self and your children, buying your dream home, starting your own business, 
and much, much more.
 
Start saving now, today, because the younger you are the more powerful the 
effect of buying mutual funds. Yes, you’ll probably get by in retirement, but 
starting a regular contribution plan to a fund at an early age can earn you 
thousands of dollars. Let’s say you’d put $100 monthly into Scotia Global 
Growth Fund for five straight years, from June 2003 to June 2008: You’d have 
ended up with more than $6,000. But if you’d started five years earlier, in June 
1998, you’d be sitting on a lot more — $11,000 or so.
Meet the Cleavers: Last-minute savers 
who did just fine
Actuaries — pension and life insurance experts 
who work on cheerful questions such as when 
you can expect to die — get a lot of ribbing for 
being dull. Even accountants, not exactly known 
for their excess of personality, like to make jokes 
about them. But some actuaries are a lot of fun. 
Especially Malcolm Hamilton, a retirement expert 
with the consulting firm William M. Mercer Ltd. in 
Toronto. He accuses the investment and savings 
industries of scare tactics, especially with their 
pious assertion that you’ll need 70 percent (or even 
80 percent) of your pre-retirement income when 
you retire. Mr. Hamilton says that’s a load of bull, 
and that people get by on as little as one-third of 
their gross working income. That’s because many 
living costs — such as employment expenses, 
kids, mortgage, and, most of all, taxes — 
disappear. Here’s an example of what he 
means, adapted from his description of a 
typical Canadian couple.

63
 Chapter 4: Building Your Very Own Financial Plan
Take the Cleavers, a couple who just got married 
at 25. They have a combined income of $60,000, 
roughly in the middle for Canadians. Of that, 
$20,000 goes in taxes, employment expenses, 
and savings for their first home. This leaves the 
Cleavers with $40,000 to spend on themselves.
Ten years later, the Cleavers have two kids and 
a $300,000 home. They now make $100,000 each 
year, of which taxes, employment expenses, 
RESP contributions, and mortgage payments eat 
up $45,000. The kids cost them another $15,000. 
That leaves the Cleavers with the same $40,000 
to spend on themselves. They save nothing for 
retirement. Ten more years later, in their mid-
forties, they can finally begin diverting money 
to their RRSPs, accelerating the pace when the 
children go to college. And all of those RRSP 
contributions generate huge tax savings. By age 
54, the Cleavers are earning $120,000 annually, 
of which $65,000 goes to RRSPs (they’re able to 
put such large quantities into their plans because 
they have years of unused contributions). Taxes 
and employment expenses consume $15,000. 
On themselves, the Cleavers spend the same 
old $40,000. So at 55, with a house and $600,000 
of retirement savings, the Cleavers retire. They 
reckon that their savings, the CPP, and Old Age 
Security will give them an inflation-protected 
income of $44,000 per annum. Does that mean 
they’re living in poverty? No, says Mr. Hamilton, 
and here’s where he starts having fun.
In his words, “Financial planners warn that the 
same fate awaits others who don’t save millions. 
‘Look at the feckless Cleavers,’ they say. ‘They 
used to earn $120,000 per annum; now they sub-
sist on $44,000.’
“For the record, the Cleavers’ finances . . . are 
remarkably simple after retirement: $44,000 of 
income, less $4,000 of income tax, leaves $40,000 
for the Cleavers to spend on themselves, just as 
they always have — just as they always will. The 
Cleavers’ version of Freedom 55 is not the one 
you see on television. They will not winter in the 
Caribbean, nor will they enjoy that sunset view 
of the Pacific. Their riches are measured in lei-
sure time, not dollars. And since the government 
hasn’t found a way to tax leisure, the Cleavers 
live well and pay little or no tax.”
The moral of the story: Your costs will fall off a 
cliff when you retire, so don’t get spooked into 
diverting every spare penny into your RRSP. 
Sure, saving is good — and it’ll get easier as the 
kids leave and the house is paid off. But always 
question the assumption that you’ll need 70 
percent of your pre-retirement income.
Setting Your Financial Priorities
Pick up any of the piles of unwanted personal finance books in the store and 
they all begin by saying the same thing, mainly because it’s true: Pay your 
debts.

64
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
That’s the first step for anyone, and often the most difficult. Remember that if 
you’re shelling out $100 in credit card interest each month and you’re in a 50 
percent tax and deductions bracket on your uppermost income, then it takes 
$200 in earnings to pay for that sucker.
Building wealth with debt bleeding you dry is impossible, so — with the 
exception of your home mortgage — becoming borrowing-free is the first 
move. That’s difficult, but it’s the first step toward freedom.
I gave at the office: Making a contribution at work
If you’re working for a large company or for the 
government, and they offer a traditional defined 
benefit plan, it’s usually a good idea to sign on 
for it. These plans usually provide a signifi-
cant pension income, and they are becoming 
harder and harder to find as many employers 
stop offering them in favour of less expensive 
defined contribution plans and group RRSPs. A 
defined benefit plan is a pension that promises 
to pay a percentage of your salary when you 
leave. A typical generous scheme might offer 2 
percent times years of service times the aver-
age of your best (or last) 5 years of income. 
So if you worked for 35 years, with the best 5 
years averaging $50,000 each, your annual pen-
sion would be 2 percent times 35 times $50,000, 
which works out at $35,000 a year. When you’re 
negotiating with a new employer, look for a 
pension that’s at least this good — or seek 
compensation for not getting it.
Sure, you might do better investing on your own 
rather than making contributions to the pension 
scheme — and being in a pension plan reduces 
the amount you can put into your own RRSP — 
but for people who are poor savers, a pension 
scheme is a wonderful backup. It’s especially 
important to get into a pension plan if you’re 
over 40, and certainly if you plan to stay with 
the employer after age 50. That’s because the 
actual value of being in a defined-benefit plan 
shoots up exponentially as soon as you reach 
middle age (because your quitting date is draw-
ing closer).
If you’re leaving a job early, it’s frequently a 
good idea to stay in the plan rather than take a 
lump sum. Pension benefits are often increased 
in line with inflation, either formally or by way 
of goodwill payments, and pension schemes 
also may bring you health benefits. At least ask 
the human resources people to explain how 
much you’ll get in dollar terms if you leave your 
accrued contributions in the scheme and then 
collect a reduced pension later at 55, 60, or 65. 
If you can, show the projections to an accoun-
tant who’s knowledgeable about pensions or, 
better yet, call up a firm of actuaries. See if you 
can persuade one to give you an hour or two of 
advice for an agreed fee of, say, $300 or $400. It’ll 
be money well spent. Just as it’s wise to always 
have your lawyer by your side before you talk 
to the cops, it’s good to have your own expert 
looking out for you when dealing with some-
thing as complicated as a pension. A corpora-
tion is happy to see you take a lump sum and 
stumble off into the night, with no more claim on 
them. But it could be a lot better for you to stay 
in line for a pension down the road, at 55, for 
example. So ask the other old codgers at work 
what they’re doing (they’re usually pretty savvy) 
and stick around in the scheme if you can.

65
 Chapter 4: Building Your Very Own Financial Plan
 
Fund salespeople and even banks will often suggest you borrow money to buy 
mutual funds. This is known as leveraging your investment and it works out 
fine as long as the funds go up in value. But remember that if the funds drop, 
you’ll still be on the hook for every penny you borrowed to buy them. So think 
long and hard before taking out a loan in order to buy mutual funds that invest 
in stocks and bonds.
Here, roughly in order, are the priorities to set on your road to fiscal 
responsibility:
 
1. Pay off your debts: Start with the high-interest and non–tax-deductible 
kind.
 
2. Get life insurance: Buy enough insurance to provide for your loved 
ones if they lose you, and buy fire and theft coverage for your home and 
property.
 
 Get quotes on disability insurance. This insurance will provide at least 
some income if you can’t work. If your job doesn’t provide any coverage, 
then it’s a must, especially if your household has only one wage earner.
 
3. Set up an emergency fund: Make sure you have access to some cash if 
an emergency hits. Traditionally, experts advise six months’ income.
 
4. Have a will drawn up: Save everybody a lot of hassle and delay (at a 
horrible time) by biting the bullet and getting this done. If you have a 
very straightforward situation, a lawyer (or in Quebec, alternatively, a 
notary) might be able to prepare a will for about $300 to $500.
 
5. Hire an accountant or other fee-charging expert: For a charge that can 
be as low as $200 or $300 they will look over your tax situation. If you do 
any kind of freelance work or earn any sort of self-employment income, 
this step is essential (unless your income is so low you can’t afford it).
 
Only when you’ve completed those steps should you think about saving and 
investing money, including buying mutual funds. And here you’ll run into one 
of the main problems with the way mutual funds are sold: They’re a wonder-
ful product, but financial planners and other advisers who earn commissions 
from funds don’t get paid for telling clients to cut their debts and buy insur-
ance. So they see buying funds as the solution to just about everybody’s prob-
lem, at the risk of leaving customers underinsured or paying far too much in 
interest on their debts. That’s why we recommend you remember that anyone 
who sells mutual funds for a living has a natural in-built bias. It’s also why in 
Part II of this book, where we take a close look at financial planners, we rec-
ommend you think strongly about going to a fee-charging financial planner or 
accountant who doesn’t get commissions for selling products.

Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
Understanding What Type 
of Investor You Are
So you’ve decided to build some capital. Mutual funds are the most conve-
nient way to do it. The next question is what you’ll need the money for. And 
here’s where you can build funds into your financial plan. After your debts 
and spending are under control, and you’ve bought adequate insurance and 
tax advice, the next step is to set goals. Most people have financial objectives 
that fall into one of these three groups. Chances are your situation fits one of 
the following descriptions, or it’s a blend of two of them:
 
✓ Growth investors are building a portfolio of long-term savings that are sup-
posed to last through retirement or through an extended and far-off period 
of not working. In that case, it doesn’t really matter if the stock market 
goes into long slumps — it can even be to your advantage if you’re steadily 
investing all the while, because you get to buy stocks cheaply. The real 
danger is having your money eroded by inflation. So the goal is maximum 
growth, and that means lots of equity funds with a relatively small propor-
tion of the portfolio in bonds in order to spread your risk. Growth investors 
are the greediest of all: They typically chase annual returns of 8 percent or 
more, and are willing to expose their portfolio to danger in order to get it.
 
✓ Balanced investors aren’t sure what’s likely to happen in their life, but 
it could include buying a home, moving to an exotic locale, or starting a 
family. But whatever the eventual goal is, it’s definitely going to require 
a few thousand dollars. In that case, caution is the watchword. You 
might need the money soon, and it would be awful to have to sell your 
mutual funds straight after the stock market collapsed, scything into 
their value. So the best formula is lots of money market funds and bond 
funds, with a modest equity component if you’re comfortable taking on 
some risk. Balanced investors are generally happy with returns of 4 to 7 
percent annually.
 
✓ Savers are amassing a pile of money to buy a home or car within the 
next few years, or building a war-chest so they can stop working for a 
while, perhaps to go back to school or to dig for ancient pornographic 
mosaics in old Thrace. If you’re one of these people then you want to 
keep risk to a minimum, because this is money you’ll be needing very 
soon. That means no stocks, or hardly any, and lots of short-term bonds 
and money market securities. Savers traditionally will settle for annual 
rates of return of 4 percent or less, as long as their money isn’t at risk.
For all three types of investor, mutual funds are a wonderful tool. They’re 
cheap or free to buy, flexible, and convenient. The fund company handles all 
the recordkeeping, which means funds require little or no thought or attention 
from the investor (but do check your statement carefully). And funds offer 
attractive rates of return. So decide which goal matches yours, and then look 
at the suggested sample portfolios at the end of this chapter for some ideas.

 Chapter 4: Building Your Very Own Financial Plan
Understanding That Investing 
Is an Inexact Science
Okay, so we’re going to give you the straight goods. Even reporting on 
financial markets daily doesn’t shield us from the inevitable hits and misses 
every investor encounters when he or she throws his or her hat in the ring. 
Andrew’s investing career began in the mid-1990s, when he opened a self-
directed RRSP at Toronto-Dominion’s discount brokerage, then called Green 
Line Investor Services but now known as TD Waterhouse. We’ll spare you all 
the details of his expensive education, but here are a few lowlights:
 
✓ Andrew thought a company called Pallet Pallet — which was trying to con-
solidate the vibrant and exciting market for wooden warehouse pallets — 
was a turnaround possibility. The company’s stock had plunged to pennies 
after it tried to grow too fast and ran into soaring costs. Needless to say, the 
pallet industry turned out to be fragmented into tiny mom-and-pop opera-
tions for some very good reasons. (Andrew never really found out what 
they are, though. He’s sure a sitcom is in there somewhere.) And he ended 
up selling his Pallet Pallet shares at a loss.
 
✓ He decided that flying basket-case Canadian Airlines was another recov-
ery candidate — but being the greatest market strategist of the late 
20th century, he was too clever to bother with the company’s boring 
common stock. No, he bought warrants, a speculative sort of certificate 
that gains real value only if the underlying shares climb. Climb a lot, that 
is. They didn’t and he lost more money.
Dealing with documents
What about all that mail, both paper and elec-
tronic, you receive from your broker and fund 
company. What should you keep? All you really 
need to keep are brokerage statements and 
transaction slips. Retain them for several years, 
especially if taxable transactions are involved. 
The mailings are easy to clip together with a big 
bulldog clip, in order by date. Use one clip for 
the current year and then attach all the previous 
years together using another.
If you’re fortunate enough to be able to 
avoid paper statements and transaction slips 
altogether and pick them up by logging on to the 
broker’s or fund company’s Web site, make sure 
you will have ongoing access to these docu-
ments. If not, save them as PDF files and set up 
a logical filing system on your computer — and 
back it up regularly. If electronic storage scares 
the wits out of you, then throw in the towel and 
print them. You’ll have to live with the fact that 
you’re using up paper and filing space — and let-
ting the broker or fund company escape postage 
and paper costs.

68
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
 
✓ Andrew reckoned Asia was in for a major bounce back from its sell-off of 
1994, when the average Asian fund dropped 11 percent. So he plunged 
into madcap Asian mutual funds. Asian markets promptly went into a 
four-year slump, culminating in the near economic meltdown of 1998. 
After a while, he stopped looking at his returns.
Okay, Andrew had a couple of successes in technology stocks that actually 
popped up like they were supposed to. But he has found that funds are the 
way to go, for him anyway. His mainstream Canadian equity funds — which 
he once despised as ballast in his scheme for world financial control — have 
proved to be his best investment. And even Andrew’s speculative resource and 
Asian funds have finally bounced back to something like the price at which he 
bought them — after he stopped looking at them. Andrew wishes he’d bought 
dull global equity funds instead; he would have made a lot more money.
For some reason, Andrew’s portfolio seems to thrive when he ignores 
it and just gets on with his life. When he attempts to fiddle and fuss and 
apply his master strategies, it all goes wrong again. So now he does what 
most Canadians do: He just checks the statement and files it in a drawer. 
Periodically, Andrew looks at his funds’ performance and main holdings, but 
otherwise he lets the pros get on with their jobs. After all, why hire a plumber 
and then go around yourself with droopy pants hanging off your backside? 
The moral of this story: Prepare yourself for the fact that your best-laid plans, 
including can’t-miss investments, can suddenly go awry. Prepare yourself for 
this probability and you’ll not only sleep better, but also be able to afford a 
more expensive mattress.
Borrowing for RRSPs
Borrowing to invest can be a good idea if you 
plan to put the money into your RRSP — that’s 
because contributions to an RRSP can be used 
to reduce your taxable income, generating lucra-
tive tax savings for you. You can then use the tax 
refund you get to pay off some of the loan: Banks 
even have RRSP loan-marketing schemes based 
on this strategy. And remember that when it’s in 
the RRSP, the money grows tax-free.
Still, even though taking out an RRSP loan offers 
advantages, experts often advise that you limit 
your borrowing to an amount you can pay off 
in one or two years. If you’re borrowing money 
to invest outside an RRSP, then the interest 
you pay on the loan can be written off as an 
expense for tax purposes, even if your invest-
ments tank. But because the government con-
siders RRSPs to be such a generous tax break, 
interest you pay on a loan taken out for an RRSP 
contribution can’t be used as a tax deduction. 
Don’t let the tax sweetener blind you to the fact 
that playing with other people’s money in this 
way, by borrowing money to invest, is a risky 
strategy: you still have to pay them back. See 
Chapter 22 for more on RRSPs.

 Chapter 4: Building Your Very Own Financial Plan
Investigating How Various Investments 
Have Performed
Always remember that when you’re saving and investing money, you have a 
fundamental choice. You can settle for low risk and low return by buying things 
like bonds or guaranteed deposits. The returns are thin, but the fluctuations in 
the value of your holdings tend to be small. Or you can gamble on high risk plus 
(you hope) high return. That involves buying stocks. They can make a lot more 
for investors, but the price swings are wild. There just ain’t no such animal as a 
low-risk, high-return investment. Sorry. But low-return investments carry their 
own special risk: the danger that you’ll see the value of your savings devoured 
by inflation, which is the long-term decline in the value of money. It all gets a bit 
confusing, but here are some examples to help you figure out your choices.
Have a look at Figures 4-1 through 4-4, which show the rate of return from 
four different sorts of investments over two decades. We picked four indices 
to get an idea of what your options are:
 
✓ Canadian stocks: The S&P/TSX composite stock index
 
✓ Canadian balanced: A blend of 60 percent Canadian stocks and 40 percent 
Canadian bonds (as represented by Morningstar’s balanced Canadian index)
 
✓ World stocks: The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MCSI) world index
 
✓ Global balanced: A blend of 60 percent global stocks (MSCI World Index) 
and 40 percent global bonds (Morningstar’s global balanced index)
Each case is expressed in Canadian dollars, and assumes an investment of 
$100 was made each month from mid-1988 to the end of June 2008.

Canadian stocks
Of the four strategies, the biggest return for Canadians came from staying at 
home and buying only Canadian stocks. Now, that’s a switch from what used 
to be the tedious out-performance of foreign stocks against our piddly little 
market on Bay Street. But rising prices for oil and other commodities — our 
traditional national strength — accompanied by a Canadian dollar that has 
skyrocketed to be worth more than its U.S. counterpart, have put the S&P/
TSX composite index on steroids.
When this book last went to press, in 2002, the TSX had lagged global 
stocks — as measured by the performance of the Morgan Stanley Capital 
International (MSCI) World Index, which tracks the performance of every 
major stock market on the planet — by more than two percentage points 
over a ten-year period. Six years later, it was a completely different story, 
with our market outpacing the global competition by an embarrassing six 
percentage points over ten years.
Anyway, Canadian stocks, as represented by the S&P/TSX composite index, 
were the top performer among the four portfolios, with a 10-percent com-
pound annual return over the 20 years ended June 2008. It outperformed in 
four out of the five calendar years ended 2007, as well as in a number of years 
during the 1990s. An investor who put $100 each month into this portfolio 
during that span would have ended up with more than $81,000 at the end of 
June 2008.

Canadian balanced index
Snapping at the heels of the TSX index fund was the Canadian balanced index, 
with a 9.7-percent, 20-year compound annual return as of June 2008. This port-
folio is a blend of stocks and bonds — the sort of thing just about every inves-
tor should own. (We’ve used Morningstar’s balanced fund indices to represent 
this and the global balanced investment.) The Canadian balanced index has a 

72
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
cautious, stay-at-home mix of 60 percent in the S&P/TSX composite and 40 per-
cent in the S&P/TSX Canadian Bond Market Index. The strong showing of this 
balanced investment demonstrates that Canadian bonds as well as stocks have 
done well over the years. If you had put $100 a month over ten years into this 
portfolio, you would have been nearly $72,500 richer.
Global balanced
There was a big gap in performance between the Canadian and global indi-
ces. The global balanced fund managed a 7.2-percent, 20-year compound 
annual return, producing $44,300 from $100 per month investments during 
that span. This index has 60 percent of its assets in the MSCI World stock 
index and the rest in the Citigroup World Bond Index.
World stocks
Owning the blue-chip stocks that make up the MSCI World Index from 
June 1988 to June 2008 produced a 7.2-percent compound annual return in 
Canadian-dollar terms. That would have produced a relatively unimpressive 
$44,200 nest egg for an investor who put in $100 each month. (It was a tad 
less than the global balanced fund because the 7.2 percent annualized return 
was rounded up to a single decimal point.)
Remembering the Importance 
of Diversification
Investing over two decades, as the portfolio examples in the previous section 
demonstrate, makes the stock market look like a pretty good place to be. Well, 
certainly the Canadian stock market, anyway. But you might also have noticed 
that the road to riches looks somewhat smoother with bonds added to the mix. 
Indeed, the graphs for the balanced portfolios resemble a gentler hike up the 
Quebec’s Laurentians, compared to the Rocky Mountain image presented by 
the stock-only portfolios. So despite the potentially better returns from stocks, 
your nerves will probably have an easier time of it with a balanced portfolio.
When Andrew wrote the first edition of this book in 2000 — when the stock 
market was only beginning to turn bad — the 20-year return on the MSCI World 
Index was a huge 17.1 percent, and a $100-a-month investor would have ended 
up with more than $168,000 over 20 years, or twice as much money. Stocks may 
be a great long-term investment, but it depends whose long term we’re talking 

73
 Chapter 4: Building Your Very Own Financial Plan
about — in other words, which period you use for measuring. The bottom line is 
you may get lucky with stocks if you cash out at the right time, when the market 
is surging. But who’s that lucky? (Not he, Andrew will tell you.)
 
The sensible course is to own lots of bonds (loans to companies and govern-
ments) as well as shares — that way your portfolio has a chance to produce 
the steady returns that retirement saving is all about. Remember, too, that 
prior to 2006–2007 a good chunk of the gains from foreign investments came 
from currency changes, mainly because the Canadian dollar slumped against 
the U.S. dollar in the late 1990s. That produced a bonus for Canadian inves-
tors: the value of overseas holdings grew steadily because they were denomi-
nated in foreign currencies. The opposite, of course, has been the case during 
the loonie’s recent surge.
So, for those building a mutual fund portfolio, here are some general observa-
tions drawn from the analysis of the four portfolios:
 
✓ Over the two decades, portfolios with lots of bonds performed nearly 
as well as 100-percent equity portfolios. Admittedly, that was against a 
backdrop of falling inflation and interest rates worldwide, always great 
for bond prices. But cautious investors who took the balanced approach 
kept up nicely with the ears-pinned-back, all-stocks-or-be-damned gam-
blers. So, own some bonds.
 
✓ The two balanced indices suffered much smaller price plunges than 
the stock-only barometers during most of the 20 years. For example, in 
2001 and 2002, the balanced Canadian index fell 4.2 percent each year, 
compared with tumbles of about 12.5 percent each year by the S&P/TSX. 
In 2007, bonds did little to protect the global investor, however, as the 
balanced global index fell 6.5 percent, only about half a percentage point 
better than the MSCI World Index.
 
✓ Canadian stocks have, for the most part over the long term, underper-
formed overseas shares, in part because Canada doesn’t have many of 
the giant global companies that made so many investors so rich in the 
1980s and 1990s. That means a portfolio that has most of its assets in 
Canada is exposed to a small market that may be less likely to produce 
big winners. Although Bay Street’s recent strength might make many 
of us question the necessity of foreign investing, remember that these 
gains have come largely on the back of strong oil and commodity prices, 
and, of course, have been bolstered significantly by the soaring loonie. 
Canada still represents only a fraction of the world’s stock market value. 
(On the other hand, at least some of your long-term savings should 
remain in Canada if you plan to retire in this country. That’s because in 
retirement you’ll need Canadian dollars to draw on. Plus, as we’ve all 
seen, when the loonie climbs a lot versus other currencies, it reduces 
the value of your foreign investments.)

74
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
Portfolios for Your Type of Investing
In this section we look at three suggested mutual fund portfolios that offer 
a good prospect of achieving the different goals of a short-term saver, a bal-
anced investor, and a growth investor. Are these the very best portfolios that 
could ever be designed? No, because the future can’t be predicted with com-
plete accuracy. Distrust any financial professional who says he or she can tell 
you what the markets will be up to, or down to, in the years to come. These 
portfolios represent a cautious guess as to what the global economy will do, 
and they amount to a forecast that the world isn’t likely to slide into either 
hyperinflation or bitter deflation (a prolonged fall in prices).
As you become more knowledgeable about and interested in investing, you 
may want to start adding to or altering these suggestions. But they’re a good 
place to start when you’re adding the power of mutual funds to your financial 
plan.
 
The portfolios include lots of so-called index funds — funds that simply track 
a stock or bond market average or index by essentially buying every stock in 
the market. For example, most Canadian equity index funds are designed to 
produce a return in line with the S&P/TSX index. Index funds offer huge advan-
tages to investors, such as low costs (less than 1 percent of your money each 
year, compared with well over 2 percent for traditional equity funds) and the 
reassurance that your fund won’t badly underperform the market. (If you opt 
for exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, instead of index mutual funds, you’ll save 
even more in annual expenses.) But as the new millennium neared, market 
indexes in most parts of the world were taken over by a few highly priced 
glamour stocks, many of them technology companies. In Canada it was Nortel; 
in the U.S. it was stocks like Cisco. That meant index investing itself had 
become something of a risky proposition. Stock index proprietors introduced 
capped versions of their indices to offset the effect of these dominant stocks, 
and some fund companies launched capped index funds based on these new 
barometers. Most of Barclays Canada’s iShares Canadian equity exchange-
traded funds track the corresponding S&P/TSX capped indices. However, 
most index funds remain true to the basic, uncapped indices. Thus, half the 
stock market money in our portfolios has been allocated to traditional-style, 
“actively managed” funds, which have managers who attempt to predict which 
stocks will go up and which will drop. For more on index funds and ETFs, see 
Chapter 15.
Note that international equity funds usually invest in stocks outside of North 
America, so the international index funds mentioned here don’t track the U.S. 
market. That’s why we’ve also included U.S. index funds. However, global 
equity funds buy stocks everywhere, including the United States. The actively 
managed funds in these portfolios are global, so you needn’t include separate 
U.S. equity funds.

75
 Chapter 4: Building Your Very Own Financial Plan
Some experts will look at these suggested portfolios and complain that we 
haven’t included any specialized funds that invest in small companies. In the 
past, shares in small companies have occasionally produced huge returns, 
and evidence suggests they sometimes do well when big-company stocks 
are languishing. Traditionally, that has happened in very hot stock markets, 
when investors are willing to buy risky little stocks in pursuit of big gains. In 
other words, buying shares in lesser-known companies provides something 
called diversification — the strategy of spreading an investor’s risk among 
different investments. But small-company shares also have a nasty habit of 
stagnating for years, and their returns tend to be highly volatile: big gains 
one year and then nothing for several years. So to keep things simple, we’ve 
left small-company funds out of these sample portfolios. You might miss out 
on a percentage point or two of returns every few years, but you’ll be avoid-
ing a lot of risk. As you get more comfortable with investing, you may decide 
to add some small-stock funds to your portfolio. Just make sure you buy at 
least two, because different types of small stocks tend to thrive at different 
times. It’s frustrating to find yourself stuck with a manager who bought just 
the wrong sort of small-company shares.
 
Part III contains chapters on each type of fund, explaining the advantages and 
drawbacks of each in detail.
A penny earned is a penny saved
The first portfolio, shown in Table 4-1, is ideal for savers. The savers’ port-
folio consists mostly of Canadian assets (no point speculating on currency 
changes if you’re just saving for a Volvo), so it can be held both within and 
outside an RRSP. It includes small quantities of regular bonds, even though 
their prices can be volatile, to increase its interest income. And the global 
bonds provide a small amount of protection against a possible drop in the 
value of the Canadian dollar because they’re bought and sold in foreign 
currencies.
You could make this portfolio even simpler by just putting half the money 
into a money market fund and the rest into a short-term bond fund. Money 
market funds are very unlikely ever to lose money for their unitholders (it 
would probably take a major financial dislocation before one did). Short-term 
bond funds are a little more dangerous, but they’re also slightly more lucra-
tive to own than money market funds. The median short-term bond fund 
produced an average annual return of 3.7 percent during the ten years ended 
June 2008, compared with an even 3 percent for the median Canadian money 
market fund.

Balancing act
The next portfolio, Table 4-2, for balanced investors, is truly one you can just 
buy and forget. Yes, it will go into a slump if inflation returns and interest 
rates surge. But that’s true of virtually any investment except for cash (usu-
ally held in the form of bonds and other debt instruments with less than a 
year to go before they mature).
With its large 30-percent proportion of cash and cash-like, short-term bonds, 
this portfolio is unlikely to lose more than 10 percent in a single year, unless a 
sharp uptick occurs in inflation, the economy slides into a recession, or some 
national or global mishap sends the bond market into a downward spiral.

One for the risk-takers
Then there’s the Ferrari of the stock market, for those who relish the cold 
taste of fear, the brutal snapping, and the terrible slashing. Check out Table 
4-3. You could easily make this portfolio more exciting and dangerous by 
reducing the bond weighting even more, or by buying emerging-markets 
funds and narrow regional funds that invest in Asia or Europe.
Arguably, every aggressive portfolio should contain a small weighting in 
developing countries (because of their huge growth prospects), but we’ve 
left out emerging-markets funds to keep the portfolio as simple as possible. 
In any case, at least one of your conservative global equity funds is certain to 
own a few companies in emerging nations. You could also step on the gas by 
going into volatile sector funds that track just one type of company, such as 
technology outfits or oil and gas producers. However, once again, your index 
funds and actively managed funds are almost certain to own these companies 
and industries anyway.
A portfolio like this is certain to do well as long as stock markets stay strong. 
It’s very broadly diversified, and its big index fund component means you’ll 
end up owning lots of huge, well-run companies.

o you’ve got your debt under control and your insurance taken care of. 
Time to start saving money. But what are you going to do with those 
vast piles of cash? Think of this chapter as an investment primer, a rundown 
on the drawbacks and attractions of the different types of financial assets you 
can buy with your savings. If you’re certain by now that funds are the way to 
go for you, then feel free to skip to Part II, where we explain where you can go 
to buy them. But it’s useful to know about the other investment choices you 
have — including Canada Savings Bonds and guaranteed investment certifi-
cates, which can’t be bought through mutual funds at all.
Don’t worry, though. The decisions you need to make are fairly simple when 
you come down to it. The investment business is an incredibly conservative 
industry. For all the dot-com flash and techno-trading systems, your basic 
investment options are the same as they were in the 1920s or even the 1820s — 
stocks, bonds, or cash. Here’s what’s out there: everything from the mundane 
to the manic. In this chapter, we take you for a stroll down Risk Road, moving 
from the very safest choices to the most unpredictable. Along the way, we 
point out some of the dangers and delights of each investment — so that even 
if you end up handing your money over to a fund company to manage, you’ll at 
least have an idea of what they’re going to do with it.

Canada Savings Bonds: 
Dull Yet Dependable
Every fall, Ottawa starts running ads in the newspapers and on television 
touting the wonders of lending money to the government by buying Canada 
Savings Bonds (CSBs) and their flashier-sounding cousins, Canada Premium 
Bonds. (CPBs). Some provinces sell their own versions. Actually, these things 
aren’t really bonds at all, because their market value never fluctuates in line 
with prevailing interest rates. That’s because they can be cashed in at virtu-
ally any time by simply selling them back to the government at the purchase 
price plus accumulated interest. With most normal bonds, you have to find a 
buyer to take them off your hands and no certainty exists as to the price you 
get. If interest rates have gone up, making other bonds more attractive, you’ll 
have to accept a lower price than the one you paid.
Five series of each type of bond are sold from November through March, with 
new interest rates announced for each series at the start of each sales month. 
They can be bought at nearly all banks, credit unions, stockbrokers, and trust 
companies. Or you can buy them from the government itself: Go to the Web 
site at www.csb.gc.ca or call 1-888-996-8899, Monday through Friday from 
8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Thousands of employers across Canada offer 
them to their staff by way of direct deductions from their pay.
The interest rates paid on the bonds are announced at the time of sale, but the 
government is free to increase the rate above those minimums if interest rates 
in the broad market have increased enough (if the rate is too low, the public has 
an annoying habit of cashing in all of their CSBs). Canada Premium Bonds pay 
slightly more interest but carry more limitations on when you can cash them in.
Canada Savings Bonds can be sold back to the government at any time 
(although you get no interest if you cash them in within the first 90 days), but 
Canada Premium Bonds are redeemable once a year, on the anniversary of 
the issue date or during the 30 days afterward. CSBs and CPBs currently have 
a term to maturity of ten years — that is, you have to take your money back 
after that time or roll it into another set of bonds.
Looking at the upside of CSBs and CPBs
Apart from the ability to get your investment back easily (a wonderful conve-
nience), CSBs and CPBs come with some major advantages for investors. They’re

81
 Chapter 5: Beyond Mutual Funds
 
✓ Easy to buy: You can make small investments of as little as $100, or $500 
when the bonds are bought under the “RSP option” for inclusion in a 
registered retirement savings plan. You can put the bonds in your own 
“self-directed RRSP” — an account you run yourself at a stockbroker or 
discount broker — or in a special RRSP for Canada Savings Bonds and 
Canada Premium Bonds. It’s called the Canada RSP.
 
✓ Available in two appealing types: These bonds can be purchased in 
regular interest form, with the annual interest payments going directly 
into your bank account. Or you can buy no-brainer compound interest 
bonds, where the income is added to your investment and thus starts 
generating interest of its own.
 
✓ Safe and secure: The money is safe as long as the federal government’s 
credit remains good. And you always know exactly how much your 
principal — the money you have tied up in an investment — is worth. 
That’s not the case with a stock, bond, or mutual fund, whose value may 
have slumped by the time you go to sell it.
 
The ability to get your cash back easily makes CSBs and CPBs like a sort of 
savings voucher, entitling the holder to a stream of interest payments and the 
return of his or her capital on demand. That flexibility is one of the great vir-
tues of Canada Savings Bonds, and it’s a good reason to consider buying them 
for your short-term savings needs — but the low interest rates on offer mean 
they’re unsuitable for the lion’s share of your savings. Meantime, the reassur-
ing government guarantee makes CSBs suitable for the “cash” or no-risk por-
tion of your investment portfolio.
Weighing the downside of CSBs and CPBs
CSBs and CPBs do have some major drawbacks, such as the following:
 
✓ Low returns: The price of security and convenience is a return that’s a 
lot lower than the potential payback from bonds or stocks. For example, 
the Canada Savings Bonds that went on sale from March 2 to April 1, 
2008, carry an interest rate of 2.45 percent. The rates paid on that date’s 
Canada Premium Bond issue are 2.75 percent for the first year, 2.90 per-
cent for the second, and 3.05 percent for the third year, for an annual 
compound rate of return of 2.90 percent over three years.
 
 As you can see from Figure 5-1, an investor who invested $10,000 in Canada 
Savings Bonds and left it there from mid-1988 to mid-2008 ended up with 
about $25,600, or a tad more than what he or she would have gained 
by buying one-year guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) at a bank 
($24,300). However, an investor who took on more risk and put his or her 
money into AGF Management Ltd.’s AGF Canadian Balanced Fund, a huge 
and fairly cautious balanced portfolio of stocks and high-quality bonds, 
would have finished with nearly twice as much money — about $48,000.

✓ Lack of long-term projections: Because the rates on CSBs and CPBs are 
periodically re-set to keep them in line with competing interest rates, 
you can’t know exactly what you’ll earn over the life of the bond beyond 
the announced years. By contrast, if you buy a GIC or ordinary bond and 
hold it until it matures, you know exactly what you’re getting.
 
CSBs and CPBs are really more of a savings vehicle than a true investment. 
Nothing’s wrong with that — but the price you pay for simplicity and peace of 
mind is a low return.
Go ahead and buy them if you want a safe investment that you can choose 
and then forget about. CSBs are great for people who want simplicity and 
security. The government takes care of the recordkeeping, and the return 
you get is usually slightly better than that of a bank account. But the interest 
rate on CSBs and CPBs is so low that with a little homework it’s easy to find 
investments that will make your money work harder.

The Good Old GIC: You 
Know Where You Sleep
You’ve no doubt noticed that most banks offer miserable rates of interest — 
1 percent if you’re lucky — on money dumped in a “savings” account. You 
may be able to get more if you keep a very high balance in the account, or if 
you opt for an account with a higher rate but exorbitant transaction fees. And 
some “e-savings” accounts pay a decent rate with low fees if you abide by 
certain transaction rules. But without getting bogged down in bank-account 
research, you can do better if you put the cash in a guaranteed investment 
certificate (GIC) with a bank, insurance company, or trust company for a 
fixed period.
A GIC is a deposit that a financial institution accepts on the understanding 
that the money, plus a guaranteed amount of interest, will be returned after 
a set number of years. The interest is calculated on an annual basis and each 
year’s interest is usually added or “compounded” onto the total for the pur-
pose of calculating the next year’s interest — so you earn interest on interest. 
Using the above 20-year investment example, $10,000 invested in June 1988 
in five-year GICs (with interest compounded annually) would have grown to 
$30,300 in mid-2008 — considerably more than with a CSB or one-year GICs. A 
drawback is that you may not be able to get the deposit back before the term 
is up, or, if you can, you might have to forfeit the interest earned. In other 
words, these deposits aren’t as liquid — cashable — as you might think. That 
means GICs are less flexible than Canada Savings Bonds. The great beauty of 
GICs, though, is that you know exactly where you stand: For example, a five-
year deposit of $10,000 at a rate of 3 percent compounded annually will give 
you $11,592.74 after 60 months — no more and no less.
 
For years, generations even, the GIC was Canada’s favourite investment, and 
it’s still the number-one choice of many Europeans. And why not? As recently 
as 1990, when interest rates were high and prices for food and shelter were 
rising fast, you could leave money on deposit at a big, safe bank and come 
back a year later to collect a lump sum that had magically grown by 12 per-
cent. Well, it wasn’t magic, actually. Banks had to offer those kinds of rates to 
attract any money because inflation was rising. But as you can see from Figure 
5-2, a steady drop in the rate of inflation during the 1990s meant a remorseless 
decline in GIC rates. And after rates slumped below the 7- to 8-percent mark 
in the early part of the decade, the stage was set for a flood of hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars into mutual funds as Canadians demanded a decent return on 
their money.

The recession of the early 1980s and fears of a recurrence around 1990 kept 
interest rates high until 1992, when the economy strengthened and rates 
began their plummet to historic lows before rising ever so slightly the past 
few years. So, no bonanza.
Types of GICs
GICs come in a sometimes-bewildering range of shapes and flavours, so always 
make sure you understand all of the mechanics before you buy one. Get an 
employee of the financial institution to write down the value of the deposit when 
it matures (except in the case of index-linked GICs, whose returns are tied to the 
stock market).
Here are some common variations above and beyond the traditional non-cash-
able GIC (even more specific types exist):
 
✓ Cashable GICs: Traditional GICs tie your money up or at least reduce the 
interest you get if you cash out early. But cashable GICs let you take all or 
part of your money out early with no penalty. Expect to get a lower annual 
rate, though. It can be a full percentage point lower than the return on a 
normal non-cashable GIC.

85
 Chapter 5: Beyond Mutual Funds
 
✓ Index-linked GICs: These pay you little or no fixed interest but they 
promise to return your initial investment and pay a return that’s linked 
to the performance of a stock market index — always a bit watered-
down, though, in order to pay for the guaranteed return of capital 
and leave a profit margin for the bank. In other words, your money is 
safe from loss but your potential return isn’t as good as it would have 
been investing directly in stocks. For example, a typical GIC linked to 
the Canadian stock market might pay no guaranteed interest but give 
the investor a return identical to the change in the Standard & Poor’s/
Toronto Stock Exchange 60 index — subject to some limitations.
 
 Index GICs are popular when interest rates on ordinary GICs are low. 
The problem with these products is that their rules and terms are so 
complicated it can be difficult or impossible to know how well you’re 
doing as you go along. Yes, they offer some stock market action for 
investors who would otherwise be too nervous to go into equities, but 
most investors will do better with an index fund and a couple of con-
servative equity funds, especially if they can ride out downturns in the 
market over a few years.
 
 At least one bank, CIBC, has a GIC linked to a diversified “portfolio” of 
market indices. Its Market Mix GIC attaches the return to performance 
of the S&P/TSX 60 index (20 percent); S&P 500 composite index (40 
percent); FTSE (Financial Times) Eurotop 100 index (17 percent); and 
Japan’s Nikkei 225 index (13 percent) — as well as 5 percent Merrill 
Lynch Canada Broad Market (bond) index. An additional 5 percent of the 
product’s return is based on a three- or five-year CIBC GIC rate.
 
 Some institutions have rolled out GICs linked to the performance 
of a specific mutual fund. Royal Bank has one linked to its RBC 
O’Shaughnessy International Equity Fund. Bank of Montreal links one of 
its “Progressive GICs” to returns of its BMO Dividend Fund.
 
✓ Convertible GICs: RRSP marketing season is the first 60 days of the 
calendar year, when money put into your RRSP can be used to reduce 
taxable income for the previous year. For example, if you earned $50,000 
during 2007 but managed to put $5,000 into a plan by March 1, 2008, then 
you’d have to pay tax on income of only $45,000 for 2007. During that 
two-month period, institutions offer flexible GICs that let you invest your 
money at the one-year rate, but then allow you to switch to a longer-term 
deposit or to the company’s mutual funds.
 
✓ Escalating-rate GICs: These GICs also don’t lock you in. You can cash out 
without penalty after one or two years, but if you stay on, the interest rate 
gets higher. The design of these GICs varies among institutions, and some, 
like TD Canada Trust, offer more than one type. For example, a TD Triple 
Value GIC taken out in mid-2008 paid 3.1 percent during the first year, 4.3 
percent in year two, and 5.5 percent in year three, for an effective annual 
yield of about 4.3 percent. A three-year cashable GIC at TD, by compari-
son, paid 2.3 percent. Like index-linked GICs, the returns offered by some 
of these “escalator” GICs are based on some pretty complex formulas.

Finding the best rates
 
A quick way to find out the various GIC rates on offer from a wide variety 
of institutions is to check Web sites like Canoe Money (money.canoe.ca), 
which is run by Quebecor Inc., publisher of the Sun daily newspapers. If you 
prefer to pore over printed tables, most major daily newspapers publish con-
sumer interest rate tables in their weekend or Monday editions. Both online 
and print tables list rates at a range of lenders and deposit takers, from the 
biggest bank to the most obscure trust company. (You’ll also be able to check 
rates for mortgages and bank accounts while you’re at it.)
You often can get a higher rate by going to a smaller company, but dealing 
with the little outfit may be more troublesome because it won’t have the 
same branch network and resources. (Wherever you go, make sure the insti-
tution is a member of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corp. See below for more 
on the deposit insurance protection provided by this government agency.)
Checking out the benefits of GICs
Don’t spurn the humble GIC out of hand. They never lose money. Remember 
bad-news years for the stock market, such as 2001 and 2002, when the median 
Canadian equity fund lost 8 percent and 14 percent, respectively? Sticking to 
one-year GICs would have kept you in the black those years, gaining an average 
2.7 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively. GICs offer other advantages:
 
✓ Simplicity: They’re simple and quick to buy, with no extra fees or com-
plicated forms to fill out. Just about any bank, insurance company, or 
stockbroker will sell you one.
 
✓ Income generating: They’re a useful planning tool if you need your port-
folio to throw off a regular stream of income. That can be done by “ladder-
ing” GICs — putting the money into deposits with separate terms, each 
maturing on a different date to match your spending needs. Even if you 
don’t need the money for income, having your GICs come due at different 
times is also handy for reducing “reinvestment risk.” That’s the problem 
of getting a pile of money to reinvest from a maturing bond or deposit just 
as interest rates are low. If the money comes up for re-investment at dif-
ferent times, you can re-invest it at a variety of interest rates.
 
✓ Safe and secure: If you buy a GIC from a bank, trust company, or loan 
company, as long as the GIC’s term to maturity doesn’t exceed five years, 
your money is protected by insurance provided by the federal govern-
ment’s Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation. If the financial institution 
fails, CDIC will cover an individual for up to $100,000 in deposits (including 
chequing accounts and the like but not mutual funds) at that institution. 

87
 Chapter 5: Beyond Mutual Funds
When buying a GIC, always make sure the company you’re dealing with 
has CDIC coverage. Go to the Web site at www.cdic.ca for more informa-
tion, including the “Quiz on Deposit Insurance” — at last, a fun activity for 
guests at one of your interminable soirees.
Watching out for inflation
 
Before you abandon all thoughts of buying mutual funds and plunge into GICs 
instead, remember that fixed-rate deposits are a dangerous investment in 
one important sense. Their rates of return can be so low that they do little 
to protect you against inflation. As Table 5-1 shows, even quite modest rates 
of inflation eat away alarmingly quickly at the real value of your savings. The 
U.S. dollar, still the world’s main store of wealth, lost its value at an average 
of about 5 percent during the 1980s and 1990s — in other words, prices in the 
United States rose by about 5 percent per year. The inflation rate has been 
much lower in recent years, dipping to less than 2 percent in Canada, before 
inching back up thanks to rising commodity prices. Inflation of just 3 percent a 
year wipes out about one-fifth of the value of your money in five years.
The curse of inflation means that, as an investor, you’re constantly clamber-
ing up a slippery, moving staircase covered in rotting mackerel and parts of 
Scotsmen. Stand still or go forward too slowly, and you end up sliding backward.

Bonds and Strip Bonds
Bonds are loans to governments or corporations that have been packaged 
into certificates that trade on the open market. They usually pay a fixed rate 
of interest, often twice a year. And they “mature” or come due after a set 
number of years, when the holder of the bond gets back the value of the orig-
inal loan, known as the “principal.” But don’t bother buying individual bonds 
until you’ve got $10,000 or so to spend, because the cost of buying a cheap 
bond index mutual fund is so low. Index funds, which just earn a return in 
line with an entire bond market or index, are particularly suitable for the 
bond market because normal human managers find it very difficult to earn 
much more than their rivals without taking risks.
The median Canadian fixed income fund has annual expenses of about 1.8 
percent, but many bond funds can be held for less than 1 percent a year. 
That’s less than $100 out of a $10,000 investment, so you’re doing fine.
Considering bond alternatives
 
If you’re comfortable buying and selling on the stock exchange, it’s worth 
thinking about buying a bond exchange-traded fund — bond ETFs are units 
in a simple trust that give you ownership of bonds but trade on the exchange 
like a share. We talk lots more on exchange-traded funds — which are perhaps 
the best deal of all for small investors — in Chapter 15. The big advantage to 
buying bonds or a bond ETF is that you save on fees. The biggest domestic 
bond ETF, iShares Canadian DEX Universe Bond Fund, charges just 0.3 percent.
You can also consider bond funds. The annual fund expenses will cut into 
your yield, yes — but you may just decide the cost is worth it. In Chapter 
14, we single out some bond funds that have relatively low expenses — and 
whose mannagers have done a good job investing, too, by the way!
 
Don’t forget, though, that with a bond fund you are essentially playing the 
bond market without the backup security of being able to hold a bond to its 
maturity date, and thus recover your original investment, or principal, in 
addition to the periodic interest payments. Bond fund managers buy and sell 
bonds on the market, and thus you are signing on to a pretty aggressive form 
of investing. No, you won’t exactly be a “master of the universe,” as in Tom 
Wolfe’s The Bonfire of the Vanities, but you will be participating in a fairly 
active market.

89
 Chapter 5: Beyond Mutual Funds
Investing directly in bonds
You can obtain a far better yield than bond funds by investing directly in 
bonds. However, the bond market is not always the friendliest place for small 
investors — it can be difficult to get information or do trades. It’s just not a 
popular product, and profit margins for the dealer are thin.
Finding bond prices and yield quotes on the Internet is not as easy as look-
ing up stock prices. One source of this information is globeinvestorgold.
com, The Globe and Mail’s premium Web site for investors, which charges a 
subscription fee.
 
The trouble with bonds is that, unlike stocks, they don’t trade in a central mar-
ketplace where the prices are posted. If you buy stocks, your broker usually 
just acts as an “agent” who connects you with the seller’s broker, collecting a 
commission for the service. But your broker generally buys and sells bonds 
as a “principal” — that is, the firm actually owns the bonds it trades, holding 
them in “inventory” like a store. That means when you’re trading bonds, you 
generally have to ask your broker what the firm’s price quote is for a bond you 
want to buy or sell. And then you more or less have to accept the price that’s 
offered.
Even bigger problems can occur in buying and selling strip bonds, which are 
bonds that have been modified by brokers to reflect the fact that many long-
term buyers who hold bonds until maturity aren’t interested in collecting peri-
odic interest payments. In fact, such dribs and drabs of interest are a liability 
because they must constantly be reinvested. So strip bonds pay no interest 
until they mature — the interest payments have been “stripped” away. Instead, 
they’re bought at a deep discount to their face value, maturing at full value or 
“par” like a normal bond. For example, you might pay your broker 50 cents on 
the dollar for a strip bond maturing in ten years. That will give you an annual 
compound yield of about 7.2 percent. In other words, an investment of $5,000 
becomes $10,000 after a decade. Because strip bondholders are prepared to 
wait until they get any of their money back, they’re rewarded with a higher 
yield to maturity. It’s often 0.5 to 1 percentage point of extra yield yearly com-
pared with a regular bond with a similar term to maturity.
 
Strip bonds can be difficult to unload. They’re volatile, losing their market 
value quickly when interest rates rise. That’s because higher rates offer better 
interest-earning opportunities in the here and now, so they rapidly devalue 
money you don’t get for a long time. And strip bonds are all about waiting for 
a faraway payoff. Because strip bonds are often sold as a retail product, your 
broker may be reluctant to buy one back from you at a decent price if the firm 
has no demand for strips from other clients. So if you’re buying a strip, plan 
on holding it to maturity.

90
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
You can put through a regular bond order at discount broker TD Waterhouse 
for as little as $5,000, but the yield you get won’t be as good as the one you 
see listed in the newspapers. Table 5-2 shows a typical listing for a govern-
ment bond and for a big blue-chip corporation in mid-2008. These are approx-
imate rates for large trades of bonds, and you could expect to pay a higher 
price, and get a smaller yield, with a small order. Notice how in each case 
the bond was producing an annual yield lower than its annual stated interest 
rate, or coupon. That’s because, with interest rates so low, investors hungry 
for income were trading the bonds at a premium to their face value. When 
the bonds mature, at their face value, the buyers who paid a premium will 
take a small loss on the extra they paid. Notice also how the Bank of Montreal 
bond offers a higher yield than the federal government issue: Corporate 
bonds yield more than government bonds because they’re slightly more risky 
(the government can print its own money, after all). But it’s harder to trade 
corporate bonds because the market is smaller, and if you want to get out of 
a bond you could find it hard to sell the thing at a decent price.

So if you have at least $10,000 to play with, buy bonds and hold them to 
maturity by all means. You know exactly what yield you’re getting and how 
much money you’ll have when the bonds mature. With a bond mutual fund, 
which is constantly rolling over its holdings, you won’t have nearly that 
much certainty.
If you plan to try trading bonds, remember that making money in this market 
(“going forward,” an annoying expression Bay Street types like to use a dozen 
times before breakfast) will be tougher in the long run. That’s because bond 
prices usually only go up when interest rates and the rate of inflation fall — if 
inflation stays unchanged, then all you’re likely to get from a bond is its yield 
to maturity at the time of purchase.

Stocks: Thrills, Spills, and 
Twisted Wreckage
The stock market is insane. Although you can spot stocks trading at crazy 
prices and make money buying those individual shares, it’s hard — so hard 
as to be damned near impossible.
Going with index funds
Unless you plan to spend quite a bit of time tracking stocks and reading the 
financial press, you’re probably best off in equity funds. The easiest strategy 
of all: Just climb aboard the madness by putting a chunk of your money into 
stock index funds — which track the whole stock market — and you’ll be 
doing what a lot of smart pros do. The indexes themselves go crazy from time 
to time, as they did in 2005 and 2006 when investors rushed to buy income 
trusts and then rushed even more quickly to sell them off when the govern-
ment removed income trusts’ tax advantages in late 2006. More recently, 
skyrocketing crude-oil prices sent the S&P/TSX composite index on a wild 
ride, while U.S. and other markets slumped. Perhaps the most spectacular 
example of abrupt stock market activity was in 1999 and 2000, when technol-
ogy and telecommunications stocks dominated the market benchmarks. It 
might all seem too much to stomach, but when you look at the long-term 
record of stock market performance, particularly in North America, it’s hard 
to stay away from the index-investing party. You’re only alive three times, 
after all, and the last two times you come back as something in the sea, so 
why not have fun now?
As Figure 5-3 shows, an investment of $10,000 in Canadian dollars in stocks 
outside Canada and the United States grew at a compound annual rate of 5.7 
percent to about $30,400 between mid-1988 and mid-2008. The same $10,000 
put into U.S. stocks grew to about $62,000 — a 9.5-percent, 25-year compound 
annual return — while Canadian stocks left you with more than $67,100, or a

Buying individual stocks
Think you can beat the market? Go ahead and dive into the shark . . . er, 
whatever . . . water where loads of sharks are swimming around. Picking 
good stocks consistently is really, really hard. You also need a broker to 
put through your trades. Your shares get held in the brokerage’s computer 
system under an account in your name. Always check your statement and 
transaction confirmation slips carefully, because mistakes happen.
If you want to buy individual stocks, you will need a bit of money to make 
it worth the trouble and expense — say, at least $10,000 — unless you’re 
just throwing a few thousand at the market for laughs (and it is enjoyable, 
so try it when you get a chance). Most trades go through in “board lots” of 
100 shares at a time, for efficiency. If you’re dealing in blue-chip companies, 
buying 100 shares can add up — it costs $2,500 for 100 shares trading at $25 
each. Buying fewer than 100 shares at a time is generally inefficient because it 
means dealing in an “odd” or “broken” lot of less than 100. If you deal in odd 
lots, you’ll often get a lower price when you sell and have to pay more per 
share when you buy.
And, as usual in investing, you must make a choice between having a sales-
person take care of all the humdrum stuff at a cost, or doing it yourself at less 
expense. The price of buying stock through a full-service traditional stock-
broker is usually shrouded in black curtains and dry ice. Establishing com-
mission rates can be like bargaining in a grim, sweaty bazaar on the edge of a 
poisoned desert — in other words, full-service brokerage commissions 

93
 Chapter 5: Beyond Mutual Funds
are completely negotiable. A small trade typically might cost 4 percent of a 
transaction’s value. That’s quite a haircut to take when you buy and again 
when you sell, but most frequent traders could haggle for much less. But 
don’t expect a full-service broker to be too thrilled about your business 
unless you’ve got at least $50,000 or even $100,000 to throw into the market, 
because with any less than that you’re more of an annoyance than a revenue 
stream. And it’s not unusual for an experienced and acclaimed broker to 
accept only “high-net-worth accounts” of $1 million or more.
So investors with modest means are left with a discount broker, which may 
impose no minimum account size at all but also provides little or no advice or 
help. Their commission rates vary, but discounters’ minimum commissions typi-
cally run from $5 to $20, depending on whether you use the Internet or a live 
human to do your trade. We talk plenty more on discount brokers in Chapter 6.
 
Buying and selling stocks profitably and reliably is difficult — perhaps 
impossible — but evidence indicates that ordinary investors can do well 
by investing in a few well-run, growing companies and simply holding them 
for years. Mind you, that’s emotionally tough to do. Take Bombardier Inc., a 
Montreal company that sells planes, trains, and other transportation equip-
ment all over the world. If you’d bought Bombardier shares in the summer of 
2003, you’d have roughly doubled your money in five years. But it would have 
been a tough buy-and-hold experience, with the share price moving from 
about $4.50 a share at the end of June 2003 to above $7 in the winter of 2004, 
thanks to strong sales, then tumbling to below $2 at the end of 2004, at which 
point the company’s retired chief executive, Laurent Beaudoin, returned to 
the executive suite. Investors clearly embraced this move, and the shares 
soared to the $7 neighbourhood by mid-2007. Industry challenges caused the 
stock to fall back to nearly $4 by the winter of 2008 before rallying big-time to 
around $9 by mid-2008, largely on the back of strong business-jet sales. Have 
a look at Figure 5-4 to see the rises and falls of Bombardier stock. The area 
graph along the bottom of the chart shows monthly trading volume, which 
indicates how much attention a stock is attracting in the market. High vol-
umes often accompany a significant rise or fall in price.

Taking a wilder ride with 
stock alternatives
For those who find even stocks too staid, options, warrants, futures, and rights 
are the wonder drug of investing — volatile ways to play or speculate on a 
share, market, or commodity. They’re structured to offer faster price changes 
than the underlying asset itself. The general principle is that for a little money 
you get to “buy risk” from someone who doesn’t want it. But the downside 
is that your wild party has a time limit, because the speculative instrument 
always expires after a set period. That’s a huge drawback: Many a market 
veteran will testify that picking the right investment is tough enough, without 
having the clock ticking against you. Buy these things only with money you 
don’t care about. For more about the stock market, see Chapter 10.
Income Trusts — No Longer 
the Taxpayer’s Best Friend
Income trusts are businesses that have been turned into a sort of fund that 
pays out regular — usually monthly — distributions to holders of their units. 
Say an income trust’s yield, or yearly payout to investors per dollar invested, 
is 8 percent. On a $10,000 investment, you could expect $800 in income pay-
ments, or one-tenth annually, versus the less than $300 you could expect in 
mid-2008 on a government bond.
Income trusts trade on the stock exchange like an ordinary share, so they’re 
simple to buy and sell. Look for them under “trust units” in daily newspapers’ 
stock market listings, and on stock-quote Web sites.
Remembering income-trust mania
Canadians initially took to the income trusts with wild enthusiasm. Financiers 
took regular publicly traded companies and essentially turned them inside 
out. As an income trust, the cash generated by the business is paid directly 
to investors in the form of a frequent cheque. That replaced the regular cor-
porate system, in which businesses generate a profit that is then taxed before 
they can pay out a dividend to their owners.
In addition to the generous tax treatment, investors welcomed the prospect 
of a healthy alternative to low-interest fixed income investments. In an era 
of rates below 2 percent, any investment that produced regular income was 
welcome.

95
 Chapter 5: Beyond Mutual Funds
Oil and real estate companies were the first to use this type of financing 
vehicle, and by 2006 almost half of the long and growing list of income trusts 
were oil and gas, electricity, and pipelines companies. But as the boom 
approached new heights, income trusts began to pop up in unexpected 
places. One fund paid out cash flow from an international sardine producer, 
two frozen-food warehouse funds, a pet food fund, and another fund that paid 
income from a burger chain.
Income trusts’ popularity as a substitute for common shares had become so 
great that by mid-2006 it was common to see a horde of income trusts men-
tioned in daily stock market summaries in the news media.
Clamping down on income trusts
However, the wheels fell off the income trust bandwagon in late 2006, when 
the federal government pulled the plug on the favourable tax treatment this 
type of investment had enjoyed. As trusts, they had provided a consider-
able tax-deferral on income paid out. But income trusts were in danger of 
replacing traditional stocks as the main product traded on the Toronto Stock 
Exchange (we could just see it: the Toronto Income Trust Exchange), and 
Ottawa acted suddenly to level the fiscal playing field. Income trust income is 
now taxed in the same way as dividend income.
While most existing income trusts survived the loss of their tax advantages, 
based on their investment fundamentals, the parade of stock-issuing compa-
nies heading to the trust conversion machine has slowed to a small line of 
stragglers.
Considering investing in income trusts
 
Most income trusts generally kept their distributions flowing as promised (oil 
and gas trusts have had to cut theirs when commodity prices fell, but that 
was obvious to investors all along). Yields have remained quite generous, at 
anywhere from 6 to 13 percent. Those are pretty generous income streams, 
but income trusts are riskier than a bond — particularly now that they’re no 
longer the taxpayer’s best friend. The bottom line? Evaluate an investment 
in an income trust in exactly the same way as you would a stock. Just as no 
certainty exists that a company’s share price will go up or it will be able to 
continually pay dividends, no guarantee exists that an income trust’s underly-
ing business will indeed be able to keep up the profits or revenue needed for 
the distributions. The trusts’ structures tend to be horrendously tangled, with 
corporate diagrams that would make your hair stand on end — complexity is 
always a red flag in investing. And the danger exists that the necessity to pay 
out cash will in fact bleed some of the businesses dry.

96
Part I: Meet the Mutual Fund 
But the small investor who buys a trust has one thing on his or her side: 
Mutual funds are also investing in trusts. Anxious to get in on the act, mutual 
fund companies have started funds that buy the trusts. We’re a little skepti-
cal here: When you combine the trusts’ management fees with the fees on 
the new funds (the median Canadian income trust equity mutual fund has an 
annual management expense ratio of 2.5 percent), you end up paying a lot of 
money to a lot of people. But at least professional investors are keeping an 
eye on the folks running the trusts.
The bottom line here is that income trusts are too new and potentially vola-
tile to go overboard on, but the generous yield means they’re a reasonable 
bet for many investors. As with any investment area, make sure you buy 
more than one to spread your risk. Better yet, you can invest in an income 
trust fund — we look at those in Chapter 18.
Managed Products: A Fee Circus
Every year, the investment industry comes up with warehouses full of glitter-
ing, new, nougat-flavoured, candy-coloured, “managed” investment products, 
each holding out the prospect of riches and implying your savings will be 
exposed to only the barest smidgeon of risk. And pretty well every year, a lot of 
these exciting innovations fail to deliver the golden eggs. The problem is that 
when investments are done up in such fancy packages, somebody has to pay 
for all the frills and gorgeous ribbons — and it’s always the retail buyer. The 
investment may be called a unit trust, a structured or hybrid fund, a royalty trust, a 
closed-end fund, a partnership, or an income trust — whatever the name and no 
matter how wonderful the sales spiel, never forget that if someone’s trying to 
sell the thing to you, they are collecting a fee somewhere down the line.
A number of complex investment vehicles are best left to sophisticated, expe-
rienced investors. Although they can be difficult to understand, it should be 
noted that some are, however, well managed, underpriced, and lucrative to 
own. But all carry disadvantages:
 
✓ Limited partnerships: These things are so complicated you need to 
have a lawyer look them over for you, and even then you’re vulnerable. 
They usually produce tax breaks for the buyers by investing in risky 
things such as movies or natural resources, but unless you have money 
to burn, don’t consider these highly speculative investments.
 
✓ Hedge funds: These began as privately run funds for the very rich, but 
are now sold to the small investor, often through hedge “funds of funds.” 
Hedging is the practice of protecting your investments against loss — by 
selling borrowed shares at the same time as you buy others, for exam-
ple. And that’s what the rich are mostly interested in when it comes 
to investing: protecting what they have. Hedge funds are no longer all 
about avoiding losses, though. Some, although not all, use exotic or 

97
 Chapter 5: Beyond Mutual Funds
risky techniques to chase high returns. Hedge funds used to require a 
minimum investment of $25,000, but they now can be had for as little as 
$1,000. But absolutely make sure you get professional advice before put-
ting any serious money into this type of product.
 
✓ “Structured” or “hybrid” funds: These things don’t represent Bay 
Street’s finest hour. Investors plowed hundreds of millions of dollars 
into the funds in 2001, attracted by their promise of a high yield plus 
the guaranteed return of capital after ten years. The typical fund sold 
units at $25 each with the pledge to refund that purchase price at the 
end of a decade — while also trying to pay a rich yield in the range of 8 
to 10 percent annually. The funds planned to pull off the neat trick with 
financial engineering — it involved a risk-free strategy of selling options 
to other investors that gave them the right to buy the fund’s stock hold-
ings. Didn’t work. The market for options turned tail, which forced many 
of the funds to reduce their hoped-for distributions to unitholders. The 
promise to repay investors’ purchase price still looks safe because it’s 
generally bankrolled by a major bank. But investors expecting a stream 
of fat cheques have been disappointed.
 
In your investing career, stick to the things the professionals buy — bonds and 
stocks and simple mutual funds that invest in bonds and stocks. Buying a fancy, 
managed product adds a level of cost and complexity that can only reduce your 
returns. Buying a stock or a royalty or income trust at the issue price when it’s 
first sold to the public is risky, too, even though you traditionally get it commis-
sion-free. Grab it later when the price has fallen, which it likely will eventually. 
The issue price has often been inflated to pay for brokerage commissions and 
other marketing expenses, not to mention general hype — so let some other 
poor investor pay for all those shiny new Mercedes and BMW automobiles you 
see parked in Bay Street garages.

iscount brokers are about the closest you can get, as yet, to investing 
heaven — they’re cheap and simple. A discount brokerage account is a 
great place to build wealth for the long term because you can put almost any 
kind of investment into it — including mutual funds, shares, bonds, Canada 
Savings Bonds, or even your own mortgage. Next to the invention of the 
mutual fund itself, discount brokers have done more than any other finan-
cial innovation to open up the stock and bond markets to ordinary people. 
Best of all, discount brokers are great for keeping costs down, which is one 
of the most important determinants of investment success. Discounters are 
firms set up simply to carry out your buy-and-sell orders — charging low 
commission rates — and provide an account in which you can hold your 
investments. They sometimes purport to offer lots of flashy services and 
information, some of which can actually be useful. But, essentially, a dis-
counter is just a bare-bones, order-taking service.
Picking a discount broker can be tricky. In this chapter, we give you the 
whole story — how discounters work, how they can save you more of your 
hard-won cash, how to pick the right one for you, and, finally, a few warnings 
about problems some discount brokerage customers have run into.

102
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
What Are Discount Brokers?
A discount broker is a true broker in the sense that it’s a firm set up simply to 
act as an agent. It collects a commission — that is, a transaction fee — when 
you buy or sell stocks, bonds, funds, and other investments. Yes, financial 
planners, insurance agents, and traditional stockbrokers also take your 
orders in this way, but they also bill themselves as advisers and experts who 
get a fee for helping out. Nothing wrong with that as such — but their fees 
eat into your returns. A Canadian discount brokerage firm is nearly always an 
arm of a big bank, taking most orders over the Internet or over the telephone. 
In the United States, discounters execute your share-buying transactions for 
as little as US$10. In Canada, minimum charges for a single trade are gener-
ally $20 and up for smaller accounts and $10 for larger ones, although you 
can trade for as little as $5 through at least one independent online broker.
 
If you’re absolutely certain you’re going to want personal advice from some-
one when you pick your funds, then skip this chapter and jump to Chapter 7, 
where we talk in detail about banks and the services they provide. Discount 
brokers don’t provide much advice, so if you feel you need help picking funds, 
you won’t enjoy using one.
A discounter is like a toothless dealer at a seedy Romanian horse market — an 
evasive, mildewed character with bushy eyebrows, smelling faintly of cheap 
plum brandy. You wouldn’t expect him to hold your hand (you wouldn’t really 
want to touch him, in fact — just sell you a horse and go away!). In the same 
way, a discount broker offers little or no advice or financial planning. Just a 
bare-bones account to hold your investments, and rock-bottom fees to buy and 
sell. Discounters may offer to sell you fancy packages of pre-selected funds, but 
won’t provide much personal advice about your situation.
 
Discounters, then, essentially offer a commodity. They employ a bunch of 
youngsters who are paid a wage for covering the phone and who don’t tradi-
tionally get extra pay for persuading customers to buy things. In return for 
charging low commissions, discounters hope to attract enough business to 
turn a profit. That’s why they’re so keen to turn as much of their business as 
possible over to the Internet, where it can be automated.
In the past, discounters were subject to the provincial securities rule that 
obliges brokers to ensure trades are suitable for the client. Like other people 
in the investment business who accept your money, they were supposed 
to follow the Know Your Client rule. (See Chapter 3 for more.) However, in 
recent years, securities regulators in Canada have relaxed the requirement 
that trades through a discount broker be vetted to see if they fit with the cus-
tomer’s risk tolerance and investment knowledge. That was after lobbying by 
the discounters, who claimed that having a human being check every trade 
slowed up the process too much. The message, for those who may have 
missed it, is this: When investing through a discounter, you’re on your own.

103
 Chapter 6: Discount Brokers: Cheap Thrills
Looking into Canadian discounters
This is an industry where you have to be large to make money. That’s why 
the big banks dominate the discount brokerage sector in Canada, because 
they already have vast customer bases. Each of the big banks has a discount 
brokerage arm, giving the banks a lock on the business, but they do have at 
least one formidable competitor — E*TRADE Canada, the Canadian unit of 
giant U.S. discount broker E*TRADE Group. Toronto-Dominion Bank’s dis-
count broker, TD Waterhouse, dominates the market. This means that other 
banks don’t earn huge profits from their discount brokerage arms, but banks 
usually feel obliged to push into every business they can.
Considering the savings
How much cheaper are the discounters? Well, their commissions for trading 
stocks are usually a small fraction of the fees levied by traditional stockbro-
kers, or even less, for trades of all sizes. And, unlike full-service brokerages, 
discounters publish their rates openly. For example:
 
 At a bank-owned, full-service brokerage, trading 100 shares priced at $25 
each could cost as much as $150, the minimum fee, but in many cases 
this would be discounted to $100 or less.
 
 The same trade at that bank’s discount brokerage arm would cost less 
than $30 if the trade were placed online, and approximately $60 if placed 
over the phone with one of the discounter’s agents.
In both cases, more active traders and individual large transactions would be 
eligible for much lower commissions.
Getting set up with a discounter
Setting up an account with a discount broker is simplicity itself. You don’t have 
to sit through a sales spiel or show that you have thousands to invest — just 
go online or telephone them, complete a few forms, open an account, and put 
in some money. Here’s more about how to get set up:
 
 Visit the Web site of the discount broker you picked and print out an 
account application form or an RRSP application form. (Chapter 3 has 
more details on account paperwork. Or go to the TD Waterhouse site at 
www.tdwaterhouse.ca for an example.)
 
 Notice the dense pages of conditions they make you sign. Guess what? 
They’re not in your favour. But just about all discount brokers impose 
these convoluted terms — which essentially say that in the event of a 
disagreement the broker is always right — so you can’t really escape.

104
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
 
 A discounter will pretty well accept your business no matter how poor 
you are. But you’ll have to have the necessary cash in your account, 
Jack, before you make the first trade. For a fund, the minimum buy is 
nearly always $1,000.
 
 You never have to meet anyone face to face. The anonymity is relaxing, 
although you’ll almost certainly get put on hold for a good stretch when 
problems occur in your account. And you’ll get used to shouting at 
dazed employees in a harsh barking tone.
 
 After that, just enter your orders at the firm’s Web site, or phone them 
in. Ensure you have fast access to the trade-confirmation slip, and check 
it against the order you placed.
 
You can access your password-protected, discount-brokerage account on the 
Internet. You also can opt to receive periodic statements by mail. Either way, 
check the account information against your own records.
 
Using a discount broker is investing for grownups. No one is around to hold 
your tiny hand or coo into your tight little rosebud of an ear that “the market 
always comes back.” In return for the low commissions they charge, discount-
ers are geared to provide little or no personal service.
Why Discount Brokers Are a 
Great Place to Buy Funds
If you’re confident about making investment decisions yourself, a discount 
broker is the best place to buy and hold mutual funds. Discounters let you 
buy certain mutual funds for no upfront charge when other brokers would 
demand a commission. They also carry a vast selection of hundreds of 
mutual funds (more than any broker does), lots of bonds, and just about any 
stock you care to name. That means you can hold funds from a multitude of 
different companies — including some low-cost, no-load funds that are hard 
to buy from a broker or financial planner. And a discount brokerage account 
also lets you combine funds with your other investments, such as stocks or 
guaranteed investment certificates, so that all your holdings show up on one 
convenient statement.
Discounters are the perfect source for mutual funds because the choice is so 
huge and the charges are so low. Here’s a rundown of the other main reasons 
to strongly consider leaving your money with a discounter.

105
 Chapter 6: Discount Brokers: Cheap Thrills
Your one-stop shop — Convenience
Discount brokers are just extremely convenient. You can be on top of a 
mountain in Nepal, or in a jail cell in Ballydehob (say hello to Liam but don’t 
let him “arm wrestle” you), but as long as you can get access to the Internet 
or a telephone you should be able to sell or buy funds, stocks, and bonds in 
your discount brokerage account. By contrast, a full-service broker may be 
out of the office, ill, or busy, creating a delay if the backup person is slow.
Another reason to love discounters: They’ve embraced the Internet whole-
heartedly, with many letting you look at your account, and place orders, at 
any time over the Web. So if you enjoy surfing the Web, then a discounter is 
the place for you. With a discounter, you have control over what happens in 
your account. No salespeople are there to interfere or offer advice that may be 
tainted by the desire to earn sales commissions or — by orders from higher-
up, brutal Stalinist-style commands that blare from a cracked loudspeaker 
inches from the poor broker’s ear — to push a particular stock or fund.
Access to a broad selection of options
Wide selection is a powerful reason to go with a discount broker, because 
discounters sell just about everything. A bank branch or no-load fund com-
pany can generally sell you only its own funds, and a broker is likely to have 
a “select list” of funds with which he or she is most familiar. But a discount 
broker will let you buy hundreds of funds, as well as thousands of stocks and 
bonds, in North America and often on overseas markets as well. That means 
you can have the luxury of just one central portfolio that holds all your 
investments, instead of spreading them all around town.
Discounters have to carry every major fund because otherwise their com-
petitors will beat them on selection. Having every fund available can be very 
useful for you if you want to leave an underperforming fund. It means you 
have somewhere to move the money. If you’re with a broker who doesn’t sell 
the funds you want to switch to, however, you’re in trouble.
 
Many firms proclaim that they carry hundreds of funds, and in fact they prob-
ably do. But you’ll find that some low-cost funds from independent providers 
come with high minimum purchases of $5,000 and up. Always ask if the fund 
you’re interested in is available and find out about any conditions.

106
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
A wealth of investing information
Finally, discount brokers can be useful channels for getting hold of invest-
ing information. Check out their Web sites and you’ll find fee calculators and 
other useful online tools. Some may have offers of investment newsletters 
and books at cut-rate prices. A few discounters sell research reports from 
stock analysts at full-service brokerages — usually the brokerage owned by 
the discounter’s parent.
 
Research shows that most investment newsletters fail to beat the market over 
time. And brokerage analysts are notorious for seeing the world through rose-
coloured glasses; they rarely say a stock is a Sell because that’s certain to enrage 
the company’s management. Angry corporate managers are likely to cut the 
critical analyst off from information and may even blacklist his or her firm in the 
future when it comes to picking brokers to handle a stock issue or other deal.
At Last — A Break on Costs
One of the big pluses with discounters is the fact that most let you buy funds on 
a front-load basis at no initial cost to you. Front-load means that the fund buyer 
pays an upfront commission directly to the broker or financial planner at the 
time of purchase — the exact rate is negotiable, but it’s usually 3 percent or less 
these days, and sometimes as little as 1 percent. The advantage to paying a front 
load is that the funds can then be sold at any time with no further charges.
 
The discounters aren’t being particularly generous with their zero-load offer on 
front-load funds, mind you. Fund companies love it when their wares are sold 
front-load because they don’t have to pay any commission to the broker. So they 
pay an especially generous annual trailer commission — typically 1 percent of 
the client’s holding in an equity fund — to the broker that sold the fund when it 
was bought on a front-load basis. Trailer commissions are ongoing commissions 
that a salesperson or his or her firm gets as long as the client stays in the fund 
or funds sold by the manager. Paid by the fund company itself, trailer commis-
sions ultimately come out of the management fee your fund is charged. Big fat 
trailers on mutual funds sold on a front-load basis (even if the investor actually 
paid no load) are the reason why discounters are happy to let you have front-
load funds at what looks like no charge — they’re often indirectly collecting 1 
percent of your money each year from the fund company.
A word on commissions
Table 6-1 lists the major discounters, their Web sites, and their toll-free 
telephone numbers. Going online is the best way to check out commissions, 
which change as discounters jostle for market share. By the time you read 

107
 Chapter 6: Discount Brokers: Cheap Thrills
this, they’ll no doubt have come up with new special offers and dancing kit-
tens in little kilts. Check out the Web sites listed for all the latest and great-
est. Discounters need to recruit new clients because this is a volume-driven 
industry: If you’re not No. 1 or No. 2, you’re really an also-ran, limping down 
the home stretch with the glue-factory van waiting beside the stables. . . .
 
When looking at these prices, keep a few things in mind:
 
 Bank-owned discounters usually levy no fees at all if you’re buying or selling 
funds managed by their parent banks (and most outside funds as well). So, 
for example, if you’re dealing with Royal Bank of Canada’s discounter, RBC 
Direct Investing, you can sell Royal Bank’s no-load funds for free.
 
 Discounters generally require a $500 to $1,000 minimum investment if 
you’re buying mutual funds. It’s a low-margin business, after all, and tiny 
orders are just more trouble than they’re worth for the firm.
 
 Higher commission rates often apply if you place your order by talk-
ing to a person over the phone. For Internet and automated-telephone 
orders, the commissions are considerably lower. Note that some bro-
kers have fees for buying and selling certain funds, and fees for short-
term trading may also apply.

Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
 
In Chapter 2 we discuss the other type of mutual fund sales commission — the 
redemption charge, or back-end load. Funds sold on that basis charge you 
nothing upfront, but levy a commission if you sell the fund within six or seven 
years. Most discounters simply treat back-end loads like regular brokers do. 
When a client buys an equity fund on a redemption-charge basis, the broker 
collects a 5-percent commission directly from the fund company (not from 
the client). The firm then extracts any applicable redemption charges from 
the proceeds if the customer sells the fund early. Some discount brokers have 
tried “rebating” a portion of that 5-percent commission back to clients who buy 
deferred-load funds. It’s a nice little bonus, but it also makes the whole exer-
cise more complicated. You’ll do fine without it if you just buy front-load funds.
Back-end-load rebates and bonuses: As if life 
wasn’t complicated enough
We’re sorry to keep burdening you with all this 
commission stuff. And by now you’re probably 
wondering: Why is everyone in the fund indus-
try obsessed with sales charges? Why do they 
create myriad different classes of the same 
fund, each sold with a different commission, 
and drape them with incomprehensible condi-
tions, rules, and names? Well, the bottom line 
is that selling expenses — particularly the cost 
of paying commissions to brokers and financial 
planners — are an enormous cost of business 
for mutual fund companies. Let’s look at this 
example: Equity-fund salespeople, as a gen-
eral rule, get 1 percent of the client’s assets 
each year, either upfront or payable as an 
annual “trailer” commission. Well, the median 
Canadian equity fund charges an annual MER 
of 2.5 percent, so more than a third of the man-
agement fee revenue is going to the broker or 
financial planner who sold the fund.
Just one more commission complication before 
we leave the subject. Some discount brokers 
have tried taking the 5-percent commission they 
get from the company for selling a deferred-load 
fund and “rebating” some of it to the customer 
in the form of a bonus. For example, if you invest 
$10,000 in a fund on a back-end-load basis, and 
the discounter pays you a 2-percent bonus, 
then $10,200 would immediately show up in your 
account. Seems like you’re getting money for 
nothing. These rear-load rebates have ranged 
from 2 to almost 3 percent depending on which 
broker you’re dealing with — as long as you 
meet their many conditions.
Getting a bonus straight off the top like that 
sounds like a great deal, but it hasn’t proved 
popular with discount brokerage customers. 
That’s because with a deferred-load fund, 
you’re “locked in” by the commission you must 
pay to the fund company if you cash out within 
about six years. Discount brokerage customers 
are independent souls who don’t like having 
their hands tied in any way. So they have 
steered clear of rear-end-load funds carrying 
rebates, even if the funds looked like a real bar-
gain at first glance.
The bottom line? Sure, take advantage of a 
rebate if you’re certain you want to stay in the 
fund for several years (until the deferred load 
no longer applies), but don’t lose dollars just 
to save cents. If you think a possibility exists 
that you’ll want to sell the fund again while the 
back-end load is still in effect, then go with the 
front-load version to keep life simple and your 
investment strategy unencumbered.

 Chapter 6: Discount Brokers: Cheap Thrills
How to Pick a Discounter
Don’t get in a lather comparing the discounters’ commissions and totting up 
their special offers. Seeing people in the investment business offering to cut 
their prices is wonderful, but over the long term, saving $100 on a one-off 
basis doesn’t amount to much. If you plan to simply buy and hold high-quality 
funds and stocks, it doesn’t make a lot of difference if you’ve spent $100 or 
$200 in commissions building the portfolio. Yes, cheaper is always better, but 
fast and polite responses to your orders or questions, and investments that 
suit your needs, are just as important as low rates.
Getting a feel for the service
The important thing is efficient, accurate, and prompt service — something 
that, sadly, discounters seem to have had a problem providing in the past. 
After a debacle in the hectic stock market of early 2000, when some cli-
ents said they were left on the phone for up to a week, the discount firms 
embarked on a hiring frenzy aimed at ensuring they had enough staff to 
handle soaring demand. Service levels are better now — although lots of the 
credit goes to the fact that much of discount trading happens online nowa-
days, with no human intervention required.
Forget the personal touch
Select a discount broker carefully. Until a few 
years ago, service at too many of the firms 
tended to be spotty, with orders and requests 
sometimes going through incorrectly or after 
long delays. But those days happily appear to 
be behind us — and, of course, traditional “full-
service” brokers and financial planners can get 
orders wrong too.
Nonetheless, if you’re worried about getting 
trades executed on very busy market days, you 
might be more comfortable with one of the large 
bank-owned brokers, which are likely to have 
more people available to handle your calls, and 
which may have more robust Web sites for 
standing up to heavy traffic.
Generally, when dealing with a discounter, 
remember that the people answering the 
phone don’t know you (unless you’re a high 
roller who’s given special attention), so you 
can forget about getting much personalized 
help. Yes, some discounters are offering more 
research and information, but they’ll always be 
the port-of-call for resolute independent souls 
who want to make all their investing decisions 
for themselves.

110
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
 
If you’ve got the time and energy, you could pick a firm by first opening two 
or even three separate accounts at different discounters — signing up as a 
client generally doesn’t cost a cent. After a year or so, you’ll get a good feel 
for which discounter is most reliable and the easiest to use and you can trans-
fer all your assets there. Be sure to ask your family, friends, and work mates 
about their experience with discounters. If you keep coming across horror 
stories about a particular firm, then shop elsewhere.
Apart from commissions, the fee you’re most likely to face at a discount 
broker is an annual administration fee of roughly $40 to $100, although some 
no-charge brokerages do exist. In any event, some firms will waive RRSP fees 
if you have assets of $15,000 to $25,000 or more in the account.
 
Don’t worry too much about picking the right discounter. If you make the 
wrong choice, you can switch later at the cost of a few weeks’ wait and a fee of 
about $100. It’s messy — and watch out for mistakes while they transfer your 
investments — but you have a right to move.
Finding the right discounter for you
A good source of information on discount brokers (and low-cost investing in 
general) is the Stingy Investor Web site, at www.stingyinvestor.com. Run 
by avid number-cruncher Norman Rothery of Toronto, it offers a rundown of 
discounters’ rates. (Before deciding to use a particular firm, however, be sure 
to double-check fees with the brokerages you are considering.)
Don’t become obsessed with commission rates when choosing a discounter. 
Some have decided to market themselves as cut-price providers, offering 
minimum commissions for a stock trade that can run $25 or even less. That’s 
a tremendous deal for investors, but remember that if you don’t plan to trade 
stocks frequently, it’s only of limited value. Look at the whole picture — includ-
ing mutual fund commissions, service standards, and special options — before 
you make your choice.
Try calling the company a couple of times with questions. If you can’t seem 
to get decent answers, then consider going somewhere else.
 
Some experts advise using a discount broker not owned by your usual bank. 
That way, if a dispute over a trade ever occurs, the broker can’t just dip into 
your bank account and extract money.

111
 Chapter 6: Discount Brokers: Cheap Thrills
Considering a mutual 
fund discount broker
Apart from the true discount brokers, which are licensed to deal in stocks 
and bonds as well as funds, investors also can choose from among dozens 
of “no-load” or “discount” mutual fund dealers that sell only mutual funds. 
These companies, which are often happy to buy and sell funds over the tele-
phone, usually charge no commission on front-load funds, living off the rich 
trailer payment instead. Individual stockbrokers and financial planners also 
frequently offer to sell funds with no load.
Discount fund dealers will clearly save you money, and if you’re happy with 
the level of service available and the selection of funds, then go with one. 
But, once again, don’t let cost be the only deciding factor. Saving yourself a 
one-off expense of 2 percent is pointless if the dealer subsequently doesn’t 
give you enough advice and choice of products.
 
From our perspective, if we were looking to save money we’d stick to a regular 
discount broker who’s able to sell us shares and bonds as well as funds while 
also offering low commissions. Call us scaredy-cats, but we’d rather deal with 
a discounter that’s a large multi-billion-dollar organization. That way, we know 
the systems are in place to administer our accounts properly.
What’s Wrong with Discount Brokers?
The major problem with discounters, especially for investors who are just 
getting going, is that they do not provide advice on your personal financial 
situation or help you create a financial plan. A discounter is essentially a tool 
for doing transactions — but buying and selling investments is only part of 
getting rich. A good planner or full-service stockbroker will also provide tips 
on tax and wealth management — using life insurance, for example — that 
you won’t get from a discounter.
Getting seduced and abandoned
Discounters leave you on your own to make all the decisions, but freedom 
can bring problems. Some research seems to show that retail investors 
who work without an adviser don’t do well because they’re prone to buying 
high and selling low. That is, they euphorically buy shares and equity funds 
when the market has soared and then dump them when prices have already 

112
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
crashed. That may be true or just a self-serving myth fostered by the broker-
age industry. But a good fund salesperson can impose valuable discipline in 
two ways: by getting you to save money in the first place and by persuading 
you to hang on when things look bleak.
So if you’re a nervous or impulsive type, holding your stocks and funds at 
a discount broker might be a recipe for panic selling and hysterical buying. 
Perhaps you’d be better off with a planner or old-style broker.
Knowing when to stay away
Although the lure of cheap trades and special offers may be pretty hard to 
resist, discounters aren’t for every Canadian, not even close. Some investors 
should probably stay away from discounters. For example:
 
 Nervous investors who are just starting out might be happier opening a 
mutual fund account at a bank first. They can get at least some personal-
ized help while they learn the basics of investing, before venturing into 
the discount world.
 
 Those who plan to trade frequently in and out of the stock market might 
be better off going with a competent traditional stockbroker who’ll give 
them a break on commissions. Full-service brokers are more expensive, 
but they can often provide better “execution” of your orders — that is, 
they can buy and sell stocks at more attractive prices.

Banks: The Fast Food of Funds
In This Chapter
 Discovering why banks are the simplest place to buy mutual funds
 Dealing with your bank
 Bank funds to consider for your portfolio
A
 decade ago, the banks didn’t seem to be able to run a decent equity 
fund. Those days are long gone. The banks’ equity funds have been 
strong performers in recent years. Plus they have reduced the costs charged 
to mutual fund investors, thanks in some part to their lineups of index funds, 
which simply track the entire market (we take a closer look at index funds 
in Chapter 15). Expenses also have been kept down thanks to Internet sales, 
which are cheap to process. In most cases, a bank-fund purchase is no far-
ther than a mouse-click away from your online bank account statement page. 
So, perks to keeping your investments where you keep your cash do exist. No 
meddlesome salespeople are involved.
In this chapter, we explain why banks are a great place to buy mutual funds, 
especially if you just want a simple option that’s also an okay value. This 
chapter shows why you can just go ahead and use your local bank branch for 
mutual funds if you want a quick solution. You might not get the best bargain 
going or make the most money, but it’ll do the job.
Buying Where You Bank
Banks are the very simplest place to buy mutual funds: Just walk in (virtually or 
to a branch) and put your money into a selection of the house brands. But don’t 
assume they’re the best choice. A bank is a great place to start out buying funds, 
but certainly do take a long, hard look at what they can and can’t offer.
Hey, you’re busy, what with training your cat to play the xylophone (“No, the 
left paw!”) and getting into the Guinness Book of Records for growing the lon-
gest nose hairs ever officially recorded (that old fool in Sinkiang-Uigar glued 

114
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
them in). So why not just make things easy on yourself and simply grab your 
mutual funds at the bank? Mutual fund buyers, especially rookies, can do well 
at the bank for a number of reasons.
Providing one-stop shopping
Even if you don’t have an account with a bank, you can still walk into a 
branch, hand over a cheque, and sign up for a mutual fund account. Okay, 
it might take a couple of days to arrange an appointment with a registered 
representative, a bank employee who is licensed to sell funds, but after that 
the process should be painless. Most banks have telephone services for 
buying and selling funds after you’ve opened a fund account, and nearly all 
offer telephone and Internet services that let you check your account balance 
and recent transactions. In fact, most banks will let you open a mutual fund 
investing account online, as part of your banking account access. (In some 
cases you might have to set up an online account in person at a branch.)
 
Banks sell their own funds on a no-load basis — no commissions or sales 
loads. That means all your money goes to work for you right away, and you 
can cash out at any time with no penalty (although companies impose a short-
term trading penalty, typically 2 percent, on those who sell a fund within 30 to 
90 days, depending on the specific fund).
You can set up a fairly decent mutual fund registered retirement savings 
plan — a tax-sheltered account of retirement money — at a bank in half an 
hour flat by simply buying one of their pre-selected fund packages. Staff are 
trained to sell these mixtures, and questionnaires are designed to slot you 
into the right one so you’re likely to get a reasonable fit. See Chapter 20 on 
fund packages for more about this type of product.
Keeping it together
Most likely you have your mortgage, line of credit, and chequing account at a 
bank. So buying mutual funds from the company that already holds the mort-
gage on your house means you can take care of everything in one place, be it 
a branch, at the bank’s Internet site, or on the phone.
 
Offering to move your mutual fund business to a bank can radically improve 
your bargaining power when seeking a loan or mortgage. Bank employees 
get little chocolate soccer balls as rewards when their customers bring their 
investment portfolios to the branch. Use this to your advantage when looking 
to extend your credit, take a plunge into the real estate market, or buy a car. 
In today’s competitive banking environment, an investor with a portfolio is a 
sought-after prize.

115
 Chapter 7: Banks: The Fast Food of Funds
Offering appealing options
The employees you deal with at a bank branch or on the telephone are paid 
wages, so they’re not commission-driven jackals. But they usually sell only 
the house brand. And yes, they receive incentives to attract business, and 
yes, the banks tend to be vague on exactly what bonuses are paid.
 
For the most part, you’ll find that banks are happy to sell you index funds — 
low-expense funds that simply track the stock- or bond-market index or bench-
mark. Index funds are such a good deal they should be part of every investor’s 
arsenal, although we suggest you also have between one-third and one-half of 
your stock market investments in traditional actively managed funds, featur-
ing a person who buys and sells investments in search of trading profits.
 
Banks, unlike mutual fund companies that market their products through 
commission-paid salespeople, are able to make money from running index 
funds because they don’t have to pay out those big commissions. Most offer 
index funds with low expenses — around 1 percent or less — compared with 
2.3 to 2.4 percent on, for example, the median Canadian equity mutual fund. If 
you were to simply walk into a branch and open up a mutual fund account full 
of index funds like that, chances are you’d do better than millions of mutual 
fund investors. For that matter, almost all of the banks’ actively managed 
(non-index-based) mutual funds have expenses that are less than the category 
medians.
Fighting for the right to serve you
The banks are hungry for your mutual fund business and they’re willing to 
cut prices and improve service to get it. The fantastic growth of the Canadian 
mutual fund industry, with assets soaring to more than $700 billion in mid-
2008 from less than $30 billion in 1990, has represented a migration of cash 
from bank savings accounts and guaranteed investment certificates into 
funds. The banks have been working very hard to hold on to as much of that 
money as they can.
Another reason why the banks are fund-mad: Mutual funds are a wonderfully 
profitable and low-risk business. The management company just keeps raking 
in those fees no matter how well or badly the fund does. That must be a great 
comfort to Canadians invested in U.S. equity funds; the median U.S. stock 
fund lost nearly 11 percent during 2007.
 
Lending money, banks’ traditional way of making a profit, is more risky than 
selling mutual funds because borrowers can default and interest rates can 
jump, leaving the banks stuck with a pile of underpriced loans. So the banks 
have reinvented themselves as “wealth management” companies, and mutual 
funds are key players in that ballgame.

116
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
Buyer Beware: Shortfalls 
in Bank Offerings
Nobody’s perfect, and buying funds at a bank — online, on the phone, or in 
person — has its drawbacks. Here, for your viewing pleasure, are the draw-
backs of lining the pockets of nasal, power-hungry guys from Quebec and 
New Brunswick, the sort who become bank chairmen.
Few options
The big problem is lack of choice: The banks have been in no hurry to market 
other companies’ funds because a banker likes sharing fees like a lobster 
enjoys taking a hot bath. That means customers are often stuck with the 
bank’s line of products, which isn’t always the strongest. More and more 
bank employees have personal finance training, but most aren’t specialists in 
the field. To get a full analysis of your situation, you may still have to go to a 
planner working for an independent firm.
 
The narrow selection of funds at many branches is the biggest problem with 
buying from a bank. Most of the big banks offer a full range of funds under 
their own brand name, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that their Canadian 
equity or global equity funds will be any good. And even if you try to build a 
diversified fund portfolio by buying the bank’s index funds and actively man-
aged funds as well, you run a risk you’re leaving too much money with just 
one investment team. Let’s say a particular coterie usually tends to get excited 
about flashy technology stocks — then you’re likely to lose money when 
other investors get tired of such high-priced, science fiction tales. You can 
get around this lack of diversification — the annoying word for spreading out 
your investments — by opening an account elsewhere as well, perhaps with 
another bank. Or you can at least increase your diversification by buying sev-
eral of the bank’s actively managed funds.
Overworked and underpaid: Not 
just you, some bankers too
With the rapid growth in online banking and investing, it’s getting harder and 
harder to talk to an actual human being unless you’ve got a whopping bal-
ance in your account. That’s a drag, and it’s a disadvantage of going to a bank 
if you’d rather deal with a person than peck at the keyboard of a machine 
(what’s wrong with you, anyway?). Banks may be losing their traditional 
advantage of owning huge networks of physical branches, because all their 
competitors are as easily accessed online as they are. Well, almost, because 
you likely visit your banking Web site every week anyway.

117
 Chapter 7: Banks: The Fast Food of Funds
Lack of pressure to perform
Customers who buy funds from a bank are isolated in the sense that the fund 
managers don’t have brokers and other salespeople breathing in a damp, 
hot way down their necks, insisting on good returns. If a broker-sold fund’s 
performance goes into the tank, salespeople get angry and embarrassed 
because they have to face the clients they put into the loser. That’s never a 
fun session. The sales force demands explanations from the manager. So the 
presence of salespeople probably serves to impose some discipline on fund 
companies. With bank funds where no brokers are involved, terrible perfor-
mance used to drag on for years with little publicity or outcry.
 
Banks now take funds more seriously, meaning that problems get fixed fairly 
quickly, but bank fund unitholders arguably still don’t have anyone looking 
out for their interests. Yes, nearly all mutual funds have “trustees” who theo-
retically are on the side of investors, but we’ve yet to hear of a fund trustee 
saying a single critical word about a fund’s management or expenses. Most 
unitholders wouldn’t know where to look for the trustees’ names and no 
wonder — you have to dig deep into a financial report to find them. However, 
this search is less onerous now that fund companies are obligated to pro-
duce a management report of fund performance twice a year (see Chapter 3 
for more on MRFPs). You no longer have to plow through a fund’s obscure 
“annual information form” to identify the trustees.
 
Another problem with buying funds from your bank is that, well, you’re forced 
to deal with a bank. The Internet has made this a lot easier, but if you need to 
reach them by phone, your calls may get routed to on-hold hell or voice-mail 
purgatory before they end up in the bottomless pit of general delivery, with 
Tats in shipping. Increasingly, bank customers are being asked to telephone 
a central information line (1-800-PLS-HOLD) or go to an Internet site (which 
saves the bank a packet). This is intended to relieve some of the pressure on 
branch staff, who usually have to deal with all the other services and prod-
ucts the bank delivers and then face the whining, puking, and foot-stamping 
at home (not to mention the kids). So you might not get the sort of personal 
attention and time that a good financial planner or even stockbroker delivers.
How Banks Pulled Up Their Socks
Performance of bank-run equity funds has greatly improved during the past 
decade, although the banks still haven’t built much of a record in global 
equity funds. (Their fixed-income funds have long been okay.) In the past, 
bank stock funds lagged the competition by a wide margin. They seemed to 
have difficulty attracting and keeping gifted fund managers (if such a thing as 
stock-picking talent exists, as opposed to sheer luck). Explanations varied, 
but one problem seemed to be that hot fund managers demand lavish pay-
cheques and bonuses — but if the banks were to pay such huge amounts to 

118
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
a few individuals, managers elsewhere in their vast dreary bureaucracies 
would get jealous in a grey, whining way. To some extent, though, the banks 
seemed to have fixed their performance problems, in some cases by spinning 
off their portfolio management operations into separate companies.
But that has changed. Some bank fund managers have achieved prominence 
and turned up on portfolio manager round tables at conferences and in print. 
More important, the funds’ numbers are quite strong. Table 7-1 shows the 
three biggest bank funds in the Canadian equity funds as of mid-2008. As you 
can see, over five years these giants (with a combined $11 billion in assets) 
all beat — or stacked up well against — the median fund return and the S&P/
TSX composite index. Over ten years all three outpaced both the median and 
the index. Mind you, the people running bank funds arguably had an advan-
tage in recent years because, wow, bank stocks have done so well they’re just 
the sort of stuff that conservative bank funds tend to hold.
Mutual funds have now become such an important business for the banks 
that it’s very unlikely an equity fund would be allowed to drift along with 
poor numbers for very long before the manager was reassigned . . . to check-
ing mortgage applications . . . in Tuktoyaktuk.

Improving your choice of funds
Banks branches now have staff who are registered to sell other companies’ 
funds (known in the jargon as third-party funds). However, don’t expect to 
be able to buy any fund you want at a bank branch; it seems in-branch reps 
are most keen on training their staff to talk about funds from companies such 
as AGF Management Ltd., AIM Funds Management Inc., CI Funds Inc., Fidelity 
Investments Canada Ltd., Mackenzie Financial Corp., and Franklin Templeton 
Investments. Those are all honourable companies, but they also happen to 
be commission-paying fund sponsors that sell their products through bro-
kers and planners — which means that the banks are in line for a gush of 
commission income in return for selling their wares.

119
 Chapter 7: Banks: The Fast Food of Funds
Stretching the rules with bank offerings
You can create a widely diversified portfolio from the funds of just one bank 
by using a bit of ingenuity. In Chapter 4, we recommend portfolios whose 
equity portion is made up of a Canadian index fund and an international and 
U.S. index fund, plus a couple of actively managed Canadian and two global 
actively managed funds. (Global equity funds buy shares everywhere, but 
international funds stay out of North America.) Achieving that kind of broad 
mix used to take a good bit of work, but the banks, along with most large fund 
companies, now offer a wide selection of packaged portfolios. (We explain 
these “fund packages” in Chapter 20.) Table 7-2 shows one such package, the 
Scotia Selected Balanced Income & Growth Portfolio (a balanced portfolio 
consisting of Bank of Nova Scotia funds) in mid-2008. This is a traditional, 
cautious mix, with 54 percent of the assets in stocks and 46 percent in fixed 
income. Half of the equity exposure is to U.S. and other foreign stocks. (This 
holdings information was as of the end of 2007.)

A Few Gems from the Banks
 
Below we discuss three bank funds (as selected for us by Morningstar’s fund-
analysis team) that have produced solid returns in recent years. Will their 
good performance continue? Impossible to tell. However, Morningstar’s ana-
lysts favour funds with strong management, good long-term performance, and 
relatively low expenses. (Modest costs always load the dice in favour of the 
investor.) Check out these three funds:

120
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
 
 Renaissance Global Markets: Long term is the name of the game for this 
CIBC fund, which invests for the long term and holds only companies 
that have solid long-term track records. Ironically, the fund’s own long-
term performance is unimpressive. But the fund got a new manager in 
late 2006 and has been transformed from a stodgy index hugger to an 
exciting, actively managed portfolio. The result has been promising, as 
the new manager — David Winters, formerly with Franklin Templeton — 
outperformed the MSCI World Index during his first year and a half on 
the job. What’s more, this has been achieved at a lower cost; the fund’s 
annual expenses have come down since his arrival.
 
 RBC Global Precious Metals: Why buy a precious metals fund if the 
price of gold has shot through the roof in recent years? This fund is 
much more than a holder of gold-mining companies. Unlike in some pre-
cious metals funds, this fund’s manager, Chris Beer, has a mandate to 
invest as much as 20 percent of the fund’s portfolio in silver and plati-
num producers. Better still, he is known for his talent at identifying com-
panies that are able to efficiently mine metals and have a good record 
of delivering and financing an exploration project. But be aware that 
precious metals funds aren’t for the faint of heart and should represent 
only a small part of your investment portfolio. This fund is also a good 
bet because it sports the lowest annual expenses in the precious metals 
category, at 2.07 percent.
 
 TD Entertainment and Communications: Now here we have something 
unusual: A truly unique bank-run fund. Its mandate allows it to invest 
in stocks of all sizes in such sectors as telecom, media, IT services, 
Internet, advertising, and broadcasting. And it does so with a lower risk 
profile than many other funds in its category (global equity). This comes 
partly from a fund mandate that allows the manager to hold up to one-
fifth of the fund’s value outside its core investment areas of media and 
telecom. That’s not to say considerable risks don’t exist if you buy this 
fund, so hold it only as a small dose. View it as the entertaining corner of 
your portfolio. However, with annual expenses of 2.7 percent, the price 
of admission is a little high.

C
ivilization may run out of water, out of brain surgeons, out of Vancouver 
Island marmots, and out of braying, self-important, financial journalists. 
But it’ll never run out of mutual fund salespeople. At least 50,000 Canadians 
hold themselves out as financial advisers or planners in one way or another, 
and most of them are licensed to sell you mutual funds. They come in a bewil-
dering range of guises, from Boss-suited executives in the downtown core 
of big cities to down-home types wolfing down the free sandwiches at fund 
company lunches. And they give themselves a galaxy of names: financial con-
sultant, investment counsellor, estate planner, financial adviser, investment 
executive, personal financial planner. Don’t get worked up trying to figure out 
the differences among them. Financial planning remains a mostly self-regulated 
industry, if at all, although a few national industry groups like Advocis and 
the Financial Planners Standards Council do exist.
In this chapter, we describe the main types of fund salespeople and tell you 
about the advantages of using financial planners who charge only an upfront 
or annual fee, rather than collect commissions on the products they sell 
you. We also provide some basic tips on the right and wrong ways to pick an 
adviser.

Alphabet Soup: Figuring 
Out All those Titles
You could spend a good month or two crafting a long list of all the elaborate 
titles financial advisers give themselves. You could then have a couple of 
gloomy women in leotards read it out on a darkened stage at the Toronto 
Fringe Festival, to the accompaniment of randomly played cymbals and 
flutes. Probably be a huge hit — better than the usual dreary one-person 
show about a failed actor, anyway — but it wouldn’t help people much with 
their financial planning. So how do you wade through all the options and get 
down to what’s best for you and your money? That’s the key — your first 
challenge should be figuring out exactly what kind of financial planning you 
want rather than trying to decode their titles. In other words, do you need a 
fast once-over or a harrowing session of soul-searching?
After you’ve decided you need some help drawing up a financial plan and 
picking the right mutual funds, ask yourself two questions:
 
 Do I want just a quick solution or a complete financial plan? If you’re 
reasonably comfortable with your money arrangements as they stand 
and you just want someone who’ll suggest a few funds, then you can 
keep things simple by going to a storefront mutual fund dealer, a stock-
broker, or a bank. They can recommend a package of funds and set up 
the account for you. If, however, you want help planning your fiscal 
future, make sure you deal with someone who has had some formal 
financial planning training (more on that later) and is also genuinely 
interested in the subject. And the best choice of all is to go with an unbi-
ased planner who charges you a separate fee for his or her expertise, 
instead of selling you mutual funds that pay them a commission.
 
 How much money will I be investing? Don’t expect miracles. If you’re 
planning to put $5,000 a year into your fund portfolio, the chairman of 
CIBC Wood Gundy Inc. won’t be asking you out to golf. It can be a good 
idea to tell the adviser upfront how much you think you’re likely to save 
each year. You’ll often be able to tell from his or her reaction whether 
you’re likely to get much in the way of attention or advice.
 
Here’s a great way to find out if a fund salesperson is likely to be of much use 
in drawing up a financial plan: Don’t just ask about investing. Also bring up 
subjects such as buying disability and life insurance, estate planning, and min-
imizing taxes. If the answers are superficial or unsatisfactory, then this person 
probably isn’t the best adviser to help you build a successful plan.

123
 Chapter 8: Stockbrokers, Financial Planners, and Advisers Aplenty
Drawing up a comprehensive financial plan is a complicated process, cov-
ering the client’s taxes, income, spending, and retirement plans. Choosing 
investments is only a small part of that, but many advisers are paid just for 
selling life insurance or mutual funds, so saving and investing become all 
they want to talk about. In fact, as we outline in Chapter 4, every competent 
financial planner worth his or her salt should emphasize getting rid of high-
interest debt as your first step toward sound money management. If they 
don’t look at your whole financial picture, look elsewhere for help. So beware 
of commission-paid salespeople who encourage you to go ahead and buy 
funds even though you already have big credit card debts. This is no way to 
build a sound financial plan or invest for profit.
 
Be sure a financial planner is qualified. The Institute of Advanced Financial 
Planners (IAFP) has some good guidelines. Check out the Consumer Guide sec-
tion of the IAFP Web site at www.iafp.ca. Advocis also has excellent infor-
mation in its Consumer Info section at www.advocis.ca.
Advisers can be divided into several main groups according to how they earn 
their living: You’ll find advisers who
 
 Get paid a commission for selling you investments.
 
 Charge a one-time fee for producing a financial plan, without specific 
investment advice.
 
 Charge you a separate fee for designing an investment portfolio.
 
 Earn a salary from an organization such as a bank that markets its own 
line of investments.
Commissioned advisers
The vast majority of Canadians choose to go with a financial adviser who gets 
paid by a mutual fund company or insurance company for selling investment 
“products.” In part that could be a reflection of the nation’s thrifty Scottish 
psyche. Unlike many Americans, Canadians seem to prefer having the 
expense of investing advice hidden from them, buried in the fee of a mutual 
fund or the cost of insurance. That way, it seems so much less painful than 
having to cut the adviser a cheque.
An obvious example of a commission-paid salesperson is the traditional stock-
broker, who makes money when you buy stocks, bonds, or funds. The broker 
gets a transaction fee, or commission, each time you put an order through.

124
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
 
 With stocks, the commission is added onto the cost when you buy or 
is deducted from the proceeds when you sell — and your transaction 
confirmation should clearly show how much was charged. For example, 
when you buy or sell $10,000 worth of shares, you can expect to pay a 
sales commission of about $300.
 
 With bonds, the “commission” is normally a profit margin that’s hidden 
in the price, just like buying a pair of jeans at the Gap. That’s because 
brokers usually sell to their clients bonds that they already own them-
selves. No separate commission is charged or shown on your confirma-
tion slip because the broker has already taken a markup.
 
 With funds, things get more complicated. But the essence of the system 
is that the broker (or financial planner or insurance salesperson) is paid 
by the fund company. The fund company, remember, charges an annual 
management fee — which is deducted from the assets of the fund — and 
pays roughly half of that out to the salesperson.
Commission-paid salespeople also include life insurance salespeople, 
whether independent or tied to a particular insurance company. In addition 
to life insurance, these agents are often licensed to sell mutual funds or the 
insurance industry’s version of mutual funds, which are known as segregated 
funds. Segregated funds — so-called because their assets must be kept sepa-
rate from those of the insurance company — carry guarantees to refund up 
to 100 percent of an investor’s initial outlay. More on those in Chapter 19.
Finally, Canada is home to thousands of financial planners, either in fran-
chises, chains of stores, or small independent offices, whose bread and 
butter is the mutual fund.
Fee-only financial planners
The next group is far smaller but represents an excellent choice for those 
who don’t mind signing a cheque to get advice. They’re fee-only financial 
planners who aren’t interested in selling products. In fact, they are not 
licensed to sell products. Fee-only planners will draw up a financial plan that 
addresses your entire money situation and sets personal financial goals, both 
near term and far. A good financial plan helps you set broad investing goals 
but does not discuss specific investments, or even market sectors. Rather, 
it points you in the right investing direction based on your present lifestyle 
needs, tax situation, insurance needs, and estate planning goals, among other 
factors. You must go to a licensed investment adviser, commissioned or fee-
based, to construct and maintain an investment portfolio.

125
 Chapter 8: Stockbrokers, Financial Planners, and Advisers Aplenty
A properly executed, custom financial plan will cost $1,000 or more, although 
some acceptable — but less customized — financial plans are available for 
a few hundred dollars. These plans are created by planners who use off-the-
shelf computer software.
 
A fee-only financial planner might produce a plan and then refer you to a 
commission-charging dealer — or even collect commissions on funds you buy 
under the table. First, such practices are illegal. Second, that kind of double-
charging adds another layer of complexity and fees, and it might not be the 
best deal for you. If the adviser is simply putting you into funds that pay com-
missions to salespeople, then why did you pay a fee for advice?
Fee-based investment advisers
Unlike fee-only financial planners, fee-based investment advisers are licensed 
investment salespeople who can be affiliated with a traditional stockbroker-
age firm, a mutual fund dealer, or a financial planning firm. The drawback of 
going with a fee-based adviser is the pain of paying the freight, which can be 
substantial. It might be a fee based on assets under management — a per-
centage of your investments (typically 1 or 2 percent) — or it can be a charge 
that ranges from $100 an hour to a few hundred, depending on the complex-
ity of your affairs.
With a fee-charging planner, you may have to make more choices about the 
investments you buy and the strategy you adopt. That’s because the financial 
plan produced for each client is different, reflecting individual needs and 
wants, whereas commission-paid salespeople are often happiest suggesting 
a predesigned and relatively fixed package of funds that leaves you with few 
decisions to make.
 
Investors with substantial assets — say, approaching $1 million — should 
strongly consider going with a fee-charging planner. Your accountant or 
lawyer may offer the service or may be willing to recommend someone. The 
fee will often run into several hundred dollars, but that’s a bargain compared 
with the hidden cost of high mutual fund management fees levied by fund 
companies that sell through commissioned advisers.
Salaried advisers
Thousands of financial advisers are being trained by the banks to take over 
the “wealth-management” needs of the aging baby boomers. They’re gener-
ally on salary — plus bonuses if they can persuade you to put your savings 
into one of the bank’s products, usually mutual funds or some other kind of 
managed-money program.

126
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
As we explain in Chapter 7, these bank employees are often limited in the 
products they can offer, and their training may not be as full as that of brokers 
or specialized financial planners. That means their advice should always be 
taken with a pinch of salt: They’re employed to push the bank’s products or 
sell funds that pay the bank a fat commission. Still, especially for investors 
with relatively simple needs and clear financial goals, the bank can be a great 
place to start off investing. Compared with the hard-driving world of brokers or 
financial planners, little sales pressure occurs. The product choices are simple, 
and having all your money in one place makes for easy recordkeeping.
But don’t forget you’re doing the bank a favour by handing over your savings. 
That means you’re entitled to a helpful and experienced bank employee, not 
some rookie or sleepyhead. And don’t get railroaded into buying one of the 
fixed arrangements of funds the banks love to pitch (it makes their adminis-
tration much easier, for one thing). If you feel that none of the pre-selected 
packages meets your needs, insist on a custom mixture of funds.
In general, the bank is the perfect first stop for starting-out investors who 
have only a few thousand dollars at their disposal. The banks are equipped 
to deal with small accounts and they have handy automated systems that 
allow you to check your account balance and transactions without waiting 
for someone to get back to you.
And banks’ employee training in investment advice is getting better all the 
time as the wealth-management business becomes vital to their future profit 
growth. Some banks even have qualified brokers available in the branch who 
can sell you a range of stocks and bonds or funds from nearly every company.
 
The blurred distinctions among all these types of commission-paid advisers 
make the whole business of looking for help confusing. But at least you have 
one thing going for you: Remember that if you buy mutual funds, your money 
is reasonably safe because it goes to the fund company instead of staying 
with the broker or dealer. So if you decide to dump your salesperson and his 
or her firm, you can simply shift the account elsewhere, after some whinge-
ing and delays on the part of the old salesperson. Your money is doubly safe 
because even the fund company itself has to leave the fund’s assets with a 
separate custodian for safekeeping.
 
Make sure you’ll be receiving a statement at least twice a year from the fund 
company (ask to see a sample) so you can be certain you’re on the fund com-
pany’s books. And make your cheque out to the fund company, not to the 
salesperson. Finally, get transaction confirmations for your purchases from 
the company — alternatively, you can call the fund company itself to double-
check that they have a record of your investment.

127
 Chapter 8: Stockbrokers, Financial Planners, and Advisers Aplenty
Deciding Whether to Pay a Fee 
or a Commission
Your first decision when selecting an adviser is this: Do you want to pay a fee 
to a fee-based adviser, or are you happy with a commission-collecting sales-
person? Don’t rush your decision and refuse to pay a fee upfront. For example, 
the first time Andrew went to a tax accountant, he agreed to pay a couple of 
hundred dollars to have the accountant look over his taxes and file his return. 
He got back a much bigger refund than he would have on his own, and it felt 
great to have a professional working for him. And because he was paying the 
accountant a fee, he knew what was motivating him.
Paying fees
The first step in hiring an adviser is to look for fee transparency. A fee-only 
planner or fee-based adviser charges by the hour or by the project (say, 
producing a financial plan). A fee-based adviser is licensed and may charge 
by the hour or by assets under management, and/or earn commission for 
product sales. A commissioned adviser depends entirely on product sales to 
cover the cost of doing planning work.
In any case, insist on an “engagement letter” stating what the adviser will be 
doing for you and how you will be paying for it. That way, you’ve separated 
or “unbundled” the advice from the sale of the investment product.
Be realistic. If you have only a few thousand dollars to invest, the commissions 
are not going to cover much. If you want planning, you’ll have to pay extra. 
Competent professionals don’t come cheap. Fee-only planners and accoun-
tants will almost certainly charge from several hundred to several thousand 
dollars to produce anything more than a “quickie” plan. Be aware that a fee-
only adviser is not licensed to provide specific investment advice, so you still 
have to find someone to help purchase and manage your investments.
Going with a commission-paid adviser
You often indirectly pay hundreds of dollars to invest in mutual funds. 
Frequently, commissioned advisers are able and willing to provide significant 
planning in return for your investment business.

128
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
Fee-charging advisers who’ll also help with investing are easier to find in 
Canada than was the case a few years ago, although you’ll have to ask around 
to find one. Canadians by the millions use commission-paid salespeople. 
After all, such advisers offer a handy one-stop solution: a financial roadmap 
of sorts and the glitz and comfort of a mutual fund from a familiar name — all 
backed up by gorgeous brochures and torrents of advertising in the press 
and on television, and increasingly on Internet sites. Most of them do a rea-
sonable job for clients, putting them into solid (if overpriced) funds and get-
ting them to save money, the first step in wealth accumulation.
Follow the money
Here’s a breakdown of how you pay the adviser 
and his or her firm hundreds of dollars, directly 
or indirectly, when you buy broker-sold funds.
Say you have a total of $10,000 to invest in a 
mutual fund. You usually have two choices:
  Buy the fund with a “front load” or “sales 
charge.” If you purchase this way, the sales 
charge — usually 0 to 2 percent, depending 
on what you can negotiate — is deducted 
from your investment and the balance is 
used to purchase the mutual fund. Under 
this option, you may sell your mutual fund 
at any time with no further sales charges.
  Buy the funds with a “redemption charge” 
(also called “deferred sales charge” or 
“back-end load”). In this case, the fund 
company pays the adviser’s firm a com-
mission, but no deduction is taken from 
your purchase amount and all your money 
goes into the investment. However, you’re 
on the fee hook if you sell within a speci-
fied period, typically seven years. The size 
of the redemption fee declines as time 
goes by, and you will not have to pay the 
fee if you keep your investment within the 
fund’s “family.” Some back-end load funds 
are called “low-load” and have a two-year 
redemption charge period.
How much is the adviser paid? If you buy the 
funds with a front load and pay a 1 percent 
upfront commission, the adviser’s firm is imme-
diately paid $100. The adviser gets a portion of 
this, generally 40 to 70 percent. If we assume a 
60 percent split, he or she makes $60 on your 
$10,000 investment. If you buy the fund on a 
redemption-charge basis, the adviser’s firm is 
paid a commission from the fund company — 
usually 5 percent of the amount invested, or 
$500. Again, if the split is 60 percent, your 
adviser will be paid $300.
The adviser’s firm is also paid a “trailer” com-
mission from the fund company, usually 1 per-
cent per year on equity funds (less on balanced 
or bond funds) purchased on a front-load basis. 
The trailer is half that amount if the fund is pur-
chased with a redemption charge. The trailer 
fee remunerates the adviser for providing ongo-
ing service to you. Assuming a $10,000 invest-
ment, the trailer will vary from $25 to $100 per 
year, depending on the fund purchased. The 
trailer is part of the fund management fee and 
is based on the market value of your funds. If 
your fund increases in value, the trailer will be 
higher; if it decreases, it will be lower. So if you 
prosper, so does your adviser, and vice versa.

129
 Chapter 8: Stockbrokers, Financial Planners, and Advisers Aplenty
Imagine a confusing, tangled jungle where every plant, animal, and weird 
fungus is grey. Well, that’s kind of like the financial planning scene in Canada, 
where investors are confronted by competing trade associations, duelling 
regulators, and rival professional qualifications. Except in Quebec and British 
Columbia, just about anyone can call himself or herself a financial planner — 
even with no training.
Progress has occurred on the self-regulatory front, however. Many financial 
planners are members of Advocis, a national umbrella group formed in 2002 
through the merger of the Canadian Association of Insurance and Financial 
Advisors (CAIFA) and the Canadian Association of Financial Planners 
(CAFP). The much smaller Institute of Advanced Financial Planners (IAFP) 
was formed by a group of financial planners who saw a need to promote 
the former CAFP’s professional designation, the RFP or Registered Financial 
Planner. Also significant was the creation of the Financial Planners Standards 
Council (FPSC) in 1995 by Advocis, groups representing the three account-
ing professions, and the credit unions. The FPSC is the official administra-
tor of the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation in Canada. Although 
not legally required, the CFP is regarded as the minimum qualification for a 
Canadian financial planner. The IAFP believes its RFP designation is superior, 
but of course that falls into the category of debate.
Commission-paid salespeople and advisers usually fit into one of these three 
groups:
 
 Stockbrokers: They often like to be known by more touchy-feely names 
such as “investment adviser” and are at the top of the food chain. 
They work for fairly tightly regulated traditional brokerage firms, the 
biggest of which are owned by the major banks. Examples include 
RBC Dominion Securities, CIBC Wood Gundy, and BMO Nesbitt Burns. 
Because brokerage firms generally are geared to dealing with relatively 
wealthy clients, a broker usually won’t give you too much time unless 
you have $100,000 or so to invest. He or she may take you on as a client 
if you have less money than that, but don’t expect fawning attention, 
just a meeting or two per year at most. For those with enough money, 
brokers can be an excellent choice because they can sell anything — 
including stocks, bonds, funds, and a range of more exotic investments. 
Another plus: Their training and in-house support are fairly good.
 
 On the negative side, be aware that many brokers are obligated to pro-
mote stocks and other securities that are underwritten by their firm’s 
investment bankers.
 
 Stockbrokerages are self-regulated by the Investment Dealers 
Association of Canada (IDA), and are members of one or more stock 
exchanges. Find out more about the IDA online at www.ida.ca, or con-
tact them at 121 King Street West, Suite 1600, Toronto, ON M5H 3T9.

130
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
 
 Financial planners: They are usually licensed to deal only in mutual funds 
or guaranteed investment certificates. They may work independently or 
as part of a large chain, and their quality varies greatly. Some are profes-
sional, smart, and dedicated, and some are little more than part-timers 
who can sell you a fund and that’s about it. To deal in funds, they must 
register with the provincial securities commission, but regulation of the 
profession has been patchy. The creation of the Mutual Fund Dealers 
Association of Canada (MFDA) in 2001 has provided a self-regulatory 
framework for fund dealers. It was set up to catch mutual fund dealers 
who “fall through the cracks” with no industry-run body to keep an eye 
on them. The MFDA is affiliated with the IDA and governs all mutual fund 
dealers who aren’t already covered by the IDA or a similar body. It will 
admit members, check that they’re complying with the rules, and publicly 
discipline offenders, imposing fines, suspension, or termination of mem-
bership. Learn more about the MFDA online at www.mfda.ca, or contact 
them at 121 King Street West, Suite 1000, Toronto, ON M5H 3T9.
 
 Insurance agents and brokers: Both will sell you insurance, but a broker 
usually deals with numerous insurance companies while an agent gener-
ally has a relationship with just one. The lines have blurred to an extent 
between financial institutions, due to ownership of fund companies by 
insurance companies and other relationships between the two. As a 
result, some insurance salespeople now are registered to sell mutual 
funds. Moreover, life insurers, which once had a lock on the retirement 
planning market, in some cases have launched their own mutual fund fam-
ilies to hang on to customers’ money. They’ve also made their traditional 
segregated funds more innovative and have spruced up their marketing. 
Seg funds are mutual fund–like products that usually promise to refund 
your invested capital if you hold them long enough (see Chapter 19). In 
general, pick an insurance agent or broker to help you with financial plan-
ning if they are able to sell mutual funds as well as insurance products. If 
the salesperson is limited to insurance, you’re narrowing your options.
The Advantages of Using a Salesperson
We’ve all got hectic lives, so it can be a nice feeling to have someone take us 
by the hand and deal with our investing dilemmas. The stock and bond mar-
kets are confusing, scary places, and millions of people find it reassuring to 
have an ally looking out for them.
Brokers or planners, especially if they’re experienced, will usually know some 
neat tricks and handy shortcuts when it comes to investing. For example, 
they may suggest ways of minimizing your tax liability by setting up a simple 
trust for your children or grandchildren.

131
 Chapter 8: Stockbrokers, Financial Planners, and Advisers Aplenty
 
A good adviser imposes discipline on his or her clients by inducing them to 
save money — and should prevent them from making rash decisions, such as 
selling after the market turns down sharply. Without an arm’s-length person 
imposing some sort of structure on your finances, it’s easy to let debts mount 
up and your money problems drift.
Finding the Right Professional
To fix yourself up with a well-trained and professional planner, make sure he 
or she meets one of the following tests:
 
 Membership in Advocis: This national association and lobby group for 
financial planners, also known as the Financial Advisors Association of 
Canada, had 12,000 members as of early 2008. To join, a planner must 
complete some fairly tough planning courses or have a professional des-
ignation such as Chartered Accountant. The requirement to take courses 
probably discourages complete incompetents from becoming members of 
Advocis. The group has a code of ethics — although no guarantee exists 
you won’t end up with a bad apple — and it imposes follow-up “educa-
tion” on members each year. Contact Advocis at www.advocis.ca or 390 
Queen’s Quay West, Suite 209, Toronto, ON M5V 3A2.
 
 Membership in the Institute of Advanced Financial Planners: The IAFP 
was set up in 2002 by a group of RFPs to promote, as the organization’s 
name suggests, a higher level of financial planning than is promised by 
the FPSC and its presumably more basic CFP designation. The group 
claims its requirements for admission (including the RFP exam) and 
continuing education are more stringent. Contact IAFP at www.iafp.ca or 
P.O. Box 19055, RPO #16, Delta, BC V4L 2P8.
 
 Completion of a recognized industry course: These include courses 
that lead to the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) and Registered 
Financial Planner (RFP) designations. You can confirm that an individual 
has one of these designations by contacting the FPSC or IAFP, respec-
tively; both organizations’ Web sites have look-up tools.
 
 Employment by a chartered bank or by a stockbroker who is a 
member of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada: If the person 
works for a bank, you can be sure of some supervision, although take 
nothing for granted. The banks have set up their own personal finance 
training system, but no guarantee exists the person you get is particu-
larly knowledgeable. If the broker works for an IDA brokerage firm, he 
or she could be incompetent or greedy, but at least you know he or she 
has passed the courses required to become an Investment Adviser, the 
official term that describes an IDA-member broker.

132
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
 
 The core IDA-qualifying course is the Canadian Securities Course, 
which covers an impressive range of investing and industry-related 
information. Members of the public are also welcome to take this 
and other excellent courses offered by the IDA’s educational arm, 
Canadian Securities Institute (CSI). Contact the CSI at www.csi.ca or 
200 Wellington St. West, 15th Floor, Toronto, ON M5V 3C7. The IDA is a 
lobby group and disciplinary body for stockbrokers. If the person who 
wants to sell you mutual funds doesn’t work for an IDA firm, then check 
the Mutual Fund Dealers Association.
 
 Employment by a member of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association 
(MFDA): This provides protection to mutual fund investors similar 
to that offered by its affiliate, the IDA. See the section “Going with a 
commission-paid adviser” in this chapter for MFDA contact information.
 
 In Quebec, membership in the Institut québécois de planification 
financière: Quebec regulates financial planners based in that province, 
requiring an exam and offering its own designation, the Financial Planner 
(F.Pl., or planificateur financier in French). A financial planner practising 
in Quebec also must either have a certificate issued by the Autorité des 
marchés financiers, the Quebec government body that regulates securi-
ties markets in that province, or hold one of several professional desig-
nations. Contact the IQFP at www.iqpf.org or 4 place du Commerce, 
bureau 420, Verdun, QC H3E 1J4.
 
 In British Columbia: A financial planner must be a Certified Financial 
Planner (CFP), or be licensed by one of a number of professional groups 
as laid out by the B.C. Securities Commission.
Unfortunately, you can easily come across bad planners, brokers, and advis-
ers who have impressive qualifications or reputable employers. But at least 
you know that if they’ve gone to the trouble of getting trained, or they’re 
under some kind of supervision from a large organization, you’re less likely to 
be stuck with a complete turkey.
The right way to pick an adviser
Finding an adviser is like picking a building contractor or nanny: Word of 
mouth and your own gut instincts are among the best methods to use. So 
your first move should be to ask friends and relatives what they’ve done and 
whether they’re happy with their advisers. Then go see several candidates. 
Apart from qualifications and membership in a professional association, also 
check out a few more things.

133
 Chapter 8: Stockbrokers, Financial Planners, and Advisers Aplenty
Does the adviser seem curious about you 
and willing to answer questions frankly?
A good adviser will ask you questions about your income, life history, assets, 
financial goals, health, marital status, pension, and investment knowledge. If 
that doesn’t happen, you could be dealing with a sales-driven hotshot who’s 
just looking to make commissions quickly. Shop elsewhere. And ask about 
sales commissions as well as the adviser’s experience and training. Vague 
answers are a bad sign.
Does the adviser work for a firm with an adequate back 
office for client recordkeeping and supervision?
Jargon alert — having an adequate “back office” is just a fancy way of saying 
they are set up to administer clients’ accounts and orders. Ask to see a typi-
cal client statement and ensure that the firm has a compliance officer, an 
employee who keeps an eye on the salespeople and the way they treat clients.
Does the adviser sell a broad range of products?
A planner who wants to talk about funds from just one or two companies is 
probably lazy. Nobody can be familiar with the products from every com-
pany, but you want someone with a good idea of what’s out there. You also 
want an adviser who’s knowledgeable about life insurance, or who can at 
least hook you up with an insurance expert.
Are the adviser’s office, grooming, and general image professional?
Nobody’s looking for Armani or marble halls, but sloppy-looking premises or 
a scruffy appearance are signs of someone who hasn’t been able to attract 
many clients.
Check out Chapter 24 for some tough questions to ask any adviser before 
hiring them. We talk more about warning signs in Chapter 25, which includes 
ten sure signs it’s time for you and your adviser to part ways.
The wrong way to pick an adviser
Unfortunately, a lot of what passes for investor education is just a giant sales 
pitch. So-called “seminars” that purport to enlighten you on a particular topic 
such as preparing a will or taking early retirement are really just a way of get-
ting lots of sales targets into a room. Wandering around a glitzy “exhibition” 
or “forum” for investors may be fun and even informative, but these events 
are also a lure for getting “prospects” — potential customers — into a nice 
concentrated bunch where they can be picked off easily. In fact, be careful 

134
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
about attending seminars if you’re the excitable or gullible type. The colour-
ful celebrity speakers who work the investment circuit are often masters 
of making their audience both greedy and afraid — and easy targets for the 
inevitable sales spiel from the salespeople who paid for the event.
If the phone rings with a broker, adviser, or planner offering to help, decline 
politely and hang up. Always. Such “cold calls” are a time-honoured method 
of drumming up business for brokers. The salesperson calling may be 
perfectly legitimate, but responding to a random phone call out of the blue is 
an awful way of picking someone who’s supposed to help you manage your 
money — such an important aspect of your life.
The telephone is still a favourite tool of those creatures that occasion-
ally crawl out from under the rocks — the dishonest salespeople pushing 
“unlisted” and “over-the-counter” stocks or other “unregistered” investments 
that promise fantastic returns. Do yourself a favour and have some fun. Rent 
two wonderful movies about these crooked sales reptiles: Glengarry Glen 
Ross, based on David Mamet’s play about sleazy real estate marketers, and 
Boiler Room, which tells the tale of some Long Island junk-stock pushers. 
After watching those two great films, you’ll be better equipped to deal with 
telephone sales pitches.
Minding your ABCs — And T’s
Glance down the mutual fund listings and you’ll 
notice that quite a few broker-sold fund families 
market their funds in different classes or series, 
often listed as A or B and even C through F. Not 
to mention I’s and T’s. Alternatively, some, such 
as Guardian Group of Funds, sell funds labelled 
“classic mutual” or “adviser.”
What do these labels mean to you, the potential 
unitholder? In most cases, the difference is in 
the management expense ratio (MER) — the fee 
charged to the fund to cover sales commissions, 
portfolio management, and other management 
costs. In most cases, the MER difference is 
purely due to the type of sales loads (front- or 
back-end). Sometimes it is because inves-
tors in that class of units have paid the sales 
charge themselves or because they bought the 
fund directly from the company, bypassing the 
salesperson. The difference in annual expenses 
is usually between 0.5 percent and 1 percent 
per year. We offer a few examples here:
  AIM Trimark has for years sold its funds in 
two basic versions. Its original funds, such 
as the Trimark Fund SC and the Trimark 
Canadian Fund SC, can be bought only on 
a front-load or “sales charge” basis (hence 
the SC). Its “Select” versions can be bought 
with a back-end load. The back-end load is 
expensive for the company to finance — 
because it must dish out the sales com-
missions to the salespeople itself — so the 
Select funds carry higher expenses. Just 
to make things even more confusing, the 
original SC funds can also be bought with a 
back-end load — and higher expenses for 
the investor.
  Guardian sells its funds in two basic classes, 
classic and mutual. The classic units must 
be bought with a front-end load, whereas 
the mutual units, which carry a higher man-
agement fee, are available with a deferred 
load.

135
 Chapter 8: Stockbrokers, Financial Planners, and Advisers Aplenty
  Several fund companies, including RBC, 
have introduced T-class funds, in which the 
T stands for “tax.” These funds pay distri-
butions to unitholders in the form of return 
of investment capital rather than dividends, 
interest, or capital gains. The latter remain 
within your fund investment, while the 
return on capital is paid out to you tax-free. 
As part of your original investment capital, 
it is not taxable income. 
  Many F-class funds now exist. These have 
very small MERs, as they are sold only 
through advisers who charge management 
fees directly to their clients. In effect, the 
MER represents only the fund’s portfolio 
management fee.
It’s all pretty bewildering, but treating investors 
differently according to how they buy a fund 
is arguably fair. That’s because the front-load 
buyers have saved the company a lot of money 
by paying the load themselves, so they deserve 
a break on the management fee.
If you’re buying a fund that comes in more than 
one class, do everything you can to get the one 
with the lowest management fee, especially if 
you plan to invest for a long time. Sometimes 
even paying a small sales load is a good 
idea — but remember that with a front-load fund 
your adviser often gets a bigger trailer, so don’t 
put up with any whining at the bargaining table. 
Over the years, a difference of only 0.5 percent 
in management fees really adds up. For exam-
ple, say you put $10,000 into a deferred-load 
fund that produced an average annual com-
pound return of 10 percent over a decade: You’d 
end up with $25,937. But say the fund was also 
available in a front-load version with a manage-
ment fee that was 0.5 percentage points lower. 
The fund would be likely to give you an annual 
return of 10.5 percent instead of 10 percent. If 
you managed to buy that version of the fund 
with no sales load, your $10,000 would grow to 
$27,141 — or $1,200 more! Even if you had to 
pay an upfront sales load of 2 percent, reducing 
your initial investment to only $9,800, you would 
still end up with $26,598, or $661 more than an 
investor who chose the rear-load version.

Y
ou may think that being independent is an admirable thing — footloose 
and fancy free, with no strings attached, right? Unfortunately, in the 
mutual fund world, that’s not always the case. Canada’s mutual fund sellers 
are often referred to as being either bank-owned or “independents.” A second, 
important form of fund-seller categorization is load or no-load. Banks’ products 
are no-load, for the most part, meaning they don’t levy sales charges or loads 
to increase your expenses. The independents, on the other hand, almost all sell 
on a load basis. That’s a steep price to pay for independence.
Until fairly recently, independent no-load sellers held a reasonable chunk of 
assets, but bank acquisitions of the two biggest independents in recent years 
have relegated this fund-sales type to a tiny corner of the fund industry. You no 
longer have much to choose from among independent no-load funds in Canada.
So why even bother to seek out an independent no-load fund, you might ask, 
when the banks now have some pretty impressive no-load offerings? (Go to 
Chapter 7 to see what we mean.) Well, the remaining players in this selling 
category are respected money managers who run interesting and innovative 
funds. What’s more, dealing directly with an independent is one of the more 
enjoyable and profitable ways of investing in funds. The company is directly 
answerable to you when you call or e-mail, and you can pull out your money 
with no strings attached if the managers don’t make the fund go up. In this 
chapter, we look at getting rolling with buying direct, go through the pros 
and cons of this style of investing, and take you through a list of the top no-
load players.

138
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
Note that a lot of the advice in this chapter also applies if you’re investing in 
the funds sold by banks or their subsidiaries. In those cases, you also are buying 
no-load funds directly from the “manufacturer.” The missing ingredient — an 
important one — is independence. The independent no-load sellers mentioned 
in this chapter are a unique breed of specialized money managers.
Getting Started with Direct Sellers
Setting yourself up with an independent no-load company is easy:
 
1. Check out the investing philosophy and fund lineups of the indepen-
dent no-load companies on the Internet. You can consult both the 
companies’ own Web sites (which we list in Table 9-1) and third-party 
information sources such as Globefund.com and Morningstar.ca.
 
2. Download the company’s application forms (if available online) and 
then call them to open an account.
Table 9-1 lists the biggest no-load fund companies on the Canadian scene, 
their Web site addresses, and their phone numbers.

No-load fund managers treat you rather like discount brokers do. They have 
an accessible telephone-answering staff that will handle your orders, but they 
don’t know much about you. All you have to do to invest is call their number 
(often toll-free) and transfer some money or send a cheque. Some companies 
have forms on their Web sites that you can download and fill out in advance, 
before you call to set up the account. You won’t face any wheedling, pawing 
salesperson in the shape of a broker, planner, or insurance agent, which 
means you needn’t worry about any fiddly and costly commissions.

139
 Chapter 9: Buying Direct: Six Independents that Sell to the Public
No-load companies are generally fairly big businesses, and they can usually 
be relied on to send pretty reliable statements of your account. Sounds per-
fect, doesn’t it? It is — except you’ll have to put up with a narrow selection 
and a higher minimum investment.
Paying to play
Expect to face stiff minimum investments of $5,000 or more with some com-
panies that sell directly to the public. The fees they charge are low, so they 
can’t afford to fool around with tiny accounts. By contrast, most banks and 
fund companies that sell through advisers let you invest as little as $100.
Direct sellers impose these high minimum purchases because they have 
pretty small mutual fund operations. Their main business is usually manag-
ing money for institutions such as pension funds. These companies are not 
equipped to deal with thousands of unitholders, so to avoid attracting lots of 
small and unprofitable accounts, they often impose the required minimum 
investments.
Take Calgary-based Mawer Investment Management Ltd., for example. It 
sells its no-load funds directly to the public in several provinces, although 
they also can be purchased through salespeople such as financial planners. 
Mawer requires a minimum investment of $5,000 in its funds if acquired 
through an adviser, and $50,000 minimum if bought directly. So an investor 
who wants to buy direct but is just getting started may have to build up a pile 
of cash elsewhere before transferring money to the company.
Considering whether a direct 
seller is right for you
Many Canadians are still in love with their banks and brokers, not indepen-
dent no-load fund companies. They continue to seek out the reassurance of 
a salesperson or the comforting embrace of a giant institution. That means 
no-load direct sellers have yet to really catch on in this country. That said, 
direct sellers are an excellent choice for investors who like to follow their 
investments closely or seek out funds with low costs.
If you can belly up to the bar with the minimum required investment and 
don’t mind the lack of a personal touch, take a good look at this chapter to 
see if you’re really a fit with this type of investing. Direct sellers of no-load 
funds are best suited for:

140
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
 
 Investors looking for simplicity: People who are very keen to get a 
simple solution, with all of their investments on one clear account state-
ment. Direct sellers are easy to deal with because you can simply call 
up and ask questions or make changes to your account without having 
to go through a broker or other adviser. The same advantages apply to 
holding your funds at a bank — but direct sellers are much smaller than 
banks, so they’re easier to talk to.
 
 Savvy market trackers: People who are interested in investing and want 
to follow the process closely. Such savvy investors love the low annual 
expenses and often excellent performance that no-load fund sellers offer. 
Many choose to leave a portion of their money in an account with a direct 
seller while investing the rest elsewhere. People who enjoy watching the 
markets often find that the information given to investors in direct-sold 
funds is more complete — that’s because no-load companies deal directly 
with the investor and see him or her as the customer; fund salespeople 
won’t muddy the picture. And the simplicity of a no-load account held 
at a fund company, instead of through an adviser, makes it easy to move 
money from fund to fund. Active investors who closely track the markets 
often do more switching around.
The Advantages of Dealing with an 
Independent No-Load Company
Using a no-load company that sells to the public is a halfway house between 
the lonely course of picking your own funds at a discount broker on the one 
hand and the comfy warm blanket of getting help from a bank employee or a 
salesperson who earns commissions on the other. When you go to such a sales-
person (the option we deal with in Chapter 8) or a bank (see Chapter 7), you get 
lots of help — but you usually pay for the advice in the form of higher annual 
costs imposed on your fund. And the selection that a bank or commission-paid 
salesperson carries is often limited to only a few dozen funds. At a no-load 
company, the people answering the phone will offer some advice, and the 
expenses on their funds may be low. But the selection of funds on offer is once 
again limited to the company’s own products, and that might be just a handful 
of funds. Discount brokers (Chapter 6), whoopee, have lots of funds on their 
sales lists. They’re the amusement park of funds. But you’ll be riding that roller 
coaster alone, because you’ll get hardly any help.
When you contact any fund company, no matter how it sells its products, 
ignore all of the marketing blather and ask for an application form and pro-
spectus. In many cases, these are available online. Those two usually set out 
the stuff you need to know, such as minimum investment and annual costs. 
You can always slip ’em in the recycling bin later. Or toss them in that old 
rusty oil drum you use to burn garbage. (Don’t the people next door com-
plain about the choking greasy plume of smoke, by the way?)

141
 Chapter 9: Buying Direct: Six Independents that Sell to the Public
If you want a hassle-free solution to buying your mutual funds, going with a 
no-load, direct fund seller offers some important advantages. In this section, 
we discuss the main ones.
Putting more money in your pocket
The biggest plus of buying from a no-load company is the fact that you 
cut out the intermediary. No-load companies can charge you lower fees — 
although they don’t always choose to do so. Because they don’t have to pay 
an army of brokers — or cover the expense of running a sprawling network 
of bank branches — some direct sellers’ domestic equity funds have annual 
expenses of 1.3 percent or less. That’s much cheaper than most domestic 
equity mutual funds, which have total annual costs and fees closer to 2.3 
percent. The more expensive fund is taking an extra 1 percent annually out of 
your mottled hide — over ten years, that difference adds up to 10 percent of 
your money.
If you were to invest $10,000 and earn a tax-free average annual return of 
9 percent for a decade, you’d end up with $23,674. But the same $10,000 
invested at a 10-percent rate of return, because the expenses were one per-
centage point lower, would grow to nearly $26,000 (see Table 9-2). That’s why 
it’s better to have a fund with a significantly lower annual expense ratio.

Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
Offering advice for adults
Another advantage of going directly to a fund company is that you’re treated 
like an adult rather than simply as a faceless consumer of the fund product. 
In other words, the company’s Web site and mailings to investors often are 
more candid about performance. That’s because many of the investors who 
use no-load companies tend to be independent souls who relish the low costs 
and are happy with the lower level of advice. They’re the sort to demand 
complete reporting of performance.
 
If you’re not satisfied with the performance of your no-load funds, or if you 
have queries, it’s simple to just pick up the phone and call. You may not get 
the errant fund manager or a senior executive, but the representative who 
answers the phone will probably be able to give you some answers.
And, best of all, buying no-load doesn’t mean you have to give up getting 
advice altogether. Unlike discount brokerages, for a fee, most direct sellers 
have staff who can advise you on choosing funds and even help you shape 
your overall investment strategy.
Keeping things simple
Dealing with a fund company directly is simpler than buying a fund through 
a salesperson. You’re not forced to relay your order or request via someone 
else, potentially causing confusion or delay. You can call up the company and 
buy and sell funds in your account right over the phone, as well as ask for 
forms or other administrative help. Your relationship as a customer is clearly 
with the fund seller, not with an intermediary like a broker. That’s great for 
you because
 
 You have just one company to deal with and complain to if a mistake 
occurs in your account. Or did you say you enjoyed muttering endlessly 
into voice mail?
 
 You get just one annual and quarterly statement of account.
 
 If you own several funds, it’s handy to be able to check on their perfor-
mance if they’re all included in one company’s mailings.
 
 You can switch money easily from fund to fund as your needs or assets 
change.

143
 Chapter 9: Buying Direct: Six Independents that Sell to the Public
Allowing frequent trades
Moving your money frequently from fund to fund in an attempt to catch 
rising stock markets and avoid falling ones is often tempting. Naturally, fre-
quent traders love using no-load companies because they don’t charge inves-
tors to switch their money in and out. That makes a no-load fund company 
the perfect choice if you fancy yourself someone with the ability to time 
movements in stock and bond prices — for example, every time the Canadian 
stock market goes up 20 percent in a year, you might decide to pull out of 
stocks. But no-load fund companies don’t appreciate it when customers 
move their money around constantly, because it greatly increases the com-
pany’s administration costs (all of those transfers must be accounted for). So 
they’ll eventually crack down on you by limiting your trades. And you’ll often 
get slapped with a charge of 2 percent of your money if you switch out of a 
fund within three months of buying it.
Still, if you want to try to outguess the markets and trade some money 
around every few months (even though it’s often a bad idea), then direct and 
no-load may be the way to go. Here’s why:
 
 The companies have people on staff to move your money from fund to 
fund quickly and easily.
 
 You won’t face any sales charges to complicate the transfer of money or 
add to your costs.
 
 Buying the fund directly from the no-load fund company rather than 
through a discount broker or commission-paid adviser means your sale 
orders go directly into the fund company’s system instead of through a 
discount brokerage employee. That speeds up the process and reduces 
the probability of mistakes in your order.
 
 You get an account statement and transaction confirmation slip in the 
mail directly from the no-load company and not through the discounter. 
That’s simpler and more convenient for investors who are closely track-
ing their own performance.
 
Switching into and out of no-load funds through a discount broker can in fact 
cost you commissions, because discounters often impose small fees of $25 
or more each time you sell a no-load fund. A conventional broker won’t wel-
come your business if you plan to chop and change your portfolio all the time, 
because of all the troublesome paperwork you create. (In fact, if you bring a 
portfolio containing no-load funds to a full-service broker, expect these funds 
to be sold fairly quickly because they pay no fees or commissions.)

144
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
Heavy and constant trading won’t thrill even a no-load fund company. That’s 
because trading raises administrative and mailing costs, which have to be 
paid by other investors. So, with many companies, expect to pay a 2-percent 
penalty when you move money out of a fund within three months of buying 
it. And if you really go over the top, you may be banned from switching your 
money around or limited to a certain number of trades — say, one a month.
No firm rules constitute what counts as heavy trading, but here are a few 
guidelines:
 
 An investor who moves some of his or her money from fund to fund 
twice a year or less would count as a light or infrequent trader.
 
 Someone who made between 2 and 12 trades a year would count as a 
medium trader.
 
 More than a dozen trades a year indicates the investor is a heavy trader 
who thinks he or she can outguess the market.
 
A fund company is unlikely to cut off your buying and selling privileges unless 
you’re trading very frequently — making changes to your portfolio every few 
days or every week. If you do get cut off and you can’t resolve the situation, 
you may have to move your money to a discount broker that allows constant 
trading. But even if you buy through a discounter, the funds you’re buying 
may well levy that 2-percent penalty if you sell a holding that was bought 
fewer than three months ago.
The 2-percent penalty for trading early seems small, but it reduces your 
return. Imagine you invest in the Canadian stock market ahead of an oil 
boom. (As the past few years have reminded us, foreign investors see us as 
resource producers in toques, so they tend to buy into our market when 
prices for commodities, such as lumber, energy, and metals, are going up.) 
Say you put $10,000 into a no-load company’s Canadian equity fund, a fund 
that invests in stocks and shares (which in turn are a tiny slice of ownership 
of companies). The Canadian market goes up 10 percent in two weeks and 
your fund matches the rise in the broad market, boosting your investment to 
$11,000 — at which point you sell half of your holding in the fund, or $5,500. 
If the company slaps a 2-percent fee on investors who leave a fund after less 
than 90 days, then you’ll receive a cheque for just $5,390, which is $5,500 
minus 2 percent. Of course, your other $5,500 is still sitting in the fund.
Knowing when to hold ’em
How many trades are too many? Well, research seems to show that almost any 
level of chopping and changing reduces overall returns because most inves-
tors let emotion distort their judgment, leading them to do things at the wrong 
time. People sell when the market has slumped and is about to bounce back. 
And they buy after it has already shot up and is about to go on the slide.

145
 Chapter 9: Buying Direct: Six Independents that Sell to the Public
Over time, share prices may tend to rise remorselessly as good companies 
thrive and the world economy grows, but the stock market also advances in 
sudden starts. If, following the dictates of your brilliant, can’t-lose trading 
strategy, you happen to have sold your equity funds just before one of those 
days, then you miss out on the profits.
Knowing when to walk away
Moving money out of a fund can be sensible at times, and holding the fund 
directly at a no-load company makes the process easier. Good times to move 
money include when
 
 The fund has gone up so much that it now represents a huge portion of 
your portfolio. For example, if you’ve decided to keep just half of your 
money in shares, but one or more of your equity funds have produced a 
100-percent return over the past year, then you probably have too much 
money riding on equities. Time to sell some of those stock funds.
 
 You’ve been foolhardy enough to bet on a specialty fund that invests in 
just one narrow section of the market, such as South Korea or financial-
services shares, and were lucky enough to score a big profit. Such one-
flavour funds tend to post huge crashes soon after their big wins — as 
investors go cool on the kind of stocks they hold. So think strongly 
about selling at least some of your units in a specialty fund as soon as it 
has a good year. No, don’t just think about it: Pick up the phone and do 
it immediately.
 
 Your reason for holding the fund no longer applies. For example, a 
fund manager you like may have quit, or the fund may have changed its 
investment style.
Check your portfolio once or twice a year, and if it’s out of line with your 
ideal mix of investments, then readjust it by moving money from one fund to 
another. For example, say you’ve decided you want one-third of your $10,000 
mutual fund collection in sure-and-steady government bonds — certificates 
issued by the government that pay interest and can be cashed in again at the 
issue price after a set number of years. The other two-thirds is in lucrative-
but-dangerous stocks, those tiny pieces of ownership in companies. See 
Chapter 5 for more on bonds and stocks.
So your setup is:
$3,300 bond funds 
33 percent of portfolio
$6,700 stock funds 
67 percent of portfolio
$10,000 total portfolio 
100 percent of portfolio

146
Part II: Buying Options: Looking for a Helping Hand 
Say the bonds hold their value over the next year, remaining at $3,300, but 
the stocks rise 30 percent to $8,710, which gives you a mix of:
$3,300 bond funds 
27 percent of portfolio
$8,710 stock funds 
73 percent of portfolio
$12,010 total portfolio 
100 percent of portfolio
This means you have too much riding on the stock market in relation to your 
original plan — almost three-quarters of the total pile. You can fix it easily by 
moving $663 out of stock funds and into bond funds, leaving you with a port-
folio that looks like this:
$3,963 bond funds 
33 percent of portfolio
$8,047 stock funds 
67 percent of portfolio
$12,010 total portfolio 
100 percent of portfolio
If you hold a super-volatile fund that invests in a narrow sector or region, 
such as a technology company or Latin America, it’s a good strategy to move 
some money out of the fund if it shoots up in value. That way, you lock some 
profits before the inevitable crash. Holding such funds forever is of dubious 
benefit because they’re at risk of losing money for long periods, as explained 
in Chapter 12.
Weighing the Drawbacks of Going Direct
Most no-load mutual fund companies offer too few funds to really give you a 
diversified portfolio — that means an account with many different types of 
investment. Here are the main drawbacks to using a direct seller.
Significant levels of cash required
As we mention at the beginning of this chapter, not everyone can go direct. 
As attractive as it seems to investors who are serious minimalists in terms of 
their need for guidance and their interest in paying fees to invest, you need a 
minimum amount of cash to play — in one case, as much as $100,000. This is 
obviously not the case with novice investors, or those in the process of build-
ing their portfolio. Although this type of investing may not be the right choice 
for you now, it is something to keep an eye on as your investing savvy and 
your portfolio grow.

 Chapter 9: Buying Direct: Six Independents that Sell to the Public
Lack of choice
The main problem with direct purchase of funds is the narrow selection. Few 
direct sellers have more than one or two funds, so if you leave all your money 
with one company, you’re at risk of seeing the market turn against that par-
ticular investment style.
A typical no-load fund company sells just a couple of funds of each type. 
Generally, the company will offer the following:
 
 One or two stock funds
 
 One or two bond funds
 
 One or two global equity funds
 
 Perhaps a few specialty funds, such as one that buys only U.S. stocks
That’s a small selection compared to buying from a broker, insurance sales-
person, or financial planner, who can often sell you at least a dozen funds in 
each category. At a discount broker, you can buy hundreds of each.
 
You can avoid this lack-of-choice drawback by buying the direct seller’s funds 
through a discount broker instead, if they’re available. That lets you use the 
no-load seller’s funds, with their nice low expenses, in combination with index 
funds or funds from other companies. However, your discount broker may not 
even carry a low-expense company’s funds (because the discounter gets little 
or nothing in sales commissions).
Doing it through a discounter
Yes, you can often buy no-load mutual funds 
through your full-service broker and discount 
broker, instead of going directly to the fund 
company. But brokers often hit you with a com-
mission or “transaction fee” to let you buy or 
sell low-expense, no-load funds.
That’s because these funds often don’t pay the 
brokers much of anything in ongoing annual 
commissions — known as trailers in the colour-
ful argot of the fund world. But the low costs 
and fees charged to unitholders in many no-
load funds usually make it worthwhile to buy 
them despite the small charge imposed by the 
broker, especially if you plan to hang on to the 
funds for a few years.
Be warned, though: If you buy the funds through 
a broker, discount or full-service, the fund com-
pany probably won’t have any record of your 
investment, so you lose the advantage of being 
able to deal directly with the company.

Direct Sellers’ Struggle in Canada
No-load funds from independent companies are a huge business in the United 
States, with companies such as Janus Capital, T. Rowe Price, and Vanguard 
Group attracting tens of billions of dollars. But Canadians have never really 
fallen in love with the concept.
When Fidelity Investments came to Canada in the 1980s, it eschewed the no-
load approach that brought it great success in the U.S. market; in this coun-
try, it sells only through advisers. Fidelity Canada hardly even looked over its 
shoulder at its parent company’s no-load approach.
Two other U.S. no-load giants, Scudder and Charles Schwab, ventured north 
of the border in the 1990s, but lasted only a few years before crying uncle. 
Scudder came north in 1995, but dismal sales prompted the company to call 
it quits in 1999 when it sold its funds to IG Financial, which soon funneled the 
funds into the Mackenzie Financial lineup. Apparently undaunted by the fail-
ure of its home-market rival, Schwab set up shop here that same year, only to 
throw in the towel less than four years later when it sold out to Scotiabank.
Vanguard, the U.S., no-load, index-fund powerhouse, has taken heed of our 
inhospitable climate, reviewing the possibilities in our market from time to 
time but always deciding against it.
The two homegrown no-load independents to have achieved success in terms 
of amassing significant assets — Phillips, Hager & North and Altamira — were 
summarily gobbled up by big banks. And in mid-2008, Saxon Investment 
Management, a small but highly regarded independent, was gobbled up by 
Investor’s Group’s Mackenzie Financial division.
Sizing Up the Six Independents
Although the remaining independent no-load pickings are slim, they’re still 
well worth a look. This group of six has some interesting funds, many with 
great performance.
 
The problem with buying from these low-cost, no-load sellers is that they 
don’t offer enough funds to give you a truly diversified portfolio. They might 
argue the point, but we can’t help feeling that just one Canadian equity fund or 
one global equity fund isn’t enough to spread your risk adequately — relying 
on a single manager, management team, or style of investing means a fund can 
go into a prolonged and nasty slump.
In this section, we take a look at some of the best known sales policies and 
products from direct no-load sellers.

149
 Chapter 9: Buying Direct: Six Independents that Sell to the Public
Beutel Goodman
The biggest among our group of six independent no-load sellers, Toronto-
based Beutel is a big name in institutional investing. The primary function of 
its 13 funds, as with most of the six, is to provide portfolio management to its 
individual clients.
Its flagship Canadian Equity Fund, a consistent top performer, is known to 
fare better than most during bear markets. Its other big funds, income and 
balanced, also have been strong long-term performers. And 1.19 percent is 
about as cheap as it gets for a balanced fund’s annual expenses. The other 
funds are similarly inexpensive, in the 1.3-percent neighbourhood.
The minimum investment in a Beutel Goodman mutual fund account is 
$10,000. Contact the company to obtain an application form and to set up an 
account.
GBC
This Montreal-based, private-client money manager sells its funds to anyone 
who can handle the $100,000 account minimum. Its six funds serve primar-
ily as portfolio building blocks for its high-net-worth private clients, most of 
whom pay the firm to manage their portfolios. GBC is a specialist in small- to 
medium-capitalized companies — so if you want big blue-chips, go elsewhere.
It has seven funds, the largest being GBC International Growth Fund. It car-
ries Morningstar’s five-star rating, an accolade it managed to retain despite a 
gruesome record in 2007. No matter — GBC’s focus, besides market capital-
ization, is long-term. Although smaller-cap investing can bring instant gratifi-
cation, thanks to volatile stocks of smaller companies it can also bring instant 
disaster — but only if you sell.
The firm has a good reputation for being conservative in the risk-plagued, 
small/mid-cap market. As a no-load independent, its funds’ annual expenses 
are lower than those of the load firms and the banks, although they tend to 
be on the high side when compared with independent direct sellers.
GBC has by far the highest minimum investment requirement: $100,000. 
While that figure might seem exorbitant, it is not excessive for the calibre of 
investor that typically invests in the group-of-seven funds. You can download 
application forms from the firm’s Web site, and set up an account by speak-
ing to a GBC rep over the phone.

Leith Wheeler
The vast majority of Leith Wheeler’s more than $6 billion in assets are man-
aged privately for pension plans, foundations, and high-net-worth people. 
In terms of mutual fund assets, this Vancouver-based company is by far the 
smallest among our group of six. Its five mutual funds have achieved above-
average returns without taking on undue risk.
As a value-style manager, recent markets have not been hospitable. However, 
the firm has hung in with its funds achieving performance close to their cat-
egory medians. Its Canadian Equity Fund had a one-year loss of 0.3 percent 
midway through 2008, but it had a stellar 18.3-percent return over 10 years. 
Its MER is among the lowest in its category, at 1.5 percent.
Minimum investment is $25,000. The funds are available only to residents of 
British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario. You have to 
telephone the company to obtain forms to set up an account.
Mawer
This Calgary-based company’s nine funds are all strong performers. But the 
big star is its World Investment Fund, run by 20-year-veteran Gerald Cooper-
Key. This well-diversified fund always shows up at the top of performance 
lists — and all for annual expenses of 1.46 percent; the median international 
equity fund’s MER is 2.6 percent. Its one-year return at mid-2008 was a 5 per-
cent loss — but that was better than most other funds in the international 
equity category, in which only seven of nearly 300 funds broke even over that 
period. Mawer’s main domestic equity fund has been a middle-of-the-pack 
performer, although it was among the best over 10 years as of mid-2008.
You can buy direct from Mawer only if you live in Alberta, British Columbia, 
Saskatchewan, or Ontario, and the minimum investment is $50,000. Residents 
of these provinces can download an application form from the Web site and 
then complete it with the assistance of a Mawer representative. If you do not 
live in one of those provinces — or if the $50,000 minimum is a problem — 
you must go through a discount broker or full-service dealer, in which case 
the minimum purchase is only $5,000.
McLean Budden
Toronto-based McLean Budden is a big institutional money manager that 
also has a stable of 11 mutual funds. Its biggest fund by far is a U.S. equity 
offering, with an experienced team of managers who have made it a consis-
tent top performer. The fund’s conservative growth strategy has held it back 

151
 Chapter 9: Buying Direct: Six Independents that Sell to the Public
when markets are roaring, but depend on it to outperform when the chips are 
down. It has one of the lowest MERs among U.S. equity funds, at 1.25 percent.
The minimum investment in McLean Budden funds is $10,000. To open an 
account, download the application form from the Web site, complete it, and 
mail it in, and a representative will follow up to complete the process.
Sceptre
This long-established Toronto investment management firm’s biggest fund is 
a small-cap equity offering. Sceptre Equity Growth has produced top returns 
over the long term, although it has been among the many value-oriented 
portfolios to suffer of late. But a 15-year compound annual return of nearly 18 
percent from a small-cap portfolio is mighty enticing. One problem, though: 
That impressive number was largely the work of Allan Jacobs, who left the 
fund in 2007 to join Sprott Asset Management, a high-achieving hedge fund 
manager. However, Jacobs has competent replacements in the form of co-
managers, and fund critics including analysts at Morningstar are confident 
the fund has good fortunes ahead. Sceptre Equity Growth’s MER is a bargain 
at 1.58 percent.
Sceptre’s minimum investment is just $5,000. You can download an account 
application but must telephone the company to set up an account.
Investors Group: A special case
Investors Group Inc. of Winnipeg is Canada’s 
second biggest fund company. It had a huge 
$108 billion in assets as of mid-2008, $3 bil-
lion short of the Royal Bank of Canada. Nearly 
one-third of those assets are held within its 
Mackenzie Financial Corp. subsidiary, which IG 
runs as a separate operation.
Giant Investors Group got to be that size by 
giving about a million investors exactly what 
they want: An all-in-one solution to their finan-
cial planning needs.
The company sells directly to the public, but it 
does so through dedicated salespeople who 
work exclusively for Investors Group. That means 
it is rather like a regular “broker-sold” company, 
such as Mackenzie or Fidelity Investments 
Canada Ltd., that markets its funds via advisers. 
If you buy into an Investors Group fund, you face 
sales commissions, although they’re buried in the 
management fee charged by the fund.
Investors Group is unique on the Canadian scene 
because its army of more than 3,000 salespeople 
is tied to the company. That makes it a hybrid of 
broker-sold fund companies that market through 
independent salespeople and no-load companies 
that sell directly to customers. Investors Group 
representatives are also trained and equipped 
to provide other financial services and products, 
offering a cradle-to-grave, money-management 
plan for the customer.

(continued)
The company levies annual costs that are in line 
with or slightly higher than fund industry aver-
ages. For example, the enormous $13-billion 
Investors Dividend Fund has annual costs of 2.69 
percent, substantially higher than the 2.6 percent 
levied by the median Canadian equity balanced 
fund.
Investors Group funds are generally middle-of-
the-pack performers. Investors Dividend had an 
8.1-percent, five-year, compound annual return 
as of mid-2008, compared with the median 
Canadian equity balanced fund’s 9.4 percent. 
Its category-mate Investors Balanced achieved 
9.1 percent during the same period. Over in the 
Canadian dividend and income equity category, 
Investors Canadian Equity returned 15 percent 
during the period, while Investors Canadian 
Large Cap Value gained 13.6 percent — the same 
as the category median.
The company has a truly bewildering selection of 
offerings. As of mid-2008, it included nearly 900 
different funds and versions of funds on its shelf, 
including its Mackenzie and Counsel subsidiar-
ies. Some of that number includes funds run 
by other mutual fund companies and external 
money management firms — including 22 funds 
sold under the specific Investors brand that are 
managed supposedly externally by Mackenzie! 
But a big gap exists in the lineup: No sign of any 
index funds. That’s because it’s impossible for an 
index fund to be profitable if you’re paying com-
missions to salespeople.
The company’s enormous financial clout and 
partnership with sister company Great-West Life 
Assurance (which itself has more than 100 seg-
regated funds) allow it to offer a wide range of 
non-fund products and services. But dealing with 
Investors Group is essentially the same as buying 
funds from other broker-sold fund companies that 
market through commissioned salespeople — in 
other words, the expenses on its fund are higher 
than those imposed by the cheaper independent 
no-load companies.

E
quity mutual funds, which buy stocks and shares of companies, are 
perhaps the best route to riches you will ever find. Okay, marrying a 
95-year-old, hang-gliding, suicidal millionaire in poor health might be quicker, 
but then you have to fend off all those whining rival heirs. Equity funds are a 
wonderful invention because they hold shares in a huge variety of (usually) 
great companies. So wide is the selection of holdings in most equity funds 
that if some of the businesses fail or stagnate, the fund nearly always has 
enough winners to pull you through.
Equity funds should be the core of just about anybody’s investment portfolio, 
assuming he or she is investing for at least five years. Because the economy 
and well-run companies are almost certain to grow over time, stocks and 
shares can be the engine of growth for your money. If you want to earn 
decent returns on your cash over the long term, and you’ve decided to buy 
mutual funds, you’re pretty well forced to buy equity funds. That’s because 
they’re the only type of fund likely to produce big returns, possibly 8 to 10 
percent or more annually, over the long haul. And those are the types of 
returns you need to defy inflation and build a substantial nest egg.
Yes, the stock market and the funds that invest in it can drop sharply, some-
times for years — we provide some scary examples in this chapter. So make 
sure you have a good chunk of bond funds in your holdings as well. But 
strong evidence exists that equity markets pretty well always rise over peri-
ods of ten years or more, so equity funds are a relatively safe bet for buyers 
who are sure they can hold on for a long time without needing the money 
back at short notice.

156
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
In this chapter we give you a crash course on how the stock market works 
and explain why funds are a great way to profit from it. We show why you’re 
best off buying equity funds that invest in big and stable companies, espe-
cially businesses that sell their wares all over the world. We also make clear 
why it’s a good idea to hold six or seven equity funds — three Canadian and 
three or four global — and we give you simple tips for selecting great funds.
Why Investing in Stocks Is Simple
Believe it or not, making money in the stock market is easy — in theory. You 
just buy shares — tiny slices of ownership — in well-managed companies 
and then hold on to them for years. As the businesses you’ve invested in 
thrive, so do their owners, and that includes you as a shareholder. But when 
you actually try to select wonderful companies, things get complicated. For 
one thing, it’s hard to tell which companies have genuinely bright prospects, 
because the managers of just about every corporation do a great job of blow-
ing their little brass horns and making everything look wonderful in their 
garden. And, like everything else, the stock market is subject to the whims of 
fashion. When investors decide they love a particular company or industry, 
the shares usually go to fantastic heights. At that point, buying stocks turns 
into a risky game — no point buying a great business if you pay four times 
what it’s really worth.
Being fallible human beings, we constantly sabotage ourselves in the stock 
market. When everything is going well and shares are climbing to record 
highs, we feel all warm, fuzzy, and enthusiastic — and we stumble into the 
market just in time for the crash. And when the economy or the stock market 
is slumping, we get all depressed and sell our shares at bargain-basement 
prices — just when we should be grabbing more. But perhaps the biggest 
problem with investors is our innate belief that we’re smarter than every-
body else. Everybody thinks the same thing, which means that lots of us are 
going to end up losers. Don’t let us stop you: You can try to make pots of 
money buying speculative technology companies or penny mining stocks or 
companies consolidating the pallet industry (don’t laugh, Andrew did), but 
that’s really gambling. True investing in stock markets is simply buying well-
established, well-run businesses and holding the shares, ideally for years.
 
Mutual funds are one of the very best and easiest ways to make money from 
the stock market. That’s because they
 
 Are run by professionals who are trained in the art of checking out 
businesses.
 
 Are set up to make it easy to put your money in and get it back out.
 
 Hold a wide variety of companies, spreading your risk and giving you the 
chance to benefit from growth in a huge range of industries.

157
 Chapter 10: Equity Funds: The Road to Riches
By handing your money over to a mutual fund company, you’re saving your-
self from yourself — if you aren’t making the decisions, then you can’t risk 
your savings on wild bets or crazy dreams.
The real kicker in stock market investing is figuring out whether a company 
is genuinely good — a quality outfit worth putting money into — and whether 
the price you’re being asked to pay for shares is too high. Unfortunately, 
though, there may be no such thing as a true value for a company, because 
the numbers all vary so wildly according to the assumptions you make about 
the future. In that case, a stock is simply worth what people decide to pay for 
it on any given day. And that may not be very much: Stocks can dive for no 
apparent reason. But ordinary people saving for the future should care about 
the crazy volatile stock market for one reason: Good companies thrive, their 
profits go up, and their stocks gain value over the long term.
Sometimes selecting a good company to invest in can be almost embarrass-
ingly simple. Take everybody’s favourite telecommunications toy — sorry, 
tool — the BlackBerry. From the day these minuscule but versatile little com-
puters appeared in cellphone company boutiques, they seemed a must-have 
addition to daily life. Innovation, good design, and clever marketing is no 
accident — it requires talented people, and they don’t stay long with badly 
run companies. Sure enough, an investor who bought shares of Research In 
Motion — or RIM, the manufacturer of the BlackBerry — soon after the com-
pany first issued shares to the public in 1999, multiplied their money more 
than twentyfold over the next nine years. That’s a spectacular case, but once 
in a while RIM-like success stories come along.
In for the long haul
 
Based on experience in the past century, you almost always win in the stock 
market over periods of at least ten years provided you stick to big, high-quality 
companies and you spread your risk by owning at least a dozen of them in 
different industries. Most equity mutual funds play it even safer by holding at 
least 50 different stocks (many hold 100 or more) so they can be sure of buying 
and selling their holdings easily.
Remember, too: It’s hard to lose money in the stock market as long as you 
buy well-run, large companies and hold them for long enough. Studies that 
looked at every ten-year period in the market during the 20th century found 
that stocks produced a profit in 99 percent of the periods, although that falls 
to 86 percent if you take inflation into account. So while 20 to 1 might be a 
stretch, with diversification and patience a RIM-like 5 to 1 is doable.

158
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
Why do most mutual funds hold so many different stocks? Why doesn’t the 
manager just buy his or her favourite half-dozen shares and run with that? 
One reason is that when the market turns sour on a company its stock tends 
to drop like a rock. So exposing a huge proportion of your fund to a single 
company is a bad idea. Getting stuck with a stock nobody else wants is a fund 
manager’s most ghastly nightmare. Whenever he or she offers the shares for 
sale, rival investment managers make sympathetic faces and gentle cooing 
noises — and then refuse to buy the garbage at anything but sub-bargain 
prices. To protect investors, under provincial securities law a mutual fund can 
have a maximum of 10 percent of its assets in a single stock. And most funds 
limit their exposure to single shares to 5 percent or less.
A test case for capitalism: 
Meet Angus and Bronwyn
 
Take an equity fund apart and figure out just what it’s made of. The “equity” 
in equity funds is just a fancy word for stocks and shares — two words that 
mean the same thing. Just like stocks, shares are tiny portions of ownership of 
a company, imaginary certificates that represent ownership of the business. 
(Long gone are the days when investors hoarded elaborately printed stock 
certificates in their safety-deposit boxes; it’s all done electronically now.)
Consider a grossly simplified example to see how the stock market works. 
Suppose you and your Welsh sister-in-law Bronwyn start a dry cleaning busi-
ness and you each invest $5,000, while your Scottish boyfriend Angus puts up 
$10,000. That means the store has three shareholders, or owners, and a total 
of four shares: One each for you and Bronwyn (in return for your $5,000 each), 
and two shares for Angus, because he put up twice as much. Now, say people’s 
silk blouses get wrecked and the business doesn’t do well. Bronwyn realizes 
that Angus wants to get out of this mess, even if he has to take a loss. So she 
buys both of his shares at only $3,000 each, giving her ownership of three 
shares, or three-quarters of the business. The important point here is that the 
price of the shares has fallen because the prospects of the business are poor. 
But the fact that Angus sold the shares to Bronwyn has no direct effect on 
the store itself. People are still coming and going, beefing about their spoiled 
clothes, while the stock trading takes place entirely separately — behind the 
scenes, as it were.
A real-life example of equity investing
Now, mutual funds usually aren’t allowed to buy dry cleaning stores (don’t 
laugh, we know some wild-eyed fund managers who probably would if they 
could), because investments in tiny companies are too risky. Instead, they 
trade stocks on the stock market, a vast organized exchange system.

159
 Chapter 10: Equity Funds: The Road to Riches
To see how this works, consider Canada’s now-fallen stock market star Nortel 
Networks Corp., a giant global maker of equipment for sending signals over the 
Internet, phone lines, and just about anything else you care to name. In late 
2000, Nortel had about 3 billion shares — that’s 3,000 times 1 million — out-
standing (that is, in the hands of investors), and they were trading in Toronto 
at about $70 each. That means the stock market placed a value on the com-
pany of about $210 billion — 210,000 times $1 million.
The significant thing in this snapshot, though, was that Nortel shares had 
soared more than threefold over the previous year. Does that mean Nortel’s 
real value had increased by $140 billion in just a year? Probably not, but Nortel 
shares climbed because investors went crazy for technology stocks, sending 
the stock ever higher. In other words, investors kept bidding, or offering high 
prices for Nortel, and as the mania to own the company’s shares grew, the stock 
price continued to rise. But don’t forget that the opposite is true, as Nortel 
investors discovered to their detriment in 2001 and 2002. If investors turn sour 
on a company, the stock normally drops like a dead donkey. During the summer 
and early autumn of 2000, Nortel shares had climbed as high as $122, but they 
slumped to the $70 range by the fall as investors went cool on the Internet.
You might think Nortel was a great value at that point, with the shares down 40 
percent from their peak. Many investors did. Wrong. Nortel just kept dropping 
as the market for telecommunications gear imploded and fears for the com-
pany’s very solvency increased. By summer 2002, the shares had collapsed 
to less than $2, dragging down the whole Canadian stock market with them. 
Nortel since has rebounded and fallen again, so thousands of investors remain 
out of pocket — unless of course they swallowed their losses, bailed out of 
their Nortel investment, and made their money back elsewhere by buying and 
selling other stocks.
“Equity” sounds nice and rich — 
But what does it mean?
The term equity means “fairness” or “equal 
treatment,” and it’s used as a shorthand for 
stock to indicate that each share is as good as 
another (in the real world, controlling share-
holders sometimes run companies for their 
own private benefit, but that’s another story). 
In other words, if a friend owns 100 shares in 
a company and you own 1,000, then you’re sup-
posed to get ten times as much say in choos-
ing the directors and you’re also supposed to 
get ten times as much in dividends — no more 
and no less. Basically, it comes down to who 
picks the directors, because they call the shots. 
“Who cares?” you ask. Well, that little fact — 
the rule that holders of shares get exactly the 
same treatment in proportion to how many they 
own — is one of the great things about the stock 
market. If you hold 100 shares and a mysterious 
Cayman Islands trust owns 1 million, you both 
get exactly the same dividends per share and 
potential increase in share price. The stock 
market is often rigged or brutal, but it’s also a 
very democratic and fair place — you either sell 
or buy, your call, with no sort-ofs or might-dos.

160
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Deciding How Much to 
Bet on Equity Funds
How many of your loonies are you going to dedicate to equity funds? Finding 
the right balance here is critical. As we mention elsewhere, stocks, in the form 
of quality equity funds, are the place for the lion’s share of your long-term sav-
ings. But not everyone has the time or nerve to be a long-term investor.
 
Equity funds are not a good place to hold money you’re going to need in the 
next couple of years. And stocks and equity funds are not suitable investments 
when you can’t afford to suffer any short-term losses. That’s because even 
though stock markets rise over time as the economy expands, share prices 
can go into vicious slumps for a year or more. For example, as of the spring of 
2008, the median global stock market fund had gained 2.9 percent over three 
years. Over five years, it was up more than 7 percent, but up less than 1 per-
cent over ten years.
The median return is the midpoint between the highest and lowest values of 
the members of a group — in this case, a fund category. We refer to median 
returns in this book instead of average returns because they are regarded 
as more useful measures of how well a group of funds have performed as 
a group. A category’s average return is the sum of the returns for all funds 
within the category, divided by the number of funds — thus giving equal 
weighting to each fund, regardless of how big or small it is in terms of assets.
Anyway, back to global equity funds. Despite all the diversification provided 
by a global equity fund, you can’t count on it being there absolutely when-
ever you need it. So the money you allocate to equity funds should be cash 
you can let ride for several years — that way your funds have time to bounce 
back from one of the market’s periodic funks.
Knowing your investment style
In Chapter 4, which is all about using mutual funds in your financial plan, we 
suggest three basic portfolios, depending on what sort of investor you are. 
The allocation of stocks and bonds in these packages is based on profes-
sional portfolios designed by banks and fund companies, but it’s not infal-
lible. That’s because nobody knows what will happen to the world economy 
and interest rates in years to come. And besides, everybody’s different: If 
you have a fat pension from your job, you can afford to take far more risks 
with your mutual fund portfolio in search of higher returns. If the funds lose 
money, at least the regular pension cheque will keep you fed.

 Chapter 10: Equity Funds: The Road to Riches
By contrast, if your mutual funds have to supply all your retirement income, then 
risking the whole wad in equity funds would be reckless. For example, the S&P/
TSX composite index — a collection of Canada’s biggest companies — plunged 
25 percent in 2001–2002. For someone who had his or her entire savings tied up 
in the stock market, that would have been a hair-raising experience.
Investors can logically be divided into three types, each with a very different 
need and desire for equity funds. Chances are you don’t fit neatly into any of 
the categories, but you’ll almost certainly feel closest to one of them:
 
 Savers are people for whom investment losses are either unaccept-
able or unbearable. Typically, a saver is someone who will be using his 
or her money to make a major purchase, such as a home, within the 
next couple of years. So all that savers want is a steady and guaranteed 
return, even if it’s less than 5 percent a year. The group also includes 
people of modest means who will need every penny they’ve saved to live 
on, and thus can’t afford to take any risks. Investors like this probably 
shouldn’t own any equity funds because the risk of loss is just too great.
 
 Balanced investors are like most of us — we just want a steady return 
year after year, without too many stomach-turning drops along the way. 
After all, life plans change, and we may find it necessary to dip into our 
savings long before retirement. Avoiding huge losses means owning lots 
of bonds, which are loans to governments and investors that have been 
packaged into tiny slices so investors can trade them. In Chapter 4, we 
suggest that investors in this balanced group limit equity funds to only 
45 percent of their portfolio. Only 45 percent in stocks is a very cautious 
mixture, but remember that as you chase higher returns your risk of 
loss climbs.
 
 Growth investors are the aggressive or “long-term” types who don’t mind 
double-digit losses in their portfolios as long as they, ideally, earn 10 per-
cent or more over the long term. In other words, they’re investing for at 
least five years. In Chapter 4, we suggest a portfolio for growth investors 
that’s 75 percent in stocks. If you have many years to go before you’ll 
need the money in the portfolio — that is, you can tie the money up for 
a decade or more — then you may be happy putting even more of your 
money into pure stock funds. But before you decide to roll the dice on 
equities with compete abandon, remember that nearly all professional 
investors make sure they own a good dollop of guaranteed investments, 
in the form of cash and government bonds, in the portfolios they run.
Learning from history
 
For most of the second half of the 20th century, no other type of investment 
performed as well as stocks. Real estate went into big slumps. Cash or bonds 
were safer, but they generally pay much less, meaning their returns are often 
wiped out by inflation.

162
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
How good have stocks been in the long run? Well, sorry to give you a weasel-
like answer, but it depends on what period you want to look at. For example, 
consider three recent 10-year periods and then a 20-year span:
 
 1987–1997: U.S. stocks were way ahead of global and Canadian stocks. 
The S&P 500 composite index rose a cumulative 477 percent over this 
ten-year period, more than twice as much as the MSCI world stock index, 
which rose 216 percent. Canadian bonds, measured by the TSX DEX 
universe bond index, outperformed the S&P/TSX composite, 200 percent 
versus 184 percent.
 
 1992–2002: Roll ahead to another ten-year span, and U.S. stocks are 
still well ahead of the pack, up a cumulative 203 percent compared with 
around 135 percent for Canadian stocks and Canadian bonds.
 
 1997–2007: More recently, it’s a very different story. Canadian stocks, 
propelled by an explosion in the price of oil, gained 147 percent during 
this period. A distant second was Canadian bonds, up 84 percent, fol-
lowed by global stocks, up a so-so 41 percent. U.S. stocks trailed badly 
at 23 percent — thanks in large part to Wall Street’s miserable 2007.
 
 1987–2007: Longer term, stocks were the clear winners, with both 
Canadian and U.S. stocks producing cumulative returns in excess of 600 
percent. Global stocks fared fine, too, gaining nearly 350 percent. But 
Canadian bonds, aided more recently by a strong loonie, rose 450 percent.
These numbers demonstrate a couple of vital lessons:
 
 To get really big growth in your money over many years, you almost cer-
tainly have to own at least some stocks — but as the time approaches 
when you need to dip into your savings, sell your equity funds to protect 
against a market slump.
 
 Despite Bay Street’s recent outperformance, you also have to keep lots 
of your money outside Canada and in big global companies to realize 
real long-term growth.
Remember, the time period you choose to compare investment returns can 
make all the difference. Global stock markets made huge gains during the last 
quarter of the 20th century, although a few serious bumps happened along 
the way. The 21st century has started out more tentatively, although markets 
still have made huge gains. As we preach earlier, there will be years or even 
strings of years when the markets will lose you money. In fact, stock markets 
can produce losses over many years, so it’s unwise to risk every penny of 
your retirement savings there.

163
 Chapter 10: Equity Funds: The Road to Riches
 
Investors in the late 1960s and early 1970s saw the entire stock market in the 
United States and Canada stagnate for a decade as inflation and recession 
sapped confidence in the future of equity investing itself. The inflation-racked 
period from 1967 to 1977 presented the worst possible conditions for stocks 
because interest rates that soared above 20 percent simply tempted investors 
to put their money into guaranteed deposits. No mutual fund, and practically 
no type of investment, will be able to get through catastrophic inflationary 
times like those without losing money. However, central bankers seem to have 
figured out how to run the economy without slipping into inflationary spirals. 
Or so it seems.
 
The point of all of these dire warnings about stock declines is that most of the 
people who are running and selling mutual funds don’t remember the grim 
1960s and 1970s either. Many of them hadn’t been born, even. So they’ll often 
spin you a cheerful yarn along the lines of “the stock market always goes up 
over the long term.” Maybe it does, but they won’t be around to refund your 
money if the market goes into a 1970s-style collapse, either. That said, equity 
salespeople had much to chirp about in recent years; the S&P/TSX rolled up 
four straight years of double-digit gains before settling for a modest 9.8 percent 
in 2007. It fell for anyone who made a big bet on U.S. stocks, though. The S&P 
500 composite index, Wall Street’s principal benchmark, achieved much more 
modest gains during that span and then lost more than 10 percent in 2007.
Take a great-grandma out to lunch — And ask 
what deflation was like
The big hope is that inflation remains under 
control, despite volatile markets, and that we 
won’t return to the days of double-digit price 
increases, last seen in the 1960s and 1970s. 
Runaway inflation means money itself is losing 
value at a brisk pace, and that’s scary news 
for investors — who depend on their financial 
assets growing in value, not shrinking.
From 1970 onward we had a recession about 
every ten years that was sparked in part by 
overheating in the economy and the resulting 
inflation. Oil price increases also hurt. But infla-
tion hit only 8 percent during its 1990s bout, and 
as of mid-2002 it was still a benign 2 percent 
or so in Canada and the U.S. In fact, there was 
even talk of deflation — falling prices for goods 
and services because of global oversupply. 
Very few adults alive today have lived through 
that, but the resulting despair and relentless 
contraction in the economy could make infla-
tion look like a walk in the park.
The last time prices fell in Canada in a sus-
tained way was the late 1930s. Lots of people 
had outdoor washrooms then, and lots of kids 
in Canada didn’t get enough to eat. Not a good 
time to own stocks. If you know someone who 
was an adult in the 1930s, take the old girl or 
boy out to lunch. Ask them what they remember 
about falling prices — but also look them in the 
eye and ask them about the poverty and stagna-
tion of those times.

Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Splitting between index and 
actively managed funds
The best plan is to take the money you’ve set aside for equity funds and 
simply buy an index fund that tracks the Canadian stock market, another that 
tracks the U.S. market, and yet another that tracks stock markets in the rest 
of the world. Or you may someday simply be able to buy a Canadian index 
fund and a global index fund that follows markets everywhere, including the 
United States.
 
Put between one-half and two-thirds of your equity money into those two or 
three index funds. Then, with the rest of your stock market money, buy two 
high-quality “normal” or “actively managed” Canadian equity funds and two 
high-quality global stock funds. By normal or actively managed, we mean funds 
whose managers actually buy and sell stocks in pursuit of extra profits — 
instead of, as an index fund does, simply buying every stock in the market and 
giving you returns in line with an index or benchmark, such as the S&P/TSX 
composite index or the MSCI world index. (We offer tips on selecting the best 
actively managed funds in the section “The ABCs of Picking a Fund,” later in 
this chapter.)
Knowing What Return to Expect 
from Your Funds
Should you have confidence in the Canadian stock market to make more 
than 10 percent consistently in the future? Are U.S. stocks sure to return to 
their heady days of the 1990s, when the S&P 500 achieved an astounding 
150 percent cumulative return during the second half of that decade? Can 
you count on 10-percent-plus returns in the future? No, no, and no. And no 
again. (Although yes, you might be able to earn that sort of return over the 
long term if you take big risks in volatile markets, such as during the 1990s 
in Asian markets, which registered huge gains followed by massive losses 
almost in alternating years.)
If you look for about 6 to 8 percent a year, you may achieve your goal by 
buying shares in large and stable companies, but you’re still stuck with a lot 
of your money at risk in the ever-choppy stock market. If you settle for a 4- to 
6-percent annual return, you’re being pretty conservative, meaning you can 
afford to hold less volatile investments such as bonds and cash; only a major 
recession or a triumphant return of the dark forces of inflation are likely to 
give you major losses.

165
 Chapter 10: Equity Funds: The Road to Riches
The ABCs of Picking a Fund
If you’ve been worrying about which equity fund among the 3,000-plus on 
sale in Canada has the best chance of beating the market, forget it. You’re 
better off looking for UFOs in the evening sky (at least you’ll be out in the 
fresh air and you might meet a fellow Space Cadet to start a new life together 
and bring little Star Pups into the world). No point trying to pick a fund that’ll 
beat the market, because only a tiny group of managers are likely to do so 
consistently, based on experience over several decades.
Even if a brochure, ad, or salesperson tells you (or at least implies) a fund 
is the sure road to riches, always make sure you kick the tires yourself. (We 
explain just how to kick those tires later in this section.) The people who 
design and run mutual funds are master marketers and they often sincerely 
believe their fund is a magic lamp that will reliably outperform the market. If 
you go to a broker, financial planner, or insurance agent to buy your funds, 
they too will trot out the same line.
These people are salesmen and saleswomen and, to do a good job, they 
have almost certainly convinced themselves the fund they’re selling you is a 
world-beater. They’ll use reassuring phrases and labels such as “conserva-
tive” or “growth at a reasonable price” to convince you their fund is a way 
to achieve that impossible dream: Big returns at almost no risk. They’ll even 
talk about the fund’s “black box” (a cynical expression used in the invest-
ment industry) in the shape of some impressive-sounding formula or method 
that purports to maximize returns while reducing the danger of losses. Think 
of witch doctors brandishing painted bones and you’ll get the idea. Yes, 
you might get lucky and seize on a manager who outperforms the pack for a 
while, but they always fall to earth.
Of the nearly 800 funds broadly classified as Canadian equity with a five-year 
track record as of June 2008, only 68 managed to beat the 18.2-percent return 
from the S&P/TSX index during that period. It was even worse for the three-
year period, when a paltry 102 among the more than 1,000 funds that had 
been in existence for three years on that date beat the benchmark. And 193 
out of nearly 1,500 funds managed this feat for the one-year period. It’s tough 
to beat the index, apparently.
So instead of using complicated criteria to choose a fund you hope will be a 
world-beater, we recommend that you follow three basic rules, what we call 
the ABCs of selecting a great equity fund:
 
1. Look for a fund that’s full of companies from All industries — and, in the 
case of global funds, All major regions of the world.

166
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
2. Insist that your fund holds lots of big, stable, and conservative 
companies — the type that investors call Blue-chip (because the blue 
chip is traditionally the most valuable in poker).
 
3. Look for a fund that has a habit of producing Consistent returns over the 
years that aren’t out of line with the market or with its rival funds. Later 
in this chapter, we show you how to do that.
Select from all industries
A fund should hold companies from all, or nearly all, major industries, in 
order to spread risk — and to give unitholders a chance to profit if the stock 
market suddenly falls in love with a particular type of company. Here is one 
way to break down the industry groups:
 
 Banks and other financial companies, such as Citigroup, Royal Bank of 
Canada, or Deutsche Bank.
 
 Natural resource processors, such as Imperial Oil, Alcan, or Slocan 
Forest Products.
 
 Technology companies, such as Microsoft, Intel, or Research In Motion; 
cable-TV companies like Shaw Communications also fit in this group 
because they’re battling the phone companies for control of the retail 
telecommunications market, including telephone service, Internet 
access, and television.
 
 Manufacturers of industrial and consumer products, such as drug maker 
Pfizer or General Electric.
 
 Dull but steady utility and pipeline companies such as Alberta power gen-
erator TransAlta or pipeline system TransCanada PipeLines; telephone 
companies such as Telus and AT&T also officially fit into this group.
 
 Retail and consumer service companies such as Canadian Tire and 
Wal-Mart.
Not every group has to be represented in the top holdings of every fund, but 
a portfolio without at least one resource stock, financial services giant, or 
technology player among its biggest ten investments might represent a dan-
gerous gamble. Why? Because of the ever-present chance that share prices 
in that missing sector will suddenly and unpredictably take off, leaving your 
fund in the dust. Avoid funds making bets like that.

167
 Chapter 10: Equity Funds: The Road to Riches
Hold blue-chip winners
Glossy mutual fund brochures often promise the sun, moon, and stars . . . 
but just look at the fund’s top holdings. Whether the fund is Canadian, U.S., 
or international, at least two-thirds of its ten biggest investments should be 
big, blue-chip companies that you or someone you trust has at least heard of. 
A list of the top stocks in any fund is readily available on the Internet — see 
Chapter 21 for details of what the data-company Web sites as well as those of 
individual fund companies offer. Look in the fund’s marketing material or in 
the reports and documents given to unitholders (see Chapter 3). What you’re 
looking for are big and stable firms, the type that offer the best prospect of 
increasing their shareholders’ wealth over the years.
 
Talk is cheap and fund managers love to drone on about how conservative 
they are. But managers of supposedly careful funds can sometimes quietly 
take risks: They put big portions of the fund into weird stuff like resource 
stocks or Latin America to jazz up their returns and attract more investors. 
The list of top holdings is one of the most valuable pieces of information an 
investor has about a fund because it can’t be faked or fudged (ruling out pure 
fraudulent reporting). If you don’t see at least a few giant names — companies 
like Thomson Corp., Bombardier Inc., Coca-Cola Corp., Bank of Montreal, New 
York Times Co., General Motors Corp., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, or Toyota Motor 
Corp. — in the fund’s list of its biggest holdings, then the fund manager may 
be taking undue risks, fooling around with small or obscure companies.
Check out past performance, with caution
After you’ve satisfied the first two of these conditions, look at the fund’s past 
performance. Begin by filtering out funds that have been around for fewer 
than five years, unless it’s quite clear someone with a record you can check 
has been running the money. Then look for consistent returns that aren’t 
too much above or below the market. We all want to make lots of money, so 
leaving past returns until last may seem crazy, and exactly opposite to one’s 
natural inclination. But it’s the way sophisticated professionals do it. If the 
people in charge of a multi-billion-dollar pension fund are interviewing new 
money-management firms, for example, they’ll ask first about the expenses 
and fees the money managers charge and also about the style and method 
the firms use to select stocks and bonds (more on that topic later). Only then 
do the pros examine the past record of the managers — it’s just assumed 
they’ll be near the average.

168
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
Measuring past performance is almost as impossible as determining the true 
value of a company’s stock — it depends entirely on complex and varying 
assumptions and conditions. Here’s an example: Legendary money manager 
Frank Mersch of Altamira Investment Services thrashed his competition for 
most of the early 1990s, playing resource stocks masterfully. He was a jour-
nalist’s delight, always returning phone calls and providing pithy quotes. 
Everybody loved him, especially people with money in his fund. It soared more 
than 30 percent each year from 1990 through 1992, far ahead of the average 
Canadian stock fund. Who could blame you for deciding Mersch was good — 
and for putting money into his fund? But then resource stocks slid when com-
modity prices fell, and Mersch missed out completely on the climb in financial 
stocks, which rose more than 50 percent in 1997 and again in 1998. The market 
and his once-beetle-like rivals left him behind, and by 1999 he had departed as 
manager of the fund. What happened? Did Mersch suddenly become dumb, or 
did the market turn against him through no fault of his own — or was it simply 
that his luck changed? Such questions probably can’t be answered accurately, 
so let’s not bother debating them. But let us repeat, yet again: Betting too heav-
ily on yesterday’s hot performers, hoping they’ll outrun the pack again tomor-
row, is a good way to end up in a dud fund.
Don’t get too hung up about hot results in the past. Mutual fund companies 
like to offer lots of funds so they can have a few big performers to bray about 
in the ads, but those returns are always partly a result of luck. And mutual 
funds, incidentally, are managed more recklessly than pension funds. The 
temptation always exists to jack up the risk and returns a little to get the 
money pouring in. With a pension fund, a manager is expected to stick to a 
certain set of goals and investing style, and the penalties are severe for taking 
unauthorized flyers. That’s because you have a bunch of actuaries, pension 
experts with thin lips and no sense of humour, keeping a watery eye on a pen-
sion fund’s portfolio. But retail investors usually don’t have the knowledge or 
resources to check or worry whether a manager is sticking to the fund’s pre-
scribed style — say, lots of fast-growing companies with high-flying stocks.
Find out what a fund’s past performance has been and, above all, compare 
it with that of rival funds and the market as a whole. The Globe and Mail and 
the National Post used to publish vast monthly reports providing a plethora 
of rate of return data, but no longer do so because the Internet has almost 
completely taken over as the objective source of comparative fund perfor-
mance information. The leading Internet sites for Canadian mutual fund 
investors and investment advisers are Morningstar.ca and Globefund.com. 
Morningstar.ca is run by the Canadian unit of Chicago-based Morningstar, 
Inc., and Globefund.com is part of The Globe and Mail’s substantial Internet 
network, which also includes Globeinvestor.com. (Advisers also rely on desk-
top computer software sold by these organizations.)

169
 Chapter 10: Equity Funds: The Road to Riches
You can find much more on how to use the Internet for fund research in 
Chapter 21, but for now just remember to stick to funds that have been 
around for at least five years. Compare a fund’s numbers against those of 
its peers — those within the same category — and also against the median 
returns for all funds in the category. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more on medians, 
averages, and other performance measures.)
Globefund.com and Morningstar.ca supply the annual compound returns for 
every fund as well as for the average fund in its category and for the market 
as a whole. If you’re interested in a fund, its compound returns should be 
above the average for its group, but if they’re way above — for example, 
an annual return of 15 percent over five years while the average fund made 
less than 10 percent — then the manager is probably a risk-taker. Above all, 
though, be wary of funds whose returns over five and ten years are below 
those of the average fund: Such pooches have a dispiriting habit of continu-
ing to bark and dig holes in the garden.
 
Also check whether the fund has been near the top or bottom in each indi-
vidual calendar year, to detect big swings in performance over time.
Who’s running your fund? Managers on the move
Equity funds offer endless sources of amuse-
ment. One of the fun games you can play with 
a fund is figuring out who exactly is running it. 
This is often so difficult that investors shouldn’t 
get too worried about it when they start buying 
funds. It’s impossible with some companies that 
use a vague “team” to pick stocks. And remem-
ber that a superstar manager is extra likely to go 
cold because he or she gets too much money 
run. Remember that what is actually in the port-
folio is far more important than any amount of 
talk of wizards running your money.
If you get more interested in mutual funds, you’ll 
no doubt start wondering: Why not just put 
my money with guys and gals who have been 
successful in the past? One problem is that man-
agers move around so much. As soon as a stock 
picker builds a strong reputation, all too often he 
or she jumps ship to another fund that offers a 
fat signing bonus. And remember the warning 
that we’ve been repeating endlessly, in a smug 
nasal drone: Star managers invariably fall to 
earth. Sometimes, they go inside themselves and 
sometimes they seem to . . . well, they always go 
inside themselves. Don’t get excited about the 
past history of the manager running your fund. 
And pay even less attention to fawning newspa-
per articles proclaiming them a genius. Just look 
at the fund’s main holdings and its track record. 
If these meet the ABC tests outlined above, then 
it’s probably a high-quality fund.

170
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Avoiding Being Bitten by a Dog
Stocks generally go up over time, as the economy grows and companies 
become more efficient at creating wealth for their owners (which means the 
people who own their shares, remember). Does this mean that any equity 
fund you get your hands on will line your pockets over the long haul? Not so 
fast — for mutual fund buyers, the problem is that individual funds can go 
into long slumps if the fund manager gets it wrong.
Remembering the importance 
of diversification
As a mutual fund buyer, you can really miss out on returns if you’re stuck 
with a hound. We can’t emphasize this point enough: Spread your holdings 
among half a dozen funds — including two or three index funds, funds that 
track the entire stock market, instead of trying to pick individual shares (and 
possibly getting it wrong) — to help ensure they don’t all rot away in some-
thing that never really comes back to life.
 
At all costs, avoid having more than one-third of your money in any one stock 
market fund. That way you won’t expose too much of your capital to a pig of 
a fund. Fund companies and planners might tell you differently, but we really 
can’t think of an exception.
What’s in a name?
A fund’s name may not tell you much about what 
it invests in. Look up the fund online and check 
what category it’s in. You might be surprised to 
see what you assumed was a growth-oriented 
equity fund is actually a conservative balanced 
fund. Or check the top holdings of a global equity 
fund and wonder why it’s missing “U.S. Equity” 
from its name.
If a fund isn’t guided by a responsible-sounding 
name, it in fact might be a volatile fund that’s suit-
able only for aggressive risk-takers or those who 
don’t mind riding out losses. At the very least, 
it will be ignoring important areas of the stock 
market. For example, “international” funds, which 
stay out of the Canadian and U.S. stock markets, 
are intended only for those who already have 
plenty of money invested at home and in the U.S.

171
 Chapter 10: Equity Funds: The Road to Riches
Looking at the big picture 
and knowing when to bail
Fund companies and brokers (with some justification) argue endlessly that 
buying stocks and shares is a long-term game because the market can drop for 
no good reason. (Of course, that doesn’t prevent them from taking out huge 
ads trumpeting their short-term numbers, but we’ll let that go for the moment.)
In fact, an old joke in investing goes like this: Everybody says he’s a long-term 
investor as soon as his stock goes down.
The fund industry says you should ride out losses and that the market always 
turns, meaning you should be happy leaving money in an equity fund for 
at least five years. And the industry advises against selling a fund when it 
becomes a dog, arguing that it’s simply having an off year. Well, perhaps, but 
a fund can take an awfully long time to recover. And it’s impossible to tell 
whether its slump is temporary or long term.
For example, investors in AIC Advantage, a powerhouse fund in the 1990s, have 
not enjoyed the 21st century so far. The fund has a seemingly inbred approach 
to investing: It focuses on the stocks of mutual fund companies. This approach 
served well during the fund’s spectacular 547-percent gain from 1991 through 
1997. Returns have been uneven since then, however, and investors soon grew 
tired of AIC’s pleas for patience and began leaving the fund in droves. The fund 
seemed to break out of its funk in 2006, when it produced a 24-percent return, 
but the bad times resumed in 2007 with a 3-percent loss. Is AIC Advantage now 
a bad fund? Probably not. After all, its mandate clearly states it uses a long-
term, buy-and-hold strategy. As they say: Time will tell.
In some cases, a brief period of bad returns is not the manager’s fault. The 
market just hates the type of companies the manager likes to buy.
Take a look at the ups and downs over the years at AIM Trimark Investments, 
which was Canada’s sixth-biggest mutual fund company in mid-2008 with 
about $38.2 billion in assets.
AIM Trimark’s managers use a distinctive style of picking a few companies 
that they get to know intimately (pipe down there at the back of the hall) and 
hold for years (stop it). Besides, they also often buy lesser-known names. 
That’s all fine — we’ll show you how it has produced big returns — but the 
eccentric style sometimes means the company’s funds go in a different direc-
tion from most others. That’s because most other managers like to thunder 
herd-like into the same globally famous shares. Really, how hard is it to grunt 
“1 million Coke”?

Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
A manager with a distinctive style — as long as it isn’t too, ahem, weird — is 
a great person to invest with. That’s because he or she often makes lots of 
money on a violent turnaround in the market when other managers are losing 
their pricey embroidered shirts. But when the odd stocks the manager likes 
fall out of favour themselves, unitholders in the fund miss out.
Here’s how the up–down syndrome worked with AIM Trimark. The com-
pany’s funds sold their bank stocks in the late 1990s after financial shares 
climbed to record highs because the managers reckoned the shares were 
trading at inflated prices. Turned out they were right — but they sold too 
soon. This, after all, was one of Canada’s biggest fund companies, boast-
ing an excellent long-term record in both Canadian and global equities. But 
the market went against the Trimark team in 1997, and bank stocks went on 
climbing (although they finally slumped in 1999). That meant Trimark under-
performed the broad market and its rivals, and investors pulled more than 
$1 billion out of its funds. The Trimark saga included another humorous pie 
in the face — the fund giant missed out on the upside of the insanity in tech 
stocks. The huge Trimark Fund, normally a nice way to invest in global equi-
ties, made only 6.4 percent in 1998 while most global equity managers were 
up 17 percent or more. But then, for two and a half years straight from 2000 
through summer 2002, Trimark ruled the earth. Its funds, featuring estab-
lished solid companies instead of telecom companies run by head-banging 
greedy executives, took off as the tech scene turned into shabby figures 
huddled around a fire in an oil drum. By mid-2002, Trimark Fund had made 
its unitholders richer by a wondrous 15.4 percent annually over ten years, 
among the best return for any fund of any type at that time.
But perhaps an oil drum — a full one, that is — wasn’t such a bad place to 
be, as Trimark’s managers found out a few years later. The company’s refusal 
to invest in oil companies and other energy stocks has once again sent its 
equity funds into the performance dumpster. Its biggest Canadian equity 
fund, Trimark Canadian Endeavour, was one of the worst one-year perform-
ers in mid-2008 among its 1,400 competitors, with a loss of nearly 30 percent. 
Of course, as we’ve already said ad nauseam, time will tell if Trimark’s hard-
headed consistency will once again pay off. Our bet is that it will, thanks to 
the power of long-term, buy-and-hold equity investing.
The moral of the story: If possible, try to make sure the funds you buy are 
run by managers with a clearly stated style or method of picking stocks. Then 
try to choose managers with different styles. That way, when one manager is 
doing badly the other could be doing well, smoothing out your returns.
But what if your manager, who was good in the past, keeps posting bad 
returns year after year? Unfortunately, no quick answer exists for the ques-
tion of when to dump a good manager. Just follow your gut. And ask a few 
questions if your salesperson seems all puppyish and keen to do a switch. 
She or he could be indirectly getting a cut of 5 percent of the money you 
switch to another firm’s funds because the new firm pays sales commissions.

Heirloom Equity Funds: The Dull 
Stuff that Will Make You Wealthy
In This Chapter
 Deciding how many equity funds you need
 Taking a look at global equity funds
 Checking out Canadian equity funds
T
his is the most important chapter in this book if you’re a long-term 
investor who’s able to commit money to mutual funds for at least five 
years. That’s because equity funds — funds that buy stocks and shares in 
companies — are such powerful investing tools, offering the potential to 
grow your money many times over. If you pick a sensibly varied portfolio of 
high-quality funds, and this chapter will show you how, then you’re almost 
certain to do well as an investor.
We refer to these funds as “heirloom” funds because that’s what they should 
be — treasured possessions you can hang on to indefinitely. Sorry if you find 
these funds a little dull. This chapter isn’t about crazy technology funds that 
soar 80 percent in a year and then crash just as quickly. And it isn’t about find-
ing somewhere safe and predictable to hold the cash you’re saving up for a 
car. It’s about the “core” mutual funds that account for most of your long-term 
money, funds you can buy and hold forever if necessary. Yes, they may have 
bad years, perhaps several in a row, but over time their top-quality stocks and 
varied holdings are almost sure to pay off. In Chapter 10, we outline the basic 
steps you need to take to identify a good equity fund. In this chapter, we pro-
vide more details of the things to check, we suggest some excellent funds, and 
we show you how to select your own mixture of mutual funds.
How Many Equity Funds Do You Need?
Building a great portfolio of mutual funds is simple. All you have to do is 
make two decisions:

174
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
 How much risk you want to take — in other words, how much you want 
riding on equity funds.
 
 How much you like Canada’s long-term economic prospects.
We wish we could tell you to simply buy a single stock market fund, using the 
techniques we suggest, and forget about it. Some salespeople will even insist 
you’re safe with a single wonderful fund. But that course is just too dangerous.
 
Putting all your money into just one equity fund, even if it’s a great one, 
can lead to periods of harrowing underperformance if that fund goes into a 
slump — and nearly all funds do from time to time. Consider, for example, the 
fate of investors in Trimark Select Growth Fund, which in mid-2008 was AIM 
Trimark’s biggest fund with $3.7 billion in assets. The fund, which gave inves-
tors a glittering return of 8.5 percent annually from its launch in May 1989 to 
the middle of 2008, might have done even better had it not been for a cata-
strophic 2007. The fund lost 16 percent, as it was hit harder than many other 
global equity funds by a rapidly rising Canadian dollar. It was Trimark Select 
Growth’s first negative year since 1990, when the young fund lost 7.2 percent 
in a year when almost all of its peers also were firmly in the red.
 
Own more than one equity fund. That way, if one of your funds sags, you have 
a shot at doing well with the others.
But how many funds should you buy to ensure you’ve assembled an ade-
quately varied collection? Before we answer that, look at the only two types 
of funds to consider for your serious long-term money:
 
 Global equity funds buy stocks and shares everywhere, from Taiwan to 
Tupelo. In practice, they usually end up investing in large companies in the 
rich economies of the world because, to paraphrase the bank robber, that’s 
where the money is. In other words, giant corporations have proven to be 
just about the most profitable and most stable investments you can make.
 
 Canadian equity funds, not surprisingly, buy Canadian stocks. A 
number of individual categories exist under the Canadian equity 
umbrella. Some funds concentrate on the very largest corporations, 
such as the big banks or other blue-chip companies like communications 
giant Telus Corp., and others are more specialized, such as small-cap 
funds, which buy only smaller companies with supposedly bigger growth 
prospects. In practice, Canadian equity funds end up holding pretty well 
the same companies because the Canadian market offers a limited selec-
tion, although it offers a little more variety among small-cap funds.

175
 Chapter 11: Heirloom Equity Funds: The Dull Stuff that Will Make You Wealthy
Ruling out specialty funds
In Chapter 12, we look at the host of dancing unicorns and dogs in tutus the 
fund industry has come up with to entice money from investors. By that we 
mean the “specialty” or “regional” equity funds that hold only a certain type 
of shares or shares in only some countries, the idea being that a concen-
trated fund will produce huge profits when share prices in that particular 
industry or part of the world take off like little rockets.
These riskier funds include technology funds, small-company funds, developing-
country funds, resource funds, U.S. equity funds, and Asian funds. Some have 
produced great returns and many hold excellent stocks. But they all suffer from 
one insurmountable handicap: Because they can invest in only a small section 
of the world’s stock markets, they don’t give you the variety and stability your 
long-term money requires.
 
So, the only two types of funds you truly need for the portion of your money 
you’ve decided to have in equity funds are global equity funds and Canadian 
equity/large-cap equity funds. Go ahead and buy some of the risky specialty 
and regional funds if you must, but limit them to just 10 percent of your total 
portfolio. No hard-and-fast rule applies here, but that’s the advice you’ll get 
from many pros.
Deciding how much to 
put into equity funds
 
In Chapters 4 and 10, which deal with using equity mutual funds in your finan-
cial plan, we state that all of us as investors fall into one of these three groups:
 
 Savers, who need to use their money in the next couple of years, 
shouldn’t own any equity funds. The risk of loss in the short term is too 
great, so savers should just buy investments that pay regular interest.
 
 Balanced investors, who want only modest drops in the value of their 
funds in any one year, often put 45 percent or slightly more (up to about 
60 percent) into equity funds. With the rest they buy bond funds, which 
invest in loans to governments and corporations, leaving a small portion 
of their money sitting in cash or cash-like investments. Or they buy spe-
cial balanced funds, which consist of a mixture of stocks and bonds.
 
 Growth investors, who want the maximum return on their money and 
plan to let it ride the ups and downs of funds for five years or more, often 
put about 75 percent of their money into equity funds. If you’re investing 
for periods of ten years or more, and definitely don’t mind big slumps in 
the value of your mutual fund portfolio along the way, you might want to 
put even more into the stock market with its allure of higher returns.

176
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Dividing your money between Canadian 
and foreign equity funds
Should you be patriotic and keep your money in Canada, or look abroad for 
your investments? No definite answer exists, but the prevailing advice has 
been to keep the majority of your stock market money outside Canada. The 
world offers many wonderful opportunities and the Canadian stock market 
represents a tiny fraction of the world’s overall stock market value. For exam-
ple, few Canadian companies have the might of Japan’s Sony Corp., Royal 
Dutch Shell of the Netherlands, or U.S.-based Microsoft Corp.
However, most experts would also advise keeping at least some of your money 
in Canada if you plan to go on living in this country, because you’ll need to have 
assets in Canadian dollars to pay for your expenses here. Plus our market has 
fared pretty well during the past decade or so. But if you’re convinced that 
Canada’s in trouble, then you may want to move 80 percent or more of your 
mutual fund money, including equity funds, into non-Canadian stocks and bonds.
How do you split your money 
among equity funds?
In Chapter 4 we describe a method of dividing your money among equity 
funds. Put one-half to two-thirds of your stock market money into index funds 
or exchange-traded funds, funds that simply track the entire market at low cost 
to the investor instead of trying to pick the stocks that will go up the most. For 
much more on index funds and ETFs, check out Chapter 15. Their reliability 
and low expenses make them one of the very best deals out there for investors.
Canadian stock market index funds and ETFs track the Standard & Poor’s/
Toronto Stock Exchange composite index or the S&P/TSX 60 index (a more 
focused collection of the biggest companies listed on the TSX). Global index 
funds are rare, so you usually have to buy a combo: a U.S. index fund, such as 
one that gives you the same return each year as the giant U.S. companies that 
make up the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, and an international index 
fund that tracks all the major global markets except for the United States and 
Canada. Put a U.S. index fund and an international index fund together, and 
you’ve got a pretty good global equity index fund. So all you need to buy is a 
Canadian, a U.S., and an international index fund.
 
Two categories of funds invest broadly in foreign stock markets:
 
 Global equity
 
 International equity

177
 Chapter 11: Heirloom Equity Funds: The Dull Stuff that Will Make You Wealthy
Here’s the difference. Global equity funds are free to invest anywhere, includ-
ing the United States, but international equity funds stay outside Canada and 
the United States. The idea behind international funds is that many investors 
already have plenty of money in the States by owning stocks or other funds, 
so some fund companies offer funds that stay out of the U.S. market. That’s 
logical thinking, but in keeping with the ABC rules, we believe that when 
picking your non-Canadian stock funds you’re better off sticking with a fund 
that’s free to go anywhere the manager anticipates getting the best return.
With the rest of your equity fund money, buy just four equity funds — two 
global and two Canadian — that have a person or team trying to select win-
ning shares. Those are called actively managed funds because they buy 
and sell holdings in an attempt to beat the market and other fund managers 
instead of just trying to keep up with a market benchmark. The managers, in 
other words, are trying to pick the few stocks that go up the most.
Often, though, managers fail. But at least if you buy a few actively managed 
funds as well as index funds, you have a portfolio that isn’t tied to just one 
market benchmark. It has enough variety to ensure that at least one of your 
funds is probably doing relatively well, even if the others are sagging — as 
long as the whole stock market isn’t crashing. In the event of a wholesale 
decline in stocks, just about all equity funds — both Canadian and global — 
will be losers anyway.
Global Equity Funds: Meet Faraway 
People and Exploit Them
Global equities are the Boeing 747s of the mutual fund world, huge magic 
carpets that offer the best chance of steady, high returns on your savings 
over many years. They should make up about two-thirds of the money you’re 
putting into the stock market — unless you’re convinced the Canadian stock 
market’s out-performance is a long-term event.
Global equity funds have earned steady, attractive returns over the years, 
which makes them the very best type of fund to own. Put most of your money 
here because
 
 They tend to own multinational blue-chip companies, the best growth 
asset of all.
 
 They invest all over the world, spreading your risk and smoothing out 
your ups and downs — when one country is up, another is often down.
 
 The executives running multinational corporations sometimes foul up 
(remember “new Coke”?), but the companies are usually large enough 
and sufficiently sophisticated to recover from errors.

178
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
 Your mutual fund company is just one of dozens of big international 
money managers owning shares in these firms — between them, all 
those sharp lassies wearing Prada and those lads in Armani keep an eye 
on the companies. When their hangovers aren’t too bad, that is.
Many of Canada’s biggest mutual funds fall into the global equity class, and 
some large ones have produced excellent results over the years. Global 
equity funds are hugely profitable for the companies that run them, so the 
managers are intensely motivated not to let the performance slip too much. 
Most global equity funds hold high-quality, blue-chip companies and they 
spread their risk over numerous industries and countries, so they also meet 
our ABC test.
 
Buy at least two global equity funds, because an individual fund can go into 
a slump for a year or more. Different managers are hot and cold at different 
times.
Applying the ABC rules to 
your global equity funds
Be sure to apply the ABC rules we describe in Chapter 10 when selecting a 
global equity fund:
 
 Make sure the fund invests in All industries and Anywhere in the world. 
All of the important economic regions (that is, North America, Europe, 
and Asia) should show up in the top-ten holdings.
 
 Insist on Blue-chip companies, some of which you’ve at least heard of.
 
 Demand Consistent performance that isn’t wildly out of line with the 
other funds in the group.
Investors who just go to a bank branch to buy their funds or who deal with 
another company that sells funds directly to the public will have a problem: 
The bank or company may offer just one suitable global equity fund. And you 
may not be able to buy index funds. No easy way around this problem exists. 
If you can’t or don’t want to go somewhere with a wider selection of funds, 
just buy the global fund with half of the money you’ve earmarked for global 
stocks and then hedge your bets by putting the rest into one or two narrower 
funds that invest in a single region, such as Europe or Asia.
 
Check any global equity fund you buy to make sure it offers plenty of variety. If 
the top holdings contain no European stocks, for example, or they seem to be 
all technology companies, then look elsewhere.

179
 Chapter 11: Heirloom Equity Funds: The Dull Stuff that Will Make You Wealthy
Checking out three global equity winners
 
Here are three conservative and well-run global equity funds that 
Morningstar’s analysts see as good bets in today’s increasingly challenging 
global marketplace:
 
 Mackenzie Ivy Foreign Equity is a well-known global fund run by a 
well-known manager, Jerry Javasky. Global investing means diversifica-
tion and long-term gains, and this fund is a good bet to deliver just that. 
True, the past few years have not been kind to this fund, thanks to out-
performance of specific sectors, prompting some investors to take their 
global investing business elsewhere. But Javasky is an industry veteran 
who has produced excellent long-term results. And although his fund 
typically underperforms in hot markets, it usually outperforms on the 
downside. If you’re patient, chances are you’ll be well rewarded over the 
long haul in this fund. This fund’s annual expenses are slightly higher 
than the category median, but the cost might be justified.
Investment styles: Bargain hunter 
or Champagne Charlie?
The following is detailed stuff that’s likely to 
interest only investors who enjoy peering into 
mutual funds. It talks about the different styles 
of investing that managers use. You really don’t 
need to know about this if you simply remem-
ber to buy two or three funds. That way, when 
one manager’s style isn’t working, you’ll prob-
ably have money with another manager who’s 
having a better year.
Value investors like stocks that are out of favour 
with the market, maybe because the company, 
its country of origin, or its industry has run into 
a temporary setback. So they look for shares 
that are a good value and are trading at cheap 
prices, and they hope to hold them until the 
shares bounce back.
Growth investors argue that the real way to 
make money in the market is by buying busi-
nesses that are already doing well, so they con-
centrate on buying shares in companies whose 
sales and profits are growing fast, even if their 
shares have already gone up. Growth investors 
believe that so-called value shares are cheap 
for a reason, because the company is a pooch.
No evidence shows that one style is supe-
rior. Until the mid-1990s, value managers had 
the upper hand, posting stronger long-term 
returns. Then soaring technology and telecom 
stocks — just the sort of shares that value man-
agers hate — brought growth stocks into fash-
ion until those sectors collapsed in 2001–2002.

180
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
 PH&N Global Equity is a good fund from longtime, no-load specialist 
Phillips, Hager & North. As a value fund, it hasn’t fared well in recent 
years. But it has a reputation of avoiding large losses when markets tank. 
For example, the fund has been spared some downside by the reluctance 
of its managers to invest in financial markets, thus escaping some of the 
losses brought on by the credit crisis. However, its mandate requires it 
to not deviate too far from sector weightings of its benchmark, the MSCI 
World Index. The fund is among the least expensive global equity funds, 
with annual expenses of just 1.56 percent — nearly a full percentage point 
below that of the median global equity mutual fund.
 
 Mutual Discovery, offered by Franklin Templeton, is a go-anywhere global 
equity fund run by experienced value managers. Unlike many value funds, 
it has done quite well in recent years, due to broad diversification through 
more than 100 individual stock holdings. Its performance also has been 
helped by its ability to invest in bonds of troubled companies — invest-
ments that can offer the opportunity for high returns and whose prices 
often behave a lot like those of stocks. The fund also will move well into 
cash if stocks or high-yield bonds aren’t to the managers’ liking.
Canadian Equity Funds: Making 
Maple-Syrup-Flavoured Money
As we explain in Chapter 10, your first move when picking Canadian equity 
funds for the core of your portfolio is to make sure they’re classified in one of 
the Canadian equity categories. These include:
 
 Canadian equity: These funds must have 90 percent of their holdings 
in Canadian-based companies; the fund’s average market capitalization 
must be more than $3.8 billion (for 2008).
 
 Canadian focused equity: The criteria are identical to the Canadian 
equity category, except funds need be only 50 percent or more in 
Canada.
 
 Canadian small/mid-cap equity: These funds must be 90 percent in 
Canadian stocks with an average market cap below $3.8 billion (again, 
for 2008).
 
 Canadian focused small/mid-cap equity: The same as Canadian small/
mid-cap equity, except funds need be only 50 percent or more in 
Canada.
 
 Canadian dividend and income equity: These funds must have a stated 
mandate to invest primarily in income-generating securities, and 90 per-
cent of their equity holdings must be Canadian. The average market cap 
must be above $3.8 billion.

181
 Chapter 11: Heirloom Equity Funds: The Dull Stuff that Will Make You Wealthy
 
 Canadian income trust equity: These must keep at least 90 percent of 
their equity holdings in income trust securities issued by Canadian enti-
ties (we talk about income trusts in Chapter 5).
 
If the company where you hold your mutual fund account offers only one con-
ventional actively managed Canadian stock fund, then use it for half of your 
Canadian stock money and put the rest into a Canadian index fund. If no index 
fund is available (and one should be), then open an account elsewhere for at 
least part of your money.
Keep it simple and don’t worry about which equity fund manager is going 
to thrash the competition, because such an outcome is impossible — or at 
least very, very difficult — to predict. Canada’s tiny stock market, which 
accounts for just 3 percent of the world’s publicly traded shares, offers a lim-
ited number of companies. In fact, for a big-company fund, only a few suitable 
names exist outside of the S&P/TSX 60 index. So most Canadian equity funds 
tend to be pretty similar.
Applying the ABC rules to your 
Canadian equity funds
Applying the ABC rules when you buy Canadian equity funds is simple:
 
 Check that the fund invests in All of Canada’s major industrial sectors, 
including technology, natural resources, and financial services.
 
 Make sure that most of the top-ten holdings are Blue-chip companies 
that you’ve at least heard of.
 
 Demand Consistent performance that doesn’t lag or wildly outpace the 
other Canadian equity funds.
Looking at three winners 
in Canadian equities
 
Here are three Canadian equity funds selected by Morningstar analysts on the 
basis of solid long-term performance and strong fund managers:
 
 Mawer Canadian Equity is a solid offering from an innovative and inde-
pendent no-load company. Its annual expenses of 1.24 percent make it 
one of the least expensive Canadian equity funds. Manager Jim Hall has 
a knack for limiting losses, which has helped the fund produce solid 
long-term results. It’s a great choice as a conservative core Canadian 
equity fund around which to build a portfolio. The manager’s wary 
approach steered the fund clear of investing in CIBC, which suffered 

182
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
mightily from the credit crisis. On the other hand, his avoidance of the 
resources sector caused it to miss out on recent big gains. The manager 
is down on these companies because they are too susceptible to cyclical 
volatility. So if you see resource stocks as being forever strong, it might 
not be your cup of tea.
 
 Saxon Stock has experienced recent struggles in a growth/momentum 
market environment, but its managers, Richard Howson and Suzann 
Pennington, have continued to stay true to the fund’s value-investing 
philosophy. Their investment approach has produced one of the best 
track records in the category over the long run. Risk management is 
a major focus and the fund is well diversified in terms of both sectors 
and individual stocks. With annual expenses of just 1.86 percent, it is 
one of the least expensive Canadian equity funds — thanks in part to its 
low portfolio turnover rate of about 12 percent. The combination of low 
expenses and experienced management — Howson has been in charge 
for nearly two decades — makes this fund a solid long-term bet.
 
 Brandes Sionna Canadian Equity has the advantage of being run by Kim 
Shannon, widely recognized as one of the top Canadian value managers. 
Her relative value approach to investing has produced a mandate with 
an excellent track record (mostly with her previous fund, CI Canadian 
Investment) and has historically fared well during most market condi-
tions. The fund is relatively conservative and may lag the market over 
shorter periods. Shannon typically keeps her portfolio’s sector weights 
fairly close to those of the index, although she does have the flexibility 
to deviate substantially. She completely escaped the tech stock collapse, 
despite those stocks’ heavy weighting in the benchmark index. The fund 
remains underweight in this sector. All this comes at a price, though; the 
fund’s annual expenses are 2.49 percent, well above the category median.
Beware of overwhelming hype
An incredible amount of hype and hot air sur-
round the people running equity funds. Fund 
companies take the managers on cross-country 
tours as though they were rock stars. But ignore 
all the sound and fury.
The people who sell equity funds make a lot 
of noise about them because this product is 
their bread and butter as well as their caviar 
and champagne and bloated drunken evenings 
(actually, they’re quite a sober lot nowadays). A 
good Canadian equity fund is a fund company’s 
showpiece asset, drumming up business across 
the board. The six Canadian equity categories 
account for about one-quarter of the industry’s 
total assets, or nearly $178 billion. Canadian 
equity funds generate a tidal wave of fees — 
about $4 billion per year — for the people who 
run and sell them.

Trips You Don’t Need

 Playing the dangerous game of sector funds
W
e know it’s boring and glib, but it’s also true: Slow and steady really 
does win the equity fund race. In other words, you’ll almost certainly 
do best over the long haul with the conservative equity funds we describe in 
Chapter 11, the ones that buy established companies in all industries and in 
all parts of the world. But you’re only human, and the temptation to chase 
the really hot returns always exists. It wasn’t that long ago — 1999 — that 
the median science and technology mutual fund gained 100 percent. Well, 
help yourself — but get ready to be bitten. Those funds went on to lose 108 
percent of their value over the following three years. Mutual funds are a 
wonderfully convenient and relatively cheap way of playing, say, the Chinese 
market. But with this type of narrow investing, focusing on specific areas like 
small/mid-cap stocks, an individual geographic region, or a particular indus-
try sector is essentially gambling. In a nutshell, it’s probably a waste of time 
because of what Nobel Prize–winning economists call “rational expectations.”
Crudely put, here’s how the theory applies to these specialty funds. By the 
time you realize something might be a good investment, everyone else — or 
at least everyone who matters — will have cottoned on to it too. By the time 
you decide that telecommunications is the fuel of the future and load up on 
a telecom fund, professional investors all over the world have concluded 
the same thing and have already bid telecom stocks up to high prices. Yes, 
you might do well in a technology fund — just ask anyone who invested 
in Northwest Specialty Innovations in mid-2003. After five years, they had 
enjoyed a 16-percent compound annual return. But we’re really talking about 
slot machines here, and the flood of coins dries up eventually. Someone who 
had owned only that fund for a year would lose 8.5 percent as of mid-2008.

184
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Still, hope springs eternal and all that . . . so here’s a roundup of the more 
dangerous types of funds. In this chapter we refrain from suggesting can-
didates when it comes to these wild funds because returns from this gang 
are largely a matter of luck — a manager looks like a genius when his or her 
favourite type of company or market is in favour, and a loser when that type 
of investment goes out of fashion.
Small and Mid-Sized Company 
Funds: Spotty Little Fellows
On the face of it, funds in the Canadian small/mid-cap equity category look 
mighty enticing. The median Canadian small/mid-cap equity fund had pro-
duced an impressive 20-year compound annual return of 10.5 percent as of 
mid-2008. But these funds have benefitted enormously from the success of 
the Canadian resource industry, in which much of the big money is made 
when a small resource player strikes it rich. Actually attaining that return, 
though, is entirely another matter. Small/mid-cap equity funds are a volatile 
bunch of funds.
Hitting highs and lows
If you had bought Northwest Specialty Equity in mid-1988 and still owned it 20 
years later, you would have been bragging about owning the top-performing 
Canadian small/mid-cap fund. The fund achieved an impressive 16.5-percent 
compound annual return over that period. But “if” is the operative term 
here. Even more impressive than your profit — more than $213,000 if you’d 
invested $10,000 back then — would have been your staying power. You’d 
have weathered some pretty big swings during the early going, including the 
14.5-percent loss in 1990 that followed a 27-percent gain the previous year. Or 
how about rolling to an astounding 103-percent return in 1993 and then being 
handed a 6.7-percent loss the very next year? Most investors would have fig-
ured, absolutely, that a triple-digit return was completely too good to be true 
and sell out. But then they would have missed a rebound of nearly 100 percent 
in the next two years.
Who’s to know, though? The important thing to note here is that, had you 
taken the much, much safer middle ground and invested in large-cap Canadian 
equity funds, you’d have done almost as well. The median fund in the Canadian 
equity category achieved a 9.3-percent compound annual return over those 
same 20 years. (We’re focusing on Canadian funds here because relatively few 
U.S. and global small-cap funds exist. And, for the record, these funds have 
fared nowhere near as well as their Canadian counterparts.)

 Chapter 12: Las Vegas–Style Equity Funds: Trips You Don’t Need
Picking a winning fund
Long before you worry about having the nerve to stick with a winning small-
cap fund, the first challenge is to pick that fund in the first place. The prob-
lem is similar to what confronts the guy who’s investing directly in small-cap 
stocks. Guessing which ones are going to “pop” — market talk for getting 
their stocks to go up — is a tough game. But never fear; investors have a 
willing ally in the executives and main shareholders of a company. In fact, 
they’re sometimes only too happy for their share price to shoot up. Cling! — 
is that an option bulb lighting up? (Options are shares that company manage-
ment can buy at a fixed low price — and that become nicer and nicer to have 
when the market price of the shares goes up.) But what’s left in a hot stock 
for everybody else after the corporate management and the investment bank-
ers have torn off their giant hunk often wouldn’t fill a small McDonald’s pop 
cup that’s been lying for days on the ground beside a gasoline pump.
First, a vital bit of terminology — a company’s stock market capitalization 
is the value in money terms that investors are applying to the business. For 
example, a company with 50 million shares in the hands of its shareholders 
and a stock price of $5 has a market value, or “market cap,” of only $250 million 
(or 50 million shares times $5), which still makes it quite a small company.
 
The three most important things to remember about investing in small and 
medium-sized companies are that:
 
 Shares in small companies move in their own strange cycles, sometimes 
sliding when blue-chip stocks go up, which can make them a sort of 
insurance policy for a portfolio.
 
 And yes, when they’re hot, small caps can produce rich returns. Of all 
the wacky fund categories, small-cap funds can best justify their exis-
tence. But you don’t really need them, either.
 
 Small-company funds can go into long slumps, leaving you with “dead 
money” that just stagnates — or, worse, saddles you with heavy losses. 
Most people are better off putting their savings into regular equity funds 
that buy big companies, a strategy that offers steadier returns.
Understanding the disadvantages
 
Take any recommendation to buy a small-cap fund with a hefty dose of salt. 
These are volatile investments best suited to investors who keep a close 
eye on their holdings. Unpredictable rallies and collapses are the way that 
small-cap stocks work. Yes, Canadian small/mid-cap funds have put together 
a string of consecutive gains in recent years. But over the longer haul, most 
investors have had to wait through lean and hungry years for the good times, 
and disappointments are all too frequent.

186
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
So remember that small-company funds are marked by moves upward that 
happen only too rarely, a disadvantage that makes them unsuitable for much 
of your serious money. The numbers show that small-cap stocks may have 
their good long-term record only because of periodic crazy bull markets in 
small-company shares — typically at the end of a great period in the stock 
market, when investors feel clever and brave enough to start chasing riskier 
stuff. Investors in small-cap funds didn’t get any compensatory extra return 
as a reward for taking on the risk of buying into smaller companies.
 
If you insist on buying small-company funds, buy at least two or three. That’s 
because the managers of small-cap funds tend to be eccentric individuals who 
love poring over obscure little businesses and developing their own methods. 
It’s very personality-driven. Even an excellent manager can do terribly if his 
or her favourite type of stock is out of fashion. And don’t forget that the small-
cap sector has plenty of walking dead.
Regional Equity Funds: Welcome to 
Bangkok — Or Hong Kong?
Funds that invest in limited areas of the world may sound like they’re a good 
way to speculate. After all, the median emerging markets fund had a five-year 
compound annual return of about 20 percent as of mid-2008. Regional funds 
are exciting investments, however, and that brings both the good and the 
bad. Although emerging markets mutual funds somehow produced double-
digit returns during each of the five calendar years through 2007, before that 
investors had a pretty uneven ride. Uneven as in a 19-percent loss in 1998, a 
61-percent gain in 1999, and a 27-percent loss in 2000.
 
Funds that specialize in a particular area suffer from the curse of all narrow 
investments, whether they invest in European, Asian, or emerging markets, 
or in individual countries. These markets usually go into slumps, which was 
amply demonstrated by Japan in 2000–2002, when the median Japanese equity 
mutual fund suffered losses of 30, 26, and 13 percent during those calendar 
years. Things haven’t been too good lately for these funds, either. The median 
Japanese equity mutual fund lost about 6 percent during the first half of 2008, 
resulting in a ten-year compound annual loss of 1.7 percent. (Oh, that pared-
down Zen aesthetic! We’ll have our brown rice and twig now, please.) Investors 
in the broader region fared better, as Asia–Pacific Rim mutual funds — which 
are free to lose money anywhere in the region — eked out a small profit of 3.3 
percent over those ten years, despite the Japan market’s woes.

187
 Chapter 12: Las Vegas–Style Equity Funds: Trips You Don’t Need
 
If you must go regional, you might try European funds, with their giant blue-
chip companies, and then perhaps Asia–Pacific Rim. But you’re probably 
better off with two or three global equity funds that hold assets in countries 
just about everywhere. Look at the holdings of nearly any big global equity 
fund and you’ll see European and Asian stocks as well as U.S. names.
The pros aren’t infallible, though, and they can easily get the mix of countries 
wrong. That’s why it’s important with global equity funds to avoid managers 
who make big bets on a particular region or country, such as China or India.
The following is a quick rundown of the main types of regional foreign equity 
funds. We won’t spend too much time on them — although we have to admit 
these narrow, specialized funds can be lots of fun.
European funds: Why are all 
these people so well dressed?
European funds invest almost entirely in major companies in big, stable 
European countries, so they’re a sensible choice compared with most specialty 
funds. However, after a fairly steady run of profits during the 1990s, these 
funds have produced uneven returns. This is partly due to the global technol-
ogy stock fallout of the early 1990s. The tech–telecom millennium stock party 
turned out to be just as deranged and overpriced as North America’s. The 
median European equity fund dropped almost 7 percent in 2000, 18 percent in 
2001, and 11 percent in 2002. Things subsequently improved, and returns have 
been steady since 2002, including a handsome 31-percent gain in 2006. The 
euro’s strength against the U.S. dollar (and our high-flying loonie as well) has 
been a boon for funds that invest on this continent.
 
Don’t bother trying to wager on currencies when you buy mutual funds — 
stick to rock climbing at night. The individual investor has little chance of pre-
dicting foreign exchange movements; even the experts in the forex trading pits 
are challenged!
 
As always, if you do go into Europe, buy more than one fund so that a dog 
doesn’t chew up your portfolio too badly. A simple way to do this is to buy 
one of the half-dozen European index funds available, as opposed to one of the 
hundred or so actively managed European equity funds. Index funds buy every 
stock in a recognized market index or benchmark so that they earn returns 
in line with the broad stock market. An actively managed fund, which is the 
most common type of fund, buys and sells stocks in an attempt to select the 
best ones — but it runs the risk of making the wrong choices. European index 
funds track the Morgan Stanley Capital International European Index, a well-
recognized benchmark for Europe’s biggest stocks.

188
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Asian funds: The dream that died
This is it — the biggest rollercoaster at the amusement park. A chart of the 
Asia–Pacific equity category’s calendar-year returns since 1990 is littered 
with double-digit gains and double-digit losses. But things have been mostly 
positive since the millennium; the category’s median five-year compound 
annual return was 9.5 percent as of mid-2008.
On the face of it, Asia presents a pretty enticing investment pitch. The success 
of many Asian countries in escaping their post-colonial poverty and building 
modern economies has been a genuine miracle, one of humanity’s greatest 
achievements (that and chocolate-chip ice cream). The region has a young 
population, pro-business governments (although often repressive), and an 
apparently insatiable desire to become as fat and self-satisfied as the West.
The region’s two established stock markets, Tokyo and Hong Kong, are being 
upstaged by the up-and-coming Shanghai exchange. You may have a hard 
time considering China a “developing” country — but it certainly is develop-
ing, and fast. As a trip to most any North American shopping mall will remind 
you, China quickly has become a global economic powerhouse.
Economics and politics aside, it’s hard to ignore Asia when investing out-
side Canada. But remember the last time you felt queasy on a rollercoaster? 
Investing in Asia likely will continue to be a wild ride, so tread lightly when 
considering an Asian fund investment. Or, again, consider doing so through a 
diversified global equity or international equity fund.
If you buy into Asia, your first choice is whether you want a fund that 
includes Japan or treats it as a completely separate market. No right or 
wrong answer exists here. Asian funds that also hold Japanese stocks rep-
resent a sort of handy one-stop-shopping investment in the Far East, much 
of which is an economic suburb of Japan anyway despite China’s recent 
economic surge. But, arguably, a specialized manager located in Tokyo has 
a better chance of getting it right in such a distinctive country, as Japan 
marches to its own very strange Kodo drumbeat. In 2007, the median Asia–
Pacific ex-Japan fund (the category representing funds in the region that do 
not invest in Japan) jumped more than 18 percent in 2007. Meantime, the 
median Japanese equity fund fell more than 21 percent. So it’s hard to believe 
a manager sitting in Hong Kong or London can hope to become as knowl-
edgeable about the Tokyo scene as someone right on the spot. That sug-
gests you’re better off buying a specialized Japanese fund (more about them 
below) plus an Asia ex-Japan fund that stays out of the Japanese market.

189
 Chapter 12: Las Vegas–Style Equity Funds: Trips You Don’t Need
A handful of “country” funds invest only in China, or India, or even a combina-
tion of the two. China’s economy, of course, has taken off in recent years, and 
six China funds were available to Canadian investors. India is essentially a con-
tinent in its own right, with a potentially giant stock market that moves to its 
own rhythm. As of mid-2008, but one India-only mutual fund existed. That fund, 
Excel India, had an unfathomable 202-percent return in 1999, its first full cal-
endar year. Its top holdings included Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. and United 
Phosphorus Ltd. — a bit more exciting and exotic than good old Royal Bank of 
Canada or Canadian Tire. Excel India went on to post huge losses the next two 
years, dropping 47 percent in 2000 and 34 percent in 2001. It has been on a tear 
in recent years, with one-year gains ranging from 24 to 83 percent from 2002 to 
2007, but then it lost nearly 39 percent during the first half of 2008.
Japanese, please: Once hot, now not
Japan, land of fast trains, paper walls, and coffin hotels. And, oddly, a place 
where Wall Street’s crash also happened, but ten years earlier. At the end of 
the 1980s, foreign investors in the then-red-hot Tokyo market reckoned that 
any price they paid for a stock was okay because the Japanese economy had 
moved to a new way of valuing assets. So, Nippon Telegraph traded at 100 
times its profits in 1989 and people weren’t worried — a bit like the way U.S. 
investors argued in early 2000 that they were being all prudent and careful 
when they paid 50 times earnings for a telephone-company stock because 
they were getting an “earnings yield” of 2 percent, which isn’t far short of the 
one-year deposit rate. See “U.S. equity funds: Land of the fat” in this chapter 
for an explanation of earnings yield and similar magic incantations.
But Japan crashed, as insane stock markets always do. By 1992, the Nikkei 
average of 225 big Japanese stocks had fallen by half from its highs of the late 
1980s and it went nowhere for the rest of the decade. The market made the 
occasional nice bounce off the bottom, but over the ten years from 1990 to 
2000 the median Japanese fund produced a miserable median annual return 
of 5.3 percent. By mid-2008, the ten-year annual “return” had turned into an 
exciting annual loss of 1.7 percent.
 
Nonetheless, Japan still is one of the world’s biggest economies, a powerhouse 
of ingenuity and brilliant design. Any country that has people who devote 
their lives to mastering the art of tea-pouring has to have something going for 
it. Everybody should have a small portion of their assets in the great Japanese 
global companies, such as Sony, Hitachi, and Fujitsu. We suggest you do it by 
buying a couple of conservative global equity funds. As with other major eco-
nomic regions of the world, most good global stock funds put at least some of 
their portfolio in Japan.

Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
U.S. equity funds: Land of the fat
Back in early 2000, the U.S. stock market looked like a very beautiful thing 
indeed — but we were standing on the slopes of a mountain, looking back 
at a gorgeous landscape that was a decade of strong performance. Then the 
millennium came and Wall Street fell onto hard times. From 2000 through 
How Andrew blew it in mutual funds — And how 
you can do better
The good news is that the only truly hot mutual 
fund Andrew ever owned, Altamira Japanese 
Opportunity, went up 123 percent in 1999. The 
bad news is that he invested a miserable $200 
in it. His failure at picking shoot-the-lights-out 
mutual funds pretty well convinced him it’s a 
crapshoot trying to figure out which volatile 
specialty funds will do well and which will bark. 
If you buy a few quality conservative funds 
from the start, you’ll do fine. Or better than he 
did, anyway. Around 1994, Andrew decided it 
would be a good source of newspaper stories 
if he opened accounts with as many fund com-
panies as he could, including banks and direct 
sellers such as Altamira. So he opened about 
ten small accounts, putting only about $1,000 in 
each or opening a $50 monthly pre-authorized 
contribution plan. That’s the industry’s beloved 
PAC, where they go into your bank account 
each month and take out the money. It’s actu-
ally something the fund companies often lose 
money on, because the investments are small 
and administration costs are high, so he reck-
oned there could be something in it for him.
Andrew will admit he’s a gambler by nature, so 
he went for pitbull-aggressive funds. He reck-
oned there was no gain without pain, stocks 
always go up, rah rah rah. Altamira Equity (then 
under the legendary heavy trader Frank Mersch) 
was his most conservative choice. Otherwise, it 
was frothy Asian and emerging markets funds, 
not to mention small-company nightmares and 
other stuff he prefers to forget. Needless to 
say, Andrew took some serious hits. The aver-
age emerging markets fund lost 7 percent in 
1995 and went down in a fairly straight line from 
there. Japanese funds delivered three straight 
years of losses — until the carnage of 2000 to 
2002, no asset class had probably inflicted that 
kind of damage since the stock market died in 
the 1930s. He also bought an energy fund and 
a precious metals fund, both of which crawled 
along the bottom until he dumped them around 
1998 and switched to regular equity funds.
Even Andrew’s Altamira Equity stumbled and 
fell as resource stocks wore out and financial 
stocks went up for three years straight. But 
what was up with old Frank? After all, he had 
the hottest numbers in the industry. That’s why 
Andrew bought the fund. He remembers once 
being at a presentation by some pension fund 
suits who presented the results of a survey that 
showed a single unnamed manager way out in 
front. Andrew asked who it was and was told: 
“That was Mersch.” But Frank didn’t like banks 
so he and Andrew missed the party. The lesson 
is this: Forget about small-cap junk, weird for-
eign markets, and managers who abandon 
large sections of the market — at least for the 
bulk of your savings. Buy funds that invest in a 
wide range of companies and countries that are 
familiar to you.

191
 Chapter 12: Las Vegas–Style Equity Funds: Trips You Don’t Need
2007, the median U.S. equity fund posted four calendar-year losses and only 
one double-digit gain. The other years saw slim gains. The credit crunch of 
2007–2008 made things even worse, and the median U.S. equity mutual fund 
had lost an additional 10 percent by mid-2008.
Maybe the good times will come back — or maybe U.S. stocks will become the 
greatest horror show in the history of investing as U.S. shares go on falling list-
lessly to earth with all the grace of crashing Boeing 747s. Unfortunately, you 
can’t tell what will happen. Nonetheless, America is the engine of the world’s 
economy, a magic lamp of creativity and intellect. So you must have at least 
some of your savings there. But you don’t have to buy regular U.S. equity funds 
that try to pick winning American stocks. Any sensible global equity fund 
will own plenty of U.S. companies, so owning a couple of those will give you 
American content. Add a U.S. equity index fund — one that tracks the entire 
U.S. market, usually by mimicking the famous Standard & Poor’s index of 500 
giant U.S. stocks — and you’ll have collected plenty of Americana.
In the U.S. market, you must own an index fund because the managers of U.S. 
equity funds sold in Canada have done a particularly pathetic job of keeping 
up with the S&P 500. The index produced an average annual loss of 0.8 per-
cent in Canadian-dollar terms over the ten years ended June 2008, better than 
the 2.5-percent loss from the median U.S. equity mutual fund. Nearly all U.S. 
index funds track the S&P 500 — but, as investors have discovered, the S&P 
500 is no perpetual motion machine that always goes up.
One of the reasons why the debacle of the new millennium has been so 
severe was that by the end of the 1990s the Standard & Poor’s index had 
established a virtuous but insane cycle in which the stocks that made up 
the index kept going higher simply because they were in the index, which 
induced investors to buy the stocks in the index at ever-higher prices 
because it was such a good index to invest in, if you get our drift. Now that’s 
all dandy while it works, but it’s also a bit like a Ponzi scheme, a fraud in 
which late arrivals to the scam pay off the first lucky investors.
 
If you want the most diversification in a U.S. index fund, have a look at the 
CIBC U.S. Index Fund, which tracks the Russell 5000 index, a massively 
broad measure that includes just about every stock that matters in the 
United States. The idea is that if a long-term decline occurs in the huge 
blue-chip stocks such as Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Inc. that 
dominate the S&P 500, then you’ll be hedging your bets by owning lots of 
smaller companies. Speaking of blue-chips, it doesn’t get much bluer than 
the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 industrial stocks — even your aging 
Aunt Betty in North Bay has heard of “the Dow.” While the S&P 500 is a 
much better barometer of large U.S. stocks, the Dow Jones industrial aver-
age is still the most-quoted U.S. index. If you like the familiarity, you can 
buy an index fund that tracks it, such as the imaginatively named TD Dow 
Jones Industrial Average Index.

192
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
Don’t forget that U.S. equity funds are like any type of regional or otherwise 
overly focused fund: You don’t really have to own them. Any well-run global 
fund will contain a large number of U.S. stocks, because America is just too 
dynamic to ignore.
Emerging markets funds: And you 
thought you were corrupt
Emerging markets or developing countries — we’ll drop the euphemisms and 
call these nations what they are: poor. At least two-thirds of the world’s popu-
lation lives in places such as Ghana and Malaysia, where industrial society and 
all of its plush comforts have yet to fully take root. But why invest there? The 
theory is that these economies are growing fast from a low level of activity, as 
opposed to the “mature” economies of the West. Fast growth means corporate 
profits that are rising quickly — and that’s good for stocks, remember?
So these markets are supposed to give you higher long-term returns, at the 
cost of bigger price swings because shares in these strange places are rela-
tively unstable and prone to dangers such as currency collapse (which nearly 
always happens, don’t kid yourself).
Emerging markets have outperformed many other markets in recent years. 
The median emerging markets equity mutual fund gained nearly 20 percent 
during the five years to June 2008, compounded annually, compared with 5.4 
percent for global equity mutual funds. However, emerging markets are small 
and thus far more volatile than North American and other developed markets. 
That means one or two foreign lads with MBAs — fund managers from the rich 
world — can make the whole index go up and down. Emerging markets will 
move independently from developed markets. If your Wall Street shares are 
tanking, your investment in a Brazilian sewer digger might be doing just fine.
Although the performance numbers have been attractive, you need to ask your-
self if you can put up with the volatility. Prior to the recent run-up, an emerging 
markets fund’s returns for the most part were up one year, down the next. As 
brokers are reputed to say about a junk stock, “It’s for trading, not for owning.”
Bear in mind other complications with emerging markets, too. One minor 
difficulty: Managers don’t agree on what constitutes a developing market. 
Some funds have a broad definition of what constitutes a developing market. 
For example, many emerging markets funds will invest in Hong Kong–listed 
stocks — needless to say, a well developed market — in addition to emerg-
ing markets in the region like Thailand and Vietnam. That produces a more 
conservative mixture of investments that can protect investors from some of 
the nasty drops in emerging markets. But it also could mean missing out on 
big rallies.

193
 Chapter 12: Las Vegas–Style Equity Funds: Trips You Don’t Need
 
The big problem for investors in emerging markets funds is the tendency of 
nervous managers to slavishly buy the same few stocks around the world, 
usually the local phone company, in whatever emerging markets they like. So 
buying two or even three emerging markets funds may not spread your risk as 
much as you might think — the portfolios often contain the same stuff. In fair-
ness to managers, they’re often forced to stick to one or two big stocks in a lot 
of developing countries because at least they know some sort of professional 
supervision of the corporate executives is happening, supplied by the other 
foreign investment managers who own the stock. Many developing countries, 
like the United States 100 years ago, are still at a stage of cowboy capitalism in 
which corruption and sharp dealing are rampant.
What ever happened to Latin American funds?
One obvious emerging markets zone is Latin 
America. These funds at one time were numer-
ous enough to justify a separate category. But 
investors were reluctant to put all their emerg-
ing markets eggs into one geographic basket. 
By mid-2002, many Latin American equity funds 
were showing double-digit losses on a ten-year 
compound annual basis. Fund companies, tired 
of the poor sales, began to shut down their Latin 
funds, rolling them into their existing emerging 
markets funds.
Wouldn’t you know it: Latin American markets 
have produced strong gains since then. The 
four remaining Latin funds — now lumped into 
the oddball “specialty” category, which we 
cover in Chapter 18 — all had five-year com-
pound annual gains near 30 percent or more 
as of mid-2008. You don’t necessarily have 
to own one of these three — they’re offered 
by Fidelity, Scotia, and TD — to invest in the 
region, because most emerging markets funds 
have sizeable positions there.
Latin American markets are about as dangerous 
as they come. The main justification for invest-
ing in Latin America, as with Asia or emerg-
ing markets in general, is that these countries 
are still in the early stages of their economic 
growth, which means companies there have 
lots of room to expand. In practice, most man-
agers in the group end up with nearly all of 
their assets in Mexico and Brazil because the 
other countries in the region are too small or too 
impoverished to offer many opportunities. Yes, 
Latin America has managed a wonderful transi-
tion to pretty good democracy, leaving its brutal 
military regimes of the 1980s behind. However, 
some exceptions exist — including, much to 
the frustration of the U.S. government, oil-rich 
Venezuela. And Latin American politicians still 
have an unpleasant habit of papering over the 
cracks in their economies until after they have 
been elected. At that point, they announce the 
bad news, sending their currency and stock 
market sliding. Fresh-faced foreign portfolio 
managers are inevitably brought along for the 
ride. Sorry, gringo.

194
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Don’t get us wrong — we love emerging markets funds, but only as a form of 
amusement. We enjoy the exotic names, the strange companies, and the poten-
tial for huge returns. But the evidence seems to be that as the world’s markets 
become linked ever more closely, shares in developing markets are simply 
going to track those of rich countries. And most well-run global equity funds 
hold at least a few big companies in developing markets anyway, which further 
reduces your need to bother with a specialized emerging markets fund. Sure, 
put a small portion of your portfolio, at most a few percent, in these funds. But 
don’t go banking on double-digit returns — they come along all too rarely.
Sector Funds: Limitations Galore
Funds that buy stocks in just one industry or sector of the economy — for 
example, technology or resource funds — are bucking broncos, producing wild 
leaps and sickening plunges. That’s because investors have a long-standing 
habit, as we’ve seen, of suddenly falling in love with a particular type of stock 
and then bidding those companies’ shares to ridiculous prices.
The most recent biotech rally was in 2000, when it wasn’t unusual to see 
obscure biotech stocks in Toronto jumping fourfold in a couple of weeks. The 
median healthcare fund jumped 38 percent that year. Then somebody dropped 
a jar and biotechs went squelch, and the category fell nearly 35 percent over 
the next two years.
 
Specialized funds are far more volatile than high-quality diversified equity 
funds that hold all industries, the first of our ABC rules in Chapter 10.
The volatility of these funds means they’re essentially a gimmick, and not the 
place for your serious money. Still, they can be fun. Those who enjoy trading 
can use no-load sector funds as a cheap vehicle for jumping aboard a trend 
(or what they fondly hope is a trend). And some of the ideas that fund sellers 
have come up with are impressive: At the end of this section, we talk about 
some of the weirder sector and specialty funds.
But investors should consider only two types of sector funds:
 
 Resource and precious metals funds may arguably have a place in the 
portfolios of those who are very worried about inflation.
 
 Technology funds, despite their difficulties in recent years, may be good 
long-term holdings because at least the companies they own are doing 
something new (although all too often lately it’s dreaming up new ways

Resource funds: Pouring 
money down a hole
Resource funds buy companies that used to be the backbone of Canada’s 
economy: macho, doughnut-eating types that sell oil, forest products, miner-
als, and basic commodities like aluminum. For complicated reasons to do 
with oversupply and shifty men meeting in damp hotel rooms in Belgium, the 
prices for these commodities tend to be extremely volatile, often doubling or 
falling by half in a matter of months. That means the shares of resource com-
panies are incredibly prone to swings.
Investors in resource companies must get used to living like teenage girls in 
their first week in junior high. One day they’re up, everyone loves them and 
their shares, and profits are rolling in as commodity prices rock. The next day, 
prices are down and suddenly everyone in the class thinks you’re a freak.
Take oil, for example. Periodically since the 1970s — and most spectacularly 
in the past few years — the producers have been able to get together in 
one of those Belgian hotel rooms, sip warm beer, and rig prices for a while. 
Oil company stocks duly rise accordingly. But it’s pretty well a mug’s game 
trying to predict when oil booms will come and go, and oil exploration com-
panies have been abysmal at creating long-term wealth for their sharehold-
ers. When their shares rise, they tend to flood new share issues into the hot 
market to grab as much cash from investors as possible while the going is 
good — sorry, to raise capital for developing new reserves. Eventually, exist-
ing shareholders realize that, thanks a lot, they now must give some of the 
company’s profits and dividends to all those scruffy new shareholders. Then 
oil prices tank again and, presto, oil stocks collapse. No wonder investors in 
Canada have largely favoured oil and gas income trusts, which at least pay 
out a steady stream of cash. (Refer to Chapter 5 for more on income trusts.)
 
Although natural resource funds have been on a roll since the millennium, if 
you look farther back in time you’ll be reminded of how uneven this market 
can be. In the second half of the 1990s, resource funds were a rough place to 
invest, with the average fund in the group posting back-to-back losses in 1997 
and 1998, in an era when consecutive yearly losses were still rare. Resource 
funds delivered an abysmal annual return of just 3.1 percent during the 
1990s. But when the tech became long in the tooth, investors began to look 
elsewhere and turned to natural resources. Many commodity stocks took 
off — especially in oil and gold, which were lifted by soaring prices for energy 
and bullion — and resource funds posted strong gains in 1999 and 2000. Their 
gains cooled somewhat in 2002, but then took off again. As of mid-2008, the 
median natural resource mutual fund had posted a five-year compound annual 
return of nearly 29 percent.

196
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
The rise in precious metals funds, which buy mostly gold miners’ stocks (the 
easiest way to bet on gold), also has been spectacular. The price of gold bullion 
prices rose from less than US$260 an ounce in early 2001 to nearly US$1,000 by 
mid-2008. Despite a money-losing 2004, the median precious metals mutual fund 
had a five-year compound annual return of more than 20 percent as of mid-2008.
Why has the price of gold shot up? Well, conspiracy theories abound when 
it comes to precious metals prices (dark mutterings abound of a plot to keep 
gold down to protect the U.S. dollar), but the simple answer is that gold tends 
to rise when the world loses confidence in its paper money as a store of value. 
And the U.S. greenback certainly has had its woes of late, thanks to the poli-
cies of the Bush administration and the credit crisis. Gold is the world’s oldest 
form of money. It soared back in 1980, when investors around the world were 
scared that geopolitics was spinning out of control (Jimmy Carter had just 
stumbled through the Iranian hostage situation and the Soviet Union had 
invaded Afghanistan). Inflation is also great for gold prices because it means 
paper money is losing its value, which makes timeless and readily portable bul-
lion more valuable. But gold slid during the 1990s, after Communism collapsed 
and America basked in a low-inflation golden age. The latest rally in gold began 
as a partial recovery from bullion’s slump in the late 1990s — for most of that 
decade, the yellow metal traded well above $325 before heading south.
 
Very conservative investors may wish to put small amounts into a couple of 
diversified resource funds, perhaps a couple of percent of one’s portfolio in 
each fund, or even a couple of gold funds. That’s because resource stocks 
can act as portfolio insurance — commodity prices move in their own weird 
cycles, and sometimes in the opposite direction to stocks in general.
Before you rush to buy into resource stocks along with everybody else, or 
catch the gold bug a little too late, consider a much simpler and somewhat 
less risky way to invest in these markets: Just buy a Canadian equity fund, 
large-cap or small (see Chapters 10 and 11). If you do decide to buy resource 
funds, try to buy two with very different portfolio mixtures of forestry, 
energy, mining, and other commodities. That way, if one manager crashes 
and burns, the other might make it. And if you buy into gold funds, make sure 
you hold at least two, because managers can easily miss out on the very hot-
test mining stocks that are leading the whole group higher. Remember, with 
most precious metals funds you are buying mining companies, not bullion.
Science and technology funds: But how 
will you control it, Professor?
Technology funds can buy virtually anything as long as it has something to 
do with computers, telecommunications, biotechnology, or research. But 
they’re really just super-high-growth equity funds that hold fancy companies 
trading at Versace-type prices.

197
 Chapter 12: Las Vegas–Style Equity Funds: Trips You Don’t Need
Back in 1994, Canada had about five science and technology funds. By the 
end of the decade at least 35 existed, and by mid-2002 more than 100 were 
kicking around. Incredible returns on technology stocks during the 1990s, 
which reached a hysterical climax of greed and speculation by 2000, pro-
duced 100-percent-plus returns for investors in technology funds who were 
brave enough to hang on for the whole ride. Then the technology market 
collapsed. The median science and technology fund posted massive losses 
from 2000 through 2002, then recovered somewhat in 2003. Since then the 
category has stumbled along, posting small gains or losses each year. The 
typical investor who didn’t get out in time lost all the profits he or she made 
during the run-up in tech stocks, and then some.
We’ll spare you a dull sermon about the danger of investing in wild tech 
funds. Back in 1999 and 2000, people just had to look at the sort of returns 
these things had posted, and a shifty, greedy look came into their eyes. And, 
for all we know, technology stocks might start climbing again, to as-yet-
undreamed-of heights. Doesn’t seem likely, though. So if you think the party’s 
going to continue, go ahead and buy these funds.
 
If you decide to buy a science and technology fund — and we advise against 
it for most investors because of the excessive risk — limit your investment to 
less than 5 percent of your total fund holdings.
Some people reckon they’ve got a pretty sharp tooth when it comes to 
technology, which lets them predict which industries will do best next. In 
that case, you could select more specialized types of tech funds, such as a 
telecommunications fund, which gives you “exposure” (money management 
slang for a chance to profit from something) to telephone, Internet, and wire-
less companies that continue to revolutionize communications — and that 
drive consumers crazy with incomprehensible telecommunications “bundles” 
and little hand-held devices that presented frightening challenges to our 
thumbs and necks and have created a whole new treatment-specialty area for 
physiotherapists and orthopedic surgeons. Or you could consider investing 
in a biotechnology fund, which buys into obscure companies selling strange 
new drugs and bits of protein in jars.
Technology fund managers like to put on statesmanlike, long-term faces and 
predict that the companies in their portfolios today will be the giant house-
hold names of tomorrow, as though the kids will be pestering you to take 
them out to look at the new network routers from Cisco Systems or log on to 
Sun Microsystems’ latest servers.
The high priests and priestesses of tech-forever may have a point, and these 
companies could have many years of exponential growth ahead of them. So 
there could be a good case for holding a tech fund if you’re investing for long 
periods of, say, ten years or more. But a few good global and Canadian equity 
funds, including index funds, will own plenty of the big tech stocks that show 
up in specialized technology funds — so, once again, you’ll probably be well 

198
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
covered by simply sticking with your core equity funds. As with so many 
other specialty funds, buy these only for fun. And get ready to take some 
spills along the way.
 
Beware of markets in which people buy for trading, not for owning. They have 
a nasty habit of collapsing.
Financial services funds: Buying 
the banks doesn’t always pay
Everybody hates the banks — except as investments, it seems. The Canadian 
financial services sector is dominated by the huge Big Five banks and several 
mammoth life insurance companies. Indeed, these institutions are almost as 
big a driver of the Canadian stock market as resource companies. However, 
most funds in the financial services category invest globally, so you are 
buying into not just Canadian institutions but U.S. and overseas ones as 
well. So if you want to buy Canadian financials, stick to the Canadian equity 
category — which, as we keep preaching, is a better place to be anyway.
The median financial services fund produced five- and ten-year compound 
annual returns in the range of 1 to 2 percent as of mid-2008, well below the 
returns posted by the median Canadian equity fund. Funds in this sector 
fared better, more or less, than global and U.S. equity funds, though, which 
strengthens the case to buy Canadian in this sector.
 
If you insist on focusing on the Canadian financials rather than participating 
in this sector through a diversified Canadian equity fund, you can buy the 
iShares Canadian Financial Sector Index ETF. Its five-year compound annual 
return at mid-2008 was 11.5 percent.

E
ver have a really good roti — a West Indian treat packed with extra 
spices, tasty meat, and East Indian–style stuff like chickpeas? Remember 
the wonderful numb feeling of fullness afterward? Balanced funds are sup-
posed to be a satisfying all-in-one meal like that. You hand your money over 
to the fund company or bank, and they make all the decisions. A balanced 
fund is a nice broad mixture of many types of investment — the idea being 
that it’ll never lose too much money. The manager usually invests the fund in 
a cautious blend of stocks, which are tiny pieces of ownership of companies, 
and long-term and short-term bonds, which are debts owed by governments 
and companies.
Balanced funds are investment products you buy when you want nice steady 
returns of around 4 to 7 percent per year while avoiding losses as much as 
possible. They’re one of the mutual fund industry’s most useful inventions 
and an excellent place for the nervous beginner to get going. In this chapter, 
we introduce you to the main types of balanced funds, explain why they’re a 
great way to start off in investing, and warn you about the problems you may 
encounter.

Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Understanding Balanced Funds
Balanced funds are for busy people who want a one-decision product they 
can buy and forget about. Imagine your family had a trusted lawyer or 
accountant who took care of all of your investing needs — the professional, 
if he or she were at all prudent, would end up putting the money into a judi-
cious blend of bonds and stocks, with a healthy cushion of cash to further 
reduce risk. That’s the essence of a balanced fund — it includes a little bit of 
everything so that losses can be kept to a minimum if one type of investment 
falls in value.
Balanced funds, which have been around since the dawn of the fund indus-
try in the 1920s in one form or another, have attracted billions of dollars in 
recent years as confused investors decide to let someone else pick the right 
mix for their savings. As of June 2008, more than $250 billion in total assets 
were in some sort of balanced fund. That’s a lot of coin when you consider 
it’s not too far off the equity fund total of $311 billion. (These figures are from 
the Investment Funds Institute of Canada, which represents most mutual 
fund sponsors.)
Reviewing the asset mix of balanced funds
For most investors, a balanced fund should be a ready-made cautious 
investment portfolio. Yes, it might lose money — nothing is absolutely safe 
in investing — but it’s unlikely to drop as much as 10 percent in a year. Just 
check the fund’s mix of assets at the fund company’s Web site or in its hand-
outs. If the fund holds plenty of bonds and cash, it’s probably safe enough 
to buy.
Happily, the knowledgeable and practical folks who supervise the classifica-
tion of Canadian investment funds into various asset categories, the Canadian 
Investment Funds Standards Committee, several years ago split the unwieldy 
Canadian balanced and global balanced categories each into three subsets. 
The following categories help investors immediately identify a fund’s asset mix:
 
 Equity balanced funds have at least 60 percent of their portfolio in 
equities.
 
 Fixed-income balanced funds have no more than 40 percent of their 
portfolio in equities.
 
 Neutral balanced funds have between 40 and 60 percent of their 
portfolio in equities.
To keep things simple, in this chapter we primarily refer to the middle-of-the-
road Canadian neutral balanced category.

201
 Chapter 13: Balanced Funds: Boring Can Be Good
 
Remember the old rule that your portfolio’s weighting in bonds plus cash 
should equal your age? If we assume the average Canadian balanced fund has 
54 percent in stocks and 46 percent in guaranteed investments like bonds and 
cash, then most neutral balanced funds are suitable for investors aged about 
46. So if you’re younger, look for a slightly more aggressive mix in an equity 
balanced fund, and if you’re older, try to find a fixed income balanced fund 
that appeals to you.
Plodding along profitably
The good news is that Canadian balanced funds have done a pretty good job 
of avoiding — or at least limiting — losses. In 2002, the last calendar year 
in which Canadian equity funds lost money, with the median fund falling 
nearly 13 percent, the median Canadian neutral balanced fund fell about 6 
percent. Of course, balanced funds do a decent job of limiting gains, too. As 
of mid-2008, the median Canadian equity fund did more than twice as well as 
the median Canadian neutral balanced fund in terms of five-year compound 
annual return: 16.3 percent versus 7.9 percent.
In terms of a global balanced fund — a type of fund we really like because it 
provides as much diversification as possible within a single fund — it’s even 
better. In 2002, the median global equity fund plummeted more than 20 percent 
while the median global neutral balanced fund fell just 4.4 percent. Yet despite 
the more hospitable years for stock markets that followed, the balanced funds 
managed to match the five-year compound annual return of the equity funds, 
at 5.4 percent. Part of this is due to 2007, when global equities were dragged 
down by the debacle in the U.S. stock market, while Canadian stocks shone.
Now, we know that, over the years, a few weak balanced funds got lost in the 
shuffle after they were merged into better funds, but that’s not a bad showing. 
The fund industry, always remember, has a habit of quietly folding under-
performers into its stars, cancelling the dogs’ years of terrible returns. For 
example, Fidelity in the mid-1990s took a weak balanced fund and popped it 
inside its huge Fidelity Canadian Asset Allocation Fund. The old fund’s poor 
returns vanished forever. It’s always possible that you’ll find yourself stuck in a 
similar underperformer. To minimize that risk, the best solution of all is to hold 
two balanced funds so that your entire portfolio doesn’t suffer from weakness 
in one fund. (Morningstar calculates rates of return that overcome this data 
weakness — known to data geeks and analysts as survivorship bias — with its 
Morningstar fund indices; for more about these indices, see Chapter 21.)
 
Don’t worry: Despite the broad licence many fund managers have taken in 
their definition, balanced funds are all about simplicity. Until you make up 
your mind about your long-term investing plans, you’ll almost certainly do fine 
over three to five years by simply buying a regular balanced fund, or two for 
more safety, and then forgetting about them.

202
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Retiring with balanced funds
If you really want to adopt a simple approach, use balanced funds in your reg-
istered retirement savings plan — a special account in which investment gains 
add up without being taxed until you take them out, usually at retirement (see 
Chapter 22). Balanced funds are a nice cautious mix, just the thing you want for 
your life savings. Younger investors can be more aggressive, putting nearly all of 
their money into stocks, but above the age of 35 it’s a wise idea to own bonds as 
well. Nothing is forever. If you decide later that you want something else in your 
RRSP, maybe because the balanced fund you picked turned out to be a dog, then 
it should be a simple matter to shift the money to another fund or funds within 
the same RRSP or to another RRSP account without incurring taxes.
So if you just want a simple investment to buy and forget, go for one or two bal-
anced funds. A balanced fund has a single unit value that’s published daily in 
the newspapers and on the Internet, making the value of your holdings easy to 
check. Its return appears in the papers every month and on the Internet every 
day. And the performance is also published clearly by the fund company, or 
should be. As with any regular mutual fund, if you’ve bought a pooch the whole 
world can see, the fund manager will be under pressure to improve it.
Steering clear of potholes: Consistently 
strong returns
Balanced fund managers’ scaredy-cat caution has served investors well. As 
stocks slid in the first half of 2002, the average balanced fund escaped with 
a modest loss of 5.9 percent, less than half as bad as the median Canadian 
equity fund.
During the last 25 years, the only year in which Canadian equity funds posted 
a loss that was less severe than that of Canadian neutral balanced funds was in 
1994, when the equity funds lost 2.6 percent while the balanced group fell 3.1 
percent. But that wasn’t really the fault of the balanced fund managers. Interest 
rates jumped suddenly that year, slashing the value of the bonds they held.
Otherwise, balanced funds have generated nice steady returns, just as they’re 
supposed to. But remember that balanced funds — and all other investors who 
own bonds — have had a gale at their backs since the early 1990s, because 
the drop in inflation has made bonds steadily more valuable. (See Chapter 14 
for more on bonds.) Then the inflation rate spiked in mid-2008, precipitating a 
reminder that bonds easily can under-perform stocks. The Canadian consumer 
price index doubled to 3.4 percent during the second quarter of 2008. During 
that period, the median Canadian fixed-income fund fell nearly a percentage 
point, while Canadian Equity funds jumped more than 7 percent. Thanks to the 
sagging bond market, Canadian neutral balanced mutual funds were held to a 
modest 1.4 percent return during the quarter.

203
 Chapter 13: Balanced Funds: Boring Can Be Good
 
If we move into an era of deflation (that is, falling prices), bonds will almost 
certainly become increasingly more valuable because the value of their steady 
payouts of cash rises consistently. In that case, which unfortunately could 
involve a very painful recession, balanced funds could easily outperform stock 
funds. But whatever happens, the point remains: A balanced fund is a safe 
spot for your money, leaving you to get on with your life.
Taking a look at one balanced biggie
Take a look at the biggest Canadian neutral balanced fund, Royal Bank 
of Canada’s RBC Balanced Fund, to get an idea of how a traditional bal-
anced fund works. In mid-2008, this fund had just over $9 billion in assets. 
Remember, that’s more than a million dollars 9,000 times over — so obvi-
ously the bank has been delivering something that Mr. and Ms. Canada want: 
an attractive rate of return with minimal losses.
Here’s a breakdown of the fund’s assets:
 
 30 percent in Canadian stocks
 
 16 percent in shares outside Canada
 
 Just under one-third in bonds
 
 About 10 percent in cash
The fund has a one-year loss of 0.4 percent as of mid-2008, performing 
slightly better than the 0.8-percent loss posted by the median Canadian neu-
tral balanced fund. At 5.4 percent, its ten-year compound annual return was 
a tad better than the median fund’s 5 percent. In other words, it was a typical 
balanced fund: a solid investment that’s fine for your portfolio if one of your 
key objectives is security.
Reviewing the Problems 
with Balanced Funds
Balanced funds, both Canadian and global, have their problems. Their fees 
and expenses are far too lavish, which scythes into investors’ already modest 
returns. Fund companies have come up with their usual bewildering variety 
of products and combinations of products, waving magic wands and mutter-
ing incantations that invoke the gods of portfolio theory and the “efficient 
frontier.” It may all be true, but one thing’s for sure: You’re paying for it. All 
balanced products are basically porridge. Returns from their different invest-
ments are mixed together in a gooey mess, so judging exactly how well the 
manager did on which asset is hard.

204
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
High fees and expenses
The costs and fees charged to balanced fund unitholders are just too high. 
Fund companies already run big equity and bond funds, paying the salaries 
and expenses of the people who manage them, and they usually get those 
people to help select the stuff in their balanced funds. How much extra work 
is involved in that? The bond manager basically just does the same job again 
with his or her portion of the balanced fund, and the equity manager does 
the same. Some geezer in a huge black robe and cone-shaped hat decides 
what the asset mix will be and you’re away to the races. As Table 13-1 shows, 
the median Canadian neutral balanced fund vacuums up 2.5 percent of its 
investors’ money each year, almost as bad as the 2.6 percent charged by the 
average Canadian equity fund.

The long-term annual return from balanced funds may be only about 7 per-
cent, or even less. The long term, incidentally, means the rest of our lives, 
as economists like to say (it’s the only joke they know). So, say inflation and 
taxes combined take 4 percent out of your annual 6 percent — then your real 
return is down to around 3 percent. So, for a tax-paying account, most of your 
real return from a balanced fund like Royal Bank’s giant may go into fund 
expenses and fees.
Bewildering brews of assets
Fund companies know that many of their customers just want simple solu-
tions they can buy and never look at again. So they’ve come up with a bewil-
dering array of balanced combinations in which you can buy their wares. See 
Chapter 20 on fund packages for more. Many of these arrangements, such as 
Mackenzie Financial Corp.’s “Star” and AGF’s “Elements” packages, have their 
own unit values, making them look very much like mutual funds themselves. 
By mid-2008, more than 2,200 Canadian and global balanced funds existed, 
counting different “classes” of fund units as separate funds.

205
 Chapter 13: Balanced Funds: Boring Can Be Good
Difficulty judging fund 
manager performance
A big difficulty with balanced funds, or any kind of casserole that you buy from 
a fund company, is that you may have a hard time knowing just what the man-
ager did right or wrong. He or she may have blown it in bonds, or struck out 
in stocks, but you can’t work it out from the comfortable-looking (you hope) 
overall return number that the company publishes. Some fund companies 
provide a commentary that at least gives you a clue as to what went right and 
what exploded in the manager’s shiny little face. For many customers that’s 
fine, because they couldn’t care less what went on inside the fund as long as 
the return is reasonably good. And that’s a perfectly sensible approach to take 
if you don’t have the time or interest to look further into mutual funds. But bal-
anced funds are opaque and mysterious, violating one of the huge virtues of 
mutual funds — the ability to check on performance easily.
Because checking where balanced funds’ profits came from is difficult, pick-
ing the right fund is harder than it is to pick funds in other categories. In 
other words, you won’t get a clear answer to this crucial question: How much 
risk did the manager take? Here’s an extreme example of two imaginary funds 
to help illustrate the point.
Say you’re trying to choose between two balanced funds:
 
 The Tasmanian Devil Fund, which made an average 11 percent over the 
past ten years, enough to turn $10,000 into $28,394
 
 The Mellow Llama Fund, which made 9 percent a year and turned 
$10,000 into $23,674, or almost $5,000 less than the Tasmanian Devil
What if the Devil Fund made its bigger profits by buying bonds and shares 
issued by risky little technology companies, whereas the Llama Fund owned 
shares and bonds from big and stable companies and governments? Most 
balanced fund investors would choose the second fund, because the danger 
of it crashing and losing, say, half of its value in a year is so much less.
The Devil Fund, with its volatile but high-profit-potential stocks, may be suit-
able for an investor who doesn’t need the money for years and can afford to 
take risks now. But it’s not the right fund for an investor who may need the 
money at any time.

206
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
A Simple Plan for Picking the Right 
Canadian Balanced Fund
When selecting a balanced fund, you needn’t get all worked up about pick-
ing the right one. Like money market and bond funds, many balanced funds 
resemble one another. They’re run cautiously, remember, so you’re unlikely 
to go too far wrong.
 
Too many investors make one classic mistake that has cost millions of dollars: 
Failing to think twice before buying a balanced fund run by the people who 
also manage your stock fund. First, it will almost certainly be skewed toward 
equities. Second, within the fund’s equity section, you’ll likely be putting too 
many eggs in one basket within the fund’s equity section. Naturally, the man-
agers will tend to select the same shares for both funds, and if they get that 
wrong, then both of your funds will be poor performers.
 
We frequently refer to the neutral categories in this chapter because we feel 
these represent the only true, traditional balanced funds — the type that pro-
vide the uninspiring but steady performance making these funds so popular 
and fundamental to the average Canadian investor.

Knowing what to avoid
 
Be careful with balanced funds that don’t include just about every industry in 
their list of stock holdings. After all, if they are truly “balanced,” the balance 
should extend across industry sectors (and, in the case of bonds, maturity 
dates). Consider the fate of investors in the Ivy Growth & Income Fund — with 
assets of about $2.3 billion, one of the biggest Canadian balanced funds as of 
mid-2008. The fund was very overweight in consumer staples stocks, which 
took a beating during the first half of 2008. (“Overweight” refers to its position 
relative to that of the benchmark index, the S&P/TSX composite, which had 
just 2.2 percent of its constituent stocks in the consumer staples group as of 
mid-2008.) As a result, the fund lost 4 percent during that period, while the 
median Canadian equity balanced fund slipped 0.4 percent.
Identifying the best funds
 
Relax: Picking a good-quality Canadian balanced fund is surprisingly easy. 
Easier, anyway, than getting a cranky, tired child into a snowsuit at 7 a.m. 
Look for the following:
 
 A wide asset mix to reduce the fund’s risk of loss: Under the indus-
try’s agreed definition, a middle-of-the-road (that is, neutral) balanced 
fund should have at least 40 percent of its portfolio anchored in cash 
or bonds or other liquid short-term securities. (Liquidity is a measure of 
how easy it is to sell an investment without suffering a significant loss.)
 
 Low expenses: This is important because returns are relatively modest 
with this type of fund. Try to choose a fund or funds with annual 
expenses lower than the median 2.3 percent for Canadian neutral bal-
anced funds.
Looking at some high-quality 
balanced funds
 
In this section, we list the picks of the litter in Canadian balanced funds. 
Because being obsessive about costs is essential when buying this type 
of fund, we’ve limited the sample to funds with modest annual fees and 
expenses. Remember, though, if inflation and/or interest rates rise abruptly, 
then even the most boring of Canadian balanced funds will probably lose 
money. That’s because the value of both their stock and bond portfolios will 
almost certainly go on the slide at the same time. Here are a few high-quality 
Canadian balanced funds, chosen with the help of analysts at Morningstar:

 TD Dividend Income is an example of why you can’t judge a fund’s 
content by its name. This fund is actually a balanced fund; its sibling TD 
Dividend Growth is classified as a dividend income fund. Anyway, TD 
Dividend Income is a little more aggressive than most balanced funds 
because it invests heavily in banking and other financial services stocks. 
Before you dismiss it as being too volatile for your balanced fund tastes, 
realize it has an excellent management team at its helm. The equity por-
tion of the fund has more individual holdings than the typical balanced 
fund and they tend to be more conservative picks, helping to offset 
some of the risk. On the fixed-income side, the portfolio has more corpo-
rate bonds than most other balanced funds, but this extra credit risk is 
tempered by a very conservative duration stance. (Bond investing can 
be complicated; see Chapter 14.)
 
 The managers are part of a team that looks after TD’s top-rated income-
oriented fund lineup. These funds are a good example of how the banks 
have become extremely competitive in the mutual fund industry. We dis-
cuss the banks’ role in the industry in Chapter 7.
 
 CI Signature High Income is a balanced fund that provides a good 
income stream. Its blend of common equities, income trusts, and high-
yield debt has historically given it an asset mix unlike any other fund in 
the Canadian equity balanced category. Although this fund brings some 
risks to the balanced-fund table — it generally does not invest in govern-
ment debt or even investment-grade bonds, preferring higher-yield cor-
porate issues — it mitigates this risk by moving into cash when market 
storm clouds gather. It also has been known to invest in floating-rate 
notes, which offer partial protection against rising interest rates because 
their coupons adjust to rate fluctuations. Eric Bushell, the fund’s lead 
manager, has a terrific track record on this and other CI funds. And you 
get top management for a very reasonable 1.55 percent in annual fund 
expenses.
 
 PH&N Balanced is a more traditional balanced fund with an asset allo-
cation of 60 percent equities, 35 percent bonds, and 5 percent cash. 
Unlike many of its peers, it has the ability to invest anywhere in the 
world, although as of mid-2008 it was classified in the Canadian neutral 
balanced category. The fund’s Canadian, U.S., international, and bond 
managers all have excellent track records, and it is another fund that 
offers solid management at a bargain. Its annual expenses are just 0.86 
percent — way below the 2.3 percent charged by the median fund in the 
category.

Global Balanced Funds — As Good 
as It Gets?
Those who want to chase (possibly) higher returns outside Canada while 
spreading their wealth over a huge range of investments may want to explore 
global balanced funds, which, like Canadian balanced funds, come in three 
varieties: equity balanced, neutral balanced, and fixed-income balanced. (For 
definitions of each of those categories, see “Understanding Balanced Funds” 
in this chapter.)
 
As always, check the top holdings in the portfolio of a global balanced fund. 
If they’re not mostly stocks and bonds issued by giant companies that you’ve 
already heard of, plus bonds from countries such as the United States, 
Germany, and Japan, then look elsewhere. Why take a risk on low-quality 
investments?
Like their Canadian counterparts, global balanced funds pull off the trick of 
buying a bit of everything, but the fact that they do it globally gives you even 
more diversification and the potential for higher returns. Very few have been 
around for even ten years, but the median global neutral balanced mutual 
fund’s five-year annualized return as of June 2008 was 5.4 percent, well 
behind Canadian equity funds dragged down by fixed-income investments. 
Figure 13-2 compares performance of the three global balanced categories.

Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
Insisting on low costs is important with any balanced fund, Canadian or global, 
because so much of the portfolio is made up of steady-but-dull bonds and 
cash, and that keeps annual gains down. So if you want to be left with a decent 
return, you can’t pay too much.
The median global neutral balanced fund hits its investors for 2.36 percent 
in expenses each year. That MER works out to $118 annually on a $5,000 
investment. Some global balanced funds charge well above that, in excess of 
3 percent. These include funds with fancy features, such as segregated funds — 
funds that provide guarantees to refund some or all of your original investment 
after ten years or to pay at least that much to your heirs (those snivelling jel-
lyfish), even if the fund has in fact produced a loss. These guaranteed or “seg-
regated” funds may give you enormous satisfaction in knowing your money is 
protected. For that reason, thousands of people buy them. But, like the over-
priced extended warranty that pushy electronics salespeople try to get you to 
buy, such guarantees are usually not worth paying for on something as stable 
as a balanced fund, which rarely loses money. (We tell the whole story on seg-
regated funds in Chapter 19.)
 
Few funds of any sort lose money over ten years (except for the speculative 
gamblers’ funds we look at in Chapter 12), and that means the guarantee is of 
limited value. So to keep costs down and returns up, look for a global balanced 
fund with an MER lower than the median 2.36 percent.
Going global: A near-perfect investment?
If you had to invest money in a single fund for 100 years without ever moving 
it or looking at it, some kind of global balanced fund with low expenses would 
make sense. The global balanced fund has finally caught the imagination of 
Canadian investors, with the number of these funds nearly tripling between 
mid-2003 and mid-2008, with $90 billion in total assets. The majority of these 
assets, happily, are in the global neutral balanced category.
In some ways, the dull old global balanced fund is the perfect mutual fund. 
Look at the portfolio of any sophisticated, wealthy investor and it’ll almost 
certainly contain stocks all over the world plus bonds, with the safety cush-
ion of a little cash. That’s what a global balanced fund provides for the aver-
age person. It offers instant access to a professionally chosen mixture of 
investments that should produce a consistent return on their money while 
staying clear of market gambles. Nearly every major fund seller sells some 
sort of global balanced fund, and it’s a simple matter of dumping your money 
in and forgetting about it.

 Chapter 13: Balanced Funds: Boring Can Be Good
Where did all the income balanced funds go?
As inflation and interest rates tumbled in the 
1990s and stayed near historic lows for many 
years, older people who were trying to live off 
their savings have had to cope with an unpleas-
ant reality. With inflation below 3 percent, 
the rates seniors got on their GICs and other 
accounts were at a subsistence level of no 
more than 4 percent — and, as interest income, 
it’s fully taxable. That’s one of the drawbacks 
of low inflation: It leaves those who live on a 
fixed income high and dry. While inflation rose 
rapidly during the first part of 2008, few deposit 
rates were above 3 percent as of mid-2008.
The mutual fund industry has benefited from a 
huge invasion of “GIC refugees” since the mid-
1990s. The companies’ little elves figured out a 
way to deliver one of the things these people 
held dear: a nice regular cheque in the mail. 
The problem was that mutual funds aren’t really 
designed for producing a predictable spinoff 
of cash — or, at least, enough cash to satisfy 
investors, especially when companies take out 
MERs of up to 2 percent to pay the managers 
and provide forage for brokers. Finding top-
quality bonds or shares that had a high enough 
yield to satisfy everyone was hard. All the good 
stuff had been driven up to such high prices by 
other investors hungry for a stream of cash.
Thus was born the income balanced fund, an 
odd hybrid that’s usually designed not only to 
throw off plenty of interest and dividends, but 
also to gain or at least hold its value over the 
long term. For example, an income balanced 
fund might try to generate monthly payments 
of $50, or $600 a year, for an investor who held 
$10,000 worth of the fund. That’s a yield of 6 
percent annually, but some funds chase even 
higher rates of up to 9 or 10 percent. To pro-
duce this income while also holding its value in 
the face of inflation, the fund buys a mixture of 
bonds, shares, and other sorts of investments 
that pay out cash. The new fund managers 
were turned loose like hungry bears to grab and 
eat anything in the world — animal, vegetable, 
or mineral — that threw off a decent stream of 
interest or dividend payments. The shortage of 
good-quality investments producing a decent 
yield became so acute that many of these man-
agers have been obliged to move down the 
food chain. They’ve had to buy income trusts 
as well as real estate trusts and similar funds 
that invest in other stuff. These trusts are sort 
of like mutual funds themselves, but they hold a 
narrow collection of properties, such as a few 
power stations, gas wells, or other relatively 
dull and predictable businesses.
But as income balanced funds snowballed in 
number, they eventually needed to be classified 
in different ways. They’re now scattered across 
a number of categories, including Canadian div-
idend and income, Canadian income trusts, and 
the two fixed income balanced categories. See 
Chapter 16 for more on dividend and income 
funds, and income trust funds.
 
Over the short term — particularly in recent years — relying on a global bal-
anced fund to address all your investing needs might not seem so shrewd. A 
big risk attached to a global balanced fund, as with any foreign fund, is the 
possibility that Canada’s economy, and with it the loonie, will prosper rela-
tive to the United States and other countries. Well, guess what happened 
during the past few years. Right. A climbing loonie relative to foreign 

212
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
currencies slashed the value of your foreign holdings in Canadian-dollar 
terms, an unpleasant prospect for those who plan to retire in this country. 
That’s why it’s almost certainly a good idea to own Canadian assets, too.
Examining a couple of world-beaters
 
In this section we highlight a couple of high-quality investments that are unlikely 
to lead you far astray. But bear in mind that any fund can go into a slump 
because the manager made a bad call. And buying a global balanced fund is 
always a compromise, because you cannot know exactly what sort of assets 
you’ll end up owning or how precisely the manager produced his or her returns. 
A balanced fund is for investors who just want a quick, instant solution.
 
Here are a couple of global balanced funds with low MERs favoured by 
Morningstar:
 
 PH&N Balanced is a traditional balanced fund, currently classified as 
a Canadian neutral balanced fund, but would be more at home in the 
global balanced category depending on management’s outlook on for-
eign versus domestic markets. The Canadian, U.S., international, and 
bond teams are all strong and experienced, with excellent track records 
to back them up. The offering’s MER of 0.86 percent is lower than nearly 
all of its competitors and is less than the weighted-average of its compo-
nent funds.
 
 Trimark Global Balanced has managed to escape fallout from the many 
highly publicized manager departures and lagging performance that 
have put a cloud over many of Trimark’s fund offerings. But with lead 
manager Bruce Harrop still making the calls, and long-time fixed income 
manager Rex Chong riding shotgun, this fund remains in good hands. It’s 
a tad pricey though, with an MER of 2.34 percent.
Tactical Balanced Funds: Pay 
Me to Lose Your Money
Tactical balanced funds, also known as asset allocation funds, are the unruly 
younger brothers of balanced funds — given the freedom to raise hell by 
dumping all their bonds or stocks, and to chase hot returns with lopsided 
portfolios. (“Tactical” simply means that the fund makes short-term bets 
on moves in the different asset classes every few months. The conventional 
balanced fund categories, on the other hand, contain funds with strategic 
portfolios, which usually means a manager adheres to a rigid asset-allocation 
mandate over the years as required by the fund’s stated investment mandate.)

213
 Chapter 13: Balanced Funds: Boring Can Be Good
These are funds that move between different types of investments and take 
bigger risks than regular balanced funds, all in an attempt to earn fatter 
returns. For example, a fund of this type may sell nearly all of its bonds and 
seek big profits with a portfolio that’s made up almost entirely of shares. Or 
it might even move heavily into a volatile area of the stock market such as 
technology stocks. The idea is that the manager is smart and lucky enough 
to anticipate big swings in the prices of financial assets — history shows, 
though, that very few people can pull off that trick consistently.
All flash and no pan: Looking at asset 
allocation returns and management styles
The median Canadian tactical asset allocation fund posted a ten-year com-
pound annual return of only 3.3 percent as of mid-2008. That was not as good 
as the 5-percent return from the median Canadian neutral balanced fund, 
supposedly a sedate compromise between low risk and steady appreciation. 
Over five years, the tactical group put in a better showing, with a compound 
annual return of 7.1 percent at June 2008 compared with 7.9 percent for 
Canadian neutral balanced funds.
A few star performers shine among tactical balanced funds run by manag-
ers who have managed to consistently generate returns in the top half of 
the pack — including the $7-billion Fidelity Canadian Asset Allocation Fund, 
which was the top performer on a five-year compound annual basis at mid-
2008, up 11.5 percent. Other strong five-year performers include
 
 Investors Group’s Counsel Funds
 
 Empire Life Insurance Co.
 
 CI Funds
Ultimately, these funds basically represent an opportunity to watch some-
one mess around with your money. That’s fine if you trust the company and 
the warty old wizard or witch mixing up the ingredients in the cauldron, but 
remember that the less balanced a portfolio, the greater the exposure to loss 
if the main asset class goes into a slump.
Who’s running this crazy show?
Much as we’d love to portray tactical balanced fund managers as wild, blonde, 
Finnish women dressed in leather and thundering down the highway of life 
on bucking portfolios full of junk bonds and Internet stocks, in reality they’re 
pretty similar to balanced fund managers. Unassuming folk in conservative 
business attire, that is. A major fund seller is unlikely to let an asset allocation 
fund slide off the road completely because the manager took crazy bets.

214
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
In fact, the typical tactical balanced fund’s asset allocation isn’t that different 
from what you’d find in a neutral balanced fund. In mid-2008, the weighted 
average tactical balanced fund was 61 percent stocks, 25 percent bonds, and 
13 percent cash, and the Canadian neutral balanced fund mix was 53:34:11. So 
the tactical fund was not exactly providing a night of passion beside a cooling 
Harley. Moreover, the median tactical fund comes with a higher MER than its 
staid cousin — 2.47 percent versus 2.3 percent.
The bottom line on asset allocation funds: Put your money in one if you find 
regular balanced funds too boring, but get ready to pay more in fees — and 
be prepared to lose if the manager gets it wrong.

B
uying a bond means you’re lending money to the government or com-
pany that issued the thing. The word “bond” means promise, indicating 
the borrowers have given their word they’ll be around to pay interest and 
refund the loan. All you’re really entitled to get back are the periodic interest 
payments plus the return of all your money when the debt comes due.
Dull, huh? Bond funds simply hold a bunch of these loans, collecting the inter-
est cheques and cashing in the bonds when they mature. That means bond 
funds tend to plod along with modest returns, while stocks fly and crash from 
year to year. Equity (or stock market) funds, with their promise of apparently 
limitless growth, just seem so much more exciting. But remember that bonds 
along with stocks represent the two main financial assets you can invest in 
for the long term — while a little bit of cash on the side is an essential safety 
valve for nearly any portfolio.
In this chapter we explain why it’s wise to own at least one bond fund, show 
you how to pick a good one, and help you work out how much you need to 
invest in bonds.

216
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Some Great Reasons to Choose Bonds
Almost any sophisticated investor’s holdings should include a good leavening 
of bonds, because betting the whole wad on shares is just too crazy. That’s 
because it bares your entire savings to nasty losses if the stock market turns 
down. Some fund salespeople and diehard stock market players used to 
strut and boast that “I’ve never owned a bond,” but they miss out on the 
advantages bonds offer.
Offering greater security than equities
Although stocks are generally acknowledged to have better long-term perfor-
mance than bonds, surprisingly, Canadian stocks have an edge of less than a 
percentage point over domestic bonds over 25 years. The Standard & Poor’s/
Toronto Stock Exchange composite index’s 25-year compound annual return 
was 10.1 percent as of mid-2008, compared with the DEX universe bond 
index’s 9.5 percent.
 
The DEX index tracks a combination of investment-grade Canadian bonds, 
including federal, provincial, municipal, and investment-grade corporate 
bonds that mature in more than one year. Until 2007, the DEX fixed income 
indices formerly were known as the Scotia Capital indices. The indices’ owner, 
the Toronto Stock Exchange, changed the name after it began taking fixed-
income data from multiple dealers, not just Scotia. DEX is a new derivatives 
exchange being launched by the TSX and an international partner.
Bonds have done particularly well in recent years, aided by falling inflation 
and the declining interest rates that come with it. What’s more, bonds can 
provide a steadier performance. The DEX index lost money only twice during 
that 25-year span, and provided healthy returns in the each of the six years 
the S&P/TSX was in the red (see Figure 14-1).
But, numbers aside, here’s why you must own some bonds or bond funds: 
Lending your money short-term, by popping it into a bank deposit or 
account, doesn’t pay you enough. Okay, so you can invest most of your 
money in the stock market, but that’s a recipe for losing most of your pile if 
the market goes into a huge dive. So we all should leave a portion on long-
term loan to big, secure governments and companies. And the way to do that 
is to buy their bonds, which are essentially certificates representing interest-
paying loans to the corporations or governments that issued the bonds.
 
But with inflation and interest rates still with mostly nowhere to go but up 
(as of mid-2008), bonds may have trouble doing as well in the coming years. If 
inflation and rates rise, then bond prices will drop, dragging down bond funds.

Sure, equities have always bounced back in the past. But stocks can go 
into a slump for years, just as they did in the inflation-and-recession-prone 
1970s. From February 1966 to August 1982, a stretch of 16 long years, the 
Dow Jones industrial average of blue-chip U.S. stocks fell 22 percent. Yes, 
America’s blue-chip companies paid regular dividends during the period, 
reducing investors’ losses. But it was still a horrible time to be in the market, 
a depressing and endless era of new lows.
Remember Japan and the way its market hit a euphoric peak in 1989 (just 
as technology and communication stocks all over the world did in 2000)? A 
decade and a half later, the Japanese market is still a volatile, unprofitable 
place, unless you get extremely lucky playing the dangerous game of market 
timing. (Refer to Chapter 12 for more about Japan’s market woes.)
Or you might lose your job, have legal troubles, or run into some disaster 
right in the middle of a periodic stock market slump. It would be ugly to be 
forced to tap into your serious money just after it’s been carved up by a 
stock sell-off. So own some bonds. They serve as a giant, reassuring outrigger 
for your canoe, producing steady returns while holding their value.

218
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Increasing their value against deflation
Companies and individuals all over the world are getting smarter and more effi-
cient all the time and are producing goods and services at ever-lower prices. 
Inflation in most wealthy countries fell to less than 2 percent in recent years 
from double figures in the 1980s. While inflation has been on the rise lately, 
aided in large part by rapidly rising commodities prices, for a while there was 
genuine concern that we might enter an era of actual falling prices, or deflation. 
If that happened, bonds and cash would be likely to hold their value or even 
rise in price because the value of money will be rising (inflation, the opposite 
scenario, simply means that money is losing its purchasing power). In other 
words, deflation is a weird Through the Looking Glass world in which cash 
under the mattress becomes a solid investment that produces a real return.
 
Does a world of falling prices sound incredible? It’s been happening all around 
us for years in computers, where prices drop and processing power increases 
every few months. Natural resource prices were in a slump for most of the 
1990s as Russia and other poor countries flooded the market in a desperate bid 
to get U.S. dollars. Granted, an economy-wide slump in prices hasn’t happened 
since the Depression of the 1930s, so nobody knows what it would be like — or 
what would happen to equity markets. But falling prices squeeze corporate 
profit margins like a vice, and declining profits are like rat poison for stocks. 
From September 1929 to July 1932, as the Depression got going, the Dow fell 
by almost 90 percent. We wish that was a typographical error, but it’s not. The 
Dow dropped to 41 from 381. So own some bonds.
How Much Do I Need in Bonds?
Take the old rule — that your weighting in cash and bonds should equal your 
age — as a starting point. Sure, leaving a big 40 percent of one’s savings in such 
dull fixed-income stuff will seem pathetically craven to all you racy 40-year-olds 
out there. So bring it down to 30 percent, or even 25 percent if you insist. But any 
lower than that and the volatility of your portfolio — a fancy word for the yearly 
up-and-down changes in the market value of your holdings — starts going off the 
scale. In other words, if you own only stocks, you’re betting a lot of your wealth 
on swings in just one asset.
Now, all this will probably fall on deaf ears for people like Andrew, who 
weren’t playing the market in the grim days and blacker months and years 
of the 1970s. If you haven’t lived through a grinding decade-long bear market 
in stocks, you may be hazy on the value of a bond and think that stocks will 
always pull you through. But the risk of a long-term slump in equities means 
that if you’re in your 20s, it’s probably safe to hold one-fifth of your portfolio 
in bonds; in your 30s, hold one-third or less in fixed income; in your 40s, hold 
40 percent in bonds; in your 50s, hold half your dough in cash and bonds; 
and in your 60s go toward two-thirds of your portfolio in bonds.

219
 Chapter 14: Bond Funds: Boring Can Be Sexy, Too
Begin with the age rule and then take the cash-plus-bonds weighting up or 
down depending on your personality.
 
If you already have or will have another source of income, such as a company 
pension fund, then you can afford to be more aggressive with your independent 
RRSP money because it doesn’t represent your only hope. In other words, own 
more stocks.
 
Bonds are a guaranteed source of income, a mighty comforting port in the gale 
if equity markets collapse. If you’re a self-employed professional and you defi-
nitely have to generate your entire retirement income from your RRSPs and 
other savings, then the asset mix in your portfolio is of life or death impor-
tance for you. You almost certainly already have an accountant helping with 
your taxes, so get her or him to help you choose the amount of bonds in your 
portfolio or refer you to another fee-charging professional who’s knowledge-
able about financial planning (see Chapter 8).
Just about any commission-paid broker or financial planner will have an 
off-the-shelf system or software package to help you choose the amount of 
bonds to hold. Remember, as always, that the results are only as valid as 
the assumptions the program makes about inflation, interest rates, and the 
economy. Professional investors routinely get those conditions wrong, so 
no reason exists why salespeople or their systems should do any better. But 
just about everybody will tell you to put a portion of your savings into a bond 
fund. Even the aggressive Canadian Maximum Long-Term Growth package in 
Mackenzie Financial Corp.’s Star series (Star is a bunch of pre-mixed cock-
tails of Mackenzie funds) had nearly 20 percent of its assets in fixed-income 
Do I need all this boring 
bonds-versus-stocks stuff?
Financial planning and structuring a portfolio 
are not clear-cut techniques that you can just 
learn and use. Folks in the investment game 
make the whole thing even more confusing. 
They like to conjure up arcane lore and mutter 
magic spells as they unveil their latest gizmo. 
Salespeople must have something to sell, after 
all. But investment theories can’t be proved or 
disproved, in part because they depend on the 
future. And the future is always unknowable. So 
investment “research” is more like folk legend 
or articles of faith.
That means no “right” proportion of your wealth 
to have in bonds exists — if stocks surge, then 
almost any amount will seem too much because 
you’ll miss out on returns. But when stocks sink, 
you’ll get a toasty warm feeling from your bonds. 
If the inflation rate rises, then bonds and cash 
assets will steadily lose their real value. But if 
the opposite happens, and deflation hits, bonds 
may be about the only things that go up in price, 
because money will steadily gain value. Once 
again, just remember to buy a bit of every asset 
class and buy quality, and you’ll be fine.

investments in mid-2008. And that’s supposed to be a volatile mixture for 
somebody who’s sure they won’t need the money for a long time — for 
example, investors in their 30s without much left to pay on their home.
Picking a Good Bond Fund in 30 Seconds
Selecting a superior bond fund boils down to two simple rules: It should hold 
plenty of high-quality long-term bonds, and it must have low expenses. And, 
as always, favour funds with low MERs.
 
Here’s more good news: Own at least two Canadian and two global stock 
funds, because any equity manager can go into a slump for years. But you’ll 
almost certainly do fine with just one bond fund, as long as it has a low MER 
and is full of quality bonds. No big fund seller would allow its managers to 
make weird bets with a mainstream bond fund, such as buying 20-year paper 
issued by a bankrupt tin mine. The backlash from investors, the media, and 
possibly even regulators would be too great.
Insisting on affordability
In general, look only at bond funds with MERs of 1 percent or less. The funds 
with low expenses will almost all turn out to be no-load products that you 
buy directly from a bank or direct-selling fund company. That’s because fund 
companies that sell through brokers, financial planners, and other advisers 
have to add on extra charges in order to have something left over to pay 
the salespeople; expect to pay an extra 0.5 to 0.75 percent annually on most 
broker-sold bond funds.
Looking for quality in provincial 
and federal bonds
Buy a fund with plenty of high-quality, long-term federal government and pro-
vincial bonds. A few super-blue-chip company bonds are okay, but remember 
that with business changing at the speed of Bill Gates’s rubbery mind, today’s 
corporate grande-dame could be tomorrow’s bag lady. So go easy on the IBMs. 
If you’re a bit nervous that inflation might come back, you want a middle-of-the 
road solution when it comes to bonds. So just get a bond fund that matches the 
DEX universe bond index — which pretty well represents the entire Canadian 
bond market.

221
 Chapter 14: Bond Funds: Boring Can Be Sexy, Too
 
If you want a compromise, buy a plain-vanilla bond fund whose average term 
to maturity is close to the DEX universe index, which includes both short- and 
long-term bonds. Many fund companies and bond investors use the index as 
the benchmark with which they compare the performance and holdings of 
their funds.
Checking out two beautiful bond funds
 
Here are two bond fund picks from Morningstar. Although not quite vanilla, 
both have high-quality holdings, flexible mandates that may enable them to 
beat the index, and relatively low expenses:
 
 Beutel Goodman Income is one of the few options in the fixed income 
category that has a chance at beating the benchmark over the long run, 
according to analysts at Morningstar. The fund’s low fees and excellent 
manager give it a leg up on most of its peers. More recently, the fund 
has performed well through the credit crunch as manager Bruce Corneil 
adeptly steered the fund away from bank-issued bonds because of their 
lack of transparency. The fund’s MER is 0.69 percent.
 
 PH&N Total Return Bond Fund benefits hugely from the expertise of 
Phillips, Hager & North, a company known as a strong fixed-income man-
ager. PH&N has more than 20 managers and analysts assigned to this 
asset management area. With its flexible mandate and very low fees, this 
fund is one of the best fixed income funds in Canada. Other than invest-
ing in core bonds, management can use derivatives to capture value and 
add a small allocation to high-yield bonds when opportunity knocks. 
And the fund’s MER is a modest 0.58 percent.
Understanding How Inflation 
Affects Bonds
Although bonds are generally a stable investment, they do have a pair of 
mortal enemies: rising inflation and his evil henchman, rising interest rates. 
National banks generally raise interest rates when an economy starts to over-
heat, or become inflated. Those higher interest rates tend to cool things off. 
Unfortunately, they also tend to reduce the value of bonds.

222
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Rising interest rates, falling bond prices
A bond falls in value when interest rates rise, because investors are willing to 
pay less for it. To take a simple example, say you hold an 8-percent bond but 
interest rates increase so that other comparable investments, with the same 
term to maturity, are yielding 9 percent. If you try to sell your old 8-percent 
bond, you’ll have to cut the price to get anyone interested. For example, you 
might have to mark it down to 95 cents per $1 of face value (bonds always 
mature at face value or “par,” which is 100 cents on the dollar). When you 
offer the bond at 5 percent off, the buyer of your cut-price bond will get 
the regular 8-percent interest payment but they’ll also make an extra kick 
because they’ve bought it at the 5-percent discount. When the bond matures 
at its full face value of $1 per $1 face value, that’ll be enough to bring its 
annual yield up to 9 percent.
In 1999, interest rates increased sharply, mainly because the U.S. Federal 
Reserve was worried about inflation, and rising interest rates always reduce 
the market value of bonds that are out in the hands of investors. Bond funds 
were thus obliged to mark down the value of their holdings accordingly. That 
year, Canadian bond funds produced a modest average loss of 2.5 percent.
Rising inflation makes bondholders and other lenders very, very afraid 
because they become petrified of seeing the real value of their money wither 
away. So they demand higher interest rates and bond yields. That means 
they refuse to buy bonds without getting big discounts, so bond prices fall 
and you’ll make less money on your bond funds.
Falling interest rates, rising bond prices
When interest rates fall, as they’ve been doing pretty well without a break 
since the early 1980s, the picture looks brighter for bonds. If rates in the 
market drop to 7 percent, then your 8-percent bond becomes a hotcake and 
investors will be willing to buy it from you at a premium.
Interest rates fall when inflation drops because lenders become confident 
that their money won’t lose its value too fast while it’s in the hands of the 
borrowers. So they’re prepared to accept lower interest rates. About the 
only thing that’s likely to send bond prices sharply higher in coming years, 
giving bond funds more good times, will be an era of falling prices or at least 
growing confidence among investors that inflation is dead for the foreseeable 
future. In that case, bond buyers are likely to bid bonds up even higher.
Lower inflation makes bond buyers and other lenders feel more comfortable 
about tying up their money for years, so they’ll accept lower interest rates 
and bond yields. Lower rates and yields mean higher bond prices, which 
mean extra profits for your bond funds.

223
 Chapter 14: Bond Funds: Boring Can Be Sexy, Too
 
The bottom line, though, is that predicting changes in interest rates is a futile 
exercise akin to forecasting the weather. Just buy a good bond fund and view 
it as an insurance policy for your entire savings.
Index Funds and Bonds: A Marriage 
Made in Heaven
A bond fund should be like a holiday in upstate New York. Cheap and dull. So 
index funds with their low expenses and dreary habit of tracking the whole 
market are just the ticket. In the United States, index bond funds that simply 
match the market are by far the most common method of investing in bonds. 
Index funds, you’ll recall, are funds that match a well-known market bench-
mark. In Canada, index bond funds usually track the DEX index. In the United 
States, index fund giant Vanguard sells funds whose annual expenses go 
down as low as 0.2 percent — that’s only one-fifth of a percent. The median 
Canadian fixed income fund, by contrast, charges nearly 1.5 percent. Alas, a 
Canadian resident cannot buy U.S.–based mutual funds, although some inves-
tors have been known to open an account from a U.S. address and/or using a 
U.S. discount broker to do this.
 
You can, however, buy a low-fee Canadian bond index fund from a bank. 
Better still, consider iShares’ fixed-income ETFs. The iShares Universe Bond 
Index’s MER is just 0.3 percent. The cheapest bank-sponsored bond fund is 
Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Canadian Bond E class, at 0.48 percent. See 
more on exchange-traded and index funds in Chapter 15; also check out www.
shares.com.
Long Bonds: Grabbing 
the Lion by the Tail
Long-term bonds are those with maturity dates five years or more in the future. 
They are generally regarded as being more risky than short-term fixed-income 
securities because of the uncertainty of the future direction of interest rates. In 
exchange for this risk, they tend to provide a better long-term rate of return.
Unfortunately, no clear rules force managers to disclose to the public how 
long-term their bond portfolios are, but many companies voluntarily compare 
their holdings to the DEX universe index. Bond managers revel in bizarre for-
mulas, and one of their favourites is “duration,” which measures how much a 
bond or portfolio of bonds will drop when interest rates rise. A duration of six 
years and higher is generally aggressive, while five and down is conservative. 

224
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Aggressive bond managers are betting that interest rates will fall or at least 
stay stable. So if you’re really worried that inflation will come back, seek out a 
manager who holds lots of short bonds.
Why you may want to rule out 
long-term bond funds
 
Short-term bonds, those with five or fewer years to run, are less vulnerable 
to rises in interest rates and inflation. Why? Because the time they have left 
is so brief that investors don’t mind tying up their money in them. An instru-
ment with 30 years left to run on it looks far worse when rates rise. (We look 
at short-term bond funds in the section “Playing It Safe with Short-Term Bond 
Funds” in this chapter.)
Managers of bond funds, like their flashier stock-picking colleagues, love to 
dress up their rather monotonous jobs with fancy-sounding strategies and 
jargon. But running a bond fund basically involves deciding how much risk 
you’re going to take and then buying the bonds that suit that strategy. Bond 
managers buy as many long-dated bonds as they dare. Investors who can’t 
handle that kind of risk should turn to the next type of fund, which concen-
trates on short-term bonds with fewer than five years to run before they 
retire. (Wouldn’t it be nice to quit in five years!)
Why you may want to consider 
long-term bond funds
 
Why should you look for long-term bonds? If you have a home mortgage, you 
probably know that in recent years the best thing to do as a borrower has 
been to keep renewing your mortgage for short terms at low rates instead of 
“locking in” for a longer term at a higher rate. But for lenders, such as buyers 
of a bond fund, the opposite strategy has been better. Lending long, by buying 
long-term bonds with ten or more years to run before they mature, has been 
the most lucrative approach because short-term interest rates kept dropping. 
Now the next ten years may be different, but just buy a plain bond fund that’s 
got plenty of long-term Canadian government bonds.
For the serious money portion of your portfolio, avoid risky “high-yield” bond 
funds or sleepwalking “short-term” bonds (more on those later in this chapter). 
The rule you apply should be this: Bet long-term as a lender because that’s 
where the yield is. An old saying in the bond market is: Be long or be wrong. 
Longer-term bonds usually pay you more interest but they also drop the most 
when interest rates go up, and they gain in price more quickly when interest 
rates decline.

225
 Chapter 14: Bond Funds: Boring Can Be Sexy, Too
Playing It Safe with Short-Term 
Bond Funds
Funds in the short-term fixed income category are the funds to buy with 
money you’d like to have cruise along, earning steady single-digit returns and 
not being exposed to too much risk. The short-term fixed income category is 
defined as including funds that invest in investment-grade bonds and other 
debt securities with an average duration of 3.5 years or less. Most individual 
short-term funds’ mandates specify they hold only securities with maturity 
dates no more than five years in the future. To be classified in this category, 
these funds must have less than 25 percent of their portfolios in high-yield 
bonds. Some funds in this category hold residential mortgages.
These are the sort of funds a church might buy with money being saved up 
for a new roof. Nice and stable (the fund, not the old roof), but flexible and 
offering higher returns than a money market fund at the cost of slightly more 
risk. (Money market funds, the safest type of all, are an excellent place to hold 
the cash portion of your savings. Usually they hold nothing but very short-
term loans to the government and big companies. We offer more about them 
in Chapter 17.)
Getting to know short-term bond funds
Short-term, fixed-income funds are almost entirely invested in government 
bonds with fewer than five years left before maturity. Corporate bonds may 
show up in these funds, but they should be from big-brother companies that 
you’ve heard of, like Bell Canada. The main holdings should all be from the 
federal government and provinces. But not too much from smaller provinces — 
they’re great places, but they tend to have lower credit ratings. Not that much 
risk of default exists in bonds to those provinces, but in the bond market, per-
ception is everything. A lower credit rating becomes a leaden factor in itself, 
dragging a bond down to lower prices.
Funds that focus on residential mortgages are even more stable than short-
term bond funds, so they fit in just next to money market funds. They hold 
huge quantities of mortgages that have been packaged by math nerds work-
ing at a bank in downtown Toronto, who then also calculate a fee to help 
keep the bank in the comfortable style to which it’s accustomed. The disad-
vantage of these funds is that they lack the simplicity of funds that stick to 
bonds. A fund might not be able to find mortgages to buy at decent yields, 
but bonds are always for sale.

226
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Comparing short-term fixed income 
funds to money market funds
In the ten years to mid-2008, the median fund in the Canadian short-term fixed 
income category produced an average annual return of 3.7 percent, slightly 
better than what you’d have with a money market fund. Mortgage funds have 
dwindled in number in recent years, and now are categorized in one of the 
fixed-income categories, mostly in short-term. No matter, as these funds, along 
with money market funds, tend to load up on short-term, high-quality debt 
investments.
Mortgage and short-term bond funds are different from money market funds 
in one important way: Mortgage and short-term bond funds are true mutual 
funds, meaning that their units can drop below a fixed price — in other 
words, you can lose money. Money market funds are more like a form of 
savings account than a real fund because they’re pretty well eternally held 
at their $10 unit price. Your return from a money market fund comes only in 
the form of cash or extra units, whereas short-term bond funds or mortgage 
funds both pay out distributions — and mark their units up in value when 
interest rates fall, and mark them down when rates rise.
In reality, though, all three types of funds are pretty darn stable. Since the 
late 1980s, none of these funds has lost money over a full calendar year, 
although short-term fixed-income funds came close in 1994, when interest 
rates rose sharply and the median fund in this category merely broke even. 
That was much more palatable than the fate of the median Canadian long-
term fixed-income fund, which fell more than 9 percent.
Checking out a couple short-term 
bond fund winners
 
Here are two short-term bond funds that Morningstar likes:
 
 iShares CDN DEX Short Term Bond Index is a passively managed ETF, 
which means it simply tracks the relevant index, with no active invest-
ment decisions made to try to better the index’s return. It sports the 
lowest MER in the Canadian short-term bond category at 0.25 percent. 
The expected return of this conservative category is not very high, so 
fees play a much larger role in performance. This low fee makes it a 
tough option to beat.
 
 PH&N Short Term Bond and Mortgage is one of the least expensive 
options (next to the ETF) in the Canadian short-term fixed income cat-
egory. Its MER is 0.61 percent. The fund also has the backing of one of 
the most highly regarded fixed-income managers in Canada.

High-Yield Bond Funds: Naked 
Bungee-Jumping
Brokers and investment managers like to call bonds issued by less-than-blue-chip 
companies in unstable industries such as media or minerals “high yield,” because 
buyers demand fat interest rates before they’ll touch them with a kilometre-long 
pole. “High yield” sounds nice and healthy, doesn’t it? Sort of like it’s full of fibre, 
dried fruit, and tasty bits of soy. But American investors have long used the cor-
rect term for such concoctions: “junk.”
In other words, in the bond market you get what you pay for, and to achieve 
more yield you have to go down the quality scale. That involves buying riskier 
bonds from smaller companies — obscure stuff that’s often hard to sell at any 
price if the bond market turns down sharply.
For example, during the global financial panic in the summer of 1998, bonds 
from even the biggest global corporations became difficult to trade as inves-
tors fled to the safety of government securities. Finding buyers for your junk 
bonds was like trying to sell lemon juice to hummingbirds.
Some funds in the junk group also hold safe-as-houses government bonds, 
but they’re included in the high-yields because they’re also free to juice their 
yields by grabbing riskier stuff as well.
Considering the strikes against 
high-yield bond funds
Junk bond funds are vulnerable in times of investor paranoia and economic 
jitters, when just about everyone seeks out government bonds and shares 
in big, relatively safe companies — a panicky rush for the exits known as a 
“flight to quality.” When stock markets fall, junk bonds tend to do the same.
In other words, corporate and junk bonds have a habit of suffering just like 
stocks when recession threatens — unlike government bonds, which tend to 
go up because anxious investors reckon the government guarantee means 
they’ll always get their money back. After all, bad economic times increase 
the pressure on small or debt-laden companies, making it more likely that 
they’ll be forced to renege on their debts, including the hand-knit cozy junk 
bonds they issued.

228
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Investigating high-yield 
bond funds in Canada
In the U.S., hundreds of billions of dollars have been invested in mutual funds 
that hold junk bonds, with generally good results and attractive returns. But 
in the U.S., investors can buy from a huge number of junk bonds, making it 
easy to build diversified funds full of the things. And a diversified fund, hold-
ing dozens of junk bonds from different issuers, spreads the risk of disas-
trous defaults in any one industry.
In Canada, publicly traded junk bonds are far rarer because our cautious 
pension funds and other investors usually insist on a high credit rating. In 
the past, riskier borrowers have been forced to sell their junk south of the 
border. A few mutual fund companies, though, have launched Canadian and 
foreign junk funds in recent years.
The record of the Canadian high-yield funds is too short to predict how well 
they’ll do over the long term. But lately, junk bonds have shown their usual 
tendency to slip in price when speculative shares fall and investors get ner-
vous. Add to that the impact of the credit crisis. The median high-yield bond 
fund lost 1.9 percent during the one-year period ended June 2008, compared 
with a 5.2-percent gain by the median Canadian fixed income fund.
Determining whether high-yield 
bond funds are for you
Deciding whether the bigger potential returns from high-yield funds compensate 
for the extra risk is up to you. But even the most fervent advocates of junk prob-
ably wouldn’t advise you to risk all your bond money in high-yield debt. And 
your portfolio will do just fine if you shop elsewhere and simply stick to bond 
funds that hold only top-quality government and corporate bonds. After all, your 
stocks are risky enough, so why hold a bunch of dangerous bonds as well?
Buying Bonds Outside Canada
We’d love to tell you that your Canadian bond fund will provide the long-term 
stability and steady returns your portfolio requires, but we’d be wrong. A 
strong case exists for buying a fund that holds global bonds — a category 

229
 Chapter 14: Bond Funds: Boring Can Be Sexy, Too
that used to be called “U.S. bonds” because the funds so often end up invest-
ing in the almighty greenback. Most of these funds still have one-fifth of their 
portfolios in U.S. securities. It stands to reason that you need a U.S. bond 
fund in case a multi-year scenario occurs in which worldwide stock prices 
and the Canadian dollar both go down but bonds hold their value — in that 
case, foreign bonds will be the thing to own. So, unfortunately, for a complete 
portfolio you probably need to add a non-Canadian foreign bond as well. 
That’s why we include them in the suggested portfolios in Chapter 4, but 
there we limit global bonds to just 10 percent of the total holdings.
 
If you’re nervous about the prospects for Canada and the Canadian dollar, 
then switch money from the Canadian bond funds to the global bond funds to 
increase your insurance coverage. Yes, it’s yet another asset class, so adding 
it to your holdings will reduce overall volatility. But it also adds more com-
plexity, expense, and fiddly stuff to worry about. Bear in mind, though, that as 
of mid-2008 the median global fixed income fund had nearly half its portfolio in 
North American issues.
 
Fund sellers sometimes claim you need a foreign bond fund to give you cur-
rency diversification and protection against a collapse in the Canadian dollar. 
But you get the same sort of insurance from your global stock holdings, which, 
of course, are also priced in foreign currencies. That’s why you need invest 
only a small portion of your portfolio in foreign bonds.
Diversification at a high cost
Holding global bonds instead of global stocks comes at a price, however. The 
median global fixed income fund sold in Canada has a hefty 2 percent MER, 
compared with less than 1.5 percent for a Canadian fixed income fund. That 
hefty price tag helps these funds underperform their Canadian counterparts. 
The median fund in the group had an unimpressive 1.3 percent compound 
annual return over the ten years to mid-2008. Canadian fixed income funds 
managed 4.6 percent.
Stinging losses posted by foreign bond funds in 1999 left the average fund 
down a spine-chilling 10.4 percent. That wasn’t the fault of the managers: It 
was a lousy year for bonds worldwide as interest rates rose. Meanwhile, a 
slide in many European currencies relative to the Canadian dollar added to 
the losses.

230
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
A couple of recommended 
global bond funds
 
The analysts at Morningstar like a couple of global bond funds with annual 
expenses below the group average of 2.2 percent:
 
 RBC Global Bond has an intriguing mix of foreign government bonds, 
emerging markets debt, and high-yield securities. Its portfolio managers 
are free to make sector allocations, geographical shifts, and duration calls 
in an attempt to add value. They can also make currency overlay trades, 
but the fund’s default policy is to have its foreign currency exposure fully 
hedged. The performance has been solid, and its 1.71 percent MER is well 
below the category median.
 
 AGF Global Government Bond invests in bonds issued or guaranteed by 
sovereign governments, with the management team actively managing 
the foreign currency exposure. Some manager turnover has dampened 
the fund’s appeal, but it can still be a decent option for fixed income and 
currency diversification. It has a reasonable MER of 1.9 percent.

ver notice how things seem to be getting much larger? Monster mansions 
dot the landscape, movies last for hours, teenagers tower, and men’s 
razors are as wide as shovels. Well, one of the most effective and profitable 
investing techniques to emerge in recent years is also a huge idea. It’s index-
ing: buying a little of every single significant stock or bond in the market and 
just holding it, as opposed to trying to pick which one will go up and which 
will go down. The name comes from the fact that portfolios managed using this 
method aim to track a given market index or benchmark. To do that, they buy 
each stock or bond in the index. For example, a fund designed to follow the 
Standard & Poor’s/Toronto Stock Exchange composite index will buy all (or 
virtually all) of the shares in Canada’s main stock index. Mutual funds that use 
the technique are called index funds.
In this chapter we look at index funds and their doppelganger, exchange-
traded funds (ETFs), discovering what they are, why they’re a great place to 
put a lot (but not all) of your mutual fund money, and where to buy them.

232
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Buying the Whole Enchilada: The Ups 
and Downs of Index Funds
The whole idea behind index and exchange-traded funds — giving up on trying 
to pick the best stocks and just betting on the whole market — runs counter 
to human nature, of course. We all want to believe in the hero fund manager, 
the Druid who can peer into the entrails of the market and decide which stocks 
will thrive. So the fund companies run huge ads and the news media produce 
fawning stories about how wonderfully perceptive and percipient these stock 
wizards are. But it’s a myth: Managers who can be relied on to beat the market 
over many years are as rare as vegetarian leopards. And even if they do exist, 
determining in advance which ones will succeed is essentially impossible.
Exploring why index funds and ETFs 
are great for you
People who invest in index funds or ETFs are often passionate about their 
chosen vehicle, and will loudly espouse their many virtues.
They outperform most actively managed funds
Because few managers fail to beat the market over many years, index funds 
are an excellent way to go for ordinary investors. With an index or exchange-
traded fund, you don’t have to worry whether you made the right choice of 
manager, because all the fund tries to do is match the market. It doesn’t buy 
and sell stocks or bonds in pursuit of profits, but simply buys the shares or 
bonds that make up a particular index and holds them forever. A computer 
could run the thing. These funds make stock-picking expertise irrelevant. 
That’s great for busy people who don’t have the time or knowledge to check 
a manager’s credentials and find out whether his or her track record was 
achieved through luck or skill.
Making money in the stock market is a gamble. But it’s a casino in which your 
long-term chances are excellent, because good companies grow their profits 
and share prices over the years. And you improve your odds even more by 
simply buying an index fund that tracks the whole market — because these 
big suckers, the successful companies like financial combine harvester Power 
Corp. of Canada or network empire Cisco Systems, actually become the 
whole market. And it’s good to know that with an index fund, you own them.

233
 Chapter 15: Index Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds
They’re low-cost
Index and exchange-traded funds have another shining virtue: They’re cheap 
for an investor to own. No research is involved in just buying every stock in 
the market (although to hear some index funds types pontificate, you’d think it 
was the hardest thing in the world), so most index funds in Canada have a man-
agement expense ratio, or MER, of 1 percent or less. In other words, if you have 
$10,000 sitting in an index fund, you can expect to pay less than $100 (that is, 
1 percent of your money) in fees and costs each year. If an index fund’s MER 
is any higher than 1 percent, the concept starts to unravel, because it runs the 
risk of failing to keep up with the index that gives it its name.
 
Even cheaper are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are virtually the same 
as an index mutual fund except they’re traded on a stock exchange rather than 
bought from and redeemed with a fund company. MERs range from a negligi-
ble 0.15 percent for iShares S&P 500 Fund to 1 percent for Claymore Financial 
Monthly Income Fund. We talk more about ETFs later in this chapter.
Normal non-index mutual funds — which do try to select particular stocks 
and bonds in an effort to turn a profit — are known as actively managed 
funds. They’re far more expensive to own. The MER of the median Canadian 
equity mutual fund (active and passive funds included) is about 2.3 percent, 
which means the typical actively managed fund rakes off considerably more 
in fees and costs than an index fund. And that extra 1.3 percentage points is a 
lot — over 20 years, it adds up to nearly one-third of your money.
They’re great for taxable accounts
Index funds expose you to very little in taxation until you cash them in, 
making them a great way to defer taxation.
Nearly all mutual funds pay distributions to their unitholders — cash pay-
ments that most people choose to take in the form of more units of the fund 
(so the investment continues to compound and grow). Funds make the dis-
tributions when they have trading profits or interest (and dividend) income 
that the manager wants to pay out to the fund’s investors.
Say you hold 1,000 units of a fund at the end of the year and the unit value is 
$10, for a total investment of $10,000. The fund manager generated $1 of trad-
ing profits per unit during the year and pays this out to the unitholders. The 
value of each unit drops by $1, reflecting the payment that has been made. 
You now hold your original 1,000 units, which are worth $9 each, for a total 
of $9,000. But you’ve also received $1,000 in the distribution, which you can 
take in cash or new units, bringing you back to $10,000.

234
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
No matter how you receive the units, though, you’re liable for tax on the 
distribution, just as if you had earned it trading stocks on your own. Some 
funds whose managers trade a lot can make very large distributions. Note, 
though, that getting distributions isn’t a problem if you hold the fund in a tax-
deferred account such as a registered retirement savings plan, which lets you 
delay paying taxes on the money you earn within the account. (We talk more 
about taxes in Chapter 23 and about RRSPs in Chapter 22.)
Index funds just buy and hold the stocks in the index and they do very little 
trading. So they tend to pay out very little in the way of distributions. That 
makes them especially suitable for taxable accounts — money that isn’t held 
in an RRSP or other tax-deferred account.
Delving into the dark side of 
index funds and ETFs
No magic bullet exists in investing, and index and exchange-traded funds 
carry their own dangers. The big hazard is that the stock market indexes 
themselves — those seemingly logical benchmarks that these funds follow — 
often become dominated by just a few high-priced companies. In turn, that 
means the funds that track those benchmarks become risky investments 
because they’re tied to the fortunes of just a few companies.
In recent years, stock market indexes have been dominated by high-priced 
growth stocks such as Nortel Networks Corp. or General Electric Corp. that 
left the rest of the market behind. Growth stocks are companies whose sales 
and profits are expanding rapidly. If investors decide that the companies can 
go on increasing their revenues and earnings for years, then they’ll bid the 
shares up to high prices. But any sign of a slowdown in a company’s growth 
is likely to make its stock price drop like a rock.
At one point Nortel represented more than 30 percent of the S&P/TSX com-
posite index. That meant an investor in an S&P/TSX index or exchange-traded 
fund had one-third of his or her portfolio in a single stock — a very risky bet. 
The same was true, to a lesser extent, of the U.S. market, where a handful of 
companies such as GE made up a huge chunk of the market. So index and 
exchange-traded funds inevitably had a huge proportion of their assets in a 
few soaring giant companies. Many of the index funds, in other words, had 
turned into high-risk, high-priced investments as opposed to cautious mir-
rors of the whole market. Then came the tumble. Of course, the potential 
nightmare that a dominant stock might crash came true, as Nortel’s share 
price collapsed. GE’s shares also plummeted.

235
 Chapter 15: Index Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds
So, did index funds and ETFs crash and burn compared with regular funds? The 
short answer is that they often got whacked harder as growth stocks dropped, 
but their medium-term returns were still respectable. More important, the Nortel 
debacle prompted the Toronto Stock Exchange, in 2001, to produce capped 
indexes, which limit the impact of any one stock on an index by restricting a 
stock’s percentage position in an index to 10 percent. One-fifth of a portfolio is 
not as dominant as one-third, true, but it’s still quite a bit. So — no matter how 
good they may sound — don’t put all your stock market money into one index 
fund or ETF. If the handful of giant stocks that dominate an index turn downward 
suddenly, your portfolio will take a beating.
 
The essence of wise investing is spreading your risk among a wide variety of 
holdings. Of the money you’ve set aside for equity funds, at most two-thirds 
should be in pure index funds or ETFs.
Fitting Index Funds into Your Portfolio
Treat index funds and ETFs as you would fruit and vegetables: They’re great 
for you and they should make up most of your diet, but eat other stuff as 
well. In other words, these funds offer many advantages, so put lots in your 
portfolio — but consider keeping at least one-third of your stock market 
money in conventional actively managed funds.
The same caution doesn’t apply to bond funds, however. “Growth” bonds 
don’t exist — a bond is simply a loan, traded among investors, with a fixed 
rate of interest and period of time before it gets paid back. Because its terms 
and features are set in advance, a bond is known as a fixed-income invest-
ment. And because bonds are so safe and stable, the average return you get 
from a bond or bond mutual fund will almost certainly be lower over sev-
eral years than the return from a stock or equity fund. But every portfolio 
should include some bonds, in the interest of stability, and you can safely go 
ahead and put all the money you’ve set aside for bonds into two bond index 
funds, one for Canadian bonds and one for foreign bonds (although very few 
choices exist for the latter).
 
Bonds are ideally suited for index funds, mainly because low expenses are so 
vital in fixed-income investing.
 
Ideally, bonds and bond funds — including bond index funds — should be 
held inside an RRSP or tax-deferred plan because they throw off lots of interest 
income each year. As with an equity fund that pays lots of capital gains distribu-
tions, if you have to pay tax on all those interest payouts, your after-tax return 
could be slashed. Better to let them pile up tax-free inside the RRSP. Most 
Canadian bond index funds simply match the entire bond market by tracking 
the DEX universe bond index. See Chapter 14 for much more on bond funds.

Evaluating Regular Mutual Fund 
and Index Fund Performance
But where’s the evidence showing that regular mutual funds just can’t beat 
the market? After all, those clever fund managers with shiny, well-scrubbed 
faces and expensive degrees can’t be simply wasting their time, can they? 
The numbers seem to show that many of them are. As of mid-2008, only a 
dozen or so actively managed funds in the Canadian equity category had 
managed to outperform the S&P/TSX composite index in each of the three-, 
five- and ten-year periods, compounded annually. And just five earned that 
distinction over 20 years.
As you can see from Figures 15-1, 15-2, and 15-3, which compare calendar-
year returns for the median Canadian, global, and U.S. equity funds and their 
respective indexes, actively managed funds have trouble keeping up in rising 
markets, although in down markets they sometimes come out ahead. U.S. 
equity managers have had a particularly tough time keeping up with their 
benchmark, the Standard & Poor’s 500 composite index.

Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
Unfortunately, it’s almost impossible for index fund fans to keep things simple 
and just buy a global equity index fund. Fund companies usually already offer 
a U.S. index fund, so they normally sell an international equity index fund that 
tracks stocks in countries outside North America. That means you have to buy 
three stock market index funds: one for Canada, one for the U.S., and one for 
international stocks. (For the record, a number of European index funds exist 
as well, along with a handful of Asian and emerging markets index funds.)
 
Want an easy and fast place to buy index funds? Pop in to a bank branch and 
use the bank’s index funds. The institution will be happy to deal in its own 
funds. You can hold your actively managed funds — which try to buy and sell 
stocks and bonds instead of tracking the whole market — in another account 
at a discount broker.
Understanding Why Fund Managers 
Seldom Beat the Market
Grasping the idea that no human being can develop the skill to consistently 
beat the stock market is tough. People naturally want to believe they’ll 
improve their chances by handing the money over to an expert. History 
shows, however, that hardly anyone manages to stay ahead of the pack year 
after year.
Many people don’t care about who will be running their money, and they 
simply put it in the first equity, balanced, and bond funds their salesperson 
suggests. Weirdly, it’s possible these investors do better than those who 
assiduously hunt out top-performing managers — because the hot managers 
so often tend to flop the next year as their favourite stocks go out of fashion.
But why is it so difficult for most fund managers to beat the stock market?
Balancing wins and losses
Fund managers don’t just trade in the stock market — they are the market. 
For every winner who beats the index and earns a profit, there has to be 
a loser to supply those profits. Yes, some of the losers may be small retail 
investors (or so the pros would like us to believe), but the institutional inves-
tors that dominate stock trading have their share of losers too. Economists 
argue endlessly on this point, but it seems clear that the stock market is ulti-
mately a zero-sum game, or at least resembles one. It’s sort of like a bunch of 
aging, flabby, boomer lads getting together to play poker on a Friday night. 
If Laurie walks away with $500, then Al or Rob or Justin is going to be down 
that much.

239
 Chapter 15: Index Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds
Money managers, believe it or not, are responsible souls who don’t want 
their unitholders to be dragged over the hot coals unduly. So they often 
shy away from loading their funds to the gunwales with the extremely hot 
stocks that are driving the indexes higher. Remember the advice in the 
Monty Python sketch about the dirty fork in the restaurant? “Never kill a 
customer.” It’s just not good for business. History shows that the public will 
accept mediocre performance, sometimes for years, but it won’t take kindly 
to losses. Increasingly in recent years, the stock market itself has become 
an insane place, and managers have had trouble keeping up with the index 
because they cautiously refused to go along with the madness.
Paying for active management
With the median Canadian equity mutual fund charging its unitholders 2.3 
percent a year in fees and expenses, it’s virtually impossible for managers 
to close the gap between them and the market. That MER is a yawning gap, 
especially when you’re trying to compensate for it every year. That gives a 
natural advantage to index funds, with their MERs of typically 1 percent or 
less. (Some, from companies such as Toronto-Dominion Bank’s E-class index 
funds, which are sold online only, are below 0.5 percent. And, of course, 
some exchange-traded funds charge even less. Now we’re talking.)
Mutual funds have another hidden expense that’s higher for actively managed 
funds: brokerage commissions. A fund that’s constantly buying and selling 
stocks is naturally going to end up paying more to brokers.
Why your fund manager isn’t a monkey playing darts
The Wall Street Journal runs a famous stock-
picking contest in which market experts are 
invited to compete with each other and with 
darts that are simply pitched at a list of shares. 
Folklore has it that the darts usually win, but in 
fact the Journal reports the experts actually 
have outperformed the darts. How come? We 
asked Burton Malkiel, professor of economics 
at Princeton University and author of A Random 
Walk Down Wall Street — and one of the godfa-
thers of indexing. The courtly Professor Malkiel 
came up with two reasons for the darts’ poor 
showings. First, the U.S. market contains thou-
sands upon thousands of sad-sack, no-hope, 
tiny stocks. The darts, with nothing to guide 
them, often fell on one of those forgotten losers, 
whereas the human stock jockeys selected real 
companies with at least some prospects. His 
other explanation: When the Journal reported 
that a prominent expert had selected a stock 
in the contest, that news alone was enough to 
push the share price higher, giving the experts’ 
stocks a leg up compared with the darts’ selec-
tions. Incidentally, Professor Malkiel wrote in 
1973 that a blindfolded monkey throwing darts 
at the stock page would do just as well as pro-
fessional money managers. In its contest, the 
Journal got reporters to throw the darts. The 
paper considered using real monkeys, but, as 
reporter Georgette Jasen put it, “various hand-
wringers have so far prevailed with concerns 
about things like liability insurance.”

Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Why Most Salespeople Hate 
Index Funds and ETFs
Almost all brokers and planners don’t like index funds because they don’t pay 
them much or anything in the way of commissions. It’s that simple. Well, that 
and the fact that an investment adviser traditionally has been expected to actu-
ally beat the market, which of course your basic index fund or ETF cannot do.
A guideline in the fund industry for equity and balanced funds is that the sales 
channel — that is, stockbrokers or financial planners — gets 1 percent of the 
client’s money each year. They may get it through a commission paid by the 
investor or the fund company at the time of purchase. Or the salesperson may 
get this commission annually in the form of a regular “trailer fee,” an annual 
sales commission paid by the fund company.
Index funds are an exception because, with their rock-bottom annual expense 
ratios of 1 percent or less, they can afford to pay little or nothing in commissions 
to salespeople. The fees just aren’t high enough. So guess what? Be prepared if 
an adviser gives you a long speech explaining why index funds aren’t that great 
after all. A fund salesperson is more likely to try to sell you on how you’ll be 
better off buying an actively managed fund run by a reassuring-looking fellow 
who’s known for his saint-like devotion to achieving high returns at low risk. The 
MER? Oh, never mind about that. It’s the return that matters, silly.
Index funds: A good idea Canadians dislike
Only a few Canadians have purchased index 
funds, partly because the idea is so, well, 
strange. Ranking all the global, international, 
and domestic equity funds in Canada by size 
as of mid-2008 showed that the 250 or so big-
gest funds were all actively managed, with only 
one notable exception: the giant iShares Large 
Cap 60 Fund, Canada’s oldest and by far largest 
exchange-traded fund, which had nearly $10 
billion in assets in mid-2008. ETFs aside, the big-
gest traditionally structured index fund at that 
time was the $910-billion TD Canadian Index. 
That was smaller than a host of drab money 
market, balanced, and monthly income funds.
So why is the cherished notion of using a tal-
ented stock picker, a magician who knows 
which shares to buy, so hard to shake? Why do 
Canadians shy away from what seems like such 
a great investment opportunity? Maybe it’s a 
cultural thing, but Canadians traditionally have 
been reluctant to pay for investment advice on 
an annual fee basis or in the form of an hourly 
fee. They would rather get hand-holding from 
a commission-paid mutual fund salesperson. 
But a problem exists right there: Such advis-
ers have a powerful incentive to recommend 
actively managed funds rather than index funds. 
Index funds are sold almost exclusively by the 
banks, and as such are no-load products, which 
normally do not remunerate commissioned 
salespeople.

241
 Chapter 15: Index Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds
Yes, some fund marketers offer index funds through salespeople. But their 
expenses are generally high, at 2 percent and up. Or the index fund is sold 
in an F-class or other adviser-sold format, in which the MER is known but 
you pay the salesperson a separate fee, usually calculated as a percentage of 
your portfolio’s dollar value. Of course, nothing’s wrong with that — as long 
as you recognize you’re paying more than if you simply bought a bank index 
fund, or perhaps an ETF through a discount brokerage.
 
If your broker or financial planner refuses to sell you an index fund or an ETF, 
then strongly consider moving your account elsewhere. So much evidence 
suggests these funds are a great deal for retail investors. Any salesperson who 
refuses to carry them is being unfair to his or her clients.
Buying Index Funds and ETFs
Even though index funds supposedly simplify the experience of buying 
mutual funds, enabling you to skirt selecting the best fund manager, you do 
have some decisions to make. Which index should you follow? Should you 
buy an index fund or an ETF? And where should you buy? Read this section, 
and all will be revealed.
Selecting the right index
The problem of which index an index fund should use is thorny and difficult. 
On the one hand, if you start guessing which index is the best one to match, 
then you’re getting close to picking stocks again, and this is the antithesis 
of passive investing. On the other hand, if you just let things go and blindly 
match a narrow index such as the S&P/TSX 60, which includes only Canadian 
stocks with very large market capitalizations, or one that’s ruled by a few 
Passive aggressive
Jargon abounds in the world of indexing. 
Because index funds aim to match the whole 
market, or an important benchmark, by simply 
buying and holding everything, the strategy is 
often called passive. In contrast, traditional 
funds, whose managers try to buy the stocks 
they think are going up and dump those they 
believe are dropping, are known as actively 
managed or active funds.
The debate between proponents of passive 
investing (who simply buy and hold the index) 
and active stock pickers will probably never 
be resolved. But we think indexing has enough 
clearly demonstrated advantages to make it a 
suitable strategy for your “core” equity money.
How’s that for a fairly active recommendation 
of a passive investing style?

242
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
high-fliers, then your index fund has arguably become an aggressive and vola-
tile fund. However, this problem doesn’t have a simple answer: Just follow 
the advice in this book and keep index funds to a maximum of two-thirds 
of your equity funds. That way, if the big stocks in the index turn out to be 
bubbles that burst painfully, a good chunk of your money will be in regular 
funds as well.
In the U.S. market, the safest policy would be to buy a super-broad index 
fund, one that tracks the huge Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, 
which contains just about every stock in America that’s worth buying. CIBC’s 
U.S. index fund tracks the Wilshire, so it would be a good choice. But it seems 
pretty certain that the better-known S&P 500, which is dominated by fewer 
and larger companies, will remain the main yardstick for the U.S. market for 
years to come. U.S. equity index funds are as cheap as Canadian ones, for the 
most part.
Most global equity index funds track the venerable MSCI world index, while 
international equity index funds track the MSCI Europe Australasia Far East 
(EAFE) index. You’d expect index funds based on overseas indexes to have 
higher MERs than their North American counterparts, but some in fact have 
very low MERs, such as TD’s offerings.
Choosing between index funds and ETFs
ETFs are favoured by investors who want to work with an investment adviser 
and who tend to have larger portfolios. Index funds are better for do-it-
yourselfers because they mostly are no-load funds and thus not normally 
within the adviser’s product domain. ETFs are bought and sold like stocks, so 
commissions are payable on each transaction. Thus they’re less suited than 
index funds to smaller investors who are building a portfolio and like to make 
frequent purchases. But the most significant difference between index funds 
and ETFs, of course, is the latter have lower MERs.
Knowing where to buy
If you want to buy an index fund with a truly low MER, you’ll have to go to the 
banks. (They are also sold by life insurance companies in the segregated fund 
format, although many of these charge sales fees and, being seg funds, have 
higher MERs. We talk more about seg funds in Chapter 19.) Banks sell index 
funds on a no-load basis directly to the public. Every discount broker should 
carry at least one family of index funds, with no hassles.

243
 Chapter 15: Index Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds
ETFs are available only from investment dealers that are members of the 
stock exchange on which a particular ETF is listed. Although their MERs are 
extremely low, as exchange-traded securities, you must pay to buy and sell 
them. Many advisers include these transaction costs in an annual advisory 
fee based on the value of the investor’s assets under administration.
 
If you’re with a financial planner or broker who doesn’t offer index funds or 
ETFs, nothing’s stopping you from opening a separate index fund account at 
a bank and holding the rest of your money with your adviser. Each of the big 
bank-owned discount brokers has index funds available, usually from the bank 
that owns the firm. The simplicity and relatively clear account statements 
offered by discount brokers make them perfect for holding index funds, espe-
cially if you can avoid the fees that some discounters impose for buying and 
selling other companies’ no-load funds. If the discounter is bank-owned, then 
the bank’s own index funds will be free of fees.
Considering some winning 
index funds and ETFs
 
Here are three great low-cost funds that invest in Canadian stocks, Canadian 
bonds, and U.S. equities, as selected by analysts at Morningstar:
 
 TD Canadian Index Class E is one of Toronto-Dominion Bank’s E-series 
low-cost index funds, which you purchase on the Internet. With an MER 
of only 0.31 percent, this is a cheap way to track the S&P/TSX composite 
index. Investors should keep in mind that, as with any fund that shad-
ows this index, further diversification is recommended given its high 
concentration in resources and financials.
 
 iShares Canadian DEX Real Return Bond Index is an ETF that invests 
in real return bonds by mimicking the DEX (formerly Scotia Capital) real 
return bond index. It offers a safe and simple way to hedge against rising 
inflation. Given that the actively managed funds in this space tend to be 
expensive, investors looking to include this asset class in their portfolios 
will be well served by owning this ETF, with its attractive 0.35 percent MER.
 
 iShares CDN S&P 500 Index is a currency-neutral, exchange-traded fund 
(ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 composite index. Its modest 0.24 percent 
MER makes this one of the cheapest ways to invest in the U.S. stock market 
and gives the fund an instant leg up on the competition. Note, however, that 
even less expensive alternatives are available if you don’t mind taking on 
foreign currency risk. For instance, the fund’s U.S.–dollar version, iShares 
S&P 500, and its main rival, the SPDR S&P 500 (traded on New York’s 
American Stock Exchange), can be had for less than half the price.

244
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Not the Norm: Specialized 
Index Funds and ETFs
Although index funds and ETFs are most commonly used by investors to 
track the performance of the market as a whole, some specialized index 
funds and ETFs do exist. These funds are constructed to invest in certain 
types of stocks, or to track particular sectors.
Tilted funds: Indexing on steroids
Tilted funds have portfolios that are based on an index but adjusted to favour 
a certain investment style. Such adjustments are done according to a strict, 
consistent formula. For example, a tilted equity index fund might skew its 
portfolio slightly in favour of either growth or value stocks and/or toward 
either small- or large-cap shares. A tilted bond index fund might favour either 
debt issues with either short- or long-term maturities and/or a particular 
credit quality.
A well-known fund manager in this area in North America is Dimensional Fund 
Advisors, which sells nine DFA funds in Canada. Its DFA Core Canadian Equity 
Fund is based on the S&P/TSX composite index with what it describes as a 
“modest tilt toward small cap stocks and value stocks.” Its investment gurus 
Cashing in or out?
Those sleek advisers who knock index funds 
sometimes claim these funds will plummet 
when stock markets are bad because index 
funds don’t hold any cash reserves. Part of 
what they say is true — index funds are all 
about matching a market benchmark, instead 
of forecasting the direction of the market, so 
they nearly always simply hold the stocks in the 
index with barely any cash. By contrast, more 
than half of Canadian equity funds had at least 
3 percent of their assets in safe-but-dull cash 
in mid-2008.
Although a fund with lots of cash will probably 
ride out a market downturn better than an index 
fund, stocks go up in the long term — which is 
really the point of the whole exercise. Sticking 
with cash-heavy investments means you’re 
partly out of the game. And the index fund that 
drops first because it has no cash is also likely 
to bounce back to new highs sooner as the 
index itself recovers.
The fund industry speaks with a forked tongue 
on the question of cash in funds. On the one 
hand, fund companies say it’s your time in the 
market that counts, not timing the market. Learn 
from history: Stay the course, hold on to your 
equity funds, and avoid jumping in and out of 
the market. On the other hand, managers are 
allowed to carry tens of millions of dollars in 
cash in their funds for long periods.

245
 Chapter 15: Index Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds
are Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, two U.S. professors and mathematicians 
whose research concluded that these types of stocks have a higher level of risk 
than large-cap and growth stocks and this contributes to higher expected rates 
of return. DFA Core Canadian Equity adjusts its portfolio to include small-cap 
stocks that are not in the composite index. The result is a weighted average 
market capitalization that, as of March 2008, was 20 percent lower than that of 
the index. (Weighting within a portfolio or index gives more emphasis to hold-
ings that have higher values than to those with lower values, thus producing 
a more meaningful “average” figure, one that is not based purely on the sheer 
quantity of holdings.)
DFA Core Canadian Equity had more than 630 stocks in its portfolio at that 
time, compared with 250 or so in the index. So far, the strategy has produced 
lagging performance — although the fund has been around only a few years 
and thus has not had a chance to prove its mettle over the long term. As of 
mid-2008, it had a three-year compound annual return of 12.5 percent, com-
pared with 23.6 percent for the S&P/TSX composite index.
Other ETF options
ETFs don’t limit you to ownership of a broad market index. In Canada, for exam-
ple, you can buy iShares funds that track several of the S&P/TSX subindexes — 
energy, financial, gold, materials, and technology industry sectors — as well as 
a small-cap fund. All have much lower MERs than the specialized mutual funds 
that invest in those areas.
A newcomer, Claymore Investments Inc. of Toronto, has 18 ETFs based on 
a variety of specific indexes. For example, one is based on Manulife’s MFC 
Global Agriculture Index and another on the Sustainable Wealth Oil Sands 
Sector Index (created by Sustainable Wealth Management Ltd. of Calgary).
On the fixed-income side, six iShares ETFs are based on bond indexes that 
track various bond markets. These funds are designed to give you the same 
return as government of Canada five-year bonds and “iG10” units that give 
you ownership of ten-year bonds. Again, the MER is rock-bottom, at only 
0.25 to 0.5 percent annually compared with about 1.5 percent for the median 
Canadian fixed-income fund.
 
Although the addition of any new cost-effective fund is welcome, ETFs tend 
to be bought as an inexpensive, simple means of investing in a broad index, 
minimizing the number and extent of investment decisions. However, when 
you buy ETFs that focus on specific sectors, in effect you’re getting into market 
timing and making bets that stocks in, say, the technology industry — or 
long-term bonds — are going to do better than other sectors or the market as 
a whole. So tread carefully when building an ETF portfolio; you’re probably 
better off sticking to those that track broad indexes.

W
e’re afraid dividend and income funds exist in an area where the mutual 
fund industry has taken a great idea and turned it into a tangled mass 
of very different funds. The basic theory behind dividend funds is a good one — 
invest in blue-chip companies that pay a steady flow of increasing dividends, and 
you’ll be off to the races. Dividends are the quarterly payments a company pays 
to its owners — the shareholders who own its shares. (Although this fund cat-
egory includes both income and dividend funds, most of the funds in this group 
overwhelmingly invest in common stocks that pay dividends.)
Over the long term, buying into good-quality companies and growing rich 
as the dividends increase annually has been one of the best ways to build 
wealth. If you hold shares in successful companies for long enough, then 
your dividends will increase to the point where they represent a meaningful 
source of income. Seems simple, doesn’t it? Don’t count your earnings yet. 
This story has a lot more to it than that.
In this chapter we demystify the concept of the dividend and income fund, 
identify who should buy one, review the various types of dividend funds, and 
wrap up with some valuable tips on picking a winner. We also look at income 
trust funds, which sprung up early in this decade to give mutual fund buyers 
an opportunity to invest in the herd of income trusts — vehicles that pay the 
cash flow from a business directly to investors. We tell the whole sordid 
story of those once tax-effective investments and how they fell to Earth in 
late 2006.

248
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
What Are Dividend and Income Funds?
When a company earns a profit, it can do only two things with the money: re-
invest it in the business or pay all or part of it out as dividends, actual cash paid 
to those who hold shares in the company. That’s true for every company — from 
the dirtiest restaurant in Prince Rupert, B.C. (beware the chicken fricassee) to 
the swishest financial holding company in the fanciest marble-clad office tower 
in Toronto. Traditionally, established blue-chip corporations have lined their 
shareholders’ pockets over the years by regularly paying a nice steady dividend.
 
A blue-chip company is a big and stable business, such as Toronto-Dominion 
Bank or supermarket giant Loblaw Cos. Ltd. The term blue chip comes from 
poker, where a blue betting chip usually has a high value.
 
We have some good news for you if you buy into a large blue-chip company. 
The other shareholders include big and assertive professional investors, 
horse-faced people with loud voices who usually keep management focused. 
So if you hold shares in big businesses, you can usually be sure the compa-
nies’ managers and directors are under at least some pressure to look out for 
the interests of you and the other shareholders. By contrast, if you invest in 
small companies, they may not be big enough to attract professional inves-
tors, so management will find it easier to neglect shareholders’ interests.
Many mutual fund companies sell conservative dividend and income funds 
that simply buy shares in a bunch of blue-chip mega-companies such as 
BCE Inc. or Royal Bank of Canada and then pass the dividends they collect 
straight through to their unitholders. This is investing in dividend funds at its 
very best — clean and simple.
Looking at the upside of dividend funds
Many big dividend and income funds perform well, producing a stream of 
ready cash for their investors. In other words, they collect the dividends from 
big companies and pay them out to you. Best of all, the money normally comes 
from the fund to you as a dividend payment for tax purposes that’s lightly 
taxed (more on that under “The Appealing Tax Implications of Dividends”).
Considering the downside
Sounds great so far, doesn’t it? You’re probably wondering why we’re so 
cranky about dividend and income funds. The problem is that sometimes 
their complexity and lack of transparency (always a bad sign in the world 
of investing) make them next to impossible to wrap your brain around. In 
theory they’re great; in action they can be horribly confusing.

249
 Chapter 16: Dividend and Income Funds: Confusion Galore
 
It can be hard to tell whether a fund will actually pay you very much in the 
way of dividends, whether the distributions will actually be dividends or inter-
est income, and whether the manager is really seeking dividend income or is 
in fact chasing stocks that will go up. But don’t worry, in this section we show 
you a simple way to figure out what the flow of dividends from a dividend and 
income fund is likely to be — just look at the fund’s main holdings and they’ll 
tip you off as to what sort of job the fund will do for you.
 
Some dividend and income funds boost their flow of monthly payments to 
unitholders by holding riskier assets such as trusts that buy into oil wells. 
That’ll increase the payments you get from the fund — but the stream of pay-
ments these investments dish out to the fund (and ultimately to you) could 
get cut drastically when business conditions turn down.
No matter how attractive those dividends might sound, over time there 
seems to be no substitute for good old capital gains. (Capital gains are trad-
ing profits a fund earns by buying assets at a low price and selling them at a 
better price.) As of mid-2008, on a median compound annual basis, Canadian 
equity mutual funds outperformed their dividend and income counterparts 
16.3 percent to 12.1 percent over five years and 8.5 percent to 8 percent over 
ten years (see Figure 16-1).

Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Figuring out why companies pay, 
or don’t pay, dividends
Companies pay dividends to their shareholders because that’s how the owners 
of the business are rewarded. A large and well-established business, such as a 
bank, usually throws off enough profits each year to cover the cost of acquir-
ing new equipment and other assets and still has money left over to pay out as 
dividends. But some companies — particularly fast-growing technology outfits 
with huge needs for cash to research and develop new products — don’t earn 
enough cash each year to come up with a dividend. They offer such good pros-
pects for growth in sales and profits over the medium to long term, however, 
that investors are happy to buy their shares even though little chance exists of 
getting a dividend for several years.
Slow-growing companies
Traditionally, boring businesses whose earnings grow slowly have had to pay 
out up to half of their profits each year in dividends in order to keep inves-
tors interested in their shares. Traditionally this has meant shares of one of 
the big five banks or utilities, such as pipeline operator TransCanada Corp., 
which as of mid-2008 paid a healthy dividend of $1.44 a share. That works out 
to a fat annual dividend yield of 3.6 percent. In other words, TransCanada’s 
common shares traded at around $40 in mid-2008 and the annual dividend 
per share was $1.44; $1.44 represents 3.6 percent of $40, so the annual yield 
was 3.6 percent.
Banks are able to increase their profits faster than utilities, partly because 
they’re expanding in profitable areas such as mutual funds. But banks are 
such big companies already they can’t increase their profits as fast as, say, a 
software company can. So they occupy a sort of middle ground, made up of 
companies that are likely to increase their earnings at a respectable but not 
feverish pace in coming years. Banks also pay out a relatively large propor-
tion of their profits as dividends to shareholders. As of mid-2008, most big 
bank stocks yielded between 4 and 6 percent. That might not sound gener-
ous, but it wasn’t bad when you consider the stocks in the broad Standard & 
Poor’s/Toronto Stock Exchange as a whole yielded just 2.3 percent.
 
Blue-chip companies are sometimes forced to cut their dividends when 
their profits fall unexpectedly. TransCanada did so, to great consternation 
and dismay among investors, at the end of 1999. Happily for its investors, 
the company has been raising its dividend ever since. And, for that matter, 
dividend cuts by established companies are rare because shareholders hate 
such reductions. They hate ’em like poison. Managers are unlikely to estab-
lish an annual dividend rate in the first place, if they know they’ll have to take 
the humiliating step of reducing it. A portfolio that holds at least half a dozen 
blue-chip stocks — such as the typical dividend and income fund — will 
spread your risk, reducing the pain if one of them slashes a dividend.

 Chapter 16: Dividend and Income Funds: Confusion Galore
Growth companies
So-called growth companies, whose profits are expected to increase rapidly, 
can get away with paying little or nothing in dividends, and investors still tend 
to throw their hat — and their cash — into the ring by buying the companies’ 
shares. Investors are willing to forgo gratification today so the company can 
use the cash to build its business instead. The idea is that when the dividends 
do eventually come, they’ll be bigger than if the company had paid out the 
cash to shareholders earlier in the game.
When the stock market bull is raging, dividend yield is the farthest thing from 
an investor’s mind. In the techno-frenzy of the late 1990s and in 2000, you 
hardly heard a murmur about dividends. Dude, who cared? Don’t-Care was 
made to care, in this case, as the Canadian stock market tumbled nearly 20 
percent in 2001 and 2002. But the median dividend and income fund, typically 
with a heavy larding of stable stocks that pay dividends, managed to break 
even during that two-year period.
 
Hold at least some conservative dividend-paying stocks, even within an RRSP. 
Because as the popping of the tech stock balloon showed, it’s nice to own 
something that doesn’t depend on a weedy teenage software genius stay-
ing conscious. But don’t worry. You don’t have to take special vitamin pills 
if your diet is rich and varied, including plenty of herrings’ backsides. And, 
by analogy, you don’t need to worry about buying a special dividend fund if 
your portfolio includes some high-quality equity funds, like those we cover in 
Chapter 11. Those funds are bound to hold several dividend-type stocks — 
and that covers your daily requirement.
 
Those seemingly insignificant little quarterly dividend cheques are what capi-
talism and the stock market are all about. Under the law — in the Anglo-Saxon 
world, at least (and elsewhere, more and more, as the whole world becomes 
obsessed with investing in stocks à l’américaine) — dividends are about the 
only way that shareholders can legally get any money out of their company. 
Yes, they get a payoff if the company is taken over at a fat price or if they sell 
the shares after they’ve gone up or if the company “spins off” an asset to its 
shareholders in the form of a special restructuring. But receiving a dividend 
remains the only fundamental way in which you can actually extract cash from 
a business (apart from when an executive receives a bloated salary or options 
package). It’s the thing that ultimately gives a share any value.
What does this all mean to the mutual fund investor? Just that it’s fine to 
engage in torrid flirtation with a natural resources fund or aggressive growth 
fund, but limit it to a dalliance using just a tiny part of your money. Your 
core equity funds should also hold plenty of blue-chip stocks that pay a 
meaningful and rising dividend. Because when a market crash comes — and 
they always do — they’re the shares that are most likely to fall the least and 
recover first.

252
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Determining Whether Dividend and 
Income Funds Are Right for You
A dividend or income fund will suit you best if you meet one or more of the 
following tests:
 
 You’re a long-termer but you need cash now: You need the long-term 
growth prospects offered by shares, but you also need to make regular 
withdrawals from your portfolio of investments. Many dividend funds 
are designed to accumulate a steady stream of cash, which they pay out 
regularly.
 
 You’re in a high tax bracket: You face a high rate of tax on the income 
and profits earned by your investments. That might be because you 
already have a high income or because your investments are held in a 
taxable account, not a tax-deferred plan such as a registered retirement 
savings plan. Remember that dividends are lightly taxed, which makes 
them a great way to earn investment income for a taxable investor. That 
means the payments you get from a dividend fund won’t be too badly 
savaged by the government.
 
 You’re not a risk taker: You’re nervous about the stock market and you 
feel happiest with a stock fund full of conservatively run large compa-
nies, the sort that pay lots of dividends.
But dividend funds aren’t right for everyone, especially people who don’t 
care if their investments pay out a regular income. Why bother with collect-
ing dividends if it compromises your long-term returns?
Don’t expect big dividends
Modern investors still don’t ask company man-
agers to “show them the money” in the form of 
a big dividend. They still appear willing to wait 
years for future profits and dividends — or to 
gamble on castles in the air, depending on how 
cynical you are.
Most big companies pay at least some dividends. 
But so much investor money is already chasing 
high-quality stocks that pay a decent rate that 
prices have been pushed sky-high. An invest-
ment in the S&P/TSX composite index (say, 
through the iShares S&P/RSX composite index 
fund) in mid-2008 would provide a limp annual 
dividend yield of only about 2.3 percent — in 
other words, if you tied $100 up in the S&P/TSX 
stocks, you got only $2.30 in annual dividends.
In part, that was because interest rates were 
low. With ten-year bonds yielding only about 
3.8 percent a year, there weren’t many quality 
investments around that produced any sort of 
decent income stream, so you might as well 
have stuck with shares.

253
 Chapter 16: Dividend and Income Funds: Confusion Galore
If your aim is to build your money over many years, then you’ll probably do 
better in a regular stock fund that’s free to buy shares in all sorts of companies, 
including those that pay hardly anything in dividends. That way, you’ll own 
a balanced mixture of shares that also includes some high-flying technology 
players and natural resource producers, and not just a portfolio of blue-chip, 
conservative names.
The Appealing Tax Implications 
of Dividends
In Chapter 23, we take a close look at how the periodic payments you get 
from a mutual fund are taxed. Dividend and income funds — assuming they 
are among the vast majority that hold mostly dividend-paying stocks — get 
special treatment when it comes to taxes. They can be one of the best ways 
of earning a stream of income that doesn’t get too badly mutilated by the 
tax collector. To encourage Canadians to buy shares issued by Canadian 
corporations (to help the economy grow), dividends are taxed far more 
lightly than interest income, which is the sort of fixed payment you get 
from a bank account, bond, or fixed-term deposit such as a guaranteed 
investment certificate.
Crunching the numbers
As a quick-and-dirty rule, each $1 of dividend income is as good as $1.25 of 
interest income because the taxes on the interest-income dollar are so much 
higher. If you earn $125 in interest and only $100 in dividends, you’ll end up 
with about the same amount after taxes. Dividends are tax-efficient or tax-
advantaged investments, because this type of investment actually helps you 
keep more of your hard-earned income.
 
You’ll know if any mutual fund you own has paid you distributions in the form 
of capital gains, dividends, or interest because it’ll be indicated on the T3 or 
T5 statement of investment income you get from your fund company each 
year to mail in with your tax return. The calculation for reporting dividends on 
your tax form is a little laborious and weird, but you soon get used to it (amaz-
ing how the prospect of putting more money in one’s pocket tends to fire up 
the old synapses). Essentially the principle is this: You “gross up” the amount 
of dividends received by increasing them by 25 percent and you report that 
amount on your tax form. But you then reduce your tax payable by a “tax 
credit” amounting to 16.7 percent of the dividends actually received. Don’t 
fret: The tax form provides a step-by-step guide.

254
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Understanding why dividend funds may 
or may not be good for your RRSP
Fund salespeople have long preached that collecting dividends within a tax-
sheltered account such as a registered retirement savings plan isn’t that 
important. That’s for two reasons:
 
 All the income earned inside such a plan is tax-deferred anyway. And 
all withdrawals from the plan are heavily taxed as regular income. That 
means the dividend tax break is no use within an RRSP, so dividend 
funds — which are designed to take advantage of the tax law — arguably 
aren’t a good fit.
 
 For your core equity funds in an RRSP, it may be better to buy normal 
equity funds rather than dividend funds because the managers of regu-
lar funds have a freer hand to play the market, rather than trying to 
maximize their dividend income.
An instant dividend-paying portfolio
As we discuss in Chapter 15, index funds are one 
of our favourite ways to invest. And no better 
way to do so exists than through an exchange-
traded fund (ETF). An ETF is a fund that is traded 
on a stock exchange — as opposed to being 
sold and redeemed directly by mutual fund 
companies. Of greater interest is the fact that 
its portfolio is based on a stock index, such as 
the Standard & Poor’s/Toronto Stock Exchange 
composite index.
The ETF market has expanded rapidly in recent 
years to include funds that are based on some 
of the Toronto Stock Exchange’s specific indus-
try groups. One fund provides an instant portfo-
lio of blue-chip TSX dividend-paying stocks.
The iShares Dow Jones Canada Select 
Dividend Index Fund holds 30 of the highest 
yielding dividend-paying companies in the Dow 
Jones Canada Total Market Index. Analysts at 
Dow Jones look at companies’ dividend growth, 
yield, and average payout ratio to determine 
which stocks make the fund’s portfolio. Its three 
biggest holdings in mid-2008 were Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce, Manitoba Telecom, 
and National Bank of Canada.
Like most ETFs, Dow Select Dividend’s MER is 
low, low, low — 0.5 percent, compared with 
2.23 percent for the median Canadian dividend 
and income fund. However, performance of the 
fund, launched at the end of 2005, lagged behind 
the median fund in the category. As of mid-2008 
it had a two-year compound annual return of 
4.6 percent, 1.3 percentage points behind the 
median fund.

255
 Chapter 16: Dividend and Income Funds: Confusion Galore
But because many dividend and income funds hold big familiar companies, 
they can logically be treated as super-conservative equity funds that are well 
suited for RRSPs. Remember the 2001–2002 experience, when dividend and 
income funds outperformed general Canadian equity funds. The bottom line 
seems to be this: Check the holdings of a dividend fund, and if it’s full of regu-
lar shares in big companies — as opposed to things like income trusts or other 
investments that are designed to throw off regular streams of cash — then it 
can probably be treated as a conservative equity fund.
Selecting a Winning Dividend Fund
Don’t just grab the first dividend and income fund you’re offered. Make sure 
the fund you buy comes with a reasonable management expense ratio — 
certainly less than the category’s 2.23-percent median value. Ensure its larg-
est holdings include the sort of shares and trust units you want to own: high-
quality stocks or units of companies in sectors that are known to provide 
reliable dividends and other income.
Questions to ask before you buy
Here are the questions to put to your salesperson, no-load fund company, 
or bank employee. If you can’t get a straight answer, then consider shopping 
elsewhere:
 
 What distributions has this fund paid over the past year, and how 
frequently?
 
 Is there a stated monthly distribution, and how much is it?
 
 Which distributions over the past year counted as dividends from tax-
able Canadian corporations, entitling the fund’s investors to claim the 
dividend tax credit?
 
 Did any of the distributions include a return of capital — a partial refund 
of the investor’s own money — to maintain a stated payout rate? Such 
returns of capital can be not only potentially misleading, but also hor-
rendous to account for at tax time.
 
You can find this information easily in a fund’s management report of fund 
performance, or MRFP, which should be available as a download from the 
fund company’s Web site. The information will be only as current as the 
most recent MRFP, but because these reports come out every six months, 
that should be current enough to give you a good idea of what you might 
expect in the way of distribution types and amounts.

256
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Two strong dividend and income funds
 
Here are a couple of top-quality dividend and income funds recommended by 
analysts at Morningstar:
 
 TD Monthly Income has done a remarkable job of giving investors the 
best of both worlds: high returns with relatively modest risk. Much 
of the fund’s outstanding performance was driven by exposure to the 
income trust market. In recent years, the income trust market has 
cooled and investors shouldn’t expect this fund — or any income-
oriented balanced fund — to produce double-digit returns consistently. 
(We look at income trusts in the next section.)
 
 Even in the post–income trust world, you still can expect this fund to 
post respectable returns while paying a modest amount of income. 
Unlike many income-oriented funds, this fund doesn’t have a fixed 
payout schedule. Each year TD determines how much the fund can 
reasonably pay out without eroding its capital base. Historically, that 
number has been in the 2 to 3 percent range annually. However, TD does 
offer different versions (H and T) of this fund that have higher fixed 
payout amounts of 8 percent annually if you’re looking for more income.
 
 CIBC Monthly Income also has achieved outstanding returns due in large 
part to its considerable income trust exposure. So investors shouldn’t 
expect this fund to reproduce that kind of performance heading forward 
either. The fund maintains a considerable exposure to common stocks, 
which should help it produce high-single-digit returns over the long run. 
Unlike TD Monthly Income, this fund pays a fixed six cents per share to 
investors each month. That works out to a respectable 4.5 to 5 percent 
annually.
These funds have reasonable expenses and well-regarded managers, but 
remember to ask plenty of questions before you invest.
The Times Are a’Changin’: The Fall of 
Preferred Shares and Income Trusts
Just as fashion ruthlessly moves forward, making your rayon shirt an eyesore 
instead of a prized possession, so too does the investment world, and what 
was hot on Bay Street one day won’t be the next. In this section we look at 
two investment equivalents to platform shoes and bell-bottom trousers.

257
 Chapter 16: Dividend and Income Funds: Confusion Galore
Preferred shares
Time was when almost all dividend funds invested in preferred shares. But 
these funds are far and few between nowadays, as the preferred security is 
practically on the financial industry’s endangered species list.
For the history books, preferred shares pay a fixed and usually high dividend, 
which is nice, but the dividend doesn’t grow over time. In other words, pre-
ferred shareholders are more like lenders to a company than owners. By 
contrast, an ordinary or common share in a company pays a lower dividend, 
but the annual rate tends to increase over the years, providing an investment 
whose value should increase over time.
Preferred shares suit investors who want predictability but also relish the 
nice tax break attached to dividends. These shares pay a high fixed stated 
dividend, which can be reduced or omitted if the company hits turbulence — 
but in practice rarely is. And preferred shareholders nearly always get their 
dividends before common shareholders are entitled to receive a cent, hence 
the name.
In return for that lightly taxed and relatively generous stream of income, 
preferred shareholders miss out on the chance of prospering if the business 
booms. Preferreds nearly always stay close to their issue price, dropping a 
little when interest rates rise and rising when rates fall, just like bonds do. 
You can spot them in stock listings by their trading symbol, which always 
has “PR” in it. If a stock has a percentage value as part of its name, then it’s a 
preferred share that was set up to produce that percentage yield for buyers 
of the stock when it was first issued.
Only a dozen or so among the 185 dividend and income funds hold a signifi-
cant portion of their portfolios in preferreds. The category is now almost 
entirely dominated by income-oriented equity funds that derive as much 
as, if not more of, their returns from market performance. They load up on 
stocks of banks, utilities, pipelines, blue-chip industrial companies — and 
sometimes even growth companies that pay hardly any dividends. The man-
ager of today’s typical dividend and income fund tries to increase the value 
of his or her fund’s units as the price of the stocks it holds rises, while also 
paying out at least some dividend income. Still, these funds’ holdings are 
usually so conservative they’re less volatile than regular equity funds.

258
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Income trust funds
Until late 2006, these funds were the place to be in mutual funds. Everyone 
was hungry for the tax-efficient income these funds provided, and staid, old, 
slightly higher taxed dividends just didn’t cut it anymore. Publicly traded 
companies were spinning off parts of their operations as income trusts left 
right and centre. Entire companies were reinventing themselves as income 
trusts, seemingly simply to make themselves into income-spewing, investor-
friendly investment machines. But then the federal government, under 
pressure from proponents of the traditional stock market, put an end to the 
madness, levelling the taxation playing field so that owning an income trust 
unit was no more tax-wise than owning a dividend-paying share. (We delve 
into the taxation of income trusts in Chapter 23.)
However, as of mid-2008, more than 40 income trust funds were available. 
They’re still worth a look — in fact, we suggest you evaluate them as poten-
tial investments as you would any other Canadian equity investment. After 
all, if an income trust’s price falls precipitously, all the income in the world 
will be of little consequence if you’ve lost on your original investment. You 
can read more about income trusts in Chapter 5.

 Picking a quality money market fund
S
ome archaeologists and historians have an interesting theory to explain 
why the Romans were so successful in war, usually against massive odds 
(apart from Russell Crowe, that is). Bathrooms. Yes, that’s right, bathrooms. 
The Romans liked their plumbing. Centuries before most of Western Europe 
had any kind of organized sanitation, the Romans were building bathhouses 
and sewage systems. Even in the field, they stuck to their clean-living ways. 
This meant their armies didn’t die en masse of typhoid, cholera, and other 
diseases transmitted by, well, patchy hygiene. Money market funds are a bit 
like the humble throne in the bathroom, the white porcelain god that sepa-
rates us from 15th-century Bruges with its pungent odours, annoying jesters, 
and unspeakable ditches down the middle of the street. They’re dull, they’re 
predictable, they’re almost invisible — and they’re one of the mutual fund 
industry’s greatest inventions.
Money market funds are simply a safe parking spot for cash, designed to 
produce at least some sort of return. They generate a modest stream of 
income, especially in recent years when interest rates have been extremely 
low. Indeed, the median Canadian money market fund produced an anemic 
ten-year compound annual return of 3 percent as of spring 2008. These funds 
invest in government treasury bills, very short-term bonds, and other fixed-
income securities that usually have less than three months to go before they 
mature and the issuer pays the holders their money back. Money market 
funds are different in structure from normal mutual funds, and the way they

calculate their returns can be confusing. But just use the same rules to pick 
one as you do with bond funds: Buy quality and, more than ever, insist on a 
low management expense ratio (MER) — 1 percent annually at the very most. 
(The MER is the cost of managing a fund, and normally includes fees paid to 
the fund’s portfolio managers, as well as marketing, sales, administration, 
legal, accounting, and reporting costs. These costs are charged directly to 
the fund, as a percentage of the fund’s total assets. The fund’s net asset value 
includes the MER.)
As with all mutual fund investing programs, do more than just insist on low 
costs when buying a money market fund. Lean across the table — glaring at 
the hapless salesperson through bulging, insane eyes — part your spit-flecked 
lips and demand a fund that has a very low MER. Otherwise, you won’t make 
anything off a money market fund.
In this chapter, we show you why money market funds are a great place to 
hold your cash while you wait to spend or invest it. We also show you how to 
spot a good money market fund.
How Money Market Funds Work
Throughout this book we give you tons of grim warnings about how you can 
easily lose money in mutual funds because of a drop in their unit price. Well, 
at the risk of contradicting ourselves, that doesn’t apply to the vast majority of 
money market funds because they are held steady at a fixed value, usually $10.
 
Some money market funds — especially the guaranteed type that promise to 
refund some or all of your money — have unit prices that do increase over time.
Keeping the unit price fixed isn’t required by law, but it’s the practice among 
fund companies. In theory, if short-term rates were to shoot up exponentially 
or the government’s credit rating collapsed in some kind of unprecedented 
catastrophe, the fund company would let the value of your money market 
units drop. But by that time, you’ll be too busy pitching bottles at the giant 
green spacecraft that just zapped your dog to worry much about it. In other 
words, woe betide the fund company that lets its money market fund units 
drop below their fixed value. Investors who buy this type of fund aren’t 
known for their devil-may-care attitude to losses. So money market funds are 
rather like a guaranteed investment certificate: You’re certain of getting your 
cash back, plus extra units that represent the interest you’ve earned along 
the way.

261
 Chapter 17: Money Market Funds: Welcome to Sleepy Hollow
The interest is usually calculated daily, but it’s generally added to your account 
every month or when you sell your units. However, money market funds, like 
nearly all mutual funds, beat the pants off GICs because they’re “liquid.” That’s a 
bit of investment industry jargon that simply means you can liquidate — turn the 
investment into ready cash — at a moment’s notice. Unlike GICs, money market 
funds refund your money without penalty, usually at a day’s notice.
As a guideline, the return from money market funds tends to be similar to the 
return from one-year GICs, particularly during shorter terms. However, in the 
longer term, GICs have done better; the typical five-year GIC had a 3.7 percent 
annualized return during the ten years ended March 2008. However, that’s less 
than you could have gained from an investment in a balanced fund — normally 
The fix isn’t always in
The unit value of some money market funds 
does change, increasing slowly as the fund 
earns interest income. These are the so-called 
“segregated fund” or “guaranteed investment 
fund” versions of money market funds. Seg 
or guaranteed funds are funds that promise 
to refund most or all of the holder’s original 
investment, as long as he or she sticks around 
long enough. Chapter 19 deals with segregated 
funds.
Mind you, with something as safe as a money 
market fund, such a guarantee is pretty point-
less and almost certainly not worth the higher 
expenses charged on such funds. Some hit their 
investors for as much as 2 percent annually, 
which leaves little or nothing for unitholders 
after taxes and inflation are taken into account. 
For legal reasons to do with insurance contracts 
(you’d get too excited if we explained them all 
to you), guaranteed and segregated funds often 
don’t give unitholders their returns in the form 
of extra units. They simply reinvest all interest, 
capital gains, and other income so that holders 
of the fund own units with a steadily increasing 
value. Yet other examples both increase their 
unit value and pay distributions, just like normal 
mutual funds. It’s terribly confusing for inves-
tors, and your salesperson or bank employee 
could have trouble keeping up. One simple 
reason justifies the existence of guaranteed and 
segregated money market funds: They provide 
a temporary cash parking spot for investors in 
a company’s other guaranteed and segregated 
fund families, thus avoiding switch-out fees if 
they were to seek an external place to tempo-
rarily store their money pending a reinvestment 
decision.
Your statement from the fund company should 
clearly show what’s going on, although that’s 
not always the case. Consider switching to 
another fund company or broker if you can’t 
get a proper explanation — a clear and simple 
explanation of how your funds work is your 
inalienable right as an investor. Even if you’re 
an alien.
You can also go to morningstar.ca or 
globefund.com and check the latest distri-
butions paid by a fund. This should give you an 
idea of what system the fund uses.

262
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
a pretty cautious mix of stuff from the stock market (which is always volatile) 
and bonds (which usually work in great slow cycles). The median Canadian 
neutral balanced fund — the most conservative among the various balanced-
fund categories — achieved a 4.6-percent annualized return during that ten-
year period. (For more about balanced funds, refer to Chapter 13.)
The yield is just the harvest you get on your money, expressed as a percent-
age of what you invested. So, a madcap biotech fund might go up 50 percent 
in a year — at huge risk — turning $1,000 into $1,500 (always assuming you 
were canny enough to sell out before it crashed). For the typical money 
market fund, however, assuming a current yield of about 2 percent, we’re 
talking about a return of 20 bucks for tying up $1,000 for a year.
 
With a money market fund, you nearly always buy a set of units at a fixed 
price, usually $10, and that unit price never changes. Your return comes in 
the form of extra units paid out to you along the way. You’re not going to get 
wealthy soon with one of these funds. Just like bond funds, they’re designed 
only to earn a steady and fairly predictable return, with none of the flash, risk, 
and potential for big gains you get with an equity fund.
Checking Up on Your 
Money Market Fund
Say you want to buy a money market fund but don’t know what the yield over 
the next year is likely to be. Because most money market funds have constant 
prices, you need to look for a fund’s current yield and effective yield. These 
values represent rough forecasts of what the fund, with its current portfolio, 
is likely to earn over the next year. Each yield figure uses a slightly different 
calculation, which we outline in a moment. But remember, both of these yield 
numbers are just estimates.
 
Money market funds are full of short-term stuff that matures in the next few 
months, so the portfolio manager can’t be sure if he or she will be able to replace 
those T-bills and other short-term securities with new investments that will 
produce the same return. If rates are falling, then it will be almost impossible 
to do so. Don’t worry about the difference between the two types of yield. Each 
calculation basically boils down to the same number of dollars and cents in your 
pocket. But just for the record, here’s how to tell them apart:

263
 Chapter 17: Money Market Funds: Welcome to Sleepy Hollow
 
 Current yield: Sometimes called the indicated yield, this shows the yield 
the fund earned over the past seven days, which is then “annualized” to 
show what the same rate of return would work out to over one whole year.
 
 Effective yield: The effective yield is the same annualized number, but 
this time it assumes that all distributions are reinvested in more units, 
thus achieving compounding. Because it assumes the new units are 
being added to your stockpile during the year, earning that extra bit of 
interest, the effective yield is usually a fraction of a percentage point 
higher than the current yield.
 
A fund’s current yield is easy to find on all fund companies’ Web sites — just 
look for a link to “Prices and Performance,” or similar terminology. For money 
market funds, you’ll find tables showing current yields under the Price/Yield 
column. Finding the effective yield isn’t so easy; only a few of the fund compa-
nies’ Web sites provide separate columns for current and effective yields.
 
When inflation and interest rates are low, no real gap exists between the two 
types of yield. For example, in mid-2008, the $5.1-billion CIBC Money Market 
Fund (Class A) quoted a current yield of 2.21 percent and an effective yield 
of 2.23 percent. In times of high interest rates, when compounding means the 
new units pile up fast, the effective yield will be quite a bit higher. But the low 
interest rates in 2008 meant there wasn’t much difference at all.
When short-term interest rates were high — such as the early 1990s, when 
the returns on money market funds climbed well above 10 percent — fund 
companies started making a lot of noise about their “effective yields,” which 
were much higher than the “current yield” (because the money was theoreti-
cally going to compound at high rates). But investors became so confused over 
which yield was which (and who can blame them?) the regulators eventually 
stepped in. The fund industry agreed to show both figures in its advertisements.
Why Money Markets May Not Be All 
They’re Cracked Up to Be
Don’t just assume a money market fund is the only place to park your cash — 
you can usually earn a full percentage point or two more annually with a low-
risk short-term bond fund that has low expenses of 1 percent or less. Chapter 
14 on bond funds suggests a few good candidates.

264
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Short-term bond funds can be even 
better than money market funds
Canadian short-term fixed-income funds posted a median annualized return 
of 2.5 percent over the ten years ended June 2008 — that’s nearly a full 
percentage point more than Canadian money market funds. The drawback, 
though, was slightly more volatility and the danger of losing money. That’s 
because bond prices fall when interest rates rise, as explained in Chapter 
14, although short-term bonds fall the least of all (when interest rates drop, 
however, they also go up the least). Money market funds, by contrast, are 
designed never to leave investors with a loss. For example, when interest 
rates rose suddenly in 1994, the average short-term bond fund suffered a loss 
of almost 2 percent.
Before you go plunging into a short-term bond fund, sneering and making 
rude gestures at the dolts lining up to buy boring old money market funds, 
remember that the 1990s were marked by a sharp fall in interest rates. That 
gave short-term bond funds an unfair advantage because bond prices were 
lifted by those falling rates. If rates start rising again, then short-term bond 
funds will have a tougher time beating money market funds. This scenario 
usually prompts warnings about a “bond bubble,” which occurs when inves-
tors flee stocks and try to hide in bonds. If inflation goes up accompanied by 
a sharp rise in interest rates, a bond bubble can burst. Still, short-term bond 
funds are among the safest of all investments. A portfolio stuffed full of high-
quality, short-term government bonds with less than five years to go before 
they mature (check a fund’s top holdings) will ride out nearly any horror the 
markets can dole out.
Realistic expectations for money markets
How much can you expect to earn from a money market fund over the next 
year? Here’s a good guideline: Check what banks are offering to pay on one-
year GICs.
 
Over the 25 years (whew!) ended June 2008, buying one-year GICs produced 
an annual return of 5.4 percent while money market funds produced a similar 
return of 5.7 percent. To compare one-year GIC rates from all the major banks 
and other financial institutions, check weekend and/or Monday editions of 
major daily newspapers, many of which list the rates offered by virtually every 
deposit-taking institution on all sorts of loans and deposits, including GICs.

Pick Only the Plums: Selecting 
Winning Money Market Funds
Don’t stay up all night picking a money market fund, because you’ve got a 
busy day ahead — a long day of sliding through sticky mud, trying to get a 
grip on infuriated ostriches. Money market funds tend to be pretty similar. 
In other words, chasing a big yield is pointless, because to get one, the man-
ager has to take more risk. If you’re buying your other mutual funds at a bank 
or bank-owned discount broker, simply buy the bank’s money market fund. 
Enough competition exists in the industry to make it embarrassing for a bank 
to have its money market fund turn into a hound.
If you’re buying through a broker or other commissioned salesperson, his 
or her office is probably set up to put clients into a particular money market 
fund, probably from the fund company the salesperson’s organization does 
the most business with. Because money market funds are just temporary 
holding spots for cash — or they constitute the low-risk, low-return “cash” 
portion of your portfolio — one fund is pretty well as good as another.
Just make sure you can find the money market fund listed in your daily news-
paper or on the Internet. That way, you know you’ll be able to track your 
holdings and check the accuracy of your account statement.
Choosing from a mix of 
money market funds
Most money markets are ultrasafe, sticking to government-issued Treasury 
bills and bonds. Others increase the risk level very slightly, and pick up about 
one-fifth of a percentage point in annual yield. Either choice is fine — it 
depends on your personality. Here’s how to tell the two options apart:
 
 For their very nervous clients, many fund companies offer super-
conservative “T-bill” funds that buy only short-term government bonds 
and government Treasury bills (a type of bond with just a few months 
before it matures).
 
 For those willing to take on more risk in a cash investment, lower-quality 
funds — usually known simply as money market funds — exist that are 
allowed to increase their yield by buying things like corporate “commer-
cial paper”; that is, short-term debt issued by big companies when they 

266
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
need a bit of cash to tide them over. Most of these funds really aren’t dan-
gerous at all, because the companies that issue the paper they hold are 
nearly always blue-chip multinationals or their Canadian subsidiaries.
 
 However, the credit crunch that began in 2007 has cast a dark shadow 
over corporate cash investments, so make sure the money market fund 
you’re considering pretty much sticks to safe and sure T-bills and other 
guaranteed paper.
It would take quite an economic cataclysm indeed before any major money 
market fund racked up losses big enough to force the bank to let the fund’s 
unit price drop. Although some money market funds held some defaulting 
commercial debt assets in 2007, the fund sponsors purchased the assets 
from the funds in question. The bottom line is that to the typical investor, 
no significant difference exists between the conservative T-bill funds and the 
mildly more aggressive ones.
In the end, the extra bit of yield you get from a money market fund compared 
with a T-bill fund is very small. For example, the TD Canadian Money Market 
Fund, which is free to buy corporate securities, generated an annual return 
of 2.53 percent in the five years ended June 2008 — only slightly higher than 
the 2.34-percent annual return from the TD Canadian T-Bill Fund, which must 
stick to government debt.
World travellers: U.S. money market funds
A handful of companies also offer U.S. money market funds, either for inves-
tors who want to hold a lot of cash in U.S. dollars or for scaredy-cats who 
want a low-volatility investment safe from a drop in the Canadian dollar. 
Nearly all the funds in this group are bought and sold in U.S. dollars. The 
same rules apply to pick a fund. Look for low expenses if you want to end 
up with anything. Don’t believe us? Look what happened to unfortunate 
investors in the Trimark Short-Term Income Fund. The fund’s DSC (back-end 
load) units came with an MER of 1.87 percent — which left investors with 
an average annual return of only 1.8 percent for the five years ended March 
2008, compared with 2.9 percent for the average U.S. money market fund. 
In other words, investors paid out more to the fund company than they got 
back in returns.
 
The median U.S. money market fund has an MER of 1.06 percent. Why pay any-
thing more than that?

267
 Chapter 17: Money Market Funds: Welcome to Sleepy Hollow
Is thin in? Watching those pesky expenses
Always remember that because the returns from money market funds are so 
thin, the slightest increase in expenses can leave you with nothing after taxes 
and inflation. So refuse to pay a sales commission when buying a money 
market fund. The broker or salesperson should be able to let you have it 
commission-free, especially if you’re simply parking your money in the 
money market fund temporarily while you decide on a long-term home for it. 
Check that the money market fund offered by your bank or salesperson has 
produced acceptable returns. It probably has.
 
Remember, the median Canadian money market fund has an MER of 1.04 
percent — you shouldn’t be asked to pay more than that.
The lowdown on MERs
As we keep repeating over and over until readers want to shove us down 
a disused grease trap, the main thing to look for in a money market fund is 
low MERs. That can be hard in Canada because the cheapest funds, those 
with MERs of around 0.4 percent or less, are often “premium” funds from the 
banks, needing big investments of $100,000 and up, or are funds available 
only to certain groups such as professionals.
But if you’re buying only small quantities of the fund, don’t get too worked 
up about costs, either. If you have, say, $5,000 in a money market fund, rep-
resenting 5 percent of your $100,000 portfolio, then a 1-percentage-point 
reduction in expenses on the money market fund means an extra $50 a year 
for you. Nice, sure, but not a huge deal. For convenience, you may decide 
just to stick with your fund company’s money market product, even if it has 
higher expenses, and treat the extra $50 as a sort of fee. But remember that 
all expenses eat into your return.
Beware of empty promises
 
Don’t bother searching endlessly for the money market fund that promises to 
give you a few more bucks of income. If the performance looks hot, chances 
are the fund company has doctored the return in some way — no doubt 
legally but not quite candidly. That’s because in the drab world of T-bills and 
short-term bonds, generating any kind of extra return through fancy trading 

268
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
without taking on more risk is very hard. (Getting anyone to play footsie in 
the cafeteria with you at lunchtime is very hard, too, but let’s save that for 
another day.) You can be pretty sure that the yield of a high-flying fund will 
magically revert to the middle of the pack — or worse — straight after you 
buy it.
Be curious, George
As always, be curious — and cautious — when some kind of “account man-
agement” fee or commission is added on to a money market fund’s published 
expenses. If you’re thinking about paying such a fee, ask to see a sample 
statement that at least shows clients how the fee is calculated and charged. 
Does the statement clearly reveal how much is taken off? Such extra charges 
may be legitimate and even a good deal, but they make checking on your real 
return a lot more complicated.
Remember that simplicity is one of the great beauties of regular mutual 
funds, because they publish returns and unit prices after their fees. You have 
a right to a clear explanation of every fee. If the fund company or salesperson 
doesn’t respect you enough to provide you with one, then shop elsewhere.

ith more than 8,000 retail investment funds in Canada, it shouldn’t 
come as a surprise that some of them have pretty specific or unusual 
investment focuses. The variety is nothing like in the United States, where 
things can get so specific 65 funds invest only in debt securities issued by 
municipalities in Minnesota — enough to merit a special category. But the 
Canadian fund industry has grown enough to accommodate funds that have 
such specific mandates as investing in companies involved in water-supply 
infrastructure, or funds that build their portfolios around holdings in publicly 
traded stock exchanges.
In this chapter we round up a motley crew of fund oddities — funds so 
unusual they’re difficult to compare to more traditional equity, fixed-income, 
or balanced funds. These also include bona fide categories such as the long-
established but waning labour-sponsored group, as well as the relatively new 
target date or life-cycle funds. We also attempt to describe the contents of 
the catch-all “specialty” fund category, a dumping ground for funds so unique 
they can’t be placed in an existing category (and aren’t numerous enough to 
merit their own category).
Labour-Sponsored Funds: Small Business, 
Big Tax Break — For Now
A labour-sponsored fund is a venture capital fund that invests in strange little 
companies, most of which will probably fail or stagnate. Officially known 
as “labour-sponsored venture capital funds” (and now categorized by fund 

270
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
data firms as “retail venture capital” funds), they must have a formal back-
ing from a labour union and — in theory — favour investments in companies 
that have unionized workforces. Private companies aren’t publicly traded, 
which means the true market worth of the stocks the funds own is impossible 
to establish clearly. And labour funds’ expenses are often obscene. These 
beauties have a few more ugly poison spikes sticking out of them, too. Their 
investments usually take years to mature, and you lose a huge chunk of the 
benefit from most of these funds unless you leave your money sitting there 
for almost a decade.
So why did Canadians have about $2.7 billion invested in labour-sponsored 
funds as of mid-2008? Two reasons: because investors in most provinces 
could get an attractive tax break totalling 30 percent or even more of their 
investment, and because the unknown ventures these funds invest in some-
times explode in value.
You need to know three main things about these funds:
 
 You can get a sizeable tax credit: With just about all labour funds, the 
federal government refunds 15 percent of your investment in the form of 
a tax credit — and your provincial government may also give you back 
the same amount. The maximum annual investment eligible for credits 
is usually $5,000 — so investing that amount in a labour fund that quali-
fies for both federal and provincial credits will immediately net you tax 
refunds of up to $1,500 ($750 from each government). In other words, 
you could end up with $5,000 worth of fund units in return for a cash 
outlay of only $3,500. As with contributions to RRSPs, you can usually 
make your purchase of a labour fund during the first 60 days of a calen-
dar year and have the money earn tax credits for the previous year.
 
 You must make a long commitment: To stop people from buying labour 
funds, grabbing the tax credits, and then simply selling the units back to 
the fund, the federal government imposes an eight-year “hold period.” If 
you cash out of the fund within that period, you have to repay the fed-
eral tax credit. That’s up from a previous hold period of only five years. 
The government does make exceptions for illness and so on, but reckon 
on tying up your money for a long time.
 
 You may find they’re not so unified: Labour funds often have few con-
nections with the union movement — in fact, many unions want noth-
ing to do with them, complaining that they’re a sort of squalid financial 
mushroom thriving on vastly expensive government tax subsidies, with 
the money ending up in the hands of Bay Street types and non-unionized 
companies. Labour funds are a “dubious stock promotion scheme,” 
according to Jim Stanford, an economist with the Canadian Auto 
Workers.

271
 Chapter 18: Funds Oddities: Strange Brews Sometimes Worth Tasting
 
Alas, the big tax breaks have disappeared for investors in some provinces. 
In Ontario, on which the labour-fund market depends heavily, the provincial 
government has been whittling what used to be a 15-percent tax credit down 
to zero by 2011, which will leave investors with only the 15-percent federal 
tax credit still available for investments in these funds. And Ontario investors 
have been fortunate — the provincial credit originally was set to disappear 
completely in 2006. An industry lobby persuaded legislators to instead leave 
the credit in place through 2008, and then reduce it to 10 percent in 2009, 5 
percent in 2010, and eliminate it entirely as of 2011. Perhaps the government 
will relent again, but investors apparently haven’t been optimistic about this 
prospect — and likely are unimpressed by these funds’ poor performance. 
Assets invested in labour-sponsored funds had decreased 23 percent to 
$2.7 billion as of mid-2008 since Ontario first announced it was doing away 
with the tax credit. And although data companies don’t calculate a median 
return for this group of funds — saying they’re not a comparable peer group 
because they invest in such a diverse range of companies — about half the 
funds showed negative compound annual returns over various periods ended 
mid-2008.
 
If you’re undeterred by labour funds’ shaky tax status and the considerable 
investment risks, be cautious and put no more than 5 percent of your money 
here — okay, 10 percent if your idea of a quiet evening out is partying hard at 
the greyhound track in a low-cut dress or snakeskin suit, clutching a fistful of 
grubby $20 bills.
Examining why these funds 
get a tax break
Labour funds operate under special rules. The concept was introduced in the 
1990s, growing out of talks between the federal government and unions on how 
to back small businesses, which are a major source of new jobs. In return for 
the lavish tax breaks given to their investors, the funds must have an affiliation 
with a union or employee association, but in fact the connection between most 
labour-sponsored funds and organized labour is tenuous at best.
The main point is that labour funds buy into small Canadian businesses that 
would otherwise have trouble attracting investors — in return for taking on 
such a big risk, the unitholders get some generous tax breaks. Sometimes, 
they concentrate on backing businesses that have a track record of earn-
ings and revenue, and some labour funds even seek out companies that are 
already listed on a stock exchange, but often the little companies in these 
funds tend to have a very high failure rate. In general, the small companies 
backed by the funds are supposed to have fewer than 500 employees and less 
than $50 million in assets.

272
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Understanding the risks
Venture capital investing is notoriously risky and unpredictable, meaning 
that it will almost certainly take several years for the investments your fund 
has bought into to show any kind of profit. Venture capitalists like to talk 
about a “Rule of 10.” By that, they mean that a portfolio of venture invest-
ments will often contain two big winners, two so-so performers, and six that 
end up being taken down quietly to the river in a black plastic sack. But when 
venture investing is hot, it can really cook.
You can’t predict in advance which labour fund will hit the mother lode, how-
ever, so improve your chances by buying at least two. Most funds will let you 
invest as little as $1,000 or even $500, so you won’t have a problem dividing 
up your money. Your broker may beef about the extra paperwork, and hold-
ing multiple funds is more bother for you, but this is an area where having 
plenty of hooks in the water by owning several funds is essential.
A big problem with labour funds is lack of choice if you live outside Ontario. A 
few are available for sale in several provinces, giving investors the 15-percent 
federal tax credit, but some provincial governments don’t give purchasers of 
those funds a matching provincial credit.
 
Expenses are stiff with this group, with management expense ratios raging from 
just under 3 percent to an incredible 10 percent-plus. That’s really expensive. 
At that rate, a labour fund siphons off almost half your money in just ten years, 
which means these funds had better earn big returns to earn their keep. And the 
expenses look even worse when you consider that some funds have invested 
only half their money — meaning that some are levying fees and expenses that 
amount to 10 percent of the money they’ve actually put into small companies. 
From an investor’s point of view, the only justification for accepting such high 
expenses is the chance of earning huge returns if one of the funds’ venture 
investments explodes in value.
Labouring toward the right fund
Here are the main points to bear in mind when picking a labour fund:
 
 Think small: Look for a smallish one with assets of less than $200 mil-
lion. Any larger than that, and it’ll be hard for any one super-successful 
investment to have much of an influence on returns. If you live in 
Ontario, you’re spoiled for choice because more than a dozen funds 
offer both federal and provincial tax credits. In the rest of the country, 
however, you may have to settle for the local provincial fund if you want 
to get back the full 30-percent refund.

273
 Chapter 18: Funds Oddities: Strange Brews Sometimes Worth Tasting
 
 Remember the risk: Remember that this is risky investing, suitable for 
5 to 10 percent of your portfolio at most. Some commentators advise, 
sensibly, that you take the entire tax refund you get from investing in 
a labour fund and invest it in a solid common stock fund, a guaranteed 
investment certificate, or even a bond fund. That way, if the labour fund 
turns out to be a dud, you’ll probably earn a decent return on some of 
the money.
 
 Check the fund’s baggage: As always, check the fund’s main holdings 
and read its literature carefully. Even the bland brochures should give 
you an idea of what the fund’s main goal is — creating jobs or earning 
big returns for investors. After that, it’s your choice as to what you think 
is more important. If you’re buying more than one labour fund — and 
we recommend you do — try to get funds with different styles. Some 
specialize in technology stocks while others concentrate on relatively 
mature companies that are close to issuing shares to the public or have 
already listed on a stock exchange.
 
 Recognize the reality of the return: Don’t get all worked up by promises 
of fabulous extra tax savings if you buy the units and put them into an 
RRSP — RRSP savings are available on any mutual fund, stock, or bond. 
Labour fund ads tout the tax credits and then, in big black letters, also 
talk about the extra deduction available for buying the units through 
an RRSP. But despite lavish ads and eye-popping figures, labour funds 
are nothing special in that regard. Just about every fund can be put into 
an RRSP.
Making an eight-year commitment
 
Don’t bother with labour funds unless you’re absolutely sure you won’t need 
the money back for years. That’s because of that eight-year hold period. 
Remember, if you cash out within that time frame you’ll not only have to repay 
your federal tax credits, but also, in some cases, shell out redemption fees to 
the fund company.
Labour funds are suited only for your very long-term money for another 
reason: The value of venture capital investments traditionally forms a “J curve” 
(picture a hockey stick). In other words, a holding often doesn’t increase in 
value for several years — it may even drop — but it can suddenly shoot up 
when a deal is struck to either sell the business to a bigger company or take 
the investment public by listing its shares on a stock exchange. If you cash out 
too soon, you risk missing out on the payoff, leaving other investors to collect 
the big profits.

Target Date Funds: A Gimmick that 
Might Make Sense
Canada’s population is aging. Too many baby boomers. Our big challenge is to 
find a way to quit working before our eyesight and typing skills fail, and not 
have to live in a hovel on a diet of pet food. Perhaps by owning target date funds 
we’ll be spared a never-ending career and/or an undignified retirement — or so 
proponents of such funds would have us believe.
A target date fund is a balanced fund of funds with an investment mandate 
focused on an end date — in theory, within five years of the investor’s pro-
jected retirement date. Eleven fund companies offered these products as of 
mid-2008, with target dates at five-year intervals ranging from 2010 to 2045, 
depending on the company. A fund that’s close to the stated retirement date 
will have fixed-income and cash, and one that is many years away will hold 
mostly equities. (Figure 18-1 illustrates how portfolios differ, depending on 
how near retirement is.) Some funds will begin paying out cash distributions 
during the last few years ahead of the maturity date. Essentially, life-cycle 
funds do what you and or your adviser should be doing in managing an 
investment portfolio over the years, assuming your goal is to have all the 
money available (cashable) when retirement begins.

Considering your options
The longest-standing life-cycle mutual funds are IA Clarington’s Target series, 
launched in early 2005. (Primerica Canada has a series of five life-cycle seg-
regated funds that date back to 1994.) Three of the big banks (BMO, CIBC, 
and Scotia) have offerings in this category. (RBC has three similar funds, but 
they are aimed at funding post-secondary education, not retirement.) The 
other life-cycle players are AIM Trimark, Ethical Funds, Fidelity, London Life, 
Mackenzie, and Russell Investments.
The largest life-cycle mutual fund as of mid-2008 was BMO Life Stage Plus 
2015, launched in June 2007. In just one year, this fund had amassed assets of 
more than $630 million. Not surprisingly, more assets are in funds with end 
dates that occur sooner (2010 to 2025) than are in the longer-term funds.
CIBC and Scotia offer two different fund portfolios for each of their life-cycle 
funds. CIBC’s are either “conservative” or “moderate,” and Scotia’s versions 
are “conservative” and “aggressive.” Table 18-1 compares the holdings in the 
Scotia Vision Conservative and Aggressive 2020 Portfolios.

Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
With the retirement date just seven years away, the 2015 aggressive portfolio 
has a higher cash position than its 2020 counterpart and the U.S. and inter-
national equity portion is lower. These make the portfolio less risky as the 
fund’s liquidation date nears.
AIM Trimark launched its four Invesco Trimark Retirement Payout Portfolio 
funds in mid-2008. (Invesco is the name of its U.S.–based parent company.) 
They’re different from the rest of the category because, in addition to 
actively managed AIM Trimark funds, their portfolios include five of Invesco’s 
“tilted” exchange-traded funds. So a component of their return is based on 
the performance of U.S. and international stock indices — although as tilted 
funds they don’t mirror the exact stock weightings of the underlining index. 
(Chapter 15 gives you the straight goods on tilted ETFs.)
In addition to its ClearPath group, Fidelity also has funds that take over after 
retirement. Its Income Replacement funds are structured to provide a regular 
income stream during retirement. Eleven portfolios (sold in three formats, 
depending on how you buy them) are available for terms of 10 to 30 years, 
ending in odd-numbered years. As with conventional life-cycle funds, the 
Income Replacement fund portfolios are built using individual Fidelity funds. 
Each fund’s holdings are adjusted over time to ensure a monthly income 
stream is maintained as the maturity date draws closer.
Knowing what to look for
 
The life-cycle-fund concept is quite straightforward and serves as a structured 
and disciplined retirement investment program. Check for annual expenses, 
though. In some cases, MERs are fairly reasonable, considering the life-cycle 
portfolio adjustment service that’s included. Ideally, a life-cycle fund’s MER 
should reflect the fees of the underlying funds it holds. For example, CIBC’s 
Sequence funds hold funds from the bank’s Renaissance family. Two-thirds of 
the Sequence Conservative 2010 Fund is in Renaissance fixed-income funds 
with MERs below 2 percent. The remainder is in Canadian and U.S. equity 
funds with MERs ranging from 2.3 to 2.6 percent. The Sequence fund’s MER 
seems a bargain at 2.12 percent. Even the most aggressive Sequence fund’s 
MER is below 2.5 percent, despite being more heavily weighted in equity funds 
with higher MERs.
The question remains, though: Can a life-cycle fund provide the asset alloca-
tion and investment selection best suited to your specific retirement goals? 
For some, shopping for one-size-fits-all garments works, while others insist on 
a precise size. You need to decide what’s right for you.

 Chapter 18: Funds Oddities: Strange Brews Sometimes Worth Tasting
Funds with Trendy and 
Focused Mandates
The funds we discuss in this chapter are unusual, but they’re numerous and 
mainstream enough to merit their own fund categories. Things get really 
wild and woolly in the mutual fund data surveyors’ “specialty” category. 
You can imagine how oddball these funds are when they can’t be placed in 
the more than three dozen categories established by the data providers. If 
some of these funds didn’t include such intriguing names as Kyoto Planet and 
Criterion U.S. Buyback, they’d be lost in this classification backwater.
Some of the names reflect mandates that are in vogue, such as extreme 
income orientations or environmentally conscious investing. Other funds 
simply are so focused on a specific subsector they could not be classified 
among equity funds that invest in broader sectors.
The trendy nature of most of these funds means they’re fleetingly popu-
lar, which suggests these funds might make poor short-term investments. 
However, if you feel strongly about investing in improving the world’s ecolog-
ical situation or renewing infrastructure, then nothing’s wrong with making a 
“feel good” investment of, say, 5 percent or even 10 percent of your portfolio. 
As for funds with ultra-specific mandates, if you’re able to understand the 
concepts behind their investment mandates, go for it — but tread very care-
fully and limit your investment to no more than 5 percent.
Here’s a sampling of trendy and ultra-focused fund offerings:
 
 Extreme environmental funds: Plenty of green funds exist out there 
with investment strategies mainstream enough to merit classification 
in the various equity categories. However, some have more special-
ized mandates, so they are in the specialty category. Among these are 
the aforementioned Kyoto Planet, which invests globally in renewable 
energy and clean technology industries. It’s not classified as a global 
equity fund because its mandate allows it to engage in short selling. 
(Short selling is an aggressive investing technique in which an investor 
“borrows” stock from a brokerage firm’s inventory and sells it with the 
hope of repurchasing it at a lower price.)
 
 Scotia Global Climate Change invests in companies around the world 
that are “expected to profit from direct or indirect actions taken by such 
companies to mitigate the impact of climate change on the environ-
ment.” The fund’s mandate is so broad within the climate-change area 
that the data providers classified it as a specialty fund.

278
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
 Two funds even focus specifically on the water infrastructure “indus-
try.” In fact, one of them — Claymore S&P Global Water ETF — is an 
exchange-traded fund based on the S&P Global Water Index. The invest-
ment strategy might be a tad undiversified, but at least the annual 
expenses are minuscule, at 0.6 percent.
 
 Infrastructure funds: The developing world needs to expand and 
modernize its infrastructure, and this represents a huge opportunity 
for the industrial world’s construction companies, utilities, and other 
firms involved in infrastructure design and implementation. Although 
the stated mandates of funds like Investors Global Infrastructure refer 
to infrastructure work done in foreign countries — often by North 
American firms — nothing says this or similar funds couldn’t invest 
in companies engaged in rebuilding our own crumbling bridges, sewer 
systems, and other outdated public facilities.
 
 Ultra-specific mandates: Some funds’ mandates are uber-specific — so 
minutely focused on one investment area or strategy they’re probably 
best left alone in their unique little fiefdoms. But, just so you know, 
you can actually buy a fund that focuses on investing in shares of stock 
exchanges (Caldwell Exchange Fund), or one that “takes advantage of 
the current under-valuations in the late private or early public markets” 
(Marquis Bridge Fund), or even one focused exclusively in floating rate 
debt instruments (Trimark Floating Rate Income).

S
egregated funds — also sometimes known as “guaranteed investment 
funds” — are investment funds that promise to at least refund an inves-
tor’s original investment as long as the investor stays in the fund for ten years 
or, well, dies. Fund salespeople who’ve gone forth to pitch them to cautious 
older customers have found that the super-safe funds are quite popular — with 
the investors’ kids, who don’t want to see their inheritance wiped out because 
Mom couldn’t resist the allure of Brazilian junk-bond funds.
Segregated funds have attracted billions of dollars from customers who just 
can’t bear the thought of losing their investments in the capital markets. In 
return, they’re willing to pay much higher annual costs, as seg funds have 
management expense ratios that can be more than 1 percent higher than 
a nearly identical mutual fund. Investors are willing to swallow this extra 
charge for a guarantee that some observers argue is of dubious worth. 
The cost of this guarantee is inflated by tough rules that require insurers 
to set aside a sizeable amount of capital to cover the cost of these funds’ 
guarantees. As of mid-2008, approximately 2,700 — or one-third — of the 
nearly 8,500 fund choices on sale in Canada were seg funds. However, seg 
fund assets totaled about $91 billion, compared with more than $730 billion 
invested in mutual funds.
In this chapter, we explain the main differences between segregated (or guar-
anteed funds) and regular mutual funds, set out some of the main advantages 
and drawbacks of seg funds, and offer a few guidelines to help you decide 

280
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
whether they’re right for you. Throughout, we use the expression “seg funds” 
for both segregated funds and guaranteed investment funds (guaranteed 
funds is the term used by Manulife Financial, Toronto-Dominion, and some 
other seg-fund sponsors). Both terms mean essentially the same thing: funds 
that promise to refund most or all of an investor’s initial outlay, if held for 
long enough.
Hang On to Your Hats: The Rise 
of the Segregated Fund
Segregated funds: What a steamy, exotic name. Surely only those wacky 
knockabout jesters in life insurance could have come up with such an excit-
ing term. For years, they sold a sort of grey version of a mutual fund, often 
wrapped inside impenetrable life-insurance policies. The funds’ assets were 
kept separated or “segregated” from those of the life insurance company 
itself, hence the name.
In principle, seg funds were much the same as mutual funds: Investors looking 
for growth from stocks or steady returns from bonds pooled their money in a 
professionally managed fund and were issued units, representing ownership 
of the pool, that were supposed to increase in value. Often these funds were 
marketed as part of frequently incomprehensible “whole life” or “universal life” 
insurance policies that were supposed to provide an investment return as well 
as protection for the customer’s family.
Security with segs
Seg funds offered one advantage that their flashier Porsche-driving, model-
dating, mutual fund rivals couldn’t match. Regulated as insurance products, 
not investments, seg funds came with an attractive guarantee to refund at 
least 75 percent of an investor’s money, as long as he or she stayed invested 
in the fund for a set period. This guarantee was passed on to the holder’s 
estate in the event of the investor’s death. In other words, when the funds were 
cashed in at the time of the holder’s death, the heirs got at least 75 percent of 
the amount that was originally invested or the market value, whichever was 
higher.
The popularity of segs sag
The rising popularity of mutual funds in the late 1990s, with their 
easy-to-understand unit prices and relatively strong returns, left life 
insurers and their dreary complicated seg funds in the shade. Seg funds 

281
 Chapter 19: Segregated Funds: Investing on Autopilot
were usually managed extremely cautiously and they were loaded down with 
heavy expenses. Another big problem was the difficulty in figuring out what 
exactly you were buying: an investment or life insurance? The public, tired of 
carnivorous life insurance salespeople, listened avidly as a host of financial 
authors and other gurus told them to “buy term and invest the rest.” The 
theory, which is generally a good one, goes like this: Why buy some compli-
cated life insurance product loaded down with weird concepts like “com-
muted value” and “vanishing premiums” when you have no real way to be 
sure you’re getting value for money? As for comparing the endlessly complex 
“whole life” policies from different companies, you might as well try to teach 
raccoons to play rugby.
So, the experts advised, just protect your loved ones by buying straightfor-
ward, cheap, term life insurance for a simple monthly premium and use the 
savings, which would otherwise have vanished into a whole-life policy, to buy 
regular mutual funds. That way, you’re clear on exactly what you own and 
what you’re paying. As you know we’re keen on simplicity, so we agree with 
the strategy.
 
If you’re a self-employed businessperson or if you have complicated tax needs, 
life insurance still can offer some important tax-sheltering and estate-planning 
benefits. So a place for “whole life” coverage still exists in some cases. Just 
make sure, though, that you get help in this area from a fee-paid professional 
such as an accountant, and don’t fall for the blandishments of a commission-
collecting sales rep.
A fancy fund makeover
In the late 1990s, two interesting things happened. Life insurance companies 
started selling seg funds that looked like mutual funds — and mutual fund com-
panies started selling seg-fund versions of their mutual funds. Manulife Financial 
got the ball rolling by launching funds that essentially took well-known mutual 
funds from big partners such as AIM Trimark Investments, AGF Management 
Ltd., and Fidelity Investments Canada Ltd. and wrapped them in a nice cozy 
“guaranteed investment fund” blanket that pledged to return at least all the 
investors’ original outlay if they died or if they held the funds for ten years.
The fund industry soon struck back, with CI Investments Inc. launching segre-
gated versions of its own funds in partnership with a life insurance company. 
Other mutual fund players followed suit, launching seg versions of their mutual 
funds on which a life insurance company provided the guarantee. Soon, life insur-
ance companies were scrambling to jazz up their stale seg offerings by forming 
partnerships with fund companies or hiring fancy managers of their own.
In the old days, seg funds were generally grey collections of blue-chip stocks 
and bonds, run by pallid people who took commuter trains every night at 
5:30 sharp to their identical houses in far-off places with inspiring names 

282
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
like Milton, Ontario. But soon after the millennium, the insurance industry 
came up with much more exciting products, including seg funds that invest 
in emerging markets, health sciences, resource companies, the technology-
crazed Nasdaq stock market, and Asian stocks. Government regulators 
noticed, and started to wonder whether life insurance companies had enough 
money to make good on the guarantees they had attached to these relatively 
volatile funds. They got so worried, in fact, that they forced companies to set 
aside extra piles of cash to cover the potential cost of providing these risky 
guarantees to investors.
Seg Fund Essentials
We outline the main features of seg funds here. Note that most of these 
funds technically count as insurance contracts, which means they involve a 
whole new set of jargon and concepts. We introduce some of the new terms 
as we go along (we know it’s exciting, but please try to stay in your seat), 
but remember that this short description can’t hope to cover every seg fund 
from every company.
Guaranteeing the return of your 
initial investment
 
The essential point with seg funds is their ten-year guarantee. In insurance 
lingo, when you buy a seg fund you’ve bought a “contract” that “matures” 
in ten years. It doesn’t matter how you hold the fund: in a taxable account 
or a registered retirement savings plan (or some other kind of tax-sheltered 
account). The guarantee usually states that no matter what happens to the 
fund or the markets in the decade following your purchase, after ten years 
you’re entitled to get back at least the amount of money you put into the fund 
or the market value of your units, whichever is greater.
Say, for instance, you bought $10,000 worth of a fund that proceeded to 
have an awful ten years, slashing the value of your holding to $8,000. After 
the period, you can go to the fund company and get your $10,000 back. If, 
by contrast, the fund does reasonably well, doubling the value of your hold-
ing to $20,000, then you get the $20,000. Under insurance law, the guarantee 
must be for at least 75 percent of your investment, but many insurers and 
fund companies have boosted that to 100 percent for marketing reasons. 
However, the tough rules introduced in 2000 forced many companies to scale 
the guarantee back to 75 percent again, although a good selection of funds 
with a 100-percent guarantee is still available.

283
 Chapter 19: Segregated Funds: Investing on Autopilot
Living longer than you might
The investment-principal guarantee also applies when the annuitant (that is, 
the person whose life has been insured) named in the contract dies. In that 
case, the value of the seg fund units is paid to the policy’s beneficiary (the 
person selected to get the death benefit). No matter when the policy was 
bought, the amount paid out to the beneficiary is subject to the guarantee. 
He or she gets either the original investment or the market value at the time 
of death, whichever is more.
Note that the so-called guarantee is pretty limited. It applies only after ten 
years or upon death. If you sell your fund units at any other time, you get 
only the market value, even if it’s less than your purchase price. Whining to 
the fund company if the value of your units has collapsed after three years is 
pointless. They’ll just make a sympathetic little face, give you an attractive 
key ring, and tell you to come back in seven years.
Enabling you to reset the value 
of successful funds
A popular feature with most of the newer seg funds was the ability to “reset” 
the amount covered by the guarantee, often up to twice a year. For example, 
say you put $10,000 into a technology-based seg fund and saw the value of 
your investment soar to $13,000 in six months. You could reset the value 
of your contract at the higher amount, so you’re guaranteed to get back at 
least $13,000 after ten years (or your estate is guaranteed to get back at least 
$13,000 when you die).
The only drawback: Resetting the contract starts the clock ticking again, 
so you have to wait a full ten years, not nine and a half, before the contract 
matures. Reset features — which greatly increase the risk of seg funds for 
insurance companies — were a prime reason for the regulatory crackdown.
Offering asset protection
For self-employed businesspeople or professionals who potentially face law-
suits from creditors, segregated funds can be an excellent way to protect 
assets. Because they’re an insurance contract, seg funds are normally out 
of the reach of creditors, as long as a spouse, parent, child, or grandchild is 
named as the beneficiary or the beneficiary has been named “irrevocably” 
(that is, their written consent must be obtained to name a new beneficiary).

284
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
Watch out, though: The beneficiary of seg funds held in an RRSP must be revo-
cable or the investments lose their registered status. And the protection from 
creditors doesn’t apply where a debtor has cynically shovelled assets into seg 
funds just to get out of paying obligations. This is a complex area, so talk to 
your lawyer before making decisions.
Giving to your heir apparent 
without the hassle
Seg funds are a great way of passing money on to heirs without hassle or fees 
(apart from redemption charges if you bought the funds on a deferred-load 
basis). Again, because they count as life insurance, the proceeds from seg 
funds are paid directly to your heirs when you die; they do not pass through 
your estate. That means the money escapes provincial probate fees, a sort of 
death tax in all provinces except Quebec that can run as high as 1.5 percent. 
And the money is usually paid out to the beneficiaries immediately, with-
out the holdups that can plague the settlement of estates. Normal bequests 
are public documents, but seg fund contracts are private, so you can leave 
money to a charity or individual without Nosey Parker finding out about it.
 
Seg funds avoid probate fees, but they can be less tax-efficient than regular 
mutual funds when the holder dies. Normally, investment assets pass to a 
spouse with no taxes payable immediately on capital gains that have been 
earned. But a seg fund is considered to be a trust for tax purposes, so gains 
earned in these funds may be taxable. Be sure to talk to a knowledgeable 
accountant.
 
Because seg funds are life insurance contracts, you must buy them from an 
adviser who is licensed to sell life insurance, which means that not every 
financial planner or broker may be able to help you. However, more and more 
brokers and planners are taking the necessary courses to qualify to sell insur-
ance, or they refer their clients to a colleague or local insurance agent or 
broker who can sell seg funds.
A Grim Reminder with 
Some Helpful Hints
Now, we know journalists are always producing sensationalist scare stories, 
but hear us out. As you get older, it becomes more likely you’ll die in the near 
future.

285
 Chapter 19: Segregated Funds: Investing on Autopilot
 
At 45, a Canadian woman has an approximately 2.5-percent chance of dying 
in the next ten years, while a Canadian man has a 4-percent likelihood. At 55, 
it rises to 6 percent for women and 10 percent for men. By 65, it shoots up to 
15 percent and 26 percent, respectively. And at 75, Canadian women have a 
38-percent chance of dying in the next decade — but for men, well, the chance 
they’ll be throwing a seven in the great craps game of life before ten lacrosse 
seasons have come and gone is 55 percent. (Those figures, by the way, are 
based on Statistics Canada numbers reported by mathematicians Moshe 
Milevsky and Thomas Salisbury in a 2006 study, Asset Allocation and the 
Transition to Income: The Importance of Product Allocation in the Retirement 
Risk Zone.)
The fact that older investors are more likely to die means it gets riskier for 
the fund companies to guarantee a refund of the amount they put into a seg 
fund. So, many companies reduce or restrict the guarantee for older inves-
tors. For example, some don’t allow resets of the death benefit guarantee 
when the annuitant has turned 75. And when the annuitant has turned 90, the 
death benefit guarantee may be reduced.
 
Mutual funds must obtain their unitholders’ consent to increase fees, but seg 
funds are pretty well free to charge what they like. Seg funds are complicated 
beasts, and their “information folders,” the prospectus-like documents that set 
out their features, are tough to read. You have to buy them through a licensed 
insurance salesperson, so take your time and find an experienced agent or 
broker whom you trust. You’ll need an expert on your side to figure out the 
often-horrendous complexities.
Figuring Out How Much 
this Certainty Costs
How much extra do you pay for the guarantee? For volatile funds, the difference 
can be several percentage points of your investment each year — slicing into 
returns like a giant weighted machete cutting rancid butter — but if you shop 
aggressively and buy sane, high-quality funds, you may be able to get the cov-
erage at a reasonable cost. Check out Table 19-1, which shows the median (or 
midpoint) annual management expense ratio (MER) for regular mutual funds 
and then segregated funds in five key categories.
One of the things that makes insurance companies most nervous is, clearly, 
foreign stock investing, with its added risk in the form of currency swings — on 
global equity seg funds, insurers cost almost 0.6 of a percentage point more. 
For investments closer to home, they get less cagey.

286
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
On Canadian balanced funds, normally a fairly stable stew of bonds and 
stocks, insurers apparently ask less than half of a percentage point in extra 
MER. They charge roughly the same premium for providing the (limited, 
remember) pledge on Canadian stocks. Of course, looking at category medi-
ans or averages doesn’t highlight some examples of seg funds with pretty 
spectacular MERs. How does 5.8 percent annually on the seg version of a 
Toronto-Dominion Bank health-industry fund sound? That’s half your money 
in a decade. The mutual version of the same fund charges an MER less than 
one-half as much. This, of course, demonstrates the cost of insuring an 
investment in a risky investment area like biotechnology. As for bond funds, 
charging an annual premium of more than one-half of a percentage point to 
guarantee against losses might seem exorbitant, given the relatively low vola-
tility of bond portfolios. Nonetheless, buying some kind of guarantee might 
well be a good idea if inflation returns in a big way, potentially sending bond 
prices tumbling for years.
The gap between mutual and seg money market funds is smaller — 0.35 of 
a percentage point. Yet this seems severe when you consider the safety of 
this type of investment. Money market seg funds exist only for the purpose 
of keeping an investor’s money within a particular fund family, thus avoiding 
switch-out fees for an investor who wants to park his or her money and later 
reinvest within that family of seg funds.
Reality check for seg funds
Check out how one segregated fund has fared 
against the normal mutual funds it’s supposed 
to track. Manulife Financial launched its MLI 
Fidelity Canadian Asset Allocation GIF Fund 1 in 
1997. The fund was pitched as a conservative 
way to achieve much the same performance as 
the Fidelity Canadian Asset Allocation Fund, a 
fund that switches among stocks, bonds, and 
cash in an effort to achieve high total returns.
At the cost of a higher MER, currently 3.41 per-
cent compared with 2.28 percent for the Fidelity 
fund, investors in the GIF got the usual guaran-
teed return of at least their original investment 
after ten years or upon death. The Fidelity fund, 
by contrast, could in theory lose money over 
ten years, leaving unitholders in the red. The 
Manulife GIF funds were a huge marketing 
success: By the end of 1999, Manulife Fidelity 
Canadian Asset Allocation GIF’s assets had 
ballooned to $750 million, making it Canada’s 
seventh-biggest seg fund at that time.
The GIF hasn’t done a bad job of tracking the 
Fidelity fund. As of March 2008, an investor who 
put $10,000 into the fund on inception (January 
1997) was sitting on $22,338, or a cumulative 123 
percent return on his or her investment. The 
same $10,000 investment in the Fidelity fund 
grew to $24,689, or 145 percent. In other words, 
the Manulife fund has done a reasonable job of 
tracking the Fidelity fund, with the difference in 
returns attributable to its extra annual costs of 
more than a percentage point.

Taking a Closer Look at 
the “Deal” with Segs
Many commentators have argued forcefully that those costly guarantees 
are ripoffs when it comes to bond funds and of dubious benefit for balanced 
funds, which are supposed to be sedate portfolios that avoid losses. After all, 
in the 25 full calendar years from 1983 through 2007, the median Canadian 
fixed-income mutual fund lost money only twice, a drop of 6.1 percent in 1994 
and another of 2.2 percent in 1999. The median Canadian neutral balanced 
mutual fund had only four losing years, falling 1.9 percent in 1990, 3.1 percent 
in 1994, 1 percent in 2001, and 5.4 percent in 2002.
 
Given the long-term tendency of stocks to rise, it’s rare, too, to find any kind of 
equity fund that loses money over ten years. That makes it unlikely you’ll ever 
need to collect on the ten-year maturity guarantee (which promises to at least 
refund your investment if you’ve held the fund for a decade). Among equity 
funds of significant size — we’ll define these as those with assets of $100 
million or more — only 23 of 236 failed to make money during the ten years 
ended February 2008.
 
Admittedly, a lot of flea-bitten funds get buried within median and average sta-
tistics, as a result of the fund industry’s habit of quietly folding underperform-
ers into their better-performing sister funds. This “survivorship bias,” which 
results in merged and otherwise discontinued funds — many of them truly 
awful — vanishing from the record, is notorious for casting a rosy glow over 
the industry’s performance past. However, data firm Morningstar calculates 
indices that wipe out survivorship bias and, equally important, produce a 
weighted average return for all mutual fund categories. (We take a closer look 
at the Morningstar Canada Fund Indices in Chapter 21.)

288
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
If you decide high-MER seg funds are a scam because mutual funds rarely lose 
money over a decade, you may be missing the point. Over shorter periods 
mutual funds are perfectly capable of losing money, and lots of it. Some 80 of 472 
equity funds lost money over the three years ended February 2008. For older 
investors who are worried about dying just as their funds are going into the tank, 
taking thousands of dollars off the value of their estate, a segregated fund guar-
antee is mighty comforting. At least on death the full value of the original invest-
ment goes to the heirs (not that we’d give the slack-jawed gum-chewing brats 
anything, but that’s just crusty old lovable Andrew’s take on things).
To Seg or Not to Seg: Are They for You?
 
The bottom line with seg funds is almost certainly that they’re best suited for 
older or unwell investors who have a reasonable probability of passing away 
in the next few years. Seg funds’ protection from creditors also makes them 
very attractive to self-employed businesspeople and entrepreneurs.
Here are two examples, adapted from material produced by AIM Trimark, of 
older investors who seem well suited for seg funds.
The first is a 67-year-old woman with four nieces and three nephews to 
whom she wants to leave money without legal hassles and probate fees. She 
puts $50,000 into a seg fund. If she dies after five years and the value of her 
deposit has risen to $85,000, her beneficiaries get $85,000, minus any with-
drawals or redemption fees if she bought the funds on a back-end-load basis. 
But say the market has slumped and the value of her contract is only $43,000. 
Then her beneficiaries get the guaranteed amount of $50,000, again minus 
redemption fees.
The other example is a 61-year-old, self-employed engineer who’s two years 
from retirement. He’s repelled by the low interest rates available on guaran-
teed investment certificates but he doesn’t want to put his money at risk just 
before he retires. So he invests $100,000 in seg funds. If it grows to $230,000 
in ten years, when the contract matures, he gets $230,000. But if the value of 
his fund drops to $80,000 at maturity, he gets his original $100,000, minus any 
withdrawals.
Then consider the estate-planning advantages of seg funds, especially the rela-
tive simplicity of passing on money to a beneficiary by simply putting it in a 
seg fund. Don’t get too excited about saving on probate fees, though, because 
the higher management fees on seg funds will quickly wipe out that advantage.
 
Choosing a seg fund really comes down to the famous “pillow factor.” Just 
how well can you sleep at night knowing your money is in danger? If you’re 
really afraid of losses, then seg funds may well be your thing, despite their 
higher management expense ratio. The emotional security is sometimes worth 
the higher MERs.

e’re always being hassled and badgered to think for ourselves in our 
workplaces — so isn’t it nice to just regress to a vegetative state once 
in a while? Well, mutual fund companies and stockbrokers are keen students 
of human weakness and they’ve noticed that many investors like to be pre-
sented with simple one-decision products that they can just buy and forget 
about.
Hence the emergence of fund packages, also known as wraps and funds of

These funds are nice and simple to pitch. And because they have built-in

The Flavours Fund Packages Come In
A fund package is a group of individual mutual funds selected by a fund com-
pany or money manager for the purpose of providing the investor with a 
diversified fund portfolio in a single product. It’s structured as an individual 
fund (or “wrap”) that has a portfolio made up only of individual mutual 
funds, usually drawn from the sponsoring firm’s fund lineup. Depending on 
its investment objectives, a package typically will hold one or more equity 
funds, a bond fund, and a money market fund (as the cash component).
Fund companies, banks, stockbrokers, insurance companies, fund managers, 
and financial planning firms have come up with a bewildering range of fund 
combinations that claim to take care of your every need, eliminating the need 
to pick and choose your own funds. Sometimes these are called “managed 
accounts.”
Checking out the risk categories
Typically, before you’re sold a fund package, you’ll be asked to fill out a 
questionnaire that establishes how much risk you can stand and what 
sort of annual return you’re demanding. From there, the salesperson, bank 
employee, or fund company representative simply takes your money and 
sticks it into a suitable package, usually straight off the shelf but sometimes 
supposedly designed for your needs.
You’ll probably be offered something that falls into one of these three risk 
categories:
 
 Conservative: The safest packages of all, they’re all about conserv-
ing capital while offering a reasonable flow of income from bonds or 
Treasury bills, and perhaps the chance of some capital gains from 
stocks. (Remember that “income” in this context refers to the steady 
interest payments generated by bonds, money that you simply plow 
back into the same kind of investment.)
 
 These conservative packages are usually full of funds that invest in 
bonds — which are debts owed by governments and big companies — 
and money market securities — which are short-term borrowings by the 
government and large corporations.

 Moderate: The next step up on the volatility scale, these packages are 
pretty similar to the typical balanced fund. They’re for investors who 
don’t mind the occasional loss in return for the higher returns that stocks 
and long-term bonds offer. Generally, their mixture of stocks and bonds 
will be close to one-half each, with a cash anchor of about 5 percent.
 
 Growth: These packages own mostly stocks and typically have only 
a small portion of their assets, usually 25 percent or less, in bond and 
money market funds, with the rest in equities. You’ll be steered into 
these mixtures only if you’ve indicated on the questionnaire that you 
won’t be needing to cash in any of the investment for several years. If 
your “horizon” is long term, the theory goes, you shouldn’t be worried 
by a nasty dip in the value of your holdings in the short term.
 
 The most entertaining growth packages, naturally, are those with “aggres-
sive” in their name. Much as we love to think of these being bought by 
shaven-headed former paratroopers with drinking problems, it simply 
denotes a mixture that puts as little as 10 percent of your assets into bonds 
and holds lots of volatile stuff such as emerging markets and technology 
companies.
Check out Chapter 4, where we help you determine what type of investor you 
are. If you’re a saver, you’re best suited for a conservative package. Balanced 
investors, consider a moderate package. Growth packages, unsurprisingly, 
are best suited to growth investors.
Sticking with Canada or going global
Whether you stay true to the maple leaf or go global depends partly on what 
you think will happen to currencies, and of course on your time horizon. 
If the Canadian dollar tanks, then it would be better to have your money 
outside the country. If it goes up, then it’s better to keep a lot of your invest-
ments Canadian. But it’s impossible to know in advance what will happen to 
foreign exchange rates.
For short-term and medium-term savings, an all-Canadian package of invest-
ments is probably fine because you plan to spend the money relatively soon 
and you’ll be spending it in Canadian dollars. But with long-term equity pack-
ages, make sure you get at least some global stock action. It spreads your 
risk by giving you a more mixed bag of investments, and great companies to 
invest in exist all around the world. And you also need to protect yourself 
against a drop in the Canadian dollar.

Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
What to Find Out Before You Buy
Be sure to pose these stumpers to anyone who tries to peddle a fund portfolio 
to you. This section reviews the two essential questions to ask.
How much will this cost me?
With some of these preselected mixtures, you have to pay the regular fees 
and expenses of the funds included in the service plus an extra fee for the 
package itself that can run as high as 1 percent annually.
Adding another 1 percent in yearly costs is a heavy weight to put on your port-
folio, especially if some of the equity funds in the package already have man-
agement expense ratios (MERs) of more than 2.5 percent. Many brokers and 
financial planners sell their own private wrap or asset allocation products that 
use funds that charge low or no management fees. But in this case, the client 
pays a separate fee — often listed directly on her or his statement — to cover 
the asset allocation service.
 
In theory, costs you incur trying to earn investment income are tax-deductible, 
so you may be able to claim fund management fees against taxes. Some vendors 
like to make a big song and dance about this advantage. But that applies only to 
fees that are charged separately to the investor and not simply deducted from 
the fund. Ordinary mutual fund charges and fees are quietly taken out of the 
fund’s assets by the manager and can’t be claimed as a cost. However, though 
they’re not directly deductible, ordinary fees do reduce your taxable capital 
gains and income by cutting into the return you get from your funds, so the fees 
are ultimately deductible, too.
 
Although it’s great to see package fees broken down openly on your state-
ment instead of having them buried in the management expense ratio, make 
sure you realize what you’re paying — because it can be confusing. Funds 
that charge you expenses separately instead of taking them out of your annual 
return present another problem. Because they ignore expenses and costs 
when they report those returns, they’ll often seem to be doing better than 
funds that handle fees and costs in the normal way, by extracting them before 
they report performance.

293
 Chapter 20: Fund Packages: One-Stop Shopping
How do I know how 
well I’m doing?
Many of these services don’t publish their returns publicly, and even if they do 
the names are often so similar it can be hard to remember what you own. Some 
fund companies even establish a sort of imaginary unit price, simply for the 
purpose of calculating performance. That’s mostly because mutual fund data 
firms like Globe Interactive and Morningstar use special software for working 
out a fund’s returns. Essentially, their systems determine performance by cal-
culating the changes in the price of a unit, taking into account any distributions 
for unitholders along the way. For example, if you check out the portfolios 
available from CIBC, you’ll notice they have unit prices. In fact, when you buy 
into these services, you sometimes buy each fund in the package separately 
with its own unit price, in the normal way. The units shown for the package 
may simply be there for ease of calculating returns.
The account statement you receive semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly 
for any service should make your returns absolutely clear, so ask to see a 
sample before you sign up. Don’t be fobbed off by vague excuses. If the sales-
person or bank employee can’t demonstrate that your returns will be clearly 
reported, avoid the product.
The Upside of Fund Packages
The idea of simply handing over your cash to let professionals decide the 
asset mix can be wonderfully attractive. And fund packages offer a number of 
other important advantages:
 
 Dealing with only one fund company: You don’t have to juggle account 
statements and tax slips from several sellers. Most investors, with their 
busy lives, loathe getting piles of mail from fund companies.
 
 Automatic rebalancing: You don’t have to rejig your funds if strong 
returns or big losses throw the asset mix of your portfolio out of whack. 
Many packages are periodically rebalanced by the company so that cli-
ents don’t end up with too much of their money riding on just one type 
of investment.

294
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
 
 For example, say you’ve put $100,000 into a sedate portfolio made up 
equally of bond funds and stock funds. If the stock market slides by 
20 percent but interest rates stay unchanged, your stock funds will 
probably be worth $40,000 while your bond funds will still be worth 
$50,000. To maintain your 50/50 mix, the portfolio service will redeem 
about $5,000 worth of bond funds and put the money into stocks 
instead, to restore the equal balance.
 
 Charging reasonable fees: Because they use regular mutual funds that 
are subject to public scrutiny and fairly tight securities laws, the widely 
available fund packages charge fees that are usually reasonable, at least 
when you compare them to the charges that trust companies or lawyers 
can levy for looking after assets.
The Downside of Fund Packages
Letting someone else pick your funds for you does have its drawbacks. Here 
are a few:
 
 An unexciting way to invest: It’s boring and Big Brotherish. All you 
get is the same gruel-like return earned by everyone else who buys the 
same package, with no real clue as to which fund did well and which one 
barked your money away. It’s more interesting to be an informed con-
sumer who can tell that, for example, bonds were up while international 
equities were down, just by looking at your account statement.
 
 Extra costs: If extra costs are levied, they eat into your return, especially 
when tacked on top of the underlying mutual funds’ fees and expenses.
 
 Tax implications of rebalancing: The regular portfolio rebalancing by 
the fund company can trigger taxable capital gains distributions for 
investors holding the package of funds outside a tax-deferred account 
such as an RRSP. Fund companies maintain that these distributions will 
generally be small because they’re simply readjusting the asset mix 
rather than turning the fund inside out, but taxable payouts add unpre-
dictability and can cut into your real, after-tax return.
 
 Unreported returns: Be very wary before you buy into any fund or man-
aged investment whose returns and unit price aren’t published regularly 
in the newspapers. Remember, sunlight disinfects: If the performance 
isn’t publicly reported alongside that of big regular mutual funds, 
making comparisons simple, then you can never really be sure you’re 
not stuck with a dog.

295
 Chapter 20: Fund Packages: One-Stop Shopping
 
 Constricted by your funds: If you’re in pooled or house-brand funds 
that are sold only through a particular brokerage or financial planning 
firm, then moving your money elsewhere can be troublesome because 
your new broker or planner might be unwilling to add this fund to his or 
her product lineup. (A pooled fund is similar to a mutual fund, except it 
is sold on an institutional basis by offering memorandum rather than 
by prospectus, and requires a high minimum investment, often $300,000 
or more.)
 
 Great potential confusion: Working out how you’re doing or even what 
package you own can be tricky, given the confusing multiplicity of prod-
ucts with similar names. Web sites and brochures can be vague on how 
the systems actually work, and salespeople are hard-pressed to keep up 
with the flood of new offerings. And a whole bunch of transactions may 
be reported to you on your statement, just as though you had ordered 
them, when the portfolio is automatically rebalanced or a fund is 
dropped from the mixture. If you’re not completely sure you understand 
what you’re buying, better to steer clear.
 
Just about every fund seller claims that its asset allocation strategies are best, 
and comparing them is just about impossible. That’s because the returns 
produced by any system tell only half the story. The other half is how much 
risk did the portfolio take on and how violent were the swings. To provide a 
crude example, a portfolio that made 12 percent a year for five years might 
look superior to one that generated a return of just 6 percent annually. But if it 
turns out that the first portfolio was exclusively invested in super-risky, early-
stage, biotechnology shares while the second held mostly government bonds, 
then the second portfolio probably did a better job — earning a good profit 
relative to the low level of risk it incurred.
 
Before buying a fund package from a bank or other seller, try to get the goods on 
how well it’s been doing from a third-party online source like Morningstar.ca or 
Globefund.com. Before you hand over any money, make sure you can actually 
find the package at one of these sources. That way, you’ll be able to track your 
returns easily from month to month without relying solely on your account state-
ment from the company.
 
Don’t worry too much about trying to figure out the difference between one 
company’s Nervous Nellie Never-Lose-a-Penny-of-My-Money Portfolio and 
another fund seller’s Shaky Sue Can’t Stand the Slightest Suspicion of Suffering 
a Slump Asset Allocation Service. The big thing, as usual, is to look for low 
costs, so you know you’re getting reasonable value, and clear reporting so you 
at least know how you’re doing.

296
Part III: The Fund Stuff: Building a Strong Portfolio 
Steering Clear of the Hype
Packages have become an extremely popular product for financial advisers to 
sell. They transfer the investment selection decisions to portfolio-management 
experts within their firm or at a fund company of another third-party firm. The 
adviser’s main role is to help you determine the right asset allocation — the 
breakdown among equities, fixed income, and cash.
Advisers who pitch fund packages will extol the benefits of professional 
portfolio management and the discipline this brings. They will talk about 
portfolio “rebalancing,” which the package’s managers will take care of at 
regular intervals — often quarterly — to ensure the asset allocation is 
correct. Advisers will all but guarantee you are much better off in a package 
as opposed to a collection of individually selected funds. But take all such 
claims with a big swig of salty vinegar. Investment wizards are infallible only 
until they blow it, and the explosion can be spectacular. The market and 
economy have a delightful way of throwing weird slimy curveballs that 
completely fool the number-crunchers.
 
The truth is, when banks and other fund sellers pitch these packages, what 
they’re really trying to do is eliminate the need for you to pick any other fund 
seller’s wares. They’d much rather you stuck to their product line than mix 
and match funds from different sellers. So they offer their super-simple, off-
the-shelf packages that relieve you of the need to choose your mutual funds 
and that tempt you to go with their stuff.
Some companies even sell packages that also include other companies’ funds. 
Even Investors Group, the country’s biggest fund complex and a bastion of the 
in-house product approach, has packages that include third-party funds — funds 
from other managers. However, you’ll notice that third-party funds usually come 
from companies such as Fidelity Investments Canada or AGF Management that 
pay a sales commission to the people who put the package together. These pack-
ages may include good funds, but they also carry the same disadvantages as 
other pre-mixed fund selections. That is, their costs can be high and it’s hard to 
know which fund is doing well for you and which is sinking like a lead submarine.
Preselected packages of funds are convenient, but you’re not guaranteed that 
the fund company, bank, or broker has got the mix right. And the packages 
can make it hard to know how well you’re doing or even what exactly you own. 
Better to buy a varied selection of high-quality, low-cost funds, monitor the mix 
yourself, and adjust it when one asset class either soars or falls out of bed.

 Chapter 20: Fund Packages: One-Stop Shopping
Taking a Look at a Decent 
Fund Package
 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offers packages, under the Managed 
Portfolio nameplate, that are among the better buys. They impose no extra 
fees beyond the charges and costs of the underlying CIBC funds.
Table 20-1 gives a breakdown of how their balanced package invests — half in 
growth and half in income investments.
Down, boy
If the salesperson has sold his or her clients a 
pre-mixed package containing a selection of 
funds holding cash, bonds, and stocks, chances 
are that at least something in the casserole will 
be doing all right — so a dog’s slimy wet nose 
won’t stand out so much.
Fund packages offer another advantage for fund 
sellers: It’s easy to tell if an individual fund you 
own is an underperformer, but it’s pretty well 
impossible to tell if your pre-mixed fund pack-
age isn’t doing its job. That’s because packages 
are virtually impossible to compare with each 
other. These things use so many different rules 
and structures that they’re like lobsters and 
cantaloupes.
Meanwhile, quite a lot of nonsense gets said 
about the magical results of combining funds 
in these packages. Andrew once wrote the fol-
lowing about a fund in a Globe and Mail article: 
“You could travel to the worst-run Canadian Tire 
store in the country, root around at the back of 
the filthy warehouse and dig out the wettest 
and most disgusting bag of salt. Then you could 
dress up the salt in a suit and tie, and give it an 
expense account, a pair of wire-rim glasses, 
and a nice office in Winnipeg. And it would do a 
better job of picking U.S. stocks than these guys.” 
Someone from the company called Andrew to 
gripe that he was being unfair, because the fund 
fitted in some mystical way with the rest of the 
seller’s funds. But bad returns are bad returns, 
no matter how you cut ’em.

on’t get us wrong. The best place to start your fund familiarization jour-
ney is right here, reading this book in your favourite armchair or at the 
dining table, highlighting away. You won’t find a substitute for the comfort 
of hard copy when you’re first getting acquainted with a new and complex 
subject.
But after you’re done reading this book and it has taken on the appearance 
of an old shoe, the pages well worn from careful reading and notations, 
you need to roll up your sleeves, fire up that infernal machine, peer into 
the screen, move the mouse, tap on the keyboard — and get specific. The 
Internet has become, bar none, the place to find out about mutual funds. So 
while this book is a great place to get started, for the most up-to-date fund 
information, the Web is the place to be.
Independent Sources: Where to Get 
the Honest Goods
Third-party mutual fund Web sites are where to start your search. They’re per-
haps the most useful places to mine fund information because they don’t sell 
investments; their business is just providing you with information. The major 

302
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
sites let you set up a portfolio of funds — and, in some cases, other investment 
securities such as stocks and bonds. Fund and securities prices are updated 
daily, enabling you to track your investments — or any collection of investments 
you wish. In some cases, the Web sites can produce detailed charts and tables of 
one or more portfolios.
Taking a look at the top two
 
Globefund.com and Morningstar.ca are the country’s leading mutual fund 
information Web sites. Although some of you may want to check out other 
sites (we recommend a few later in this section), if you’d rather not bother, 
you’ll do fine with these two.
We’re trying to be objective here, but we need to come clean. Andrew is a 
host and commentator with the Business News Network (BNN), the finan-
cial news television outlet owned by CTV Globemedia, which also owns 
Globefund.com. Matthew used to work for Morningstar, and was in charge of 
the firm’s Web site content. Not to worry, though — most investors, advisers, 
and fund company people will agree that these Web sites (and the databases 
that fuel them, as well as affiliated but separate desktop software products) 
set the bar for mutual fund information in this country.
Globefund.com
You can easily find a fund at Globefund.com, which offers information on 
every mutual and segregated fund sold in Canada. You can look up an indi-
vidual fund by typing its name in the Search field, or search for funds by 
category or by sponsoring company. The site offers a detailed report for 
each fund, showing rates of return over the various periods ranging from one 
month to 20 years, portfolio asset allocation summaries by overall asset class 
(stocks, bonds, cash), geographic area and (for stocks) industry group, and 
the portfolio’s top-ten individual holdings. You can create charts of a fund’s 
performance over a variety of time frames, and compare it against a bench-
mark index.
The site rates funds that have a two-year or longer record according to its 
Globe Five Star system. Funds at the top of six categories get the highest 
rating. The categories are:
 
 Growth (primarily mid-size and large-cap Canadian equity funds)
 
 Growth and income (primarily balanced, dividend, and asset allocation 
funds)
 
 International growth (foreign equity funds)

303
 Chapter 21: The Internet: The Place to Go for Fund Information
 
 Aggressive growth (primarily small-cap, geographic, and specialty funds)
 
 Income (fixed income and mortgage funds)
 
 Capital preservation (Canadian and foreign money market funds)
In addition to following mutual funds, the site tracks more than 1,000 
Canadian and American exchange-traded funds at its useful ETF Centre.
 
Because they’re traded like stocks, you can buy ETFs in the United States even 
though you don’t live there, unlike mutual funds. (For more on ETFs, refer to 
Chapter 15.)
For stock and bond information, click over to Globeinvestor.com. If your 
portfolio includes both funds and individual securities, you can keep an eye 
on them in one spot using the Globe Portfolio system.
Globefund benefits hugely from the extensive resource of The Globe and 
Mail newspaper and its data affiliate Globe Interactive. In addition to having 
access to a sea of performance and other data, you can access recent articles 
on mutual funds from the newspaper, notably regular contributions from 
The Globe’s respected personal finance columnist Rob Carrick. You also get 
glimpses of editorial content from the GlobeInvestorGold.com “premium” 
(as in you have to pay for it) Web site, including articles by respected fund 
expert Gordon Pape.
 
Although Globefund.com provides most of what the typical fund investor 
needs, you can access a lot more information by subscribing to Globe
InvestorGold.com, including full access to articles on investing published 
in the newspaper. Look for the Globe Plus icons on Globefund.com to find 
out more.
Morningstar.ca
The Canadian unit of the longtime U.S. mutual fund tracking giant offers an 
array of data on the more than 8,000 mutual, segregated, and other investment 
funds sold in this country. This site is up to date and extremely comprehensive 
in its presentation.
Enter a fund’s name in the Search field and you’ll be treated to an impres-
sively detailed fund report. The Portfolio page provides a pie chart with the 
fund’s overall asset allocation (stocks, bonds, cash, and so on), followed by 
lists showing allocation among industry sectors and the top-25 individual 
securities holdings. You can get much of this information from other data 
providers, but go to Morningstar.ca to produce a (free) table comparing the 
asset allocation of all funds in a specific asset category.

304
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
Morningstar rates funds that have a track record of three years or longer, 
assigning one to five stars. Funds are rated in relation to their peers — other 
qualifying funds in their asset category, of which 42 exist. These categories 
are the official ones supervised by the Canadian Investment Funds Standards 
Committee, an independent group made up of database firm executives and 
other impartial industry observers. The rating is based on a risk-adjusted 
return, which combines rate of return and a risk measure based on the fund’s 
unit-value volatility.
 
In addition, you can peruse the Fund Analyst Picks — funds Morningstar’s ana-
lysts have deemed to be worth a serious look. This process goes far beyond 
the firm’s well-known Morningstar Ratings, because they are chosen based on 
not just their numbers but also a qualitative review by the analyst team. There 
were 65 Fund Analyst Picks as of mid-2008.
Another helpful tool is the Morningstar fund indices. At first glance, these 
look like category averages, but in fact they’re much more useful than that. 
Morningstar calculates weighted average rates of return for each of the 42 
categories. A weighted average is far more useful than the simple average 
you see quoted most everywhere else because it assigns more importance to 
the larger funds within a category, and less to the smaller ones. The degree 
of a fund’s contribution to the index return is determined by the size of its 
total assets. Better still, each Morningstar Fund Index is corrected for survi-
vorship bias, which means the values include the impact of returns of funds 
that no longer are active funds (such as those that were closed down and/or 
combined with other funds). These indices also weed out funds that report 
returns before fees. Simply put, the Morningstar fund indices provide the 
most accurate snapshot of how funds in a certain category have fared over 
the years.
Morningstar.ca’s reports set it apart from the rest of the Internet pack. 
Morningstar is the only independent Web site operator in Canada to provide 
analysts’ reports on individual funds. These reports are prepared according 
to a rigorous research framework, which ensures each fund is fairly mea-
sured against its peers. After the research has been completed, the analysts 
don’t hold any punches, telling a particular fund’s story in sometimes brutal 
clarity. You won’t find reports on all the funds you’re interested in, but the 
choice is pretty impressive — the firm’s team of analysts covers several hun-
dred funds. The reports are timely, too; reports remain posted for a year or 
so, and are removed if they’re not updated by that time.
Morningstar.ca has other unique article content, including profiles of hundreds 
of portfolio managers and the must-read weekly Fund Watch column that covers 
virtually every news development of note in the investment funds industry.
The site is free, although an even more detailed version is available to invest-
ment advisers at MorningstarAdvisor.ca. A premium version of Morningstar.ca 
is in the works, so keep an eye out for it. It will charge a fee, but if you have a 
thirst for endless data, you may find it’s worth the money.

Checking out other sites worth a visit
Between Globefund and Morningstar, you’re set for independent mutual fund 
information. But, we know some people are information junkies — if you’re 
one of those people, we recommend bookmarking these sites.
Canadian Business Online
The mutual funds section of this wide-ranging Web site (www.canadian
business.com) — the online portal for Rogers Communications Inc.’s 
various financial publications, including Canadian Business and MoneySense 
magazines — contains a lot of interesting reading and analysis. It’s fairly 
buried, so you’ll have to access it via the “Your Money” tab at the top of the 
home page. (Alternatively, simply type “Moneysense.ca” into your browser 
and save a step or two.) When you find the mutual funds section, you can 
access an extensive fund selector tool that brings up numeric information 
along with articles related to fund investing.
What ever happened to paper?
Until a few years ago, a great way to get started 
in mutual fund investing was to go to your local 
mega-bookstore, head for the business section, 
browse for an hour or so, and pick a couple of 
volumes with the right content and tone to buy. 
A month or so (and a few colour highlighter 
pens) later, you’d be knowledgeable enough 
about fund investing to call a broker or financial 
planner — or, if you were really on top of the 
topic, a discount broker or other direct seller.
Although we still recommend including a book-
seller in your fund-research pilgrimage — 
after all, you’re reading this book — book-
store shelves have almost nothing left for the 
Canadian fund investor. Sure, the business sec-
tion is as vast as ever, but most of those books 
are about the stock market, portfolio manage-
ment, financial planning, or other money-related 
topics. You’ll come across plenty of mutual fund 
books, too, but almost all of these are of real 
use only to American investors. They’ll contain 
interesting stuff on portfolio diversification and 
the benefits of long-term investing, but these 
books constantly refer to U.S. fund products 
you can’t buy unless you’re a U.S. resident.
The news media remain a useful source of 
mutual fund information, with the Globe and 
Mail, the Financial Post, and other large news-
papers frequently publishing stories on the risks 
(and sometimes the benefits) of fund invest-
ing. But the papers no longer include monthly 
fund performance reports in their print edi-
tions, referring readers to their Internet sites. 
Magazines like MoneySense and Canadian 
Business have excellent reading on the subject 
too, but they have a lot of other ground to cover 
in their monthly and special issues.
Worth looking out for, though, is MoneySense’s 
Honour Roll: Canada’s Best Mutual Funds, an 
annual report that produces a list of 100 funds 
its contributors deem to be worthwhile. Much of 
the report is also available online, as we report 
in the section “Independent Sources: Where to 
Get the Honest Goods.”

Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
Most notable on the site is MoneySense’s annual Honour Roll of the best 
mutual funds. This is an exhaustive analytical project, undertaken for 
MoneySense by independent analyst Suzane Abboud of FundScope Ltd. The 
Honour Roll includes funds that have performed consistently well over the 
long term, without experiencing big swings during up and down markets, 
in six asset areas: Canadian equity, U.S. equity, Canadian balanced, global 
equity, small-cap equity, and Canadian bonds.
Fundlibrary.com
Fund Library, one of the first mutual fund Web sites in Canada, offers a wide 
range of services. It has a set of powerful fund comparison tools, using data 
supplied by Fundata, which also supplies Globefund and Morningstar with 
their information. The site offers more fund-list display options for free than 
what’s available on Morningstar or Globefund. These include an unusual tool 
that lets you see which funds are invested in any of 95 countries. For instance, 
did you know that, as of mid-2008, 417 funds had a least some money invested 
in Egypt? Unfortunately, we were unable to find any means of sorting funds by 
other forms of asset allocation. Looking up individual fund companies or port-
folio management teams is easy, but these aren’t necessarily the same firm as 
the fund sponsor.
Fund Library has plenty of original editorial content, including regular col-
umns by its editor, Levi Folk. You can also find manager interviews, “Value 
Picks” reports on individual funds, and even some sponsored personal 
finance content here. The site also features a lively discussion forum.
Lipper Leaders
Lipper Inc., one of Morningstar’s biggest competitors in the United States, set 
up shop in Canada recently at www.lipperleaders.com. Like Fundata, its 
business is selling data, and it doesn’t offer a Web site laden with fund-lookup 
tools. The site does, however, rank funds according to its Lipper Leaders 
fund rating system, which, similar to the Morningstar and Globe systems, 
assigns “Leader” ratings to funds measured against peer groups. Lipper 
Leader ratings are calculated for five different metrics or analysis areas: total 
return, consistent return, preservation, expense, and tax efficiency.
Unlike their competitors’ ratings, Lipper Leaders are assigned using an even 
20-percent peer-group division. For example, the top 20 percent of funds 
(ranked by specific criteria) in a category receive a rating of 1.
Other independent sites worth a look
Still hungry for more? A number of other Canadian Web sites offer interesting 
mutual fund content, including the following:

307
 Chapter 21: The Internet: The Place to Go for Fund Information
 
 CanadianFundWatch.com: This sometimes quirky Web site is run 
by investor advocate Ken Kivenko and consists almost entirely of his 
commentaries, which tend to lash out at the fund industry’s favourite 
whipping topics such as high management expense ratios (MERs) and 
closet indexing (where supposedly active funds actually shadow their 
benchmark index). The site also features explanatory pieces on such 
analytical measures as the Sharpe Ratio, a widely used assessment of 
a fund’s return relative to a risk-free cash investment (a government 
Treasury bill).
 
 Bylo Selhi: Before you scratch your head over the name behind this Web 
site (www.bylo.org), just say it slowly: “Buy low, sell high.” Bylo Selhi 
is the pen name of a financial adviser. Under this pseudonym, he’s a well-
known contributor to discussion forums and an advocate of do-it-yourself 
investing. The site contains commentaries, how-to articles, and lists of 
funds that are deemed by Mr. — or is it Ms.? — Selhi to provide good value 
thanks to low MERs. Other sections provide links to numerous articles, 
published in Canada and elsewhere, related to Selhi’s investment themes.
The Regulatory Jungle: When You 
Need Official Stuff
Sometimes going to the government or an official industry organization for 
information is unavoidable. At least in this case you don’t have to take a 
number and line up.
The Investment Funds Institute of Canada
The Web site of the Investment Funds Institute of Canada (IFIC), the trade 
group that represents mutual fund companies (www.ific.ca), is a great 
place for data junkies who want to know how much money is invested in a 
particular fund category, or which fund companies are the biggest (or the 
smallest, or the fastest-growing). The site has a useful Investor Resource 
Centre, which contains articles on mutual fund taxation, RRSPs, and other 
topics. You can also check out a detailed member directory, where you can 
find contact information and Web site addresses.
 
Not every fund company is an IFIC member. Excluded are insurance compa-
nies (which operate segregated funds and are members of the Canadian Life 
and Health Insurance Association), as well as a few mutual fund companies, 
big and small, which for one reason or another have chosen not to be mem-
bers. (By “big,” we mean really big — like CI Funds.)

308
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
Investor Education Fund
 
Some good (Ontario) government money went into building the Investor Edu–
cation Fund’s Web site (www.investored.ca), which has a lengthy section on 
mutual funds. (Actually, some of the funding came from fines and other payments 
from wrongdoings in the securities industry!) The Ontario Securities Commission 
established the Investor Education Fund to broaden investor education.
Of particular interest is the Mutual Fund Fee Impact Calculator, accessed 
from the site’s home page. This tool works out how big a bite sales loads and 
MERs will take out of an individual fund investment. Usually these costs are 
expressed only as percentages; this calculator shows the actual dollars gob-
bled up by the various fees charged on a typical fund investment over time.
Mutual Fund Dealers Association 
of Canada
This Web site (www.mfda.ca) of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association of 
Canada might be of use — but unlikely of interest. The MFDA is a subset 
of the Investment Dealers Association that regulates brokerage and finan-
cial planning firms licensed to sell mutual funds, as opposed to investment 
securities in general. You’ll want to go here only if you need information on 
an MFDA-member firm or about the MFDA Investor Protection Corporation, 
which is a sort of insurance policy that protects you, the investor, should 
your broker or planner go broke (don’t laugh — it happens).
The System for Electronic Document 
Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR)
SEDAR has nothing to do with trees or any related earthy analogies about 
branching out and growing your investments. In fact, it’s the address of a 
Web site (www.sedar.com) that is about as dull and lifeless as they come. 
However, its content is extremely important, if not exciting. SEDAR is run by 
the Canadian Securities Administrators (which represents provincial securi-
ties commissions) and contains every public document, report, and filing a 
fund manager (or any publicly traded company) produces.
SEDAR is a little cumbersome to use at first, but after you get the hang of it you 
can find most anything that’s ever been filed with a securities commission in 
Canada. That includes prospectuses, financial statements, annual information 
forms, and those valuable new documents, management reports of fund per-
formance. You can search by date range, company name, or type of document. 
When you unearth what you need, you can download it as a PDF file.

 Chapter 21: The Internet: The Place to Go for Fund Information
Fund Company Sites: Useful Information, 
But Mind the Context
If you love glossy brochures and pamphlets and keep them around for easy 
reference “just in case,” or laboriously file them away in careful order, then 
you’ll love fund company Web sites. On the other hand, if you’re the type 
who tosses marketing glossies in the wastebasket as soon as they arrive, 
you’ll also appreciate the Internet for its inherent lack of paper burden.
Most fund companies have invested mightily in their Web sites. Yes, they 
still produce masses of paper promotion as well, but the Internet increas-
ingly is becoming their main marketing tool. They’re also fast becoming an 
alternative to paper statements, with investors and advisers alike now able to 
access account information online.
An efficient way to find a company’s Web site is to simply type its name into 
an Internet search engine. You also can use the Investment Funds Institute of 
Canada’s directory of mutual fund company sites at www.ific.ca.
On a typical big-company Web site, you’ll find:
 
 Forms: Many company Web sites offer downloadable forms for new 
account applications, account transfers, pre-authorized chequing (PAC) 
schemes, and systematic withdrawal plans (SWP). Too bad you might 
still need the help of a fund company official or your adviser to figure 
out how to complete them!
 
 Marketing-oriented material: In addition to the expected promotional 
material, many companies offer detailed profiles on individual funds and 
portfolio managers. Of even greater use are records (both recent and 
longer term) of daily fund prices, distributions, and performance.
 
 Information above and beyond the call: Some companies, for example 
AGF, go to the unusual extent of revealing information that’s normally left 
buried in various legal documents. Kudos to AGF for providing a table on 
the history of the firm’s fund mergers, closings, and acquisitions, making 
it easy for investors to understand the genesis of the company’s funds.
 
 Personal finance information: Many firms’ Web sites offer articles on 
financial planning topics such as basic investing principles, RRSPs, edu-
cation savings plans, and taxation. You’ll also come across calculators 
(to compute RRSP contributions, say, or the power of compound inter-
est) and other financial-planning tools.
 
 Sometimes the personal finance information that fund companies pro-
vide is objective, but occasionally the content is skewed toward their 
products and marketing approach.

310
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
 
 Regulatory documents: As we explain in Chapter 3, the twice-a-year 
management reports of fund performance (MRFPs) are very useful 
pieces of information. You’ll find them more easily on a company site 
than on SEDAR, the government site we look at in the previous sec-
tion. You’ll still have to dig around a little to find the MRFPs, though. 
Don’t expect a big red button labeled “MRFP” at the top of the home 
page. Too bad everyone can’t present these via straightforward links, 
such as BMO’s “Prospectuses, Reports & Other Information” link or the 
Bank of Nova Scotia’s “Downloadable Documents” link. In most cases, 
you’ll have to sleuth through smokescreens like Mackenzie’s “Marketing 
Material Library” or Dynamic’s “Financial Planning Centre” to locate 
MRFP downloads.
Brokers and Planners: Only the Basics
You’ll find only very basic information on mutual fund investing at most 
full-service investment dealers’ Web sites. One exception is RBC Dominion 
Securities, which offers a useful overview on its site (rbcds.com). But dis-
count brokerages, which want you to operate on your own and simply buy 
and sell products through them (see Chapter 6), offer a wealth of fund infor-
mation. The following discount brokerages offer Morningstar research tools 
on their Web sites (in some cases only to their registered clients):
 
 BMO InvestorLine (bmoinvestorline.com)
 
 RBC Direct Investing (rbcdirectinvesting.com)
 
 TD Waterhouse (tdwaterhouse.ca)
CIBC Investor’s Edge (investorsedge.cibc.com) has a fund research 
package powered by GlobeInvestorGold.
Investing without the Net?
Using the Internet doesn’t guarantee you’ll 
make money from your portfolio — the same old 
rules of buying quality funds with low expenses 
and conservative holdings still apply. So don’t 
worry if you’re not using the Net to invest. You 
can build an excellent portfolio of funds without 
ever firing up a browser. In fact, as some hap-
less investors have found, the Web has given 
birth to a whole new generation of scam artists. 
And it’s certainly created a tidal wave of con-
fusing marketing clutter. But the Internet also 
gives you far more control over your portfolio by 
allowing you to check your portfolio whenever 
you want and, if you do business with a discount 
broker, to buy and sell funds at any time.

RRSPs: Fertilizer for Your 
Mutual Funds
In This Chapter
 Getting to know registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs)
 Figuring out where to buy an RRSP
 Falling in love with self-directed RRSPs
 Deciding which funds should go in your RRSP
C
offee and cigarettes, Saturday night and fighting, tight leather and fun — 
some things just go together. And mutual funds are a powerful combination 
with Canada’s beloved registered retirement savings plan (RRSP), a tax-deferred 
account in which your investments pile up without molestation from the govern-
ment. In this chapter, we explain why it’s a great idea to fill up your RRSP as a 
first step when buying funds, and we also look at the sort of funds you should 
put into your plan. The chapter also offers a brief rundown of the rules of RRSPs. 
They can be horrendously complex, but in essence they’re simple — just stick 
your money in, buy top-quality funds, and watch your nest egg grow and grow.
Pour It In and Watch It Grow: 
Understanding RRSPs
An RRSP is like a warehouse for investments and assets in which they can 
accumulate tax-free until you take the money out and spend it. At that stage, 
you have to treat the withdrawals as income, and pay taxes on them. But 
the idea is that you won’t care about having to share some of the loot with 
Ottawa at that stage because the money will have grown tax-free to such a 
huge pile and also because you’ll be in a nice low tax bracket (because your 
income will be lower in retirement).

312
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
So an RRSP isn’t an investment in itself — you don’t “buy” an RRSP — but 
rather a tax-privileged account in which you hold investments and assets. 
Don’t even think about it too much. Just go ahead and open an RRSP account. 
It’s one of the great tax breaks Canadians get, for two reasons:
 
 The money you put in comes off your income for tax purposes: The 
government’s attitude is that money you put into an RRSP is cash you’ve 
diverted from your income for the moment — or deferred, in the jargon — 
so you don’t have to pay tax on it. That’s why taxpayers who’ve contrib-
uted to their RRSPs the previous year get back tax refunds, or returns of 
taxes they already paid.
 
 Your investments accumulate tax-free within the plan: This is the 
real reason why RRSPs are so powerful. The dollars in there are super-
charged because the interest, dividends, and capital gains they attract 
are free of tax. Added to the pile, those earnings go on to earn their own 
cute little baby earnings, which in turn produce their own offspring, and 
so it goes. And tax-free compounding of investment returns is a wonder 
of the modern world.
Claiming a tax refund for the cash you put into a plan is wonderfully simple 
and perhaps the most enjoyable thing about an RRSP (although watching 
your balance climb steadily is also fun). And the refund can be a fair amount 
of money. If your top tax bracket is 40 percent (that is, the government takes 
away 40 percent of the uppermost portion of your income), then a $5,000 
RRSP contribution can earn you a refund of $2,000.
Even the saddest and least organized financial planner in Canada can open 
an RRSP for you and handle your contributions. Ottawa makes it simple. Your 
tax return clearly asks if you’ve contributed to an RRSP and then invites you 
to deduct the amount from your income. And, helpfully, the government 
mails you a slip along with your tax refund or tax bill each spring showing 
exactly how much you can contribute for the current year.
Figuring out how much you 
can put in your RRSP
Actually, it’s a good thing the tax authorities tell you how much room — or 
maximum possible contribution — you have. That’s because for people who 
are in a pension scheme at work, the RRSP contribution limits are complicated 
to calculate. If you’re in a pension plan, you’re already getting tax relief on the 
money you contribute to that scheme, and your employer may also be helping 
out, so policymakers water down the amount you can plow into your RRSP.

313
 Chapter 22: RRSPs: Fertilizer for Your Mind
 
If you’re not in a pension plan, the maximum contribution is up to 18 percent 
of the income you earned the previous year. However, regardless of that figure, 
an annual dollar limit applies, which is $20,000 for the 2008 taxation year, 
$21,000 for 2009, and $22,000 for 2010. Thereafter, it’s supposed to be indexed 
to inflation — that is, the maximum contribution will increase each year in line 
with the general rise in prices. (The “great thereafter” is never actually reached 
because, fortunately for tax-break-starved Canadians, the government tends to 
come back and increase the RRSP limits every few years or so.)
If you’re in a pension scheme, then your maximum contribution is reduced by 
something called the pension adjustment, which is the value the tax authorities 
assign to the value of the pension benefit you build up each year — and it’s then 
used to reduce your maximum RRSP contribution. Your pension adjustment is 
reported to you each year on the T4 tax slip you get from your employer. The T4 
shows the income you earned and the tax paid during the latest year.
 
If your income is roughly $111,000 or more, you’re entitled to contribute the full 
$20,000 for 2008 — as long as you’re not in a pension plan. But if you are, and the 
tax people decide that the value of the pension benefit you build up during the 
year is, say, $5,000, then your maximum contribution is reduced by that amount, 
to $15,000. Still, that’s not too shabby. If you can’t afford to contribute that 
much, you needn’t waste the unused amount. The government lets you “bank” 
the amount you can’t afford to contribute to use in a future year. So if you could 
muster only $10,000 for 2008, you add the unused amount — $5,000 if you were 
in the pension situation described above, otherwise $10,000 — to your contribu-
tion limit in 2009 or a future year. In effect, you can create a balance of unused 
contribution room that can be used as an additional RRSP contribution above 
and beyond your limit in any future year.
 
You have even more RRSP contribution leeway. The tax department will let 
you put in an extra $2,000 each year without being required to withdraw that 
amount and pay a penalty (the taxpayer’s version of a fine).
The deadline for making an RRSP contribution that is tax-deductible for a par-
ticular year is 60 days following the end of the year in question — normally 
March 1. So most people make a 2008 RRSP contribution during 2009. Being 
procrastinators, millions of people leave their RRSP contribution until those 
two months, and that’s why you see a hysterical flood of RRSP advertising 
and hype in January and February.
It all sounds a bit daunting, but don’t worry. You can find out how much you’re 
allowed to contribute to your RRSP for a particular year simply by checking the 
Notice of Tax Assessment the government sends you a month or so after you file 
your income tax return. For example, your 2007 assessment includes a section 
that tells you how much you will be allowed to contribute for 2008 — that is, by 
the March 1, 2009, deadline. So take note of this information before you file away 
that nasty little document.

314
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
Understanding the power of tax deferral
Getting a tax refund for contributing to your RRSP is nice, but the even more 
powerful attraction of RRSPs is the way that income earned within the plan 
is also tax-deferred. It piles up year after year without the Canada Revenue 
Agency sticking its claws in along the way.
Investment income such as interest and dividends, as well as capital gains — 
a fancy name for trading profits — can pile up tax-free inside an RRSP, which 
makes an RRSP the ideal place to put your mutual funds. That’s because, as 
we explain in Chapter 23, funds throw off their income and capital gains to 
unitholders each year in the form of distributions. Distributions are payments 
your fund makes to you. You can take them as a cheque or as more units. 
Most people take the payouts in the form of new units, but it doesn’t matter; 
the distributions are taxable just the same — unless they’re earned in a tax-
deferred plan such as an RRSP.
You can be sure that a bond or other income-oriented fund will generate 
a steady stream of distributions (that’s what they’re designed to do), and 
equity funds have a habit of suddenly producing big capital gains for their 
investors — which can be painful if you don’t hold the fund in a tax-deferred 
account.
Given long enough, money that compounds tax-free grows at a frightening 
pace. But it’s a good sort of scary, if you know what we mean. For example, 
as shown in Figure 22-1:
 
 Let’s say you invested $6,000 each year in an ordinary account that earned 
5 percent annually, but you also had to pay 40 percent of the return each 
year in tax. The money would grow to about $231,000 in 25 years.
 
 If you invested that $6,000 in an RRSP at the same rate of return, where it 
built up tax-free, then you’d have nearly $307,000 after 25 years.
So, when you take the money out of that whopping quarter-million-dollar 
RRSP, you’ll want to avoid having to pay tax on every penny of it. The idea, of 
course, is that by that stage you will have quit working, so you’re in a low tax 
bracket. But always remember that while the magic of tax-free compounding 
within an RRSP does produce wonderful growth, the dollars inside the plan 
have annoying little strings attached.
Where to Buy Your RRSP
Buying an RRSP is simple because banks, brokers, and fund companies just 
love them. The money tends to be long-term retirement savings that won’t be 
withdrawn for years, so it sits there producing a stream of fees for the lucky 
firm that gets to hold it. And it’s a massive industry: Statistics Canada reports 

315
 Chapter 22: RRSPs: Fertilizer for Your Mind
Canadians have more than a half-trillion dollars sitting in RRSPs. Six in ten fami-
lies had an RRSP account, with a median value of about $25,000. The median 
contribution in 2006 was $2,730. Contributions in 2006 topped $34 billion, up 6 
percent from 2005. However, that represented only 7 percent of the total RRSP 
contribution room available to Canadians — which means a staggering $450 
billion or so of unused contributions is out there because wage slaves can’t or 
won’t find the dough.
You have three basic choices when setting up an RRSP. Here’s the triple play:
 
 Basic banking: You can stumble into a bank, trust company, or credit 
union and ask for a basic RRSP account that holds that particular institu-
tion’s mutual funds and other offerings, usually guaranteed investment 
certificates (refer to Chapter 5).
 
 Limited choice of investments is the problem with doing this, but the sim-
plicity and convenience make it ideal for investors who are just starting 
out. So if you’re looking for convenience, fire ahead and open up a simple 
plan at a bank. As you learn more and your assets grow, it’s pretty simple 
to move the holdings later into another RRSP at a full-service broker or 
discount broker plan for a fee of about $100 (the delighted institution 
that’s getting your money will often pay the fee for you).
 
 Banks offer a wide selection of index funds that track the entire market 
at low cost to the unitholders; an RRSP full of index funds with a smaller 
portion of ordinary actively managed funds is a wise choice for nearly 
any investor. Bank funds are no-load — they sell directly to investors 
and do not charge a sales commission. No-load funds also are sold by a 
handful of independent companies. They, too, will be happy to set up an 
RRSP on their books for you.
 
 From your planner: If you go to a commission-paid financial planner, 
he or she may put your investment into a fund company’s RRSP. That’s 
an RRSP set up on the books of the fund company, which almost always 
holds just that company’s funds. It’s an easy option for the salesperson 
because the fund manager handles all of the administration and registra-
tion of the plan with the government. Once again, though, limited choice 
is a problem from your point of view. But a fund company RRSP is handy 
for investors who don’t want to fiddle around too much with their port-
folios, because the fund company does all the bookkeeping.
 
 Not all planners will limit you to a fund company–sponsored RRSP. 
Some have arrangements with an outside trust company or other ser-
vice provider that let them offer independent RRSPs and normal taxable 
accounts that can hold funds from a variety of fund companies.
 
 Self-directed: The final, best, and increasingly popular way to do it is to 
start up a self-directed RRSP at a discount brokerage company. This is the 
very finest type of RRSP because you’re free to hold virtually anything, 
instead of limiting your portfolio to the wares of just one company. Check 
out the next section for more.

The Beautiful Garden That Is 
the Self-Directed RRSP
Just about everyone should have a self-directed RRSP because, well, these 
things are marvellous. The traditional RRSP offered by a bank or fund manager 
is basically a vehicle for holding just their stuff. But with a self-directed plan, 
you’re free to roam the world. A self-directed RRSP is a plan in which you’re 
free to hold just about anything. It’s about the only way to own stocks or bonds 
within an RRSP and to load up on funds from a multiplicity of companies.
Setting up a self-directed RRSP is easy — remember that brokers welcome this 
type of business, because it tends to represent long-term money that’ll be on 
their books for decades. And the term self-directed often doesn’t apply, because 
many investors have a full-service broker who helps them pick what should go 
into their plan. However, self-directed RRSPs are ideally suited for discount bro-
kerages because discounters tend to have a large selection of funds, available for 
low or no sales commissions. See Chapter 6 for more on discounters.

317
 Chapter 22: RRSPs: Fertilizer for Your Mind
Expect to pay a maximum of $100 for most plans annually. Lots of fund sell-
ers and discount brokers charge less or waive the charge altogether if your 
account is big enough, so be sure and ask them to do so if you’re investing 
$10,000 or more.
 
Don’t worry that opening a self-directed plan means you have to become a 
stock market wizard. Stick to the rules for fund selection in this book (which 
we cover in Chapter 10) and you’ll almost certainly do okay. You don’t have to 
start playing stocks directly: Lots of investors hold nothing but conservative 
mutual funds in their self-directed plans.
And don’t be shy about transferring assets from other plans into your self-
directed plan. The old brokerage firm or bank that’s seeing your money 
depart its coffers will sometimes drag its feet on the paperwork (getting nasty 
shoe marks all over it). But after a few weeks, if a delay drags on that long, 
you can simply threaten politely to call the Investment Dealers Association 
of Canada, the Toronto-based lobby group that regulates the industry. That 
usually speeds things up a bit.
 
If you’re moving assets from an existing plan over to the self-directed RRSP, 
the new brokerage firm may tell you that its systems won’t accommodate 
some or all of your old funds. In that case, you may have to sell the funds in 
the old account and just move the cash proceeds over. That’s a hassle, but it 
shouldn’t cost you anything in taxes because the transaction is taking place 
within an RRSP, shielding any capital gains. (Refer to “Pour It In and Watch It 
Grow: Understanding RRSPs” for more about RRSPs and taxes.)
Planting the Most Fragrant Flower: 
Choosing Funds for Your RRSP
The overriding rule for investments inside your RRSP should be Insist on 
Quality — leave the wacky speculative stuff for the money that’s not ear-
marked to support you in your dotage. That means buying conservative 
equity and bond funds, and going easy on emerging markets funds, volatile 
single-industry funds, and small-company funds.
The dollars inside your plan should be treated as sacrosanct — all incense 
and white cloth — because they’re irreplaceable. Because you are restricted 
in how much you can contribute to an RRSP over the years, when a magical 
compounding RRSP dollar has been lost on a slump in the Brazilian market, 

318
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
it can’t be restored. Chapter 4 offers two suggested RRSP portfolios, and just 
about any bank or mutual fund now has a proprietary system for suggesting 
the asset mix in your plan. (Beware of fund packages, however, which we 
discuss in Chapter 20.)
 
With this type of long-term investing, the costs and fees charged by the funds 
and fund mixtures assume ever-greater importance. So own at least some 
index funds in your plan. Your RRSP is too important to have it spoiled by 
some Lexus-driving turkey who can’t keep up with the market.
Including international investments
Until recently, investing money in an RRSP was severely handicapped by an 
evil restriction known as the foreign content limit. This meant your RRSP 
could contain a maximum of 30 percent foreign investments. Cloaked in patri-
otic reason, in fact this served as a prop for the Canadian stock market and 
put severe restrictions on how Canadians could use one of the few tax breaks 
available. But the government washed the foreign content rules away in one 
fell swoop in its 2006 budget, opening the door completely to investing in for-
eign stocks and other worldwide markets.
 
Of course, the non-geographic restrictions remain in place: An eligible stock 
must be listed on an exchange approved by the Canada Revenue Agency, and 
bonds must be issued by a government or related agency, or if it is a corpo-
rate issue it must be rated as “investment quality.” (See Chapter 14 for more 
on bonds.) And so on.
The deep-sixing of the foreign content limit also freed fund investors from 
having to fathom a complex fund version that emerged in the late 1990s to 
serve as an end run around the rules. Fund companies came up with flocks 
of “clone” products that were foreign but used financial witchcraft to count 
as Canadian, through the use of futures contracts on existing foreign funds. It 
was an unspeakably complicated arrangement that few investors understood. 
Mercifully, the clones quickly disappeared after the rule change, with units of 
these funds being rolled over to the underlying funds.
Mixing the right assets
As with other forms of investing, your asset mix is almost certain to get more 
cautious as you get older and closer to taking money out of your plan rather 
than putting it in. For nearly everyone, that means more bonds and cash and 
fewer stocks.

 Chapter 22: RRSPs: Fertilizer for Your Mind
 
Many experts say you should put your bond funds into your RRSP if you’re a 
long-term investor, and the numbers seem to indicate that they’re right. That’s 
because bond funds earn and throw off a constant stream of interest, which 
attracts murderous rates of tax.
Funds usually pay distributions in the form in which they receive the money 
from their investments. So interest earned by a fund is paid as a distribution 
that’s taxable as interest in the investor’s hands. Capital gains — the polite 
term for trading profits — are paid out as capital gain distributions, and divi-
dends earned by a fund are paid out as dividend distributions to the investor.
Equity funds are mainly about buying and selling stocks so they generate 
capital gains distributions — and only one-half of a capital gain is taxed in the 
hands of the investor. Equity funds also produce dividends from Canadian 
companies — payouts of the company’s profits to shareholders — which are 
also lightly taxed. So, funds that produce distributions in the form of dividends 
or capital gains are reasonably tax-efficient, or lightly taxed, making them more 
suitable than bond funds for an open or taxable account. (Tax efficiency is a 
value computed by fund data firms that captures the percentage of the pre-tax 
return that is retained by a hypothetical investor after accounting for taxes on 
distributions. See Chapter 23 for more on this.)
In other words, equity funds are often better than bond funds when it comes 
to investing outside your RRSP. Have a look at Table 22-1, which compares 
pre- and after-tax returns, as well as tax efficiency (assuming you continue to 
own the fund), for three Bank of Montreal funds. Say you’d invested in BMO 
Equity Index Fund, a big index fund with low portfolio turnover because it 
simply tracks stocks in the S&P/TSX composite index, in mid-1998. If you held 
the fund for ten years in an RRSP, by mid-2008 your compound annual return 
would have been 8.1 percent. But if you’d been paying tax along the way, 
you’d have ended up with a 7.9-percent “tax-adjusted” return. That’s not bad, 
as this fund had a low portfolio turnover rate during those 10 years and this 
was very tax efficient. By contrast, the return for BMO Bond Fund held out-
side an RRSP was only about half as good as the return inside an RRSP.

Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
Now every rule has its exceptions, and quadruply so when it comes to taxes 
and investing. An equity fund that pays big distributions year after year, 
while producing solid returns as well, may be an excellent candidate for your 
RRSP because you’ll be shielding those payouts from tax. You can get an idea 
whether the fund manager is in the habit of paying out lots of capital gains 
by looking at one of the new fund prospectuses or by checking with your 
salesperson.
 
But don’t get all bogged down in theories: Remember to put top-quality stuff 
into your RRSP and you’ll likely do fine, whether it’s bonds or stocks. The 
market has an old saying that you should never let tax strategies blind you to 
the merits or faults of an investment. Nobody’s ever wished she’d had more to 
drink the night before — and nobody’s ever regretted holding a well-managed 
equity fund in an RRSP over many years, no matter how small the distributions.

A
lot of investment writing and theorizing seem to take place in an airy-
fairy world in which everybody is beautifully dressed and articulate, 
no one ever eats with her mouth open, all decisions are perfectly rational, 
and nobody ever has to pay taxes. In fact, the stock and bond markets are 
rather squalid places driven by terror and avarice, in which nondescript 
people swap sleazy favours. And taxes end up grinding us all down remorse-
lessly. Unless mutual fund unitholders are investing through a tax-deferred 
plan, the government often goes after them mercilessly. In this chapter, we 
outline how to count the cost of taxes, and we look at a couple of methods of 
reducing the pain.
The Wacky World of Fund Distributions
Now this stuff will get a little complicated, but bear with us because it’s 
worth knowing and we should be able to cut through it pretty quickly. Mutual 
funds, as you know, hold all kinds of company shares, bonds, and cash — 
and sometimes derivatives, those strange financial deals based on options 
and futures, which are promises to buy or sell something at a certain price.
 
All the time, cash is piling up in the fund from three main sources:
 
 Every year, the stocks pay dividends to the fund — which are payouts to 
the shareholders of a portion of the company’s profit.

322
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
 
 Meanwhile, the bonds and cash, which are loans to government and big 
companies, keep earning interest income.
 
 The fund also earns capital gains — which are essentially trading profits 
generated by buying low and selling high — when it sells stocks, bonds, 
and derivatives.
In general, no fund hangs on to these streams of income and capital gains 
because, if it did, the fund itself would have to pay tax on them, reducing its 
total return. So just about all mutual funds pay out the interest and dividend 
income and capital gains to their unitholders in the form of so-called distribu-
tions, letting them deal with the tax.
The investors have to pay tax on the income and gains at their own personal 
rate. It’s more sensible to have the unitholders, rather than the fund, pay the 
tax because many of the unitholders may not even be taxable personally. Those 
investors can collect the distributions and not owe a penny to Ottawa. And 
investors who hold the fund in a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) — a 
tax-deferred holding tank in which investments can grow tax-free — don’t have 
to pay tax on the distributions immediately, so it would be a waste of money for 
the fund to pay taxes on their behalf. Other unitholders may have low incomes, 
meaning that their tax rates are low or zero.
Paying out distributions to fundholders
 
Here is where things begin to get Druidical — when a fund pays out a distribu-
tion, it reduces the cash value of each of its own units. Let’s say the fund has 
total assets of $100 million and 10 million units outstanding, or in the hands of 
investors. Then each unit has a net asset value per unit — or price — of $10 
($100 million divided by 10 million). Now say the manager pays out $20 million 
in capital gains to the unitholders. That’s $2 for every unit ($20 million divided 
by 10 million units outstanding). If all of them took it in cash, then the value 
of the fund’s assets would drop to $80 million. It still has 10 million units — 
outstanding, though, so the value or price of each falls to $8 ($80 million 
divided by 8 million), after taking away the value of the $2 distribution.
Table 23-1 shows what happens to your cash if you’re a unitholder in the 
fund and you have 100 units.
In other words, you start out owning 100 units, which are worth $10 each, for 
a total holding of $1,000. The fund declares a distribution of $2 a unit, which 
you elect to take in cash. You then still hold 100 units, but the value of each 
has dropped by $2 to $8, which leaves you with $800 worth of units. But you 
also have the $200 in cash ($2 for each of your units), which means you still 
have a total holding of $1,000.

But most people just put the money back into the fund. One of the great 
advantages of mutual funds is the fact that you can automatically reinvest 
your income and capital gains in more units, which go to bolster your 
account and earn even higher streams of income and gains in the future. It’s 
a no-brainer, as we like to say in frontal-lobe surgery. That’s what long-term 
investors do — take their distributions in the form of more units.
So let’s say you follow that course. You don’t get cash but more units. Their 
value has dropped by $2 each, but that’s fine because the investor now owns 
more of them. This scenario is shown in Table 23-2.
Table 23-1

You get an extra 25 units valued at $8 each, which increases your unit total 
to 125. The units are now worth just $8 each, though, so you still have a total 
holding of $1,000. As you can see, a distribution isn’t really a windfall or a 
payout to you. It reduces the value of each unit you hold, so it’s more like a 
reshuffling of your investment in the fund.
Note that if you hold funds in a discount brokerage account, you may have 
an alarming experience when you get your statement for December 31. Your 
fund units may have fallen sharply, reflecting the value of a distribution, but 
there might be no sign of any extra units in your account to make up for it. 
So it sometimes looks as though the value of your investment has slumped. 
That’s actually just an administrative glitch: The lines of communication 

324
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
aren’t always very good between discount brokers and the fund companies 
at the end of the year, when the fund industry is scrambling to calculate the 
distributions. Your broker’s system may not record the distributions until 
mid-January or so, after you’ve gotten your December statement. However, 
the error should be fixed by the time you get your statement for January 31.
A fund can easily lose money during a calendar year (because its unit price 
dropped) but also pay out distributions to unitholders because the fund 
manager earned interest or dividend income or made some capital gains 
by selling a stock or bond. Taxable unitholders find themselves in the gall-
ing position of having to pay taxes on their investment in a fund, even 
though it lost them money. Gee, thanks. For example, Brandes Canadian 
Equity, a small-cap fund, was 2007’s worst performing Canadian equity fund. 
Nevertheless, it still made a distribution of 72 cents a unit in December. And 
Trimark Canadian Endeavour — with a 14.7 percent loss in 2007 the third 
worst overall among domestic equity funds — paid out near a dollar per unit.
Watching out for tax exposure
Many equity and balanced funds pay out their capital gains distributions in 
December, and bond funds and other income funds usually pay out interest 
income quarterly or even monthly. Funds that seek bond interest, dividends, 
and other regular income nearly always pay it straight out to unitholders. So, 
bond, dividend, and other income funds by their nature pay a lot of distribu-
tions every year, exposing taxable investors to lots of tax on the income. So 
hold them inside a tax-sheltered plan when you can, unless you need the 
regular payments.
By contrast, equity funds can go years without paying any distributions at 
all because the manager hasn’t generated enough trading profits. That can 
be for a number of good reasons, though. The fund may have simply bought 
a bunch of good companies and hung on to them without selling the shares, 
nicely increasing its value per unit. In 2007, one-quarter of domestic equity 
funds did not make a distribution.
 
The taxation of funds is cruelly complicated because a host of factors can 
influence it. But with stock funds, the basic rule is this: The more trading done 
by the fund, the bigger the distributions and the higher your tax bill (again, if 
investing outside an RRSP). However, sometimes the need for distributions 
is eliminated because of the way investors move into or out of the fund. Or a 
fund manager can sometimes sell shares and then buy them back immediately, 
again reducing the tax liability of the fund.

325
 Chapter 23: Taxes: Timing Is Everything
Fund companies often make a song and dance about the fact that a fund 
hasn’t paid much in distributions in recent years — reducing the tax bill for 
unitholders — because its manager tends to hold stocks for long periods. 
Instead of selling shares and earning trading profits that must be paid out 
in big distributions, some managers try to simply hold good stocks for long 
periods, increasing the fund’s unit value. But always be wary: A takeover bid 
or drastic change in a company’s fortunes might force the manager to sell the 
stock, forcing the fund to pay out a big distribution.
 
Fund companies say the lack of annual payouts helps you to defer paying taxes 
until you sell the fund’s units. That may be true, but remember that taxation 
shouldn’t be the first thing you consider when making an investment — the fund 
should be suitable in other ways, too. However, if you’re deciding which fund to 
hold in a taxable account — that is, an account that isn’t an RRSP or some other 
tax-deferred plan — then a fund that doesn’t do much trading is often the best 
choice. If the fund uses a definite buy-and-hold style, the fund company’s litera-
ture will usually say so. And as we explain later, equity index funds — funds that 
simply track the whole stock market — are a great buy-and-hold investment.
 
So if you’re trying to decide which funds you should put into your RRSP, the 
income fund is often the best choice because the distributions can just pile up 
in there tax-free until you take the money out.
Because a big capital gains distribution produces an apparent abrupt fall in a 
fund’s unit price at the end of the year, mutual fund investors sometimes get 
a fright. Every year, fund companies get worried phone calls from investors 
asking why their fund’s units seem to have plunged. However, they needn’t 
worry: Yes, the unit price has fallen, but the investor has received more 
units.
Determining what distributions 
your fund has declared
 
Finding out what distributions your fund has declared is easy. On Globefund.
com, follow these steps:
 
1. Type the fund’s name in the search field and click the Go button.
 
2. Select the class of fund you want and click on its name.
 
3. Scroll down to near the bottom of the page to the Distribution Report, a 
table that shows distribution amounts for each of the past six quarters.

326
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
Finding your fund’s distribution history is similarly easy at Morningstar.ca:
 
1. Type the fund’s name in the Quicktake Reports search field to pull up 
the report for that fund.
 
2. Select the class of the fund your want, and click View Report.
 
3. Click on the Tax Analysis tab at the top of the report page and, on the 
page that appears, scroll down to the Distribution History section, 
which is a table showing total annual distributions for each of the past 
five years plus the current year to date.
Both sites provide breakdowns of the various types of distributions — dividends, 
income, and capital gains — and Morningstar also gives return-of-capital distribu-
tions. You can also go to the fund company’s Web site. Mackenzie Financial, for 
example, provides a handy “Distributions” button atop its home page.
Paying Taxes on Fund Distributions
Here’s the rub. No matter whether the investor takes the distributions in 
the form of cash or reinvests them in more units, they’re taxable just the 
same — as long as the fund is held in an open (that is, taxable) account and 
not a tax-deferred plan such as an RRSP. Always remember that none of this 
stuff applies if you hold your fund in an RRSP, but the distributions are ulti-
mately taxable when you start taking money out of the plan. At that stage, 
any money you withdraw is taxed as income, just as though you earned it at 
your normal job.
Enjoying tax breaks on Canadian content
The fact that RRSP withdrawals are taxed like normal income can be a disad-
vantage because the money gets no special treatment, even if it was originally 
earned as capital gains or dividends from a Canadian company. That’s a pity, 
because normally dividends from Canadian corporations and capital gains are 
eligible for the following special tax breaks:
 
 Canadian dividends received by investors get the “federal dividend tax 
credit,” essentially a reduction of the tax you pay to encourage invest-
ment in Canadian companies and to reflect the fact that corporations 
have already been taxed. That means taxation of dividends is relatively 
low. As of mid-2008, an Ontario investor with $75,000 in taxable income 
faced a tax rate of only 13.8 percent on each extra dollar of dividends 
earned compared with 39.4 percent on interest income, according to 
accounting firm Ernst & Young. In Alberta the rates were 5.6 percent and 
32.0 percent, respectively.

327
 Chapter 23: Taxes: Timing Is Everything
 
 You must include only half of a capital gain in your taxable income. That 
makes it even more attractive to hold equity funds outside your RRSP, 
because their capital gains distributions aren’t heavily taxed in the 
hands of investors. As of 2002, an Ontario taxpayer with $70,000 of tax-
able income had to pay tax of only 19.7 percent on each extra dollar of 
capital gains. Albertans paid capital gains tax at 16.0 percent.
Getting tax slips
Don’t worry: Your fund company will send you tax slips each year showing 
how much in interest income, dividends, and capital gains distributions you 
should report in the appropriate place on your tax form.
 
If you hold the fund in an RRSP or other tax-deferred plan, you don’t get tax 
slips because you don’t pay tax on the distributions.
You may get two types of tax slips:
 
 A T3 if the fund you hold is a mutual fund trust, which most funds are. If 
you hold several funds with one company, you’ll probably get just one 
consolidated T3, but it should have a breakdown on the back showing 
which fund paid you which sort of distribution.
 
 A T5 if your fund is itself a corporation, issuing shares instead of units. 
That’s a less flexible type of structure, and most funds these days are 
trusts.
Paying Taxes When You Sell or Exchange
If you sell or redeem some of your fund units at a higher price than you paid, 
and the fund is held in a taxable account, then you’re liable for capital gains 
tax on the profit you made. The same applies even if you just do an exchange 
or switch — moving money from one fund to another. As far as the tax authori-
ties are concerned, an exchange is the same as selling Fund A and then buying 
Fund B. What you do with the proceeds of the sale is irrelevant — if selling the 
first fund generates a capital gain, then you have to pay taxes on it.
Checking out tax-skirting fund structures
A few companies, such as CI Fund Management Inc., Mackenzie, and AGF 
Management Ltd., have set up funds that are organized in “classes” or ver-
sions that are designed to let you switch from fund to fund without generat-
ing capital gains for tax purposes. Technically, they’re actually units of the 

328
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
same fund, although one is the Canadian equity class, the next is the bond 
class, and so on, each with its own cute baby unit price. You can use this 
fund structure and jump from fund to fund, avoiding taxes on any capital 
gains along the way. After all, a capital gain is produced when a fund has 
gone up — and that’s why you bought it in the first place.
Many fund marketers have jumped on the tax-free switching bandwagon. But 
they’ve gone much further than that, bringing out ever more complicated 
products. Here are just a couple:
 
 Fidelity Investments Canada, Mackenzie, and Franklin Templeton 
Investments started selling classes of existing funds that make a steady 
payout to investors who want to gradually withdraw their money from 
their funds — but a lot of the distribution is in the form of return of capi-
tal or a refund of the investor’s own money. That means no tax is pay-
able right then — but it’s added to the investor’s profit for capital gains 
purposes when the units are sold. In Chapter 13, we talk about the new 
balanced funds designed to distribute income to unitholders that also 
use this technique.
 
 Mackenzie (and no doubt others) sells bond funds that distribute inter-
est that normally would attract a heavy tax rate — nearly 40 percent in 
the Ontario example above. But, by swapping a lot of e-mails with other 
chaps who went to Upper Canada College, they’ve figured out a way 
to turn the interest payments into capital gains for unitholders — and 
those are often taxed at just 16 percent.
 
These new tax-managing structures may turn out to be great deals for investors, 
but they add a level of complexity. Make sure you understand before you buy — 
or at least get an adviser who you’re sure knows which number goes where.
Working through capital gain calculations
So how much tax do you face when you sell units of a mutual fund in a “taxable” 
account that’s not an RRSP or similar tax-deferred plan? Look at the example of 
the investor who holds 100 units of a fund — say she paid $8 a unit. If she sells 
half of those units for $10 each, then her account will look something like this:
Purchase 
100 units at $8 for total investment of $800
And six months later:
Sell 
50 units at $10 for total proceeds of $500
Hold 
50 units at $10 for total holding of $500

329
 Chapter 23: Taxes: Timing Is Everything
The units sold for $500 cost the investor $400 originally, so she has to report 
a capital gain of $100, only half of which must be included in taxable income 
for the year. The investor also still holds another 50 units.
When the investor was working out the capital gain on the sales, it was 
necessary to establish the cost base or original cost of the units. That was 
simple to do because it represented just half of the initial investment. But 
when you’ve made more than one purchase of the fund, things become more 
complex and you have to work out an adjusted cost base (ACB). Here’s an 
example:
Purchase 
100 units at $8 for an investment of $800
Purchase 
Another 100 units at $10 for investment of $1,000
The investor now holds 200 units, which cost a total of $1,800, so her ACB is 
$1,800, or $9 per unit ($1,800 divided by 200).
Sell 
100 units at $13 for proceeds of $1,300
The 100 units that were sold at $13 have an ACB of $9 each. That means they 
were sold for a profit of $4 each, so the investor has generated a capital gain 
of $400. And she also still holds 100 units, whose ACB base remains at $9 per 
unit.
 
If you get distributions and reinvest them in more units, then that represents 
yet another purchase of the fund — so you add the value of the distribution 
to your cost base. And always make sure that you do increase the ACB by the 
value of reinvested distributions, because if you don’t you could face double 
taxation.
One more complication: Say the investor incurs a “back-end” commission 
when she sells the fund — that’s a sales charge levied on the proceeds of the 
sale or redemption of the fund.
Sell 
50 units at $13 for proceeds of $650, incurring a 5-percent 
 
redemption charge
The investor’s proceeds from the sale have been reduced by 5 percent, to 
$617.50. That means, for tax purposes, she’s received only $12.35 per unit.
 
Unfortunately, fund companies say they don’t have the systems or information 
necessary to provide you with an accurate ACB for your units for tax purposes. 
That means the unit cost shown on your account statement may not be an accu-
rate guide, so keep full records of any reinvested distributions or purchases or 
sales. Things can get horrendously complex if you have a regular purchase plan, 
which involves buying units at different prices at different times, or if you’ve 

330
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
done a lot of switching around. But the basic principle remains: The cost of your 
units is any money you spent to buy them, plus the value of reinvested distribu-
tions. And selling some of your units doesn’t affect the ACB per unit of the ones 
that remain.
 
Several fund companies offer excellent general information on mutual fund 
taxation. For example, you can download the Mackenzie Mutual Fund Tax 
Guide from Mackenzie Financial’s Web site (go to the Planning Tools section 
of www.mackenziefinancial.com). AIC Ltd.’s Web site (www.aic.com) 
has useful information on taxation in its Tax Smart section.
Avoiding fund purchases near year-end
If you’re tempted to celebrate the holidays by throwing a few thousand into 
an equity mutual fund in a taxable account, it might be a good idea to hold 
off until you’re struggling through your blinding hangover in early January. 
That’s because many funds pay out big capital gains distributions at the end 
of the year. Even if you buy the fund just before the distribution, you’re on 
the hook for capital gains tax on that distribution. Here’s an exaggerated 
example:
Purchase 100 units at $8 for total investment of $800 on December 10.
Receive distribution: If the fund pays out $2 a unit a few days later, its 
unit price will drop to about $6. If you reinvest the distribution, you’ll end 
up with 133 units. But you’ll also have incurred $200 in taxable capital 
gains.
In a sense, you’re simply paying the tax early because the reinvested distri-
bution is added on to your ACB, which reduces your eventual capital gain 
when you sell. But most people would rather defer paying tax, thank you very 
much, so it would have been better to wait until after the distribution was 
made and then buy the fund. That way, your $800 would have gotten you the 
same 133 units, but you wouldn’t have faced that annoying capital gains bill.
Index Funds and ETFs: A Tax-Efficient 
Investment
One type of fund that’s virtually guaranteed to produce very little in the way 
of distributions is the equity index fund (bond index funds throw off piles 
of income, just like regular bond funds). Index funds — and their lower-cost 

331
 Chapter 23: Taxes: Timing Is Everything
cousins, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — don’t try to buy and sell stocks in 
pursuit of capital gains; they just hold every stock in the index. (See Chapter 
15 for more on index funds and ETFs.) So their stream of capital gains dis-
tributions is usually small or non-existent. Yes, they may flow through some 
of the dividend income they receive and they may have to declare capital 
distributions if a major company in the index is taken over or dropped from 
the benchmark, forcing the index fund to sell it and book a gain. But just like 
buying good stocks and holding them for years, putting index funds in your 
non-RRSP portfolio is a highly tax-efficient strategy.
 
Taxes are a blind spot for the fund industry. Most investors probably find it 
virtually impossible to calculate the ACB of the units accurately. And the per-
formance published for funds invariably shows only the returns earned by a 
non-taxable investor. Both problems may be insoluble because everybody’s 
tax situation is different; however, once again, buying an index fund solves a 
lot of your problems. The other solution is to find the adviser from heaven: 
one who goes to the trouble of calculating ACBs for you.
A Few More Ideas for Tax Savings
For the average Canadian, the RRSP is the Rolls-Royce of tax planning. Not 
only does money grow tax-free within the plan, but you also get to write off 
each year’s contributions against your taxable income. The write-off is known 
as a deduction. (We look at RRSPs in greater detail in Chapter 22.)
You can shield your investments, including mutual funds, from taxes through 
a few other simple methods. Two of the most popular are used to build capi-
tal for a child — often to go to college or university — so they’re useful for 
parents and grandparents. The last option we discuss is brand new, so you 
can be the first on your block to try it!
Informal trusts or in-trust accounts
Informal trusts or in-trust accounts are investment accounts set up for the ben-
efit of a child or beneficiary. The person who supplies the money is called the 
donor. Income earned by the account, such as dividends, is still taxable in the 
donor’s hands. But capital gains can be taxable in the child’s hands, and the 
child presumably has such a low income that he or she pays hardly any tax.
The fact that capital gains are taxable in the child’s hands makes in-trust 
accounts ideal homes for equity mutual funds, because they usually produce 
capital gains distributions rather than interest income or lots of dividends. 

332
Part IV: The Nuts and Bolts of Keeping Your Portfolio Going 
(See “The Wacky World of Fund Distributions” in this chapter for more infor-
mation.) Contributing money to the account doesn’t give you a tax deduction. 
When the child reaches 18 or 19 (depending on the province), he or she is 
free to do anything with the money.
 
Brokers and mutual fund companies have offered informal trusts for years. 
When setting them up, be careful to make sure the “trustee” — the person 
overseeing the account on behalf of the beneficiary — is not the same as the 
donor. Otherwise, the tax people may refuse to have the capital gains taxable 
in the child’s hands. And don’t forget that money put into the in-trust account 
belongs to the child forever: You can’t get it back. That means the kid might 
just choose to squander it at 18 or 19. By law, you can’t do anything about it.
Registered education savings plans
Registered education savings plans (RESPs) are more formal government-
registered schemes (with, you guessed it, ridiculously complicated rules) 
in which investment income and capital gains add up tax-free. As with infor-
mal trusts, no deduction applies for contributions. While no annual limit on 
contributions exists, you can contribute only up to $50,000 per child in a 
lifetime. Contributions may be made for up to 31 years from the date the plan 
was first set up, and the deadline for terminating a plan is 35 years from the 
set-up date.
The federal government offers a major plus for RESP investors in the form of 
its Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG), which Ottawa adds to the RESP. 
The grant is 20 percent of the first $2,500 contributed per child annually, so 
it’s a maximum of $500 per year. The maximum grant for each kid is $7,200. 
Some provinces provide additional grants.
 
Note that the rules for RESPs have been changed a number of times, so keep 
an eye on federal and provincial budgets and other government announce-
ments for any future amendments.
Three basic types of RESP exist:
 
 A so-called scholarship trust where your money is pooled with that of 
other parents by a money manager. The fees, complicated rules, and 
super-conservative investments (mostly bonds) of these trusts mean 
that we would avoid them.
 
 RESP accounts offered by mutual fund companies, aimed at getting you 
to buy their funds. They’re fine, but the investment selection is limited.
 
 Self-directed RESPs offered at brokers and discount brokers, which can 
buy stocks, bonds, and cash. Because of flexibility we would go with the 
self-directed option, but investors who want simplicity often stick to a 
fund company RESP.

333
 Chapter 23: Taxes: Timing Is Everything
 
With an RESP, if the child doesn’t go to university or college you can get back 
your contributions but you must refund any CESG grants. You then pay tax on 
any accumulated investment income, but you can move $50,000 of it into your 
RRSP if you still have the contribution room. Contribution room is the limited 
amount you can put into an RRSP each year, and any quota you don’t use can 
be made up in a subsequent year. For much more on RRSPs, see Chapter 22.
A new acronym for the masses: The TFSA
In 2008, the federal government wheeled out a new tax-saving vehicle, the 
tax-free savings account (TFSA). Its title pretty much explains how it works: 
Starting in 2009, you can invest up to $5,000 a year into a TFSA account 
and it’s allowed to grow tax-free for as long as you like. This amount will be 
adjusted each year based on the inflation rate, rounded up or down to the 
nearest $500. The same investments that are eligible for an RRSP are eligible 
for a TFSA (refer to Chapter 22 for more).
Before you get all excited about the RRSP’s sexy sibling coming to town, take 
a deep breath and understand an important difference: You won’t get a tax 
deduction for your contribution. Its appeal grows, however, after you real-
ize that not only will your money be allowed to grow sheltered from tax, you 
won’t have to pay tax when you withdraw it from the account. Of course, 
without a tax deduction going in you’re investing after-tax money in it, so it 
would be double taxation if you did have to pay tax on the way out.
How much the TFSA benefits we tax-weary Canadians remains to be seen — 
$5,000 a year doesn’t seem like much, particularly when stacked up to the 
annual RRSP limit, which is nearing the $20,000 mark.

Chapter 24
Ten Questions to Ask a Potential 
Financial Adviser
L
ots of us are uncomfortable with being assertive with salespeople. 
Hey, we’re polite Canadians, after all. But you need to get some things 
straight before you hand over a penny to an investment adviser. Ask these 
ten questions and jot down notes to look over later. If the answers you 
receive are hazy, think seriously about looking for somebody else.
How Do You Get Paid?
This is the first thing to find out from an adviser, because it usually dictates 
where you’ll hold your account and what kind of investment he or she will 
suggest. If the adviser is paid by the hour (not common in Canada), then his 
or her advice should be reasonably impartial and you will have at least an 
idea of how much you’ll be paying. But if the adviser makes a living by earn-
ing sales commissions then getting you to buy a product is his or her bottom 
line. A commission-paid planner or broker will try to get you to move your 
money over to his or her firm or to a mutual fund company account on which 
the firm earns commissions — that’s known as asset capture.
Some commission-paid advisers won’t want to discuss the subject of how 
they get paid. They’re not being dishonest; skilled brokers often avoid 
depressing topics (such as commissions) and confusing statistics (such as 
rates of return) until they believe they have won your trust. They will first 
sell you on the concept of the fund — investing in big, stable, undervalued 
companies, for example — and then get down to the mechanics of how to 
buy it. But don’t fall for the line. If you don’t get a straight answer on commis-
sions, then go elsewhere.

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
What Do You Think of My 
Financial Situation?
Ask for a quick version of the sort of financial strategy the adviser recom-
mends for you. Listen carefully to the way he or she expresses ideas. Even 
after a brief interview, an experienced adviser should have a reasonable 
notion of your financial health and priorities and should be able to make a 
couple of sensible suggestions. The adviser can’t give you a definitive finan-
cial prescription without knowing your goals, assets, income potential, and 
liabilities. But the sort of questions that he or she asks, and the interest 
shown in your problems, will tell you whether the planner or broker is com-
fortable with you as a client.
Will You Sell Me Index Funds and 
Low-Cost, No-Load Funds?
Funds with low expenses are the very best way to accumulate wealth. 
Unfortunately, too many stockbrokers and planners won’t sell them because 
the bargain-priced funds don’t pay enough in commissions. That’s not neces-
sarily because the salespeople are greedy: They have to make a living. But a 
good planner or broker should be prepared to fix you up with a mixture of 
low-expense, no-load funds and regular load or commission-charging funds. 
Some planning firms and brokers don’t even carry low-cost funds, claiming 
that their administrative systems can’t handle them. In that case, try a firm 
with a full range of products.
What Will You Do for Me?
“Financial planning” means something different to everyone. Get a clear idea 
of what your planner or adviser will do for you and how many times a year 
you can expect to meet. Ideally, there’ll be an organized calendar, so that 
tasks such as making a registered retirement savings plan contribution and 
reviewing your portfolio are dealt with in a predictable way. If you go away 
from the initial meeting with the impression that all this person wants to do 
is sell you a few mutual funds, then that’s probably all you’ll get.

339
 Chapter 24: Ten Questions to Ask a Potential Financial Adviser
Can You Help with Income-Splitting
and Tax Deferral?
Canadians pay a lot of tax, but many opportunities to lessen the burden exist 
through simple tax deferral and income-splitting devices, such as spousal 
RRSPs. An adviser who’s not a tax enthusiast isn’t worth hiring. Tax deferral is 
postponing payment of taxes, usually by diverting income into a tax-sheltered 
account such as an RRSP. Income-splitting usually involves shifting income to 
a spouse or child who’s in a low tax bracket. Make sure the adviser is able to 
set up a RESP and is happy talking about tax-avoidance methods in detail.
 
Avoidance is the legal practice of minimizing the tax you pay, but evasion is 
illegal tax-dodging.
Can I Talk to Some of Your Clients?
The best reference is from someone you know, but asking to talk to satisfied 
customers never hurts. Confidentiality rules will probably prevent an adviser 
from giving out names, but he or she should be able to get someone to call 
you. If the adviser can’t think of a single customer who’d be willing to do that, 
then how much loyalty does he or she inspire?
What Do You Think of the Market?
The ideal answer to this question is: “I don’t know.” You’re hiring someone to 
help manage your savings here, not to accompany you to Las Vegas. Mutual 
funds enable brokers and advisers to do what they’re good at — selling invest-
ments to people — while relieving them of the need to pretend they know how 
to pick stocks. After all, why should they? It’s far more honest for an adviser 
to admit he or she can’t beat the market and then sell you a “managed money” 
product run by someone who is trained to do the job.
Nothing’s wrong with a potential adviser having an opinion on share prices, 
and talking about the market isn’t a crime. But if you get a stream of investing 
theories and stock tips, then you’re talking to a frustrated portfolio manager 
and not someone who’s going to help build your financial future.

340
Part V: The Part of Tens 
What Training Do You Have?
Insist on some kind of specialized training. All mutual fund salespeople have 
to pass a basic funds course to obtain the licence, but that’s fairly bare-
bones. Also check that the planner has obtained a specific financial planning 
qualification. An under-qualified planner or adviser could miss out on some 
tax-deferral or wealth-building techniques he or she hasn’t heard of. But if 
a planner isn’t a member of Advocis or the Institute of Advanced Financial 
Planners, then ask why.
How Long Have You Been Doing This?
Let someone else give a beginner his or her first big break. Financial planning 
and stockbrokerages take in hordes of people every year, chew ’em up, and 
spit lots out. Don’t hire someone who shouldn’t have been in the industry 
in the first place. Go with a veteran with experience. An adviser who’s dealt 
with scores of clients is far more likely to know some neat tricks and ways of 
cutting red tape.
Can I See a Sample Client Statement?
If you’re buying through a financial planner or mutual fund dealer, then expect 
to get a twice-yearly account statement from the mutual fund companies 
you’re dealing with. But the salesperson’s firm should also give you a consoli-
dated account statement showing all your holdings. Check that it’s profession-
ally produced and easy to read. Many aren’t.
If you invest with a traditional stockbroker, then you may just get a statement 
from the brokerage firm, and not the fund company. Ask to see an example of 
a statement.

Chapter 25
Ten Signs You Need to Fire Your 
Financial Adviser
M
aybe they just say this to fool us into thinking they’re human, but 
senior executives often claim that firing someone is the hardest thing 
they have to do. And for an investor, dumping an adviser is also tough. A 
salesperson’s ego and livelihood are tied up in getting and keeping clients, so 
losing your account can feel like a punch in the stomach.
The circumstances are rarely cut-and-dried. Most investment advisers are a 
mixture of good and bad, just like the rest of us. But some clear signs indicate 
that it’s time to move on, and this chapter offers ten classics. These signs 
apply mostly to commission-paid salespeople — because they have the great-
est potential for conflict of interest — but drop a fee-only adviser if he or she 
develops any of these bad habits.
Produces Rotten Returns
We’re amazed at how many clients hang on with a broker or planner through 
years of poor investment performance, often languishing in mutual funds that 
consistently lag the market and rival funds. Yes, measuring performance is 
tricky, especially if you’ve been sold a confusing package of funds that can’t 
be compared with other investments. Your funds should show up fairly con-
sistently in the middle of the pack or higher. One year of poor performance is 
acceptable because good managers often hold stocks that are out of fashion. 
But develop itchy feet if it happens again. Fund managers can be left behind 
by the times, after all. Hot funds may fall to the bottom of the league — but 
bad funds stay that way. If you have an awful year in which most or all of 
your funds are near the back of the pack, then ask for a clear explanation 
from your adviser. If none is forthcoming, consider moving your account.

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Nobody expects a broker or planner to be a genius at picking funds. But all 
too often, poor returns are caused by simple mistakes such as putting too 
much money into funds with the same style, betting too heavily on one asset 
class (stocks or bonds), or chasing risky specialty funds that are too volatile 
for an investor’s core savings.
Pesters You to Buy New Products 
after the Firm Is Taken Over
Be wary if your adviser’s firm changes hands and your salesperson suddenly 
starts pushing a new line of funds, possibly an “in-house” brand or other 
limited-distribution product. These funds may be excellent — and you can be 
sure there’ll be a fancy sales pitch — but the firm’s new owners may be pres-
suring your adviser to switch as many clients as possible to the new lineup. 
You may pay extra costs. In general, stick with widely available mutual funds 
that can be transferred later to a new brokerage or financial planner if you 
decide to change. Alternatively, the new funds may be available everywhere, 
but the firm’s new management may have struck a special distribution deal. 
Remember, if you switch you’ll probably be on the hook for commissions.
Switches Firms Frequently
An adviser who doesn’t stay put is usually someone with whom employers 
aren’t happy — and that’s a sure indication of trouble. The problem may be 
fairly innocent — poor recordkeeping, for instance — or it could be as seri-
ous as putting clients into unsuitable investments. Whatever it is, by the 
adviser’s second or third move you should probably part company.
Financial planners and stockbrokers are independent businesspeople with 
their own book of clients. They join a brokerage firm or mutual fund dealer-
ship because it provides an office, administrative support, and credibility. So 
your adviser will almost certainly try to take you and your account along if a 
move happens. But don’t follow blindly. Talk to the firm’s office manager to 
see if another broker or planner suits you and your investing style.
Be warned, though, that things can get tangled when you pit your adviser 
against her firm. The firm will also want to hang on to your business, so 
the salesperson’s old boss may falsely imply that there was something not 
quite right with the departing employee. In other words, investors often find 
themselves in a tug-of-greed, with both parties battling over “who owns the 

343
 Chapter 25: Ten Signs You Need to Fire Your Financial Adviser
assets” — yes, that’s the industry phrase, even though we’re really talking 
about your money here. We’re afraid you’ll just have to use your judgment. If 
the adviser has provided excellent service, then move your money to his or 
her new firm. Good advisers are hard to find.
Keeps Asking for Power of Attorney 
or Discretionary Authority
Be very wary if an adviser seems excessively keen to get power of attorney or 
discretionary authority over your money — legal terms that denote giving him 
or her the ability to make decisions without consulting you. Even if you find the 
whole investing process overwhelming, giving the job of choosing and selling 
securities to a trusted friend, relative, or even your lawyer is usually preferable.
 
Cases of fraud, exploitation, and deception by brokers almost always involve 
abuse of discretionary authority over clients’ accounts. In fact, it’s question-
able whether you should ever give such sweeping powers to a salesperson.
Doesn’t Listen to You
People in the investment game tend to come out with a spiel, while brushing 
aside or ignoring questions. To some extent, they have been trained to do 
this. Clients often ask questions just for the sake of saying something, the rea-
soning goes, and if the query is genuinely important they’ll raise it again later.
But advisers who just don’t want to hear from you are all too common. 
Andrew has sat in rooms and heard brokers set out a plan for a prospective 
investor after asking only one or two questions. If you feel that your adviser 
isn’t listening to you, then he or she probably isn’t. Time to find someone 
who will.
Doesn’t Return Your Phone Calls
Andrew can’t begin to count the number of phone calls he’s fielded from 
confused investors who can’t even get through to their brokers to obtain 
answers to simple questions. Brokers and planners are salespeople, remem-
ber, which means that they’re fuelled by new conquests. According to some 

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
astute observers, people who go into sales are in fact approval junkies: Every 
time they get a prospect to say yes, it represents validation of them and not 
the product.
Junkies are annoying, though. Brokers and planners often neglect their 
former clients, perhaps because the accounts are too small to generate much 
in the way of commissions and perhaps because the thrill of the chase is 
gone. You deserve better. If you can’t get hold of your adviser easily, then 
look for someone else.
Suggests “Unregistered” Investments 
or Other Strange Stuff
If your adviser recommends some unregistered investments, head for the 
hills. If a fund doesn’t come with a regular simplified prospectus — the legal 
document setting out the dangers and potential of the fund — and isn’t sup-
ported by annual and semi-annual management reports of fund performance, 
then you’re probably going into the deal unprotected. If the investment is 
offered by an insurance company, however, it should be from a company 
you’ve heard of and it should come with a prospectus-like document called 
an information folder.
A few “high net worth” funds for the rich generally require a minimum invest-
ment of up to $150,000. These are sold more like stocks, with the risks and 
terms set out in a document called an offering memorandum. They may be 
good investments, but always check with an accountant or a lawyer. A pro-
fessional’s fee of a few hundred dollars can save you lots of grief.
One of the most common frauds involves offering unlisted stocks, usually 
with the promise that they’ll soon be trading on a proper exchange and that 
the price will shoot up when that happens. Or an unscrupulous broker will 
offer “notes” that purport to carry lavish rates of interest. The scam nearly 
always contains the implication that you’re being let in on the deal in a 
slightly seedy way — “I shouldn’t be telling you this, but. . . .” In fact, an old 
saying exists among fraud artists: “You can’t cheat an honest man.” So if your 
salesperson even hints that buying into a deal involves bending the rules, 
then move your money immediately.

345
 Chapter 25: Ten Signs You Need to Fire Your Financial Adviser
Keeps Wanting You to Buy 
and Sell Investments
Excessive trading — known as churning in the investment industry — is a 
classic sign of a greedy salesperson who views you as a lucrative source of 
commissions rather than as a long-term customer. If your adviser moves your 
money to a new fund company and if you buy the funds on a back-end-load 
basis — incurring a sales commission that applies only if you sell within a set 
number of years — then the salesperson gets up to 5 percent of your invest-
ment. That’s $1,000 if you move $20,000. So always ask why when the adviser 
suggests you sell. You can be less suspicious about moves between funds 
sold by the same company because they don’t usually generate a commission 
for the adviser, although some fund salespeople charge a “switch fee” of 2 
percent. Such transfer fees aren’t justifiable, so refuse to pay them.
Funds are supposed to be long-term holdings — at least five years for an 
equity fund. That’s because the stock market often dips for extended peri-
ods and because a good money manager’s investment style can easily stop 
working for a year or longer. Perhaps your adviser can present a compelling 
reason to sell — a loss of a fund manager or a drastic change in a fund’s hold-
ings, for example. In that case, it may be wise to go along with the suggestion. 
The adviser’s knowledge is what you’re paying for, after all. But remember 
that when you move money to a new fund company or buy a new stock, it’s 
payday for your adviser.
Keeps Making Recordkeeping Mistakes
The investment business is so sales-driven that paperwork and reporting of 
transactions are often far down the priority list. Every investor (including us) 
encounters mistakes and incorrectly executed orders. Check your account 
statement and transaction slips religiously.
The profit margins in the financial planning business aren’t huge, so many 
small firms can’t afford elaborate back offices or administration systems. 
But why should that be your problem? If you find that your adviser or firm is 
constantly getting things wrong, then don’t accept the frustration. Move your 
money to someone who’s more professional. And act quickly if you notice 
that money is missing from your account. Don’t be fobbed off with claims 
that the money is in transit or tied up in red tape. If you can’t get written 
confirmation of the whereabouts of every penny, then talk to the adviser’s 
manager.

346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Won’t Abandon Pet Theories
Some investment advisers are gold fanatics, some are bond nuts (“I don’t 
like to see anything in an RRSP but fixed-income securities”), and some think 
they’re all-knowing about the stock market. If your salesperson keeps repeating 
the same mantra no matter what’s happening to your portfolio, then consider 
a change.
The history of the market is littered with those who hung on for dear life, 
insisting that their particular stocks or ideas “will come back.” Advisers 
and brokers become incredibly attached to these beliefs, even at the cost of 
losing clients. If you think your adviser has a one-track mind, then get off at 
the next station.

Chapter 26
Ten Mistakes Investors Make
W
e’re sure we’ve been guilty of every blunder on this list, so please 
don’t accuse us of lecturing you. Investing is hard because you have 
to conquer not only inflation, endless sneaky expenses, and taxes, but also 
your own innate fear and greed. Here are ten warning signs your personal 
demons are sabotaging your quest for wealth.
Diversifying Too Much
Buying 20 different funds and assuming you can’t lose because you’ve cov-
ered all the bases is pointless. Sure, you’re certain to own something that’s 
going up — but a chaotic portfolio like that is also bound to contain lots of 
funds that hold very similar investments. And the more funds you own, the 
closer your returns will be to the index or market in general — so why not 
just buy index funds and be done with it? Keep things simple by limiting 
yourself to a few index funds (one Canadian, one U.S., and one international) 
plus a few conservative equity funds. That way, you won’t be paying multiple 
management fees to everyone and his beagle in return for mediocre returns 
that track the market, minus expenses.
Diversifying Too Little
Betting the whole lot on one pony can be tempting. But look at what the profes-
sionals do and you’ll notice they always own lots of different stuff. If your port-
folio isn’t a broad mixture of top-quality bonds and conservative stocks, then 
you’re probably going to come off at the first fence. Remember the old rule: Own 
your age in bonds and cash. So, according to the traditional saw, a 40-year-old 
should have just 60 percent of her money in stocks. That seems overly conser-
vative to many people in our go-go age, where retirees can look forward to 25 
years or more after quitting work. But if you don’t own at least some bonds, then 
you’re walking a tightrope — with a noose around your neck.

348
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Procrastinating
Invest $200 a month for 20 years at an 8-percent annual rate of return and 
you’ll end up with more than $113,000. But wait five years before starting, 
and you’re looking at less than $69,000. So get going now. Ten years hence, 
you don’t want to be looking back at today . . . and regretting you didn’t just 
pick up the phone.
Being Apathetic
Allowing your portfolio to slide into mediocrity is so easy — you might ignore 
your awful funds, perhaps, or let the cash component build up too high. 
Personal finances aren’t exactly a blast, so we’re all tempted to leave things 
to the forces of continental drift. But just a few dull hours of work once or 
twice a year can make all the difference between a well-adjusted, balanced 
portfolio and a neglected mess.
Hanging on to Bad Investments
Refusing to sell a bad fund or stock is the true mark of the hopeless amateur — 
Andrew should know, because he’s done it many times. Unfortunately, no green 
light comes on when it’s time to get out. But one thing’s for sure — the price 
you paid is completely irrelevant. Waiting “until it’s back where I bought it” is 
one of the most damaging things you can do to your wealth. Sell it, absorb the 
lesson, and move on.
Taking Cash out of Your RRSP
When contribution room to an RRSP has been used up, it can’t be replaced. 
Just like brain cells. So think long and hard about cashing in any of those 
supercharged dollars nestling within your plan. You not only pay taxes, 
and high ones at that, on the withdrawal, but also give up years of tax-free 
growth. Withdrawing money for a down payment on a house under the Home 
Buyers’ Plan is a little less harmful, because Ottawa lets you put the cash 
back in. But you’re still probably giving up years of tax-sheltered income 
within the RRSP because the money isn’t there to earn it.

349
 Chapter 26: Ten Mistakes Investors Make
Ignoring Expenses
Those extra one or two percentage points in mutual fund fees and costs seem 
so unimportant — but they ultimately represent a huge chunk of your retire-
ment savings. Remember that over 20 years, an extra one percentage point 
in annual expenses eats up one-fifth of the total accumulated capital. Do 
yourself a favour and go with some low-cost managers — look for a maximum 
expense ratio of about 1.5 percent on equity funds.
Failing to Plan for Taxes
Remember that the mutual fund returns that appear in the papers were 
earned in a magical tax-free land of hugs, kisses, and happy pixies. In the real 
world — hellish places like your neighbourhood, for example — people have 
to pay taxes. So beware of holding bonds, bond funds, and other income-
paying investments in a taxable account. To minimize the taxes you pay, opt 
for professional advice, unless your finances are extremely straightforward. 
Tax accountants know perfectly legal tricks that you don’t.
Obsessing about Insignificant Fees
If you’re happy with an adviser or fund company, then don’t get all irate 
about a $75 RRSP administration fee. Just pay it if your returns are good and 
your other expenses are low. People in the fund business will tell you that 
clients happily pay out hundreds or even thousands in management fees 
without even noticing — but they fly into a rage if presented with a $25 bill 
for transferring an account. Remember that the fund company or broker 
who’s truly the cheapest may also be the one who nags you for a “nuisance 
fee” — but at least it’s out in the open. By contrast, a fund that’s dinging you 
for huge expenses each year might seem to be absorbing all of those annoy-
ing charges itself. But don’t worry, you’re paying.
Waiting until the Market Looks Better
Ignore this one if you’re a psychic. But for the rest of us, attempting to divine 
the direction of the market is like trying to catch the wind. The movement of 
share prices is as intangible and random as the weather, or it may as well be.

350
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The fund industry will tell you that “the time to invest is when you have the 
money.” In other words, trying to jump on and off stocks is pointless. And, 
for once, the fund sellers’ homilies are right on the mark. The evidence is 
overwhelming that market timing is a futile exercise, so grit your teeth and 
invest. As they used to say in an annoying Irish lottery ad: “If you’re not in, 
you can’t win.”
