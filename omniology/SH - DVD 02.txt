DVD 2 – The Secrets to Becoming a Master of Instant 
Inductions
Failsafe Instant Inductions
Igor:
Students:
Igor:
All right, let me try that again. Are you guys having fun?
Yes!
Okay, what we’re going to do today is we’re going to focus a little bit on the 
mental dynamics of what you were doing just now, and then we’ll give you 
more practice on those principles in actions. Does that sound fair?
First, what are you trying to achieve with all this convoluted rigmarole and 
so on? In the simplest way – and this is why a lot of people are afraid of 
instant inductions. Here’s what tends to happen.
If we can call this line normal consciousness, down here’s trance, up here is 
regular consciousness. What tends to happen is when we get a shock, 
when we’re alert in some way, the unconscious mind doesn’t know how to 
deal with it so you trance it out for a second to figure out, where do I look to 
find out how to deal with the situation?
The startle reflex won’t kick this is. Anything that startles you will basically,
reset the mind for a split second, which means it started unconsciousness. 
Make sense?
Here’s the problem. Here’s why people are afraid of instant inductions. This 
does not last very long because when a bus is speeding at you, you don’t 
need to be there half an hour to figure out whether or not this thing that’s 
coming towards you is healthy. So this doesn’t last very long. It’s a split 
second, sometimes a couple of seconds depending on the person. 
What then tends to happen is they’ll slowly start to return. Now at this stage, 
most hypnotists go, oh man, I messed up. When if all you do is go, sleep, 
damn it I messed up again, well of course you did because you got them to 
the right point, but you didn’t keep them there. Does that make sense?
So then we have the language like deeper and deeper. We’ll play more with 
actual language later on. What that does is it stabilizes them underneath 
the line. In other words, it keeps them in that slightly trance-like state. Does 
that make sense to everyone?
As a rule, two things you need to bear in mind with instant inductions are–

1. With 90% of the people you’ll meet, just things like doing a little jolt of 
some sort – a gentle one – and then sleep gets them there. Then 
immediately you roll into, that’s right, deeper and deeper, relaxing 
more, that’s it, give me more of your balance, or whatever you want 
to say to stabilize.
2. Sometimes, people are still a little bit scared. You may have 
misjudged them before you actually got to that place. If you’ve 
misjudged it, do you know what you do at that point? Then you go, 
sleep, and they’ll go, what? You just carry it right on. 
You say, that’s right, sleep. And again, sleep. And again, sleep. Do 
you want a quick demo of what I mean by that?
Yes.
Could I have a resistance subject please? A resistance, someone who can 
resist. I know I’m charming. There you go. Come on up. Give him a round of 
applause for being a real meany.
Applause
Part the resistance, and we’ll talk about it in Street Hypnosis, how to not set 
a frame up so they fight you, but it might be that he’s still a bit concerned or 
scared and he doesn’t know what to do. So when you say, that’s it, just 
spread your feet a little bit apart. Look at me. Take a deep breath, and 
sleep. 
Oh no, I failed. That’s it. Just sleep. Close your eyes. Sleep all the way. 
That’s it. Relax and sleep all the way. Relax. Relax. Sleep all the way. 
That’s it. You’re doing great. That’s it, deeper, deeper and deeper now. I’m 
going to count from 1-5, on the count of 5, eyes open, wide awake, feeling 
absolutely amazing.
1 – Coming up slowly. 2 - 3 - and as you’re coming through your body – 4 –
and 5 – eyes open, wide awake. Great job. Well done. 
Give him a round of applause.
Applause
You saw resistance, right? The point is if you keep going and you have that 
mannerism and say its okay. Whatever’s going to happen will be fine 
eventually, they’ll get the hint of like, oh, I know what I’m supposed to do. I 
close my eyes, I relax and I let myself fall into this experience. That’s all. 
Does that make sense?

Does this make sense as a basic template of what you’re doing during 
these inductions? If you understand this, you can do any instant induction 
that you’ll ever come across, seriously.
Was it you that did the mobile phone induction? It’s pretty much like that. 
Somebody else’s eyeballs. Look into their eyes.
We’re going to just add a few more refinements onto that because again 
with the stage experience you’ll want to add a few more principles which 
are really important. Then we’re going to do a lot of drilling to get this into 
you, so it’s so much second nature that you actually start hypnotizing 
people when you shake their hand and be like sleep, oh I didn’t mean it
sorry, come back. 
I want to build on this a little bit. When he’s talking about how the mind goes 
down here – because in the subconscious mind, what kind of a mind is it? 
It’s a yes mind. The subconscious mind does whatever it’s told within 
reason. Correct? Do you guys know that? 
So when you do the rapid induction, what’s happening is the mind is going 
– because you take the body, basically, it’s going, where am I going, when 
you take it off of, its motion. The mind is going, what’s happening? So when 
it’s saying what’s happening, you’re saying sleep. Then it goes oh, okay. 
Got it. So that’s why the rapid induction works so quickly. Does that make 
sense? 
Somebody come up here. It doesn’t matter who it is. Yeah, come on up 
here. Just to show what that’s like. So when you have somebody – yeah, 
you can take your glasses off. Thanks. 
So when you’re doing that – and it doesn’t matter who you’re working with, 
it’s the same thing. The principle is like this. Just sleep. So what happens is 
– open your eyes – is the same thing is happening, is that you’re just – I tell 
people don’t snap your fingers like what you do to a dog, but I do it anyway. 
It looks good.
But it’s the same thing. You just say, look right here. Take a deep breath. 
Just sleep. So what happens is that when they’re coming down, the mind is 
going, well, what do I do? It’s looking for direction. Stand up. Right away. 
There you go. So it’s the same principle. Okay? 
I can’t impress that upon you more. The subconscious is a yes mind, so 
when you do this rapid induction, like this you just keep building on it. So 
when you keep giving suggestions, like sleep, that’s it, relax and go even 
deeper loosely, limply rocks, that’s good. There you go. That’s very good. 
Loosely, limply relax.

When you’re doing something like that, you’re just deepening the 
suggestions. It’s a compounding effect. One suggestion builds upon 
another one. Open your eyes, wide awake. Very good. Now you notice I 
didn’t say I’m going to count to five, wide awake. I just said open your eyes, 
wide awake. 
Is the trance terminated? 
Yes. No.
Ain’t gonna happen.
Nobody knows yet. 
It doesn’t happen. I never terminate trance. I don’t terminate. When I begin 
working with somebody, I never terminate the formal type of trance because 
the formal trance termination, which is what a lot of people do – in a 
moment, I’m going to count from 1-5. I will say fully aware. At that time 
you’ll be fully awake, feeling fantastic in every way, or whatever you want to 
pile onto that. 
So I just say sleep, very good, cool. If I want to go further than that, I could 
just say make your arm stiff and rigid. Make a fist for me if you would, 
please. Very good. Make that arm stiff and rigid and powerful. So, stiff and 
so rigid and so powerful that you cannot bend that arm, try to bend it. The 
arm will not bend. It’s stuck up there. 
Try as hard as you can. Reach over there and grab it. Try to pull it down. 
There you go. There you go. Try to pull it down. It’s stuck. It won’t come 
down. There you go. Isn’t that crazy? Tap you on the head, drop to your 
side. Go ever deeper to sleep. You see there? So that just becomes a 
compound technique. So you’re just building on it. 
Each time a person responds to a suggestion, it makes it easier for them to 
respond to future suggestions, right? Open your eyes, wide awake. 
We’ll get more into that later. I just wanted to share that with you very 
quickly. When you’re doing the rapid type of induction, the subconscious 
mind is a yes mind. You’re saying sleep, and the individual goes, okay. 
I build up that later on in the class, but I wanted you to have that idea in 
your mind on what’s going on psychologically. Thanks. Give Bill a round of 
applause. Make him feel good.
Applause
Pretty cool so far?

Are you glad you came?
Yes!
Good, now go home. I like that. Who said no? You can stay, all right? 
Everyone else, sorry. What we’re going to do now– may aim is by lunchtime 
to get you to do what you just saw happening here, would you like to do 
that?
Yes.
That requires speed drilling and just going for it over and over again. If you 
get the words slightly wrong no big deal, you just want to create the 
instincts for this. Does that make sense? 
Yes.
Okay. Everyone stand up please, with all the chairs to one side. 
As you’re moving your chairs over there, I’m going to talk to you for a 
moment, so go ahead and keep moving your chairs.
Keep moving your chairs over there as we talk.
Because there is going to be another dimension of this that we will go into 
later. I promise you.
All the chairs on that side please.
Because right now what’s happening is you’re learning some hypnotic 
inductions with who, a room full of hypnotists, right.
And, of course, at some point to be working with non-hypnotists. 
Non-hypnotists, and so you’re going to find the experience may be a little bit 
different. So we’re going to go into the dynamics of that later of what you do 
in the real world with real people, and how to overcome situations where 
maybe you’re going to have to really tweak that instant induction by creating 
rapport, and we’ll talk about that later.
Absolutely. So for the moment let’s just drill in the skills. Once your chairs 
are over there, please everyone come back to the center. Leave a corner in 
the middle for the camera.

Now, what we’d like you to do is please separate yourself into four columns, 
four rows, roughly equal number. It doesn’t matter who’s in which one just 
four rows. Just organize yourself so we’ll have – why don’t you stand over 
here. 
One row behind this young man, one row right behind Linda, one row over 
here and we’ll have one row right behind you here. Everyone else line up 
behind these four people please, in just roughly the same numbers. 
Two more lines over here.
That’s it. One line here and one line right here. Come on forward.
One, two, three four.
Okay, line up behind these buys.
We need six lines then. Six equal lines. 
Six equal lines. So, just line up over there. This line, you guys turn and face 
each other. You guys turn and face each other. You guys turn and face 
each other.
Make sure you have a partner. If there is no partner, move. Make sure 
there’s a partner right in front of you. If not, then move over.
Wait a second. Just make sure that you’re partnered up with someone. If 
you are, just shake hands with the person you’ll be working with. There you 
go. Do you need someone?
Is there anybody without somebody?
You guys, everyone shake hands with the person across from you, and 
then put your hand up if you do not have a partner. Everyone have a 
partner? All right we’re going to have a lot of fun here. This is drilling time, 
folks. 
This line right here is going to stay static. So this line right here, this line 
right here is going to stay static. This line right here will stay exactly where 
you are. The second line, the one I haven’t touched yet, this line over here, 
second line, second line. You guys facing this wall, you’ll be moving around 
one each cycle.

So what we’re going to do is if you just walk to the end and everyone moves 
down one, just go ahead and move there. Everyone move down one. The 
same with you, Martin, just move to the end. Everyone move down one. 
Move to the end. Everyone move down one. 
If you’ve ever done speed dating, you know what we’re doing. 
Laughter
This is how hypnotists speed date. Guys or girls, it doesn’t matter. This is 
Vegas after all. All right, so you get the idea of this? Folks, just pay attention 
a second. You get the idea of this so far, right?
Yes.
What we’re looking for here is speed and smoothness. So let’s that try 
again. Front row move on around. That’s it, quickly. Move down quickly, as 
quickly as possible. All right and do it one more. Move one down. Okay
good. Pause, folks. Don’t worry about introducing yourselves yet. All right, 
pause, everyone. 
For this exercise, please do not concern yourself about introductions. In 
other words, just pretend that they’re there to be hypnotized and go straight 
for the hypnosis. The reason for this is we don’t want too much setup, chit 
chat and everything else. We want trance and trance after trance. Does that 
make sense to everyone?
Yes.
The only thing you’ll do – and for people who are wearing glasses, you may
want to take them off if you can see okay. Otherwise, if you want to keep 
them on, make sure that you take the glasses off your partner before you 
start the trance when you go in. 
My preference is you keep them off. You’ll probably lose them up there as 
well, so keep them off. Maybe pop them to the side somewhere. You can 
put them on the stage and they’ll be safe or you can put them in your 
pocket, but make sure they’re somewhere where they can’t go flying 
anywhere. Does that make sense?
Yes.
So everyone, if you have short sight and you have your hands up, then you 
can’t put your hand up, right? Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to 
start with exactly what you did a moment ago, which means – I’m standing 
opposite Collin. This side’s going to be the hypnotist first; that side will be 
the hypnotist second.

I’m going to assume I have everything already. The only thing I’m going to 
do is – he’s not even going to be looking at me. The only thing we’re going 
to do is put my hands on. That tells you I’m good to go. 
Sleep. All the way down, deeper, deeper. That’s right, deeper. Good. Eyes 
open, wide awake. Excellent, well done! Then he’ll do the same to me, then 
we’ll switch round and the next one goes round. Does that make sense? It’s 
very simple. 
I want you to listen to our voices. The reasons are:
1. We’ll be saying things as you go along. Don’t worry about them too 
much. Just let them wash over you.
2. When I say switch, it means the person in the front over here, here 
and here will go to the back and everyone moves down as quickly as 
possible. If you haven’t had a go yet, that means you have to go 
faster. Make sense?
Yes.

All right, everyone. Look at your partners and put them out. Quick. Go. 
Pause- Stop what you’re doing. Can we see how many people we are 
here? Can you count out say 1-2-3 and so forth? Responses with 
numbers by rows
-Mixing it up, organizing rows.-
Let’s have 3 cups without water given to the last person on the left hand 
side. Everyone with a cup in the air, you are the end-point and the start 
point, the Alpha and Omega. What we’re going to do is a competition. In 
other words, he will trance him out, he will go the opposite and as soon as 
you’re done you’ll race to the back, everyone moves one down.
Your aim is to get the person with the cup to the front as quickly as possible 
without skipping a single person. Does that make sense?
Yes.
This will be mayhem I warn you. Folks, wait. I strongly recommend that as 
you do this you pay extra attention to their balance, because people will 
start to go at this point.
Control their balance. Make sure they’re safe above all else, but move the 
lines as quickly as possible. Any questions? Both people have a go. No one 
gets left behind. Are we ready for this?
Yes.
Off you go.
It’s getting close folks. Those cup bearers are coming forwards. The 
Olympic flame is almost ready to pop, who’s going to make it? Quickly, 
speed up. The faster you go the more likely you are to win. The cups 
coming closer to the end.
For $1 million dollars. Oh boy, here goes.
The last few people are up.
Almost, I think we have a winner.
As soon as you’re going the other way you win. Quickly, go the other way 
and you win.

Instant Induction Number 2

Student:
What we’re going to do now is we’re going to start going into different styles 
of instant inductions, just so you see the same principles in action. We’re 
going to break it down, bit by bit. Do you want to take the first bit?
Come on up here. There are other thing’s that you can do when you have 
something you can just be next to them and you’ve got a nice little hold on 
them, you’re making sure they’re not going to fall over. 
Look right here, and just sleep. So it’s another way that you can do an 
instant induction, wide awake. Did you see that? I say look right here. Take 
a deep breath in, and just sleep. It’s really a very simple technique. 
Now I’m watching a lot of you guys out there, and when you’re doing this 
you’re going, sleep, and you can do that very gently, and that’s cool, but do 
you want to be very dramatic? Look right here. SLEEP! So you can be a 
little more dramatic, and I’m telling you something, that when you add in 
that element of SLEEP, what happens is they go, oh shit, okay, whatever 
you say! 
No kidding, because you’re shocking the nervous system. The nervous 
system is part of the autonomic part of your conscious mind that says, yes 
sir. It knows that you mean business.
Wide awake. Okay, did you guys see that? Do you want to see it one more 
time? 
Yes.
Let me see how your hand is?
How my hand is? 
Turn around. Do it backwards. Turn so you’re facing backwards. There you 
go. 
Here’s the rear end. It’s just like you’re out on a date. That’s all it is. It’s my 
date. 
Damn.
The instant butt induction. How are you doing?
I’m good.

So it’s the same thing. You want to do this because it looks good, but you 
can just go, SLEEP. So I’m just going to give you a little pull. Just, SLEEP. 
You guys got that? Front and back. Turn around. One more time; sleep. 
Okay, wide awake. 
So it’s just going to be three simple phases. 
1. Put your hand around them to feel their balance.
2. Pull them in and say, sleep.
3. Lift their hand up at the same time to create a little bit of eye 
distraction. 
Is that simple? What I want you to do is stay in the line you’re in now. 
You’re not going to move around. You’re going to do backwards and 
forwards a few times to get used to it. Then we’ll start the competition 
again. 
And don’t worry if the person next to you is bigger than you are. That does 
not matter. Just put your arms around their waist and say, sleep. So you 
can do the same thing with your arm around their waist or on their shoulder. 
It doesn’t matter. Just remember that you are the one who’s controlling the 
scenario. 
Okay, any questions so far? Can we have some microphones here, please? 
Run rabbit. Okay, it’s not necessary to shake hands with your partner again. 
Put your hand up if you have no partner. Did we lose someone half way 
through? There you go. So go ahead.
The question is when we leave here and we start to do it to people…
We won’t do that. With other people, we’ll talk about this later. For now, 
we’ll just get used to the drill, and we’ll add those bits and pieces in later. 
Make sense? 
Left hand or right hand? 
Who cares? Seriously, who cares? All right. Are we good? Everyone ready? 
So with a partner – are you missing someone. 
He’s right there.
Oh, he was hiding. You scared him, didn’t you? All right, guys do three or 
four one way. So you’ll do three or four in one go, then you’ll do three or 
four in one go. Just get used to the dynamics, and then when we’re ready, 
we’ll start the competition again. We’ll move the cup to the back and see 
how quickly they can come forward. Does that make sense to everyone? 
So let’s start the first round first. 

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
13
                                 
So this side to three first in a row, and then the other side will do three in a 
row. Then we’ll pause, and we’ll actually start the competition up again. 
Ready to go? Off you go.
Okay, everyone. Just pause. Has everyone had three or four go’s? Yes? All 
right, is this easy to do? 
Yes.
Did you notice how you have to be extra careful on this one to maintain 
people’s balance? This is something you have to learn as a hypnotist. So 
feel it, get used to it and just do it. 
So who’s got the cups right now? Put the cups up in the air please. Did you 
get rid of your cup? There you go. All right, move the cups to the back of 
the room. Cups in the back. We’ve got two cups. All right, that’s cheating. 
Give me that cup. That’s my cup.

Oh, man, this is too much fun. Are you guys having fun? 
Yes!
Does anyone here still feel nervous about doing instant inductions?
No.
Anyone? Put your hand up? Do you feel nervous? Anyone? All right this is 
good. Okay, so I think what we can do now is – should we do that or should 
we do the language?
Go ahead and go to the language.

Master Hypnotic Language
Igor:
Students:
Okay. We’ll step it down a pace. The magic cups can go away again. Now, 
again, those of you who have trained with me before will be familiar with 
this exercise. We just want to get to the idea of language now so you’ll start 
knowing how to speak as a hypnotist, as opposed to just how to perform 
like one. Does that make sense? 
Both are important. If you’re not performing like one, well then, the words 
themselves won’t do anything. If you have the words to back up your 
performance, of course, they get more powerful. 
Let’s see how to speak like hypnotists. Everyone just come forward, crowd 
into here please. Make sure you leave a nice space in the middle though, a
nice little corridor right here. Pretend the chairs are still there. Feel free to 
pop to this side.
Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to start playing with the power 
words, and I know you’re kind of becoming familiar with them. So you’ll get 
to go crazy with them. 
For those of you who are not familiar with power words, it’s just a way of 
speaking hypnotically using the language of the unconscious. Essentially, 
the unconscious mind reasons through association, did you know that 
before? Well, you do now.
We’re going to have words that allow you to associate one idea with 
another, and that allows you to smoothly flow between things. The first word 
I would like you to do use, because it’s simple, is the word 
. It 
allows you to link two ideas, which may not necessarily be linked. 
To keep it simple and keep it easy, what I want you guys to do is go around 
the room and tell people just the milling exercise at the beginning, just talk 
them and link any random idea with any other random idea through the 
word 
. The key here is to make it random. 
Don’t try to make sense of this. Don’t try to be sensible. It can be as garbled 
as hey, Colin, because you’re standing here, the sky’s going to fall down on 
my head. It doesn’t matter what you’re saying. What I want you to get to the 
point of is where your mind doesn’t quite know what’s going to come out of 
your mouth next. All that you know is that somewhere this word will turn up. 
Does that make sense to everyone? 
Yes.

So X 
Y. Is that easy to do? 
Yes.
What I want you to do is go through as many people as possible saying 
that. They’ll say one back to you. You have a little laugh, and then you’ll 
move to someone else. Speed is of the essence here. The faster you go, 
the better you’ll do in this course. Easy?
Yes.
Off you go. 
Okay easy, right. We’re going to push you guys through the language a little 
bit because you guys are way ahead of the game. So with the same idea, 
with the idea of 
.
you look at me, you’ll be a great hypnotist.
you walk outside, there will be people there that you can 
hypnotize. Shock- horror.
Now that makes a little bit too much sense, so we might go with something 
more like:
a deer comes into the room, the butterflies have 
starvation problems. 
Seriously, I’d like you to initially become very random with this because it 
forces your brain into a different cycle. Can you feel your brains working, 
guys? Yes? So is that easy to do? 
XY. Everyone understand 
this?
Yes.
All right. Off you go.
Is that easy to do?
Yes.
Okay. So let’s do another one –
. X 
Y.
Those doors are there, 
you’ll be a great hypnotist.

There a carp in this room, 
you will have flowers in your 
ceiling. I don’t know why, but it does.
Is that easy to do? So shall we make it a little bit more challenging? Let’s do 
all three at once. 
you’re listening here, it means the butterflies outside are 
having a happy time. W
you speak something random, they 
will smile, 
that you’ll learn hypnosis more easily than 
ever before. 
Easy to do? You do not – let me emphasize this – you do not want to be 
making sense at all. So, I apologize if I made a bit too much sense there, as 
random as possible, that’s what we’re looking for. Is that easy?
Yes.
All right. Off you go. 
All right, easy.
No.
All right. Your brains should be whirling at a crazy mile an hour, but at least 
the language is starting to pop out. Is that right? Yes? Good. Fine. You’re 
exercising your brain, which is good.
We’re going to add one more layer. The phrase 
, or better still, 
For example:
those butterflies 
you to relax. 
You’re here 
the sky is purple. 
the sky is purple, 
people stand around, 
they’re looking at things, and 
that those people that you are a part of 
to look at those 
things in ways that are purple.
So, again, it doesn’t need to make sense. I hope what I’m saying is not 
making sense because if it is, then you guys need to stop taking whatever 
you’re taking. 
What I want you to do is go through those four in a cycle, again, not making 
sense. Then we’ll start turning it in to something more hypnotic. Is that 
good? Easy to do? Again, the more you do it, the easier it becomes. Your 
brain is just beading up. You should feel it like right on the edge of 
something. Like you’re about to fall off something.

That’s perfect. Especially as stage hypnotists, you want – in fact, you need 
to be able to think on your feet because lots of stuff will be happening, and 
this gets your brain ready for it. Make sense? Off you go. 
All right, guys wow! You guys are picking this up way quicker than usual. I 
like this. We’re going to have to do this like crazy, running people around 
these drills more often. 
This is pretty straightforward now. Your brains are kind of working extra 
time trying to figure out what to say in the middle of it because it’s going to 
be random, but the language itself is straightforward, isn’t it? 
Now I thought we’d make it a little bit easier for you guys. Do you remember 
the XY construction? Because the butterflies are out there flying in their 
cycle, you’ll find that the Trumps and Donald are lower than you expect. 
So now what we’re going to do is take the same idea, but we’re going to 
make life easy. We’re going to start with something totally random. Why? 
Because when you’re on the stage, random things can happen, but I want 
to start utilizing it to move it towards something purposeful. 
What do we mean by terms like purposeful as a hypnotist? Well, when 
you’re in trance – did anyone when you did the whole trance thing feel a 
little bit more relaxed, yes anyone? Maybe get your hands up a little bit. Do 
you feel good? Do you have like a warm – not warm, but a glow and feel-
good feelings? Do you feel some kind of deepening process, like it 
intensifies whatever experience you had? 
So these are what we call deepeners. They make the experience they’re 
having more so. Here, we have some very simple themes. Relax, comfort, 
deeper and feel good those are the kinds of experiences you’ve been 
having whilst you’ve been going in and out of trances. 
Yes.
Thank you very much. So what you’re going to do now is exactly the same 
exercise. The X will be totally random – butterflies, purple-headed pygmies 
– I don’t care, whatever. The Y will be anything in this list. These are called 
trance themes. These themes make people feel more like they’re in trance. 
Does that make sense? So for example, 
Because those purple headed pygmies are outside waiting, it means you 
can... 
Relax.
And whenever you see a fantastic velvet mannequin, you will…

Relax.
There we go. 
Which means…?
You can go deeper.
Thank you and I know that you want to…
Relax.
Now is that difficult?
No.
No? It should be a lot easier than the last exercise. Remember, just keep 
half of it random – we’ll fill that in later – and half of it will be purposeful 
around the idea of deepening, trancing and so on. Make sense? 
Okay, spend two or three cycles with the same person, so you’re going 
through the whole list, in any order, I don’t care, two or three times with one 
person. They’ll do you and then you’ll go onto the next person. Make 
sense? Off you go. 
Are you guys enjoying this?
Yes!
It’s easy to do now, isn’t it? Isn’t this easier to do now that you actually have 
to make sense, rather than when you’re not. Isn’t that crazy? Half the time 
people are afraid of, how can I make this make sense? Actually, it’s easier 
to make than not, so you may as well, right? I know I can’t help it. 
Why are we doing this? This is the essence of hypnotic language. You 
realize that these words, there’s no magic behind them as they are? In 
other words, you don’t have to burn these into your mind and only use 
these. They’re examples of words that allow you to associate one idea to 
another. Does that make sense?
If you want more power words, there’s a deck of cards in the back called, 
The Street Hypnosis Deck. They have lots of examples. You can make your 
own now because you can come up with phrases like, more of this and 
more of that, sooner or later. These are all phrases you can kind of up 
make up on your own.

Deeper Trances
Students:
Igor:
What we’re going to do now is start using these purposely in terms of your 
hypnotic process. Hands up if you can do an instant induction. That should 
be all the hands right now because you’ve been doing it all morning. Are 
you a little bit afraid? Then I have a great exercise just for you coming up 
after lunch. I’m going to remember. Don’t worry. 
So you can do an instant induction. Remember, the bit that matters on the 
instant induction is not the induction, it’s what you do immediately 
afterwards. You want to keep that firm in your mind. It does not matter what 
I do for the induction. It’s what I follow up with that counts. 
The induction is easy. It’s like can anyone say the word sleep?
Sleep!
With conviction. I like that. The actual induction is not difficult, is it? So what 
we’re going to do now is stabilize the trance. How are we going to do this? 
Well, exactly how you just did there, which is you’re going to take one idea 
and one experience and associate it to something else. 
What kind of things would you want them to associate, or what kind of 
experience would you want them to have to stay more in this trance? This is 
technically known as deepening. 
Can I just borrow you guys for a minute? Face this lovely crowd over here. 
Take a deep breath. Sleep. All the way down, deeper. That’s right. 
Deeper and deeper because whenever you feel that relaxation 
becoming more comfortable, you’ll go deeper into trance, which 
means your amazing capacity to be a great hypnotist improves and 
skyrockets. So you may as well feel all that comfort growing stronger 
and stronger now. 
The stronger it feels, the more you relax. The more you relax, the 
better you feel. The better you feel, the wider your mind opens to 
becoming a great hypnotist and you know what I mean by that, don’t 
you? Very good. In a moment, I’m going to move you up so you have 
your own balance, but stay deep in trance. 
That’s right. There we go. Every time you feel this, you can just go 
deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. 
Do you see the association from one thing to the other? 

© Street Hypnosis Publishing All Rights Reserved
21
                                 
And every time you feel this, your rate of confidence as a hypnotist 
just grows stronger and stronger and stronger. 
Notice how now I’m doing physically the same thing that you just did with 
language earlier on.
And you can relax. That’s right. Relaxing even more, that’s right, 
even more deeply. Each time you feel this, that’s right, deeper. 
That’s right, deeper. That’s right, deeper. 
Notice how we’re just doing simple movements. You can add the physical. 
It can actually be just intellectual in terms of the ideas.
Which means, you’re going to be even more comfortable, relaxed 
and ready to absorb all these hypnotic lessons and learning’s, just 
you wait to get back to school. Those kids will not know what hit 
them. That’s right. You can imagine that now, can you not? Enjoy it. 
That’s good. 
In a moment, I’m going to count from 1-3. At the count of 3, eyes 
open, wide awake. 1-2-3, eyes open. 
Good job. Give him a nice round of applause. 
Applause
Well done. Now everything you just saw, that’s not rocket science, is it? 
You can do all that. So what I want you to do now is exactly this. Spend like 
a minute or so with each person and then move on again. Volume will be 
more important right now. 
What I want you to do is put them in trance, and then use a combination of 
this principle, which is associate one thing to the other. You can use the 
language. Because I’m touching you on the shoulder, you’ll relax more. 
That’s right, relax more, and so on. 
Use something physical so you can do a physical deepener – with the 
tapping, the touching and the rocking – or you can use the actual language 
or you can use both. Honestly, right now I don’t care. It’s up to you. You’re 
the hypnotist, right?
Who’s a hypnotist in this room?
I am.
That’s what we like to see. Any questions? Great! Well, off you go.

Rock n’ roll. Is he still a little unsteady on his feet? That’s good. Are you 
guys having fun?
Yes!
What do you notice happening as you’re doing these deepening 
processes? 
They go deeper.
They go deeper. Do you feel it as a subject? Do you feel yourself getting 
more relaxed?
Yes.
More comfortable? 
Yes.
So something’s working. All you have to do is create that expectation, 
create that association and it will happen. As long as you just go with it. 
Now some people might be a bit more problematic than others. That’s fine. 
Do you know why? If you’re a stage hypnotist, you don’t use those people. 
You have like the law of numbers in your favor. So you always work with 
the people you enjoy working with. That’s the beauty of this game. 
You’re not a hypnotherapist, which means you don’t have to work with that 
particular person. Actually, even as a hypnotherapist, you don’t have to do 
that. The point is you get to choose who you want to work with and who you 
don’t. If you don’t feel like it, just say, you know what, you have a beard. I 
don’t like beards. Off my stage, if you feel like it. 
Don’t do the whole beard thing you might offend them by it.

Fractionation Deepener
Students:
Igor:
Here’s what we’re going to play with now. You’ve got the idea of deepening. 
Have you been noticing that as the days continue, they become easier and 
easier to drop into this trance and it’s more useful? 
What’s going on here is something called fractionation. Here’s what we’re 
talking about. Basically, hypnotists found that when you put someone in 
trance, they come back and they go to a certain depth. Then the next week,
they’ll put someone in trance and they’ll go a little bit deeper. The next week 
they come back, and they’ll go a little bit deeper still and so on.
So each time their depth, their quality of experience becomes more intense. 
It’s kind of a learning process. Like most things you learn, you go, oh I know 
which way to go with this and you let go into it more and so on. 
So then they discovered that rather than have to do this in three different 
weeks, you could do this in three different days. In fact, you could do it in 
the same day. In fact, you can do it right after one another so that it’s in the 
same session. 
We’re going to put everything you’ve learned so far together to create this 
wonderful deep trance for people, and it’s going to be a lot of fun. Are you 
ready for this?
Yes!
I like a volunteer who wants to experience a wonderful deep trance. Come 
on up Scott, how can I say no to excitement like that?
Okay, look at me and sleep. All the way down, deeper. That’s right, 
deeper. And stand on your own balance. That’s right, very good. On 
your own balance but going deeper and deeper still. Okay, every 
time you touch on the shoulder here, deeper, deeper, deeper still. 
Okay, open your eyes, wide awake. 
And sleep. All the way down, deeper, deeper, deeper. Back on your 
own balance, your legs carry your weight perfectly. Deeper, deeper, 
deeper still, okay, open your eyes, wide awake. 
And sleep. All the way down, deeper, deeper, deeper.
Are you noticing a slight improvement of responses as we go along?
And deeper still, that’s right, deeper still. Okay, wide awake. How are 
you doing?

Okay.
Okay sleep, all the way down, deeper, deeper, deeper still. 
And now you can start using your skills if you want to start playing the role 
of a true hypnotist. 
From now on, every time you hear me say the word sleep, and I’m 
looking directly at you, just in the context of this training, when I look 
at you and say the word sleep, you’ll go to this state or even deeper. 
Always remembering – that’s right. Very good. Always remembering 
to maintain firm balance on your legs so you’re safe at all times. Nod 
your head if you understand. Very good.
So just to recap, every time I look directly at you and say the word 
sleep, you’ll go instantly into a deep a state as this or even deeper, 
only in the context of this training, so you can have wonderful deep 
trances. Nod your head if accept and understand that. Very good. 
Wide awake. How are you doing?
Okay.
You may as well, right?
Sleep. That’s right. All the way, all the way, all the way that’s it. Very 
good. 
One word, crazy power. No, you’re just setting it up. It’s just a natural 
part of the process. 
Okay and wide awake. How are you doing? Are you feeling great 
here?
Yeah.
Okay, this one’s going to be the real killer.
And sleep, all the way, all the way that’s right, deeper- deeper. Let 
your unconscious mind start taking this on board. Your ability to go 
into deep trances like this helps you become a great hypnotist. If you 
can do it, everyone you work with can do it. That’s right. 
The way you feel right now, every single one of your subjects in a 
stage show or in a demonstration, or actually just the hypnotherapy 
clients will feel this good and go this deep and respond this 
powerfully. So you should feel really good about yourself doing that. 
That’s right.

In a moment, I’ll touch your shoulder again on the side like this, and 
you’ll be wide awake feeling actually amazing, feeling better than 
you’ve felt in weeks, feeling so good, the thrill of energy going right 
through you. You’ll want to be doing this with people straightaway. 
You simply can’t wait. You will want me to stop taking just so you can 
go out there and grab someone and do this with them.
Nod your head if you understand what I mean. Very good, wide 
awake, all the way awake. There you go. 
Good stuff. Very good. Give him a round of applause. 
Applause
Is that difficult, folks? It’s just doing what you did over and over and over 
again. It’s like doing that little line-up you did before, only on the same 
person. That poor person is going to have such a good time. It’s unreal. Do 
you want me to say anything more about this, or are you pretty much ready 
to dive in and do it? Do you want to do it?
Yes.
Off you go. 
All right, folks. How do you feel? Can we have a little bit of space in the 
middle here? How are you feeling guys? 
Good.
Are you having fun?
Yes!
Do you want more?
Yes!
You better come back after lunch then because it’s that time of day already. 
So what I’m going to ask you guys to do is – we may as well leave the 
chairs here. Do you guys need chairs because we’re going to be doing lots 
of active stuff anyway? So if you want to sit down, just grab a chair and chill 
out for a little bit, but then come back up and we’ll do lots of work.
The key thing is who here right now feels relatively competent as a 
hypnotist? Not necessarily that you have it all down pat, but relatively 
competent.

Now far be it for me to suggest that as you go into lunch, if someone 
catches your eye and you tell them, I’m a great hypnotist. I’m doing a show 
here in Vegas on Sunday. Come. Free tickets if you like. 
You’re allowed to invite whoever you want to the show on Sunday, by the 
way. You realize this, right? So if you meet people – the room is going to be 
the size of half of this room. There are going to be two different – we’ll talk 
about that later on, but essentially, you’re allowed to bring anyone you wish 
to. You don’t have to, but if you meet people, you may as well. 
We’ll talk more about the dynamics of how that show is going to work and 
stuff like that a little bit later on. Probably tomorrow morning. For the 
moment though, just go out there and just have fun. If you want to put each 
other in trance whilst having lunch, who’s to stop you? 
It’s a little different in here than out there, so you may as well get used to 
different venues. Now if you get a little bit carried away and someone looks 
at you and goes, oh my God, what the hell did you just do to him? You’ll say
come over here and I’ll show you.
Laughter
There’s nothing that says the hypnotic context is better then you zoning 
someone else to the floor. So you may as well hook up with a buddy. This 
will be a fun thing to do. Stone each other during lunch and as people are 
staring, just invite them over and just say do you want some? 
Laughter
Sound like good fun? All right, guys any last words from you or should be 
just send them to lunch?
No, I do have one last word. I just noticed this, and I should have noticed it 
earlier, but here it is. When you’re doing this with somebody else, if they’re 
chewing gum or if they’ve got something in their mouth, make sure that they 
spit it out because they can choke on it, and you don’t want that 
responsibility. 
So that’s the only thing that I noticed that I wanted to add. Even in this room 
or out of this room, if you want to mess with somebody, if they’re chewing 
gum or they’re sucking on candy, make sure that they take it out and 
terminate it. That’s it.
That’s a good bit of advice. Thank you.
