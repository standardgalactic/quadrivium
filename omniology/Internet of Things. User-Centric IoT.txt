IOT360 2014 - User-Centric IoT
Preface
This volume includes the proceedings of four conferences dedicated to the role the
Internet of Things (IoT) plays in user-centric technologies and applications in different
domains. The 44 revised full papers in this volume were carefully reviewed and
selected from a total of 67 submissions. The conferences also featured six special
contributions from recognized experts in the ﬁeld.
The ﬁrst conference, COIOTE, focused mainly on artiﬁcial intelligence techniques
for the ever-growing ﬁeld of the IoT, a ﬁeld expected to produce deep transformations
on physical things as their virtual counterparts become more and more capable of
autonomous behavior.
The second one, PERGAMES, focused on how to best leverage on IoT-gathered
data in many application domains, leading to the design and deployment of pervasive
games for various sectors, such as health and well-being, ambient-assisted living, smart
cities/societies, education, cultural heritage, tourism and more.
The third conference, HealthyIoT, provided the health-related ﬂavor of IoT, relating
to the use of more widely available and adopted wearables.
The fourth conference focused mainly on the integration of smart objects and on the
most advanced operational technology trend of cloud-based “Everything as a Service”
where an appropriate cloud should support a high level of “as a service” paradigm. This
deployment paradigm will enable the easy adoption of IoT-based services and appli-
cations by end users, while calling for smart object providers as well as platform
middleware providers to architect their solutions accordingly.

First International Conference on Cognitive Internet
of Things Technologies – COIOTE 2014
Rome – October 27, 2014
Preface
The First Conference on Cognitive Internet of Things Technologies, COIOTE 2014,
took place on October 27 at the NH Leonardo Da Vinci hotel in Rome, Italy. The main
focus of the conference was on artiﬁcial intelligence techniques for the ever-growing
ﬁeld of the Internet of Things (IoT), a ﬁeld expected to produce deep transformations
on physical things by making them more intelligent. We are pleased to conﬁrm that the
whole experience including delegates from industry and academia was very fruitful,
with many interesting new ideas and technical discussions.
Our Technical Program Committee, co-chaired by Professors Artur Arsénio and
Erik Mannens, assembled an excellent technical program consisting of 11 papers in the
main track, including several invited submissions from top researchers in the ﬁeld.
Additionally, four other papers were grouped into a Special Session entitled “Affor-
dance in the Internet of Things (AIoT)”.
Upon reviewing various successful stories of intelligent machines adding value and
comfort to the human existence, Dr. Artur Arsénio highlighted in his keynote pre-
sentation the irrefutable beneﬁts of bringing intelligence into objects, a topic that was
highly appreciated among the attendees.
In the same agenda we included a COIOTE Panel session, organized by Dr. Franck
Le Gall from Easy Global Market, on an interesting topic about the relations between
IoT and the ﬁelds of cognitive sciences, nanotechnologies, and biotechnologies.
On behalf of the Organizing Committee of COIOTE 2014, we would like to thank all
the authors who contributed their valuable work to the conference, and the TPC members
and reviewers for maintaining the quality of the technical program. We would also like to
thank our keynote speaker and panelists for contributing with their time, knowledge, and
wisdom. We thank the organizers of the AIoT special session, Alice Ruggeri, Luigi Di
Caro, and Alessio Antonini, for the added value to the conference. COIOTE 2014 would
have not been possible without the dedicated work of all abovementioned individuals.
This event was part of the IoT360 summit, endorsed and organized by the European
Alliance for Innovation (EAI) and technically sponsored by CREATE-NET. We are
grateful to the EAI staff, particularly to Ms. Giorgia Nisi, who tirelessly looked after
every detail in making this conference possible.
We hope that the papers included in these proceedings will serve as valuable ref-
erence for topics related to artiﬁcial intelligence in the context of the IoT.

International Conference on Pervasive Games
PERGAMES 2014
Rome, Italy, 26 October 2014
Preface
PERGAMES 2014, the First International Conference on Pervasive Games, was held at
LUISS Enlabs, Rome, on October 27, 2014, as a co-located event with the IoT360
Summit of EAI.
The conference focus was on understanding how to best design and deploy per-
vasive games for various sectors, such as health and well-being, ambient-assisted
living, smart cities/societies, education, cultural heritage, tourism and more. It aimed at
bringing together international researchers, IoT and game developers, as well as
industry delegates to address issues and trends, research, and technological advances in
the world of pervasive games for different application ﬁelds.
The conference was structured as a single-track, multi-session event. To encourage
active participation and the potential formation of new collaborations among attendees,
the atmosphere was kept informal and preceded by an organized group visit to the
VIGAMUS (Video-Games Museum) in Rome. Also, two interactive and gamiﬁed
sessions were carried out during the conference day, one focusing on group brain-
storming for the design of innovative game solutions and the other focusing on dis-
cussing their deployment and exploitation challenges.
Contributions to the conference were solicited in the form of full and short research
papers. After a thorough review process of the papers received, for which we thank the
Technical Program Committee, nine were accepted for presentation at the conference.
On behalf of the Organizing Committee of PERGAMES 2014, we would like to
thank EAI and CREATE-NET for technical sponsorship of the event. A special thank
also to the volunteer students from the Faculty of Architecture, University of Rome La
Sapienza, and to Prof. Ivan Paduano, in particular, for their local support and endless
patience.
Last but not least, we would like to thank all the authors who submitted papers,
making the conference possible, and the authors of accepted papers for their valuable
contribution.

International Conference IoT as a Service
IoTaaS 2014
October 27–28, 2014, Rome, Italy
Preface
These are the proceedings of the First Internet of Things as a Service (IoTaaS) Con-
ference. IoTaaS is an international venue for publishing innovative and cutting-edge
results on the convergence of next-generation technologies and methodologies
reshaping our way of living. This conference focuses on the Internet of Things (IoT) in
general and in particular on providing innovative and enabling capabilities “as a ser-
vice.” The cloud serves as the central focal point for consumption and delivery of such
technologies and applications.
The IoT era is widely seen as looming just around the corner, expected to have a
signiﬁcant impact on most aspects of entities of all kinds, from citizens through
enterprises small and large to government bodies. The amount of smart devices is huge
and grows at a staggering rate, while connectivity gets a wider coverage. Smart objects
are immersed in everyday life and the amount and variety of contextual data they can
produce, or the actions they can take on their immediate environment, is enormous. At
the same time smart objects are becoming more capable and sophisticated by having
stronger processing power, larger amounts of storage, and longer battery life.
For this trend to have a big impact, be successful, and be widely adopted and useful it
needs to be tightly integrated with the most advanced operational technology trend of
cloud-based “Everything as a Service.” IoT poses various speciﬁc challenges that are not
yet covered by existing cloud offerings, chief among these are the heterogeneity, security,
and scalability issues. In addition, developing and deploying IoT-based applications
should be made as accessible as possible such that the entry barrier for new innovations in
this area is lowered. Thus, an appropriate cloud should support a high level of “as a
service” paradigm. This deployment paradigm will enable the easy adoption of IoT-based
services and applications by end users, while calling for smart object providers as well as
platform middleware providers to architect their solutions accordingly. Moreover, the
same rule of thumb applies also for the ingestion and exposure of smart objects via the
platform. The supporting business model would support a pay-as-you-go paradigm,
enabling small to large entities to participate and contribute.
We received many good papers. These papers went through a rigorous review
process that selected the papers in the program. The selected papers cover a wide
spectrum of topics belonging to IoTaaS. We have papers on networking considerations
for IoT, platforms for IoTaaS, adapting to the IoT environment, modeling IoTaaS,
machine-to-machine support in IoT, as well as composite applications. We also have a

position paper on the third phase FI-PPP (Future Internet – Private Public Partnership)
project encouraging SMEs to start experimenting in this challenging new area. To top
all these interesting topics, we have two keynote talks. One by Aleardo Furlani from
INNOVA, who discusses enabling IoT business opportunities. The other by Peter
Niblett from IBM, with an industry view. We believe that this strong program laid a
concrete foundation for this conference for years to come.

PowerOnt: An Ontology-Based Approach
for Power Consumption Estimation
in Smart Homes

Abstract. The impact of electricity consumption in buildings on the
overall energy budget of European and North-American states is steadily
growing and requires solutions for achieving a more sustainable devel-
opment. Smart metering and energy management system can be hardly
aﬀorded by residential homes, for their cost and the required granular-
ity. Empowering smart homes with suitable power consumption models
allows to estimate, in real-time, the current home consumption on the
basis of currently active devices. In this paper we introduce an ontology
based power consumption model (PowerOnt) for smart homes, and we
discuss some application use cases where the proposed approach may
successfully be exploited. Results show that the modeling approach has
the potential to support energy eﬃciency measures into residential homes
with few or no metering devices.
Keywords: Power consumption · Ontology · Smart home · Electricity

Introduction
According to statistics from both the US Department of Energy and the Euro-
pean Union Energy Commission, electricity consumption will increase in the next
years, with residential and commercial buildings raising their aggregate ﬁgure
up to 73 % of the total yearly consumption. Smart homes can play a pivotal
role by enabling users to better organize their daily activities in order to reduce
the global home consumption, by suggesting and promoting new, more eﬃcient
behaviors and by preventing or postponing the activation of energy greedy appli-
ances, possibly coordinating with local power sources. Fine grained metering
is one of the key factor for these “energy positive” innovations in the homes
although implied costs still prevent its application inside home environments.
As a consequence, homes are still “locked” into a stale condition where only one
meter (if any) is installed and almost no policy can be applied. To overcome this
issue and start improving energy eﬃciency of residential habitations we propose
to enrich smart homes with explicit, machine understandable information, in
form of appliance-level power consumption data, either nominal or measured on

the speciﬁc device. Such a detailed modeling allows to estimate the total power
absorbed by a smart home by knowing device activations, only. If such a capabil-
ity is complemented by the availability of one, or more, real meters, estimation
can be improved and results may increase their accuracy scaling gracefully to
the full metering case, where every device is connected to a dedicated meter.
The PowerOnt ontology model presented in this paper is speciﬁcally designed to
model nominal, typical and real power consumption of each device in a home and
its modular design allows to plug the same model into diﬀerent ontology-based
modeling frameworks for smart homes.
2
Use Cases
To better exemplify how a relatively simple and abstract model of energy con-
sumption such as PowerOnt can positively impact the energy consumption in
habitations, we depict two diﬀerent use cases, of increasing complexity, where
power modeling assumes a crucial role for sustaining better consumption policies.
Meterless monitoring Many research contributions, in literature, show that
householders can decrease their electricity absorption by 5 %-15 % by just being
informed about their current energy consumption habits [1]. To make home
inhabitants aware of their current energy habits, most approaches exploit In-
Home energy Displays (IHDs) [2,3] showing the amount of power currently con-
sumed, the energy absorbed since a given start time and information to promote
positive changes in the householders lifestyle. Metering is a functional require-
ment for IHDs, if no metering information is available in the home, no feedback
can be given and no improvement can be achieved. By simply plugging PowerOnt
device descriptions into an existing smart home, i.e., by inserting a proper soft-
ware module into the existing smart home gateway, it is possible to estimate the
current home consumption from the activation states of the connected devices,
even if no meter is installed.
Better Practices Suggestion Given a smart home with one or more meters
installed, PowerOnt may be used by the home gateway to implement advanced
suggestion policies, stimulating positive changes of the home inhabitants behav-
iors. At every device activation, e.g., by means of a button, the home gateway
intelligence may, in fact, check the alternative ways for achieving the same ﬁnal
state, and suggest to activate the one having the lowest impact on the home
energy consumption. For example, imagine that the bathroom illumination can
be obtained by either switching on the bathroom ceiling lamp, or by raising up
the bathroom shutter. Every solution can be proﬁled under the electrical con-
sumption point of view, using information encoded in PowerOnt, and the less
consuming one can be identiﬁed. If the user does not select the best activation
(energetically speaking), the smart home can exploit IHDs to inform the inhabi-
tant of the existence of a better habit, e.g., raising the shutter instead of lighting
the lamp.

PowerOnt
PowerOnt is a light-weight ontology designed to model power consumption
of electrical devices and appliances in smart homes (see Fig. 1), supporting
the previously depicted use cases.
A minimal approach is adopted, reducing
Fig. 1. PowerOnt, class hierarchy
modeling primitives (classes and relations) to those strictly needed to support
power consumption modeling. Relations to described devices and appliances are
left “open,” i.e., their descriptions shall be completely formalized depending on
the ontology-based home/device model to which PowerOnt is connected.
3.1
Structure
Two main classes compose the ontology, namely poweront:PowerConsumption
and poweront:PowerConsumptionValue. They respectively model the kind of
power absorbed by a given device or appliance, e.g., electric power, and the
amount (value) of consumed power in terms of International System units,
e.g., Watt. The poweront:PowerConsumption concept is specialized into power-
ont:ElectricPowerConsumption, modeling electric power typically absorbed
by home devices and appliances. Devices can be described by either instantiat-
ing the type of power they absorb or by further specializing the electric power
consumption class and by instantiating the corresponding descendants, e.g.,
poweront:LampOnPowerConsumption that models power absorbed by switched-
on lamps. Power values are referred to their unit of measure by means of the
muo:measuredIn relation, deﬁned in the standard MUO ontology1, that relates a
poweront:PowerConsumptionValue instance to a muo:UnitOfMeasure instance.
Power consumption classes are related to (at least) one power consumption value
by means of the poweront:value relation. Such a relation is further specialized
to allow specifying typical, nominal and actual consumption values.
1 http://idi.fundacionctic.org/muo/.

6
D. Bonino et al.
Given an instance of a class descending from poweront:PowerConsumption,
e.g., of LampOnPowerConsumption, such an instance can be connected to: (a) a
typical power value derived from the consumption of a generic device of the same
type, e.g., lamps in a home typically consume around 60/90 W; (b) an optional
nominal power value declared by the device manufacturer, e.g., the living room
lamp has a nominal power consumption of 30 W; (c) an optional actual power
value measured on the real device, e.g., the living room lamp actually consumes
28,92 W.
Two “open” relations, respectively named poweront:consumptionOf and
dogP:whenIn, model the power absorbed by a given device in a given operating
condition. The former relates a device, expressed in whatever ontology (range
unspeciﬁed) with its corresponding power consumption described in PowerOnt.
The latter further specializes this relation by associating the power consumption
with a speciﬁc device operating condition, e.g., state; also in this case the relation
is left open to achieve maximum modeling ﬂexibility (range unspeciﬁed).
3.2
Sample Integration with DogOnt
To better clarify power consumption modeling through PowerOnt we consider
a speciﬁc integration sample, where PowerOnt is integrated with the DogOnt2
ontology model for Smart Environments [4]. Integrating PowerOnt and DogOnt
means exploiting DogOnt concepts as the ranges of poweront:consumption-
Of and of poweront:whenIn. In DogOnt, devices that can be connected to a
smart gateway, i.e., controlled, are modeled by the concept dogont:Control-
lable. Therefore, PowerOnt in DogOnt will specialize the poweront:consump-
tionOf range to dogont:Controllable. Moreover, since in DogOnt diﬀerent
device operating conditions are explicitly modeled by means of concepts belong-
ing to the dogont:StateValue hierarchy, the PowerOnt poweront:whenIn rela-
tion range will be set at dogont:StateValue.
The resulting integration is reported in Fig. 2 where DogOnt concepts are
reported in bold while PowerOnt concepts are reported in italic font. The
PowerOnt ontology integrated with DogOnt is available at http://elite.polito.
it/ontologies/poweront.owl.

Example Application
We can use the ﬁrst use case presented in Sect. 2 (Meterless energy monitoring)
as a practical example to exploit some PowerOnt functionalites. We can con-
sider the devices present in a bathroom: a lamp on the top of the bathroom
mirror, a shutter and the ceiling lamp. Only the shutter is metered. If we want
to obtain the consumption of such home appliances (metered or not), in order
to promote energy saving, we could use a SPARQL query, thus reporting either
the typical, nominal, or measured value. As shown in Fig. 3, SPARQL querying

is exploited to extract, for each controlled device ?device located in the bath-
room, the list of its state values ?stateValue and to further retrieve the power
consumption values ?consumption for each state value. Then, the typical con-
sumption value (?typicalConsumption), the nominal (?nominalConsumption)
and the measured one (?actualConsumption) are extracted, if available, from
?consumption.

Related Works
Several ontologies for energy management in smart homes have been proposed
in the literature. Most of them, diﬀerently from PowerOnt, are not modular and
they do not use standard ontologies (such as MUO) to deﬁne units of measure.

8
D. Bonino et al.
Example of such ontologies are the ontology part of DEHEMS, or the ontol-
ogy used by the SESAME project. The ontology part of the European founded
Digital Environment Home Energy Management System (DEHEMS) [5] project
aims at being adopted by vendors and manufacturers of home appliances to
create a uniform classiﬁcation of devices that allows automated reasoning over
their energy eﬃciency related characteristics. The DEHEMS ontology, in general,
associates each appliance with: a set of advice generated by the reasoning system
as recommendation to users in speciﬁc case of abnormal energy consumption; b
a “EU Energy Label Class” and a “Energy Star” rating for classifying the energy
eﬃcient of the device; c an indication about the “Wattage” used; d the value of
the “Wattage on Standby” (if the speciﬁc appliance supports it); e the “Energy
Consumed” in every possible state. The SESAME project [6], instead, uses an
ontology-based approach to describe an energy-aware home. It does not provide
appliances representation from the perspective of energy saving but it relies on
overall energy consumption, peak power and various tariﬀinformation as they
are provided by smart meter supplier.

Conclusions and Future Works
In this paper we introduce PowerOnt, an ontology based power consumption
model for intelligent environments, able to provide, for each controlled home
appliance, either a typical power consumption, a nominal or a measured con-
sumption. Future work includes the usage of PowerOnt in the open source Dog
gateway3 and the realization of the proposed use cases.

Abstract. Building Automation Systems control HVAC systems aiming at
optimizing energy efﬁciency and comfort. However, these systems use pre-set
conﬁgurations, which usually do not correspond to occupants’ preferences.
Although existing systems take into account the number of occupants and the
energy consumption, individual occupant preferences are disregarded. Indeed,
there is no way for occupants to specify their preferences to HVAC system. This
paper proposes an innovation in the management of HVAC systems: a system
that tracks the occupants preferences, and manages automatically the ventilation
and heating levels accordingly to their preferences, allowing the system to pool
its resources to saving energy while maintaining user comfort levels. A proto-
type solution implementation is described and evaluated by simulation using
occupants’ votes. Our ﬁndings indicate that one of the algorithms is able to
successfully maintain the appropriate comfort levels while also reducing energy
consumption by comparing with a standard scenario.

Introduction
Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for up to 60 % of
the total energy consumption of commercial buildings [1]. In modern buildings, HVAC
system settings are conﬁgured centrally on the management console of the Building
Automation System (BAS). Despite the fact that BASs aim at saving energy while
maintaining occupant comfort [2], HVAC settings are only reviewed seasonly to
account for large climate and occupancy variations. Indeed, settings are not adjusted in
real-time to take into account fast dynamics of occupant preferences leading to ov-
ercooling or overheating. In practice, since occupants cannot control the HVAC
thermal settings, they may experience discomfort while the system is probably cooling
or heating above what is required and wasting energy. If occupants were given the

opportunity to control the system, situations of excessive service delivery that energy
expenditure would be less frequent.
Energy management systems (EMS) are concerned with ﬁnding sources of waste
and acting to improve energy savings. EMSs corrective action also typically targets
HVAC systems in order to reduce energy waste. However, if occupants are not in the
loop, these improvements are under-optimal. An intelligent climate control solution
that takes into account occupant opinions regarding comfort is potentially capable of
minimizing the energy consumption while maintaining the occupants comfort.
Studies show that the use of occupancy detection techniques with light and HVAC
systems is beneﬁcial to energy optimization, reaching savings values from 10 % up to
50 % [3–5]. However occupancy detection does not always have an acceptable
accuracy rate. A promising approach is to use Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID)
systems to detect occupants with reliable accuracy, and retrieve occupants’ information
such as their comfort preferences. This can lead to a higher occupancy detection
accuracy and energy management control.
Maximizing occupant comfort from individual preferences is challenging because
preferences can be contradictory. Even if possible for occupants to change HVAC
system settings, it still may difﬁcult to reach a consensual set-point value so that every
single occupant feel comfortable. To date, there is no platform that maximizes comfort
by collecting information on the occupant preferences and (i) compute a setpoint which
will control the temperature based on their feedback, (ii) encourage occupants to save
energy by presenting them information on the other occupant votes, (iii) takes into
account occupants preference history to improve decision making, and (iv) makes
automatic decisions to conﬁgure the HVAC subsystem automatically.
This paper describes an approach that enables occupants of a given room to give
their opinion on HVAC system conﬁguration. A machine learning algorithm calculates
a setpoint temperature that best ﬁts their suggestions and ﬁnd the most appropriate
actuation to minimize energy consumption while at the same time maximize comfort.
The proposed system incorporates dynamic user feedback control loops in order to
optimize the energy/comfort trade-off.

Solution Architecture
The proposed solution tracks occupant through RFID card-reading, interacts with
occupants on a web-front displayed on their mobile devices, computes set-points and
sends commands to the HVAC sub-system through an OPC gateway. The system
architecture is depicted in Fig. 1. The system consists of the following modules [6]:
RFID Module that retrieves the users information from the RFID tag on a student card.
RFID card readers were mounted and two doors entrances and wired to two Arduino
systems (Arduino Board plus RFID and LCD shields), coupled to another system, a
Raspberry Pi, to aggregate the information of these systems and send it to the Storage
Module. An entrance acknowledge feedback is presented to the user on the (LCD)
screen (it could also be sent to a smartphone).

Backend Application Interface consists of the presentation layer running on the web
server to abstract the access to the database.
Storage Module uses a PostgreSQL Database to store and manage user information.
Application Core acts as the brain of the system, performing all computation including
the simulation and the learning algorithm. Some of the main functions are:
• Occupancy detection: Knowing and deciding if a user is on the room or not, based
on information received from the RFID System.
• User voting & feedback handling: Collecting user’s votes and send users feedback
regarding ambient variables.
• Setpoint calculation: Collecting the occupant’s votes, validate them and calculate a
new setpoint which minimizes discomfort.
• Learning algorithm: Learn information about occupant’s behaviour and predict a
best decision to make [7].
• Interaction with HVAC System: Send information about the new set-point and
receive information about the ambient variables.
2.1
Occupancy Detection Using RFID
In order to adjust automatically to occupant preferences, the system must know the
identities of the occupants. The main algorithm works in three stages: the ﬁrst one is to
detect the RFID tag (or student card), the second one is to route this information through
a Raspberry Pi and add a simple security layer to the information. Finally, in the last
stage, receives the information through a web service, adds a presence ﬂag on the user
database, saves the date, time and hour that the user entered the room and return the
response to the Arduino’s LCD and the entrance. Figure 2 depicts the ﬂow of interac-
tions that are triggered when a tag is read.

modules (the peripheral modules) on the right, the application core modules.

2.2
Setpoint Calculation
The setpoint calculation algorithm is responsible for gathering the occupants’ votes and
calculating a setpoint, which tries to minimize the probability of negative voting, thus
maximizing overall comfort for users in the room.
After a user votes, the Application Core starts by verifying if the user is in the
room; if not, the process ends with an error message. Next, it veriﬁes if the user has
already voted; if so, it automatically overwrites the last request, adds it to a queue and
stores it on the database with all the relevant information of the status of the room.
The system veriﬁes the voting queue at speciﬁc intervals. If the queue is not empty,
it calculates the new setpoint, cleans the queued requests and sends the new setpoint to
the HVAC system. Then, it returns to waiting on the queue. Figure 2b illustrates the
process. Setpoint computations are based always on the direction of the majority of
votes. Therefore, the temperature settings will converge to an average value where
most occupants feel comfortable. This algorithm assumes that a vote is correlated with
the dissatisfaction of the occupant regarding current temperature settings, so the
occupant wants to change it by voting to increase or decrease the temperature. The vote
calculation starts by collecting all the queued votes and calculating the number of
people in the room. It compares the percentage of votes relatively to the number of
people in the room. The difference between the votes to increase and decrease the
temperature should be greater than 10 %; if its not the case, the algorithm only cleans
the queue and does not change the setpoint. The calculation decides if the setpoint
should increase or decrease the temperature considering the majority of the votes
changing it from 1°C.
2.3
Learning Algorithm
By having users conﬁguring the HVAC System with votes, the overall performance
can be improved enabling the system to automatically conﬁgure itself. First it is
Fig. 2. (a) RFID System’s interaction with the Main Application. It starts by sending the read
tag ID to the Core, which veriﬁes if the owner exists and deﬁnes it as present or abscent. (b) Main
functions of the Application Core: Refresh ambient variables, calculates the setpoint periodically

necessary to gather all the votes, identify patterns into it and learn them to take
decisions in the future. Many learning algorithms are able to identify patterns on input
data with a large number of examples. In this particular case, the system will not have a
large amount of data to identify patterns. The analysed input consists of a stream of
users votes who want to raise, maintain, or decrease the temperature. After collecting
these votes, a learning algorithm is applied to separate this data into clusters according
to data similarity. This way, it becomes possible à-posteriori the auto conﬁguration of
the room’s setpoint without further needing the occupants to vote.
We employ an unsupervised learning algorithm to conﬁgure the setpoint according
to a prediction based on the actual status of the room. The application core achieves this
by loading the information about the room and comparing it to a set of previously
calculated scenarios. Then it decides which setpoint is most appropriate. The algorithm
retrieves the information on each vote made and saves it on the database during the
submission of a user request. The users vote will not interfere with the set-point
estimation, it is solely used for the purpose of training the Learning Algorithm. The
k-means algorithm [8] used is a method of cluster analysis that divides into k clusters a
set of n observations, each cluster S being associated with a centroid C. Each obser-
vation should belong to the cluster with the nearest mean. First, the algorithm starts by
mapping the clusters by choosing k random values and deﬁne them as the new cen-
troids, then it iterates and calculate a new centroid [9]. Each centroid is related to a
system decision. The algorithm calculates once per day the new centroids, updating all
the new requests and labeling each one of them, based on all previous votes, and new
ones made on the previous day. This method makes it possible to calculate the setpoint,
and simultaneously using data to train the algorithm to achieve better results. Once the
system has the clusters calculated, it takes the information on current variables such as
the indoor temperature, hour of day, number of occupants and calculates the cluster that
ﬁts better these variables. Then veriﬁes which is the decision (for temperature setpoint
deﬁnition) associated with the cluster.
3
Experimental Evaluation
The proposed algorithms were evaluated on a simulation of a real life environment
using EnergyPlus package. The simulation environment consists of a room where
occupants are able to cast a vote with the intent of setting the temperature, which best
ﬁts their comfort [6]. The system computes the new setpoint and adjusts the HVAC
system accordingly. The data collected in order to evaluate the system corresponds to
the overall daily comfort value, the daily mean energy consumption in KWh and the
mean daily setpoint. Two scenarios were considered.
In the baseline scenario, the temperature within the room did not vary throughout
the day, independently on the occupant’s votes. Simulations were made using ﬁxed
setpoints from 20-22°C. According to Fig. 3a and Table 1, the mean energy con-
sumption is 67,89 KWh, standard deviation of 9,37 KWh, and the mean confort value
is 75,7 with standard deviation of 1,58.
In the other scenario, the system adjusts the room temperature based on the learning
algorithm and occupants votes. The Learning Algorithm scenario was tested in two

experiments, one using k-means algorithm during 10 days of simulations to train it
employing 9 centroids (k = 9), and the other employing 3 centroids (k = 3). It is shown
that a larger number of clusters decrease energy consumption at a cost of a smaller
confort level. Such trade-off is also seen in both learning experiments compared to the
baseline scenario, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3b.

Conclusions
The use of BAS and EMS systems is becoming evermore common and sophisticated
and seeking to promote energy savings by integrating new sources of data, such as user
preferences, in real-time. Our hypothesis was that developing a learning system based
on occupants input could allow controlling a HVAC system, to minimize the energy
consumption while maximizing average user comfort. The results using the k-means
algorithm suggest that it is possible to allow a room to conﬁgure the HVAC system
based on a machine learning technique. Despite the comfort rate, which is approxi-
mately 5 % lower than the baseline, the energy consumption had a decrease of 5–KWh
on the mean consume. This suggests there was a reduction on the energy consumption
while abstaining from a higher occupant comfort rate.

Abstract. Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN), composed by
small sensing nodes for acquisition, collection and analysis of data, are often
employed for communication between Internet objects. However the WSAN
have some problems such as sensors’ energetic consumption and CPU load. The
massive storage capacity, large processing speeds and the rapid elasticity makes
Cloud Computing a very good solution to these problems. To efﬁciently manage
devices’ resources, and achieve efﬁcient communication with various platforms
(cloud, mobile), this paper proposes a middleware that allows ﬂows of AI
applications’ execution to be transferred between a device and the cloud.

Introduction
It is expect that in a few years our lives become more dependent of internet objects
connected by WSAN in areas such as environmental, medical, transportation, enter-
tainment and city management. Although there has been an evolution of the nodes in
WSAN, these continue to have limited battery, limited computation power, etc. Due to
these problems, the network node can crash due to lack of sufﬁcient resources to
perform, and jeopardize the smooth operation of the infrastructure. So, especially for
demanding AI applications, internet objects using sensors and actuators require speciﬁc
middleware for integrated operation with networked resources [1, 2].
Cloud computing provides attractive solutions for these issues [3]. Indeed, it allows
the reduction of the initial costs associated with the computational infrastructure.
Another relevant aspect is that the cloud computing resources are easily and auto-
matically adjustable according to the real infrastructure needs. This way, the compu-
tational resources are easily scalable following the growth of the infrastructure. Another
important point is related with the fact that the customer only pays for the cloud
resources that he actually uses. Mostly important, cloud computing resources provide
almost unlimited battery, storage, and computing power.
So, we need an efﬁcient solution that monitors the WSAN node capability to
execute operations, and communicates transparently with the cloud infrastructure.

Solution Architecture
The system consists of devices running applications (egg clients: cell phones, tablets,
and computers, as shown in Fig. 1a) and the cloud that makes data processing and
saves data. The communication protocols are TCP, UDP, SSH and HTTP Rest, and a
publish/subscribe model for internal communications in the device. Devices run
applications developed by programmers, having constraints such as limited memory
and battery (contrary to the cloud). These applications will run the management and
cloud client side modules for programmers to use our middleware. The former monitors
hardware components, and communicates to the cloud client whenever a component
reaches a critical condition. The cloud client interchanges application’s control mes-
sages and data to the cloud server module (see Fig. 1b).
2.1
Manager Module
The management module aims to determine hardware components state (battery, CPU
and memory), as well as the Wi-Fi connection state. The programmer deﬁnes each
component’s critical state on a conﬁguration ﬁle, before the middleware starts to be
used. Whenever one of these components achieves a value above a critical value (and
WiFi signal is strong) a certain execution will no longer be run on the device, being
transferred to the cloud. Figure 2a shows the management model’s state machine.
The management model is initialized in the “Middleware” state when the
“Application” state sends an initialization command. The “Middleware” state contains
the monitored component conditions, which are updated by the “Monitoring” state
through a shared queue between the two states. The “Middleware” state is always
checking the conditions of the Wi-Fi signal quality and the conditions of the battery,
CPU and memory, through calls to device hardware that runs the middleware. The
values obtained are compared with the critical values stipulated by the application
programmer. The load CPU analysis is a bit different from the other checks, because a
notiﬁcation is only sent if the read values are superior to the critical value for three
times in a row (to avoid reactions to sporadic peaks). If the signal quality of the
wireless network is below the critical value stipulated by the programmer the remaining
monitoring tests will not be performed. After each monitoring cycle of the hardware
components, the “Monitoring” state goes into sleep mode for one minute.

Intelligent Multi-Platform Middleware for Wireless Sensor
17

The “Application” state sends requests to the “Middleware” state on the conditions
of a component (e.g. battery). If the reply is “False” (transition between the “Appli-
cation” and “Function” states), it means no action is needed, since the state of the
component is below the critical status (and hence running with enough resources on the
device). This way the programmer’s application can continue to run without any
changes, and no event is initiated. In case of a “True” response sent by the “Appli-
cation” state, the machine transits to the “Do Something” state, meaning the component
exceeds the critical value. In this case the programmer chooses the actions to take after
receiving the message. One possible option is to use cloud platform provided services
for performing certain actions. This way it is removed some load on the device that is
running the application, releasing resources (e.g. memory).
2.2
Cloud Model - Client
The cloud module state machine is shown in Fig. 2b. The communication between the
application and the cloud is initialized when the programmer application makes an
initialization call to the middleware. The ﬁrst step is for the client to boot the server in
the cloud via an SSH command and to create TCP and UDP sockets. The access
settings of Post and Get commands of HTTP Rest protocol are also conﬁgured, so that
whenever the programmer intends an application to perform an upload or download of
information in the cloud, it is sent a Post or Get command to the cloud.
The middleware in the cloud responds (transitions between “Application”,
“Upload/Download” and “Cloud”) states either: (i) with a conﬁrmation that the
information was successfully saved; or (ii) there was an error while performing the
operation of storage; or (iii) the information as requested by the get command; or (iv)
error due to failure on obtaining the requested information.
In a blocking call connection, a message is sent to the cloud with the following
information: the function ID and its arguments. After the message is sent the state

“Blocking Socket” enters in a blocking state and waits for the result of the function that
is going to be executed in the cloud, delivered by the state “Reading Socket”. In the
non-blocking case, the state is not blocked after the message is sent (the program
continues to run). Once the cloud returns the response, this is saved in the device
memory until the program needs to access it. The state “Reading Socket” after being
initialized enters in block mode waiting for new entries in the socket that arrive from
the state “Cloud”. A new message on the socket will be processed differently
depending on the information of one message ﬁeld. If the message is from a blocking
function, the result is sent to the state “Sending Blocking”, otherwise the function ID
and its result will be stored in the device memory until the program needs the result.
2.3
Cloud Model - Server
The Cloud Server side module is initialized at the application server once it receives an
SSH connection with the start command, locking the “Cloud” state, and waiting to
receive messages from the client. Upon receipt of the message and its decoding, it is
possible to identify the function ID that is intended to be performed and its arguments
(going from state “Cloud” to “Function” state). The “Function” state consists of the
execution of the functions that were chosen by the programmer to run in the cloud. At
the end of the execution of a function a message is sent to the client (state “Reading
Socket) with the function ID and its result. It is also sent a small packet to identify if the
response is to the blocking or the non-blocking function.

Experimental Results Assessment
The metrics were the Percentage of Energy consumed and CPU Load. It was used 1 BQ
Edison with Android OS, and one virtual machine with one core and 1,75 GB of RAM.
We applied OpenCV to build a face detection and tracking application, heavy in terms
of CPU processing power, battery consumption and generated trafﬁc, since it makes
signiﬁcant image processing. Two experimental setups were implemented:
1. The baseline: the application that detects/tracks the human face is the only running
on the Android OS (no middleware).
2. Integration with the middleware: the same application only sends messages com-
posed with frames, getting these from the camera, and sending these to the cloud,
being the frames’ analysis made in the cloud.
3.1
Energy Consumed
The experiments on the 2 aforementioned scenarios lasted 40 min and were repeated 5
times. As shown in Fig. 3. and Table 1, there is no evidence of gains by transferring
some application execution ﬂows to the cloud. Results are even slightly better when the
middleware was not used (difference never exceeded 8 %).
Intelligent Multi-Platform Middleware for Wireless Sensor
19

This similarity may be due to excessive use of the video camera, which consumes a
lot of battery power, although this component is also used extensively without the
middleware. The constant access to the wireless network should be the largest impact
on the results, since the higher transmission rate implies higher energy spending [4].
3.2
CPU Load
To check potential middleware advantages in relation to CPU load, the “Face Detect/
Tracking” application was subjected to tests lasting 20 m and repeated ﬁve times.
In Table 1 and Fig. 4, there is a signiﬁcant gain with the migration of the detection and
tracking algorithms to the cloud. This gain is due to the heavier work done now in the
cloud, which alleviates the processing needs of the device’s CPU running the appli-
cation (just grabs image frames on the device and sends them).

Hence, in situations where applications compete for CPU time in processing
constrained devices, this solution can bring very interesting beneﬁts. The image pro-
cessing algorithms requires a lot of CPU load to be executed, which may prevent
simultaneously other applications to run properly. The same also happens with image
processing application that ceases to have the CPU just for itself, competing for
resources such as CPU processing time, and this competition may create difﬁculties to
its execution, such as a smaller frame rate, getting this way less frames per second.
To check if the middleware solution can solve this competition problem for limited
resources, the following test scenarios were performed: checking the CPU status
whenever an exhaustive analysis of 100 frames needs to be made, and checking the
time consumed for both processing these set of images in the tablet or in the cloud.
According to Table 2, CPU load reaches saturation values for single tablet pro-
cessing. But usage of cloud processing originates a signiﬁcantly lower CPU load at the
tablet. Hence the integration of the middleware may be beneﬁcial to run reliably
multiple applications on a device of limited resources, because with the transferring of
execution ﬂows to the cloud much of the processing is done outside the device, thus
freeing some of the CPU load, so that other device applications can also be executed.
4
Conclusions
This paper proposed a state machine based middleware to manage the transferring of
execution ﬂows between terminal devices and the cloud. The main goal was, using
cloud technology, to address the problem of a device’s lack of resources such as limited
memory and battery. Experimental evaluation showed that ofﬂoading the execution
ﬂows into the cloud does not necessarily reduces energy consumption (or increases
battery lifetime), because more battery energy may be required for wireless commu-
nications. Experiments indicate however that using the cloud to solve the lack of device
resources is quite advantageous, because it allows reducing the CPU load. This may
lead to battery with extended autonomy. But most importantly, it avoids applications
entering in blocking states due to lack of memory, and allows running more applica-
tions in a simple device that otherwise would exceed the available resources. The
decision whether to run an application locally or remotely is done dynamically,
according to the status of available resources, as checked through active monitoring.
More recently [5], we have successfully integrated the proposed middleware with a
WSAN platform, OpenHAB, for smart home automation.
This middleware will be most beneﬁcial for programmers who want to make the
most of the hardware resources available on the devices.

Abstract. In this paper, we advocate Agent-Oriented Software Engi-
neering (AOSE) through employing Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) intel-
ligent agents for developing Sense-Compute-Control (SCC) applications
in the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS). We argue that not only
the agent paradigm, in general, but also cognitive BDI agents with sense-
deliberate-act cycle, in particular, ﬁt very well to the nature of SCC
applications in the IoTS. However, considering the highly constrained
heterogeneous devices that are prevalent in the IoTS, existing BDI agent
frameworks, even those especially created for Wireless Sensor Networks
(WSNs), do not work. We elaborate on the challenges and propose pos-
sible approaches to address them.

Introduction
The Internet of Things and Services (IoTS) is an expanded version of the Inter-
net containing not only the components of the Internet such as Web 2.0, but
also constrained embedded devices such as sensors and actuators. As a crucial
infrastructure for Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), in which the physical world
merges with the virtual world of cyberspace [1], the IoTS is believed to have
suﬃcient power to trigger the next (i.e., fourth) industrial revolution. However,
it turns out that with this great power an enormous degree of complexity in
software systems is inevitable. This is due to a number of reasons such as the
tremendously large number of “things” (i.e., devices), heterogeneity of things
and services as well as the variety of communication protocols.
Sense-Compute-Control (SCC) applications [2] are a typical group of applica-
tions in the IoTS. A SCC application senses the environment (e.g., temperature,
humidity, light, UV radiation, etc.) through sensors, performs some computa-
tion (often decentralized, i.e., distributed) and ﬁnally prompts to take one or
more actions through actuators (very often sort of control) in the environment.

There exist two main diﬀerences between these applications in the IoTS and the
similar ones in the ﬁeld of Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN), a
predecessor of the ﬁeld of the IoTS. First, the scale of the network is quite diﬀer-
ent. While WSANs typically have several hundreds or thousands of nodes, SCC
applications in the IoTS may have several millions or billions of nodes. Second,
the majority of nodes in a WSAN are more or less similar to each other. However,
here in the IoTS we have a wide spectrum of heterogeneous devices, ranging from
tiny sensor motes with critical computational, memory and energy consumption
constraints to highly capable servers for cloud computing. Heterogeneity is a
property inherited from another predecessor ﬁeld, known as Pervasive (Ubiqui-
tous) computing [3].
One of the recent paradigms in software engineering that helps in dealing
with complexity is Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE). In fact, it is
the intersection of the ﬁeld of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), the successor of
Distributed Artiﬁcial Intelligence (DAI), with software engineering. Although
the research ﬁeld of MAS is only about two decades old, many methodologies
have been proposed in this area. They could be mainly categorized into two
groups [4,5]: software engineering (e.g., Gaia, Prometheus and O-MaSE) and
knowledge engineering (e.g., CoMoMAS, MAS-CommonKADS and Tropos). Our
focus here is on the former category, a ﬁeld that is known as Agent-Oriented
Software Engineering (AOSE).
AOSE helps in dealing with complexity in software development through rais-
ing the level of abstraction via the higher level concepts of agents, roles, orga-
nizations, collaboration, interaction protocols, etc. Yet, cognitive agents (e.g.,
BDI agents) raise the level of abstraction beyond that level. Moreover, MASes
are intrinsically peer-to-peer distributed systems with asynchronous communi-
cation often based on message-passing with unicast, multicast and broadcast
possibilities. This is a model which ﬁts perfectly ﬁne to the nature of SCC sys-
tems in the IoTS. Because, unlike web applications in the Internet, where the
client/server model is prevalent, in the IoTS the peer-to-peer network topology
(either pure or hybrid) makes more sense. Also, the asynchronous communica-
tion based on message-passing is much more scalable and eﬃcient comparing
other alternatives for distributed systems such as synchronous Remote Proce-
dure Calls (RPC), in which the client should block (i.e., busy-wait) until the
server ﬁnishes the processing of its request.
There exist several research works that have proposed BDI MAS approaches
for the IoTS, WSANs, etc. However, considering the fact that the majority of
heterogeneous things in the IoTS are highly constrained devices in terms of
computational power, memory space, energy consumption, etc., to our knowl-
edge, none of the proposed BDI-based approaches could work in practice for the
SCC applications in the IoTS. Therefore, as the main contribution, we propose
possible approaches for addressing this problem.
The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we explain the idea of employing
BDI agents for SCC applications in the IoTS, elaborate on the practical technical
challenges and propose two possible approaches for addressing those challenges.

This is followed by a brief review of the related work in this area in Sect. 3.
Finally, we conclude and mention our future work in Sect. 4.

BDI Agents for SCC Applications
Intelligent agents have a number of key properties which distinguish them from
other software paradigms. Some of them are listed below [4].
1. Autonomy: An agent can perform its task without any supervision.
2. Reactiveness: An agent reacts in a timely manner to the changes in its envi-
ronment.
3. Proactiveness: An agent is not only reactive, but also proactive in the sense
that it is goal-oriented and pursues its own goals.
4. Sociality: An agent interacts with other agents often through message-passing.
A group of agents collaborating with each other in order to achieve a common
goal form a society known as organization.
In a broad sense, the AOSE research area can be divided into two groups [6].
The ﬁrst group is more concentrated on the MAS paradigm as middleware (e.g.,
Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE) [7]), while the second one is about
reasoning-oriented agent frameworks (e.g., the Jadex BDI system [6]). Our dis-
cussion here is more related to the latter category, i.e., reasoning.
As mentioned in the previous section, cognitive agents provide a very high
level of abstraction for hiding complexity in AOSE. A number of cognitive archi-
tectures for agents have been proposed in the literature. One of the well-known
software models for cognitive intelligent agents is Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI).
BDI is not only simple to implement, but also corresponds nicely to the way
that people talk about the human behavior in psychology [6].
As depicted in Fig. 1, a BDI agent has a set of beliefs, a set of desires, a
set of intentions and a set of plans. Beliefs are informational attitudes about the
Fig. 1. Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents, ﬁgure inspired by [8]

26
A.H. Moin
surrounding environment (i.e., the local personal view of the agent from the world
that it perceives through its sensors) as well as the internal state of the agent
itself. Desires are motivational attitudes that represent the wishes of the agent.
These wishes may even be conﬂicting with each other. A consistent subset of
desires is called goals. Goals can have diﬀerent types such as achieve-goals (for
achieving a state) or maintain-goals (for maintaining a state over a period of
time). Another important component, is the set of plans. Each plan consists of
a sequence of actions for achieving a goal and can even contain subgoals. Hence,
other plans are needed to achieve the subgoals of one plan. This way, a hierarchy
of plans is formed. Moreover, intentions are those goals that the agent is currently
committed to achieve them based on its plans [6].
The BDI model is implemented in a number of MAS frameworks, namely
PRS, dMARS, JACK Intelligent AgentsTM, JAM, AgentSpeak, 3APL, Dribble,
Coo-BDI, Brahms, and Jadex. So far, BDI agents have proven to be very use-
ful in various areas such as industrial automation, simulation, air traﬃc control
systems, e-commerce systems, virtual environments, online multi-player games,
etc. Among the customers of only one of the BDI frameworks, called dMARS
(a predecessor of Jadex), are NASA (space shuttle malfunction handling),
AirServices, Thomson Airsys (air traﬃc control), Daimler Chrysler (supply chain
management, resource and logistics management) and Hazelwood Power (process
control) [9].
From the above explanation, it is clear that the BDI model ﬁts very well to the
logic of SCC applications in the IoTS. Moreover, as mentioned in Sect. 1, MASes
are intrinsically very close to the nature of the IoTS. Therefore, for our applica-
tion domain, i.e., SCC applications in the IoTS, we advocate the BDI model for
MASes. State-of-the-art BDI systems such as the free open source Jadex BDI
agents framework [6] are much more mature and advanced comparing the initial
BDI frameworks. Moreover, Jadex, which supports both stationary and mobile
agents, can be deployed on diﬀerent middleware such as JADE. JADE is a free
open source FIPA1-compliant middleware for the development and runtime exe-
cution of peer-to-peer applications based on the MAS paradigm [7]. Furthermore,
there exist an extension of JADE known as JADE-LEAP, for mobile platforms
(e.g., Android).
However, given the prevalence of highly resource-constrained things in the
IoTS, such as tiny sensor motes with only few kilobytes of memory and extremely
limited computational (i.e., CPU) as well as power (i.e., electrical energy)
resources, neither Jadex nor any other state-of-the-art BDI agent framework,
that we are aware of, could work for such limited platforms in the IoTS. In order
to address this problem, we propose three possible approaches. First, one may
tailor JADE to work atop very compact and eﬃcient virtual machines of Java-
like byte-code languages that are especially designed for motes such as the IBM
Mote Runner. Second, an existing C/C++ BDI framework such as the classic
BDI reasoner called PRS (e.g., OpenPRS) may be evolved in order to work for
this purpose. Finally, the more feasible solution is to develop a BDI framework

BDI Agents for the IoTS

from scratch, especially for SCC applications in the IoTS that works for con-
strained devices too, similar to the non-BDI Mobile-C, a mobile agent platform
for mobile C/C++ agents on constrained embedded devices, or Agila [10] and
actorNet [11] which both run on TinyOS for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)
applications.
Last but not least, one drawback of the BDI model is that its reasoning
power often comes at the cost of increased computational overhead. However,
by using the BDI model more judiciously and making correct design choices,
one can overcome this problem. For a nice practical example on this issue for
using BDI with Brahms language based on eﬃcient design choices in contrast to
ineﬃcient ones at NASA Ames Research Center, please refer to [12].

Related Work
MASes are widely used in the ﬁeld of Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks
(WSAN). ActorNet [11] is an agent-based platform with an extremely lightweight
interpreter that can operate on low-power sensor nodes with as little as 4KB
RAM. The programming language for agents is functional and very similar to the
Scheme programming language in terms of its syntax. The communication model
is based on message passing. ActorNet is speciﬁcally designed for mobile agents
on Mica2 sensor motes running TinyOS. Moreover, Agila [10] is an agent-based
middleware for mobile agents on Mica2, MicaZ, and Tmote Sky motes running
TinyOS. It has an assembly-like programming language with proprietary ISA
for agents [13].
In contrast, MAPS (Mobile Agent Platform for Sun SPOT) [14] and AFME
(Agent Factory Micro Edition) [15] are Java-based frameworks. The agent model
in the former is Finite-State-Machines (FSM), while the latter is based on
the BDI model. However, they can only run on Sun SPOT (Sun Small Pro-
grammable Object Technology), but not on the more constrained tiny sensor
motes that are much more prevalent in the IoTS.

Conclusion and Future Work
Although there exist overlapping areas in the two young research ﬁelds of the
IoTS and Multi-Agent Systems, where the latter is only about one decade older
than the former, the research and development communities are still isolated
from each other. We believe that the R&D work in the ﬁeld of the IoTS could
beneﬁt a lot from the advances in MASes. Similarly, the IoTS could become an
interesting testbed for MASes.
In this paper, we advocated Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE), in
particular Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive intelligent agents, for Sense-
Compute-Control (SCC) applications in the Internet of Things and Services
(IoTS). Considering the speciﬁc requirements and the constrained devices which
are prevalent in the IoTS, we elaborated on challenges for pursuing this aim
and proposed possible approaches for addressing them. The implementation and
validation of the proposed approaches remained as future work.

Abstract. The dramatic proliferation of information on the web and
the tremendous growth in the number of ﬁles published and uploaded
online each day have led to the appearance of new words in the Inter-
net. Due to the diﬃculty of reaching the meanings of these new terms,
which play a central role in retrieving the desired information, it becomes
necessary to give more importance to the sites and topics where these
new words appear, or rather, to give value to the words that occur fre-
quently with them. For this aim, in this paper, we propose a novel term-
term similarity score based on the co-occurrence and closeness of words
for retrieval performance improvement. A novel eﬃciency/eﬀectiveness
measure based on the principle of optimal information forager is also pro-
posed in order to assess the quality of the obtained results. Our exper-
iments were performed using the OHSUMED test collection and show
signiﬁcant eﬀectiveness enhancement over the state-of-the-art.

Introduction
The experimentation and evaluation phase is the main phase to judge the success
and failure of the implemented systems and achieved programs. The performance
and quality of a retrieval system is measured on the basis of eﬀectiveness and
eﬃciency [2]. From the theoretical standpoint, the eﬀectiveness is indicated by
returning only what user needs and eﬃciency is indicated by returning the results
to the user as quickly as possible [3,9]. From the practical standpoint the eﬀec-
tiveness, or relevance, is determined by measuring the precision, recall, etc., and
eﬃciency is determined by measuring the search time [7]. The Reliance on these
two measures varies from one community to another. The information retrieval
community, for example, is focusing too much on the quality of the top ranked
results while the artiﬁcial intelligence community, which started paying attention
to information retrieval, ontologies and the Semantic Web [16], is focusing on the
retrieval process cost. Accordingly, and in order to establish consensus between
communities and adopt both eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency measures, the Informa-
tion Foraging Theory has been proposed to do so. The information foraging is a

theory that describes information retrieval behavior [13,14]. It is derived from a
food foraging theory called optimal foraging theory that helps biologists under-
stand the factors determining an animal’s food preference and feeding strategies.
The basis of foraging theory is a cost and beneﬁt assessment of achieving a goal.
We introduce in the early part of this study the basic principles and con-
cepts of information foraging theory which is employed later in the experimental
section to evaluate the retrieval systems. The second part is devoted to present-
ing and discussing our suggested approach for improving retrieval performance.
The major purpose of this proposed approach is to provide an eﬀective similarity
measurement for query expansion based on the co-occurrence and closeness of
terms. This approach assigns importance, during the retrieval process, to words
that frequently occur in the same context. For instance, the term ‘COIOTE’ is
often recurred in the same sites where the words ‘Conference’, ‘Italy’, and ‘2014’
are clustered. the reliance on this principle was not a coincidence but was the
result of studies carried out recently regarding the evolution and growth of the
Web. All of these studies have shown an exponential growth of the Web and rapid
increase in the number of new pages created. In his study [15], Ranganathan esti-
mated that the amount of online data indexed by Google had increased from
5 exabytes in 2002 to 280 exabytes in 2009. According to [22], this amount is
expected to be double in size every 18 months. Ntoulas et al. [12] read these
statistics in terms of the number of new pages created and demonstrated that
their number is increasing by 8 % a week. The work of Bharat and Broder [1]
went further and estimated that the World Wide Web pages are growing at the
rate of 7.5 pages every second. This revolution, which the Web is witnessing, has
led to the appearance of two points:
– The ﬁrst point is the entry of new words into the Web which is estimated,
according to [21], at about one new word in every two hundred words. Studies
by [8,20] have shown that this invasion is mainly due to: neologisms, ﬁrst
occurrences of rare personal names and place names, abbreviations, acronyms,
emoticons, URLs and typographical errors.
– The second point is that the users employ these new words during the search.
Chen et al. [5] indicated in their study that more than 17 % of query words
are out of vocabulary (Non dictionary words), 45 % of them are E-speak (lol),
18 % are companies and products (Google), 16 % are proper names, 15 % are
misspellings and foreign words (womens) [19].
Out of these two points which the web is witnessing and due to the diﬃculty,
or better, the impossibility to use the meanings of these words, we proposed
a method based on ﬁnding the locations and topics where these words appear,
and then trying to use the terms which neighbor and occur with the latter in
the search process. We will use the best-known instantiation of the Probabilistic
Relevance Framework system: Okapi BM25, and the Blind Relevance Feedback:
Robertson/Sparck Jones’ term-ranking function as the baseline for comparison,
and evaluate our approach using OHSUMED test collection. The main contri-
butions of our work in this paper are the following:

– The adoption of an external correlation measure in order to evaluate the co-
occurrence of words with respect to the query features.
– The determination of an internal correlation measure in order to assess the
proximity and closeness of words relative to the terms of the query.
In the next section, we will introduce the information foraging theory. The BM25
model and the Blind Feedback approach are presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we
will explain our proposed approach and ﬁnally we will describe our experiments
and results.

Information Foraging Theory
The information foraging is a theory proposed by [14]. It is becoming a popular
theory for characterizing and understanding web browsing behavior [6]. The
theory is based on the behavior of an animal deciding what to eat, where it can
be found, the best way to obtain it and how much energy the meal will provide.
For example, imagine a predator that faces the recurrent problem of deciding
what to eat. Energy ﬂows into the environment and comes to be stored in dif-
ferent forms. Diﬀerent types of habitat and prey will yield diﬀerent amounts of
net energy. By analogy, imagine an academic researcher that faces the recurrent
problems of ﬁnding relevant information. Information ﬂows into the environment
to be represented in diﬀerent types of external media. The diﬀerent information
sources will have diﬀerent proﬁtabilities in terms of the amount of valuable infor-
mation.
The basis of foraging theory is a cost and beneﬁt assessment of achieving a
goal where cost is the amount of resources consumed when performing a chosen
activity and the beneﬁt is what is gained from engaging in that activity.
Conceptually, the optimal forager ﬁnds the best solution to the problem of
maximizing the rate of beneﬁt returned by eﬀort expended given the energetic
proﬁtabilities of diﬀerent habitats and prey, and the costs of ﬁnding and pursuing
them. By analogy, the optimal information forager ﬁnds the best solution to the
problem of maximizing the rate of valuable information gained per unit cost.
Reference [14] expressed the rate of valuable information gained per unit
cost, by the following formula:
R = G
T
(1)
where:
R, is the rate of gain of valuable information per unit cost,
G, is the ratio of the total amount of valuable information gained,
T, is the total amount of time spent.
In order to adopt both eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency measures during the experi-
mentation phase, we suggest considering the parameters G and T in representing
the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency measures, respectively.

32
I. Khennak et al.
Accordingly, we propose to evaluate and compare the quality of the results
obtained by our suggested approach relying on the principle of optimal infor-
mation forager and using the basis of the rate R, where G and T represent
respectively the total number of relevant documents returned by the retrieval
system, and the total amount of search time.

Probabilistic Relevance Framework
The probabilistic Relevance framework is a formal framework for document
retrieval which led to the development of one of the most successful text-retrieval
algorithms, Okapi BM25. The classic version of Okapi BM25 term-weighting
function, in which the weight wBM25
i
is attributed to a given term ti in a docu-
ment d, is obtained using the following formula:
wBM25
i
=
tf
k1((1 −b) + b dl
avdl) + tf
wRSJ
i
(2)
where:
tf, is the frequency of the term ti in a document d;
k1, is a constant;
b, is a constant;
dl, is the document length;
avdl, is the average of document length;
wRSJ
i
, is the well-know Robertson/Sparck Jones weight [17]:
wRSJ
i
= log (ri + 0.5)(N −R −ni + ri + 0.5)
(ni −ri + 0.5)(R −ri + 0.5)
(3)
where:
N, is the number of documents in the whole collection;
ni, is the number of documents in the collection containing ti;
R, is the number of documents judged relevant;
ri, is the number of judged relevant documents containing ti.
The RSJ weight can be used with or without relevance information. In the
absence of relevance information (the more usual scenario), the weight is reduced
to a form of classical idf:
wIDF
i
= log N −ni + 0.5
ni + 0.5
(4)
The ﬁnal BM25 term-weighting function is therefore given by:
wBM25
i
=
tf
k1((1 −b) + b dl
avdl) + tf
log N −ni + 0.5
ni + 0.5
(5)
Concerning the internal parameters, a considerable number of experiments
have been done, and suggest that in general values such as 1.2 < k1 < 2 and
www.ebook3000.com

A Novel Term-Term Similarity Score
33
0.5 < b < 0.8 are reasonably good in many cases. Robertson and Zaragoza
[18] have indicated that published versions of Okapi BM25 are based on speciﬁc
values assigned to k1 and b: k1 = 2, b = 0.5 As part of the indexing process,
an inverted ﬁle is created containing the weight wBM25
i
of each term ti in each
document d.
The similarity score between the document d and a query q is then computed
as follows:
ScoreBM25(d, q) =

ti∈q
wBM25
i
(6)
During the interrogation process, the relevant documents are selected and ranked
using this similarity score.
3.1
Blind Relevance Feedback for Query Expansion
One of the most successful techniques to improve the retrieval eﬀectiveness of
document ranking is to expand the original query with additional terms that
best capture the actual user intent. Many approaches have been proposed to
generate and extract these additional terms. The Blind Relevance Feedback
(or the Pseudo-Relevance Feedback) is one of the suggested approaches. It uses
the pseudo-relevant documents, i.e. the ﬁrst documents retrieved in response to
the initial query, to select the most important terms to be used as expansion
features.
In its simplest version, the approach starts by performing an initial search on
the original query using the BM25 term-weighting and the previous document-
scoring function (formula 6), suppose the best ranked documents to be relevant,
assign a score to each term in the top retrieved documents using a term-scoring
function, and then sort them on the basis of their scores. One of the best-
known functions for term-scoring is the Robertson/Sparck Jones term-ranking
function, deﬁned by formula 3. The original query is then expanded by adding
the top ranked terms, and re-interrogated by using the BM25 similarity score
(formula 6), in order to get more relevant results.
In addition to the BM25 Model, we will use the Robertson/Sparck Jones
term-scoring function for Relevance Feedback as a baseline to compare the results
of our proposed approach.
4
The Closeness and Co-occurrence of Terms
for Eﬀectiveness Improvement
The main goals of our proposed method is to return only the relevant documents.
For that purpose, we have introduced the concept of co-occurrence and closeness,
during the search process. This concept is based, at ﬁrst, on ﬁnding for each query
term the locations where it appears and then selecting, from these locations, the
terms which frequently neighbor and co-occur with that query term. To put it
simply, we recover for each query term the documents where it appears, and then
assess the relevance of the terms contained in these documents to the query term
on the basis of:

34
I. Khennak et al.
1. The co-occurrence, which gives value to words that appear in the largest
possible number of those documents.
2. The proximity and closeness, which gives value to words in which the distance
separating them and the query term within a document, with respect to the
number of words, is small.
These words are then ranked on the basis of their relevance to the whole query
and the top ranked ones are added to that query in order to repeat the search
process.
we started our work by reducing the search space through giving importance
to documents which contain at least two words of the initial query. This means
that the terms, which will be added to the original query, will depend only on
this set of documents. The following formula allows us to select the documents
that contain at least two words of the query, i.e. to pick out any document d
whose ScoreBigram to a query q is greater than zero:
ScoreBigram(q, d) =
i̸=j

(ti,tj)∈q
(wBM25
i
+ wBM25
j
)
(7)
As we previously mentioned, we will ﬁnd, in the ﬁrst step, the terms which
often appear together with the query terms. Finding these words is done by
assigning more importance to words that occur in the largest number of docu-
ments where each term of the query appears. We interpret this importance via
the measurement of the external distance of each term ti of the Rc’ vocabulary
to each term tj(q) of the query q (Rc, is the set of documents returned by using
the formula (7)). This distance, which does not take in consideration the content
of documents, computes the rate of appearance of ti with tj(q) in the collection
of documents Rc. In the case where ti appears in all the documents in which tj(q)
occurs, the value of the external distance will be 1.0; and in the case where ti
does not appear in any of the documents in which tj(q) occurs, the value of the
external distance will be 0.0. Based on this interpretation, the external distance
ExtDist of ti to tj(q) is calculated as follows:
ExtDist(ti, tj(q)) =

dk∈Rc
x(i,k) ∗x(j,k)

dk∈Rc
x(j,k)
(8)
where:
x(i,k) =

1 if ti ∈dk,
0 else.
dk, is a document that belongs to Rc.
The total external distance between a given term ti and the query q is estimated
as follows:
ExtDist(ti, q) =

tj(q)∈q
ExtDist(ti, tj(q))

Our dependence on this distance came as a result of the remarkable outcomes
achieved in [10,11]. The distance was used during the indexing process to com-
pute the external distance between each pair of terms of the dictionary which
appear in at least one document. After that and during the search process, the
original query was expanded by adding, for each term t of the initial query, the
term whose external distance to t is the highest.
In the second step, we will ﬁnd the terms which are often neighbors to the
query terms. Therefore, we attribute more importance to terms having a short
correlation with the query keywords. We interpret this importance via the mea-
surement of the internal correlation between each term ti of VR and each term
tj(q) of the query q. This correlation, which takes into consideration the con-
tent of documents, computes the correlation between ti and tj(q) within a given
document d in terms of the number of words separating them. The more ti is
close to tj(q), the greater is its internal correlation. For this purpose, we used the
well-known Gaussian kernel function to measure the internal correlation IntDist
between ti and tj(q) within a given document d:
IntDist(d)(ti, tj(q)) = exp
−(i −j)2
2σ2

(10)
where:
i (resp. j), is the position of the term ti (resp. tj(q)) in d;
σ, is a parameter to be tuned.
The terms ti and tj(q) may appear more than once in a document d. Therefore,
the internal distance between the term pair (ti, tj(q)) is estimated by summing all
possible IntDist(d) between ti and tj(q). Thus, the preceding formula becomes:
IntDist(d)(ti, tj(q)) =

occ(ti,tj(q))
exp
−(i −j)2
2σ2

(11)
where:
occ(ti, tj(q)), is the number of appearance of the term pair (ti, tj(q)) in the docu-
ment d.
The average internal correlation between ti and tj(q) in the whole R is then
determined as follows:
IntDist(ti, tj(q)) =

dk∈R
IntDist(dk)(ti, tj)
C(tj(q))
(12)
The following formula calculates the total internal correlation between a given
term ti and the query q :
IntDist(ti, q) =

tj(q)∈q
IntDist(ti, tj(q))
(13)

I. Khennak et al.
Finally, in order to compute the total correlation (Dist), the values of
ExtDist and IntDist were normalized between 0 and 1. The overall correla-
tion between ti and q is obtained using the following formula:
Dist(ti, q) = λExtDist(ti, q) + (1 −λ)IntDist(ti, q)
(14)
where:
λ, is a parameter to adjust the balance between the external and internal corre-
lations (λ ∈[0, 1]).
Using formula (14), we evaluate the relevance of each term t ∈VR with respect
to the query q. Then we rank the terms on the basis of their relevance and add
the top ranked ones to the original query q. Based on the BM25 similarity score,
presented in Sect. 3, we retrieve the relevant documents, as follows:
ScoreBM25(d, q′) =

ti∈q′
wBM25
i
∗β
(15)
where:
q′, is the expanded query;
β =

1 if ti ∈q,
Dist(ti, q) else.

Experiments
In order to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out
a set of experiments. First, we describe the dataset, the software, and the eﬀec-
tiveness measures used. Then, we present the experimental results.
5.1
Dataset
Extensive experiments were performed on OHSUMED test collection. The col-
lection consists of 348 566 references from MEDLINE, the on-line medical infor-
mation database, consisting of titles and/or abstracts from 270 medical journals
over a ﬁve-year period (1987-1991). In addition, the OHSUMED collection con-
tains a set of queries, and relevance judgments (a list of which documents are
relevant to each query).
In order that the results be more accurate and credible, we divided the
OHSUMED collection into 6 sub-collections. Each sub-collection has been
deﬁned by a set of documents, queries, and a list of relevance documents. Table 1
summarizes the characteristics of each sub-collection in terms of the number of
documents it contains, the size of the sub-collection, and the number of terms
in the vocabulary (dictionary).
Regarding the queries, the OHSUMED collection includes 106 queries. Each
query is accompanied by a set of relevance judgments chosen from the whole
collection of documents. Partitioning the collection of documents into sub-
collections leads inevitably to a decrease in the number of relevant documents

for each query. In other words, if we have n documents relevant to a given query
q with respect to the entire collection, then surely we will have m documents
relevant to the same query with respect to one of the sub-collections, where the
value of n is certainly greater or equal to the value of m and, the probability of
non-existence of any relevant document for a given query could be possible. In
this case, in which the value of m is equal to 0, we have removed, for each sub-
collection c, every query does not include any relevant document in c. Table 2
shows the number of queries (Nb Queries) for each sub-collection, the average
query length in terms of number of words (Avr Query Len), the average number
of relevant documents (Avr Rel Doc).

Software, Eﬀectiveness Measures
The BM25 model, the Relevance Feedback technique presented in Sect. 3, and the
proposed approach have been implemented in Python. All the experiments have
been performed on a Sony-Vaio workstation having an Intel i3-2330M/2.20GHz
processor, 4GB RAM and running Ubuntu GNU/Linux 12.04. The precision and
the Mean Average Precision (MAP) have been used as measures to evaluate the
eﬀectiveness of the systems and to compare the diﬀerent approaches. As indi-
cated is Sect. 2, the principle of optimal information forager has been employed
to assess the performance of the search methods.
5.3
Results
Before proceeding to compare the quality of the suggested approach with the
BM25 and the Pseudo-Relevance Feedback methods, we ﬁxed the parameter σ of
the internal correlation (formula (10)). For this aim, we considered the internal
correlation as the total correlation (Dist), i.e. λ = 0, and systematically tested a
set of ﬁxed σ values from 1 to 40 in increments of 5. Table 3 presents the precision

values after retrieving 10 documents (P@10) and the Mean Average Precision
(MAP) reached by the proposed approach, while using the sub-collection of
50000 documents. The number of pseudo-relevant documents (denoted by PSD)
was tuned at 10, 20 and 50.
From Table 3, we can conclude that the appropriate values of σ, which bring
the best performance, are 5 and 10.
For all the following experiments, the parameters σ and λ were set to 5 and
0.5, respectively. Moreover, the number of expansion terms added to the initial
query for the proposed system and the Pseudo-Relevance Feedback approaches
was set to 10, which is a typical choice [4].
In the ﬁrst stage of testing, we evaluated and compared the results of the
suggested approach (EXT/INT), which use both the external and internal cor-
relations, with those of BM25 and RSJ (Robertson/Sparck Jones algorithm for
Relevance Feedback); where we computed the precision values after retrieving
10 documents (P@10). Figure 1 shows the precision values for the EXT/INT,
the BM25 and the RSJ techniques.
In the second stage of testing, we computed the Mean Average Precision
(MAP) score to evaluate the retrieval performance of the EXT/INT, the BM25,
and the Relevance Feedback method.
From Fig. 1a and b, we note an obvious superiority of the suggested approach
EXT/INT compared with the BM25, and this superiority was more signiﬁcant in
comparison to the RSJ technique. Despite the superiority shown in Fig. 1c, the
result was not similar to that observed in Fig. 1a and b, however, the precision
values of the proposed approach were the best in all the sub-collections.
Through Fig. 1 we can conclude that the proposed method EXT/INT, com-
pared with the rest of the search techniques, succeeded to improve the ranking of
the relevant documents and made them in the ﬁrst place. The precision values of
the suggested system, after retrieving 10 documents, show a clear and signiﬁcant
superiority in front of each of BM25 and RSJ techniques, and this conﬁrms the
eﬀectiveness of the EXT/INT approach.

Figure 2 shows a clear advantage of the EXT/INT approach compared to the
RSJ in all the sub-collections. It also shows a slight superiority over the BM25
results.
As previously explained in Sect. 2, we propose to use the principle of optimal
information forager in order to adopt both eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency measures
in evaluating the quality of the obtained results. For this purpose, we calculate
for each query the rate R, illustrated in formula 1, where the parameter G was
taken as the number of relevant documents retrieved and the parameter T as
the total amount of search time. The diﬀerent rates, each of which is linked to a
query, are then summed and divided by the total number of queries. As a result,
we obtain an average rate R(Q) deﬁned as follows:
R(Q) =
1
|Q|
|Q|

i=1
Gqi
Tqi
(16)
where:
|Q|, is the total number of queries,
Gqi, is the number of relevant documents retrieved for query qi,
Tqi, is the total time spent in processing qi.

It can be seen from Table 4 that the BM25 overcame the EXT/INT approach
in terms of R(Q) values. This superiority is mainly due to the short time taken
by BM25 during the search process as it used only the original query words.
However, it is clear that the proposed method produces the best results over the
RSJ in all cases.
6
Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel term-term similarity score based on the co-
occurrence and closeness of words for retrieval performance improvement. We
have introduced in this work, the concept of the External/Internal similarity of
terms.
We thoroughly tested our approach using the OHSUMED test collection.
The experimental results show that the proposed approach EXT/INT achieved
a signiﬁcant improvement in eﬀectiveness.
Although the main purpose of relying on the principle of optimal information
forager, and in particular the R(Q) Score, in assessing the quality of retrieval
systems was not to get better results compared to BM25 and RSJ methods,
but rather to introduce a new measure in order to compare the performance of
retrieval systems, taking into account both eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency measures.
Even though our methods perform quite well, there are some remaining issues
that need to be investigated further. One limitation of this work is the use of
a single test collection. The other one is that the semantic aspect of terms was
not exploited in order to improve the search eﬀectiveness.

Abstract. The Internet-of-Things (IoT) connects devices with embedded sensors
to the Internet and is expected to grow at a spectacular rate. IoT will drive increased
quality of life for individual as well as spur business growth and efﬁciency gains in
industry. Actions based on real-time information, better decision making and
remote diagnostics are some key areas where IoT can make a difference. This
paper presents a smart agent architecture for the Internet-of-Things based on
Bayesian Network technology that can be used for automation, notiﬁcation,
diagnostics and troubleshooting use cases.

Introduction
The Internet-of-Things provides us with lots of sensor data. However, the data by
themselves do not provide value unless we can turn them into actionable, contextu-
alized information. Big data and data visualization techniques allow us to gain new
insights by batch-processing and off-line analysis of sensor data. Real-time sensor data
analysis and decision-making is often done manually but to make it scalable, it is
preferably automated. Artiﬁcial Intelligence provides us the framework and tools to go
beyond trivial real-time decision and automation use cases for IoT.
In this paper, we present a cloud-based smart agent architecture for real-time
decision taking in IoT applications. Section 2 reviews the concept of a rational agent.
Section 3 describes the architecture of an agent suited for IoT applications. Section 4
explains why Bayesian technology is a good choice as agent logic for IoT applications.
Section 5 explains how the agent can be embedded in an overall IoT solution. Finally,
Sect. 6 summarizes and concludes the paper.

Rational Agent
The rational agent is a central concept in artiﬁcial intelligence [1]. An agent is
something that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that envi-
ronment via actuators. For example, a robot may rely on cameras as sensors and act on
its environment via motors.

A rational agent is an agent that does ‘the right thing’. The right thing obviously
depends on the performance criterion set for the agent, but also on an agent’s prior
knowledge of the environment, the sequence of observations the agent has made in the
past and the choice of actions that an agent can perform (Fig. 1).
An agent consists of an architecture and logic. The architecture of an agent typi-
cally consists of a computing device with physical sensors and actuators. The archi-
tecture allows ingesting sensor data, running logic on the data and acting upon the
outcome. The logic itself is the heart of the agent and is the agent program that maps
percepts of the environment to actions on that environment. It computes and reasons
based on the available data and its knowledge of the environment.

Agent Architecture for IoT Applications
As described above, an agent is composed of an architecture and logic. Each poses
speciﬁc challenges in the context of IoT. This section describes architectural consid-
erations for the smart agent. Section 4 discusses the choice of logic.
3.1
Agent Location
In an IoT context, the agent can be located at different places:
• Close to the sensors and actuators, e.g. on a home gateway, a smartphone or on on-
site server or private cloud infrastructure in an industrial environment.
• In a (public) cloud.
• Somewhere in between, such as switches and routers at the network edge. For the
latter, Cisco coined the term fog computing [2].

A Cloud-Based Bayesian Smart Agent Architecture
43

In many respects, a cloud-based architecture is the preferred solution for a smart
agent.
A cloud solution is device-agnostic and decouples logic from the presentation layer.
So whether logic gets presented on an Android Smartphone, an iPhone, a tablet or as a
web app (or any combination of the above), the cloud logic only needs to be developed
once and can be used to target all of the above devices. By decoupling the user
interface (view) from the logic (model and control), an architectural model arises where
logic is built once together with a REST API. It can be changed and updated without
necessarily impacting any end-user device software. This model reduces development
time and increases business agility. Furthermore, the cloud brings many well-known
advantages in terms of software maintenance, upgrades, roll-backs, etc.
Cloud logic scales well: cloud-capacity scales horizontally, while distributed HW
often needs to be swapped when HW resources are no longer sufﬁcient. In that sense,
cloud logic is also more future-proof.
Cloud capacity is a shared resource and hence per-customer costs are substantially
lower than for equivalent distributed HW capabilities. This can make a big difference in
market segments that are CAPEX-sensitive. Solutions that rely primarily on cloud may
be better suited towards a subscription model with smaller initial CAPEX investment
for customers. Gateways are usually considered to be price-sensitive.
In case sensor information is combined with information from the Internet such as
social media data, weather forecast, generic API information, or user proﬁle infor-
mation (which is by deﬁnition not bound to any particular device), the cloud is the
natural place for these things to come together.
Similarly when integrating multiple IoT vertical solutions, e.g. the integration of an
alarm system from vendor A with a home automation system of vendor B, that inte-
gration is likely to happen via APIs exposed in the back-end, rather than via direct
integration between devices in the home. Using battery-powered devices to retrieve all
this information from the cloud for local execution of the logic may drain battery
resources.
Finally, cloud intelligence also allows easy generation of analytics regarding the
usage of the logic itself. Which rules ﬁred and why? How often?
However, in some application domains a cloud-based model is not optimal. In some
cases, bandwidth is expensive or the amount of data is so large that connectivity and
bandwidth are the bottleneck, i.e. data does not get easily into the cloud. You can think of
applications relying on camera video feeds or certain industrial applications, e.g. Virgin
Atlantic reported that Boeing 787 s will create half a terabyte of data per ﬂight [3].
In those cases, local, on-premise processing or preprocessing, compression or
buffering of data conserves bandwidth and associated costs. In a multi-tiered archi-
tecture, local preprocessing complements core logic that still resides in the cloud.
In other use cases, availability and latency are crucial aspects of a service, e.g. in
process control in industry. For time-critical applications that require response times in
the order of milliseconds, cloud-based logic can be replaced by fog or onsite logic.
In sum, there are compelling arguments for a cloud-based architecture but some
verticals have boundary conditions that do not allow doing that.

Software-Deﬁned Sensors and Actuators
Besides the location of the agent, the agent architecture also speciﬁes how the agent
interacts with sensors and actuators in its environment. In the context of IoT, appli-
cations can beneﬁt from enriching sensor data with other types of information such as
location, social media data, wearables, big data, open data, data from the API economy
etc. The usage of additional sources of information leads to increased precision, per-
sonalization and contextualization of IoT applications, see e.g. [4].
Therefore, a smart agent architecture requires a generalized sensor and actuator
concept that allows not only accepting raw sensor data but also other types of information.
We call this concept a ‘software-deﬁned-sensor’ and ‘software-deﬁned-actuators’.
4
Rational Agent Logic for IoT
The choice for a particular type of agent logic is inﬂuenced by the characteristics of the
environment in which an agent needs to operate [1].
The simplest agent relies on ‘if-then-else’ constructs that are available in any
programming language or rules engine. These agent implementations belong to the
class of simple reﬂex agents. Their advantage is simplicity and familiarity; the main
drawback is that they are only applicable if the action to be taken depends only on the
current observation.
A second option is ﬂowchart models such as used in business process modeling
systems. These agents belong to the class of model-based reﬂex agents. They can
maintain state of past observations, but can become very complex when the number of
inputs and states rises. Moreover, when uncertainty is involved, ﬂowchart based
models may not come to satisfactory conclusions.
A third option is to use graph modeling technology, such as Bayesian networks,
which is an implementation of goal- or utility-based agents. Below we illustrate why
Bayesian networks match IoT environment characteristics.
Bayesian logic is the technology of choice when working in environments that
cannot be completely observed, i.e. when not all aspects that could impact a choice of
action are observable. In IoT, due to the complexity of the environment or due to cost
constraints on the number of sensors, the environment may not be fully observable.
Bayesian logic is suited for applications with unreliable, noisy or incomplete data
or when domain knowledge is incomplete such that probabilistic reasoning is required.
In IoT, sensors may not be responding, out-of-service or quality of sensor data may be
low or inaccurate. In all these cases, Bayesian technology is the best choice.
Bayesian logic is suited for use cases where the number of causes for a particular
observation is so large, that it is nearly impossible to enumerate them explicitly. For
example, when a door pressure sensor observes that a door is open, somebody may
have forgotten to close the door, somebody may still be standing at the door while
having a conversation, somebody may have brieﬂy left open the door but will return
soon, etc. Bayesian networks allow you to pick the most relevant options and model all
others as ‘other causes’ via so-called leaky nodes.

45

Bayesian networks are well suited to model expert-knowledge together with
knowledge that is retrieved from accumulated data [5]. In a data-driven approach,
humans can specify the main attributes of Bayesian logic while the exact (conditional)
probabilities can be learned in an automatic way from the available data.
From an implementation perspective, Bayesian networks allow more compact
modelling in case the number of variables and states rises. The modeling of the logic
and as-well-as the ongoing maintenance and updates to the logic will be simpler than
for alternative technologies.
Finally, Bayesian networks are more amenable to use cases where there are
asynchronous information ﬂows, i.e. when not all information streams are synchro-
nized, since the inference (i.e. the computation of posterior probability given obser-
vations on other variables) can be executed as new evidence comes in, for any node. As
noted above, contextualized IoT applications will require the combination of many
input sources, and therefore Bayesian networks may also be a good choice.
A couple of authors have suggested the usage of Bayesian Network technology as a
valuable technology for IoT [6–10], however without implementation architecture as
deﬁned in this paper.
5
Embedding the Smart Agent in an IoT Solution
In many cases, the Bayesian logic will form part of a larger IoT application that has
other components such as dedicated user interfaces, device management, big data
analysis etc. Therefore, it is required that the Bayesian logic can be integrated in an
overall solution. This can be done by exposing the architecture as a REST service,
which means the agent, sensors and actuators can be controlled from the outside, and
the intelligent agent can be integrated as part of a bigger solution. Figure 2 summarizes
the cloud-based smart agent architecture proposed in this paper.

Conclusion
This paper has presented a smart agent architecture for real-time decision making in
IoT applications. It is based on a cloud architecture with ﬂexible, generalized sensor
and actuator capabilities via a software-deﬁned-sensor and software-deﬁned-actuator
layer. At its core it uses Bayesian network technology. This paper has demonstrated
that Bayesian technology matches challenges and environmental conditions of IoT. Its
API-driven architecture makes it compatible with modern SaaS development practices
and allows integration in broader IoT solutions.

Abstract. A condensation phenomenon occurs when the water vapor in the air
turn into water droplets. Many industrial facilities are damaged by the con-
densation phenomenon. An ammunition storage is one of the facilities that are
damaged by this phenomenon. Therefore, this paper proposes an IoT-based
intelligent condition management system (ICMS) in for the industrial facilities.
The proposed system prevents a condensation phenomenon by measuring the
temperature and humidity and provides alerting service about intrusion and gas
exposure through a smartphone application. Therefore, it has become possible to
manage the ammunition efﬁciently.

Introduction
A condensation phenomenon is easily shown in our daily lives. This phenomenon is
caused by difference between internal temperature and external temperature. Generally,
when the air temperature gets high, the amount of saturated water vapor is increased.
However, if warm air suddenly becomes cold, the amount of saturated water vapor is
also reduced [1]. For this reason, water vapor changes to water droplets. The con-
densation phenomenon easily occurs during the summer when temperature and
humidity are especially high. This phenomenon causes a lot of problems. For example,
water droplets corrode metals and woods and promote the growth of mold. The army
ammunition storage facility is also one of the facilities damaged by condensation.
Because most ammunition is expensive, scale of damage is greater than the other
problems. Therefore, many studies have been conducted in order to prevent this
problem. However, most studies have presented a solution of the problem with
architectural approaches. And, this solution can only be applicable to the initial con-
struction of ammunition storage and requires high cost. Currently, most of ammunition
storages were built in the form of igloo for the purpose of protection and camouﬂage.
The igloo type ammunition storage has bad air circulation between inside and outside.

Thus, it is particularly vulnerable to condensation. Nowadays, in order to prevent the
condensation phenomenon, an administrator opens the door of ammunition storage and
directly checks the value of temperature hygrometer which is installed internally. If it is
the condensation conditions, the administrator should turn on the fan using the internal
switch of ammunition storage. This management system is an inconvenient for man-
aging temperature and humidity.
Recently, with the changes in the IoT paradigm, many studies on IoT based tem-
perature and humidity monitoring system have been conducted [2, 3]. Devices shown in
these studies consist of a sensor module, a communication module, and a micro con-
troller unit (MCU). The sensor module measures ambient temperature and humidity.
The communication module sends the information, which is collected through the
sensor module, to users via WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee communication. The MCU ana-
lyzes the information of temperature and humidity and creates services for the users. By
controlling the appliances in the room through this monitoring system, user can be
provided optimal air control service in the space [4]. However, these studies have mostly
focused on home and building as application target areas.
Therefore, this paper proposes an IoT-based intelligent condition management
system (ICMS) for the industrial facilities. The ICMS measures the temperature and
humidity and determines whether the condition phenomenon occurred based on these
collected information. If it is condensation condition, ICMS turns on the fan installed
inside the ammunition storage. The operating fan reduces the difference between
internal temperature and external temperature by letting outside air in. This method is
capable of automatically preventing condensation according to the condition of the
ammunition storage and improves the conventional method which has been managed
manually. The ICMS also includes a motion sensor and a gas sensor. Therefore, if an
intruder enters the ammunition storage or gas is detected in the space, an administrator
can be provided alerting service through a smartphone application.
2
System Architecture
The architecture of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 1. The ICMS is installed in
each of the ammunition storages. It collects the information of temperature, humidity,
movement, and gas in the internal ammunition storage. A server is located in the center
of ammunition storages. It plays a role in storing the information which has been
measured by the ICMS and transmitting these information to administrator. The ICMSs
adjacent to the server are named header node, the others are named general node. The
general nodes transmit the measured information to header nodes. And, the header
nodes transmit these information to the server. This method helps to prevent server
overload. The ICMS and server are connected via ZigBee communication, and the
server is connected to administrator’s smartphone via military’s intranet. The two key
functions that the proposed system has are as follows.
2.1
Preventing the Condensation Using an ICMS
Figure 2 describes the process of preventing the condensation phenomenon in the
proposed system. The possibility that the condensation will occur is deeply related to
Design and Implementation of IoT-Based Intelligent Condition
49

the difference between indoor and outdoor temperature. Thus, in this Fig. 2, the high
possibility that the condensation will occur means the temperature difference between
indoor and outdoor ammunition storage is over one degree or the humidity is over
80 %. Moreover, ICMS has an ability to control the fan by comparing the internal and
external temperature information collected from the sensor manager. The process of the
comparison process is performed by the sensing data manager in ICMS. In the sce-
nario 1, when ICMS detects a high possibility that the condensation will occur, the
network manager of ICMS forwards a control packet to the fan and an information
packet to the server. Then, the fan is activated by the relay controller and the server
Fig. 1. Overview of the proposed system architecture.
Fig. 2. Sequence diagram for preventing the condensation using an ICMS.
50

stores the information packet. After storing the information of ICMS, the server sends
the information packet to the smart phone. Similarly, when ICMS does not detect the
high possibility that the condensation will occur, ICMS forwards a control packet to the
fan and an information packet to the server. After receiving the control packet, the fan
is deactivated and the server stores the information of ICMS. Then, the server transfers
the information packet to the smart phone.
In Fig. 2, the exceptional situation means that the environmental condition has not
be improved for 1 h after the fan is turned on. For example, the exceptional situation is
can occur due to the fan’s breakdown. If ICMS detects the exceptional situation, ICMS
will transfer the control packet to the fan again and the warning packet to the server.
Then, the server stores the information of ICMS and sends the warning packet to the
smart phone. After the smart phone receives the warning packet, the smart phone shows
a pop-up message that alarms the administrator through the mobile phone application.
Due to this pop-up message, the administrator can immediately recognize the problem of
the ammunition and quickly handle the problem.
Furthermore, the administrator is able to remotely control the power supply of fan
by using the smart phone. The scenario 2 in Fig. 1 shows the process of the remote
control. When an administrator sends a control packet to the ICMS through the server,
the authority manager of ICMS ﬁrst identiﬁes the administrator for the security, and
then the control packet is sent to the fan. For this purpose, the authority manager has an
ability to entitle speciﬁc administrators to access the ICMS. If an administrator has
access authority, ICMS will forward the control packet to the fan to activate or
deactivate the fan. After the fan is turned on or off, the ICMS sends an information
packet to the server. Then, the server stores the information of ICMS and transfers the
information packet to the administrator’s smart phone.
2.2
Providing an Alerting Service Through Smartphone Application
Figure 3 describes the process of warning the administrator of an intruder’s movement
or a gas leak in the ammunition storage. When ICMS detects the motion of human or
gas exposure, ICMS forwards a warning packet to the server. The server, then, stores
the information of ICMS and transfers the warning packet to the smart phone. After
receiving the warning packet, the smart phone immediately warns the administrator of
detecting the motion of a human or a gas leak with a pop-up message of the mobile
phone application.
3
Implementation and Test
Figure 4(a) shows the prototype of ICMS. It consists of a micro controller unit (MCU),
a power module, an environmental monitoring sensor module, a ZigBee (IEEE
802.15.4) module, and a buzzer. The environmental monitoring sensor module is
divided into 3 parts: a temperature and humidity sensor, a gas sensor, and a motion
sensor. A smartphone application is shown in Fig. 4(b). Using the mobile application,
an administrator is able to both observe the condition of the ammunition storage and
Design and Implementation of IoT-Based Intelligent Condition
51

remotely control the fan to decrease a gap between indoor temperature and outdoor
temperature. Moreover, the mobile application displays pop-up messages and warns an
administrator of urgent problems such as detecting an intruder and the air condition that
has not been improved for 1 h. We implemented the proposed system in the test bed
shown in Fig. 4(c). It was made as a model analogous to the environment of an
ammunition storage. The test bed consists of ICMS, an external thermometer, and a
fan. Figure 4(d) shows temperature changes in the test bed. When the temperature
difference became over one degree between inside and outside, the fan was activated.

And then, the temperature difference was decreased. Owing to this process of the
proposed system, the condensation phenomenon could be prevented.

Conclusion
For the efﬁcient ammunition storage management, an intelligent condition management
system (ICMS) is proposed. The ICMS measures temperature and humidity in real time
and turns on an installed fan by analyzing these measured values. Therefore, it prevents
condensation phenomenon automatically. The ICMS also provides alerting service for
security and safety. An administrator can receive the message about intrusion or gas
exposure via smartphone application. We implemented the proposed system in a test
bed to verify efﬁciency. The proposed system prevented the condensation phenomenon
by controlling a fan.

Abstract. The Robotic Ecology vision shares many similarities with
the one pursued by the IoT community: The ideal aim on both fronts is
that arbitrary combinations of devices should be able to be deployed in
unstructured environments, such as those exempliﬁed in a typical house-
hold, and there eﬃciently cooperate to the achievement of complex tasks.
While this has the potential to deliver a range of modular and disrup-
tive applications, a pressing and open research question is how to reduce
the amount of pre-programming required for their deployment in real
world applications. In order to inspire similar advancements within the
IoT community, this extended abstract discusses how this goal has been
addressed by pioneering the concept of a self-learning robotic ecology
within the EU project RUBICON (Robotic UBIquitous Cognitive Net-
work); how such an approach relates to the concept of Aﬀordances at
the basis of Gibsons’ theory of ecological psychology; and how it can be
used to drive the gradual adaptation of a robotic ecology to changing
contexts and evolving requirements.

Robotic Ecologies
In [1], Saﬃotti and Broxvall discuss the implications of their PEIS-Ecology
instantiation of the Robotic Ecology approach from an ecological (Gibsonian)
point of view, by conceiving the interaction between each device and its envi-
ronment in terms of mutuality and reciprocity. An ecology of simple devices can
achieve complex tasks by performing several steps in a coordinated fashion while
also exchanging sensor data and other useful information in the process. Note
how such a viewpoint falls into the framing assumption of ecological psychology,
which, as Greeno notes [2] “. . . involves a shift of the level of primary focus of
cognitive analysis from processes that can be attributed to individual agents to
interactive processes in which agents participate, cooperatively, with other agents
and with their physical systems that they interact with”.
Saﬃotti and Broxvall emphasise how its embodied nature is what makes
confronting an ecological view in a robotic ecology characteristically diﬀerent
from what is usually done in pure software systems, e.g., for the orchestration

of web-services. Noticeably, the semantic of services (the function that they can
provide) is usually advertised to the network irrespective of the components that
may actually come to use them. On the contrary, just as with Aﬀordances [3],
intended as behavioural possibilities, a robotic ecology must be described in
terms of relations (conﬁgurations) between its components. For instance, a ceil-
ing camera can track and inform a mobile robot about its location in the envi-
ronment (thus aﬀording localization to the robot). However, this can be done as
long as the robot in question (i) is not too small, (ii) is inside the ﬁeld of view
of the camera, and (iii) its color can be distinguished from the one of the ﬂoor.
A PEIS Ecology adopts temporal constraints to represent the possible rela-
tions between PEIS components, e.g., stating that navigation must occur while
location information is available, or that a class of robots is able to push a given
object. These relations are then shared and resolved into global conﬁgurations,
by using either a centralized constraint satisfaction solver or a multi-agent, reac-
tive approach. However, both methods lack learning capabilities and rely instead
on pre-programmed, static and brittle domain knowledge. The inability of mod-
elling other (unforeseen at design time) information in the domain, including
possible synergies, conﬂicts and other inter-dependencies between their many
components, is what breaks the modularity of the development of these systems,
and ultimately impacts on their ability to pro-actively and smoothly adapt to
changing contexts and evolving requirements. These are the key issues addressed
in RUBICON [4], as outlined in the next section.
2
The RUBICON Approach
The most appealing aspects of the concept of aﬀordances as a source of inspi-
ration in Robotics are (i) its implicit emphasis on the relationship between an
agent and the environment, and (ii) its grounding in the paradigm of direct per-
ception. The central question for Gibson was whether aﬀordances can be directly
perceived. In their stride to build physically embodied agents, roboticists have
thus sought to enable robots with the ability to learn to recognize aﬀordances,
thus ultimately reducing the complexity of representation and reasoning.
A common approach has been the utilization of an exploratory stage, in
which the robot tries out diﬀerent action primitives and observes their conse-
quences. To this end, roboticists have usually based their works on more formal,
e.g., functional elaboration of aﬀordances seen as opportunities for action and
inherently suited to be used as pre-conditions in a planning context by virtue of
their predictive quality (see [5] for a survey). A service robot may thus learn how
to poke, push, pull, rotate and lift objects, and also for what objects and in what
situations its actions can more successfully achieve given results. A mobile robot
may learn to infer the traversability of its surroundings by mapping from the
space of the features extracted from its range sensors, to the eﬀects (success/fail)
of a number of basic manoeuvres. Techniques supporting online learning usually
exploit curiosity measures to guide the robot’s exploration process, by reducing
unnecessary interaction with the environment when the robot is conﬁdent that
it will not bring about new information.

Equipping robotic ecologies with similar learning abilities poses a formidable
number of issues: from the computational constraints and the number of the
devices involved, to the diﬃculty of identifying suitable and reliable teaching
information to drive system’s adaptation. RUBICON [4] addressed these prob-
lems by supporting a self-sustaining dynamic between cognitive capabilities real-
ized in a modular architecture, shown in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1. High-level, hierarchical RUBICON architecture: Sensor data is processed as
much as possible locally on computational constrained and robotic devices. Information
is extracted and exploited by the higher layers.
The central component of the RUBICON architecture is a plan-based Control
Layer (an evolution of the system employed in PEIS, as described in Sect. 1),
which is able to decide which components (e.g. robot behaviours) and/or devices
need to collaborate to achieve given service goals. The key approach to enabling
system adaptation is to (i) improve its ability to extract meaning from noisy
and imprecise sensed data, and (ii) learn what goals to pursue, and (iii) how
to pursue them, from experience, rather than by relying on pre-programmed
goal-deliberation strategies and plan pre-conditions.
The ﬁrst and the last of these challenges are met by the Learning Layer, a
distributed and adaptable learning infrastructure based on echo state networks,
and which is used to process time series of data gathered by the sensors in the
ecology. Its outputs are used to recognize events concerning the state of the
environment and of the users, and predict the success/fail rate in using given
devices and/or other components in the ecology. This information is used by the
Control Layer to inform its conﬁguration of the ecology. The second challenge
is the responsibility of the Cognitive Layer, which uses Self-Organising Fuzzy
Neural Networks to reason over the events recognized by the Learning Layer in
order to predict the user’s activation of appliances and robotic services.
In our reports [4], we have described how our system, equipped with some
initial knowledge and supervised information, can be trained to provide some
basic services. The system can use this as a starting point and self-adapt to

57
the preferences of the user and to modiﬁcation to the environment in a number
of ways: ﬁrstly, the Cognitive Layer can learn to predict the user’s routines.
For instance, by observing past instances in which the user has summoned her
cleaner robot to the kitchen after eating her meal, the system learns to send the
robot without waiting for the user’s request. Secondly, the Control Layer can
monitor the performances and the outcomes of its own plans, and feed them
(as teaching signals) to the Learning Layer in order to learn previously un-
modelled plan pre-conditions. For instance, in [6], we have shown how a robot
can learn to use the information it receives from itw own sensors and the sensors
embedded in the environment (e.g. infrared sensors signalling the movements of
the user and/or the robot) to predict (i) what are the best situations in which
cleaning a certain room will be less likely to annoy the user, and (ii) when is best
to use the RFID-based localization component in place of its own laser (e.g.,
after the user installs a new mirror that disturbs the robot’s laser). Finally,
the Cognitive Layer can “explore” (in a manner similar to the one adopted
in curiosity-driven, robot manipulators) by trying out new goals in diﬀerent
situations in order to gather further experience and/or feedback from the user.
Our approach allows robotic ecologies to be driven by easily identiﬁable
(albeit rough) rules, while delegating, over time, symbolic reasoning to data-
driven inference for the purpose of learning to recognize the aﬀordances of their
environment, directly from sensor features. This is a clear improvement over
past solutions, which demanded for all goal rules and plan pre-conditions to be
speciﬁed a priori. What makes it a practical approach, which limits the com-
putational cost of our learning solutions and enables us to use fully automatic
feature selection algorithms, is (i) the existence of a ﬁnite set of pre-deﬁned
and simple goals, (ii) their clear distinction to the plans to achieve them, and
(iii) the reduced number of sensor sources included in current smart homes.
Future research should increase the scalability of these systems, and address the
challenging problem of autonomously learning what goals are achievable to the
ecology.

Abstract. While the vision of Internet of Things (IoT) is rather
inspiring, its practical implementation remains challenging. Conven-
tional programming approaches prove unsuitable to provide IoT resource
constrained devices with the distributed processing capabilities required
to implement intelligent, autonomic, and self-organizing behaviors. In our
previous work, we had already proposed an alternative programming
methodology for such systems that is characterized by high-level pro-
gramming and symbolic expressions evaluation, and developed a light-
weight middleware to support it. Our approach allows for interactive
programming of deployed nodes, and it is based on the simple but eﬀec-
tive paradigm of executable code exchange among nodes. In this paper,
we show how our methodology can be used to provide IoT resource con-
strained devices with reasoning abilities by implementing a Fuzzy Logic
symbolic extension on deployed nodes at runtime.

Introduction
According to the Internet of Thing (IoT) vision [1], all kinds of devices, although
computationally limited, might be used to interact with people or to man-
age information concerning the individuals themselves [6]. Besides reactive
responses on input changes, the whole network may exhibit more advanced
behaviors resulting from reasoning processes carried out on the individual nodes
or emerging from local interactions. However, nodes’ constraints leave the system
designers many challenges to face, especially when distributed applications are
considered [9]. Conventional programming methodologies often prove inappro-
priate on resource constrained IoT devices, especially when knowledge must be
treated with a high level representation or changes of the application goals may
be required after the network has been deployed [8]. Moreover, the implemen-
tation of intelligent mechanisms, as well as symbolic reasoning, through rigid

layered architectures, reveals impracticable on resource constrained devices such
as those commonly used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Often this issue is
faced through the adoption of an intelligent centralized system that uses WSNs as
static sensory tools [3]. Indeed, integration of WSN devices in the IoT seems quite
natural and desirable, provided that the aforementioned issues be addressed. In
our previous work [4,5], we introduced an alternative programming methodol-
ogy, along with a lightweight middleware, based on high-level programming and
executable code exchange among WSN nodes. The contribution of this paper
consists in the extension of the methodology to include symbolic reasoning even
on IoT resource constrained devices. The remainder of the paper is organized
as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the key concepts of our methodology and the
symbolic model we adopted. In Sect. 3, we extend the symbolic approach charac-
terizing our programming environment with Fuzzy Logic, and in Sect. 4 we show
an application to make the nodes reason about their position with respect to
thermal zones of the deployment area. Finally, Sect. 5 reports our conclusions.

Key Concepts of the Development Methodology
Mainstream praxis to program embedded devices consists in cross-compilation of
specialized application code together with a general purpose operating system.
The resulting object code is then uploaded to the on-board permanent stor-
age. Instead, our methodology is based on high-level executable code exchange
between nodes. This mechanism, while abstracted, is implemented at a very low
level avoiding the burden of a complex and thick software layer between the
hardware and the application code. Indeed, a Forth environment runs on the
hardware providing the core functionalities of an operating system, including
a command line interface (CLI). This also allows for interactive development,
which is a peculiar feature of our methodology that can be used even to repro-
gram deployed nodes. This way, nodes can be made expand their capabilities by
exchanging pieces of code among themselves in realtime. The CLI is accessible
through either a microcontroller’s UART or the on-board radio [4]. The Forth
environment is inherently provided with an interpreter and a compiler. Both can
be easily extended by deﬁning new words stored in the dictionary. Being Forth a
stack-based language, words use the stack for parameters passing. A command,
or an entire program, is thus just a sequence words. The description of a task
in natural language and its implementation can be thus made very similar. Our
programming environment is composed of some nodes wirelessly deployed and a
wired node that behaves as a bridge to send user inputs to the network. In previ-
ous work [5], we introduced the syntactic construct that implements executable
code exchange among nodes:
tell: ⟨code⟩:tell
in which ⟨code⟩is a sequence of words, sent as character strings, to be remotely
interpreted by the receiver node. The address of the destination node is left
on the top of the stack. A numeric as well as a string value, can be taken at

60
S. Gaglio et al.
runtime from the top of the stack and inserted in the outgoing packet when
special markers, such as ∼for numbers and ∼s for strings are encountered.
3
Distributed Processing and Symbolic Reasoning
In our programming environment, purely reactive behaviors can be easily imple-
mented on the remote nodes by sending them the sequence of words to be exe-
cuted if certain conditions are met. Let us consider the following command given
through the CLI of the bridge node:
bcst tell: close-to-window? [if] red led on [then] :tell ;
This command broadcasts (bcst is the reserved address for the purpose) the
code between the tell: and :tell words. Once received, each node executes
the word close-to-window? to evaluate if it is close to the window and, if so
turns the red LED on. The word close-to-window?, already in the dictionary,
performs temperature and luminosity measurements and checks if both sensory
readings are above a predeﬁned threshold. As it can be noticed, the code is quite
understandable, although all the words operate just above the hardware level
by setting ports or enabling the ADCs to read temperature and light exposure.
This code, as well as those in the rest of the paper, has been used on Iris Mote
nodes equipped with the MTS400 sensor board to acquire data about tempera-
ture and light exposure. For the sake of showing how it is possible to incorporate
in our middleware new abstractions to support intelligent applications here we
introduce a Fuzzy Logic extension. Fuzzy Logic has the peculiarity to be appro-
priate to implement approximate reasoning in several contexts as well as for
machine learning purposes [10]. We adopted a classic Forth Fuzzy Logic imple-
mentation [11] that we enriched with the possibility to exchange deﬁnitions and
evaluation among nodes. Moving on with the above example, in place of two
crisp variables, the fuzzy variables temp and lightexp can be easily deﬁned on
deployed nodes, using the word fvar to deﬁne the related membership functions
(Fig. 1) placed between tell: and :tell. A node can be made measure light
exposure, and fuzzify it with the code:
lightexp measure apply
while the code:
lightexp.low @
pushes onto the stack the truth value by using the built-in word @ (fetch). Rather
than through a thresholding process, a device can establish if it is close to the
window through the evaluation of fuzzy rules in the form:
temp.high @ lightexp.high @ & => close-to-window
where temp.high and lightexp.high are membership functions of the fuzzy
input variable temp and lightexp respectively, and close-to-window is one of
the linguistic labels associated to the output variable. Similarly to the case of
the thresholding process, if both the temperature and the light exposure levels
are high a node can infer to be under sunlight, and thus close to the window.

domain, corresponding to the raw readings values interval [0,1200], is given before the
word fvar, while the word member deﬁnes each of the three trapezoidal membership
functions by using four control points (bottom-left, top-left, top-right, and bottom-
right).

Inferring Nodes’ Distribution According
to Thermal Zones
Let us suppose we intend to make the deployed nodes able to discover their
distribution with respect to thermal zones of an environment lighted by some
windows exposed to direct sunlight, and lamps. Each node assesses in turn the
thermal zone it belongs to, and makes the others aware of this information.
We deﬁned the syntactic construct classification to make the nodes able to
classify according to an arbitrary number of fuzzy variables. With the previously
deﬁned input variables temp and lightexp the code:
temp lightexp 2 classification thermal-zone
creates the new word thermal-zone, which is bound to the two fuzzy variables
temp and lightexp. The new word thermal-zone measures the temperature and
luminosity, fuzziﬁes the crisp inputs and evaluates the rules by storing the ﬁr-
ing strength for each rule, indicating the degree to which the rule matches the
inputs. The rule generation process considers all the possible combinations of all
the membership functions, -i.e. in this case, the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where
a and b are linguistic terms associated respectively with temp and lightexp.
When handling few variables, this does not cause excessive memory occupation.
It oﬀers instead the advantage of considering a ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation based
on all the n-tuples, that in this case, are all valid. However, optimization meth-
ods for the reduction of a large scale rule base may be required in real-time fuzzy
systems [2,7,12]. When needed, the table is traversed to compute the member-
ship grade of the output by aggregating all rules. The rule with the maximum
strength is taken as the output membership class. This way, each node is able
to classify itself into one of the thermal zones. To support more sophisticated
behaviors, it is possible to exploit the mechanism of code exchange among nodes
to trigger the process of neighbor discovery in order to keep track of their clas-
siﬁcation into thermal-zones. For this purpose, it is necessary to deﬁne the table

62
S. Gaglio et al.
nodes-distribution to contain the number of nodes for each thermal zone.
For instance, each device can transmit once, after waiting (word on-timer) for
a time that is function of its unique ID. When its time is elapsed, the word
classification-spread is executed, the node classiﬁes itself into a thermal
zone and then broadcasts the class it belongs to, together with the code to make
the others update the whole distribution. The Forth code required for the entire
process is the following:
: local-update nodes-distribution update ;
: spread dup local-update bcst [tell:] ~ local-update [:tell] ;
: classification-spread thermal-zone spread ;
on-timer ’ classification-spread
in which the word spread creates a message with the code to make the other
devices update locally the nodes-distribution. At the end of the update
process, each node holds the current nodes distribution in terms of thermal
zones, as such:
Class 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
# 5 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
Five nodes belongs to class 1, one node to class 2 and so on. Each node knows
the number of nodes in the network and their position, without any centralized
computation. Once some nodes are moved from their position to another, and
the process is triggered again, each node is able to detect the new distribution.
Moreover, the analysis of the nodes distribution may lead a node to classify
itself as an outlier, to trigger self-diagnosis operations, and even to take speciﬁc
actions, by reasoning about the whole network conﬁguration and its membership
thermal zone. The interactivity granted by our approach permits the program-
mer to communicate with the network through the serial shell of the bridge
node. For instance, the programmer can tell the nodes belonging to class 8 to
turn their red LED on:
bcst tell: thermal-zone 8 class? [if] red led on [then] :tell ;

Conclusions
In this paper, we showed how distributed symbolic reasoning can be implemented
on resource constrained IoT devices by exploiting executable code exchange.
Our contribution aims to ﬁll the lack in the absence of programming paradigms
enabling a vast adoption of IoT in everyday life. The possibility to exchange
executable code makes the system adaptive and autonomous, since each node can
evolve on the basis of realtime inputs, in terms of both data and executable code,
from other nodes and from the user. We showed how abstractions and symbolic
expression evaluation can be eﬃciently incorporated into a programming model
for such networks by exploiting both interpretation and compilation of code.
As an example, we described the syntactic constructs that can be deﬁned to make

the nodes aware of their position with respect to a subdivision of the environment
into thermal zones. Our methodology reveals suitable for implementing more
advanced behaviors on IoT devices since symbolic reasoning is performed even
on inexpensive and resource constrained microcontrollers.

Abstract. The new improvements of ICT technologies allow the opportunity to
use these tools in the learning context and create smart environments for chil-
dren and teachers in schools. In this paper, we present Block Magic (BM), a tool
that exploits the Internet of Things theory using RFID technology. This tool
allows the children to play traditionally with well-known didactic materials, the
traditional Logic Blocks, but in connection with a PC and a dedicated software
that increase the interaction. BM stimulates different learning activities for
speciﬁc skills as mathematics, logic, language, problem solving and creativity.
This low-cost and user-friendly technology allows enhancing the learning/
teaching session due to the software feedbacks and the session tracker. The
software is able to track the sessions of each child, and supporting the learner
with a hidden Adaptive Tutoring System (ATS) that presents to the children the
right exercises, based on the learners’ replies. BM was tested in four different
countries (Germany, Spain, Italy and Greece) in the kindergartens and the pri-
mary schools, the target groups were in the range 3–7 years old. The tool was
tested in a larger scale evaluation that involved 22 teachers and 495 children.
The results shows a high degree of acceptability; that appreciated the concept
and the innovation features. The trials showed some issues to be ﬁxed, as the
usability. BM was a research developed in the framework of a funded by the EU
Commission.

Introduction
The Internet of Things theory was the drive of the research of Block Magic. The
project, funded by the European Commission and ended in the November 2013, aimed
to start from the Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation Technology (RFID) creating a sort of
interactive net between the children in schools, the learning materials and the teachers.
This hybrid environment [1, 2] was based on traditional psycho-pedagogical activities

well-know from the teachers. These activities exploited the structured materials used in
rehabilitation centers, baby-parks, children’s hospitals and the homes. The structured
materials are materials that have a ﬁxed numbers of “n” elements and “m” categories.
The structure is represented by the rules that connect the single parts. Typical examples
of structured materials are logic blocks, cards, teaching tiles, etc. These materials allow
analytical thought, using the isolation of a single quality (e.g. dimension, shape, color,
etc.) and allowing the focalization of attention on a single part of the object, and then,
with a gradual analytical process, the ability for clustering and serialization, in order to
understand the object.
The Logic Blocks was the didactic materials chosen in the Block Magic project for
their wide adoption by the schools. These are different pieces or blocks that differ each
other for different attributes as color, thickness, geometric shape and dimension. (see
Fig. 1).
Traditionally these materials aim at empowering the proactive function of learning
processes and cooperative dynamics between the pairs (children in our case). It is
fundamental underline, that these Logic Blocks, in the traditional uses, propose an
important hurdle. It allows the active participation of pupils, but is extremely expensive
because of the continue supervision of the teachers/parents and the needs of person-
alized educational interventions that are impossible in this context.
The research project Block Magic, ended in November 2013 and funded in the
framework of the programme LLP-Comenius by the European Commission, worked in
order to overcome this limit, and connect the smart learning environment exploiting the
strength of the manipulation. These interactions seem to be determinant in the human
knowledge cognitive representation as showed by the theoretical perspective of the
Internet of Things [3, 4] and the Embodiment Cognition [5]. It demonstrated using
experiments, empirical studies, clinical observations and computational modelling [6]
that it is captured in our neurocognitive structures as a holistic space-based sensory-
motor representation.
1.1
Technology
The technology becomes important for an increase of the satisfaction of the users and
the Internet of Things rules require an interconnection between the things in a smart
conﬁguration enhanced by the technology.
Fig. 1. The Block Magic system

In this point of view, the technology that matches with these purposes is the RFID
(Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation/Near Field Communication).
RFID systems consists of an antenna and a transceiver, which is able to read the
radio frequency and transfer the information to a device, and a small and low cost tag,
which is an integrated circuit containing the RF circuitry and information to be
transmitted.
The aim of the project Block Magic was to create hybrid platforms matching two
different contexts, from one side the digital world usual for the new digital natives
interconnecting more tools in a traditional environment (school or home, etc.), for the
other side the physical world with strong and well-consolidated psych-pedagogical
practices.
These hybrid systems propose some improvements respect the state of art of the
physical and the digital world. The strength points are the ability: (i) to overcome the
limits of the excessive orientation of the screen, typical of the digital applications,
because the user (the child) is active in the execution of the task, playing with the
device and with the environment tools in the same time; (ii) to assess the session
performed by a learner, giving a supporting tool for the teachers; (iii) to reduce the
costs of the traditional lesson that use the structured material, because they need a
continue support of the teacher; (iv) to permit an highly individualized learning path;
(v) to connect the elements in a traditional environment, creating a smart environment.
On these bases, an international research Consortium funded by the European
Commission produced the ﬁrst prototype of BlockMagic based on STELT (Smart
Technology to Enhance Learning and Teaching) a developing tools to build-up edu-
cational games with RFID sensors [7].
From a more general point of view, the ambition of BlockMagic project is to
redeﬁne the learning-teaching Logic Block materials through the use of a cheap Smart
Technology creating hybrid smart environments. In this prospective BlockMagic aims
to reinforce the traditional teaching methods for kindergarten and primary school.
2
The Block Magic Framework
2.1
Block Magic Platform
Block Magic is a hardware-software prototype that uses RFID sensors and an Artiﬁcial
Tutoring System in order to connect different tools in an environment like school or
home. The general objective is to reduce the presence of an adult that supervises the
activities (teacher or parent). The hardware is based on RFID-TAG (tiny stickers) are
on traditional logic block pieces that can be recognized by an active reader connected
to a Tablet/PC. The PC/tablet is equipped with the Block Magic software that simulate
the actions of teachers, proposing exercises, giving feedbacks and maintaining a record
of an individual learning history (Fig. 2).
Operatively, when a user places one or more blocks on the active reader of
BlockMagic, in connection via Bluetooth or cable to a PC/tablet, the system recognizes
the blocks and gives some opportune aural and sound feedbacks to the learner. These
feedbacks support the pupil in order to solve different exercises regarding different skill
66
O. Miglino et al.

(mathematics, logic, problem solving, creativity, etc.). The “smart” software engine,
developed during the project, receives input from the board and generates an “action”
directly on the screen.
2.2
Scenarios/Learning Activities
The methodology deﬁned in the project has three main scenarios: (1) Individual Game
Scenario and (2) Social Game Scenario, (3) Special Needs Scenario. In the Individual
Game Scenario, the learner has to solve a task autonomously using life skills (math-
ematical, logical, strategic, and creative or language skills). In the Social Game Sce-
nario, the group plays/learns with Block Magic and the “social skill” can emerge in this
context. In the Special Needs Scenario, special games were proposed to children having
severe disabilities.
The teacher has the role to set the classroom and introduces the blocks and the
magic board to the children, leaving the kids free to play these materials. The
BlockMagic software allows to the educators to personalize the training for every child,
choosing the exercises proposed for the children in order to seek deﬁned educational
objectives. The teacher acts differently in the Individual Game Scenario and in the
Social Game scenario. In the ﬁrst case, the educator represents an observer and in case
of request of help, he/she could support the kids. In the second case, the teacher
interacts with the children, providing support, observing, creating obstacle, based on
the characteristics of the speciﬁc exercises.
2.3
Trials
The methods, exercises and technologies developed by BlockMagic Consortium were
tested in kindergartens and primary schools with selected children and teachers in
Greece, Italy and Spain between 3 to 7 years old. The trials involved 10 teachers, 257
students, and 2 children with special needs in 4 schools. In Italy, in the structures of
LegaDelFiloD’Oro were performed trial for children with special needs.
During the trails, the researchers of the project supervised the sessions reporting
observations and comments. After the sessions, the researchers made some face-to-face

interview with teachers that participated in the trials. The interview were focused on
three aspects (ergonomics, usefulness and satisfaction) for the three scenarios.
3
Results
The observations and the interview with the experts collected about the Individual
Scenario shows an encouraging view. The hidden nature of the tools permits a high
degree of acceptance from the teachers and the kids in the schools. Their main
approaches was positive and they considered it as a normal tool for the schools,
underlining some positive points and some weaknesses.
Regarding the usefulness, the teachers considered Block Magic an important tool
that could be added in the daily school routines, with some improvements that will
allow an easier use. The exercises provided in BlockMagic are considered balanced for
children in that range of ages. In their opinion BlockMagic stimulates mainly mathe-
matical and logical skills and with a minor degree also creativity, strategic and lan-
guage. In particular, the creativity is stimulated but the children prefer to build picture
using the blocks out of the BlockMagic platform. The feature that the teachers mainly
appreciate was the direct feedback. The teachers considered that Block Magic stimu-
lates the children to learn, in particular the children with problems in concentrations.
Regarding the ergonomics, the teachers referred that the prototype has some fea-
tures to be improved, some exercises contain some obstacles for a correct performing.
For example: the repetition of a same action, the need of place a block in order to start a
game, etc. However, the observations showed that the children after a little time of
understanding were highly conﬁdent with the tool. The pupils learned quickly the
functionalities of BlockMagic and there was few requests of support from teacher. The
learners asked for helps only when lacked the exercise information. However, a
problem emerged with the children between the 3 and 4 years old for the difﬁculty in
distinguishing the thickness of magic blocks.
Regarding the satisfaction, the children appreciated the whole tool, with a strong
preference for the aural feedback (the BlockMagic software is set to call the user by
own name). This feature surprises the children and allows a quick interaction. All
children looked forward to play again with the BlockMagic tool. The teachers
appreciated this element, because the children enjoyed “to learn” because they con-
sidered they were playing a game.

Conclusions
The BlockMagic project funded by the EU Commission, developed a structured
methodology that take from the experience of well consolidated psycho-pedagogical
approaches and a functional platform (hardware/software) using the RFID technology
and the Internet of Things (IoT) approach. The BlockMagic kits were tested it with
selected children and teachers in Greece, Italy, Germany and Spain in kindergartens
and primary schools. The results achieved during this experimentation were very

needs scenario. The observations performed by the researchers and the interviews
collected with the teachers involved demonstrates that the BlockMagic prototype is a
tool that could be easily introduced in the daily routines of real classrooms. The
children are very attracted and excited during the BlockMagic session and they con-
sider it as a game. The system allows a good interaction in social contexts and supports
the group activities. In addition, BlockMagic reduced the negative feedbacks for
children with special needs during the execution of the sessions in comparison with
traditional methods.
It is necessary to underline some limits reported by the teachers in particular
regarding the ergonomics. This element will represent the direction that the authors will
seek in order to improve the features of this hybrid system.

Abstract. In this paper we develop and test a distributed algorithm
providing Energy Consumption Schedules (ECS) in smart grids for a res-
idential district. The goal is to achieve a given aggregate load proﬁle.
The NP-hard constrained optimization problem reduces to a distributed
unconstrained formulation by means of Lagrangian Relaxation technique,
and a meta-heuristic algorithm based on a Quantum inspired Particle
Swarm with L´evy ﬂights. A centralized iterative reputation-reward mech-
anism is proposed for end-users to cooperate to avoid power peaks and
reduce global overload, based on random distributions simulating human
behaviors and penalties on the eﬀective ECS diﬀering from the suggested
ECS. Numerical results show the protocols eﬀectiveness.

Introduction
The balance between demand and supply plays a leading role in smart grids
applications and modern technologies aim to develop energy optimization algo-
rithms able to provide eﬃcient residential district dispatchment. A large lit-
erature has been devoted to decentralized versions of optimization algorithms
applied to power systems, see, e.g., [15], due to distributed energy generation
and demand, renewables such as photovoltaic resources, storage devices, with
changes in real time. Multi-agent planning, as in [11], is often formulated as a
combinatorial optimization problem: each agent has its own objectives, resources,
constraints, and at the same time it has to share and compete for global resources
and constraints. Moreover, new roles in the energy market are emerging, such
as energy aggregators as intermediate between energy utilities and home users,
managing uncertanties due to variable customer actions, metereology and elec-
tricity prices. Given the huge number of agents, the optimization problem is
often computationally intractable in a centralized fashion, and given the time-
varying cost and constraints in energy demand-response (DR) problems, a fast
single-agent planning algorithm is appealing. In this paper, as in [6], customers

are incentivized to move their loads in oﬀ-peak hours despite their individual
needs through marginal costs, using reputation scores as feedback. In [6] a coop-
erative game reduces peak-to-average ratio of the aggregate load and the Nash
equilibria are reached using centralized information, whereas our approach is
completely distributed. Evolutionary Game theory and Reinforcement Learning
techniques have been applied to swarm intelligence problems, as in [1,5,12,14].
Our focus is on energy distribution to a residential district, according to
the European Project INTrEPID [9]. In this scenery, the district global load
is sensed by power meters, and using non-intrusive load-monitoring techniques
(NILM, as in [8]) or smart plugs, the disaggregated data are available, turning
the “blind”system to a decentralized smart grid [2]. A centralized unit senses
local loads, and communicates with agents through smart-phone app or similar
devices proposing day-ahead optimal Energy Consumption Schedules (ECS).
Agents may accept the suggested ECS or not, according to individual needs.
Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide a mathematical formalization of
the optimization problem, decoupling the global constraint through Lagrangian
relaxation as in [10], see Sect. 2. Second, in Sect. 3 we design optimal ECS in a
distributed fashion at two levels: at the agent level applying meta heuristic opti-
mization techniques as QPSOL (Quantum Particle Swarm with Levy’s Flights)
described in [3], in order to get feasible optimal suggested ECS; at the district
level a reputation-reward mechanism provides incentives for users leading to an
emerging cooperative behavior. Section 4 describes the numerical results, and we
draw the conclusions of our study in Sect. 5.

Model Description
Consider a district with N users, each i-th agent has ni appliances that are
schedulable, like washing machine (WM), dish washer (DW) and tumbler dryer
(TD). Refrigerator load is also included as background proﬁle. The state of the
multi-agent system is given by x = (x1, . . . , xN), i.e., a vector of schedules that
each user has to execute in a given time slot, and xi is deﬁned by the start
times of all the ni appliances of user i and their type (WM, DW, TD) with
well-known load proﬁles. Due to energy and time constraints, the goal to ﬁnd a
global optimum of the constrained optimization problem, called primal problem:
min
x=(x1,...,xN)


i=1
fi(xi)
s.t.
N

i=1
gi(xi) = a, hi(xi) ≤bi, i = 1, . . . , N
(1)
where a, bi ∈R and the cost function 
i fi is a sum of weighted norms of three
factors: overload, energy cost and tardiness of the current state x. The ﬁrst
constraint is the only coupling object: gi denotes the peak proﬁle of each user
and the global load of the district must attain a given curve a = a(t) depend-
ing on time. All the functions fi, gi, hi implicitly depend on time (they span
a day), discretized in minutes or hours. The inequalities involving hi are local
time and energy (usually 3 kW) constraints of each user. The Lagrange function

72
D. Borra et al.
is L(x, μ, λi) = N
i=1 [fi(xi) + λi(bi −hi(xi))] + μ(gi(xi) −a) where λi ≥0, μ
are called Lagrange multipliers. Since λi can be computed locally, the Lagrange
multiplier of our interest is μ, associated to the only coupling constraint. From
now on, we neglect the local constraints as they can be included directly in
the cost functions fi. As detailed in [4], the corresponding relaxed dual problem
becomes unconstrained: maxµ minx=(x1,...,xN) L(x, μ). The standard algorithm
is as follows: given an initial estimate of μ, each user computes its best ECS x∗
i
such that x∗= arg minx L(x, μ). Then, x∗is sent to the central unit, and a sub-
gradient of minx L(x, μ) as function of μ is available. The central unit computes
and sends to agents at iteration k: μ(k) = μ(k−1) +α(k−1) (
i gi(x∗
i ) −a), where
α(k−1) is the step length of the gradient descent algorithm. Since the Lagrange
multiplier μ can be interpreted as the energy price, in order to decentralize the
given dual problem., we split μ = N
i=1 μi. A distributed algorithm that can
be applied acts as the previous one with the only diﬀerence: agent i solves the
optimization problem
min
xi fi(xi) + μi (Ngi(xi) −a) ,
(2)
where Ngi(xi)−a approximates the global overload 
j gj(xj)−a. The only com-
putational eﬀort of the central unit is the gradient descent step for μ. The latter
optimization problem is solved by means of the population-based metaheuris-
tic method QPSOL, see [3], that reduces a NP-hard combinatorial optimization
problem to an adaptive algorithm requiring limited computational power.
The underlying idea is to split the optimization algorithm on 2 time scales:
(1) the micro-scale concerns the improvement along the day of the day-ahead
proposed ECS; (2) the macro-scale involves the reputation-reward mechanisms
of the agents, described below, and their collective behavior.

Swarm Simulator Description
This simulation studies energy distribution to a city district managing its total
daily power consumption without power peaks and achieving a given aggregate
load curve. Users should follow utility suggestions and receive incentives accord-
ing to their ﬂexibility. Every day users compute local best ECS in a distributed
way, according to their needs and utility constraints, as described in Sect. 2.
In this Section we focus on the reputation mechanism deﬁning the emerging
learning process. Consider best ECS as daily input data. Agents actions deﬁne
local eﬀective ECS. Two indices evaluate end-users behaviors: (1) reputation
depending on start times of eﬀective ECS, (2) reward depending on the distance
between best and eﬀective (both local and global) load.
Reputation Deﬁnition. Each agent may accept or decline ni suggestions, with
ni number of appliances. Denote by x∗
i the best (sub)-optimal ECS found for
Eq. 2 at the end of each day, and denote by ˆxi the eﬀective ECS decided by user
i. Formally, the reputation of user i along the day is ri = 1 −|x∗
i −ˆxi|
ni

where | · | denotes the distance between the best and eﬀective i-th ECS in terms
of start times of appliances, i.e., reputation decreases as violation rate gets high.
Reward Deﬁnition. The reward is deﬁned in terms of credits: each agent may
earn up to 24 credits each day, comparing hourly the best (b) and eﬀective (e)
two quantities: global load and local load. Formally the credits of user i at hour
h is deﬁned as cih = 1 −|glob loadb−glob loade|
glob loadb+glob loade −|loc loadb−loc loade|
loc loadb+loc loade . At the end of
each day, credits ci ∈[0, 1] are re-normalized and create rank lists.
Behavior and Learning Process Modeling. Each agent acts based on his
own behavior proﬁle, shaped according to (1) favorite start times to schedule
appliances; (2) relevance given to reward and reputation by means of the weight
parameter αi ∈[0, 1], to deﬁne reaction to feedback; (3) natural predisposition
to follow advice, to set the violation probability, deﬁned by standard deviation
σi of a Gaussian distribution. Best ECS for utility are denoted by the start times
vector x∗
i and actions are samples from Gaussian distributions ˆxi ∼N(x∗
i , σ2
i )
with mean given by x∗
i and standard deviation σi representing ﬂexibility. Pro-
ﬁles are modeled according to σi that is initially sampled uniformly in a given
interval [σ1, σ2]. For large σi agents tend to selﬁsh behaviors and do not accept
suggested ECS. Another learning parameter is the weight αi ∈[0, 1] each agent
gives to reward and reputation as feedback, i.e., after each observation period
user i evaluates the linear combination of its mean reputation ¯ri and its mean
reward ¯ci : qi = αi¯ri +(1−αi)¯ci. Given the satisfaction threshold ϵ (in numerical
experiments ϵ = 0.6), if qi > ϵ, agent i is satisﬁed and there is a certain prob-
ability that relaxes decreasing its standard deviation σi, otherwise it increases
according to a ﬁxed discrete random distribution. In conclusion, behavior of
agent i is deﬁned by the Gaussian probability density function f = f(x∗
i , σi, αi).
At each feedback iteration the behavior parameter σi is updated. Houses with
best and worse reputations and rewards are listed as another daily feedback, and
emerging collective beahvior is described in Sect. 4.2.

Numerical Results
4.1
Micro-Scale Simulation
In this numerical experiments, using MATLAB software we run the simulator for
small residential neighborhoods, i.e., N = 5, N = 10 agents and through QPSOL
and Lagrangian relaxation described in Sect. 2, few iterations are suﬃcient to
get a signiﬁcant reduction of the global overload, as shown in Fig. 1. The output
of such distributed algorithm are the daily suggested ECS, and the macro-scale
simulator deals with the learning process acting on human decisions for ECS.

Macro-Scale Simulation
Software used for the development of macro-scale simulation is GAMA-platform

are written in the GAML agent-oriented language, so that each house is consid-
ered to be an agent. We consider a district composed by N = 100 houses and a
scheduled annual load for each resident about 1200–1400 kWh.
Appliances are distributed according to the following percentages: 99 % of
houses have a WM, 70 % have a DW and 30 % have a TD. There are also some
diﬀerences between user habits and families. These are modelled varying the
maximum number of possible daily cycles for each appliance. In particular 40 %
of residents will use every appliance no more than once a day, 50 % no more than
twice and 10 % no more than three times a day. Some exceptions are considered.
The system evolution stabilizes in the presence of perturbative phenomena
on the input parameters, i.e., diﬀerences between eﬀective and best ECS. Using
default value of parameters we can reach a mean percentage diﬀerence (over the
best load) between the best total load and the eﬀective total load converges to
20 % as in Fig. 2 (left).

Varying the number of houses, the diﬀerence between eﬀective and best load
proﬁle stabilizes starting from 100 houses in the district, as shown in Fig. 2
(center). Convergence time varies between 3 and 6 months. Reported values are
the average over 10 simulations with the same number N of homes. Variance is
greater if we consider few houses, while stabilization time increases with N.

Conclusions
In this paper we provide a mathematical model and a simulator of an energy dis-
tribution system applied to a residential district. Once end-users compute local
optima in a distributed way, human decisions are modeled and a reputation-
reward mechanism is performed on large numbers. Numerical results prove the
eﬃciency of our algorithm: on the macroscale with few houses (150) the diﬀer-
ence between best and eﬀective ECS converges to 20 %, and with an average
time of 3 months the district stabilizes. Future research may be devoted to
apply Lagrangian Relaxation methods also to the macro time-scale, updating
individual energy prices each day, as a function of the diﬀerence between best
and eﬀective ECS. Another advance is to develop asynchronous versions of the
proposed algorithms adapting optimal ECS to asynchronous end-users decisions.

Abstract. In this paper we suggest a design research method for eliciting
affordances and new meanings for Smart Objects in the Internet of Things Era.
After an introduction to the topic and the description of some open issues, we
propose to adopt a Critical Design approach, where the role of Ambiguity is
twofold: on the one hand, it is the objective of the observation for deﬁning a set
of ambiguous objects or affordances; on the other hand, it is the result of a
design conceptualization of smart objects aiming at provoking cognitive dis-
sonance and ﬁnalized to understand people adaptation processes and behaviors.

Introduction: Object, Smart Object, IoT
Until recently, people have been used to considering physical objects as material to
interact with for performing various tasks. The human capabilities for completing a task
are enabled by the object’s properties. We refer to these properties as ‘natural elements’
existing in objects and which help people to interact with the objects themselves.
Moreover, these natural elements deﬁne a shared knowledge that people gain while
interacting with the objects without activating of expensive learning processes.
In the last decades a new paradigm has been introduced in the conceptualization of
physical objects [1]. The growth of embedded technology [2] in everyday objects [3],
and their organization in a nexus of elements, is introducing a new meaning for objects
and it is a suggesting new ways of interaction with them. Internet of Things (IoT) is the
concept under which we collocate these new nexus of physical objects and interactions.
The IoT [4] allows going beyond what people foresee and it opens a new oppor-
tunities in exploiting objects’ properties. In this perspective, the evolution is going in
the direction of changing the shape and the appearance of objects augmenting their
natural function with something new. Furthermore, the existing affordances in con-
nected and technologically augmented objects are becoming unable to immediately
communicate to people their actual values and meanings.

This new type of object is called Smart Object. The capabilities of a Smart Object
go beyond what its aspect shows and what people can image, combining knowledge
and insights derived from the original physical object.
The impossibility of establishing a clear connection between objects and func-
tionalities could become a threat for humans, since they are missing their innate ability
to understand what they can do only based on their knowledge and perception of the
surrounding context. As an extreme consequence, with the spreading of the IoT and
smart objects people could loose the ability to use everyday objects to accomplish their
tasks. How can we solve this extreme situation?
2
Theoretical Background
The concept of physical affordance appears for the ﬁrst time in Gibson’s research [5],
where he deﬁnes an affordance as a clear coupling between the meaning of an object
and the actions that it allows. Norman [6] simpliﬁes the term introducing the idea that
affordance is a property that suggests what users can do with the object. Stimulating
people’s actions, the affordance suggests the correct way to interact with an object,
inviting people to do something. Norman also introduces the existence of a combi-
nation between what an object suggests, what people perceive to be able to do and what
really happens. In a successful case, there is a total combination between these aspects,
in a negative case, instead, he describes the existence of gaps (“gulfs”) between what
people are thinking to do and what they are actually doing.
3
Cognitive Dissonance in Iot Era
The distance [7] between physical affordance - object properties suggesting interaction-
and cognitive affordance - the way people perceive how they could interact with an
object - can be formalized using the psychological deﬁnition of cognitive dissonance.
The lack of a clear coupling of physical and cognitive affordances makes the situation
confused and weak. The perceived inconsistency between knowledge, feelings and
behavior establishes an inner state of discomfort - cognitive dissonance - that people try
to reduce [8]. If this inconvenience is very common, it becomes more than common in
IoT and Smart objects. People are continuously stressed by a new and unexpected use
of components of surrounding environment that they are disabling to have a deeper
comprehension of it.
The dissonance is perceived as psychologically uncomfortable, thereby people are
stimulated to reduce or delete it, thus it are stimulated to reduce or delete it changing
their behaviors and their beliefs about context and their components.
This theory is based on the recognition of the existence of knowledge [9] on which
people build their behavior, and, more generally, build themselves. If something
damages this balance, people immediately perceive a tension, a cognitive dissonance,
and they try to react to it.
In a world of IoT and Ubiquitous computing, when “technologists” build smart
objects, technologists tried to adopt the natural affordances present in objects to allow
78

people to understand the way in with get in contact and use them [1, 2]. However,
when we, as “designer”, are thinking about an object provided with more powerful
capabilities and functions, we are thinking about something that could go beyond the
usual way of interaction. Anyway, Smart objects make hard the people understanding
of the real values and meanings of objects through their affordances. What we are
observing is the growth up of dissonance perceptions. The emergence of discordance
between meanings and coupling [10] appears almost evident.
4
A Critical Design and Smart Objects
Starting with cognitive dissonance as an issue, we suggest to use it as a positive
resource for designing smart objects with suitable affordances. With this aim, we
propose to introduce cognitive dissonance as part of a methodological approach
exploiting Critical Design. Dunne and Raby propose Critical design as a new form of
research [11] aimed at provoking critical attention from users about how the design of
objects, their shape and their representations inﬂuence values, ideologies and their
behavior. Supporting Dunne and Raby’s research idea about design [11], we adopt this
innovative approach to provoke people’s reaction and to stimulate their ‘critical sen-
sibility’ in analyzing their relation with the surrounding environment. In fact, stimu-
lating the development of critical attitudes in users, we are able to study the outcomes
for deﬁning critical and innovative insights about future concepts. Stressing cognitive
dissonance we would like to introduce ambiguity in Smart Objects and then provoke
reaction in users for studying them [8].
5
Eliciting Affordances for Smart Objects
We intend to exploit the lack of clear principles for eliciting affordances or new
meanings in smart objects by suggesting a design research method, on top of the critical
design approach, where the role of ambiguity is twofold: on the one hand it is the
objective of the observation to deﬁne a set of “ambiguous” objects or “affordance”; on
the other hand it is the result of a design conceptualization of smart objects aiming at
provoking “cognitive dissonance” and ﬁnalized to understand “adaptation” processes
and behavior [9].
Critical Design approach is receiving much attention in the Human Computer
Interaction and Design research and its adoption is controversial and many ongoing
discussions [12] focus on how to deﬁne a critical design theory suitable for HCI
research and practice. Within this new trend we intend to propose a design research
method capable of “informing”, gathering information, useful in the conceptualization
of Smart Objects.
For assessing our research method we are setting up a two steps experiment:
(a) First, we deﬁne a set of everyday objects (i.e. a pencil) and then observe in which
way people interact with them, how they adopt affordances and how they apply
different interpretation while getting in touch with them. The observation is

carried on as ethnography [13] a sociological method, for understanding the
objects in the “context of use” and highlighting the existing interrelationships
between users and objects, and users and users with objects.
(b) Second, we introduce “in the wild” a set of smart objects (i.e. a smart pencil),
strictly related to the objects of the previous step, containing ambiguity in
meaning and affordances and then observe the ‘adaptive behavior’ that people
adopt as natural consequences of a state of cognitive dissonance [14].
This study will beneﬁt from previous work concerning the embodiment of the inter-
action into smart objects [15–17] and critical design experiments [18].

Abstract. Cyber-Physical Systems are the next generation of embedded ICT
systems, interconnected through the Internet of Things and endowed with data
gathering functions and able to provide some output to users. Thanks to their
features, if opportunely designed, they can affect user behavior on two levels: by
means of the data gathered, promoting self-awareness to motivate change in the
long term, and by means of direct physical cues, inviting users to perform some
action in real time. The concept of affordance becomes crucial to the latter
aspect: it is necessary to design novel, intuitive object affordances that foster a
particular behavior.

Introduction
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are the next generation of embedded ICT systems,
interconnected through the Internet of Things and endowed with data gathering and
communication functions. These systems are not technological devices as PC or
smartphone, but everyday objects ad hoc enhanced with some reasoning capabilities.
Due to their integration in the user environment and/or in the user body, they can track
a variety of user data: physiological states (such as blood glucose level), psychological
states (such as mood), behaviors (such as movements), and habits (such as food, sleep);
but also environmental parameters (such as CO2) and contextual information (such as
places). All these data, related to different aspects of people daily lives, can provide the
user with a “mirror” of herself, a complex representation of interests, habits, activities,
etc. in her life [1]. This can support new forms of self-awareness and self-knowledge,
which can foster behavior change, promoting more sustainable or healthier behaviors,
discouraging bad habits, sustaining therapeutic compliance, managing chronic diseases

[2, 3]. Self-monitoring is an effective strategy to increase a person’s awareness of a
targeted behavior and its level of achievement [4]. Cadmus Bertram et al. [5] have
proved the efﬁcacy of electronic self-monitoring in adopting healthier life styles.
Thus, CPSs have the potentiality to promote some degree of change in users’
behaviors, and several CPSs have been developed in order to try to modify a behavior
by means of self-monitoring, such as [6, 7]. This may happen at two levels:
• an immediate behavioral activation by means of cues from the object, i.e., physical
output such as light, vibrations, heat, etc., which may invite the user to reﬂect on her
current situation, thus possibly triggering a corrective action. For example, a
vibration can notify the user about a wrong sitting posture;
• a long-term behavioral change, by affecting the user self-awareness via the data
gathered. For example, having data about my food practice might make me aware of
my bad habits and thus motivate me to change them.
As regards the former level, affordances [8] can play a crucial role. According to
Gibson, objects naturally offer a set of functionalities to the external world: the nature
of the activities that they afford depends on how a speciﬁc individual or type of
individuals (like all the members of a species, or those that belong to a certain sub-
group, characterized e.g. by a certain culture) can conceive of the interaction with them.
Affordances thus are at the interface between the individual(s) and the world. In the
case of CPSs, how to design the affordances that they offer in such a way that users
may be motivated change some of their behaviors, leveraging the potentialities of the
CPSs, is still an open issue in the literature. In this paper we aim at (i) presenting a
complex CPS capable of promoting behavior change at the two levels mentioned
above, (ii) pointing out reﬂections for the design of affordances in CPSs.
2
A CPS for Impacting User Behavior
To design a CPS that may promote some kind of behavioral change we need three
elements:
• a smart object integrated in the everyday life of people, able to gather user data in a
transparent way, and to provide some intuitive feedback to users
• a complex data structure that integrates the gathered data
• a reasoning engine able to correlate different data and to provide meaningful data
visualizations and complex recommendations.
In the following, we will present a use case for showing how a CPS with the above
features may promote a particular behavior, in particular decrease sedentary habits.
A sedentary lifestyle is one of the most devious features of life in afﬂuent societies
since it causes a relapse of disease of varying severity in the population with high costs
for health care services. Despite the many attempts to overcome this problem, with or
without the use of ICT ad hoc solutions, sedentary habits still are a major issue in
contemporary society [9]. To tackle this problem, we want to design a novel CPS
exploiting e-textile, i.e., materials that enable digital components and electronics to be
embedded in fabrics (e.g., clothes, covers, …), which represents the new frontier for
The Role of Affordance in Cyber-Physical Systems
83

integrating CPS in everyday life. E-textile allows to continuously and transparently
gather a wealth of user behavioral data, not only about user’s movements, but also
about the physical environments by means of sensors embedded in the fabrics. The
CPS should also have a knowledge structure to integrate these data, and advanced
forms of reasoning about them so to correlate different aspects of the user’s behavior
from day to day (for example, to correlate mood with physical activities). To foster the
behavior, CPS should provide two types of feedback: (i) on the physical level, simple
feedback from the object as affordance to do a speciﬁc action: this might be a vibration
or a change in the color of the object aimed at inviting the user to stand up; (ii) on the
virtual level, more complex feedbacks for triggering long-term behavior change: such
as recommendations and data visualization.
An open issue in this scenario is the role of affordance, as discussed in the next
section.
3
Affordances in CPSs
Digital interactive systems rely on dematerialized affordances like icons, pointers,
textual messages, etc., often based on metaphors from everyday activities like sitting at
a desktop, watching through a window, etc. Affordances offered by CPSs, on the other
hand, actually do belong to the physical world of everyday life. This opens a variety of
new possibilities and issues in the design of interactive systems.
Alan Cooper in an affordance sees a stronger correlation between user and action
[10]. In his view, affordances may be designed to provide users with information about
the actions or activities that can or should be performed on, or with, the artifact.
Everyday objects can now be endowed with computational capabilities enhancing not
only their “reasoning” skills, but also their “communication” skills, their ability to
invite users to perform certain actions in speciﬁc ways. The question then is how
designers can integrate the physical affordances of everyday objects with some kind of
new affordances that can communicate more information to the user. Can these addi-
tional information invite users to act towards speciﬁc directions, so to improve their
lifestyles and wellbeing?
Part of the problem is that an individual’s activities and the actions that she per-
forms within them, and therefore her preparedness and will to perceive and act upon a
speciﬁc (type of) affordance, are in turn circularly interwoven with her cultural back-
ground and her narrative situation, so that each term of these dynamics mutually
deﬁnes and shapes the others [11–13]. That an artifacts like a CPS is designed from
scratch is both its strength (because of the freedom that is thus granted to both the
designer and the user) and its weakness (because there may exist only a thin layer of
already established habits relevant to it).
One way to imagine how these novel kinds of affordances could be integrated in
physical objects is provided by the notion of phatic cue. This may be envisaged as an
affordance that communicates continuously a state and its change in time to the user.
It leaves the communication channel open, establishing a continuous “phatic com-
munication” [14] between the user and the object. Such affordance would not use
“atomic messages”, such as texts, to urge users to perform speciﬁc behaviors. Instead,
84
F. Cena et al.

they would use physical communication channels, such as lights, sounds, vibrations,
heat, to constantly be in touch with the user. Leaving this communication channel
always open can leverage the object physical features, e.g. varying its color, temper-
ature, sound emission, to communicate a variation of its internal status or a change in
the user’s state.
In the use case presented, an e-textile can use modulations of colors or temperature
of its surface to constantly keep in touch with the user. In this way, it can suggest a
certain behaviors or change of behaviors to the user not through imperative linguistic
messages, but via evocative, indirect and continuous affordances. For example, the e-
textile in the form of a cover or a pillow, placed on the user’s chair, might change its
colors to communicate how much the user has been sedentary that day.
Designers and researchers should investigate how to leverage the physical char-
acteristics of everyday objects to create these new kinds of affordances, to give life to
new CPSs that, fully integrated in the user’s everyday context, are constantly in touch
with her.

Abstract. Use of Electroencephalography (EEG) to detect cognitive load is a
well-practiced technique. Cognitive load reﬂects the mental load imparted on a
person providing a crucial parameter for applications like personalized educa-
tion and usability testing. There are several approaches to process the EEG
signals and thus choosing an optimal signal processing chain is not a straight
forward job. The scenario becomes even more interesting while using com-
mercial low-cost, low resolution EEG devices connected to cloud through
Internet of Things (IoT) platform. This paper proposes an optimized signal
processing chain offering maximum classiﬁcation accuracy and minimum
computational complexity for measuring the cognitive load using low resolution
EEG devices.

Introduction
Mental workload imposed on a person is an important component for human behavior
modeling as it gives a direct representation of mental state of the person [1]. Cognitive
load (CL) is the total amount of mental activity imposed on our working memory while
doing any cognitive process. High CL can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the performance,
leading to poor outcome, stress, or anxiety [1]. This CL information if made available
on IoT platform in real-time [2, 3], can be utilized for different applications like per-
sonalized education [4], usability testing [5] etc. as depicted in Fig. 1.

Thus measuring CL while doing any task has been of increasing interest. Subjective
measures of CL, including self-reporting like NASA-TLX [6], measurement of error
rates etc., are mostly self-biased compared to object-indirect (e.g. physiological,
behavioral measurements) and objective-direct (e.g. brain activity measurement, dual
task performance analysis) measurement methods. Physiological measures like brain
signals, Galvanic Skin Response, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging etc. can be
used to access CL [7]. We have used electroencephalogram (EEG) technique as it is
relatively in-expensive, non-invasive and have excellent temporal resolution. The
frontal and central brain are mostly indicative of CL for tasks like problem solving,
decision making, and language skills etc. [8, 9]. Different preprocessing steps, features
and classiﬁers can be used for EEG signal analysis. Time-domain [10], frequency-
domain [11], and statistical parameters have been used to access the CL. Here we
tried detecting CL with commercially available low cost and low resolution Emotiv1
EEG device. Hence, appropriate signal processing, machine learning steps are needed
to get desired information.
The main contribution of this paper lies in proposing an optimal signal processing
chain via comparative study among various existing algorithmic approaches using low-
resolution devices like Emotiv. EEG signals are very susceptible to artifacts like eye-
blinks, facial muscle movements etc., hence we used Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT)
[13] for required correction. The accuracy of classiﬁcation can be increased by using a
spatial ﬁlter [14]. We have used advanced Tikhonov-Regularized Common Spatial
Pattern (TRCSP) [15]. Results show that it is possible to get good classiﬁcation
accuracy with Emotiv if processing steps are chosen properly.
The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 details the experiments and the data
collection methods, followed by signal processing steps in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents
the results with discussions. Finally, the paper is concluded in Sect. 5.

Experiments and Data Collection
For the present study we designed two types of reading tasks similar to [12] with slight
modiﬁcations, pertaining low and high CL. For low load condition, subjects were asked to
mentally count the number of two letter words (except ‘of’) while reading an English
passage and report the number at the end. For high load condition, subjects were instructed
to count two-letter words as well as three-letter words separately (except ‘of’ and ‘the’).
A group of 10 participants (aged between 25–30 years) were selected. All of them
were right-handed male and had English as second language. These ensures minimum
variance in the level of expertise and brain lateralization across all the subjects.
The stimulus were presented on a 9.7-in. iPad. Participant were given two sets of
stimulus to work with (i.e. 2 high-load tasks and 2 low-load tasks). The EEG data
corresponding to ﬁrst set of stimulus were used as the training data and the second set
were used as the test data and vice versa. An average of these two observations were
used as the ﬁnal result.

EEG Signal Processing
Different algorithmic approaches tried are shown in Fig. 2 and the details are given in
Table 1. The numbers provided in the construction of various paths in Table 1 are
referred to signal processing blocks shown in Fig. 2. We used a feature vector com-
prising of variance, Hjorth parameters [10], alpha (d), beta (b), theta (h), delta (d),
gamma (c) band powers and ratios of band powers b=h and a=d.

3.1
Comparison of Algorithms
Algorithms were compared based on: (i) the cognitive score (CS) obtained while
classifying the EEG signals following a particular signal processing path, and (ii) the
computational complexity (CC) of that particular algorithm.
CS is deﬁned in (1). Features (reduced feature/output of TRCSP) extracted from
training data were used to train SVM. Same features were calculated from test data also
and fed to SVM. The analysis was done in a non-overlapping window (5 s) basis.
Finally, the over-all cognitive score for a particular trial is given by
CS ¼
P mi  wi
n
ð1Þ
where, mi is the number of windows reported as class i, n is the total number of
windows in a test trial and wi is a weight-factor. For high load class wi ¼ 100 and for
low load class wi ¼ 0. Hence for low load trial CS  0 and for high trial CS  100.
The computational complexity (CC) of an algorithm is the number of processing
steps required for a particular input. In our work we have deﬁned CC as
CC ¼ nc  ðL þ CHHTÞ þ nc  ðmf  FÞ þ ðnc  mf Þ  CCSP
ð2Þ
where, nc is the number of channels selected, L is the computational complexity for a
single channels, CHHT is the computational complexity of HHT ﬁlter, mf is the number
of features selected, F is the complexity for extracting a particular feature, CCSP is the
computational complexity of using TRCSP ﬁlter. Thus (1) and (2) gives a measure of
cognitive score and computational complexity for a particular algorithm.

Results and Discussions
Table 2 shows the cognitive score of low (L) and high (H) cognitive tasks following
Path1 through Path6. Maximum separation between H and L have been marked in
‘blue’. The entries for CSHigh \ CSLow, have been marked in red. We observed this
reverse trend for 3 subjects while following Path4 and for 1 subject while following
Path1. Both Path1 and Path4 used TRCSP algorithm. Further investigation is needed
to conclude whether TRCSP leads to this effect for low resolution EEG device.
Figure 3a gives one-way ANOVA analysis of the results given in Table 2. Plot shows
Path6 gives highest difference between mean CSHigh and CSLow while having minimal
intra-class variance. Path1 gives maximum separation between CSHigh and CSLow for 6
subjects compared to Path6 which gives maximum separation between for 1 subject.
However, the ANOVA results indicate that the Path6 is the preferred path as opposed
to Path1, as the variance for CSHigh is maximum for the same, which is undesirable.
Thus, we see Path6 as the best possible approach in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy
while using Emotiv. Path6 is also the path of least complexity as it: (i) uses only 4
channels instead of 14 channels, (ii) uses reduced feature set – using only these two
features saves computational time for feature extraction and (iii) bypasses TRCSP.

Next we investigated usefulness of HHT ﬁlters. Figure 3b shows the CS for both
tasks with or without HHT. The separation between average CS for H and L is greater
and variance for H and L is lowest for artifact removed signals using HHT.

Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed the optimal signal processing chain speciﬁcally suitable for
low-resolution EEG devices like Emotiv. We have introduced a performance score for
evaluating different algorithms to choose the optimal signal processing chain for similar
low cost devices. The results show that, using Emotiv or similar low-cost low reso-
lution devices, it is possible to measure the CL by probing left frontal brain lobe for a
combined text reading and counting memory task. It also shows that the alpha and theta
band powers, directly fed to SVM, are sufﬁcient to capture the imparted CL. The
proposed optimum signal processing chain also requires least computational resources
thereby making it suitable for cognitive load related IoT applications.

Abstract. In this paper we focus on how information about concrete
actions performed on food should be provided to IoT devices in terms
of aﬀordances extracted from corpora. Natural language processing has
a role in deﬁning which kind of knowledge devices interacting with
machines and appliances should handle when humans send requests
through natural language interfaces.
We propose a model for the extraction of aﬀordances of food from
corpora and their role in sequences of procedural (sub)actions. The food
processor of the future can ﬁnd helpful this knowledge to interact with
users suggesting alternatives in food processing in recipes steps and basic
reasoning about preconditions and consequences in making meals.

One Verb, More Action Types
The way human beings talk about basic and concrete actions can conceal the
evidence that a verb like to open refers to diﬀerent procedural sequences of sub-
actions, dependent on the features of the objects: open the window is akin to
open the door, but very diﬀerent with respect to open the nut. In fact no one
to one correspondence can be established between verbs and action concepts,
causing huge problems for natural language understanding. Language processing
required in tasks such as automatic translation and human machine interaction
is diﬃcult to achieve when reference to concrete actions is concerned, since the
language labels used to indicate action concepts may pick up many diﬀerent
action types and each language shows a diﬀerent variation potential.
This is one of the crucial reasons for which natural language instructions are
not clear for a machine in an open domain communication scenario. The explicit
understanding of the language conditions enabling the interpretation of simple
sentences requires both a solid knowledge of the range of variation of verbs refer-
ring to action and a clear deﬁnition of the conceptual structures embodied by each
language. Without these premises the overall language processing problem consti-
tuted by the linguistic categorization of action cannot be grounded. These issues

are relevant for the IoT paradigm, since this kind of knowledge should be provided
to devices interacting with machines and appliances and with humans through nat-
ural language interfaces. How this knowledge should be represented? How can it be
extracted from language? These are some of the questions that ModelAct (mod-
elact.lablita.it), a FIRB project funded by MIUR, wants to address. ModelAct
aims at providing a cognitive-based model for human categorization of actions.
Since the same verb like to open can denote diﬀerent sequences of (sub)actions -
diﬀerent sequences of body movements performed by an agent - it is essential for
devices to disambiguate between these denotations and to reason on them, process-
ing linguistic instructions with the awareness of movements implied. In particular,
the deﬁnition of a natural language disambiguation module able to guess which
sequences of (sub)actions is required to open a box instead of a nut is important.
ModelAct exploits the ImagAct ontology (www.imagact.it), which identiﬁes the
action categories by means of prototypical scenes. Scenes are short 3D videos, they
are language independent and their semantic value can be naturally understood,
allowing the appropriate encoding in diﬀerent languages (English, Italian, Spanish
and Mandarin Chinese).
In this context, the notion of aﬀordance can bridge the gap between ecological
psychology studies and AI approaches to knowledge management. Aﬀordances
have been theorized by [3] as the possibilities for action that every environmental
object oﬀers. They are diﬀerent and unique for every living being, in that they
are not strictly related to objective properties; rather, they lie on possible ways in
which living beings can interact with objects themselves. Aﬀordance is deﬁned as
the quality of an object that enables an action: it concerns the relation between a
perceptual property of the object and what an agent can do with it. In embodied
robotics aﬀordances are often conceptualized as a quality of an object, or of an
environment, which allow an artiﬁcial agent to perform an action. Environment
for artiﬁcial agents can be seen as a source of information that help the robot in
performing actions, thus reducing the complexity of representation and reasoning
[4], exactly in the same way an object showing such properties that aﬀord sitting
(e.g. a chair) will help us understand how we can use it (sitting).
Conceptual information concerning objects aﬀordances can be acquired
through language. Our focus is on verb-direct object pairs as the linguistic real-
izations of the relations between actions performed by an agent on objects. We
distinguish between general aﬀordances that can be potentially displayed by
every objects - more generic verbs like to take, to bring etc. - and speciﬁc aﬀor-
dances as canonical/peculiar activities a speciﬁc object is involved in, like open
for bottle. Aﬀordance verbs as verbs that select a distinctive action for a speciﬁc
object can be discovered through statistical measures in corpora [6].

A Possible Application: Food’s Aﬀordances for Food

annotation, clustered sets of sentences distinguishing senses of a verb in terms of

(sub)sequences of movements. 800 verbs, both for Italian and English, have been
studied and more than 3000 objects’ mentions are included in the dataset. In
this paper we want to focus on the aﬀordances of a speciﬁc class of objects, e.g.
the one that are involved in making food. In the near future a food processor
can be a complex appliance connected to our smartphones, able to make the
best use of the available ingredients, assembling them following steps in a recipe
that we choose [1]. Information from sensors monitoring the temperature, the
weight and the moisture level of the food can interact with information in recipe’s
steps. It will be possible to monitor the processor from a smartphone and food’s
aﬀordances can suggest alternatives at a certain stage (e.g. “Now they are boiled.
Do you prefer your zucchini as soup or in puree?”). For this reason, a knowledge
base covering a wide range of possibilities and a basic set of reasoning rules on
them should be provided to devices; acquiring it through language means helping
in the settings of naturale language interfaces interacting with devices.
From ImagAct we can extract basic aﬀordances for food nouns (see Fig. 1):
Fig. 1. ImagAct aﬀordances for carrot
However, this knowledge base should be improved including more possibili-
ties. From a corpus of more than 5000 recipes crawled from instructables.com and
parsed with Stanford CoreNLP tools [5] we can add valuable knowledge to our
model, discovering aﬀordances and extracting sequences of actions, expressing the
kind of action(s) that precede or follow the aﬀordance we are focusing on.
Fig. 2. Corpus extracted aﬀordances for carrot
With respect to the knowledge we have in ImagAct, we can add that a carrot
can be the patient of other actions, both generic and speciﬁc aﬀordances (see
Fig. 2). Intersecting the list of nouns in ImagAct that have food as hypernyms
in WordNet 3.0 [2] and selecting the ones with frequency more than 100 in our

96
I. Russo and L. Robaldo
recipes corpus, we obtained a list of 78 nouns. For each of them basic aﬀordances,
local aﬀordances sequences and global aﬀordances sequences can be extracted.
With basic aﬀordances we mean the full list of action verbs the noun can be
direct object of (e.g. for carrot to cut, to chop, to grate, to slice; for milk to
add, to pour, to stir, to whisk; for sugar to add, to burn, to dissolve, to mix,
to sprinkle). With local aﬀordances sequences we mean a pair of action verbs
that in the same sentence are coordinated and have the noun as direct object
(e.g. Take the carrot and dip it or Add a pinch of sugar and stir it). With global
aﬀordances sequences we mean a temporal ordered list of action verbs that have
the noun as direct object in the context of the same recipe (e.g. Take the carrot,
clean the carrot, shave the carrot on the salad). From recipes it’s possible to
locate each action in a sequence, enabling reasoning on actions sequences in the
future in terms of preconditions and consequences (e.g. a carrot should boiled
before to make a pure). This knowledge is not static but deeply inﬂuence by
saliency and probability; with a diﬀerent corpus (e.g. a corpus composed by just
Asian recipes) it could change radically, implying that the information can be
adapted for special needs.

Abstract. Stroke is one of the major problems in medical and healthcare that
can cause severe disability and death of patients especially for older population.
Rehabilitation plays an important role in stroke therapy. However, most of the
rehabilitative exercises are monotonous and tiring for the patients. For a par-
ticular time, they can easily get bored in doing these exercises. The role of
patient’s motivation in rehabilitation is vital. Motivation and rehabilitative
outcomes are strongly related. Digital games are promising to help stroke
patients to feel motivated and more engaged in rehabilitative training through
motivational gameplay. Most of the commercial games available in the market
are not well-designed for stroke patients and their motivational needs in reha-
bilitation. This study aims at understanding the motivational requirements of
stroke patients in doing rehabilitative exercises and living in a post-stroke life.
Based on the ﬁndings from the literature review, we report that there are many
factors that can inﬂuence the stroke patients’ level of motivation such as social
functioning, patient-therapist relationship, goal-setting, and music. These ﬁnd-
ings are insightful and useful for ideating and designing interactive motivation-
driven games for stroke patients. The motivational factors of stroke patients in
rehabilitation may help the game designers to design motivation-driven game
contexts, contents, and gameplay. Moreover, these ﬁndings may help not only
game designers but also healthcare professionals who concern stroke patient’s
motivation in rehabilitative context.

Introduction
Stroke is one of the major medical and healthcare problems that can cause severe
disability, partial paralysis, memory loss, and even death of sufferers. According to
Burke et al. [1], 85 % of patients live with impaired upper and lower limbs after
suffering from stroke. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that every year
there are 15 million people who suffer from stroke in the world. Among them, 5 million
patients die and another 5 million are living with permanent disability that negatively

impacts their quality of life. Stroke survivors may experience limitations in range of
motions, ﬁne motor skills, gross motor skills, reaching, and manipulation. These def-
icits can dramatically change the patient’s daily life that has to be dependent on others
(e.g. family members or caregivers) in doing personal management such as showering,
feeding, changing clothes, house chores, and ADL (Activities of Daily Living) tasks.
Because of these physical limitations after stroke can reduce patient’s participation in
social and leisure activities, community programs, and work activities [2]. As a result,
it may lead to depression, social isolation, and loneliness in life. Rehabilitation training,
in which repetitive exercises are involved, can help the stroke patients with motor
impairments of lower and upper limbs to overcome the physical limitations following
stroke [2]. Rehabilitation is the essential part of the stroke recovery for stroke survivors
because repetitive and rehabilitative exercises can support the brain to get sufﬁcient
stimuli to remodel and to regain better motor control. Moreover, rehabilitation can help
the patients retrain their functional abilities in walking, transferring, balancing, and
doing ADLs.
However, stroke therapy involves daily rehabilitative exercises, which include
repetitive movements of the affected limbs. Patients typically complain that these
exercises are monotonous, tiring, and boring. Chang et al. [2] pointed out that only
31% of patients who have post-stroke motor deﬁciencies perform the therapeutic
exercises as prescribed by the physiotherapists. Early termination of stroke rehabili-
tation may lead to permanent disability in life. Motivation and therapeutic outcomes are
strongly linked [3]. Healthcare professionals generally believe that patient’s motivation
plays an important role and it can largely determine therapeutic outcomes. There are
other factors that can negatively impact on the patient’s motivation in rehabilitative
process such as lack of social support from family members and friends, expensive fees
of stroke therapy, difﬁculty in travelling to rehabilitative center, and lack of caregiver
who can look after them.

Background
Recent studies show that healthcare professionals are more and more interested in using
computer games for stroke rehabilitation [1]. In general, video games are known to be
an engaging platform for the players and gamers because of entertaining, motivating,
and fun activities. Virtual rehabilitation has received a great interest from many
researchers and healthcare professionals because it can provide a real world environ-
ment (e.g. tennis court in sport game or ski resort in leisure game) where players can
forget about their surroundings and situation and pay attention to a task in a simulated
virtual environment [5]. By playing digital game-based rehabilitative exercises, stroke
patients may have improvements in the upper and lower limb mobility as well as higher
level of motivation and fun. Among the commercial games available in the market,
Nintendo Wii seems to be the most promising technology to be used as a therapeutic
tool in stroke rehabilitation. Because of its low-cost hardware and physical game
activities, many researchers have tried to use Wii games in stroke therapy. Basically,
Wii encourages game players to use physical movements and natural actions in
100
A. Pyae et al.

gameplay (e.g., playing tennis in Wii Sports). It has gained positive feedback and
support from the therapists because of its ease of use, entertaining game contents, and a
wide variety of games available which can help patients to perform therapeutic training
and physical exercises [6]. Although Nintendo Wii is useful and usable in rehabilita-
tion, there are some usability issues that can be critical to the patients who play the
games for rehabilitative purpose. For instance, the players cannot customize the level of
difﬁculties in the game itself to meet the needs of different levels of disability. Besides,
it does not convey therapeutic feedback to the patients and it does not monitor the
patient’s progress in every session. The other game consoles available in the market
such as Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation, and Eye Toy are also not designed for
rehabilitation and therapeutic training because these games are only targeted for young
and healthy users. Furthermore, these games are mainly for fun, entertainment, and
recreation. The game content in these game systems is not targeted for stroke patients.
Thus, physical movements in the gameplay are difﬁcult and not suitable for stroke
patients. As these games are solely aimed for healthy players, the motivational content
of the games is also not suitable for the motivational needs of the stroke patients.
Therefore, all these gaps between rehabilitative and motivational needs of stroke
patients and existing gaming technologies should be bridged. In this study, we aim at
understanding and having empathy on the needs of the stroke patients’ motivation in
rehabilitation for designing rehabilitative games for them.
3
Motivational Factors
To design and develop interactive motivation-driven games for stroke rehabilitation, it
is important to understand and to have empathy for the problems, needs, motivation,
pain points, and goals of stroke patients. In this study, we conducted a literature review
to explore and to understand the motivational factors that can inﬂuence stroke patients
in rehabilitation. According to the literature, there are many factors that can have an
impact on the stroke patients’ motivation in doing rehabilitative exercises and living
post-stroke life positively. Social and emotional support from family members, patient-
therapist relationship, role changes in family, understanding in rehabilitative process,
long and short term goals, and music are some of the important motivational elements
that can affect the patient’s level of motivation in performing and continuing their
rehabilitation that can lead to faster recovery from the stroke. Motivation has been
variously described in terms of innate and internal drives or needs, inner stimuli and
responses, and goals or the directions of the motivation. The motivation concerns the
intrinsic and extrinsic conditions responsible for variations in the intensity, quality, and
direction of on-going behaviour [7]. To understand a patient’s motivation, one must
also consider the environmental pressures that can impact on the patient and include the
demands of his or her condition after stroke. In fact, there are environmental factors
associated with most of the patients’ needs or drives. Research on the stroke patients’
motivation is necessary to focus either on the inner needs of the patients, or on the
environmental pressures and demands.

3.1
Social Functioning
Social functioning such as social support, social contact, and social integration, plays in
an important role for the post-stroke patients. Social contact and social support may not
only improve the physical recovery of the patients but also enhance the level of
motivation in rehabilitation. Moreover, it may encourage the stroke patients to actively
engage in the rehabilitative training. Patients who receive social support from family
members are likely to get higher motivation in rehabilitation. In contrast, socially
isolated patients are likely to have less motivation in rehabilitation and they are pes-
simistic about the post-stroke life. Dombovy et al. [8] state that stroke rehabilitation is
the combination and coordination of social, medical, educational, and vocational
measures for training a patient to regain the highest level of functional recovery and
ability. They continue to say that encouraging the socialization of a stroke patient is one
of the factors of well-established principles of rehabilitation for stroke. Santus et al. [9]
point out that the family is a natural source of social support for a stroke patient and it
may inﬂuence his or her functional recovery by providing companionship and an
opportunity for a normal life. They highlight that the rehabilitation program should
emphasize not only the training for physical improvement but also education of family
members and society how to support the patient socially and physically. Deteriorating
relationships after the stroke are common phenomena for the stroke patients and social
communication remains the most stressful issue. Changes in social activities, voca-
tional interests, and role assignments also affect the family system of a stroke patient.
Barry [16] points out that stroke patient’s expectations on one hand and his or her
signiﬁcant others’ expectations on the other hand can strongly inﬂuence on his or her
level of motivation. The people who play a key role in the stroke patient’s rehabilitation
are not only the therapists but also his or her family members, friends, associates in
whatever situation or setting he or she may live and work.
Evans et al. [11] advocate that social support and functional rehabilitative outcome
after stroke are positively linked, suggesting that the support and involvement of family
members in rehabilitation are important to speed up the recovery from the stroke.
Although family encouragement was one of the factors that can positively affect the
stroke patient’s motivation, pushing too hard to make improvements in rehabilitation
can lead to lower level of patient’s motivation in therapeutic training [3]. In addition to
this, overprotection can reduce the patient’s level of motivation. Social connection with
family members and friends is an important factor for patients after stroke but it is very
challenging for them to communicate with other people such as understanding what
people say, expressing their emotions, talking to other people, walking, eating out, and
shopping. It can make the stroke patients feel depressed, discouraged, disconnected,
and isolated at a time when they need more social support from family members,
friends, and relatives [10]. It is true to say that everyone needs social support and stroke
patients cannot be excluded from their social needs. There are many ways that family
members and friends can socially support the stroke patients such as companionship
from family members, peer’s support in rehabilitation, sharing information about stroke
rehabilitation and recovery, trying new things for them, listening to their concerns and
frustration, sharing their stories, keeping connection with old friends, helping in social
102
A. Pyae et al.

outing, participating in social events and activities, and making new friends. Shimoda
and Robinson [12] state that a lack of social support can prevent the stroke patients
from regularly attending rehabilitative training or lead to a lack of motivation in doing
rehabilitative exercises. Most stroke patients can get their motivation through inter-
action with their beloved ones such as playing with their grandchildren (e.g. inter-
generational games), eating out with partners, going cinema with their friends, and
socializing with neighbours [13]. Krause et al. [17] states that in general, social support
covers the terms such as affective support, information support, and tangible
support [17].
3.2
Patient-Therapist Relationship
One of the most important motivating factors is the use of the therapist’s relationship
with the patient as a form of bringing about the patient’s recovery, readjustment, and
rehabilitation after stroke [16]. The relationship between the stroke patient and the
therapist forms one of the motivational elements in rehabilitation. Maclean et al. [3]
mention that if a therapist has low expectations of how a patient will perform in
rehabilitative tasks, it may cause a negative effect on the patient’s motivation. Positive
feedback, support, and encouragement from the therapist are important for the stroke
patients to gain conﬁdence and positive emotions in rehabilitation. The therapists can
encourage stroke patients to feel more conﬁdent and motivated to continue to do
rehabilitative exercises in the process of stroke recovery whereas giving confusing
messages to the patients about the role of therapists in rehabilitation could lead to
unnecessary misunderstanding in therapy and it may negatively impact on the patient’s
motivation in continuing rehabilitation process. The therapist can increase the moti-
vation of stroke patients by striking up a rapport with patients and discussing about
their lives before and after stroke [3]. Generally, the therapists not only help the
patients improve in physical rehabilitation but they can also consult the patient’s social
and family issues. Therefore, the relationship between therapists and stroke patients are
crucial in stroke rehabilitation.
3.3
Setting Relevant Rehabilitative Goal
Post-stroke rehabilitation is described as a long-term process where the patient and the
healthcare team try to get an agreement on the activities to be focused and the goals to be
achieved through interaction, negotiation, and collaboration between the stroke patient
and the healthcare professionals such as doctors, therapists, and caregivers. Setting a
relevant rehabilitative goal can positively affect on the stroke patient’s motivation.
However, the goals should be meaningful, realistic, achievable, and measurable. The
smaller goals for stroke patients should be related to real-life goals which are mean-
ingful, achievable, and realistic. Moreover, the personalized rehabilitation goals may
enhance the level of motivation of stroke patients in rehabilitation. These personalized
goals may vary from patient to patient. For example, a particular stroke patient may want
to re-enter into the working life or to drive a car when he or she recovers from the stroke
whereas another stroke patient may want to be more independent in doing ADLs.
Understanding Stroke Patients’ Motivation for Motivation-Driven Rehabilitative
103
www.ebook3000.com

Therefore, a goal that can link to individual needs and wants may positively impact on
the stroke patient’s motivation and engagement in rehabilitation. Therapists and
caregivers need to help the stroke patients to achieve the smaller goals of therapy such as
better movements of limbs followed by the bigger goals such as re-integrating into
community and going back to work [13].
3.4
Rehabilitative Setting and Environment
Rehabilitative environment is regarded as one of the important factors for patients’
motivation in rehabilitation. Generally, it involves well-designed and patient-friendly
rehabilitation room, communal meals, and group training sessions where the stroke
patients can share their experiences about rehabilitation and learn each other’s progress
in training, are the positive factors of motivation that fasten recovery from stroke.
Almost every stroke patient has to go through a rehabilitation process after they have
gone through an acute hospital. They have to spend most of their time at a rehabili-
tation centre before they regain the functional abilities of the impaired limbs. Therefore,
the role of the rehabilitative environment such as a rehabilitation training room, a
setting of the gymnasium, and people in this environment, is important for the stroke
patients to feel comfortable, convenient, and secure. In addition to personal factors such
as health history and condition, gender, role changes in family, sex, social background,
and educational background, individual patient’s motivation may be impacted also by
environmental inﬂuences that involve physical condition, social and emotional con-
dition, and individual attitudes for rehabilitation [18].
3.5
Information from Healthcare Professionals
Highly motivated patients feel that education and information provided by the
healthcare professionals can change their thinking about therapy. They may see it as
not only a helpful solution but also the necessity of an important role in stroke reha-
bilitation [14]. Before a particular patient starts his or her rehabilitation program, it is
important for the therapists to explain the information about rehabilitation and thera-
peutic exercises. In this way, the patients can understand the process of rehabilitation
and the beneﬁts of the exercises. Moreover, understanding the process of rehabilitation
and its beneﬁts can enhance the patients’ level of motivation and engagement in
rehabilitation. The information of rehabilitation process from the therapists and their
explanation are important for the stroke patients to understand their condition, process,
and progress very well, and which may lead to a higher motivation in rehabilitation and
faster recovery from stroke.
3.6
Meaningful Rehabilitative Task
Occupational therapy (OT) includes relearning skills for doing activities of daily living
for the patients to get independence in their daily lives. For example, personal
grooming, showering, toileting, meal preparation, and money management are some of
104
A. Pyae et al.

the ADL tasks in occupational therapy. These OT exercises are meaningful and they
reﬂect the social lifestyles of the stroke patients. By doing activity based exercises (e.g.,
ADL-based rehabilitative exercises), the patients may feel motivated and more engaged
in the exercises. Flores et al. [15] advocate that meaningful tasks should be integrated
into the rehabilitation. By doing meaningful rehabilitative tasks, patients can get a
direct relationship between the use of impaired limbs in the therapeutic training and the
use in their activities of daily living.
3.7
Individual Needs and Customization
As motoric impairment can be different from one patient to another, successful reha-
bilitative program requires personalization or customization for the individual patients
to address their problems, to meet their needs, and to adapt individual’s motoric level.
Adaptability is one of the important factors for individual patients so that the difﬁculty
level can be increased when the patient’s motoric abilities improve in a particular
period [15]. Understanding individual stroke patient’s needs, focusing on personalized
or customized motivation, looking beyond simple fun elements to provide engaging
and correct upper or lower limb movements and activities are the difﬁcult challenges in
stroke rehabilitation.
3.8
Positive Feedback from Therapist
The encouragement from medical professionals such as doctors, therapists, and nurses,
plays a vital role in stroke rehabilitation. Often, the therapists have to not only explain
the information about rehabilitation but support them with positive feedback so that the
patients can feel more conﬁdent, motivated, and engaged in what they are doing. The
feedback from the therapist to the patients should be positive to encourage them to
actively engage in the rehabilitation. It may help them feel more motivated in per-
forming the rehabilitative tasks and encourage them to be more engaged, active, and
conﬁdent. Feedback plays an important role in rehabilitative training to maintain and
sustain the motivation of individual patient during the rehabilitation process. Extrinsic
feedback or external response can encourage the persistence to perform better in a
situation of physical education [19].
3.9
Music for Rehabilitation
Everyday many people expose music for different reasons such as relaxation, interest,
and motivation. Generally, people use music to achieve different types of goals in
everyday life such as to motivate in doing exercises, to get relaxation, to pass time
when driving for long hours or taking bus for long distance. Music is an interesting area
for the healthcare professionals and researchers to study on how it may affect the stroke
patient’s motivation in therapeutic way. Music therapy may be effective in reducing
negative emotions such as anger, depression, and anxiety, whereas promoting positive
affections such as happiness, joy, and pleasant. Music Therapy can be used as listening

therapy for the stroke patients to listen to a list of songs that caregiver or music
therapist has selected for them to match a mood or to bring back memories [13]. Music
can trigger the positive emotions of the stroke patients that may lead to more
engagement in doing rehabilitative exercises. Music can be used as a healing tool in the
social and personal context that can have a positive impact on the emotion of individual
patient who is recovering from a stroke. Moreover, it can enable social interaction
between the therapist and the patient or among a group of people in a rehabilitative
training session [20]. Music may affect the physical, mental, and social components of
the post-stroke rehabilitation process in many ways such as therapeutic listening and
rhythmic movements.
3.10
Recreational Activities for Stroke Patients
Recreational activities such as playing digital games or board games, singing songs,
participating in social outings, and going out for shopping, are recognized as moti-
vational elements for the stroke patients that enable better social connection and
re-integration with peers, friends, therapists, and communities. By participating in
recreational activities, the stroke patients may regain a sense of social reintegration and
better social ties with other people. Moreover, it may overcome the issues of social
isolation and depression and it may help the stroke patients to feel more motivated in
rehabilitation training and improve their quality of life. There are many beneﬁts of
leisure activities that can positively affect individual well-being and quality of life.
Recreational activities also help the stroke patients to enhance their physical and mental
health condition, together with personal growth and social communication. Leisure
activities are suitable for everyone who can experience positive moments from doing
these activities regardless of what state of health he or she is in. While the types of the
recreational activities a person has done before the stroke might be different from the
leisure activities that he or she is currently doing in post-stroke life, the feeling of
wellbeing that one gets from these recreational activities will not be different [21].

Discussion
Understanding the stroke patient’s motivation in doing rehabilitative exercises is an
important step in designing digital games for stroke patients and rehabilitation. Thus,
the ﬁndings from understanding motivational elements of stroke patients in rehabili-
tation can be applied as design inputs and considerations in the game design process.
According to the literature review, social functioning such as social ties with friends,
peers, and family members and social communication, is one of the most important
motivational factors for the stroke patients to get motivated in doing the rehabilitative
exercises which is why it is one of the most important design inputs for designing a
game for stroke rehabilitation. In designing a digital game for rehabilitative purpose,
we can design multiplayer game where two or more players can play the game together
so that they can socially connect with each other through the gameplay. By playing
multiplayer games, the stroke patients can build up the social ties with peers and have a
106
A. Pyae et al.

mutual understanding between patients in a similar situation. Moreover, not only the
patients but also the therapists or other healthcare professionals can monitor or even
participate in the multiplayer game. To achieve the idea of improving socialization of
the stroke patients, we can also design intergenerational games for them to maintain the
social connection between the patients and their family members. According to Llyod
[24], intergenerational communication between older adults and younger generation
can decrease the prevalence of ageing and it can considerably support to improve the
mental health and physical well-being amongst the elderly group. With regard to the
digital game-based socialization, Theng et al. [25] insist that generally computer-
mediated games can provide inter-generational gameplay (e.g. Multiplayer Sport
Games). Moreover, it can support entertaining and socializing features that are used as
tools to promote positive mental health, social health, and physical well-being of the
older adults. To design digital games for stroke patient’s rehabilitation, the concept of
“Patient-Therapist relationship” can be used as a basis for the relationship between
virtual therapist and the player. Virtual therapist can be a narrator or a virtual coach in
the rehabilitative training in the game itself. In addition to this, the customization of the
avatar’s identity selected by the player can be integrated in the game so that the player
may have stronger connection to the virtual therapist in the game. According to Kenny
et al. [26], Virtual Human Agent technology has been used by the researchers to
develop 2D or 3D characters that are used in virtual reality games and applications. For
example, these virtual characters can be designed as virtual therapists, virtual nurses,
and caregivers in the context of stroke rehabilitation.
With regard to the setting a relevant and achievable goal in the rehabilitation, we
can account this as a goal-based game for the stroke patients. It is important that the
goals are realistic and achievable and meet the individual’s needs. In designing a goal-
based game, we can allow the player to set a particular goal to achieve at particular
levels or to get certain ranks or to earn certain points or scores in the game. In this way,
the player can feel more motivated and engaged in the gameplay. Well-maintained and
clean rooms, friendly social interaction, and stroke patient friendly facilities are
amongst the important settings in the rehabilitative context that can have an impact on
the level of motivation. For the game design, game environment or context should be
more realistic and familiar to the players and should reﬂect their social lifestyle. By
designing a game environment reﬂecting the stroke patients’ social lifestyle, it can help
them to feel more engaged in the game itself, which can improve the level of their
motivation. For example, we can design a virtual shopping game environment in which
the players can do shopping activities that they used to do before the stroke. Pyae et al.
[27] advocate that in designing game for stroke patients, game environment should be
meaningful and it should reﬂect the player’s social background.
Information provided by the healthcare professionals such as doctors, therapists,
and nurses, is important for the stroke patient in stroke rehabilitation. In the game
design, we can use this concept as a help system; for example, virtual training by a
virtual therapist, and information provided by a virtual nurse or caregiver on how to
conduct the game. In addition, a virtual character (e.g. virtual therapist) can provide the
progress of the gameplay, game scores, and game incentives in real-time during the
gameplay. Physical therapy focuses on regaining strength and mobility of the upper or
lower limbs by doing therapeutic exercises whereas occupational therapy focuses on
Understanding Stroke Patients’ Motivation for Motivation-Driven Rehabilitative
107

relearning real activities (e.g. ADL, community reintegration, personal management
and cognitive skills) that a patient has lost after suffering from the stroke. These ADL-
based tasks are basically meaningful and realistic to the patients. In a game environ-
ment, we can also include real world tasks in the game activities. For example, we can
design a cooking game for the stroke patients where they can prepare and cook the
meal and at the same time, they perform therapeutic movements followed by cognitive
skills such as choosing the right ingredients for the food and manage the cooking time.
Furthermore, we can design a game that based on real-world activities such as simu-
lation for driving a car, virtual shopping tasks, use of mobile phone or ATM or public
phone, purchase of a public transport ticket, and other social activities. According to
Pyae et al. [27], by playing meaningful game tasks, the stroke patients may feel more
engaged, motivated, and active in the rehabilitative training.
In stroke rehabilitation, the individual needs may vary from patient to patient. Thus,
the therapists and nurses have to customize the rehabilitation based on the individual
requirements and goals. As a game design consideration, it is important to implement
the player’s personalization and customization in the game itself such as user proﬁle,
game levels, game scores, and ranks. When designing games for stroke patients, we can
customize the game-based therapeutic activities or tasks to reﬂect the individual needs
and resistances such as strength, mobility, and endurance of upper limbs. User proﬁle,
avatar customization, and game level setup (e.g. easy, hard, and master) can be
included in the game design which allows the therapists or the patients to customize the
games to meet their individual needs. By achieving certain levels the players may feel
more engaged and motivated in the gameplay. Real-time game feedback is considered
as one of the most important elements in general game design. In stroke rehabilitation,
positive feedback from therapists in rehabilitative training should encourage the stroke
patients. In the game design, it should emphasize giving positive and encouraging
feedback such as progression level, positive feedback in audio or visual display by the
game itself, and certain scores as incentives for the players in whatever situation they
are. By getting encouraging feedback or incentives from the game, the players may
actively involve in the gameplay and it is bound to increase their level of motivation.
Music therapy is helpful for stroke survivors not only for entertaining but also for
therapeutic purpose. Since music can be used as an emotionally stimulating tool, music
therapy can also help to enhance or maintain one’s mental health and physical well-
being, communication, social well-being, and quality of life [23]. The role of music is
vital in designing digital games. The background music and audio feedback form
important game elements to judge if a particular game is interactive, engaging, and
enjoyable. When designing and developing interactive games for stroke patients, it is
important to choose the right genre of music and audio feedback so that the patients
feel more engaged and active in the gameplay. Finally, recreational activities (e.g. chess
games, singing games, shopping games, card games, and puzzle) can be integrated into
the game design to improve the stroke patient’s motivation in the gameplay.
After considering all the motivational factors that can have an impact on the stroke
patient’s level of motivation and rehabilitative outcome, we can suggest game design
guidelines and ideas for designing and developing interactive games for stroke patients
and rehabilitation. Table 1 lists the motivational factors of stroke patients and game
design inputs and considerations for the game designers.

Conclusion
We listed motivational factors of stroke patients’ rehabilitation based on the literature.
The factors are useful and insightful when designing digital games for stroke patients
and their rehabilitation. We outlined game design considerations based on the moti-
vational factors. At the moment, we are implementing motivation-driven functional
games, which will be followed user testing and evaluation with stroke patients and
therapists. This practical work will help us to evaluate and improve the approach we
have outlined in this paper.

Abstract. This paper presents initial concepts from the REHAB@HOME
project investigating the patient-centered design of game environments aimed to
raising patients’ motivation and compliance with motor-cognitive rehabilitation
programs. During the initial phase of the project a patient’s client was developed
to deploy ﬁve rehabilitation games through main gaming platforms and inter-
action devices (Kinect, LeapMotion, Sifteo Cubes). Also, a professional client
was designed to enable clinicians the remote monitoring of patients’ progress in
home settings. We discuss main features developed for both clients that can
inform the future realization of game-based solutions for upper body rehabili-
tation programs.

Introduction
Stroke is the second most common cause of death in Europe (EU Cardiovascular
Disease statistics, 2012) and it affects about 15 million people worldwide each year.
Stroke survivors experience a broad range of problems that can impact their cognitive
and motor systems, leading to chronic disability (e.g., hemiparesis) more often affecting
the upper body (i.e., arms, Dobkin, 2005). The goal of rehabilitation is to help sur-
vivors become as independent as possible and to attain the best possible quality of life.
For over half of stroke patients, rehabilitation will be a long‐term process requiring
work supervised by therapists, supported by specialized equipment, lasting several
months. However, increasing cost pressure on the healthcare system is leading to
shorter periods of intensive rehabilitation at specialized facilities. Therefore the

adoption of suitable technologies for in home rehabilitation, together with a proper
training about the execution of a personalized program of exercises, can help reduce the
patient’s stay at the hospital, as well as the need and cost of reaching the rehabilitation
facilities and helping in relapse prevention or improving the patient’s state to his
potential. In this work, we present early concepts for a patient client and a professional
client, realized in the REHAB@HOME European project in collaboration with ther-
apists and patients in Italy and Austria, aimed at supporting in-home rehabilitation of
the upper body.

Related Work
In the area of rehabilitation research and practice, there have been previous attempts to
leverage on low cost gaming platforms, such as Wii (Deutsch et al., 2008) and Play-
station 2 EyeToy (Flynn et al., 2007), to support post-stroke therapy. However, these
solutions are difﬁcult to deploy with patients in earlier stages of recovery when they
have only limited range of motion. For this type of patients other more speciﬁc game-
based solutions have been recently proposed. Huber et al. (2008) and Jack et al. (2001)
developed haptic glove based games in which users scare away butterﬂies, play the
piano, and squeeze virtual pistons to improve the player’s ﬁnger ﬂexion and extension.
Burke et al. (2009) built two webcam color tracked games similar to whack-a mole. In
addition, they created a physics-based orange catching game and a whack-a-mouse
game, both controlled with magnetic sensors and a vibraphone game, using a Wii
remote as a pointing device. Game concepts and solutions more related to everyday
tasks and activities of daily living have been explored to increase patients’ motivation
to play, by providing more meaningful settings (Sanchez et al. 2006; Burke et al.
2009). Flores et al. (2008) identiﬁed game design criteria that stem from stroke reha-
bilitation and elderly entertainment. Vandermaesen et al. (2013) developed the Lifta-
cube prototype for training of the upper extremities and tested it with four patients
(affected by cerebrovascular accident or paraplegia) ﬁnding encouraging results and
beneﬁts regarding patients’ motivation.
In our work, instead of focusing on developing games for speciﬁc ranges of dis-
ability we aim to realize solutions that can be adapted for use by patients at different
levels of recovery (a similar approach was proposed in Alankus, 2011). By informing
our design with requirements from therapists and patients, we aim to realize a reha-
bilitation platform enabling therapists to select and tailor games for individual patients’
programs.

Game Design for Motor Rehabilitation
During the ﬁrst year of the REHAB@HOME project we conducted a patient centered
design process to realize a set of rehabilitation games targeting post-stroke and multiple
sclerosis patients in need of upper body motor rehabilitation. The design process also
involved requirements collected by interviewing a number of therapists at Fondazione
Don Gnocchi (Italy) and Neurological Therapeutic Centre Gmundnerberg (Austria).
A Game-Based Solution for In-Home Rehabilitation
113
www.ebook3000.com

We ended up developing a patient client providing access to four games, three of which
could be played with the Kinect gaming platform, one with the SifteoCubes platform.
We also decided to include in the experimentation an available game for the novel
LeapMotion device (a sensor controller that supports hand and ﬁnger motions as input,
analogous to a mouse, but requiring no hand contact or touching). The criteria for
inclusion and development of these 5 games, was to assess their beneﬁts for deploy-
ment in the context of arm/hand motor rehabilitation sessions. The speciﬁc movements
required by the games were the following: shoulder abduction, adduction, ﬂexion,
extension, wrist ﬂexion, extension, supination, opening/closing of hand, reaching
movements and ﬁnger movements of precision. In the following we brieﬂy describe the
games realized and deployed in the ﬁrst two years of the project (Fig. 1 shows the menu
screen on the patient client for selecting the Kinect games developed):
(1) Bombs & Flowers minigame [Kinect]: the patient interacts in a living room
environment where s/he has to touch ﬂowers items and avoid bombs. S/he is
required to use both hands moving them from the center of the body to the sides
and is provided instructions, visual feedback, and total score achieved during the
session.
(2) Can minigame [Kinect]: the patient needs to move cans from a central table to the
correct shelf, by matching corresponding colors which change position during the
game; s/he can use just one hand per session (s/he can change hands between
sessions) and get instructions, visual feedback and overall score achieved.
(3) Blackboard minigame [Kinect]: the patient needs to move different shapes from
the left side to colored spots on the right side, by following a random path using
only one hand. Random pairings are proposed (e.g. star-blue, square-red) on the
top of the screen, red dots appear along the path, which should be collected;
instructions, visual feedback and overall score are also provided.
(4) Caterpillar game [LeapMotion]: the patient needs to guide a caterpillar around the
screen with one ﬁnger to collect numbers in a sequential order, achieve levels and
eventually become a butterﬂy; instructions, visual and auditory feedback are
provided.
(5) Simon game [Sifteo Cubes, Fig. 2]: 3 (1.7 in) cubes are provided in ﬁxed positions
on a table which display colours randomly assigned by the system; the patient is

asked to tilt a fourth cube to select a colour on its display and put the cube in
contact with the corresponding cube (same colour) in the ﬁxed positions; visual,
auditory feedback, number of sessions played and score are provided through the
cubes displays; typically the patient plays by using one hand for 3 consecutive
sessions.
3.1
The Professional Client
In order to remote monitoring the rehabilitation process and manage the patients, a web
application has been envisioned. The Web based graphical interface has two main
views:
The professional station view, which has two main functions. As therapy man-
agement tool, it allows the continuous monitoring, management and communication
with patients during their rehabilitation activities. It can be used by clinical staff to
personalize and schedule the program of exercises for each patient, and tuning on the
ﬂy the rehabilitation program when needed. Besides this, it supports long-term and
statistical analysis of collected data and information, taking into account the data
collected by the patient station during his interaction with the games, such as motion
data, games data and usage information. The analysis of the collected data supports
therapists and clinicians in understanding the level of progress during the rehabilitation
process and in choosing possible adjustments, both in the short and long term, thus
providing, at the same time, a solid ground for a more effective planning of the
rehabilitation process.
The design of the Professional client was conducted by following the results of the
user requirements collection and analysis in the ﬁrst year of the project. In particular,
we complied with the Rehabilitation Plan of Care indications provided by therapists at
the two clinics involved in the project. The Professional client interface is divided into
four distinct areas (Fig. 3), each associated to a different colour, as follows:
– My Patients: including all functionalities for managing patients, like the assignment
and conﬁguration of exercises through the games, and the visualization of relevant
data about progress with the rehabilitation process (Fig. 4).
– My Proﬁle: providing all functionalities related to the staff proﬁle, and tools to
communicate with other staff involved in managing a patient.

Conclusion
This work has presented initial design concepts for a patient client and a professional
client to be used for in-home upper body rehabilitation and its remote monitoring by
clinics. We are currently in the process of conducting pilot studies to assess the level of
usability and satisfaction of patients and therapists with the games and interfaces
realized. The architecture of the overall REHAB@HOME solution will also include a
family client to support the involvement of family members and caregivers in the in-
home rehabilitation process (e.g., providing possibility of playing co-located games to

sustain motivation of the patient, and to get an overview of patient’s progress with
therapy), which will be designed according to information collected from users. In
addition the overall solution will include Web2.0 social and communication tools,
which will support the communication between the patient and his medical profes-
sionals and promote communication with other patients using the system. A longitu-
dinal evaluation of the integrated REHAB@HOME solution will be conducted in 2015
involving a large group of patients and therapists in Italy and Austria.

Abstract. In this paper we present the evaluation process for Barbarossa,
a pervasive role playing game. Barbarossa involves an invitational (preparatory)
and a main execution phase. The former is freely available though Google Play
store and may be played anytime/anywhere. The latter deﬁnes three inter-
dependent player roles acted by players who need to collaborate in a treasure
hunting game. The eligibility of players for participating in the main game phase
is restricted among those ranked relatively high in the invitational phase. Herein,
we investigate the impact of the invitational game mode on the players overall
game experience. The main hypothesis tested is that game awareness (gained
from participating in a preliminary game phase) may serve as a means for
recruiting the most suitable subjects for user trials on pervasive game research
prototypes.

Introduction
As pervasive game prototypes proliferate and gamers’ awareness on this emerging
gaming genre consolidates, research focus is increasingly diverted towards under-
standing the human factors which are mostly inﬂuential to the overall players’ expe-
rience. Along this line, several challenges surface with respect to pervasive games
evaluation and several evaluation methods have been proposed and tested in order to
support designers’ comprehension on the aspects that impact the overall quality of
experience in pervasive games [1, 2]. Game evaluation trials serve as a valuable
instrument for measuring the enjoyment and immersion perceived by players; however,
they typically involve a lengthy and expensive multi-phase process (preparatory
activities, subjects’ recruitment, trials orchestration and monitoring, execution and
compilation of surveys, etc.). The evaluation process is even more demanding when
considering pervasive game trials, wherein trials are executed in the physical space, far
from a supervised laboratory environment. As a result, user trials should be well
prepared and carefully orchestrated to ensure their ﬂawless execution.
The focal objective of evaluations trials is to receive unbiased feedback from
neutral, ‘external’ subjects about the usability, playability and experience perceived

throughout the game sessions. The recording of neutral views expressed by the
evaluators may indicate technical ﬂaws or even suggest essential script, usability or
technical improvements. Hence, the recruitment of qualiﬁed participants is regarded as
one of the most critical and challenging aspects of user evaluation trials [2]. Another
crucial, yet commonly overlooked, aspect of pervasive games evaluation relates with
players invitations. Montola argues that the participation awareness level of a player
during game sessions commonly shifts from the ‘unaware’ to the ‘aware’ state. The
level of awareness may be inﬂuenced by the invitation method employed to recruit
players. Furthermore, addressing invitations to prospective players (i.e. those that
belong to the game’s potential target group) may allow them to gain game experiences
while increasing participation awareness [3].
The pervasive game prototypes evaluated in the past have utilized a variety of
invitation methods for recruiting participants like e-mails [4, 5], personal contacts [6],
announcements/advertisements [4, 7], recruitment of colleagues/organization employ-
ees [8], Jones and Marsden tabulated a list of advantages and disadvantages inherent in
the above subject recruitment methods [9].
Notably, none of the above referenced evaluated pervasive games utilized invitation
methods that enhance players’ game awareness. That is, experiences are missing in
assessing evaluation methods which actually introduce the players into the game; even
more so, no methods have been proposed to allow game designers monitoring and
‘screening’ the players and provide them the means to select the most eligible players
to participate into the evaluation process.
The main hypothesis investigated in this article is that a preparatory game phase
(acting as a ‘qualiﬁcation round’) would designate the players mostly interested in
participating in the main game phase; hence, these players would be the most appro-
priate evaluators as they could be regarded as representative sample of the game’s
potential target group. The above hypothesis has been validated in the evaluation of
Barbarossa. Along this line we opted to implement a freely available invitational game
mode in the Android application market - Google Play, enabling players worldwide to
participate into the game, thereby ensuring openness and neutrality in the recruitment
process. Also by strongly linking the invitational phase game to the overall game
scenario, the players have been seamlessly introduced into the game and gained a better
understanding of its concept and goals.

Game Scenario and Implementation
Barbarossa [10] is a two-phase trans-reality role playing game. The ﬁrst game phase is
available from the Google Play app store under the title “The Conqueror”.1 In the ﬁrst
phase scenario the Barbarossa pirate brothers Aruj, Khzir and Ilyas (known for their
pirate raids throughout the Aegean sea during 1600−1650 A.D.), following a battle
against the Knights of St. John outside the castle of Mytilene and assisted by some
traitors within the castle walls, conquered the city. In this phase the players act as
1 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=zarc.crash.conqueror&hl=en.

Knights of the St. John who try to free the conquered city. Acting so, the players use a
custom Android application which utilizes Google Maps and a turn-based role-playing
game which allows them to complete and create quests located into the surrounding
area of Mytilene. Upon completing quests the players gain experience points that
indicate their commitment and attribution to the game.
The players ranked higher (in experience points) in the ﬁrst phase are invited to
participate in the second game phase called “The Interplay”; in the latter, Mytilene is
freed and the Knights rush in the castle to catch Aruj, Ilyas and Khzir. At the crypts of
the castle the three Pirates knowing that the Knights are looking for them, hide all their
treasures to a treasure chest. Aruj and Ilyas lock the chest with one combination lock
each, while Khzir takes it and ridding his horse leaves the crypts to hide it. In a while,
the Knights arrive at the crypts and manage to catch Aruj as a prisoner. Ilyas, though,
manages to ﬂee and a Knight chases after him.
In order to complete the second game phase, three players should cooperate to
unlock the treasure chest hid by Khzir somewhere in the city. It is noted that the “The
Conqueror” application detects the distance of the players from the Mytilene center
(located on Lesvos island, Greece) while playing, grouping players into two separate
experience rankings categories, the Insiders who play in Mytilene (≤3.5 km from the
city center) and the Outlanders who play away from the city. One of the Outlanders and
another of the Insiders as well as a guest (selected by the Insider player) are invited into
the second phase based on their total experience points, collected in the ﬁrst phase. The
three players utilize custom Android applications integrating a variety of technologies,
including QR-Code scanning, environment sound level recording, augmented reality,
location-based gaming, the Google Directions service, sensor devices (SunSPOTs), etc.
The players aim at completing their assigned missions (based on separate, yet, sup-
plementary scenarios) to locate the locked chest and the two lock combinations and
unlock the chest. Full implementation details of Barbarossa may be found in the
ofﬁcial website of the game at www.BarbarossaRPG.com.

Evaluation Method and Results
So far, questionnaires, interviews and log data (i.e. data capturing the mobility and
interaction activity of players throughout the game sessions) have been the methods
most commonly employed in pervasive games evaluation. The same practice has been
followed in Barbarossa. We have conducted user evaluation trials using all the three
abovementioned evaluation methods; log data have been a critical element in the
evaluation process in order to cross-check them (when available) against player
answers (as compiled by questionnaires and interviews) and extract more safe and
reliable conclusions. Below we describe the evaluation process in full detail. For the
questionnaires we used linkert scale and yes/no questions.
The evaluation process of the game commenced in October 29th, 2013 by releasing
the invitational game mode though Google Play as well as a website wherein the
players could check their rankings. We provided players sufﬁcient time (21 days) to
play the ﬁrst game phase; thereafter we started contacting the highest ranked players
among the Outlanders and the Insiders in order to form the 3-player teams required to
120

proceed to the second game phase. We have invited one team at a time, a practice that
enhanced competition among Phase I players who wished to participate in the second
game phase.
Prior to proceeding to the second game phase we have asked all members of the
3-player teams that qualiﬁed from Phase I (i.e. those acting as Treasure Hunters and
Knights) to complete a questionnaire about their experiences in the ﬁrst phase. Then, we
introduced the players into the second game phase and allowed them a week to play the
game session and collaboratively locate and unlock the treasure chest. Having completed
the second phase, we have invited all players to complete an additional questionnaire
tailored to the scenario they pursued in the second game phase. Finally, each player has
been interviewed about her overall game experience. In parallel, we have collected log
data (e.g. total completed and created quests, game session duration, distance travelled
and speed) about the players game actions throughout the game sessions.
Currently (July 2014) Barbarossa features more than 1500 downloads and a
average rating of 4.04/5 in Google Play. Furthermore, 874 players registered in Bar-
barossa; according to our log data, 262 among them performed at least one in game
action, such as undertaking a quest.
Before investigating the impact of the invitational phase on the overall game
experience, the usability aspects of the invitational game mode had to be evaluated to
ensure that no serious ﬂaws prevented players state transition towards game awareness.
Table 1 presents the responses of evaluators with respect to their gaming background.
Almost all players stated that they are regular video game players, while only two ﬁrst
phase participants have had previous experience with games similar to Barbarossa.
We have also addressed several questions to participants to understand their per-
ception of game usability aspects of the ﬁrst phase game mode (see Table 2).
Our evaluation results revealed that the invitational game mode performed well
without any serious ﬂaws that could affect players’ experience. The above ﬁnding is
backed by the only 6 error reports submitted by players to the Google Play Developer
Console. Besides, the results indicate easy access to the invitational game mode.
Finally, all players responded positively with respect to the games learnability (i.e. their
ability to recall how to perform basic game actions).
After the completion of the second game phase we invited the players to complete
questionnaires about the scenario they pursued in that phase followed by an interview.
In order to assess the impact of the invitational mode to the players’ comprehension of
the game goals we asked the players to express their perception about the clarity of the

The most interesting questions investigating the impact of the ﬁrst game phase have
been asked during the interview, as we opted to allow participants to freely and fully
express their views. In Table 4 we present the interview results concerning players’
opinion on the utility of the invitational phase. Compiled participant answers are
presented as a percentage of positive and negative answers. Answers are grouped by
the player assigned roles into the second phase. The Pirate players have not been
inquired about the ﬁrst game phase as they have not participated to it (they have been
invited into the second phase by their Treasure Hunters friends).
The results clearly indicate that all players admitted the invitational game mode
impact in raising their awareness on the overall game concept as well as assisting the
completion of the second phase scenario. Finally the invitational game mode triggered
players’ interest on the game’s progression, thereby increasing their keenness to par-
ticipate in Phase II.

Conclusion
Pervasive game prototype developers traditionally relied on emails, personal contacts
and announcements/advertising to invite participants and perform user trials. In Bar-
barossa, we utilized an invitational game mode to recruit qualiﬁed participants for the
user evaluation trials. The recruited participants provided valuable feedback and rep-
resented both players located worldwide (as the ﬁrst phase of Barbarossa has been
freely available online) and also located in the area where the game has been actually
staged (Mytilene).
The evaluation results conﬁrmed that the execution of a preparatory game mode,
when applicable, can help developers to recruit highly qualiﬁed participants, truly
enthusiastic to playing the game. Further, invitational game modes may serve as a
useful instrument for developers to train evaluation participants on any technological
equipment used in the game and also enhance their awareness on the overall game goal,
scenario and gameplay.

Abstract. Recent advances, increasing affordability and popularity of Internet
of Things (IoT) technologies are opening exciting new ways of interaction and
sensing for mobile device users. Furthermore, the great acceptance of smart
mobile devices in our daily lives makes possible various ludic experiences,
which could be greatly improved with IoT technologies. This new setting opens
many opportunities for design and development of Pervasive Games for the IoT.
In this work, we propose a palette of canonic interaction models and gamiﬁ-
cation tactics that can be combined for the design of new Pervasive IoT Game
experiences. Subsequently, we present the methodology and results of a vali-
dation interview regarding our model with experienced game designers. Finally,
we present a case study for a Pervasive IoT Game, also giving an overview of
our middleware for mobile communication as well as its extension for IoT,
discussing the possibilities of implementing new Pervasive IoT Games using it.

Introduction
The recent emergence and increased deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technol-
ogies are opening new avenues of research and development opportunities in Pervasive
Games design. According to Gartner Group [1], IoT is “the network of physical objects
that contains embedded technology to communicate and sense or interact with the
objects’ internal state or the external environment.” One example of such IoT-enabling
technology is Bluetooth® Smart (Bluetooth 4.0), which is rapidly expanding in the
smartphone segment.1 Nowadays, smartphones running the latest Android version,
iPhones, Windows phones and Blackberry phones already support Bluetooth® Smart.
In parallel, many companies are designing and producing several sorts of peripheral
devices such as toys, watches, tennis shoes, heart-rate monitors and SensorTags2 that
are able to connect to Bluetooth® Smart Ready mobile phones.

Therefore, very soon, many applications will revolve around the interaction with
smart things, and games will be no exception. In fact, we envision that in the near
future a huge variety of everyday objects, including toys, appliances, tools and other
portable gadgets, will become smart and connected and will be silently incorporated on
our daily lives and on our entertainment.
The referred smart objects usually feature some short-range wireless communica-
tion capability, as well as some limited processing and/or storage capability. Several of
these objects will also have some embedded sensors (e.g., proximity, temperature,
sound, light, acceleration, etc.) which will enable the objects to “sense and ﬁgure out
what is happening in their environment”.
Most importantly, these objects will be primarily low-energy, small, light-weight, and
hence long-lived and portable. These last characteristics will lead, in our opinion, to an
increasing incorporation of these smart objects as central elements in next-generation
Pervasive Games, that is, games in which the traditional boundaries bestowed by tradi-
tional computer games are expanded in the social, temporal and spatial dimensions [2].
The era in which Pervasive and Mixed Reality Games will be part of our daily lives is
already starting [3], and with these new technologies, the gameplay possibilities can be
extended even further. Also, the increasing usage of smartphones3 is a positive setting for
a future in which smart personal devices can interact with smart things. In fact, we think
that smart things and smartphones will be used together in future Pervasive IoT Games,
where the latter will function as the player’s window to the cyber-physical gameplay.
2
Towards Designing Pervasive IoT Games
We open the discussion with the question: Should Pervasive IoT game design be
signiﬁcantly different from current mobile game design? This is relevant because we
are handling new and not widely tested (marketwise) technology. To answer that, it is
interesting to separate two important concepts of game design: the Base Interaction
Model, which is directly related to the gameplay mechanics, and the Gamiﬁcation
Tactics, which are tools and strategies to hold the attention of the player and immerse
him onto the experience, thus transforming the player interaction into a proper game.
For the rest of this section, we propose a model for designing Pervasive IoT games
through separation of the core elements of the game experience. We have to acknowledge
the contribution, as base inspiration for this model, the works of [4–8]. The model was
validated through a qualitative interview described in Sect. 3 of this work.
2.1
Interaction Models
As it would be in a mobile game played nowadays, or in any other console or computer
game by all means, there are base interaction models that are combined to give a certain

gameplay experience to the player. The player could control a character in a tri-
dimensional scenario using keyboard and mouse, or a controller, for instance. The
player could also interact directly to a screen with his hands and control a certain
object, or draw a certain pattern. These are all base interaction strategies that are
applied, and combined many times, to give the player a more complex way to interact
with the game and have a certain experience envisioned by the designer.
These interactions can differ deeply from each other depending on the category of
the game being analyzed. During this work, we use several deﬁnitions regarding these
game categories that are deﬁned in our Game Design and Interaction Analysis,
accessible at http://www.lac-rio.com/projects/pervasive-iot-games.
Below, we present a few of the interaction models we identiﬁed as possible for
future IoT Pervasive Games using smart tokens as sensors/things, those of which are
capable only of announcing their presence/proximity:
1. Find the Thing (e.g. Mobile Geocaching Game)
Tokens: Fixed or movable
Main Idea: Users search for smart tokens. When a certain token is found, this action is
registered on the user’s smart device and/or a cloud service (if the game is mul-
tiplayer). A user can also pick up a token and bring it somewhere else or do a
certain action with it. If the token is being moved, its coordinates could be updated
to the cloud service by the user’s smart device’s own GPS. The user’s interaction
with the token directly inﬂuences the type of gameplay a game with this base
interaction might have.
2. Guess where Things will be (e.g. Radar Tag Game)
Tokens: Movable
Main Idea: Tokens are always on the move. Tokens could be owned by certain users or
be entirely independent. Players might need to guess a pattern of movement or
discern the tokens next position/destination. Players could interact with the tokens
when around them in a way to facilitate this movement prediction.
3. Bring lonely Things together (e.g. Smart Tag Game)
Tokens: Movable
Main Idea: Tokens are owned by certain users. In certain moments of the game, some
users might be required to match their tokens with another token, which might be
in possession of another player. This other player might be required to match his
token with this same user, or the contrary, he could have to avoid this user for a
certain period of time. These play mechanics will of course vary depending of the
real proposition of the game.
4. Things that color other Things (e.g. Zombie Infection or Area Control Game)
Tokens: Fixed or Movable
Main Idea: Tokens are emitters of a certain type of frequency/data. When a player with
a smart device and/or a movable token enters the actuation diameter of said emitter,
the player is then “colored” or “infected” and is now visible to the game as a player
of a certain type/color. The player could now act as a movable emitter to other
players or ﬁxed tokens. This type of interaction could lead to interesting tag/area

control games, dealing with other gameplay mechanics such as map/area strategy
on an urban area and teamwork.
5. Change the Thing
Tokens: Fixed or Movable
Main Idea: When the player interacts with the token, it writes certain data on it. From
then on, the token may behave differently than before, or start broadcasting a
different type of data.
2.2
Gamiﬁcation Tactics for Pervasive Games
For this work, we deﬁne Gamiﬁcation Tactics as features that are capable of trans-
forming an otherwise common action, task or interaction with a game element into an
enjoyable ludic activity. This deﬁnition is used normally for non-gaming contexts [9],
but we will maintain it for this work since the main idea still is to “gamify” an
otherwise non-ludic interactive experience.
The employed tactics normally are what differentiates a successful game from a
failure. Some of them are meta-game features, which means that they add to the game
experience although they act directly from other features of the same game (e.g. game
achievements). Some of them are:
• Improve Certain User Perks when the Player is Doing Well. Each time a user guesses
right, the user gets gameplay points to increase his/her radar cell diameter, or else, use
more radar cells to better surround the token [e.g. “Guess were Things will be”].
• Achievements: Each time the user accomplishes a hard task or passes a speciﬁc
milestone in the game, he is notiﬁed that he “achieved” this goal. The user can
accompany his list of goals in another screen on the game or in another place.
• Customization: The player can customize certain aspects of the game (normally
related to graphical assets) at his will or from a certain pre-deﬁned list of assets.
• Storytelling/Environment Setting/Graphics/Music: The game has artistic compo-
nents that complement the overall game experience by themselves. These are
usually very important on computer and console gaming, but a little less on mobile.
• In-game Fictional Currency: The player gets a ﬁctional currency on the game after
doing certain objectives or achieving certain milestones, which he can use to unlock
or improve other aspects of the game (like the ones related to these other tactics).
• In-game Purchases: Successful on both mobile and console games (Digital Games),
the player has the possibility to buy for real money something related to one of
these others tactics (including ﬁctional currency), which simpliﬁes the acquisition of
new content if the player is not willing to pass through the previously deﬁned
method by the designer.
• Point-Based Ranking or Leaderboard: Also present on Analog Games (e.g. Sports)
and Digital Games generally, the fact that your progress and feedback is scored by
points and those scores can be compared to those of other players induces com-
petitiveness and further interest to the game.

Pervasive Storytelling
Storytelling as commonly known in today’s games could be used in new innovative
ways when applied in IoT Pervasive Games. A game with immersive and dynamic
storytelling could make use of the “Find the Thing” base interaction, for example, and
unfold its own story to the player following the data retrieved by him during inter-
actions with placed tokens on an environment. It could also send a speciﬁc signal to the
token, so that the story will be different when the next user arrives at said token (e.g.
“Change the Thing”).
These are experiences that could be, in the near future we envision, very common
in our daily lives and could be very well used for advertising, public events, social
interactions, massive urban games, and more.
2.4
Game Mechanics and the Overall Player Experience
The design of a game in terms of its playability derives from various types of smaller
simpler interactions. When these interactions are mixed with gamiﬁcation tactics (notably
environmental setting and storytelling), the game gives the player a sense of immersion
and a complex experience that is usually greater than the sum of its smaller parts.
This principle is a key factor in general game design, but it is especially important
in games that are dealing with new types of technologies, those of which usually lead to
new base interactions such as the ones described previously as IoT/Pervasive mobile
nodes and sensors interaction. When these factors are well worked, it means that the
overall experience given by the game is a concise experience that will most likely be
well absorbed by the player and, thus, lead to a successful game.

Validating Our Model – Qualitative Interviews
The goal of this evaluation is to inquire if the proposed method to abstract the inter-
action and gamiﬁcation tactics for the design of Pervasive IoT Games into independent
architectural elements is valid for those who will most likely use it, game developers.
To validate this architectural proposition, we would like to assess if the proposed set of
game elements is sufﬁcient to abstract an independent game experience.
3.1
Methodology
Since our goal is to serve as guideline for game developers interested in pervasive
mobile games and IoT, we aim with this interview to validate that, in a game developer
view’s, the model is sufﬁciently concise and robust to abstract the game elements of
different categories of game experiences. On other level, we also search if the model is
sufﬁcient not only to abstract the game experience, but to fully describe it. Our goal is to
have some conﬁrmation from the developers that the model is at least sufﬁcient for the
abstraction of the experience, not directly aiming for the second “fully description” goal.
There are very few popular pervasive games on the market for us to deﬁne them as a
speciﬁc game category for the interview. Because of that, we will use two other categories
Internet of Things Based Multiplayer Pervasive Games
129
www.ebook3000.com

of games: Analog Games and Digital Games (both mobile and console).4 These cate-
gories represent well the mixture of physical games in the real world and digital games on
a virtual world in a way that ﬁts what is accepted to be a Pervasive Game, since it breaks
the known temporal and spatial boundaries of most games [2, 4, 6].
The interview was conducted with eight game developers, and it was proposed for
the interviewee to analyze three different games. The games were “Tag Game”
(Analog), “Grand Theft Auto IV” (Digital/Console Game) and “Angry Birds” (Digital/
Mobile Game). The subject was asked to abstract the interaction and gamiﬁcation
tactics from the games according to the proposed elements of both categories in an
annex of the interview.5 After the analysis of each game, the interviewee was asked
some questions about his acquiescence with the abstraction he/she just did, and also
asked to comment further about it, making suggestions and critics for the model.
The interview was sent by email and Facebook for the interviewees, together with a
small explanation about it, which comprehended: That it was to prove or disprove a
model to abstract game experiences; That criticism was highly acceptable; That in it
they would analyze three games - and then proceeded listing them; That they had to
check in Page 2 and 3 of the interview about the elements they would want to use to
abstract the game experiences; That if they felt like it wasn’t enough, they should
explain why, and if necessary, propose other elements; and That when in doubt, just do
what you think it’s right.
3.2
Result Analysis6
The eight interviewees were all Brazilians, male, average of 25 years old, 4.5 years of
game developing experience and 20 years of experience as gamers. They all succeeded
in choosing interactions and gamiﬁcation tactics from the balloons in the annex to
abstract each game, differing in their arguments on why they choose one or another
balloon and on the abstraction itself.
Also, as it was expected, the acceptance of the model as “adequate” to abstract the
player experience (Question 2–58 %) was higher than the acceptance of the model as
being capable of “fully characterizing the player experience” (Question 3–30 %). By
analyzing the structure of the negative feedback, we identiﬁed two main problems: a
structural problem and a content problem. The structural problem is related to the
structure of the model, which is either too abstract or too specialized on the types of
interactions and gamiﬁcation tactics. This is reﬂected on comments like this:
“The balloons were a bit confusing from a game development point, and some of them felt very
speciﬁc to describe the games in question. This would prove to be a problem if the objective is
to create descriptions that can apply to any game.!”

The other type of problem is a content problem, which happened when the inter-
viewee could not ﬁnd a speciﬁc interaction or tactic within the balloons:
“‘Identify roles’, or ‘Identify others logical state’. Something related to each participant in a
way to identify all the others as runners or chasers.”
Which was most of the time because either the interviewee was confused and
couldn’t ﬁnd a balloon that expressed what he wanted, or that balloon actually wasn’t
there, thus, expressing a “lack of content” problem. The content problem doesn’t goes
against the model, since it can be easily solved by simply increasing the variety of
interactions and/or gamiﬁcation tactics, which is not a structural problem with the
model. By considering as negative acceptance only the structural problems, we see an
increase in both acceptance rates for our “adequate” (67 %) and “fully characterizes”
(63 %) game experiences.
It’s also interesting that, from all three types of games, the one with the highest
acceptance rate for the model is “Angry Birds”, a mobile game with many strong
gamiﬁcation elements. The lowest was the “Tag Game”, mainly because of the difﬁ-
culty in visualizing gamiﬁcation tactics for an Analog Game.
Although we discussed acceptance rates, our focus wasn’t really on the statistics
from the interviews, but for the actual feedback as how well the model can be used to
abstract these experiences. In general, it was met with positive feedback, since all of the
content problems are positive for the model validation. Like this answer for Question 2:
“No. They give great insight about the ambience of the game and player motivation, but lack
one important aspect of gameplay that molds the whole player experience which are the puzzles
that must be solved on each level. The scenarios present multiple obstacles that challenge the
player both mentally (as he must discover the solution) and skillfully (as he must aim correctly
to implement his strategy). Suggested balloons are: ‘Puzzle’ and ‘Obstacle’ (relation status
with other elements)”
By suggesting the inclusion of balloons like “Puzzle” and “Obstacle”, they are
actually afﬁrming that they understood the main concept, which is to mold the player
experience with these interaction and gamiﬁcation elements, which is even doable with
the current suggested balloons, since the both experiences can be derived by smaller
and simpler elements.
It is apparent for us that, after the interviews, the model is sufﬁcient to abstract game
experiences, dividing them into interaction elements and gamiﬁcation elements, but not
entirely adequate to fully describe all game’s nuances and every possible iteration of
player experience, since it is, as it was observed looking at the results, a very different
experience for each person.

Case Study – Area Control Game with Mobile IoT
As part of a case study for our architectural analysis of Pervasive IoT games, we
designed a game with enough features as to represent the proposed model. The game is
still under development and its ﬁrst version is due to the end of 2014.
The game is similar to the analog playground game known as capture the ﬂag. It is
a local multiplayer session game, meaning it is played by a certain number of people in
Internet of Things Based Multiplayer Pervasive Games
131
www.ebook3000.com

a speciﬁc area and time, and it has ﬁnite duration. The players will carry smart devices
supporting Bluetooth® Smart technology, and the ﬂags will be mobile objects with
sensors (such as the previously mentioned Texas Instruments Sensor Tag) capable of
capturing contextual information from their environment and transmitting these sensed
data through their Bluetooth® Smart interfaces.
4.1
Playability
Players are divided in two or three teams, each of which owns one or more ﬂags. Flags
are initially placed within a pre-determined area belonging to each team (Fig. 1).
The goal of each team is to take all the other team’s ﬂags and move them to their
own region, but an opponent player can take ﬂags only if they are unguarded. Players
can guard their own ﬂags by staying in the same region as theirs or by carrying them
around the game area.
When players from different groups meet or a ﬂag-taking attempt happens, the
involved players engage in a battle. The battle winners can take a ﬂag if the losers are
carrying/guarding one, and the losers can’t ﬁght or steal ﬂags for a period of time. The
game ends when all the ﬂags are owned by a single team.
Since the game’s theme surrounds the idea of controlling an enemy’s area and
slowly advancing your position (it can be modiﬁed so that each group has several
control areas, or maybe with control areas previously un-owned by both groups), its
tentative codename is Area Control Game with Mobile IoT.
4.2
Tentative System Architecture
Players are viewed by the system as mobile devices and ﬂags as mobile smart objects.
The smart objects are not capable of direct connection with the server, so their location/
state is only updated upon interaction with the players.
Fig. 1. A simple mockup of the game’s initial state
132
A. MacDowell and M. Endler

The server infers ﬂag ownership considering the ﬂag’s last known location, last
owner and last battle in which it was involved. The players are always sharing location
information with the server and listening to broadcasts from the smart sensors (through
Bluetooth). The server will notify a player if another player from a different group is
nearby and their direction. If they are close enough, they can engage in battle, and only
then the players will know if one of them is carrying a ﬂag, being notiﬁed on their
smart devices.
Player battles will occur through their smart devices following a weighted rock-
paper-scissors method. Players will have experience points that will be counted as a
weight on their attack choice, so a high level player can win a battle even choosing a
weapon weak against the other players’. Players get more experience points by winning
individual battles, capturing ﬂags and winning games.
The system architecture on a lower level will follow the ContextNet Architecture
for IoMT Collaborative Applications [14, 15]. This architecture will be further
described in the Sect. 5 of this work.
4.3
IoT Pervasive Game Model Analysis
Being an IoT Pervasive game, the Area Control IoT Game should be abstractable
through our Interaction/Gamiﬁcation model:
Interaction Models. The game has direct interaction between players and things in a
way that: Players have to “Find Things” and “Change Things”. Also, things interact
with players in a way to broadcast their proximity, while player information is con-
stantly updated to the server, which updates other players with the information, which
interacts with other things. This means that, in a way, the interaction possibilities
between things can mimic one of the “Things color other things” interaction.
Gamiﬁcation Tactics. Since the players have experience points that inﬂuence on the
game mechanics, we have the “Improve certain user perks when the player is doing
well” aspect. Also, “Achievements”, “Customization”, “Storytelling”, “Environment
Setting” and “Graphics” are all aspects that could act positively in the ﬁnal gaming
experience.
Re-construction of the Game Experience Experiment. The idea is that if we change
an interaction and/or a gamiﬁcation tactic to some other, the game experience will still
be concise, but the ﬁnal game will be entirely different.
For example, if we remove the “Change the Thing” interaction and add “Guess
where things will be”, we can come up with a game in which some sensors are ﬁxed
and visible to the player (broadcasting proximity) and others are movable but
untraceable. The players have to ﬁnd (“Find the Thing”) the ﬁxed sensor to receive a
clue about the whereabouts of the movable thing. After that, the player will follow the
clue so than it can reach the movable thing close enough, and by doing that he receives
a point.

A ranking (“Point-based leaderboard”) of the players with most ﬁndings can be
updated daily do that the players can compete with each other (removing the “Improve
user perks” in this case).
With this exercise, we can assess that by changing a few elements of the base
interactions between game elements and the gamiﬁcation tactics employed in the game,
we can drastically change the ﬁnal game experience for the player.

The ContextNet Architecture
Project ContextNet is primarily focused on developing middleware services and APIs
aimed at facilitating the development of large-scale context-aware pervasive and
mobile applications [10]. It is in constant evolution, but it has already been used for the
development of some quite complex distributed mobile applications.7 The code is
freely available for download,8 but not open source. This middleware and its recent
extension for IoT will be used as the basis for developing multiplayer Pervasive IoT
Games.
5.1
The Communication Middleware
ContextNet deﬁnes a high-performance mobile communication middleware, called
Scalable Data Distribution Layer (SDDL) [11]. This middleware connects Stationary
Nodes of a core network (a.k.a., the SDDL Core) with all Mobile Nodes. While the
former are desktops or servers executing in a cluster, or cloud, over the OMG DDS [12]
middleware, the latter are mobile end user devices (i.e. smartphones and tablets).
The
SDDL
communication
protocol
for
inbound-outbound
communication
between the SDDL Core and the mobile nodes is the Mobile Reliable UDP (MR-UDP)
[13]. In a nutshell, MR-UDP is Reliable-UDP with mechanisms for tolerating inter-
mittent connectivity, dynamic IP address changes of the Mobile nodes and reaching
these nodes behind ﬁrewalls/NATs. It is used by the mobile nodes to connect with a
special type of SDDL Core node called Gateway, of which any number can be
deployed in the SDDL Core. Each Gateway maintains one independent MR-UDP
connection with each mobile node, and is responsible for translating application-
messages from MR-UDP to the intra-SDDL core protocol, and, in the opposite
direction, converting core messages to MR-UDP messages and delivering them reliably
to the corresponding mobile nodes.
The SDDL Core has several other specialized nodes (see Fig. 2): the PoA-Manager,
which holds the addresses list of all currently active Gateways and eventually requests
mobile nodes to switch Gateways; GroupDeﬁners evaluate the group-memberships of
all mobile nodes (based on some attribute of their inbound application messages) and

manage the reliable delivery of group-cast messages to the mobiles, and the Controller,
which provides a Map-based user interface to visualize and interact with any mobile
node of the system.
Finally, there is the ClientLib (CNCLib), a Java library which establishes and
manages a MR-UDP connection of a mobile node client (in Java, Android or Lua), and
the Gateways. It hides most MR-UDP details end error handling from the application
layer, and supports application-transparent handover of the mobile node between
SDDL Gateways.
The SDDL has been extensively tested in lab experiments, mainly because we
wanted to test the system with thousands of mobile nodes, and doing such large-scale
tests in with real devices the ﬁeld is not feasible. In our performance tests, we observed
that the Gateways support up to 5000 simultaneous MR-UDP connections each and a
total throughput of 5000 messages/s inbound. However, we have also tested the SDDL
middleware over 2G/3G wireless Internet connections (while the testers roamed
through the city), and obtained good results with respect to latency and message loss.
More details of our performance tests can be found in Sect. 4 of [11].
5.2
SDDL as a Middleware for IoT Games
In the last couple of months, the ContextNet project embraced support for applications
in the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT). Therefore, the SDDL middleware was
extended with the concept of a Mobile Hub (M-Hub) [14, 15]. In IoMT, a “smart thing
or object” can/will be mobile, and is therefore called Mobile Object (M-OBJ). M-OBJs
have short-range wireless communication allowing them to interact with nearby Mobile
Hubs. These M-Hubs are portable devices, such as smartphones, which: (a) have
Fig. 2. Nodes and protocols used in SDDL, as seen in [11].

MR-UDP connectivity with a Gateway of the SDDL Core in the a cloud; (b) have
means of obtaining their current geographic position and (c) have a short-range
wireless communication interface, allowing them to discover, connect and interact with
close M-OBJs.
We plan to use this SDDL middleware extension for IoMT as the basis for our
Pervasive IoT Game, the Area Control Game. Essentially, it will consists of mobile
clients and one or more Game Processing Nodes (GPN), to be deployed in the SDDL
Core. The GPN will be responsible for the long-range communication as it processes
the information passed by the gateways, primarily received from the M-Hubs (Fig. 3).
Besides our Area Control Game case study, we idealized a few examples of per-
fectly implementable IoT Pervasive games using the ContextNet Middleware tech-
nology for mobile nodes communication. Below is the idealized architecture for these
examples summarized:
• Sensor and Token Structures (Mobile Object or M-ObJ)
– They have a UUID9 and some set of attributes.
– They can broadcast and unicast small packets of information to M-Hubs and to
each other (but only through M-Hubs).
– They will most likely use the Bluetooth® LE Technology, but can also use other
types of communication technology, since the GPN is capable of abstracting the
data it receives and pass it forth.
– Most of them will also have some on-board sensors that reveal information of
the object’s current state and environment (e.g. temperature)
– They can have memory, so they can store the information sent by the M-Hubs.
Fig. 3. GPNs computes contextual information from the M-Hubs and M-OBJs, like location.

• Mobile Hubs (M-Hub)
– The smart devices carried by the users. They must be able to “synch” with more
than one M-Obj at the same time.
– They must be capable of mixing information obtained from the Internet with
information obtained from nearby M-Objs.
– They should preferable have access to GPS, as most of the interesting appli-
cations are Location Based, but thats not mandatory.
– They will communicate with other M-Hubs and possibly with a cloud service
through the SDDL Middleware.
– Have much greater storage, processing and battery capacity than M-Objs.
– Acts as the long-haul communication intermediary for M-OBJs in its proximity,
as well as a point of reference.
Also, we just ﬁnished a ﬁrst prototype of M-Hub for Android. This prototype runs on
our Moto E smart phone, which has Bluetooth® Smart and already detects and con-
nects to nearby Bluetooth devices playing the role of a M-OBJ. The M-Hub already
attaches its current GPS coordinate to the M-OBJ’s sensor data, and sends a JSON
message, via MR-UDP whenever it connects or disconnects from the M-OBJ.
We also observed that the discovery and connection times of a M-OBJ to a M-Hub
takes at most 9 s when the Bluetooth Smart connects for the ﬁrst time, but only 300 ms
on all the following connections.

Conclusion
We believe that all technology needed to implement these ideas are already at hand.
This work’s main goal is to organize design patterns, strategies and important features
that should exist in future IoT Pervasive games, so that future developers can properly
use these ideas.
Another objective we have is to show through our case studies how IoT Gaming
can have great social and cultural impact as they can be used to encourage participatory
sensing for urban development, collective action, to report problems (like crackling
sidewalks on urban areas), and urban environment. These can be achieved mainly
through a clever use of both base interactions and gamiﬁcation tactics.
Thus, by showing a few examples of case studies of such games using our Con-
textNet Architecture for IoMT applications, and by analyzing our feedback from the
model validation interview, we are able to conﬁrm that these strategies are capable of
achieving their main goal: to build new engaging pervasive game experiences.

Abstract. This paper discusses the implementation of the pervasive game
PacMap. Openness and portability have been the main design objectives for
PacMap. We elaborate on programming techniques which may be applicable to
a broad range of location-based games that involve the movement of virtual
characters over map interfaces. In particular, we present techniques to execute
shortest path algorithms on spatial environments bypassing the restrictions
imposed by commercial mapping services. Last, we present ways to improve the
movement and enhance the intelligence of virtual characters taking into con-
sideration the actions and position of players in location-based games.

Introduction
Pervasive gaming is an emerging gaming genre that transfers gameplay from the virtual
world to the real environment, leading to the spatial, temporal and social expansion of
the magic circle [1]. The key element in these games is the awareness and incorporation
of user context: depending on the location, environmental or social context the game’s
scenario and the gameplay are adjusted accordingly.
When this genre of games appeared, the use of wearable devices (like sensors and
GPS) was deemed necessary to capture user and environmental context, although the
use of such equipment has been reported to affect the user’s immersion during the
gameplay. The advent of smartphones with their advanced processing, networking and
sensory capabilities overturned the abovementioned restrictions of wearable equipment
and provided pervasive games developers the means for implementing computationally
intensive, context-aware applications commonly incorporating augmented reality.
This paper introduces PacMap, a pervasive variant of the classical game PacMan.
PacMap has been largely inspired by Human PacMan [2], a milestone pervasive game
project released in 2004. From the technology perspective, PacMap makes use of
infrastructure and resources still unavailable at the time that Human PacMan was
protoyped: it uses widely available equipment (like smartphones), 3G or WiFi net-
works, GPS and sensors. Furthermore, our prototype incorporates programming
techniques and principles applicable to a wide range of location-based hunting/chase
games. In particular, the implementation of PacMap aims at creating appealing and

engaging game spaces, allowing anytime/anywhere gameplay, without any need for
orchestration. The game stage is set around the actual location of the user and considers
the actual surrounding road segments as game action ‘corridors’. Moreover, we pro-
pose an implementation that utilizes the high level information granularity inherent in
open map platforms and breaks the dependency on commercial map providers who set
daily/monthly limits on the number of web service invocations. Finally, this paper
suggests techniques for the smooth movement of virtual characters on map-based
interfaces, which should adapt real-time on the actual player movement within the
game space.

Related Work
Location-based games claim a major share in pervasive games market. Many research
prototypes [2–6] as well as some commercial games, like Ingress1 and Zombies Run,2
use location-aware services to support their scenario, having the user’s location as point
of reference.
Human Pacman has been a milestone pervasive game (notably, one of the ﬁrst to
transfer the experience of an arcade game out to the physical world), which largely
inspired the design of PacMap. Using a slightly modiﬁed game plot of the traditional
Pacman, players are enrolled as pacmen, helpers and ghosts. The interaction, as well as
the movement of players within the game space, requires the use of devices, like
sensors and wireless LAN Cards, which are stored in a backpack. The players also
carry head-mounted displays, whereon information about the plot of the game and
augmented reality content are projected. The use of equipment, the need for orches-
tration (helpers) and the difﬁculty to set the game space at any location, seriously limits
the portability and openness of the game.
The evolution of mobile computing (most notably, the emergence of mobile
devices like smartphones, tablets, smart watches, etc.), has radically changed the design
and development of pervasive games. The incorporation of technologies, like GPS,
sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity, compass, barometer, gesture, heart rate,
etc.) and built-in cameras provided game designers and developers the looked-for
machinery to build location-based games with complex and appealing scenarios, and
limited the requirement for specialized supplementary equipment. Notably, latest
research prototypes commonly consume mapping services [5], like Google Maps, as
well as relevant web services (e.g. directions for walking and transit transfers, points of
interest, elevation, trafﬁc and geocoding), which are provided by the service providers
via specialized Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
The use of several among the above mentioned services (e.g. the directions service)
is subject to commercial usage. In practice, this limits the number of monthly invo-
cations under a certain development license. This restriction raises a major challenge
in the design of location-based games which involve heavy use of mapping services

(e.g. chase/hunt games), especially those enrolling intelligent virtual characters and
require execution of path ﬁnding algorithms for virtual hunters.

Game Scenario
The game scenario of PacMap adheres as much as possible to that of the classic arcade
game Pacman. It is a location-based game, which requires Internet connection and
enabled GPS receiver in the device. The game space is determined at startup, con-
sidering the actual road segments around the user’s position as possible walking cor-
ridors for the pacman player. The user is supposed to collect all the cookies positioned
across the streets. Unlike the pacman which us acted by a human player, the enemies
(i.e. the ghosts) are virtual characters handled by the game engine. Similarly to the
original arcade game, the ghosts are supposed to catch pacman, each following a
different mobility pattern moving on the map, around the user’s area. The purple,
orange and blue ghosts execute random movements in the game space. The red ghost
follows the user as the latter moves within the gamespace. Figure 1 illustrates a
snapshot of the PacMap’s gameplay.
4
Game Engine Architecture
PacMap’s system’s architecture adopts a typical client-server model. The server side
part undertakes the fabrication of the game space, whereas the client side visualizes the
game space and enables the interaction among the player and the game engine.
As illustrated in Fig. 2, the client sends out his location information to the game
server in order to create the appropriate game space. The latter is conﬁned by a circle
around the user’s location, with a radius of 200 m. The game server uses the geolo-
cation information to contact a map server and retrieve the nodes and POIs lying within
this imaginary circle (the communication is handled by the OpenStreetMap API3).
Fig. 1. PacMap gameplay screenshots.
3 OpenStreetMap is an open-source mapping service, providing developers with useful crowdsourced
topographical information. Data contributors may register geospatial elements such as nodes and
POIs along the street network. Among others, the OpenStreetMap web services allow exporting the
vertices of rectilinear parts, comprising a road network.

The arrangement of game components within the game space (e.g. the placement of
cookies) is carried out through utilizing the area nodes information. To ensure even
distribution of cookies, the game engine ﬁrstly measures the distance between two
nodes applying the Vincenty’s formulae [7]. The latter is based upon two iterative
methods, which are used in the ﬁeld of Geodesy to measure the distance among two
points on a spherical surface. Subsequently, the road sections are segmented, so that the
cookies can be placed in equal distances.
In addition to nodes, POI information is also utilized in PacMap scenario, as the
user can earn life credits, by reaching some of these POIs (like pharmacies and hos-
pitals), or get “trapped” (e.g. in bar/nightlife areas) wherein the map visibility is
reduced on the device’s screen.
5
PacMap Implementation
The arcade game Pacman involves ghosts which chase the pacman, with their move-
ment promptly adapting to that of pacman. In order to transfer such functionality to a
map-based interface each ghost needs to receive a series of road segments to be
traversed. Provided a start and an end location (e.g. the current location of the ghost and
the player, respectively) a reasonable action for the ghost following the user is to
invoke a ‘direction’ web service typically offered by commercial map data providers
(e.g. the Directions service of the Google Maps API) and then faithfully follow the
shortest path walking directions recommended by the service. However, if the user
location changes too often, direction service invocations (passing the updated ghost/
player location parameters) will increase accordingly and soon exceed the invocations
limit set by commercial providers.
Enemies (i.e. ghosts) movement patterns fall into two types. Orange, blue and
purple ghosts repeatedly execute a random movement around the map. To implement
these movements, we derive two random pairs of coordinates over the arc of the
imaginary circle centered at the user’s current position. These two pairs of coordinates

(representing the start/end nodes of each successive ghost movement) are submitted to
the Directions API service of the map server, thus generating the actual path to be
followed by each ghost. From the games research viewpoint, the movement of the red
ghost is more challenging as it presumably applicable to many alike map/location-
based chase games, since (according to the PacMap scenario) it is supposed to follow
the user as s/he moves within the game space.
Ghosts movement respects the game space topography, namely the nodes exported
from the game server during the game space generation phase (see Fig. 3a). Consid-
ering a graph transformation of the game space (connecting adjacent nodes which are
connected through a road segment on the actual setting and calculating the distances
among them), it is then straightforward to execute a shortest path algorithm to compute
the path to be followed by the user (see Fig. 3b). PacMap’s directions service imple-
ments the Dijkstra’s algorithm,4 wherein edge costs equal the physical distance among
their connected end nodes. For example, the red ghost considers the node nearest to the
ghost’s current location as start node and the node the user currently heads to as end
node (e.g. node B in Fig. 3a).
Shortest paths are derived whenever the user reaches a new edge or turns to another
direction. To ensure prompt adaptation of ghost’s movement to the player’s movement,
the device determines the nodes among which the user is currently located whenever
his location (i.e. GPS ﬁx) is updated.
The sole goal of the ghost is to “catch” pacman, i.e. to reach its currently assigned
end node, having gone through the edge currently traversed by the user. In case that the
ghost arrives at its end node without passing via the player’s edge, the algorithm is
re-executed, with the other end point of that edge set as the new end point for the
requested directions.

for a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path tree.

It is noted that the shortest path algorithm is executed on the client side to eliminate
the effect of network latency inherent in client-server interactions. On an average game
space considering 420 nodes, the algorithm takes 95 ms to yield the shortest path when
executed on a Samsung Galaxy S4 device (processor: ARMv7 – 1.8 GHz × 4 cores/
ram:1.8 GB).

Conclusion
We introduced the prototype pervasive game PacMap, one of the few attempts to
migrate a classical arcade game onto the physical realm. We have proposed pro-
gramming techniques largely applicable to nearly any map-based chase game scenario,
the main objective being to ensure openness and portability. We have also discussed
implementation techniques for path-ﬁnding on real urban settings which bypass the
restrictions imposed by commercial Direction APIs. The use of those techniques
enables programmers and designers to develop location/map-based games, with ﬂex-
ible scenarios that involve intelligent virtual characters dynamically adapting on
players movement behavior during the game.

Abstract. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environments offer a solution to the
challenges of the demographic change by supporting elderly and chronically ill
people inside their own home environments. Serious and pervasive games can
change people’s attitudes and can promote healthy behavior. However, both
concepts are rarely combined and the integration of both concepts is insufﬁ-
ciently explored. We present a user study (n = 64) of an Exergame for AAL
environments with the research foci performance and acceptance. Age is the
predominant factor for performance, while the intention to use is determined by
gaming frequency. Neither technical self-efﬁcacy nor age had considerable
inﬂuence on these measures. However, the interaction with the game had a
considerable positive effect on the participant’s perceived health and pain. The
study shows that Exergames in AAL environments are a viable solution to
support the autonomy and independence of people in an aging society.

Introduction and Related Work
Increased life expectancy in many western countries leads to a demographic change
that will have a tremendous impact on the healthcare system. According to current
predictions, a shrinking working population will have to support a growing number of
retirees: In Europe, the share of people aged 65 years and over is projected to increase
by more than 50 % from 17.1 % in 2008 to 30 % in 2060 [1]. Likewise, the share of
people older than 80 years is projected to triple in the same timeframe. This will stress
the healthcare systems signiﬁcantly as the likelihood of chronic illnesses increases with
age [2]. In contrast, the per capita expenses for healthcare is declining in many western
societies [3]. Accordingly, in the near future less people will contribute to a healthcare
system that more people depend on.
Two solutions alleviate the rising costs of the healthcare systems: First, Ambient
Assisted Living (AAL) technologies that are integrated into the home environments of

elderly, chronically ill, or disabled people. These technologies can assist in several
every day tasks and facilitate a comfortable and independent life in one’s own home
[4, 5]. Second, serious games can change people’s attitudes towards health, can pro-
mote healthy behavior, and can increase physical agility [6–9].
Additionally, it is possible to combine these two solutions as serious games can be
offered in AAL environments. Serious games and particularly Exergames harness the
power of the psychological Premack principle [10]: They interlink physical activities
(which are often perceived as unpleasant) with games (which are usually perceived as
pleasant and entertaining). Speciﬁcally, exercise games require physical activities and
body movements to progress within a game. Still, to unfold the potential positive
effects users must utilize them frequently and on a regular basis. However, the indi-
vidual factors inﬂuencing perceived usability, intention to use, and performance within
serious Exergames in Ambient Assisted Living environments have been insufﬁciently
explored so far. To ﬁll this void, we present a serious game for AAL environments and
a summative user study that detangles the inﬂuence of user factors on performance,
acceptance, and perceived health status.

Game Concept and Development
The exercise game is designed to ﬁt into our Ambient Assisted Living room that is
designed as a research space to understand if and under which conditions users would
adopt ambient assisted technology [11]. The room is a simulacrum of a comfortable
25 m2 living room, with a large window, two couches, and two bookshelves, that is
transparently augmented by several input and output devices such as a sensory ﬂoor for
detecting falls, a Kinect-based movement and gesture detection system, and an infrared
camera to check the inhabitant’s health status. Also, the room is furnished with a wall-
sized multi-touch display (4.8 × 2.4 m2, see [12]).
The game itself is situated in a virtual garden environment that is presented on the
large wall (see Fig. 1). The user’s task is to pass through a series of consecutive levels
with increasing complexity in which he or she collects different fruits and vegetables by
performing different gestures with his or her body. A Microsoft Kinect™sensor tracks
the user’s movements and the game evaluates whether the gestures are performed
correctly. For example, in the ﬁrst level the user’s task is to pick apples from a tree by
raising one arm. In the following level, another type of fruit and movement are added,
in this case pears that require a grab and hold gesture. All required gestures within the
game were developed in cooperation with medical professionals (orthopedists and ergo
therapists) to ensure that essential and often neglected body movements are exercised
during the game [6, 13].
A previous study evaluated an initial prototype of the game with 71 participants
(between 20 and 86 years of age) in a doctor’s ofﬁce [6]. Although the performance
within the game was much higher for younger users, users from all ages liked the game
and expressed the wish to use it frequently. While interacting with the game increased
the perceived physical exertion, the perceived pain levels decreased.
The second prototype was reﬁned to reﬂect the user’s feedback from the initial user
study and was then integrated into the Ambient Assisted Living room (see Fig. 1).

The following section describes the user study that was carried out to evaluate the
second iteration of the game prototype.

Method
The exploratory study investigates how older adults interact with the exercise game
integrated in the ambient assisted home environment and addresses three main research
questions: First, what user factors contribute to performance within the Exergame?
Second, which factors explain the intention to use the game? Third, has the game an
impact on the perceived health of the users?
Procedure: The participants played the ﬁrst three levels of the game in RWTH Aachen
University’s ambient assisted living lab (eHealth lab). Each of the three levels lasted
120 s. Before the interaction with the game a survey assessed the explanatory variables.
After the game the subjective preferences regarding the game were measured. Log ﬁles
captured the participants’ performance within the game.
Explanatory variables (control variables) for modeling user factors were self-efﬁcacy in
interacting with technology (SET), need for achievement (NArch), gaming frequency
(GF), gender, and age. Self-efﬁcacy in interaction with technology [14] explains large
portions of effectivity, efﬁciency, and user-satisfaction in interaction with information
and communication technology and plays a mayor role for elderly interacting with
technology [15]. Gaming frequency is measured as the average playing frequency of
games (card, board, and movement games with and without computers). Need for
achievement measures the desire to reach difﬁcult and distant goals in domains such as
sports or in the job [16]. The inclination towards games might transfer towards the
movement games and people with high need for achievement might feel incited by the
game.

Depended variables were performance within the game (measured as average number
of fruits/vegetables collected in the ﬁrst three levels), perceived pain and perceived
exertion (difference before and after using the game), as well as behavioral intention
(BI) from the Uniﬁed Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model
[17] as the intention to use such a game in the future. The UTAUT2 model explains the
adoption of technology depending on a set of promoting and hindering factors. Per-
ceived exertion is measured before and after the game on a reduced Borg scale [18].
The scale is subjective, yet it correlates strongly with the heart rate (r > .8).
Except for in-game performance, all variables are surveyed on 6-point Likert
scales. The data is analyzed using χ2-tests, univariate analyses of variance with repe-
ated-measures (repeated-measures ANOVA), and stepwise multiple linear regressions.
Type I error rate (level of signiﬁcance) is set to α = .05. Type II error rate (power) is set
to (1 −β) = .8. For linear regressions only valid models with no or moderate VIF are
reported. The explained variance is reported as corrected r2-values.
In total, 64 people have participated in the study (32 male, 32 female). The age of
the participants ranged from 17 to 85 years (M = 43.2, σ = 19.6). 26 % reported chronic
illnesses, mainly asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, but also depressions. To
analyze age-related effects with factorial methods, the sample was divided into the
groups young (M = 25.7, σ = 4.5) and old (M = 60.6, σ = 11.4). Gender was equally
distributed among both age groups (χ2(1, N = 64) = .250, p = .617 > .05, n.s.).
4
Results
The results are presented as follows: First, the determinants for performance are
reported. Second, the factors explaining the behavioral intention are presented. Finally,
the effect of the game on perceived pain and exertion are shown.
4.1
Determinants for Performance
To identify factors explaining performance, a multiple regression analysis with the
dependent variable performance and the independent variables age, gaming frequency,
need for achievement, perceived pain, and self-efﬁcacy in interacting with technology
was carried out. The regression yielded three signiﬁcant models: The ﬁrst model, with
the factor age, explains r2 = .508 (50 %) of the variance in performance (F(1,
57) = 58.960, p < .01). The second model (Age + NArch) explains an additional 5 %
(r2 = .559) of the performance (F(2, 56) = 37.819, p < .01). The third and last model
(Age + NArch + Gender) contributes an extra 4 % (r2 = .605, F(3, 55) = 30.671,
p < .01).
4.2
Determinants for Usage Intention (Behavioral Intention)
In addition to the previous set of independent variables, the users’ average performance
is considered in the regression model for behavioral intention (BI) from the UTAUT2
model. This regression yielded two signiﬁcant models: The ﬁrst, with the single factor
148
P. Brauner and M. Zieﬂe

gaming frequency, explains r2 = .206 (20 %) of the BI (F(1, 57) = 16.059, p < .01). The
second model, with gaming frequency and performance, explains an additional 6 %
(r2 = .257, F(2, 56) = 11.041, p < .01) of the BI.
4.3
Effect on Perceived Exertion and Perceived Pain
While the levels of perceived exertion increased signiﬁcantly during the experiment
(F(1, 62) = 14.571, p < .001, η2 = .190), the levels of perceived pain decreased (F(1,
62) = 118.543, p < .001, η2 = .230). For both measures a signiﬁcant interaction with
age is observed. (Exertion: F(1, 62) = 7.215, p = .009, η2 = .104, Pain: F(1, 62) =
6.322, p = .025, η2 = .093). Speciﬁcally, younger users reported higher levels of
perceived exertion while older users reported stronger reductions in their perceived
pain levels (see Fig. 2, left and right).
5
Discussion
The results of the user study ﬁt well into the current research landscape. The study
afﬁrmed that age is the strongest predictor for performance within the game and that
psychomotoric performance decreases with age. The remarkable revelation, however,
is that no other personality factor has a considerable inﬂuence on performance. Game
performance is only weakly affected by need for achievement and gender. Additionally,
neither gaming frequency nor self-efﬁcacy in interacting with technology has an
inﬂuence on performance. The intention to use the serious game (Behavioral Intention)
is inﬂuenced only by the current gaming frequency of the participants. This ﬁnding has
both negative and positive aspects that need to be addressed in future research: On the
negative side, the game seems to be only attractive to people who are already inclined
to gaming and who play games on a regular basis. Therefore, people unattached to
games might not use Exergames in ambient assisted living environments. They cannot
proﬁt from the beneﬁts of these and have to ﬁnd other ways to sustain their physical
ﬁtness. On the positive side, the intention to use Exergames in ambient assisted living
environments is neither affected by age, need for achievement, nor by self-efﬁcacy in
interacting with technology. Consequently, Exergames seem to be a ubiquitous solu-
tion to increase the physical ﬁtness of people living in AAL environments, at least if
they like to play games.

Most importantly, even the short interaction with the Exergame motivated our test
users to vigorously engage in physical activity. The short-term effect was a reduced
perceived pain (especially for elderly) while a possible long-term effect might be the
prevention of a rise of cardio-vascular diseases in elderly.

Abstract. The demographic change that is foreseeable in the future will
permeate all throughout society, and require new approaches to ageing and its
concomitant challenges. Serious games are one of the answers towards this
challenge. Herein, we describe ways how the SafeMove project plans to employ
serious games in the context of helping elderly people with light dementia to
operate on their own. Due to the multi-facetted approach of the SafeMove
project, serious games are embedded in a holistic system for the elderly, which
will ultimately help them stay active and ambulatory as long as possible, while
feeling safe and well cared for. This will enable them to stay in the comfort of
their own homes for as long as possible, while helping them stay active and
socially connected. The serious games will provide the impetus to exercise
more, as well as connect with others playing the same games.

Overview
By 2020, 25 % of the EU’s population will be older than 65 years, which will lead to a
shrinking of the European working-age population. This demographic and ﬁnancial
shift will increase the cost of the healthcare systems, as more people will need some
sort of physical, social or mental care allowing them to remain an integrated and active
part of society. One of the key factors, which enables a person to remain an active
member of society and enjoy a high quality of living is the ability to freely, safely and
easily travel from point to point. This ability becomes less available to people as they
grow old and the capability to remain active and to maintain a high level of well-being
becomes compromised.
There are many reasons, both physical and cognitive, why elderly people become
reluctant or unable to travel or even take a walk. This lack of movement and motivation
leads to social isolation and to an excessive need for personal care.

The SafeMove project vision is to enable elderly people with amnestic Mild
Cognitive Impairment – (aMCI, i.e. light dementia) to stay active and in the
comfort of their own homes for a longer period of time, while simultaneously
being able to go out and to join social activities. The project aims to achieve this
vision by assisting them to become well trained users of modern IT devices and by
creating both a physical and a virtual community.
SafeMove aims to reach its goals by creating an integrative and personalised system
comprised of three key synergetic elements:
1. SafeMove@Home: Home-based physical and cognitive training, also through
serious games. IT training games and devices (based on the Kinect sensor) are being
developed to enhance both the mental and physical ﬁtness of the elderly in an
interactive, effective and enjoyable way: The system allows the users to practice
their outdoor routes at home, play serious games (that are being developed based on
professional knowledge from various clinical researches on dementia). The system
also addresses the development of social relationships by encouraging contact
between users.
2. SafeMove on Tour: Location-based mobile assistance for outdoor life activities.
An application for mobile devices is being developed in order to support elderly
persons with aMCI to ﬁnd their way outside their homes, navigate through public
trafﬁc or at social events etc. By using the real-time assistance provided by their
mobile devices, they remember daily life routines such as dressing themselves
according to the weather conditions, taking the keys with them when leaving the
house or even making sure they’re still on the route they planned in advance.
3. SafeMove Assist: Caregivers and family members have the opportunity to assess
the health of their clients remotely and to support them in keeping them healthy and
mobile. With the help of the SafeMove assist platform, caregivers receive valuable
information concerning the users and are able to assist several users simultaneously.
The SafeMove project is funded by the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) Joint Pro-
gramme and is carried out by a collaborative interdisciplinary group of experts working
including physicians, scientists, consultants, designers, health-care providers etc.

SafeMove Games
The games for the SafeMove project are being developed to inspire conﬁdence in the
user’s physical and mental abilities.
Using the gesture based Microsoft Kinect, the elderly can play fun and challenging
mini-games to keep their faculties sharp, interact with peers and enjoy gentle guided
exercise all while in the safety of their own home.
It is our hope that these features will not replace their trips outdoors but that it
would encourage them to be strong and conﬁdent when going out, preventing their
lifestyle from declining and giving them the courage to keep going in the event of a fall
or other troubling event.
152
I.L. Madar et al.

The games will all be set in one environment, a park, where the user will be able to
explore and launch mini-games which are each designed around Physical, Cognitive
and Social elements.
Physical, Cognitive and Social elements are not mutually exclusive and we expect a
signiﬁcant amount of cross over in the mini games.
The combined activities are designed to provide a holistic approach to improving
social interaction skills, providing an awareness of social skills and improve conﬁdence
and promote a feeling of wellbeing.
The mini-games which have so far been developed for the SafeMove project
include:
Walking in a Virtual Park
This is a simple physical game which uses a walking gesture. This game is designed to
give the users gentle and guided exercise.
Hoopla
The user is faced with 3 colour posts in the ground at the same distance away. The
colours are Red, Blue and Yellow. The user will be given hoops to throw to these posts.
There will be a tombola sign which spins around and will have one of the 3 colours
written on it but it may be displayed in a different colour. For example, the word says
RED but it is written in blue. The user must then throw the hoop to the blue post. So
the user must throw the hoop at the correct post according to the colour of the word and
not the word itself.
This game is a variant of the classic Stroop Test. Dissonance between the colour
presented and the mismatched name interferes with naming the colour. The Stroop Test
causes elevated activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is involved in
detecting the incongruity. The classic Stroop interference task [3] has provided a
SafeMove −Safe Mobility of Elderly in the Vicinity of Their Home
153
www.ebook3000.com

fruitful platform by which to test models of forced-choice decision and response
selection under situations where compatible or incompatible components of the stim-
ulus facilitate or impair task performance. In the typical Stroop task, participants are
instructed to report the physical colour of a written colour word (e.g., “RED”), while
ignoring the semantic meaning of the word. In cases where the physical colour of the
presentation is congruent with the semantic meaning of the word, participants are both
faster and more accurate at reporting the physical colour. However, when the physical
colour differs from the semantic meaning of the word (i.e., is incongruent) participants
are slower and more prone to error [2].
Golf
This is game is to help improve spatial memory. The user has to use a golf swing
gesture to put the ball into play. They are then shown a view of the fairway with the
golf ball displayed. The ball then disappears and a few distractors are displayed. The
user then has to remember and select where the golf ball was displayed.
The spatial span task exercises your visuospatial working memory; the component
of working memory that allows you to temporarily hold and manipulate information
about places. Many everyday activities involve visuospatial working memory,
including ﬁnding your way around your environment, judging the position of other
motorists while you are driving and searching for your keys. According to one very
inﬂuential cognitive model of working memory [1] visuospatial working memory
depends on a specialised sub-component of the working memory system. This is
referred to as the “visuospatial sketchpad” and is thought to have a visual “cache”,
responsible for storing visual form and colour information, and an “inner scribe” which
deals with spatial and movement information.
154
I.L. Madar et al.

Smiling
This is a social cognition game. The user will see a series of smiling, neutral and
frowning faces and they have to select the smiling faces as quickly as possible. The
idea is that each time the user drags their attention away from one of the frowning faces
in order to ﬁnd a smiling, accepting face, it helps to build a mental habit. The next time
they are reminded of a rejection or criticism from someone else, rather than dwelling on
it, they may be able to ‘let it go’. This is because the mental habit generalizes beyond
the visual domain of disengaging from frowning faces, to apply to disengaging from
thoughts and worries about social rejection and criticism.

For all of the games we will measure the user reaction times, the accuracy and each
game will have a scoring system. This will enable the SafeMove system to track user
progress and help to identify a decline in the user’s physical and cognitive abilities.

Beneﬁts of Conference Participation
The core innovative component of the SafeMove solution is our ability to seamlessly
integrate the 3 elements described above into a holistic solution that is based on
clinical research and can provide customized and effective assistance for elderly
people, at home and on tour, thus creating a solution that will signiﬁcantly
improve their well-being.
During the conference, we would like to present the innovative concept of the
SafeMove solution and demonstrate key components and features that were already
developed, emphasizing the serious games component. We are sure that in the project’s
present state (2 years out of 3), the knowledge we are able to convey would be
beneﬁcial to other participating consortia.
As the representatives of the SafeMove consortium, we look forward to receiving
new ideas and best practices concerning technological integration and development of
serious games for the elderly population.

Abstract. Chronic diseases are becoming the world’s leading causes of death and
disability, and are predicted to account for almost three quarters of all deaths by
2020. A working prototype was built to capture vital signs for the elderly staying at
home and deliver prompt care remotely by using wearable ECG wireless sensors.
This prototype has been tested to capture data on a 24/7 basis for a number of
patients at the KFUPM Medical Center. The developed system includes a suit of
signal processing algorithms for the detection of severe cases of arrhythmias in
elderly patients. After identifying patients with potential arrhythmia variability, an
alarm system sends emergency requests to caregivers for immediate response. Our
results were benchmarked against the standard MIT physiobank. The performance
of the system was also tested on simulated data with very satisfactory results, and
very positive feedback from users and medical practitioners.

Introduction
During the last few years we have witnessed an increasing interest in wearable/mobile
health monitoring devices, both in research and industry. These devices are particularly
important to the world’s increasingly aging population, whose health has to be assessed
regularly or monitored continuously. Chronic diseases are becoming the world’s
leading causes of death and disability, and are predicted to account for almost three
quarters of all deaths by 2020 [1].
Traditionally, part of the difﬁculty in achieving equitable access to healthcare has
been the required presence of the patient at the Medical Center. Recent advances in
information and communication technologies, in addition to wearable computing
technologies, have created unprecedented opportunities for overcoming this. This is
possible by increasing the number of ways that healthcare can be delivered. Telehealth,
the area where medicine, information, and telecommunications technology meet, is
probably the part of this revolution with the greatest impact on healthcare delivery.
A telehealth system can be deﬁned as the delivery of medical information over a
distance by using telecommunication means. Home telehealth, on the other hand
involves the use of telehealth techniques in a non-institutional setting such as home, or
in an assisted-living facility. In store-and-forward telehealth, vital signs and clinical
data are captured and stored, then sent to caregivers for further analysis. Physiological
monitoring leads to richer data and therefore to improved decision making [2, 3].

Recently, there has been a growing awareness of the need for new ways to improve
the well-being of older people at home as well as the availability of increasingly
affordable technology and computational power. Nevertheless, consumer and clinician
adoption and acceptance have been slow. For example, social alarms or personal
emergency response systems (PERS) enable a person to call for help in the event of an
accident (e.g. fall) or other problem. Services like using a wireless pendant or wearable
bracelet connect the older person to a call center, which then notiﬁes ambulance
services and family members in the event of an emergency [4]. The usual clinical or
hospital monitoring of physiological events such as electrocardiogram or blood pres-
sure provides only a brief window on physiology of a patient. It usually fails to capture
rare events during sleep times, while it performs well during daily life activities.
Therefore, there is a vast need for acquiring and adopting wearable telehealth solutions
for the long run.
The implications of wearable health monitoring technologies are paramount, since
they could: (1) enable the detection of early signs of health problems; (2) notify
healthcare providers in critical situations; (3) ﬁnd correlations between lifestyle and
health; (4) bring healthcare to remote locations and developing countries, and help
doctors and researchers with accessing multi-sourced real-time physiological data [5].
With the advent of advanced telecommunication technology, long-term home care of
the elderly or what we call telehealth is becoming a rapidly growing area of healthcare
industry. Lately, many researchers have begun investing their time into the research of
wireless telehealth systems. Proponents of wireless systems claim that the increased
mobility and the lower cost of the systems are highly beneﬁcial to telehealth. Mobility
and lower cost healthcare solutions are beneﬁts of new telecommunications technol-
ogies. [6]. Telehealth has the potential of improving the quality of delivered health
services and reducing total healthcare costs by avoiding unnecessary hospitalisations
and ensuring the fast delivery of healthcare. In addition to cost-effective telehealth,
remote health monitoring can signiﬁcantly contribute to the enhancement of disease
prevention, early diagnosis, disease management, treatment and home rehabilitation
[7, 8]. This paper presents a novel approach to affordable mobile telehealth infra-
structure for the purpose of arrhythmia early detection in KFUPM for patients to satisfy
the vast need for the telehealth solution in Saudi Arabia . The paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 describes the proposed system architecture. Section 3 presents the
ECG Graphical user interface used by the elderly. Section 4 presents the Wavelet
transform approach or algorithm for arrhythmia analysis.

Proposed System Architecture
In the following section, system architecture for telehealth is developed. We propose an
architectural telehealth solution for the elderly living at home. The elderly might be
handicapped in various ways, as senses and capabilities to remember are not always
good. Also relatives, who might be spread all over the world, would like to make sure
that loved ones are all right and perhaps keep an eye on them 24/7. The elderly may not
able to see a physician anytime they need, because they may be unable to make their
way to the clinic or hospital. Therefore, a solution must be developed to allow the
160

elderly to talk to their physicians in a user-friendly manner. The physicians must have a
remote-view of the vital signs that they look at, like electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen
saturation, blood pressure, heart rate, etc. In case of emergency, a reliable emergency
system must call a physician and ambulance for help. We have integrated a portable
ECG sensor with a Bluetooth interface, called Alive ECG, into the proposed Telehealth
system. A number of sample ECG data were captured from 30 volunteers between the
ages of 20 and 23, in addition to a couple of elderly patients suffering from arrhythmia
using the alive ECG sensor and sent through Bluetooth to a PC for further analysis. The
ECG data captured is compared on the spot with normal ECG stored in a local database
server to detect any abnormalities. The R-R interval in a typical ECG sample is the time
taken to conduct electrical discharge spread through different parts of the heart. Any
deviation of the R-R interval from its normal range can indicate the onset of arrhythmia
and hence requires immediate intervention by specialists. Figure 1 shows an overview
of the general layout of the proposed Telehealth monitoring system for the elderly
using an IP digital camera and the web, in addition to a GSM modem for sending
emergency messages or calls to the physician as well as to the ambulance. The database
is used to store the information related to the health status of the elderly to be analyzed
by a physician or caregiver. The layout shown in Fig. 1 has been built and tested in the
lab for the purpose of using it as a ubiquitous Telehealth solution for home use. It also
includes a smart card access control interface for securing access to critical medical
information. Changes in an individual’s daily routine often signal onset of illness and
potentially cognitive decline.
The focus in this paper is on a Telehealth monitoring system for the elderly at
home, which can also be used to monitor the elderly at the hospital. To make this
possible, the biosensors capturing the vital signs are programmed to communicate with
a centralized station using Ad hoc network or even wireless infrastructure LAN. The
medical wearable sensors capture the vital signs of the elderly and send these vital signs

upon request to the physician. The proposed Telehealth system has been successfully
tested for sending high and low blood pressure alarms remotely via SMS. The system
was tested in the lab for sending blood pressure and pulse rate values to a central
database server. Records of the elderly’s vital signs measurements, including the ECG
(Electrocardiogram) measurements are stored on the local home server for future use.
A scenario of how the system is used is that a patient suffering from arrhythmia wears
the Bluetooth enabled portable ECG, shown in Fig. 2 and runs his daily life activities
for a week or so. If the patient feels unwell, he presses a button and his ECG data is
sent immediately to his doctor for examining. While at the clinic, the doctor meets the
patient for closer testing. See Fig. 3.

ECG GUI
The application consists of two main GUI interfaces. One is called ECG SYSTEM and
the other is called PATIENT.
The ECG system has the following functions:
• Fetch the data.
• Compare the collected data with the data saved in the server.
• Store the collected data into the SQL server.
• E-mail emergency notiﬁcations.
The ECG system captures data generated from MATLAB after specifying the patient
ID and presents it on the screen. After that, the program compares the data fetched
against some default values to ﬁnd out the abnormalities. If an abnormality is detected,
the application sends a message via OUTLOOK to the medical center specifying the
patient ID. See Fig. 4.
4
Wavelet Transform Approach
Another effective approach learned from literature was using the wavelet transform
approach as follows. Using the LABVIEW ASPT (Advanced Signal processing
Toolkit), WA detrend VI, the low frequency trend of the signal can be removed. We
used daubechies6 (db06) wavelet which is similar to the real ECG signal for removing
the trend.
Prior to the capturing an actual ECG signal, National Instruments software LAB-
VIEW was used for the simulation and analysis of the ECG signal. For this purpose,
Simulate ECG LABVIEW palette was used as shown below. Using the simulate ECG
signal, a lot of parameters could be controlled like the beats per minutes (bpm), P-QRS
delay, QRS-T delay, amplitude of ECG, number of samples etc. Also, three different
scenarios could be selected from Atrial Tachycardia, Hyperkalemia and normal ECG
signal. To this simulated ECG, white Gaussian noise was added programmatically with
a controlled signal to noise ratio as seen from the block diagram of the below vi. Finally
results were stored in a LABVIEW measurement ﬁle for further analysis. See Fig. 5.
See Fig. 6 for using Wavelet algorithm to ﬁlter the noisy ECG with LABVIEW.

Discussion
The system will also open new opportunities for further research in the area of
biomedical signal and image processing. Rapid development of Telehealth technology
will also motivate health centers and hospitals to adopt the infrastructure and neces-
sary skills to provide better & efﬁcient medical treatment for patients to boost the
quality of life.
The use of Telehealth will provide higher-quality service and increased efﬁciency to
the practice of medicine. Emergency and critical response professionals can be given
immediate access to a wealth of vital information, particularly for the elderly and
disabled. It also becomes possible to observe and deliver care to patients while living in
their homes, instead of spending months or even years in the hospital. With the
development of new products from Telehealth, there is a growing need to develop
standards for the ﬁeld. Standards will improve reliability and allow the interoperability
of the various different services being created. The proposed design represents a good
approach to research in Telehealth for the elderly, keeping in mind that many things
have been generalized to a certain extent and the analysis of the vital sign data captured
from the medical sensors is still an on- going research. Certain crucial issues still
have to be resolved regarding the user-friendliness of the Telehealth system and how
the elderly will interact with all of this complex technology. In addition to that, some
measures have to be taken to ensure the privacy of the web enabled solution which

164

physicians use to view the health status of the elderly since the web is vulnerable to
hackers. The proposed design has been kept under closed application for a relatively
small environment to cut down design cost and simplify the testing methodology.
Research is also ongoing to support the automatic self-diagnosis feature of the Tele-
health system regarding reliable detection of cardiac diseases symptoms.

Conclusion
LABVIEW along with Vernier sensors were used to successfully capture an ECG
signal from individuals out of the 30 student’s participants, after which ECG signal was
ﬁltered using wavelet transform approach. Finally, Heart rate (R-R) and QRS complex
of the ECG signal was successfully analyzed from the ﬁltered signal. Further analysis
of detecting the p-wave and t-wave is underway which will help us detecting
arrhythmia later.
A graphical user interface (GUI) based Telehealth system has been developed using
LABVIEW instrumentation software. The purpose of the developed system is real time
analysis of the vital signs captured from the elderly suffering from arrhythmia. The
MATLAB & LABVIEW simulation results were used to validate the real data captured
from volunteers using ECG sensors. The successful implementation and utilization of
the wireless ECG system in the KFUPM Medical Center has paved the way for
establishing a ubiquitous mobile Telehealth which proved to be a cost effective solution
for patients suffering from severe arrhythmia. The deployed system provides big hope
for patients with chronic diseases and it could therefore help avoid catastrophic results
in the future by providing immediat medical care in the ﬁeld. The real-time analysis
and feature extraction algorithms implemented in LABVIEW, in conjunction with the
ALIVE wireless ECG will enable physicians to use the system by delivering better
emergency care.

Contribution to IoT for Healthcare

Introduction to BIM in the Healthcare Typology
This paper aims to introduce the IoT community of scientists and technical researches
to the concepts integral to BIM and the Architectural design process in large scale
healthcare projects. In particular, this paper puts forward the potential for BIM database
systems to be used as primary sources of building information and locational data for
IoT systems, and makes suggestions about further studies.
1.1
The Room as the Architect’s Base Product
We generally think of Architects as creators of buildings, but the building is, in fact, a
conglomeration of individual rooms, each designed to fulﬁll a speciﬁc function for the
users and owners. Architects will often begin healthcare projects with lists of room
types that must be designed and detailed.
Rooms have requirements. In the healthcare space, rooms have requirements such
as hygiene class, security level, acoustics, radiation shielding etc. Through the work of
designing hospitals, Architects will create relationships between room objects,
according to functional neighborhoods, or departments such as Acute Care, Operation,
or Intensive Care. We group these departments together into user-friendly buildings
and wrap it all in a pleasing and functional aesthetic shell. Architects combine art,
healing spaces, protection, heating/cooling, logistical ﬂows, people ﬂows, and many
other aspects together the ﬁnal buildings, but we always return to the room.
Healthcare projects, in particular, are amongst the most complex building types for
an Architect to design. Hospitals have high information density and complexity of
function, logistics, equipment, and staff. To give a sense of scale, a recent large-scale
hospital in Stockholm comprises of 300,000 + sq meters of new hospital, including
11,000 + rooms, and over 300,000 pieces of equipment or furnishings. A more typical
new hospital may hover around 50,000 sq meters, with over 2,000 rooms and 50,000
distinct facility assets to keep track of. Each object may also have 20 + columns of
parametric data to fully identify the instance or type. Add it all up, and we are rapidly
approaching big data scale.
To organize this complexity, current Architectural best practice is to use specialized,
spatial, relational database systems; the Building Information Model. Popular platforms
include Autodesk’s Revit and Graphisoft’s Archicad, for example. The Building
Information Model combines 2-D/3-D visualization, document creation/management,

information management, object creation/management and design ﬂexibility into a
single visual database system, or BIM. In practice, for larger or more complex facilities,
Architects will network multiple BIM databases together, each having speciﬁc purposes;
for example, façade, structure, base-building, mechanical-electrical-plumbing etc. In
current best practice we also provision additional custom databases to mediate speciﬁc
information types across the entire BIM network; for example, change management,
room requirements, or equipment/furnishing speciﬁcations.
Through it all, Architects always deal with objects, whether those objects are
rooms, building parts, doors, MR scanners, or electrical sockets. All objects are
uniquely identiﬁed via a GUID, or another custom identity code. All objects can
thereby be traced through the BIM network for quantity surveying and cost estimation.
These objects are all parametric, portable, and reproducible across the BIM network.
The preceding description is to introduce that Architects now design healthcare
projects in a data rich environment. Some ﬁrms push the state-of-the-art, while others
are slowly pulled along by the evolution of the industry.
1.2
So What Happens to All This Information?
Traditionally, the Architectural design is focused on the production, or construction, of
the new or improved healthcare facility. Drawings and documents on paper or .pdf are
the traditional deliverables to our clients. A subset of the design data is preserved as a
record-keeping reference. Despite the dynamic and rich information design environ-
ment of BIM, many clients and Architectural ﬁrms deliver information as static and
barren analogue formats. When the facility or hospital is built, the design documents
are put away on dusty shelves.
Increasingly, however, regional healthcare agencies or healthcare developers have
adopted a more datacentric model. More complex and high-tech facilities have shifted
the production of healthcare facilities away from static documents towards dynamic
information structures. Architectural ﬁrms by necessity must meet the demands of their
evolving clients, and in many cases Architects are leading their clients towards more
efﬁcient and useful information management techniques.
The datacentric design is further complemented by the operations and maintenance
specialists, structural consultants, plumbing and electrical consultants, security spe-
cialist and many others. The design data ﬂows much deeper beyond production and
into the life of the healthcare facility. New deliverables include the BIM models,
specialized databases, and sharepoints, in addition to the dusty drawings, documents
and static.pdfs. Many of these deliverables are used in real-time, and are accessible in
mobile formats. See Fig. 1 in the afterword.
There exists, therefore, a rich well of information upon which IoT for Healthcare
can draw.
1.3
How to Draw from the Well
Each BIM platform has its own proprietary format which is generally obtuse. The
industry standard for sharing BIM data among design professionals is the .ifc format,
168
S. Rowland
www.ebook3000.com

or Industry Foundation Class, which is maintained and developed by the Building
Smart organization. The .ifc is usable across a wide variety of design, analysis, and
facilities management software platforms. It is becoming an ofﬁcial International
Standard ISO/IS 16739, and the newest version includes a more robust XML inter-
change ability. The.ifc is an open format, and the complete speciﬁcations are available
for anyone to view.
Fortunately, the major BIM platforms also have maturing APIs in C#, VB.net, and
other supported ﬂavors. Custom and creative tools are built on top of the BIM platform.
The trend is to use the BIM platform as the primary tool during the design process, and
extract the BIM data to an open database SQL or noSQL for a wider array of non-
production uses. The APIs are well supported, and allow ﬂexible and creative man-
agement of BIM data and data ﬂows.
1.4
A Word of Caution
As a whole, the construction and development industry moves very slowly towards
adopting new technologies. Some of the larger players are leading the way towards
exploiting the data density of healthcare projects, but many others are happy to con-
tinue with analogue or thin data processes. Forward-looking professionals are able to
demonstrate the advantages of managing healthcare design complexity with deeper
integration of datacentric methodologies.
1.5
Where Does IoT Come into the Picture?
Let’s go back to the room. The room object is a unique entity, comprising of a relative
location, a spatial quantity, and a variety of requirements that are described as distinct
parameters. Location data can be GPS speciﬁc, but is often relative to a regional x,y,z
base point. Placing it in a global positioning system, however, is trivial. Spatial
quantities can be in terms of volume, areas, and can be measured together into larger
grouped volumes and areas. Within and around the room object are building parts,
ﬁnishes, moveable equipment, ﬁxed furnishings, and people. Furthermore, each room
object exists in relation to other room objects, building parts, things, as well as the
building or facility as a whole.
Each IoT node is embedded in this web of relationships and the things that com-
prise and reside therein. Within the ﬁnished building, objects are asset-coded and
tagged via nfc tags, rﬁd tags, QR code stickers or bar-codes and referenced back to
facilities management systems. Often this is a manual process of identifying, tagging
and scanning, but increasingly manufacturers are delivering custom tagged materials,
furnishings and equipment according to the BIM data. This is ambient level data, and
does not rise to the level of IoT ambitions, however it can be accessed as a data
environment via scanning technologies.
As IoT matures in the built environment, the BIM data can be fed to the node and
backed by a persistent Building Information data structure. The location and relational

information provide a valuable basis for the IoT systems. The information ﬂow from
design to living building becomes much more complete and evolved.
1.6
Sounds Great! What’s the Catch?
The catch is providing a standardized data and delivery system. The Building Infor-
mation data structure can and probably should be a cloud-based information store to
alleviate the necessity for hospital and building organizations to maintain the IT
infrastructure. Collecting and maintaining the design data will need to be organized as a
standard building design process. New deliverables will need to be speciﬁed and
detailed at the beginning of the design process, when healthcare developers are hiring
design professionals. Further studies will need to delve into the legal and professional
implications of adding new deliverables to the architect’s basic services. Return on
Investment will need to be studied in detail to motivate healthcare organizations to
develop towards IoT applications.
Other complications are more familiar: security, privacy, and maintenance. Security
is a serious concern for healthcare facilities. IoT enabled equipment requires a high
level of security. Healthcare facilities require very high reliability for all equipment,
systems and building components.
• Equipment including cloud and mobile apps, require strong password and
permissions.
• Equipment must not collect data that violates patient privacy.
• Equipment must encrypt communications and software updates.
• Equipment requires secure Web interfaces where applicable.
• The Building Information Data must be maintained and updated.
Perhaps the biggest challenge is proving conclusively that IoT for Healthcare
provides a compelling advantage for healthcare facilities. The status quo is a powerful
force, and healthcare developers and authorities have many bigger priorities; for
example, providing a healthy and healing environment for patients. Further studies will
need to explore and demonstrate the beneﬁts of IoT for healthcare for various stake-
holders and participants; for example doctors, patients, visitors technicians, adminis-
trators etc.

Pointing Forward
2.1
Afterword and the Datacentric Organisation Model
I am reminded of the early days of the internet, when the web was a barren place.
Content creation was a priority, back in the day before everybody had their own blog.
IoT for Healthcare has a major advantage, in that the healthcare design process creates
a large volume of very useful content. Architects have felt for years that the BIM data
was being underutilized and undervalued beyond the building process. IoT is an
opportunity to use this content towards its potential.

The Datacentric Organisation shown below is descriptive of the current best
practice of healthcare design in major Scandanavian markets. Specialized design dat-
abases (DB) sit at the apex, ﬁltering and mediating information through the BIM
models. In practice, this tends to be a weblike network, but the hierarchy is generally
correct. IoT systems can overlap at several levels, especially in the lower tiers.

Abstract. This paper presents a system that exploits the synergy
between wearable/mobile technology and smart caring environments to
support caregivers in Assisted Living Facilities (ALFs) for persons with
physical and cognitive disabilities. In particular, this healthcare support
system allows caregivers to be automatically alerted of potentially haz-
ardous situations that happen to the inhabitants while these are alone.
The design stemmed from six system requirements derived from the
results of three focus groups conducted with 30 caregivers of diﬀerent
ALFs in Northern Italy.

Introduction
Ambient assisted living (AAL) and general healthcare support systems have
mainly focused on improving the quality of life for people (especially the elderly)
in their own homes and on supporting medical staﬀin structured environments
such as hospitals. From a technical standpoint, the potential of IoT technology
to enhance or at least to enrich these systems by sensing physiological signals
ubiquitously and unobtrusively, is being increasingly recognized.
However, few studies about IoT-based systems aiming at supporting users
diﬀerent than doctors in hospitals or patients in their homes are available in
the literature. In particular, papers that describe systems to support caregivers
in ALFs1 for persons with disabilities are very limited, with some signiﬁcant
exceptions such as WearNET [1] and AMON [2] which are available in the liter-
ature for almost a decade now. Another exception, more recent and particularly
interesting is presented by Borazio et al. [3], which combines wearable and envi-
ronmental sensing for sleep studies in a non-structured environment.
1 An assisted living facility is a housing facility for persons with disabilities. ALFs
ensure health, safety, and well-being conditions for people in situation of dependency
due to cognitive or physical disabilities. In these facilities, unlike in hospitals, there
are no full-time nurses nor physicians providing medical treatments.

IoT Meets Caregivers: A Healthcare Support System

The objective of this paper is to present the design and preliminary imple-
mentation of an IoT system which combines wearable/mobile technologies with
smart caring environments for supporting caregivers that work in ALFs for per-
sons with disabilities. In particular, such a system fulﬁls six system requirements
derived from the results of three focus groups conducted with 30 caregivers of
diﬀerent ALFs in Northern Italy.

User Requirements Analysis
At our knowledge, there are no speciﬁc design guidelines for healthcare support
systems aimed at supporting caregivers that work with persons with disabili-
ties in ALFs. Therefore, the ﬁrst phase of our study consisted in identifying the
needs and concerns that healthcare workers in ALFs have, understanding how
they tackle problems and diﬃculties in their daily work, and how technology can
help or support them. To that end, we conducted three 90-min group interviews
in the form of focus groups, in three diﬀerent RAFs (Residenza Assistenziale
Flessibile, an Italian type of ALF). These group interviews were held in Ital-
ian and focused on caregivers’ daily activities, common problems and desires.
Full audio recordings and photos of particular areas and systems of the three
ALFs were collected. We interviewed 30 participants, 22 female and 8 male,
with diﬀerent years of expertise. All of them were professional caregivers, work-
ing in three RAFs managed by the Cooperativa Frassati2. Two of the structures
accommodate people with various degree of mental disorders, while the third
one houses people with motor impairments. Each RAF hosts around 10 people
and assistance is guaranteed 24/7. All the visited RAFs have a backyard, a fully
equipped kitchen, a laundry, an inﬁrmary, a living room, a space used as an
oﬃce by caregivers and single or shared bedrooms for the inhabitants. Based
on such data and on relevant related works such as [4] carried out by Morris
et al., we extrapolated the system requirements on which we built the system
presented in this paper. Common needs emerge from participants, with some
minor diﬀerences due to the diverse type of disabilities present in the RAFs.
In fact, people with motor disabilities perform most of their activities inside
the RAF, while many activities carried on by persons with cognitive disabili-
ties are situated outside the house. During the day, two caregivers are always
present in the RAF, performing various activities, such as personal assistance or
housework. RAF inhabitants can request the assistance of a caregiver by calling
her by voice or using buzzers which are in ﬁxed positions around the house.
During the night, only one caregiver is present in the RAF, performing some
houseworks and running ward rounds. Each caregiver brings with her a cordless
phone, multiple keys and, in some cases, her personal smartphone. RAF inhabi-
tants with mental disabilities, unlike those with motor impairments, do not own
any technological tool, such as smartphones, tablets, or computers. Caregivers
and inhabitants’ parents promote this situation, because of the possibility that
such objects might be stolen, broken or forgotten outside the RAF.

Discussion and System Requirements
We propose an unobtrusive and ubiquitous IoT system with wearable/mobile
components, for eﬀectively tackling the most relevant and frequent problems of
caregivers within RAFs, without compromising the privacy or dignity of the RAF
inhabitants. The system focus on one important issue that emerged during the
focus groups: the modalities to provide and require assistance. Nowadays they
have to call caregivers by voice or using a buzzer which is ﬁxed in some locations
inside the RAF. However, there are situations where caregivers cannot hear
the inhabitants calls, or where the buzzer is not reachable. In fact, inhabitants
may be outside the house, away from caregivers (e.g., in the backyard), or they
may have fallen out of the wheelchair unable to use the buzzer. These missed
calls are a problem that currently is not tackled, but that caregivers perceive as
“really important” since they are not able to timely intervene. Another related
problem of the RAFs we visited that we tried to address with our system, is
how to monitor the inhabitants while they are alone in order to timely assist
them, in case of need. Inhabitants with either mental or physical disabilities
may need quick assistance, but may not be able to request it, e.g., they may be
in the middle of an epileptic seizure. Until now, the problem has been tackled
by running overnight ward rounds to constantly check for potentially hazardous
situations, while during the day it has not been tackled at all.
The overall system requirements, elicited from the analysis of the focus groups
results, are reported below. Some of them can be also found, in similar formula-
tions, in other related works such as [4].
1. Detection and notiﬁcation of potentially hazardous situations. Caregivers
should be alerted when an inhabitant is involved in a potentially hazardous
situation, without the need of constantly running ward rounds or using pri-
vacy invasive methods (e.g., video recording).
2. Supporting smart assistance. Provide the inhabitants with a smart way of
requiring the caregivers assistance, without using noisy buzzers. Conﬁrm that
the assistance requests are addressed properly by at least one caregiver.
3. Determining inhabitants presence in sensitive areas. Some places of the RAF
may not be suitable for the inhabitants, so caregivers want to know where
they are located.
4. Support for RAF management aspects. Caregivers require that if some infor-
mation system has to be implemented, it must support some management
aspects of the RAF as well as the inhabitants routines planning.
5. Unobtrusiveness. Caregivers do not want more “objects” to carry around or
strange “gadgets” to use, even if they give useful functionalities. Therefore,
the system must fade in the background of the daily life in an unobtrusive
way.
6. Hands-free operations. Caregivers require to have their hands free, for being
ready to assist inhabitants as soon as possible, without concerning about the
“health” of the device (i.e., they must be resistant to water and shocks).

System Design
For meeting the requirements reported in the previous section, we designed a
system that monitors RAF inhabitants by measuring and interpreting some of
their body signals and environmental conditions to notify the caregivers whether
and where their assistance is needed. In general, the system ﬁrst collects data
from all the diﬀerent sources and process it to obtain an overview of the RAF
situation. Then, by interpreting such information, it determines if an inhabitant
needs assistance. In the case she does, the system is also in charge of notifying
it to the caregivers, for her to be assisted. The caregiver that ﬁrst reaches the
inhabitant, has to turn the notiﬁcation oﬀto prevent his colleagues to come in
vain. The system also is in charge of managing notiﬁcations regarding the overall
RAF management (req. 4).
Sensors. Environmental and wearable sensors are used for measuring the envi-
ronmental conditions of the RAF and the body signals of its inhabitants, respec-
tively. The former sense ambient light, temperature, and people presence in
speciﬁc rooms in order to meet the requirement of determining inhabitants pres-
ence in “sensitive” areas (req. 3), such as the kitchen or the inﬁrmary. Wearable
technology is used because it allows to meet the unobtrusiveness requirement
(req. 5). We choose to adopt the wristwatch form factor since watches are ideally
located for body sensors [5] and wearable displays. The wearable sensors col-
lect acceleration data that can be processed and analysed for detecting epilep-
tic seizures and falls, which is one of the most important system requirements
(req. 1). The wearable devices worn by the inhabitants with adequate cognitive
capabilities, have a “call function” that can be used for consciously requesting
caregivers’ assistance.
Middleware. The middleware is in charge of managing the overall system. It
receives the environmental and body measures from the sensors, interprets them
and determines if a situation that requires the presence of a caregiver is taking
place. The middleware does not aim at assessing exactly what is happening
with each RAF inhabitant, but its scope is to point the caregivers attention to
“suspicious situations” that might require their presence. This means that the
middleware is not designed to try to accurately detect potentially hazardous
situations, such as epileptic seizures, where the consequences of missing one are
very serious and are out of the scope of this kind of support. Caregivers required
this type of notiﬁcation since they are already used to this kind of dynamics in
RAFs, given that ward rounds work like this, i.e., by checking on someone even
if it is not strictly required. Once the middleware determines that the presence
of a caregiver is required somewhere, it sends a proper notiﬁcation to all the
caregivers in the RAF.
Notiﬁcation Devices. The devices in which caregivers receive the notiﬁcations
sent by the middleware could be wearable or mobile. Wearable technology is
the most suitable for meeting most of the previous requirements. One of those

176
S. Aced L´opez et al.
requirements (req. 6) is that caregivers need to have the hands free the most of
the time, therefore a smartphone or a tablet are not appropriate for them. As
in the case of the inhabitant sensors, the notiﬁcation devices use a wristwatch
form factor that is preferred by the caregivers that do not want “another gad-
get to think about”. Mobile devices can be exploited to satisfy requirement 4.
Notiﬁcation devices should have sound and vibration alerts capable to draw the
attention of the caregiver even in noisy environments.
5
Prototype and Preliminary Validation
The designed system was prototyped with reduced functionalities by extend-
ing the Dog gateway3 capabilities to realize the described middleware. We used
sensors of presence, temperature, and light intensity for collecting environmen-
tal data, and the cost-eﬀective and re-programmable Texas Instruments eZ430-
Chronos wristwatch for notifying caregivers and sensing from inhabitants wrists.
This smart watch integrates a 96 segment LCD display, a 3-axis accelerometer,
sensors of temperature, pressure and a battery voltage, into an aﬀordable device.
The only functionality not supported by the eZ430-Chronos is the haptic feed-
back, so at this stage vibration alerts are not implemented yet. We use a custom
ﬁrmware extension4 similar to the one described by De Russis et al. [6]. The
interaction between the wearable devices (eZ430-Chronos) and the middleware
(Dog) adopts a client-server paradigm. Their communication starts automati-
cally once per minute, or manually when an inhabitant requests the caregiver
presence. Each eZ430-Chronos has a unique identiﬁer that is read and stored by
the control system to determine with which device is communicating (i.e., who
asks for assistance).
The feasibility of the proposed system was veriﬁed in the lab and consisted
in the deployment of a scaled down version of the overall system. Two volunteers
acted like a caregiver and a RAF inhabitant equipped with one eZ430-Chronos
wristwatch each. The system encompassed sensors of presence, light and tem-
perature, and the Dog gateway running on a Raspberry Pi5. The goal was to
verify the correct operation of the notiﬁcation subsystem either when the assis-
tance is requested from the inhabitants or when it is requested automatically by
interpreting sensor data. Two use cases were successfully tried out: Assistance
request from the inhabitant and Notiﬁcation of potentially hazardous situation.
In the ﬁrst case the volunteer acting as the inhabitant requested the caregiver
assistance by tapping on her wristwatch. Dog notiﬁed the caregiver providing
the name of the inhabitant asking for his help. In the second case, the volun-
teer acting as the inhabitant moved her arm in such a way that the middleware

could interpret that something may be wrong and alerted the caregiver. In both
cases the system responded in few seconds and the caregiver turned the assis-
tance request oﬀby reaching the inhabitant and tapping a personal code on the
inhabitant’s watch.

Conclusions
In this paper, we present a system that exploits the synergy between wear-
able/mobile technology and environmental sensing to support caregivers work-
ing in assisted living facilities for people with physical or cognitive disabilities.
The system requirements stem directly from three focus groups realized with
30 caregivers in Northern Italy. The system has been prototyped and a prelimi-
nary validation has been performed, for verifying its technical feasibility. Future
work will be expanding the implemented system to eﬀectively detect potentially
hazardous situations by autonomously analysing sensor in real RAFs, and exper-
imenting with other type of wearable/mobile devices.

Introduction
According to WHO, healthy ageing is vital for countries’ economic development
because of it is one of the three pillars of active ageing [1]. Around two billion people
i.e., one out of every four will be older than 60 years in the year 2050 according to [2].
As a consequence there is a need to provide efﬁcient healthcare services to the elderlies.
Here, the term ‘Healthcare’ means diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases and
illnesses of human beings. Traditionally, a healthcare service is mainly focusing on
primary care located at a local community where physician consultations take place for
all patients as the 1st visit [3]. However, today, the healthcare services are not limited to
take place in primary care facilities simply due to deployment of mobile devices and/or
wireless communication. The result is a provision of service that could be accessible to
anyone at any time and in anywhere with a good quality [4]. Research also shows that
several projects like eCAALYX and HELP are on-going which provide home
healthcare for elderly [5]. Similarly, due to the need to have ICT and globalization,
several web sites or online based healthcare service providers are available in the
market which provide possibilities to monitor health parameters such as blood pressure,
blood glucose [9, 10], and activity [16, 17].

This paper presents the deﬁnition and architecture of healthcare service to support a
health monitoring of elderly based on several health parameters through a project called
SAAPHO.1 In SAAPHO, six different health parameters have been considered:
(1) physical activity, (2) blood pressure, (3) glucose, (4) medication compliance,
(5) pulse monitoring and (6) weight monitoring. The project is offering intelligent,
intuitive and user-friendly tools using a mobile tactile interface (android based tablet)
and wireless sensor devices that will allow and facilitate the home monitoring. The
sensor devices for these parameters are wearable and have Bluetooth communication to
send raw data measurements in the cloud (i.e. Health Intelligent Server) for further
processing. Data transfer is done using https and SOAP web services from the sensors
to the cloud and cloud to user-interface. The proposed approach identiﬁed and con-
structed three different kinds of healthcare services for each parameter: (1) real time
feedback generation service, (2) historical summary calculation service and (3) rec-
ommendation generation sDevices_Not_Usedervice. The 1st service applies a rule-
based reasoning technique on each measurement to generate a text based feedback
message. The 2nd service serve a daily/weekly wise historical summary based on raw
measurements and store them into a MySQL database for ofﬂine access by the user.
The 3rd service generates reminder, alarm and necessary recommendation provided on
a weekly basis. A comparison between a case study of user requirements and the
proposed approach is presented where the user requirements are conducted by con-
sidering three perspectives namely (1) end users, (2) clinicians, and (3) ﬁeld study
analysis.

Deﬁnitions and Architecture of the Healthcare Services
The main objective of the healthcare services in SAAPHO is to monitor health
parameters of elderly and warn them in time in order to increase their personal inde-
pendence. Moreover, it also provides recommendations to take necessary steps such as
when they should go to healthcare provider or do any physical exercises. For instance,
considering a scenario of a healthy user, one might have a blood pressure machine or
blood glucose measuring device at home and he/she might use the devices in his/her
daily lives. However, the devices only provide some values i.e. 122/82 or 5.7 mmol/L
[9] and if someone is technically sound they might have the possibility to use internet
and Google and try to interpret the measurement values or need to ask to the health
provider directly. At the same time, as soon as someone diagnosed with heart disease or
diabetes, a clinician might want to see a historical measurement for a week or a month
before they start to use any medication. For example, a diabetes patient often asked by
the healthcare provider to use a log book or diary where they can write all the mea-
surements they have taken [10]. Moreover, depending on patient’s historical mea-
surements a doctor provides his/her recommendation on food, medication or when they
should meet again. Thus, the proposed approach has identiﬁed the healthcare services

with three different kinds of facilities for each parameter, (1) real time feedback gen-
eration service, (2) historical summary calculation service and (3) recommendation
generation service.
The goal of the Real Time Feedback Generation Service is to provide a feedback
message based on sensor readings in real time. Here, a rule-based classiﬁcation method
is applied to classify the measurements. For example, a blood pressure measurement
142/92 mmHg could be classiﬁed as “High blood pressure” and/or BMI 26.1 by
measuring user’s weight2 could be classiﬁed “Overweighed”. A set of rules used in the
classiﬁcation method are mainly collected from the literature study [6–9, 11, 12, 15]
which is further validated through healthcare practitioners. For example, rules for blood
pressure and medication compliance are presented in Table 1. The rule-based classi-
ﬁcation scheme is developed in an Intelligent Health Gateway (see Sect. 2.1 archi-
tecture), where as soon as the gateway receives the measurements it classiﬁes them.
It is crucial to keep and store all measurements especially if someone has diabetes
or high blood pressure since this kind of diseases need a proper management in order to
keep a healthy lifestyle. A weekly or monthly diary book is often used to keep track of
blood glucose measurements and this helps to adjust medicine and food nutrition for a
diabetes patient [9] as an example. A similar concept is proposed here in the Historical
Summary Calculation Service, which means the service will calculate historical sum-
mary on a daily and weekly basis. This historical summary information is calculated
automatically and stored into the Health Intelligent Server (HIS) as presented in
Sect. 2.1 architecture. A user has a possibility to see a summary in a graph for a speciﬁc
range of dates. In order to calculate the summary, the service uses raw data mea-
surements and the classiﬁcation. This service mainly considers frequency of each
classes and the number of total measurements. For example, in order to monitor
medication compliance it calculates “total number of medication is taken”, “total
number of medications”, and “total number of medications are skipped”. The historical

summary calculation service collects the measurements for each individual parameter
for user from MySQL health database and starts historical summary calculation on a
daily and weekly basis. The automatic scripts for calculating daily and weekly based
historical summary are developed using PHP programming language where the script
for daily-wise historical summary runs every day at 23:59 and the script for weekly-
wise historical summary runs on every Saturday at 23:59 (once a week). After cal-
culating the summary, the information is again saved and stored into the MySQL health
database for further use.
The main objective of the Recommendation Generation Service is to generate a
recommendation including reminder and alarm based on user’s historical summary and
raw data measurements.
1. Devices_Not_Used: a reminder message is generated if there is no measurement
received over one week duration i.e. the sensor device is not used for a week.
2. Medications_Skipped: an alarm message is generated if the number of medications
skipped and the number of medication that should be taken in a day is equal, i.e. the
patient totally skipped taking his/her medication for that day.
3. Out_Of_Normal_Range: considering a week, if 70 % of the measurements classes
are outside the normal range, a recommendation message is generated to “Visit a
healthcare provider”.
4. Fluctuation: if the measurements over a week show ﬂuctuation in more than 70 %
of the cases, a recommendation message is generated to “Go to a doctor”.
5. Weight_Loss: the current weight will be compared with the previous weight
(3 months ago) and the recommendation is generate “Visit your doctor” while the
difference is more than 3 kg.
6. Weight_Increased/Weight_Decreased: considering one month measurements, a
slope value will be calculated. Based on positive/negative slope value the weight
increased/decreased recommendation is generated.
7. Activity_Increased/Activity_Decreased: considering one week measurements, a
slope value will be calculated. Based on positive/negative slope value the activity
increased/decreased recommendation is generated.
8. A monthly summary is generated based on the raw measurements where statistical
features i.e. maximum, minimum, standard deviation, and average for each week is
calculated. This information together with the date will be sent to the user via email.
The automatic script for recommendation generation is developed in the Health
Intelligent Server (HIS) using PHP programming language and they run once in a
week, i.e. every Saturday at 23:59. The generated messages are sent to the user
according their priority value calculated based on user’s age, health parameters and the
classiﬁcation. The monthly summary information and recommendation are also gen-
erated automatically once in a month and provide the information to the user’s email.
2.1
Architecture of the Healthcare Services
In order to provide an intelligent healthcare service through SAAPHO, several com-
ponents are considered and integrated. Figure 1 presents all the components related to
Intelligent Healthcare Services
181

the healthcare service and communications between the components. The main com-
ponents are: (1) sensor devices for healthcare (2) android based user-interface and
collector (3) intelligent health gateway (4) health backend including middle-ware and
(5) health intelligent server. The sensor unit contains six health related sensor devices
and the devices are run by battery and communicate via Bluetooth communication. The
sensor devices are paired with a Tablet where android operating system is installed.
Some sensor devices are just bought from the market and integrated into the system, for
example, the blood pressure and weight monitoring devices are collected from a third
party vendor OMRON3 and BeneCheck4 and others are in-house products provided by
the work package partner IZM5 which are under development. The sensor is sending
the data sets via Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) to the collector.
In the Tablet, user-interface and collector are running, where the collector receives
health measurements using Bluetooth communication from the sensor devices upon
user request through the user-interface. The Collector is based on native Java source
code, which is in general the main programming language for Android devices. As
soon as the collector receives the measurements it transfers them to the intelligent
health gateway through https protocol and SOAP web service communication. The
measurements are sent as a zip ﬁle including timestamps, battery and some other
related information. The user interface is developed using JAVA programming lan-
guage so that it can run in Android 4.0 operating system considering the Google Nexus
10 device. The Intelligent Health Gateway mainly conveys the message among the
collector, HIS and middle-ware. It classiﬁes the measurements, calculates priority, asks
for message id to the Health Intelligent Server (HIS) and ﬁnally forwards them to the
middle-ware through health backend. The middle-ware is a module collected from
AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) architecture6 which includes services broker, security
manager, adaptive front-end application and etc. The health backend is the entry point
of the middle-ware, where SessionID and UUID are for each user is generated in

security manager. Adaptive Front-End Application (AFEA), is a module in the user’s
device, which is in charge of handling the interaction of the user with the User Interface
and of presenting the information in the way indicated by the AAL architecture.
Services Broker (SB) hosts a registry of descriptions of the services inside the AAL
architecture but also of services out of it that could be useful for the users [14]. Middle-
ware also stores all the service URLs and user ids and communicates with other
components using health backend. Middle-ware receives the measurements and gen-
erates a textual feedback message based on the measurements and their classiﬁcation.
Finally, the textual message is sent to the user in SAAPHO user-interface. The health
intelligent server (HIS) stores all the raw measurements and generates message id for
the communication. It also calculates daily and weekly historical summary and store
them in a MySQL database. The user has a direct access to the HIS to see the historical
summary through the user-interface. HIS also generates recommendation in weekly
basis based on historical summary and raw data measurements. The generated
recommendations are sent to the user through health gateway, health backend and
middle-ware.

Evaluations
During the SAAPHO’s system design, a questionnaire is used to collect the users’
needs and preferences. Here, the main goal was to collect the users’ requirements to
select the technology, devices, to design the components that the system should have,
and to deﬁne the functionality. Regarding the questionnaires, participants were asked
about general requirements for SAAPHO system. Participants also indicated their
needs and preferences in monitoring their health (medication, activity and blood
pressure). For example: ‘How would you like to monitor your medication compliance –
e.g. buzzer light…-?’; ‘Would you be interested in monitoring your daily physical
activity?’. The user requirements presented here considering three perspectives and
they are (1) end users, (2) clinicians, and (3) ﬁeld study analysis. The user requirements
have been gathered via a ﬁeld study conducted in Spain and Slovenia which included a
questionnaire with 201 participants followed by 2 focus groups [13]. Below the paper
compares the requirements and users viewpoints about the proposed approach i.e. the
healthcare services to provide remote health monitoring of elderlies.
According to end user perspective, the activity monitoring device should monitor
1st the movement of a user in time stamped and classiﬁed them as none, low, medium
or high level. 2nd it can also calculate the calorie consumption based on number of step
counts and present information in a trending graph on calories/step counts. The blood
glucose monitoring could measure blood sugar several times a day and in the case of
diagnosed Diabetes it could provide the real time feedback. The blood sugar value
could be stored with a time stamp which would then be analyzed to detect the status of
diagnosed diabetes. It is important to monitor blood pressure for the elderly, moreover
in the case of people who have already experienced high blood pressure. Forgetfulness
is one of the leading reasons for medication non-compliance, which could be solved
Intelligent Healthcare Services
183

through a reminder system. The medication monitoring tool could track the drug
regime and be able to raise alarms when not being followed properly and/or also
reminding if the medicine was taken. Using the pulse monitoring tool, one could know
whether the intensity of the physical activity was too high, exceeding the threshold
value (especially with more strenuous exercises, like walking uphill, running, cycling).
Regularly weight monitoring is also interesting and could be used once in a week
and some recommendation is necessary when the weight is lost. Moreover and
very important is the ease of use, affordability and ease of carrying the device on a
person’s body. The users would prefer a wearable sensor during training and read
results later at home.
According to clinical perspective, glucose monitoring should be used by the
individuals diagnosed from Type 2 Diabetes to monitor their blood glucose and typ-
ically these types of patients measure their blood glucose at least once a day. Activity
monitoring could promote physical activity and enhance healthy ageing. Considering
the pulse monitoring, it could be useful to detect heart rate during exercise as proxy of
exercise intensity and provide information if the intensity of exercise they do is right or
too demanding for them. In medication monitoring, the treatment plan of medication
should be adjusted on a weekly basis mainly by the patients themselves and a formal or
informal career. Depending on speciﬁed times (i.e. morning, midday, night, before
sleep) a reminder could be generated and presented. Blood pressure is very important to
measure for the older persons who are diagnosed with Hypertension (high blood
pressure), as they typically need frequent monitoring. Similarly, checking weight is
also valuable; it will help to adjust daily meal. Moreover, all the monitoring systems
could facilitate self-management and communication with health professionals. That
means the results could be presented very clearly and could display the trends and
comparison with reference values. In order to facilitate communication with healthcare
professionals, data could be transferred to the healthcare center and be read by clini-
cians, but also the older person could present them personally in his/her smartphone or
tablet PC to the healthcare provider (if no e-health system is available).
According to the ﬁeld study analysis and results, the activity monitoring should
calculate both the step count and calorie burn and be presented in trending graphs
(calorie, weight, step counts). Presenting data graphically could be done using some
summary bar graph where the accumulated (weekly or monthly) duration of non-
walking activities are shown together with bars for the step count and calories for the
same period. Concerning the blood glucose monitoring, the diabetes patients require a
direct feedback on glucose value both when at home and on the go. Regarding the
blood pressure monitoring, users would typically take a reading once a week and add
comments to blood pressure readings like, “gym”, “measured when feeling unwell” etc.
to facilitate interpretation in the context. The user would like to have reminders for their
medication however, the length of the so called “reminder cancel window” has to be
adjustable as it depends on the type of medication. On the sensor side, the reminder
signal should be both buzzer and light, the reminder function should continue as long
as the cap is left off. Considering the pulse monitoring, the sensor should alarm in real-
time during training especially when the pulse is too high.

Conclusions
This paper has provided a description of the deﬁnition of the healthcare services and
their design in the context of the SAAPHO project. Speciﬁc emphasis has been placed
on detailing the different type of services and health parameters that will be used in the
project. The paper has also provided a comparison of these services against the per-
spective of the end-users and the healthcare professionals. The aim of this paper has
been to share the design of the healthcare services so that other similar efforts can
take part in the speciﬁc values and rules that have been used within the context of
the project. Future work will evaluate this ﬁrst version of the services in a controlled
ﬁeld trial.

Abstract. This paper presents the architecture of a medical platform for chronic
diseases sufferers that enables specialist physicians to have a permanent over-
view of the patient’s health. The proposed system, HChecked, integrates the
monitoring of vital parameters, reception of notiﬁcation in case of any exceeding
of the pre-deﬁned limits of these parameters and prediction of the evolution of
the current disease or of the possibility of occurrence of another disease. The
software system follows the idea of trading systems that offers efﬁcient pre-
diction with a high level of security. This concept is based on a particular
implementation of ﬁnite state-machine algorithms, which enable physicians to
run complex rules against particular health information of a certain patient to
predict the evolution of the current diseases or the appearance of others.
Although the system allows many points of view, this paper is oriented towards
the speciﬁc way in which complex rules are created.

Introduction
The potential for pervasive computing is evident in almost every aspect of our lives
including the hospital, emergency and critical situations, industry or education. The use
of this technology in the ﬁeld of health and wellness is known as pervasive health care.
Mobile computing describes a new class of mobile computing devices which are
becoming omnipresent in everyday life [1].
A signiﬁcant proportion of the human population suffers from various medical
conditions, including chronic ailments and medical emergencies due to sudden injuries.
In absence of continuous medical care, many chronic ailments prove to be fatal. On the
other hand, in various medical emergency scenarios, timeliness of medical attention is
even more important [2]. Today, chronic diseases represent the major share of the
burden of disease in Europe and are responsible for 86 % of all deaths. They affect
more than 80 % of people aged over 65 and represent a major challenge for health and
social systems [3].

One of the main challenges in the management of chronic diseases is the efﬁcient
and continuous monitoring of the patient’s health by the health professionals. In that
sense, the patient-doctor interaction is preferred to not happen in a monthly basis
scheme, but it can be continuous by using monitoring systems [4]. Although this
statement may seem obvious, the continuous care they should be provided is often
overlooked. The use of a history of a patient’s evolution may be helpful not only for
that particular individual, but also for those suffering of similar symptoms. The help
they need should not come only in case of an emergency, prevention being an
important factor to take into consideration when speaking about chronic disease suf-
ferers. We propose a system that is able to record and monitor a patient’s health
parameters by creating and distributing notiﬁcations when the received data exceeds
the limits of the complex conditions that are pre-deﬁned by the specialist physicians.
This paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 describes the system from the hardware
and software point of view, also presenting the applications the specialist physician and
patient can use. Section 3 presents the ﬁnite state machine algorithm that is used to
analyze the patient’s data. Section 4 gives an example of how this algorithm can be
used to create complex rules for a patient.

System Overview
Recent advances in biomedical engineering, wireless network and computer technol-
ogies have enabled the possibility of remote patient monitoring. Based on these
technologies, it is possible to improve patient care, chronic disease management, and
promote lifelong health and wellbeing [5].
Data mining in the medical context can be seen very challenging from the spe-
cialist’s physician point of view which does not possess technical skills to write and
execute complex algorithms to analyze patient health data. Moreover, adding real-time
analyzing and large data sets of medical information to the equation makes the problem
seem unsolvable for the end-user.
We propose as a solution a medical platform capable to abstract the problem of
real-time big data analyzing, including an interface that offers the possibility to create
complex equations on patient data deﬁned as ﬁnite state-machine algorithms.
In this section we look at the complex e-health platform, taking into consideration
the way the data ﬂow is structured. This project represented Romania in the Worldwide
Final of the Imagine Cup competition 2013. This is the reason why the main software
technologies used in the current system are Microsoft based.
To enable the continuous care a chronic disease patient needs, the platform offers
the doctors various applications that work on different devices. The smartphone/tablet
application for physician helps the doctors to be up to date with the health state of the
patient and can receive notiﬁcations. The desktop application for physician produces
the environment where the doctors can create complex rules. The smartphone appli-
cation for patient collects medical data from the sensors and sends them forward to be
analyzed (Fig. 1).
The data acquisition system that we used as a development kit contained different
types of sensors (electrocardiogram, glucometer, pulse and oxygen in blood, galvanic
188

skin response, blood pressure, body temperature, patient position, airﬂow) depending
on the diseases that we wished to be monitored (see Fig. 2).
From the software point of view, this system offers accurate predictions, but also a
high level of security. After creating complex rules that will be described in the next
section, the specialist physician will receive notiﬁcations at certain moments.
These notiﬁcations can be classiﬁed into two categories: General Notiﬁcations and
Emergency Notiﬁcations. When a doctor receives a General Notiﬁcation it means that
the limits that he has enforced have been overcome. In such cases, the treatment should
be checked or further investigations should be considered. If an Emergency Notiﬁca-
tion has been sent, physicians enrolled in the community who are in the vicinity and the
ambulance are announced. For the physicians to be correctly localized, the system uses
the GPS, feature that is used also for localizing the patient in need. Using these two
Fig. 1. Overview of the system

points, the system is able to generate a map, which the doctor follows to get to the
patient. When the physician reaches the patient, he is provided with a small health
proﬁle that gives him the necessary clues to know in which way he should act.
If the system were to collect all the data received from the sensors, storing them
would represent a problem. However, because the limits in which we should ﬁnd the
health information are pre-deﬁned, the system stores the data in the cloud only after it
has been ﬁltered.
Although the system comes in use for every individual patient in the community,
the collected information, after approval and anonymization, can be also used in
research projects and statistics. In this way, medical and pharmaceutical institutions can
use these results for further research.

Analyzing Patient Data Using Finite State Machine
Algorithms
We modeled the complex-rules part of the system using ﬁnite state machine algorithms
because they can be easily comprehended by any specialist physician without any
technical background or programming knowledge (Fig. 3).
We introduce the concept of operator, which is a component of a state of the ﬁnite
state-machine algorithm. Each of them can be seen as a template of simple, pre-deﬁned
equations that can be combined in any way to create a complex rule to be veriﬁed
against patient data. In the ﬁrst version of the system we introduce four categories of
operators:
Data operators (= , < , > , ≤, ≥). These are the simplest operators that can be used
directly with the patient data. For example, the doctor can set the heart rate to be greater
than 80.
Time operators (time interval, minimum period, maximum period).These operators
can be used only if they are correlated with data operators. Basically, continuing the
same example as above, we are able to deﬁne the heart rate to be greater than 80 for
seven days (or for minimum seven days or for maximum seven days).
Fig. 3. Desktop application - screenshot.
190

Number of occurrences (minimum, maximum, equal). These operators can be used
with any other type, having different behavior based on the correlation that has been
made. If we refer to the data operators, we verify that a patient health data respects the
rule for a number of times; if we combine them with time operators we check if the
occurrences happen in a certain period of time; ﬁnally if we combine them with
notiﬁcation operators, that will be described, there will be a number of notiﬁcations
equal to the number of occurrences. It will also be included in the meta-data of the
online version.

Use Case Example
For a better understanding of how the proposed platform can be used and how simple it
is for patients to be monitored we will take a particular case of a patient suffering of
both diabetes and heart disease. Diabetes by itself is now regarded as the strongest risk
factor for heart disease [6]. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major complication of
diabetes and the leading cause of early death among people with diabetes – about 65 %
of people with diabetes die from heart disease and stroke. Intensive glucose control
reduces the risk of any CVD event by 42 % and the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death
from CVD by 57 % [7].
Based on the data acquisition system that we currently use we will take into
consideration that the patient is wearing sensors for blood glucose, heart rate and blood
pressure. An example of a complex rule created by specialist physicians is presented in
Fig. 4.
Fig. 4. Example of complex rule.
Real-Time Monitoring Using Finite State-Machine Algorithms
191

This complex rule is aimed to keep under control the blood glucose and the
parameters regarding the heart disease and has two stages: ﬁrst stage veriﬁes the blood
glucose of the patient for one week and the second stage checks if the heart rate and
blood pressure exceed the limits pre-deﬁned by the physician.
As seen in Fig. 4, if the patient’s blood glucose is greater than 100 for one week, the
diabetologist will receive a notiﬁcation and then and only then the system will analyze
the history data for the heart rate and blood pressure. If these parameters overcome the
limits set by the cardiologist, he will be announced.
5
Conclusions
In this paper we have described an e-health platform created especially for chronic
disease patients, focusing upon the way ﬁnite state machine algorithms are used to
enable the physicians to create complex rules in an easy-to-use environment. While
designing our system, our team consistently took into consideration the advice of
medical professionals in order to identify their points of interest. The speciﬁc element
of the system is the possibility to create individualized operators using basic operators,
which were also previously described. This paper includes also a use case example to
offer an idea about how the ﬁnite state machine algorithm is used for designing rules.

Abstract. In order to prevent the lack of appropriate respiratory ventilation
which causes brain damage and critical problems, it is required to continuously
monitor the breathing signal of a patient. There are different conventional
methods for capturing respiration signal, such as polysomnography and spi-
rometer. In spite of their accuracy, these methods are expensive and could not be
integrated in a body sensor network. In this work, we present a real-time cloud-
based respiration monitoring platform which allows the patient to continue
treatment and diagnosis from different places such as home. These remote
services are designed for patients who suffer from breathing problems or sleep
disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) and cloud database. Based on the high correlation between spi-
rometer and accelerometer signals, the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
has been applied on respiration signals. The obtained results show that DFA can
be used as an efﬁcient feature while classifying the healthy people from patients
suffering from breath abnormalities.

Introduction
Recently, there are different studies and reports which show the importance of moni-
toring and analyzing the respiration signals in many ﬁelds such as medicine and
physiology [1–4]. Today about 7 % of the population of developed countries suffer
from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and it is a growing problem in
developing countries. For example, an estimated of 3.7 million people live with COPD
in UK, predicted to increase by one-third by 2030, costing the NHS £1.2 billion/yr [3].
Moreover, professionals in breathing and sleep centers are demanded to assist people
with shortness of breath, cardiovascular problems, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis,
stroke, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden infant death syndrome (SISD).
Therefore, a real-time monitoring of the respiration rhythm plays an important role in

(DKA), brain disorders as well as abnormal breathing of newborns at home. There are
different conventional methods for respiration waveform measurement, such as spi-
rometry, nasal thermocouples, impedance plethysmography, inductance pneumography
strain gauge measurements of thoracic circumference, whole-body plethysmography
[4], pneumatic respiration transducers, the ﬁber-optic sensor method [4, 5], the Doppler
radar [5, 6], and electrocardiogram (ECG)-based derived respiration measurements
[7–9]. However, in spite of their accuracies, these methods are expensive and inﬂexible
which may bring discomfort to the patients and physicians. One recent area of interest is
applying motion sensors to detect the small movements of the chest wall that occur
during expansion and contraction of the lungs. In preliminary trials on hospital patients,
it has been shown that [10] with proper signal processing, this method can produce
results that closely match with measurements of nasal cannula pressure [10]. A vali-
dation of respiratory signal derived from suprasternal, notch acceleration has been
investigated by [11] for different body positions. Their data storage and processing is
performed on a computer with their custom build LabVIEW Virtual Instrument. The
main objective of this study is to provide a new cloud-based tool for monitoring and
analyzing the respiration patterns with accelerometer sensor. The previous approaches
are primarily based on the use of ofﬂine data loggers and on-board signal processing.
However, in our system we use cloud database which can offer signiﬁcant advantages
over traditional methods, including increased on-line accessibility, scalability, automatic
failover and fast automated recovery from failures. The accelerometer data is transmitted
via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to PC/iPhone and then it is sent to the cloud to be
processed and saved, immediately. Therefore, the physicians can track the patients
wherever they are with devices such as an iPhone, iPad or the web regardless of their
proximity to the patients. Moreover the ﬂuctuation analysis of the signals for each
patient is investigated as an effective feature to distinguish breath problems.
In Sect. 2, the signal processing procedures applied on accelerometer signal are
explained. In Sect. 3, the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) has been applied on
respiration signals derived from the accelerometer to help distinguishing between
normal and abnormal respiration patterns. Experimental results are presented and
discussed in Sect. 4. Finally Sect. 5 concludes the paper.

Data Preprocessing
We mounted the sensor on the chest where is more comfortable compared to supra-
sternal notch position used in [11]. In order to make sure that the sensors’ readings are
accurate enough to be processed, we calibrate our accelerometer sensor using linear
least square method proposed by [12]. Due to inherent deﬁciency or aging problems in
cyber-biological systems, sensors calibration is suggested. Calibration, which is deﬁned
as the process of mapping raw sensor readings into corrected values, can be used to
compensate the systematic offset and gain [13]. Generally, calibration of sensors
requires experience and special accurate tools; however, a straightforward method to
calibrate an accelerometer is performed at 6 stationary positions. We need to collect a
few seconds of accelerometer raw data at each position. Then the least square method
is applied to obtain the 12 accelerometer calibration parameters. The calibration

procedure is simple, and needs to be executed once. The calibration procedure can be

Based on the ﬁxed sensor position, the data processing and analysis are performed on
z-axis of the accelerometer. The accelerometer data is ﬁltered through a 10th order
Butterworth low pass ﬁlter with cutoff frequency 1 Hz. In the next part we are going to
analyze the ﬂuctuation of different breathing patterns resulted from ﬁve types of res-
piration disorders.

Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) quantiﬁes fractal like auto-correlation proper-
ties of the signals [14]. It is generally accepted that the signiﬁcant complexity of
biological signals is due to two main factors [15] i.e. high complexity of systems and
their susceptibility to environmental factors [14]. Biological signals are difﬁcult to
analyze because they are mostly non-stationary and from a wide range of physiological
phenomena possess a scale invariant structure [16, 17]. Indeed, they have a scale
invariant structure when the structure repeats itself on subintervals of the signal [17].
The validation of accelerometer driven respiration signal is investigated in [18] and
the mean correlation of 0.84 which shows a very close correspondence of the accel-
erometer sensor and spirometer data is obtained. Therefore, here we make use of this
result and DFA effectiveness is analyzed to discriminate healthy from pathological
accelerometer driven respiration patterns.
DFA was ﬁrst introduced by Peng et al. [19]; and Acharya et al. [20] uses DFA for
disease classiﬁcation in ECG studies. In many cases the DFA scaling exponent can be
used to distinguish healthy and unhealthy data [21]. Indeed, DFA is a scaling analysis
method that provides a simple quantitative parameter to represent the autocorrelation
properties of a signal [19]. Thus, it could be a good feature to be utilized in the
classiﬁcation techniques. Figure 1, brieﬂy summarized the proposed procedures.

3.1
DFA Algorithm
In the application of DFA to our extracted respiration signal, parameter B is the peak to
peak (P_P) interval of breathing signal. We applied a peak detector algorithm which
deﬁned a customized threshold to decide whether each peak is signiﬁcantly larger than
the local data and then the peak intervals are calculated. B is ﬁrst integrated in Eq. (1) to
calculate the sum of the differences between the ith P_P interval BðiÞ and the mean P_P
interval Bave.

Next, as is shown in Fig. 2 for respiration signal, the integrated series y k

divided into boxes of equal length n. Each box is subsequently detrended by sub-
tracting a least square linear ﬁt, denoted as ynðkÞ.Then the Root Mean Square (RMS) of
this integrated and detrended time series is obtained by:

In the example in Fig. 2, n is equal to 3. The linear dependence indicates the
presence of self-ﬂuctuations and the slope of the line determines the scaling exponent α
[17, 22]:
FðnÞ  na
The parameter α (scaling exponent, autocorrelation exponent, self-similarity
parameter) shows the autocorrelation properties of the signal [20, 23]:
1. α < 0.5 anti-correlated signal
2. α = 0.5 uncorrelated signal (white noise)
3. α > 0.5 positive autocorrelation in the signal

4. α = 1 Pink noise or 1/f noise
5. α = 1.5 Brownian noise or random walk.
Gifani et al. [14] claims that using scaling exponent α, one can completely describe the
signiﬁcant autocorrelation properties of the bio-medical signals. In this study, we use
scaling exponent α of normal breathing as well as ﬁve different diseases.

Experimental Results
In our experiments, the acceleration signal was acquired with MEMS, KXTJ9, 3-axis
low-power accelerometer with 12-bit resolution and sampling rate 50 HZ (Fig. 3(a)).
The data is transmitted via CC2541 BLE, a new standard that allows Bluetooth
equipment to run for long time on a single coin cell battery. It is worth noting that our
node is fully radio type approved for US, Europe, Japan and Canada. The received
sensors data are stored in the cloud in order to real-time or further analysis.
4.1
Test Setup
The participants of this study were ﬁve males and six females aged 4 to 48 with
Mean ± SD, 26.54 ± 11.9026. They were instructed how to perform each breath
exercise before their recording sessions. The experimental trials lasted for about 50 min
per subject. We asked the subjects to perform Normal (N1), Bradapnea, Tachypnea,
and Cheyn-stokes patterns, each for 2 min (6000 samples) and the other two types for
1 min with a 3 min rest interval. For simulating apnea in Cheyn-stokes and Biot’s
breathing exercises, we requested the participants to pause breathing for at least 3 s.
Besides, for DFA analysis we asked our subjects to repeat normal breathing for another
1 min (N2). The sensor was mounted on the subject’s chest in the middle of sternum
region (Fig. 3(b)) and secured by a soft and elastic strap which is easy to attach and

comfortable to wear. In the trial session, the subjects were in the lying position;
however, the rest positions or activities in which rib cage is stationary could be
considered.
4.2
Breathing Patterns
In our test, the subjects are asked to perform six breathing patterns i.e., Normal,
Bradapnea, Tachypnea, Cheyn-stokes, Kaussmal, and Biot’s. Bradapnea is regular in
rhythm but slower than normal in rate. Tachypnea is the condition of rapid breathing,
with respiration rate higher than 20 respirations per minute (rpm). Tachypnea may
occur due to physiological or pathological problems [24]. Cheyn-stokes breathing
pattern is determined by gradually increasing, then decreasing the lung volume with a
period of apnea. People suffering from central sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS) have the
same breathing pattern at sleep [25]. Kussmaul which is deﬁned as a rapid, deep and
labored breathing type usually occurs in diabetics in diabetic ketoacidosis [26]. Biot’s
breathing is characterized by periods of rapid respirations followed by regular periods
of apnea. There are different reasons which causes Biot’s breathing, such as damage to
the medulla oblongata by stroke (CVA) or trauma, or pressure on the medulla due to
uncal or tentorial herniation and prolonged opioid abuse [26]. Figure 4 shows samples
of all normalized patterns extracted from accelerometer sensor.
4.3
DFA Analysis
In this section the respiration data are successfully analyzed using the DFA algorithm.
Short-term data of 1-min duration for periods of normal and abnormal breathings and
ﬁve scales 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are considered. The average ﬂuctuations versus box-size are
plotted in Fig. 5.

The graphs in Fig. 5 are for one of our subjects. It was observed that, each subject
has its own signal characteristics based on the ﬂuctuation analysis. It is worth noting
that for all subjects, there is a difference in the average scaling exponent α of normal
and abnormal respirations which helps us to use DFA as one of the effective features
for healthy and unhealthy classiﬁcation. This difference is various for different types of
disorders and in some cases we can see the higher diverse which results in more reliable
distinction. As a sample in Fig. 5, the blue and red lines are two normal patterns which
obviously resulted in parallel lines (equal slope) while the black lines depict the speciﬁc
disorders with different slopes. Table 1 shows the obtained scaling exponent for the
whole population and patterns. Considering object 1, her normal respiration signal
based on α is an anti-correlated signal shown in Fig. 5(a).
According to the obtained results in Fig. 5, the Kaussmal and Biot’s respiration
signals are close to white noise while for Bradapnea and Cheyn-stokes breathing
models, the signals are included in positive autocorrelation category. Her Tachypnea
breathing is close to Pink noise in which the power spectral density is inversely
proportional to the frequency of the signal. The absolute differences of scaling expo-
nents of N2 and abnormal patterns with respect to N1 are presented in Fig. 6(a).
It can be also seen in Fig. 6(b) that for all subjects, the greater mean differences are
belong to the abnormal patterns while the differences of the second normal breathing
are very close to zero. If we consider all subjects and breath patterns, α differences of
abnormal breathings and N2 with regard to N1 are 0.51 ± 0.19 and 0.05 ± 0.04,
respectively. Therefore, we conclude that DFA on respiration signals is a good and
simple criterion to be used as an important feature in breath disorders detection.

Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a respiration monitoring system as well as applying the
detrended ﬂuctuation analysis on the accelerometer driven respiration signal. The
results revealed the potential of remote diagnosis based on accelerometer sensor as a
simple, convenience and low-cost method. In this platform, the physicians are able to
share information together and precisely diagnosis the breathing diseases as well as
monitoring the patient’s progressing in performing the prescribed breathing exercises in
respiratory therapy wherever they are with devices such as an iPhone, iPad or the web
regardless of their proximity to the patients.
Therefore, early identiﬁcation through this portable monitoring system and timely
treatment of exacerbations can decrease the hospital admissions and slow deterioration
while reducing early mortality and disease costs [27].

Abstract. In recent days, physiological sensing using smartphones is
gaining attention everywhere for preventive health-care. In this paper,
we propose a 2-stage approach for robust heart rate (HR) calculation
from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal, captured using smartphones.
Firstly, Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) based adaptive ﬁlter is
used to clean up the noisy PPG signal. Then, heart rate is calculated
from the frequency spectrum, which is further ﬁne-tuned using diﬀerent
interpolation techniques. Experimental results, show that the overall HR
calculation improves signiﬁcantly due to the proposed 2-stage approach.

Introduction
Personal healthcare and wellness have emerged as a powerful market segment
and has empowered active research in that domain. Several approaches have been
used to measure physiological parameters and record them for further study by
healthcare professionals and care-givers. Early devices came with connectivity to
personal computers which allowed data logging and display. This was replaced
with Bluetooth and Zigbee enabled devices that can transmit wireless data to
gateway devices or the user’s mobile phone for local logging or remote logging
via server connectivity.
Although the above model brought in ease of use for both the user as well as
the care-givers and physicians, the cost of ownership and maintenance of such
devices lies largely with the users, preventing their mass penetration especially
in developing countries.
The above problems created the need for alternative approaches. One such
approach is to use smartphone sensors for monitoring physiological parameters
[3]. Though such readings may not be used for diagnostic purposes, they can
provide indicative value to the user. Since in developing countries, the patient to
doctor ratio is highly skewed, and the cost of owning multiple devices is relatively
high, such approaches are more viable.

The sensors available on a smartphone platform that can be used for physio-
logical sensing includes accelerometer, microphone and camera where the camera
can be used for capturing photoplethysmography (PPG) signal unobtrusively.
PPG is deﬁned as the volumetric measurement of blood ﬂow in body organs
[1]. In principle the volume of blood ﬂowing at a capillary is a function of the
rate at which the heart pumps blood to the body. Hence, the PPG signal over
time reﬂects the heart-rate value of a person. Equipped with camera and ﬂash,
smartphones are able to capture ﬁngertip PPG signal [7]. Although this is true
in theory, the mobile camera based PPG suﬀers from several practical issues.
Firstly, most mobile phones have a camera that can capture video at a maxi-
mum rate of 30 frames per second (fps), yielding a very low sampling-rate data,
compared to medical grade PPG (100 Hz1). Secondly, since the mobile PPG
technology works on reﬂected light rather than transmitted light, oftentimes the
signal quality is poor [6]. Thirdly, user movement and pressure variance causes
artifacts, which adds to the noise, resulting into inaccurate heart-rate detec-
tion. Finally, turning on the LED ﬂash continuously for longer period increases
the temperature of the region surrounding the camera, causing thermal noise in
captured video. In this paper, we demonstrate the behavior of Normalized Least
Mean Square (NLMS) ﬁlter and it’s eﬀects of noise cleaning on noisy phone
PPG signals. In addition, we have also explored diﬀerent interpolation tech-
niques to ﬁne-tune peak detection in frequency domain analysis for improved HR
calculation.

Extraction of Smartphone PPG
There are many techniques available in the literature to extract PPG signal in
reﬂective mode using smartphones. Most of them include capturing of a video
stream by placing the ﬁngertip of the user on the smartphone camera with ﬂash
on. PPG signal is extracted as a time series data, by analyzing the change in
intensity of ‘RED’ component in each frame of the captured video. Three such
methods have been used in the current context for comparative studies.
2.1
Method 1 (P P Gavg)
This method, proposed by Pal et al. [7] selects a region of m×m pixels from the
center of each frame of captured video. The value of PPG signal for lth frame is
represented by the mean value of all the ’Red’ pixels in that selected region.
2.2
Method 2 (P P Garea)
Kurylyak et al. calculates a person speciﬁc threshold (T) for each video by
analyzing the ﬁrst few frames as in [6]. The value of PPG signal for lth frame is
calculated by
PPGarea[l] = number of Red pixels > T
total number of Red pixels

Method 3 (P P Grad)
Extending Method 2, Kurylyak et al. [6] proposed a newer methodology to

Filtering and Interpolation for Cleaner PPG Signal
As mentioned earlier, smartphone PPG signals get corrupted by several noise
sources. In this section, we propose a 2-stage approach to clean up the noise
for better HR estimation. Firstly, we investigate the usage of adaptive ﬁlter to
enhance the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in time domain, followed by diﬀerent
interpolation techniques to further ﬁne-tune HR estimation in frequency domain.
3.1
Normalized LMS Based Filtering
LMS (Least Mean Square) ﬁlters encompass a class of adaptive ﬁlters, which
tries to match a desired ﬁlter, by calculating the ﬁlter coeﬃcients which leads
to least mean squares of the error signal.
Fig. 1. Normalized Least Mean Square Filter
However, LMS ﬁlter has one inherent diﬃculty in estimating the step size μ.
To mitigate this issue, Hayes et al. [4] presented the concept of normalized LMS
(NLMS) where β, a normalized step size, typically within the range {0,2} is
introduced. As shown in Fig. 1, x(n) is the noisy raw PPG signal, i.e. the desired
signal d(n) corrupted by noise v1(n). A delay z−n0 is introduced to the input
signal to obtain a reference signal, which is applied to the adaptive ﬁlter to get
the estimated signal ˆd(n) close to d(n).
3.2
Interpolation
Heart rate is calculated by searching the dominant peak in the frequency spec-
trum of the signal. For frequency domain peak estimation, it’s often common to
have a coarse estimation of the dominant peak, followed by ﬁne search around

206
A.D. Choudhury et al.
that to get the accurate peak location using interpolation. In this paper, we have
explored two interpolation techniques.
1. Linear Interpolation: A simple linear interpolation was employed to ﬁne tune
the frequency domain resolution of PPG signal. This can serve as an ultra-
light reconstruction technique, while porting HeartSense to smartphones.
2. Jacobsen Interpolation: Jacobsen et al. presented the following interpolation
technique for ﬁne resolution frequency estimation in DFT domain [5].
ˆδ = Real[
(Rk−1 −Rk+1)
(2 ∗Rk −Rk−1 −Rk+1)]
(2)
Later Candan [2] proposed a ﬁner version of Jacobsen Intepolation technique
as follows.
ˆδ = tan(π/N)
π/N
∗Real[
(Rk−1 −Rk+1)
(2 ∗Rk −Rk−1 −Rk+1)]
(3)
However, in our approach, we chose N=5122, which makes
tan(π/N)
π/N
→1.
Hence we have limited our experimentation to Jacobsen interpolation.

Experimental Setup
A total of 11 subjects having male to female ratio of 7:4, with an age distribution
of 22-40 years volunteered in our experimentation. During data capture, the
subjects were asked to be in rest position, seating on a chair in an air-conditioned
room for half a minute at the beginning. Later they were asked to make some
light but predeﬁned body movements while seating to add artifacts in their
PPG signal for another half a minute, making the data collection duration of
one minute per subject. Ground truth heart rate for all the subjects was recorded
using a CMS 50D+ digital pulse-oximeter3 from their right hand middle ﬁnger.
Smartphone video for every individual was also collected simultaneously from
the index ﬁnger of the same hand, while keeping the LED ﬂash on. Videos were
collected using the native camera app of iPhone4, iOS 6. All the videos are
recorded in the highest resolution i.e. 1280 × 720 at 30 fps. A total of 11 videos
were collected from 11 subjects. All the 3 algorithms (PPGavg, PPGarea and
PPGrad) were applied to extract 3 sets of PPG signals per video ﬁle.

Results
Our experimental results are broadly classiﬁed into two major sections, 1) Eﬀects
of NLMS ﬁltering on raw phone captured PPG data and 2) Eﬀects of interpola-
tion techniques in estimating HR on NLMS ﬁltered data.

5.1
Eﬀects of NLMS Filtering on Raw Phone Captured PPG Data
The delay parameter plays an important role in the NLMS ﬁlter. As the delay
increases, the correlation of the noise in actual signal with the noise in the
delayed signal drops, resulting in increasing SNR. As shown in Fig. 2, SNR of
the ﬁltered PPG signal is improving along with an increase in delay till a delay
of 12 data points.
Fig. 2. SNR for Diﬀerent Delay Parameters for 11 Subjects and 3 PPG Extraction
Algorithms(the darker and lighter line represents unﬁltered and ﬁltered PPG respec-
tively)
However, as the delay becomes comparable to the time period of signal, the
signal also tends to become uncorrelated. Hence the SNR starts to deteriorate.
In our case, the drop in SNR is visible for a delay of 15 data points. So we ﬁxed a
delay of 12 data points for the rest of our experimentation. Given our data rate
of 30 Hz, a delay of 12 data points would correspond to 40 %-80 % cycle period,
for a heart range of 60-120 respectively.
The eﬀect of NLMS ﬁltering on a typical noisy PPG signal is shown in
Fig. 3(a). It is evident that the peaks and troughs in the ﬁltered signal is far
more prominent in the ﬁltered signal. So for the rest of the experiment, we
incorporate NLMS ﬁltering on the raw PPG signal ﬁrst and then investigate the
eﬀect of diﬀerent interpolation techniques.
5.2
Eﬀects of Interpolation Techniques in Calculating Heart Rate
Interpolation techniques are used to ﬁne tune the dominant peak location in the
frequency response. We have explored 2 diﬀerent interpolation techniques (linear
and Jacobsen interpolation) against 3 PPG extraction methods. As shown in
Fig. 3(b), HR estimation improves when interpolation is applied. However, it
can also be observed that the performance of Jacobsen interpolation technique
outperforms others.

Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we have demonstrated a two-stage approach, i.e. noise cleaning
in time domain and peak frequency estimation in frequency domain by apply-
ing NLMS ﬁltering and diﬀerent interpolation techniques respectively. Jacobsen
interpolation technique has outperformed ‘No Interpolation’ and ‘Linear Inter-
polation’ techniques. Hence, according to our experimentation, irrespective of
various smartphone PPG extraction procedures, NLMS ﬁltering followed by
Jacobsen interpolation is the most optimum method to ﬁnd HR from smart-
phone PPG. Our future work includes analyzing the eﬀects of NLMS ﬁltering
on PPG signal captured using other smartphone models. We also aim to explore
extraction of other physiological parameters, e.g. respiratory rate, blood oxygen
content (SpO2) and blood pressure from the clean PPG signal obtained using
the proposed methodology.

Abstract. Protection of data privacy and anonymity in the healthcare domain is
of crucial importance and imposes many challenges since it regards a multi-fold
and multidimensional process that needs to be safeguarded on multiple levels.
Data protection has to be safeguarded at application and context layer, at session
layer and at network layer. Taking into account the existing challenges, the scope
of the current paper is to present the approach and conceptual architecture of
SHIELD, an innovative methodological approach and network architecture-
deployed within the framework of the FI-STAR project- targeting at the protec-
tion of healthcare information through the pseudo-anonymization of end-users.
SHIELD aspires to provide value added services that could complement the
service offering of the FI-STAR project in particular for the target sector of health
care, and strengthen its technology basis.

Introduction
The European Union is very sensitive with regards to the protection and integrity of
personal healthcare information since processing of and access to healthcare data
imposes severe legal and ethical issues, and has thus issued a plethora of guidelines and
recommendations that need to be met in order to safeguard that the personal infor-
mation of European patients is not forged, tampered with, or retrieved by unauthorised
users in any way, as well as that the processing of information stored in clinical sites
and healthcare facilities does not allow back tracking to patients, at least not without
their informed consent [1, 2].
Privacy protection however is a multi-fold and multidimensional process that needs
to be safeguarded on multiple levels. To comply with the aforementioned regulatory
requirements, everything - the hardware, the software, the network, even the data
itself - must be secured [3, 4]. As such, data protection in the healthcare domain needs
to be safeguarded at (1) application and context layer, deterring phishing and imper-
sonation attempts that may allow access to a (healthcare) information system where

personal information is stored, which an unauthorised user may retrieve and/or alter,
allowing access to such a system and to the information it encloses only to authorised
and veriﬁed users, (2) at session layer, deterring data ﬂow manipulation, malicious
attacks, interception and tampering attempts, that may allow the eavesdropping and/or
tampering with the exchanged information during an open session between two non-
authenticated parties, and allow end-users of a (healthcare) information system (e.g. a
patient) to securely exchange information with this system over the internet throughout
the period during which a session is active between the involved parties [5], and (3) at
network layer, deterring real-time snifﬁng of network packets and network level
traceability, protecting the end-users by preventing third-parties from monitoring the
end-users’ Internet connection, and retrieving the end-users’ physical location which
may in turn be used for malicious acts.
The scope of the current paper is to present the approach and conceptual archi-
tecture of SHIELD, an innovative methodological approach and network architecture
for the protection of healthcare information through the pseudo-anonymization of end-
users. The SHIELD platform approach was submitted at the Future Internet Social
Technological Alignment in Healthcare (FI-STAR) Open Call for additional Project
Partners and included in the FI-STAR project consortium. Towards this end, SHIELD
aspires to provide value added services that could complement the service offering of
the FI-STAR project in particular for the target sector of health care, and strengthen its
technology basis.

Methodology
SHIELD will deliver a methodology, network architecture and software infrastructure
by which the end-user adopts a new artiﬁcial identity, called pseudonym, pseudo-
identity or pseudo-proﬁle, provided by the proposed trusted and secure mechanism,
inheriting and including all features and credentials needed by the existing Identity
Management Generic Enabler of FI-WARE [6].
The proposed SHIELD Platform consists of three (3) sets of software components,
facilitating end-users to preserve their anonymity while interacting with the FI-STAR
healthcare applications and services, without restricting their privileges and beneﬁts
raised from their actual proﬁle:
(1) The Pseudo-anonymization Networking Infrastructure, which guarantees the
anonymity of end-users and the protection of the personal data, at network and
session level, incorporating two main software artifacts: (a) the Pseudonimity
Network Client that operates on-top of a standard TOR-client and is responsible
for anonymizing the communication at IP-level, and (b) the Opportunistic &
Ephemeral Negotiator that establishes a mutual agreement between the negoti-
ating parties, i.e. the end-user pseudonymity client and the SHIELD server, with
regard to the utilization of a symmetric key for encrypting the communication
among them;
(2) The Pseudo-anonymization Application Layer, which guarantees the anonymity
of end-users in the course of their interaction with given applications provided
An Innovative Approach for the Protection of Healthcare Information

though the FI-WARE platform, including two main software components: (a) the
Pseudonymizer that facilitates the generation of discrete pseudonyms and pseudo-
proﬁles for each end user (Pseudonym Generator), ensures that no reference to
these pseudo-proﬁles exists from any proﬁle publicly available on social networks
(Social Clearance), issues a digital certiﬁcate for each pseudo-proﬁle (Digital
Certiﬁcates Creator) that will be used for the user’s interaction with the provided
applications and services, and stores the associations among real users and
pseudonyms in an Encrypted Database; and (b) the Virtual Proxy that acts as an
intermediary for requests from end-users seeking resources from the deployed
technical implementations of the FI-WARE Identity Management General
Enabler (Fig. 1).
(3) The Context Aware Services, which allows the preservation of the context
coherence as well as the secure logging and monitoring of all access to personal
data, including (a) an Activities Monitoring service that gathers all data related
with the activities of a pseudonym, (b) a Secure Logging and Audit Trail Service,
and (c) an Authorized Pseudonym Resolution Service that allows authorized third-
parties to resolve the association between the pseudonym and the real identity of
the end-user.

2.1
SHIELD Pseudo-Anonymization Networking Infrastructure
The SHIELD Pseudo-anonymization Networking Infrastructure will be based on the
establishment and operation of a TOR network combined with the development of the
SHIELD pseudonymity network client [7]. The pseudo-anonymization process begins
with the installation and initiation of a Pseudonimity Network Client at the typical Web
browser of the end-user. The Pseudonimity Network Client constitutes a JAVA-based
client component that is able to be installed and executed on all major operating
systems and encapsulates all the pseudonym acquisition business logic. This acquisi-
tion business logic is realized through a concrete interaction with the SHIELD Server.
The network client will be used by the end-users of the provided services in order to
join the TOR network and handle all the networking communication activities of the
client, ensuring its anonymity in the IP network.
By joining the SHIELD TOR network, connections among network nodes will be
based on the dynamic creation of virtual tunnels. Network ﬂows within the virtual
tunnels will follow random pathways through several relays. The path from the source
to the destination node will be created on the ﬂy and each relay node will be aware of
only the predecessor relay. Network ﬂows data will be encrypted multiple times while
each relay node will be able to decrypt the “layer” of encryption that permits him to be
aware of the successor relay. The negotiation of the per network ﬂow set of encryption
keys for each hop will be done by the SHIELD network client. Thus, the complete end-
to-end path among the SHIELD end-users and the application servers will be unknown
to all the relays in the network. Since the routing scheme followed for the establishment
of communication among the SHIELD nodes of the TOR network will not follow any
speciﬁc rules, trafﬁc analysis from malicious users will be very hard to be achieved [8].
By ensuring the anonymity of the SHIELD users at network level, the SHIELD
Opportunistic & Ephemeral Negotiator will be used for establishing a mutual agree-
ment between the end-user clients and the SHIELD server. Through the exchange of a
mutually-agreed symmetric key between the end-user and the SHIELD server through
a 1-way SSL secure communication channel, end-to-end encryption between the sender
and the recipient is supported. The key agreement takes place on top of a completely
un-trusted network (although TOR provides anonymity, the risk of packet overhearing
from a third-party still exists). In order to achieve a shared key agreement the principles
of ephemeral Difﬁe–Hellman keys will be employed [9].
2.2
SHIELD Pseudo-Anonymization Application Layer
The Pseudo-anonymization Application Layer builds upon the functionality provided
by the operation of the Pseudo-anonymization Networking Infrastructure and is
responsible for the generation of discrete pseudonyms and pseudo-proﬁles and the
deployment of the Virtual Proxy for the interconnection to the FI-WARE Identity
Management General Enabler. Since a shared-key is already selected based on the
Difﬁe–Hellman key exchange method, a secure channel based on 2-way SSL is going
to be established over which the communication of the Pseudonimity Network Client
with the SHIELD Pseudonymizer will be realized.
An Innovative Approach for the Protection of Healthcare Information
213

In order to support pseydonymization of end-users, the generation of the discrete
pseudonyms and pseudo-proﬁles for each end user is required. These pseudonyms and
proﬁles consist the unique identiﬁers of the users that are used later on for the gen-
eration of digital certiﬁcates. In order to create these pseudonyms, a combination of
proper parameters has to be deﬁned, ensuring that the correlation that arises does not
correspond to any proﬁle that is publicly available on existing social or other type of
community networks. By creating such pseudonyms by the SHIELD Pseudonymizer, it
is ensured that the de-pseudonymization cannot lead to identiﬁcation of the end-user.
Untraceable pseudonymization is validated through the Social Clearance Component of
the SHIELD Server that will be based on existing state of the art tools, such as Maltego.
In case the evaluation of the produced pseudonym is successful, the SHIELD PKI
can be used in order to create, manage and distribute a digital certiﬁcate for the
pseudonymized user. The digital certiﬁcate is communicated and installed to the end
users’ PC/browser while it is also used in order to store the associations among the real
users and pseudonyms in an Encrypted Database.
Upon the successful installation of the certiﬁcate, the end user is able to access the
SHIELD server. Since this server acts as an intermediary Virtual Proxy for requests
from end-users seeking resources from the deployed technical implementations of the
FI-WARE Identity Management General Enabler, access is provided to the FI-WARE
Identity Management (IM) services. User identiﬁcation is achieved through the two-
way SSL communication and the produced pseudonym of the end user.
One critical issue that has to be tackled regarding the Virtual-Proxying of
FI-WARE Identity Management services is the fact that many authentication and
authorization implementations check the end-user’s IP. Since in our approach the IP is
continuously changing (because of the TOR anonymity), the Pseudonimity Network
Client will be responsible to conﬁgure the user’s browser in order to use a predeﬁned
HTTP proxy, which is bundled with the SHIELD Server and provides the end-user
with a predeﬁned validated IP address.
2.3
Context Aware Services
In addition to the services that are directly provided from existing implementations
within FI-WARE, access will be given to an additional set of context-aware services.
Part of these services regard personalized services targeted at the end-user associated
with a speciﬁc pseudonym and include access to personal data, view of statistics as well
as monitoring of the daily end-user activities. Another set of context-aware services
will be provided to authorized third-parties that will be able to resolve the established
association between the created pseudonyms and the end users.
3
Discussion
SHIELD suggests a new network and software architecture targeting at the provision of
high quality pseudonymized context-aware services. SHIELD will provide a holistic
framework for the provision of pseudonymized services in the healthcare domain,
214

based on: (1) the design of the networking architecture that guarantees the anonymity
of end-users and the protection of their personal data, (2) the dynamic creation of
unique pseudonyms for the SHIELD end users based on the design and development of
the SHIELD Pseudonymizer and (3) the deployment and operation of a PKI and
issuance of digital certiﬁcates per pseudonymized end user.
By combining and integrating the abovementioned technologies, and coupling
them with properly designed testing pilots, business planning and targeted dissemi-
nation, SHIELD will provide end-users with value-added services including: (1) pre-
venting non-authorized third-parties to trace the IP or the physical location of the user,
to intercept the personal data and the real identity of the end-user during his ﬁrst
interaction with the platform, and to trace back the association of the pseudonym to the
end-user; (2) preserving application and context coherence implementing secure log-
ging, audit trail and monitoring of all access to healthcare applications and services,;
(3) preserving the non-repudiation security requirement allowing authorized parties to
resolve the association between the pseudonym and the real identity.
SHIELD architecture and software paradigm can be used for the provision of
advanced pseudonymized services within the FI-STAR and FI-WARE platforms, thus
widening the opportunities to deploy new innovative services in the healthcare domain
by exploiting the provided extensions in these platforms.

Abstract. Healthcare services based on the Internet of Things (Health-IoT) has
great potential. The popularity of intelligent mobile medical devices, wearable
bio-medical sensor devices, cloud computing and big data analysis have dra-
matically changed the usage pattern and business rule of Health-IoT. The rapid
development of mobile solutions towards Health-IoT contains the risk of
security and privacy. In this paper, a comprehensive trustworthy mobile solution
based on architecture modeling with fuzzy-set theory towards Health-IoT is
proposed. In particular, the solution is an semantics-based and fuzzy set theory
mechanism to calculate trustworthiness for every stakeholders in mobility
ecosystem for Health-IoT. An analytic methodology is presented backed with
theoretical metrics and evaluated experimentally. The feasibility of the imple-

Introduction
The rapid development of modern Information and Communication Technologies
(ICTs) has led to a new circumstance of the social environment. The Internet of Things
(IoT) is heterogeneous Internet-based information architecture in the wave of devel-
opment [1]. The IoT connects all the ordinary physical objects to the Internet through
kinds of information perception devices. The perception devices in IoT are able to
exchange information with each other, and ultimately achieve the goal of intelligent
recognition, locating, tracking, monitoring and management [2].
The mobile device based on IoT has been widely used as a pervasive healthcare
gateway that collects data from the medical devices. Several connected healthcare
devices like body fat analyzer, blood pressure monitor, ECG and etc., have been used

in conjunction with the mobile gateway of IoT [3–5]. Plenty of the mobile applications
afford constant monitoring service of patient’s symptoms and needs, enabling physi-
cians to diagnose and monitor health problems wherever the patient is, either at home
or outdoors.
Mobile solution for healthcare on the basis of IoT (mHealth-IoT) offers a unique
opportunity to tailor and customize care services for individual patients health needs
and behavioral attributes. With the convenience of mHealth-IoT, rapidly increasing
demands of daily monitoring would be satisﬁed. However, the security and privacy risk
is increasing rapidly due to its armature. In order to develop and integrate effective
ubiquitous sensing for healthcare, trustworthiness as an important design goals should
be taken into account in future mHealth-IoT [6].
In this paper, to tackle with the risk of security and privacy emerging in mHealth-
IoT, a trustworthy mobile solution is proposed. Trustworthy fuzzy set theory evaluates
trustworthiness of stakeholders in ecosystem are discussed.
The rest of this paper is organized as follow: some related works are summarized in
Sect. 2, theoretical method for evaluation of stakeholders is presented in Sect. 3, and
conclusion and future work are discussed in Sect. 4.

Generally, an IoT system could be decomposed into three layers, which are sensor
(recognition) layer, network (transformation) layer and application (services) layer.
Traditional strategies, such as access control, are no longer suit for resolving security
and privacy issues of distributed system because of their centre-dependence and poor
scalability.
Trust is a multidimensional, multidisciplinary, and multifaceted concept. Common
to these deﬁnitions are the notions of conﬁdence, belief, and expectation on the reli-
ability, integrity, ability, or characters of an entity. To reduce and solve the risk, a
number of literature articles in terms of trust management in IoT domain were pub-
lished. A trustworthy IoT system or service relies on not only reliable cooperation
among layers, but also the performance of the whole system and each system layer with
regard to security, privacy and other trust-related properties. Ensuring the trustwor-
thiness of one IoT layer (e.g., network layer) does not imply that the trust of the whole
system can be achieved.
Trust management (TM) plays an important role in IoT [7]. It enhances user pri-
vacy and information security, and improves quality of services. A trustworthy
mHealth-IoT should consist of reliable mobile devices, provides secure communica-
tions, and preserves users’ privacy, part or all of the ways to gain user trust. In this
paper, a trustworthy mHealth-IoT is present in order to illustrate what trust properties
should be enhanced in order to achieve holistic trust management.
A number of studies pay special attention to TM in IoT. The main issues focus on
the following aspects: Secure framework and architecture [8, 9]; Secure data trans-
mission and communication [10, 11]; Privacy preservation [12, 13].Yan et al. [14]

Health-IoT. In another word, mobility of “things” (e.g. mobile medical devices and
mobile terminals) is not the kernel part of Health-IoT. Kang et al. [20] proposes an
innovative ecosystem and model for Health-IoT. In his study, a mobile application
market ecosystem is described, notion of application trustworthiness is deﬁned, case
study and experiment is implemented. He depicts a fundamental solution for mHealth-
IoT in the view of security and privacy. However, the role of mobile terminal has not
illuminates clearly; theoretical method and measurement for trustworthiness is difﬁcult
to utilize in mHealth-IoT. With advantage of his study, considering stakeholders, a
trustworthy mHealth-IoT is proposed in next section, which focuses on the evaluation
for stakeholders.

Trustworthy mHealth-IoT
A trustworthy mHealth-IoT should be operating in particular ecosystem, which consists
of trustworthy devices and trustworthy services. In the ecosystem, many roles in dif-
ferent society domains are involved. The theory of ecosystem was introduced:
“Products and services mainly ﬂow from means providers, through service providers,
to end users. Payments (obligatory or optional, depending on different cases) ﬂow back
from end users, through ﬁnancial sources, to the means providers and service pro-
viders. Thus a close-loop is established. It is exactly the “close-loop” feature that
makes the ecosystem economically sustainable. Win-win cooperation is enabled only if
every stakeholder’s beneﬁt is guaranteed” [21]. In the ecosystem, many roles in dif-
ferent society domains are involved. The major stakeholders in the ecosystem as fol-
lowing: Healthcare mobile service providers; Healthcare ﬁnancial sources; Content
providers; Telecom operators; Mobile devices providers; Mobile medical devices
providers; Mobile application broker and etc. [18, 21]. In this section, a trustworthiness
evaluation for every stakeholder is proposed based on Sugeno Integral of fuzzy set
theory.
3.1
Trustworthiness Evaluation for Stakeholders
In the view of TM, traditional solutions for Health-IoT, spend much effort to solve
problems at some points, such as recognition, transformation, storage, processing and
etc. All the key points belong to different stakeholders in ecosystem. Evaluating the
trustworthiness of stakeholders in ecosystem is a direct way for build up a trustworthy
mHealth-IoT. Stakeholder is abstract concept; it is difﬁcult to calculate its trustwor-
thiness directly. Sugeno Integral [22] always is used for evaluating reputation and

trustworthiness in TM. Hence, it helps us to solve the problem about trustworthiness
evaluation for stakeholders.

Introduction
The main components of a healthcare monitoring system are –Hardware, soft-
ware, System Interfaces, Data, services and people. The sensor data being col-
lected by the WSNs contains information about the health status of the patient
and stored in a database. Health status data commonly include information of
blood pressure, heart rate, distance traveled through walking/ running, playing
activities, and surroundings (e.g. room temperature). We are mainly focusing
on the medical data as an important asset in this report. The security require-
ments, threats and mechanism are proposed in the context of protecting Health
data. This review report addresses the security challenges in WSNs for health-
care systems. Section 2 discusses major security requirements to protect user’s
health related data in the most important and widely employed wearable system
to monitor physiological data of the user. Section 3 presents a list of possible
threats on the security and privacy of user’s data. Section 4 proposes various
mechanism to counter security threats identiﬁed in the Sect. 3. Section 5 oﬀers
some concluding thoughts and reﬂection on the ﬁndings of this study.

Security Requirements in a WSNs Healthcare System
Data Conﬁdentiality: The health data should be conﬁdential and available only
to the authorized doctors or other caregivers. A sensor network should not leak
sensor readings to neighboring networks. Data Integrity: It must be ensured that
content of the messages must remain unchanged throughout the process of data
recording to data storage and manipulation. Data Availability: In many sensor
network deployments, keeping the network available for its intended use is essen-
tial. Data Authentication: In WSNs healthcare applications, authentication
is a must for every medical sensor and the base-station to verify that the data
were sent by a trusted sensor or not. Data Freshness: Data freshness implies
that the patient physiological signs are captured in recent time, and thus, an
adversary has not replayed the old messages. Consent & Privacy: A User’s
consent/ permission is needed when a healthcare provider is sharing his/ her
health records to another healthcare consultant. Health information should not
be distributed without patient authorization. Persons are entitled to access and
amend their health records.
We considered some well-known wireless sensing healthcare applications to
analyze the status of security and privacy. It can be seen in the Table 1 that
there is low awareness of security and privacy in the wireless healthcare applica-
tion. UbiMon, LifeGuard not even raised the issue of privacy violation while
developing their system. Authors did not consider any security requirements for
this application. They did not even address the importance of security or their
intention to implement any in the future. CodeBlue and AUBADE discussed
the importance of data privacy but didn’t mention any mechanism to ensure it.
Authors of SATIRE made a weak assumption that the use of internet can guar-
antee proper availability without any adoption of secure mechanism. Authors of
AMON project [1] claimed to implement a mechanism to secure conﬁdential-
ity, integrity, authentication and privacy in their system. However, the technical
report does not mention anything explicitly about the security measures. The
entries in the Table 1 consist of: NA: the requirement is not acknowledged in the
report, NI: no mechanism is enforced to implement the security requirement, I:
a mechanism is used to implement security requirement, A: the requirement is
acknowledged in the report as a current/ future work.

Security and Privacy Issues in Wireless Sensor Networks for Healthcare

Security and Privacy Threats
This section describes potential security and privacy issues associated to a WSNs
healthcare application. These issues may impose severe threats in the absence
of proper security counter-measure. Private information of the user/ patient can
be leaked to the malicious party.
Eavesdropping or Snooping: This is a passive form of security attack, sug-
gesting simply that some entity is listening to (or reading) communications or
browsing ﬁles or system information. LifeGuard project uses 802.11b (IEEE
wireless local area network standard) over the internet to a central server. 802.11
provides no protection against attacks that passively observe traﬃc [7]. Frame
headers of the traﬃc messages are sent without any encryption and visible to
everybody with a wireless network analyzer. CodeBlue Technical report does
not mention whether the framework employs some cryptographic methods in the
upper layers of network.
Routing Attack: Kambourakis et al. [8] mentioned that CodeBlue is prone
to Sybil attack when it is operated in ad-hoc mode. In the case of Sybil attack
[9], a single node duplicates itself and presented in the multiple locations. The
attacking node acting as a publisher could advertise through its multiple false
identities that he has medical data to send. In the case of CodeBlue, an attacker
can alter the header of the ADMR packets changing one or more of the address
ﬁelds (senderAddr, destAddr, originAddr, groupAddr).
Masquerading or Spooﬁng: Masquerading is an impersonation of one entity
by another. AUBADE uses IEEE 802.11b for transmitting all the bio-signals
obtained from the sensors of the wearable. AUDABE system can be a subject to
spooﬁng as 802.11 networks do no authenticate frames. Attacker can modify the
sender address in ADMR packets in CodeBlue devices and camouﬂage its device
to make the others believe that s/he is someone else. A proper implementation
of ‘authentication services’ counter this threat.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) Threats: Denial of Service is some occasion that
diminishes or eliminates a network’s capacity to execute its expected function.
In the physical layer the DoS attacks could be network-jamming and node-
tampering. At link layer, collision, exhaustion can be executed to produce DoS
attack. Similarly, Network layer can be aﬀected with misdirection, black holes.
This attack can jam the network in LifeGuard, CodeBlue, etc. and disrupt
the normal service of the system.
Privacy Issues: The deﬁnition of privacy, which is adopted in this report, is
deﬁned by North Carolina Healthcare Information and Communication Alliance,
Inc. It deﬁnes privacy as “‘An individual’s right to control the acquiring, use or
release of his or her personal health information”’ [10]. CodeBlue, AUBADE,
LifeGuard, UbiMon neither address not implement any mechanism to protect
the privacy of the user. Authors in [11] discussed several questions related to pri-
vacy of medical data. The questions raised in [11] are (a) Who has the authority
to delete, add and edit information to health data? (b) What type of data,

226
V. Agrawal
and how much data, should be stored? (c) Where should the health data be
stored? (d) Who can view a patient’s medical record? (e) To whom should this
information be disclosed to without the patient’s consent?
As we have seen in the above section, there are potential security and privacy
threats exist in healthcare system. Each and every healthcare application is to
security and privacy threats. It is obvious that extensive security and privacy
research is needed in wireless healthcare application, which can ﬁll the security
gaps that we have discussed in the above section.
4
Security Mechanism
A wireless sensor network consists of a large number of tiny sensor nodes deployed
over a geographical area. These nodes have limited processing capability, low-
storage capacity and constrained communication bandwidth. Therefore, a set of
appropriate security mechanisms is proposed and analyzed by many researchers
in order to suit the requirements of medical WSNs. Consequently, the secu-
rity gap between the above security measures are still needs to be explored for
healthcare applications.
Encryption: Encryption can be used to ensure the conﬁdentiality of the data
and prevent eavesdropping/ snooping. In sensor networks, TinySec [12] is pro-
posed as a solution to achieve link-layer encryption and authentication of data.
Authors of SATIRE project [6] indicated the use of TinySec to ensure security
and privacy in their system.
Secure Routing: Karlof & Wagner [9] argued that sensor network routing
protocols are not designed with security as a goal. Ferng et al. [13] proposed
an energy-eﬃcient secure routing protocol for WSNs. Their protocol addresses
issues of delivery rate, energy balancing, and routing eﬃciency. It also includes
authentication and encryption mechanism in the data delivery. The µTESLA
(Timed Eﬃcient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication) protocol [14] can be used
for the authentication of broadcast messages with minimal packet overhead.
µTESLA is a routing protocol which provides authenticated broadcast for severe
resource-constrained environments.
Secure Authentication: Authentication mechanism can be used to ensure the
data/ requests are coming from the valid entity it is claiming to be. Guo et al.
[15] has proposed a certiﬁcate-less authentication scheme without bilinear pairing
while providing patient anonymity. Yu et al. [16] proposed password-based user
authentication scheme for the wireless healthcare system. The proposed scheme
consists of four phases, namely the registration phase, the pre-computing phase,
the authentication phase and the password change phase.
Freshness Protection: Perrig et al. proposed SPINS protocol [14] to ensure
data freshness in a WSN. Their protocol achieves both weak freshness –required
by sensor measurements, and strong freshness –is useful for time synchronization
within the network. SPINS uses nonce to achieve message freshness.
Regulation and Laws: United States law mandates that medical devices
meet the privacy requirements of the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and

traﬃc data or to make such data anonymous when it is no longer in use.

Discussion and Conclusion
The potential of Wireless sensor networks has been widely accepted in the health-
care system. However, advantages of sensor applications can be exploited eﬀec-
tively if the desired level of security and privacy can be ensured. It is found in
our study that almost all the WSNs healthcare applications lack a measure to
counter security and privacy challenges. Researchers are either ignoring the secu-
rity aspects or keeping it aside for the future works. This has created a major
security gaps in the existing healthcare solution. We presented a list of potential
threats to manifest the importance of proper acknowledgment of security and
privacy issues in the healthcare system. We also discussed possible mechanisms
to counter threats and ensure privacy of user’s data. The relationship among var-
ious security requirements, attacks and countermeasures, discussed in this study,
can be presented using Table 2. This table serves as a guideline to understand
the associated security requirement with each security threats and how can it be
mitigated using a security mechanism. Consequently, general public awareness
is a vital mechanism that must be given proper importance to address various
security and privacy issues. It can be extremely useful if people are educated
regarding security, privacy issues, existing laws and regulations.

Abstract. In this paper it is present a solution to improve the current endo-
scopic exams’ workﬂow. These exams require complex procedures, such as
using both hands to manipulate buttons and pressing a foot pedal at the same
time, to perform simple tasks like capturing frames for posterior analysis. In
addition to this downside, the act of capturing frames freezes the video. The
developed software module was integrated with the MIVbox device, a device for
the acquisition, processing and storage of the endoscopic results It uses libraries
developed by the PocketSphinx project to recognize a small amount of com-
mands. The module was ﬁne-tuned for the Portuguese language which presents
some speciﬁc difﬁculties with speech recognition. It was obtained a Word Error
Rate (WER) of 23.3 % for the English model and 29.1 % for the Portuguese one.

Introduction
Nowadays it is accepted by most healthcare professionals that information technologies
and informatics are crucial tools to enable a better healthcare practice. The Pew Health
Professions Commission (PHPC) recommended that all healthcare professionals should
be able to use information technologies in their workout [1]. Indeed the technological
evolution has led to an enormous increase in the production of diagnostic tests [2].
EsophagoGastroDuodenoscopy (EGD) and Colonoscopy occupy relevant positions
amongst diagnostic tests, since they combine low cost and good medical results. The
current endoscopic systems do not fully utilize the current advances in technology, and
require a multi-step process to perform simple tasks such as video acquisition and
frame capturing. A gastroenterologists needs to press a programmable button on the
endoscope to freeze the image and then press the pedal to capture and save the dis-
played image [3]. These procedures are not optimal and raise several issues, such as
limiting the range of possible movements of everyone involved and distracting the
gastroenterologist from the objective of the exam: diagnosing anomalies. A possible
solution to this problem could consist in adding a voice recognition module to the

video acquisition system, providing hands-free control. This module, named MIV-
control, will be integrated into the device named MIVbox.
The module should be speaker-independent and have a very low error rate, even in
noisy environments, and it should be able to capture audio from a microphone
continuously, so that it can run in the background unattended, without human inter-
vention. This requires automatic word segmentation to make recognition possible.
Barnett et al. [4] conﬁrmed that not every language can be recognized with the same
accuracy. Although no deﬁnitive theory is provided, they present data that conﬁrms
the claims. Some possible reasons for some languages being harder to recognize than
other include increased frequency of smaller words, language-speciﬁc phonemes, and
lack of training data [4].

Speech Recognition
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a process by which a computer processes
human speech, creating a textual representation of the spoken words [5]. Aymen et al.
presented the theoretical foundation of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for automatic
speech recognition that underpin most recent implementations [6]. There are several
HMM accomplishments, but the most mature ones are the Hidden Markov Model
Toolkit (HTK) [7] and the CMU Sphinx system [8]. HTK is a set of libraries used for
research in automatic speech recognition, implemented using HMM. Its last release was
launched in 2009 and since then it has been largely abandoned [7]. The CMU Sphinx
project started on 1990 and already produced 4 (four) versions of its recognizer [8–11].
Vertanen [12] tested both the HTK and the Sphinx systems with the Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) corpus and found no signiﬁcant differences in error rate and speed which is
corroborated by independent researchers [13]. Huggins-Daines et al. [14] optimized
SPHINX-II for embedded systems, primarily for those with ARM architecture. This
work has led to the creation of the PocketSphinx project, a Large Vocabulary Con-
tinuous Speech Recognition system developed at the CMU University as an open
source initiative [14]. The PocketSphinx project has been used for many different
idioms, from Native American and Roma [15], Mexican Spanish [16], Mandarin [17],
Arabic [18], and Swedish [19]. These examples show that the PocketSphinx system is
ﬂexible enough so that it is relatively easy for people with phonetics training to extend
it to other languages, with acceptable results. Harvey et al. [5] focused on the creation
of models and general optimization tasks, and managed to create a multilingual system
that has a 2-s processing time on embedded systems, with error rates below 30 % [5].
Kirchhoff et al. suggested other methods to improve the ASR systems’ performance,
such as including non-acoustic data [20].

Voice-Controlled Endoscopic Exams Acquisition
MyEndoscopy is a web-based system developed to link different entities and stan-
dardize the patient’s clinical process management, in order to promote sharing of
information between different entities [21]. It acts like a private cloud, with several
230
S. Afonso et al.

devices providing and using services via common protocols. As more health institu-
tions need this kind of services, it can be useful to pool users in common clouds, with
costs shared between all the institutions, increasing the scale at which services are
provided, to lower individual costs [21].
The MIVbox device is part of that system, and was developed to tackle the problems
that healthcare professionals face when performing endoscopic procedures, including
replacing the current analogue video acquisition with a more up-to-date integrated
digital system [21]. Currently, gastroenterologists use a pedal to capture relevant
frames. The main goal of the MIVcontrol module is to replace the pedal with voice
commands collected from a microphone that interact with the MIVacquisition module.
As presented on Fig. 1, the MIVacquisition module receives the video that is feed
directly from the endoscopic tower and provides it to all the other MIVbox devices [22].
By integrating the MIVcontrol module on the gastroenterologist’s workﬂow, the system
can perform frame capturing and video control on the ﬂy, without the need for any
extra buttons. In addition, it is much easier to extend it to accept new functionalities,
which stand for new commands.

Implementation
The creation of the speech model used in the MIVcontrol module requires annotated
audio and consists of two phases: creating the text model and creating the acoustic
model. The language model is a high-level description of all valid phrases (i.e. com-
bination of words) in a certain language. It may be classiﬁed either as statistical models
[23] or as Context-Free Grammars [24]. SphinxBase requires the grammar to be
deﬁned in Java Speech Grammar Format (JSGF) [25]. The statistical language model is
automatically created based on the command list. The dictionary is a map between each
command and the phonemes it contains. A phoneme is deﬁned as the basic unit of
phonology, which can be combined to form words. Since the list of required commands
is small, all the dictionaries were created manually. It is presented on Fig. 2 as
LmCreate. The acoustic model is trained using SphinxTrain and maps audio features
to the phonemes they represent, for those included in the dictionary.

The training performed by SphinxTrain requires previous knowledge of the dic-
tionary and a transcription for each utterance, in order to map each utterance to its
corresponding phonetic information. It is presented on Fig. 2 as AmCreate. The audio
is split into utterances by tracking silent periods between them, and processed to create
a set of features that feed into the HMM. The ﬁnal result is the most likely command
contained in its dictionary.
5
Discussion
The parameters that have a larger impact on the model’s accuracy, and so will be tested, are
the number of tied states used in the HMM and the number of Gaussian mixture distri-
butions. To test the accuracy of the model, 10-fold cross-validation is performed on the
data. The audio corpus in which the system was tested contained two languages, Portu-
guese and English, with a total of 1405 recordings, totalling 25 min of speech, recorded by
5 female and 7 male speakers, recorded in both noisy and quiet conditions. The vocabulary
used was chosen so that it would be useful for direct application is the context of endo-
scopic procedures. The results are presented as precision-recall matrices. The OTHER
label consists of unrecognizable commands or out-of-vocabulary predictions.
To the English model, the best results were obtained for 100 Gaussian mixture
distribution and 8 tied states (Table 1). This model has a Total Error Rate of 23.27 %,
corresponding to 128 errors in 550 commands.

For the Portuguese (pt-PT) model, the best results were obtained for 150 Gaussian
mixture distributions and 8 tied states (Table 2). This model has a Total Error Rate is
29.1 %, corresponding to 249 errors in 855 commands. The difference can be explained
by the fact that the similarity among the Portuguese commands is superior, and some
sounds might not be detected by the recognizer.

Conclusions
This paper presents a voice recognizer for a very small vocabulary to be used as a
command and control system, integrated on the MyEndoscopy system, leveraging the
capabilities of the CMU Sphinx project, particularly the PocketSphinx libraries. It was
created to respond to issues with the current solutions reported by gastroenterologists,
and can be presented as an alternative to cloud-based solutions, such as Google Speech
API. In a medical environment, cloud-based solutions pose certain challenges that
might degrade their desirability, such as security and privacy issues. Legal reasons on
systems that deal with sensitive data also have to be accounted with. Having a system
that can be installed inside the healthcare institutions’ network without external
dependencies is a plus for the reasons presented above. The results obtained required an
extensive tuning to the PocketSphinx parameters, particularly for the Portuguese
model. This tuning is necessary because the system was not designed to recognize
Romance languages like Portuguese one. Future work may involve the creation of
models adapted to each speciﬁc user, instead of the one-size-ﬁts-all approach followed
in this work.

Abstract. Pathological shaking of the body or extremities is widely known and
might occur at chronic diseases e.g. Parkinson. The rhythmical shaking, also
known as tremor, can be such intense that extremities are ﬂapping. Under certain
circumstances, healthy people also show a shivering and shaking of their body.
For example, humans start to shiver whenever it is too cold or if feelings such as
stress or fear become dominant. Some wearable devices that are in direct contact
to the body, such as smartwatches or smartglasses, provide a sensing func-
tionality of acceleration force that is sufﬁcient to detect the tremor of the wearer.
The tremor varies in frequency and intensity and can be identiﬁed, by applying
detection algorithms and signal ﬁltering. Former works ﬁgured that all endo-
therms show muscle vibrations. These vibrations occur in the condition of
sleeping as well as when being awake, or in unconsciousness. Furthermore, the
vibrations are also present when subjects are physically active, emotionally
stressed, or absolutely relaxed. The vibration itself varies in structure, amplitude,
and frequency. This paper shows that these muscle vibrations are measureable
by acceleration sensors attached to the user, and provides an outlook to new
applications in the future. It also proves that custom mobile devices are able to
detect body and muscle vibration and should motivate designers to develop new
applications and treatment opportunities.

Introduction
Muscle activity is important for a variety of processes that take place in human
organism. For instance, shivering is an unconscious movement of muscles to increase
the core temperature for compensating heat loss. Other examples for body-controlled
muscle contractions and vibrations would be the support of blood and liquid exchange
in the vessels and cells. This inﬂuence of vibrations and oscillations was addressed by
former work [1]. The effect of autonomous muscle activity is mainly visible at patients

with disorders of the muscle function, e.g., Parkinson disease or cerebral palsy patients.
Current technology in signal processing and sensor technics is able to detect patho-
logical muscle activity that is not even visible to the human eye. Moreover, it is
possible to measure that every muscle is vibrating, even if the person is calm or
sleeping [2]. This paper proposes new approaches for detecting microvibrations in a
mobile context for providing services in Wearable Computing, which are not only
applicable for patients but also for healthy people. Therefore, new interaction concepts
are presented as well as new measurement methods and hardware requirements are
being discussed. Future work is then outlined as a motivation for researchers to explore
the inﬂuences and dependencies of microvibrations on healthcare and other areas of
application.

Related Work
In 1944, Rohracher [2] explored very low amplitude muscular vibrations in endotherm
organisms. He was the ﬁrst scientist to refer to these small amplitude oscillations as
microvibrations. Rohracher used piezo-electric pick-ups to detect the muscular activity.
With these also known as phonograph needle sensors, he detected vibrations that where
present even in complete relaxation or sleep. Rohracher’s research has shown that all
endotherms generate these so-called microvibrations. Moreover, the vibrations could
also be measured even one hour after the dead of the organism. Rohracher also
measured variations in frequency and amplitude for different conditions, such as
temperature variations. He pointed out that low temperature leads to an increasing
frequency of vibrations. Marko [3] made microvibrations visible by magnifying them
400 times with a microscope. Pacela [4] evaluated ﬁve sensor technologies for the
measurement of human body surface vibrations. Pacela used besides a non-contacting
capacitance sensor a seismic (velocity) sensor, linear-variable-differential transformer
sensors and a miniature accelerometer. A second kind of body vibration is the so-called
tremor. Many works in the ﬁeld of vibration measurement mostly refer to this as a
pathologic body movement. However, Rohracher [2] has recommended differentiating
between microvibrations and macroscopic tremors. He has pointed out that in case of
healthy subjects, tremor only occurs in certain stimulus situations, such as excitement
and coldness, whereas microvibrations occur constantly. Furthermore, he has pointed
out that macroscopic tremor, that occurrs on patients with Parkinson’s disease, dis-
appears while sleeping or being in anesthesia.
Microvibrations in Current Research
Currently there are very few papers working on this topic. Recently, Bieber et al. [5]
identiﬁed sensor requirements for measuring biometric data with accelerometers. They
identiﬁed that accelerometers build in custom off-the-shelf hardware are able to mea-
sure data, such as heart rate. In this research a smartwatch was placed on the chest of a
lying or sitting user and captured data for short periods of time (15–30 s). The resulting
accelerometer data contained suitable heart rate information. The attempt of measuring
the pulse frequency in absolute rest showed frequencies in the Fourier spectrum that

where located clearly over pulse or breathing thresholds. These frequencies where
identiﬁed as small vibrations that occurred even in total relaxation. The authors expect
commercial smart devices (mobile devices with inertial sensors) to be capable to
measure microvibrations.
Characteristics of microvibrations presented by Rohracher [2]:
• Frequency between 7 Hz and 11 Hz
• Amplitude in total relaxation between 1 to 5 micro meter
• During muscle contraction the amplitude increases to ten times the rest value
• During psychological tension and bodily strain, the amplitude increases
• During fever or hyperthyreoses the frequency increases up to 14 Hz
• While sleeping the amplitude decreases about half of its value in wakefulness
• Medication can lower the amplitude
• Even up to 60 min after death, microvibrations are still measureable
• Can be measured at any body-part
• Only present in endotherm organisms
• Constantly measureable
3
Example Implementation
This section proposes three ways of detecting microvibrations using gyroscopes or
accelerometers. Therefore, three different positions had been chosen: (1) head place-
ment, (2) arm placement, and (3) leg placement. To perform the measurements, the
Invensense IMU-3000 gyroscope, which is built into the SensorTag from Texas
Instruments [7], and the Kionix KXTi9 accelerometer of the TI MetaWatch Strata were
used [8]. The gyroscope collects data with a resolution of 7-bit and a sampling rate of
100 Hz. The accelerometer was set to a 13-bit resolution with a sampling rate of 32 Hz.
Both sensor boards are light and relatively small. After dismantling the MetaWatch
board off its wristband, both devices could be placed at different body positions as
illustrated in Fig. 1. For measurement at the head, the devices were simply attached to a
pair of glasses. To perform the measurement at arm and leg, both devices were simply
laid down, thus not being affected by static ﬁxations (Fig. 2).

without adjustment (except the head placement). Placement positions were: (1) head placement,
(2) arm placement, (3) leg placement.

To collect the sensor data, the devices were connected via Bluetooth to an Android
smartphone. For this purpose a rudimentary app was implemented, which simply reads
out sensor data and saves it into a CSV ﬁle. After that, the analysis of the raw data
could be comfortably done. When the app was recording, the subjects were instructed
to sit down, while being as calm as possible. To obtain the signal information and to
calculate the frequency of each signal, a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) was per-
formed on each sensor axis with 2048 samples. The signals provide different fre-
quencies roughly between 4–11 Hz. The direct position of the body parts did not play a
signiﬁcant role. Nevertheless, the frequencies of the head are slightly lower than those
of the other parts. After more tests, it could be shown that the head data was very
similar, even by varying the recording setting, e.g., by lying down on the ground or by
bracing the head onto the arm on a table.

New Applications
This section discusses new ways on how to integrate the recognition and assessment of
microvibrations into new applications. The aim of these approaches is to measure
microvibrations with off-the-shelf hardware such as smartwatches, to provide services
to the user, which is derived off the vibration information.

On-Body-Detection
Wearable technologies are frequently used in medical applications. For instance, ac-
tigraphy or sleep recognition systems enable a measuring of human activity in activity-
counts. These systems determine a sleep state, whenever the activity count falls below a
pre-deﬁned threshold. As a result of this, actigraphy systems often detect sleep
whenever the hardware is doffed. To overcome this shortcoming, microvibrations can
be utilized to detect whether the hardware is worn or doffed. Similar effects occur on
fall detection systems and lead to unnecessary false detections.
Sleep Detection
Low microvibration signal amplitudes - in relaxation - could be used as a feature for
sleep detection. The technology is suitable to improve the capability of detecting short
periods of nightly awakenings. Moreover, most of the current actigraphy systems suffer
of underestimating nightly awakening [6]. Recent research proves the feasibility of
detecting the rapid eye movements (REM) sleep state via microvibrations [9]. Using
our proposed system to improve the algorithmic detection of sleep could signiﬁcantly
gain better results in sleep recognition.
Weight Abatement
Fitness applications or other technologies try to motivate the user to lose weight.
Physical activity is a major aspect in a successful therapy for patients for adiposity.
Microvibrations are also a kind of muscle activity, and deliver valuable information on
energy consumption. The progress in current technologies suggests that the inclusion of
relevant features of the muscle microvibration could improve, or support a therapy for
obese or overweight people.
Individual Medication
Microvibrations are depending on many parameters. However, current data gives rise
to the expectation that monitoring these vibrations would possibly provide essential
information on individual patients’ drug dosage.
Anomaly Detection
Based on the knowledge of microvibrations, varying amplitudes in the state of
unconsciousness possibly concludes to a better prediction of an anomaly for epilepsy
patients or patients with narcolepsy. Therefore, wearable devices could be used to
detect vibration amplitudes in a daily context for recognition of anomalies in sleep-like
situations.
5
Conclusions and Future Work
Currently, microvibrations are known in the ﬁeld of medical diseases, but not in the ﬁeld
of human physical activity recognition. It might be expected that new analyzing features
and algorithms combine the area of unconsciously movements and deliberately move-
ment to create new application ﬁelds and new scientiﬁc ﬁndings. The advantages of
measuring microvibrations with wearable technologies lie in the wide area of applica-
tion ﬁelds (e.g. sleep detection, anomaly detection etc.). Most of the results presented in

previous research where achieved by using stationary devices (e.g., [2, 4, 9]), and
therefore is not applicable to most real world scenarios. The aim of this paper was to
prove that microvibrations are measureable with mobile inertial sensors. Preliminary
measurements, presented here, with mobile CE (Customer Electronics) devices, namely
MetaWatch Strata and TI SensorTag, showed promising results for detecting microvi-
brations. These results are consistent and are matching with the ﬁndings of Pacela [4] in
terms of sensor accuracy and technology as well as measured frequency. However, for
future wearable application scenarios, the quality of recognition for microvibrations has
to be further evaluated. Therefore, the results of previous research on non-inertial
sensors (e.g. conducted by Rohracher [2]) have to be validated with a reconstructed
study with off-the-shelf wearable devices. This way, a comparison and evaluation of
both detection techniques would be possible. In addition, the connection between mi-
crovibration and sleep (or even diseases such as diabetes) are worthy to be investigated.
This could possibly lead to more insight on nightly hyperglycemia. Another ﬁeld of
interest that requires further research is the detection of stress or tension.

Abstract. The Ambient Intelligence (AmI) paradigm represents the vision of
the next wave of computing. By relying on various computing and networking
techniques, AmI systems have the potential to enhance our everyday lives in
many different aspects. One area in which widespread application of this
innovative paradigm promises particularly signiﬁcant beneﬁts is health care. The
work presented here contributes to realizing such promise by proposing a
functioning software application able to learn the behaviors and habits, and
thereby anticipate the needs, of inhabitants living in a technological environ-
ment, such as a smart house or city. The result is a health care system that can
actively contribute to anticipating, and thereby preventing, emergency situations
to provide greater autonomy and safety to disabled or elderly occupants, espe-
cially in cases of critical illness.

Introduction
Ubiquitous Computing and Ambient Intelligence (AmI) concepts refer to a vision of the
future information society in which human living environments will be pervaded by
intelligent devices that will be everywhere, embedded in everyday objects to provide
the functionalities to integrate computing and telecommunications technologies.
According to the vision of Mark Weiser [1] (considered the father of ubiquitous
computing), the most advanced technologies are those that “disappear”: computer
technology should become invisible, and the daily environment will enable innovative
human-machine interactions in which autonomous and intelligent entities will act in
full interoperability and will be able to adapt themselves to the user and even anticipate
user needs [2]. Such innovative paradigms make AmI technology a suitable candidate
for developing a wide variety solutions to real-life issues, including in the health care
domain.
In this regard, one open issue regarding AmI is related to recognizing unusual or
dangerous situations in order to anticipate health emergencies by monitoring users’
habitual activities and capturing their normal behavior. Such functionalities can be
implemented using systems based on machine learning techniques, which exploit
artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms to learn users’ habits by accumulating ‘experience’ on

their normal day-to-day activities in order to be able to recognize ‘abnormal’ situations.
A system able to anticipate danger before life-threatening situations arise would cer-
tainly lead to faster and more effective intervention when used to predict health
problems in time and can thus often save lives.
If we focus on the home, AmI services may be seen as a layer on top of the domotic
system, per se. In order to make the advent of genuine AmI applications possible, there
is a crucial need that the environment in which they act be fully interoperable [3].
However, the current immaturity of the ﬁeld of domotics and, more speciﬁcally, the
lack of deﬁnitions of application requirements, have led to the development of a large
number of ad hoc proposals, which unfortunately are often limited and difﬁcult to
integrate.

Related Works
A large body of literature underscores the currently great research interest in AmI and
methodologies for anticipating user needs. Chin [4] has classiﬁed three different
categories of rules for programming an AmI system: pre-programmed rules, user-
programmed rules, agent-programmed rules.
As regards the ability to identify user actions, Rashidi et al. [5] describe a system
that identiﬁes frequent behaviors using a powered Hidden Markow Model approach.
Aztiria et al. [6] propose a similar system based on pattern recognition to understand
users’ behaviors and act accordingly to automate actions and devices. Chen et al. [7]
present an interesting survey on user activity recognition.
Mileo et al. [8] uses logic programming techniques to reason about independent
living. Another rule-based approach has been proposed by Aztiria et al. [9], while Puha
et al. [10] provide a comparison between different methods for multiple people activity
recognition.

Activity Recognition and Anticipating Needs
At the core of such AmI systems is activity recognition [11], whose goal is to identify
user behaviors as they occur, based on data collected by sensors. In this regard, we
deﬁne a ‘scenario’ as a set of events occurring in the environment that are in some way
related to each other and are recognized as such through the mediation of the domotic
devices. Users must simply behave as usual within their living quarters, ignoring the
technology surrounding them.
In order to recognize such scenarios and anticipate the needs of inhabitants we have
built a system called DomoPredict, which is a software client component of the
DomoNet project [12]. DomoPredict is able to act in place of users, basing its actions
on the data collected while monitoring their behaviors.
DomoNet has the capacity to abstract the peculiarities of underlying, well-established
heterogeneous domotic technologies (e.g. KNX, Lon, UPnP, etc.), enabling them to
co-exist and interwork without eliminating their peculiar differences.

243

As shown in Fig. 2, DomoPredict is able to communicate with DomoNet and,
through it, send commands to, and receive notiﬁcations of any state change in, any
domotic device.
In particular, consistent with the AmI lifecycle (Fig. 1), DomoPredict functionalities
can be divided into 4 steps:
• Information Collection: when a device changes state, an update message is sent
from DomoNet to DomoPredict;
• Collected Information Analysis:
identifying sets of actions that may lead to the
recognition and creation of new scenarios;
• Analysis: recognizing if a new scenario is to be learned, or an existing one modiﬁed
or removed;
• Rules Execution: the system applies a learned rule by invoking DomoNet to execute
the corresponding commands to the appropriate domotic devices.
With the aim of learning as much information as possible, the system employs a hybrid
method that exploits the advantages of two machine learning paradigms: data-mining
and statistical approaches. Thus, the software is made up of two complementary,
interoperating modules: the association and the statistical rules managers.
3.1
Association Rules Manager
The association rules manager is responsible for learning scenarios made up of a set of
events or actions, called itemsets, habitually carried out by the user. These events are
related to each other in the sense that they occur together within a speciﬁed short time
interval, though they may be unrelated to any speciﬁc time of execution.
The manager applies a speciﬁc method for mining frequent sequences [13], in
particular, associative rules. This enables the generation of opportune rules using
Fig. 1. Scheme of AmI based system
244
V. Miori and D. Russo
www.ebook3000.com

binary partitions of the events determining the scenario being learned. An unsupervised
learning technique has been adopted due to its ability to discover recurring sequences
of sensor activities and in order to allow the creation of relationships and groupings
between similar data [14].
By way of example, the system can learn a scenario that includes the two events:
“switch on the light in the living room” and “switch on the TV”. Once the user has
switched on the light, it must be determined whether (s)he wants to turn on the TV as
well. To do this, it is necessary to calculate the probability that the performance of one
event (or group of events) implies execution of the other(s) in that same scenario.
The constraints of the Apriori data mining algorithm are used to deﬁne frequent
scenarios. The algorithm ﬁnds itemsets commonly performed by the user and generates
candidate action sequences via the standard method deﬁned as Fk-1 X Fk-1 [13].
Such procedure requires a stage of data preprocessing, so as to determine the
minimum set of events that enables recognizing the correct scenario.
Data mining algorithms are known to work well using large datasets. From this
prospective, the usual techniques would seem unsuitable for our purposes, because our
dataset is empty at startup and is populated in real time via the update broadcast
messages sent by DomoNet. The solution adopted to overcome this obstacle is to act on
the support parameter of the Apriori algorithm, bearing in mind that the few data
available initially could lead to the acquisition of erroneous habits. In order to limit
such inconvenience, the dataset is enriched with a new entry only when the Apriori
minimum support parameter is greater than a preﬁxed threshold. So, simply increasing
its value will make it more difﬁcult for a given scenario to be learned, thereby pre-
venting infrequent events from being considered.
When a change in learned habits or external factors occurs, the no longer valid
scenario is modiﬁed or removed by the system using the Apriori reinforcement process,
according to the newly acquired experience.
Lastly, decisions are translated into commands and sent to recipient domotic
devices, which together with any reactions on the part of the human occupants, modify
the initial settings.

3.2
Statistical Rules Manager
While recognizing and characterizing common normal activities, which account for the
majority of the scenarios generated, is clearly crucial to the system’s functioning, health
applications require the ability to identify personal preferences as well as other events.
Thus a statistical rules manager has been designed to learn scenarios that are not
captured by the association rules manager.
The data collected are recorded in tables, which indicate either the percentage time
a device is in a particular state, or the percentage time that certain events occur [15].
The scenarios captured by the statistical rules manager are:
1. Scenarios made up of one or more events usually occurring at the same time of day
or for a long period of time. If an action is performed every day at a certain time, we
can assume that a relation exists between the action taken and the time of the day in
question and we can thus perform it automatically.
2. Scenarios deﬁned by personal living parameters (e.g. room temperature), which the
system uses to conﬁgure the environment according the inhabitant’s personal
preferences.
4
Conclusions
Following a hybrid approach that applies both the data mining techniques of asso-
ciative rule learning and statistical learning methods mitigates their respective limita-
tions and leads to a more versatile and reliable domotic system.
The methods applied enable the system to anticipate user needs quite well, and
system performance improved over time, as new experience was accumulated. The
proposed method resulted also satisfactory in recognizing critical situations in advance.
To achieve more realistic results the prototype requires a dataset that is both more
extensive and more detailed. The data acquired through the environmental sensors
are simply not enough to achieve sufﬁciently reliability deductions. Such data must be
integrated with the information that can be captured via wearable or implantable
devices.
In the future it will be possible to design and develop smart environments able to
instantly recognize not only different individuals interacting with the system, but also
emotions subtly expressed by such individuals and respond to these emotions in an
adaptive, personalized way. Consequently, such systems will aid in improving human
health care by providing timely support and therapy.

Abstract. The currently unfolding Internet of Things (IoT) technologies will
enable health services that have higher quality and lower cost than those
available today. However, the large majority of the current IoT research and
development expects that the IoT “things” communicate wirelessly, leaving the
question of their energy supply and communication reliability more-or-less
open. The obvious alternative, wire line, has gained much less attention, perhaps
since it is too well known. In this paper, we present an energy-efﬁcient IoT
architecture for healthcare applications that leverages clinical and home care
scenarios, given their typically ﬁxed, stationary nature, as the mobility of
patients is in many cases conﬁned to a room or a building. The architecture is
based on intelligent, wired gateways that are power-efﬁcient and low-cost. The
gateways link wired/wireless medical sensors and hospital appliances to web
services, enabling hospital automation and widespread data collection and
aggregation of vital signs in a convenient, and cost-effective approach.

Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the extension of the current Internet services
where the mundane everyday things are connected to the Internet, in addition to the
already connected computers and smart phones [1]. This paradigm enables Electronic
Health (eHealth), Mobile Health (mHealth) and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL)
technologies that allow remote monitoring and tracking of patients living alone at home
or treated in hospitals. These technologies provide health workers with the ability to
check vital signs of patients from anywhere at any time [2].
In wireline, wireless, and hybrid situations, an IoT gateway could play an important
role in health-related IoT applications. Initially, such a gateway may securely and
reliably bridge legacy sensors and other medical equipment to traditional Internet
Protocol (IP) based networks, such as a hospital intranet. In the longer run, such
gateways may connect the devices to a (private) cloud-based service, allowing data

aggregation and sensor fusion across multiple sensors and all patients, both in hospitals
and home care environments.
The IoT gateway may also be made responsible for intelligent processing and
partial data aggregation of the vital signs signals, along with protocol conversion from
the proprietary or primitive sensor data formats to those used IP based networks. When
real-time asynchronous communication capabilities are desired, the WebSocket pro-
tocol [3] proves being useful by providing socket like capabilities for the Web.
Another potential beneﬁt of the proposed approach is that sensors and actuators for
both building automation and clinical appliances may be powered and networked by
PoE (Power over Ethernet) [4] enabled technology. This allows building a Smart
Hospital system where the medical devices and building automation, including safety
and security, may become integrated. Furthermore, in the future even patients’ own
devices, such as cell phones, may be integrated to the system, increasing their
awareness and self-responsibility of their situation.
In this paper, we propose an IoT architecture for healthcare applications based on
energy-efﬁcient web-enabled gateway design customized for health related data pro-
cessing and transmission. The proposed architecture focuses on enabling wide-spread
data collection from both wireless and wireline sensors, not only from the medical
world but also from e.g. the building safety and security systems, in a uniﬁed way. The
combination of this two realms of healthcare services and smart hospital realizations by
taking advantage of PoE and web of things technologies represent a convenient, and
cost-effective approach to healthcare services.

Related Work
In [5], a WebSocket based monitoring system for sensor activity over a 6loWPAN
(IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) network is proposed for
feedback on building energy consumption, the WebSocket client is implemented in the
sensor gateway and a web user interface based on HTML5 is used. The gateway
however, does not serve as an energy source for the sensor nodes, leaving them to
depend on batteries or third party power sources to work. In [6], authors present design
and optimizations of a low power wireless gateway node that bridges data from
wireless sensor networks to Wi-Fi networks on an on-demand basis. These works do
not consider the use of intelligent processing of health related data on gateways.
Ultimately the gateways in these works are used as connection points to external web
servers instead of embedding the web connectivity on the gateway itself as proposed in
this paper.

Motivation
IoT applications are based on the extension of Internet to resource-constrained network
nodes that cannot take advantage of existing web services due to their high overhead
and intricacy. Resources are accessed through RESTful interfaces in synchronous
request/response fashion using methods such as GET, PUT, POST and DELETE and

are identiﬁed by Universal Resource Identiﬁers (URIs) which allow for short lived
transmissions only [7]. However, monitoring bio-signals required to estimate the
overall user’s health condition necessitates a constant connection for the non-stop
transmission of live data from continuous and pulsed signals such as Electrocardiog-
raphy (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Electroencephalography (EEG), respiratory
and heart rate. Each signal has a different bandwidth as shown in Table 1. Electrical
activity often requires band-pass and notch ﬁltering to remove baseline wandering,
electric hum noise and motion artifacts. Depending on the need, the signal could
be processed for feature extraction. In addition, classiﬁcation of normal, deviant, risk
and high risk conditions are performed in order to send notiﬁcation to caregivers in
order to take appropriate actions before a catastrophic event occurs. Many of these
functions could be performed on the gateway in order to alleviate the burden that the
sensor can carry.
A typical building automation system for hospitals is usually designed without
taking into account the health data generated by biomedical sensors. Yet, a trend in
modern healthcare is to go beyond the scope of traditional building management and
integrate all kinds of data sources into a big data cloud repository for performing
advanced analytics, improve forecasting and prioritize actions for increasing the bottom
line while improving health services quality. As an example, room sensors sense the
needs and preferences of staff and patients and allow to move from a traditional nurse
call system based on buttons ﬁxed to a wall to intelligent context aware nurse call
system based on detecting hazardous situations (e.g. when a patient’s temperature rise
into fever or an abnormal heart condition is detected).
4
Architecture
The intelligent gateway proposed features processing and web software components
customized for the handling and transmission of healthcare related signals such as vital
signs. On the sensor side, the gateway takes care of translation layers to accommodate
vendor agnostic sensors using different communication protocols.
The system architecture is shown in Fig. 1. The biomedical sensors used for
assessing physiological status serve as one of the data inputs to the system. These are
wired or wireless sensors for biometrics such as ECG, EMG, EEG, temperature,
pressure, heart rate, position, respiration rate, glucose levels, complete blood count, etc.

These sensors are connected to the gateway which receives the data, executes signal
processing and/or feature extraction and forwards relevant information to a server,
database or a directly to a web client.
In addition to remote patient monitoring, a smart building system is integrated
consisting of IoT nodes used for building automation. These include traditional
lighting, public address, access control and HVAC as well as hospital centric appli-
ances namely next-to-bed controls and context aware applications such as intelligent
nurse calling. The envisioned system is energy efﬁcient by harnessing the PoE capa-
bilities of the gateway, which allows for powering actuators and sensors directly
without recurring to a different power grid or AC outlets. The back-end of the system
consists of the two remaining components, the PoE enabled switch and a cloud
computing platform that includes broadcasting, data warehouse and Big Data analytics
servers, and ﬁnally Web clients as a graphical user interface for ﬁnal visualization.
4.1
Medical Sensors
Medical sensors capture signals from the body used for treatment and diagnosing of a
medical state. Examples are ECG, EMG and EEG signals for analyzing heart, muscles
and brain conditions. The sensor contains transducers and electrodes for acquiring
electrical signals that are converted to digital form using an analog front-end. The
signal is then transmitted to the gateway via wireless or wired communication protocols
such as Serial, SPI, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or IEEE 802.15.4. The transmitted data contains
information about the number of channels used and other status data such as lead-off
detection.

WebSocket server for streaming data directly to web applications, or to interface to
other broadcast servers. The WebSocket connection relies on TLS/SSL to provide
encrypted, end-to-end secure client and server communications.
For the gateway role, we have designed a hardware platform known as Ell-i [8]
which is an open source Arduino like development platform for ﬁxed things that
implements IEEE 802.3 at Power-over-Ethernet standard for 1–35 watts power con-
sumption range. A DC/DC converter on board converts 48 V into 5 V and/or 3.3 V
needed by the Microcontroller Unit (MCU), and an extra power supply converter is
used for providing bulk power to the wired sensors and actuators of the system such as
high-power LEDs, solenoids or electric motors. The gateway is designed to be low-cost
in order to be massively deployed along a hospital (e.g. one gateway in every room or
for every bed) so that low power wireless sensors beneﬁt from small coverage area. The
gateway receives commands over Internet to execute different tasks such as start
streaming of sensor data which include processing and transmission over the Web-
Socket interface.
4.3
Smart Hospital Framework
The networking capabilities of the gateway can serve multiple roles in addition to
monitoring patients. The same protocols used for connecting medical sensors are used
in a similar way for managing building automation systems such as lighting, access
control, indoor PA systems and HVAC controls and other more clinical centric as in the
case of ambient-intelligent nurse calling systems. This setup enables the centralization
of data acquisition not only for patient health data but also for hospital building
management of an integrated Smart Hospital framework. The gateway serves not only
as a managing node for the smart hospital controls but also as a smart power source by
harnessing the power coming from the PoE cable. This makes the system more energy-
efﬁcient and practical compared to other architectures that use embedded solutions such
as Raspberry Pi [9] as web servers.
5
Experimental Results
A test have been designed to assess the performance and practicality of the setup. We
use the Ell-i platform with an e-health daughter board that includes signal conditioning
circuitry to acquire ECG data from electrodes attached to a test patient (Fig. 2a). The
data is digitally ﬁltered in the gateway to remove power line noise and is streamed over
Internet using the embedded WebSocket server via Ethernet. A JavaScript client
plots the near real-time chart (1 s delay) of the signal (Fig. 2b). A set of commands is
implemented to control transmission start-stop. Future work includes the expansion of
the command set into a complete API for gateway management. The energy source
comes from the PoE enabled Ethernet cable connected to the gateway which also
powers the sensors.

The signal is sampled at 500 SPS with 12-bit resolution. Samples are packetized
into WebSocket messages of size 800 bytes and sent at an average rate of 1 KB/s. The
cost of the system is estimated in $200 USD per patient.

Conclusions
We believe that focus on the IoT gateway design for healthcare applications represent
an opportunity to solve IoT architecture challenges such as web connectivity, power
efﬁciency and Smart Hospital integration. In this paper, an IoT architecture have been
proposed that uses PoE powered gateways to serve as a bridge for medical sensors and
hospital building automation appliances to IP based networks and cloud computing
platforms. The proposed design of the gateway does processing and data aggregation of
vital signs and includes streaming web server. In addition, the gateway harness the
energy provided by the PoE enabled Ethernet cable to power sensors and actuators. The
gateway is designed to be low-cost and allows massive deployment along the hospital
facilities that together with PoE enabled network infrastructure result in an energy-
efﬁcient architecture for healthcare in hospitals and homes.

Abstract. The Childhood protection is a subject with high value for the society,
but, the Child Abuse cases are difﬁcult to identify. The process from suspicious
to accusation is very difﬁcult to achieve. It must conﬁgure very strong evi-
dences. Typically, Health Care services deal with these cases from the beginning
where there are evidences based on the diagnosis, but they aren’t enough to
promote the accusation. Besides that, this subject it’s highly sensitive because
there are legal aspects to deal with such as: the patient privacy, paternity issues,
medical conﬁdentiality, among others. We propose a Child Abuses critical
knowledge monitor system model that addresses this problem. This decision
support system is implemented with a multiple scientiﬁc domains: to capture of
tokens from clinical documents from multiple sources; a topic model approach
to identify the topics of the documents; knowledge management through the use
of ontologies to support the critical knowledge sensibility concepts and relations
such as: symptoms, behaviors, among other evidences in order to match with the
topics inferred from the clinical documents and then alert and log when clinical
evidences are present. Based on these alerts clinical personnel could analyze the
situation and take the appropriate procedures.

Introduction
The health care information systems had evolved strongly and with the recent imple-
mentations of the electronic health record these information systems interoperate
together and allow us to access patient information within of multiple healthcare
organizations. This aspect brings new opportunities to develop new technologies to
promote more patient or health care services beneﬁts. Since health care information is
highly sensible there are important aspects that cannot be neglected, such as: patients
privacy, medical conﬁdentiality, conﬁdentiality of the clinical procedures and legal
aspects. This context is prominent when we’re dealing with child abuse matters. Child
abuse cases are difﬁcult to identify since they are more pervert and dissimulated [1].
When clinical personnel identify evidences by diagnosis in order to formulate the

accusation these evidences are not strong enough to do it. On the other hand, we
assume that this difﬁculty could lead to a substantial number of cases that aren’t
identiﬁed. To address this problem we’ve developed a child abuse critical knowledge
monitor system that based on medical expert knowledge alert and log when child
abuses evidences are present in clinical documents. This is done automatically by the
system using information retrieval and text mining techniques which allows to trans-
form text in tokens, from tokens we infer topics, then we match them with an ontology
that supports the child abuse evidences as concepts and ﬁnally, when there are present
in documents clinical evidences of child abuse the system alerts and logs these evi-
dences for further analysis by clinical personnel. In the Sect. 2 we explain what implicit
considerations we should consider in patient privacy and health care information
security, in Sect. 3 we deﬁned the health care critical knowledge, in Sect. 4 we explain
the research methodology that this research is based, Sect. 5 we describe the compo-
nents of the child abuse critical knowledge monitor system model, in Sect. 6 we’ll
present the preliminary results of this research, ﬁnally, in Sect. 7 we’ll describe the
contribution to health care information systems.

Privacy and Health Care Information Security
2.1
Information Security and Privacy
Information is valuable for any kind of organization and when there are rights involved,
such as: patient privacy, medical conﬁdentiality, and information that could stigmatize
persons in social context like health care, the needs of information preservation are
even higher. Information security consists in the preservation of the security properties
of information and based on many standards and work published in this ﬁeld, we
normally identify a set of three properties there are the core of information security:
conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of information [2, 3]. In health care its easy to
recognize these properties but we have to reinforce them with the right of privacy that
cannot be affected by the promotion of the information security properties. In a concise
form, we’ll describe each of these aspects.
Conﬁdentiality. It means that any information that is exchanged or stored by the
systems is secret and only the authorized persons can access to it. In health care this
property is fundamental because in all phases of the clinical process exists information
exchange and can only be accessed by authorized personnel.
Integrity. Keep the integrity of information is keeping its accuracy, i.e., there should be
guaranties that some modiﬁcation of the information is intentional and made by autho-
rized personnel. In this objective, we need three actions, not allow unauthorized modi-
ﬁcations, keep updated the authorized personnel and keep the accuracy of the information.
Availability. It means that the information should be accessible permanently at all the
time. In health care the access to the patient information could be vital to him, e.g. An
anesthesiologist should have access to information of the patient about allergies and
other diseases since that with anesthesia could lead the patient to a complicated situation.

Privacy. Privacy, more than an information security property, it’s a right. In health care
we should consider the privacy of the patient, medical and non-medical personnel. For
this reason no mechanism implemented to support the information security properties
could affect the privacy that consists in maintaining the secrecy of personal information
which force to get it free from monitoring and unauthorized access. Typically, to access
to the patient information a consent declaration is needed.

Health Care Critical Knowledge
The development of standards of health care software is a big step to the interopera-
bility between information systems in this area. There are, at least, six entities that have
developed standards in this ﬁeld: The American Society for Testing and Materials with
ASTM-E31, The American National Standards Institute with ANSI-HL7, The Euro-
pean Committe for Standardization with CEN-TC251, The International Organization
for Standardization with ISO-TC215, The Association of Electrical Equipment and
Medical Imaging Manufactures with NEMA-DICOM and IEEE with multiple stan-
dards [4]. With the evolution of the health care information systems the access to
patient information using Electronic Health Record Systems (EHRS) is facilitated, e.g.
Urgency treatment data, health monitoring data, among others. According to the health
domain analysis report from the technical committee from HL7 about security and
privacy of health care information, particularly, in exchange of information between
information systems and according to HL7 Security and Privacy Ontology was possible
for us to identify critical knowledge concepts in health care domain [5, 6]: Substances
abuse, Sexual abuse and domestic violence, Genetic disease, Sexual transmitted dis-
ease, Sickle Cell, Sexuality and Reproductive, HIV/AIDS, Psychiatry and Taboo [6].
From this, we explore the subject General Abuses with the focus on the child abuse and
based on regulations and legal documentation we have constructed an ontology that
maps the concepts: symptoms, behaviour and other evidences of child abuse [7], see
Fig. 1.

Research Methodology
For the different phases and objectives of this research we have used multiple research
techniques: survey literature techniques, content analysis and proof of concept in
Design Research context.
4.1
Design Science Research
“Design Science research is a research paradigm in which a designer answers questions
relevant to human problems via the creation of innovative artefacts, thereby contrib-
uting new knowledge to the body of scientiﬁc evidence. The designed artifacts are both
useful and fundamental in understanding that problem” [8].
Child Abuse Monitor System Model
257

The design science research has its roots in the sciences of the artiﬁcial. Artiﬁcial as
something that is created by humans that doesn’t exists in Nature. Design Research is
fundamentally a problem-solving paradigm. It consists in seeking innovation through
ideas, practices, technical abilities and products obtained from a set of routines such as:
analysis, design, implementation, and use of information systems concerning the
effectiveness and efﬁciency achievement on organizations. The outputs forms of
Design research could be: constructs (vocabulary and symbols), models (abstractions
and representations), methods (algorithms and practices), and instantiations (imple-
mented and prototype systems) [8].
5
Child Abuse Critical Knowledge Monitoring System
The model of the system is deﬁned by four components: the knowledge capture
component, the critical knowledge ontology component; the critical knowledge
repository component; and the alert and log component. Each component is based on a
variety of information systems ﬁelds [10, 11].
Fig. 1. Child abuse ontology

5.1
The Knowledge Capture Component (KC)
The knowledge capture component requisites are: extracting tokens from documents in
a variety of formats, such as text and audio. Additionally, the implemented system
supports other formats: video (extracting sound and text within the video), webpages,
among others; and transform the tokens extracted in such format that could be
searchable concerning the privacy and conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of
documents. In order to do it, we have implemented a topic model approach using two
methods, latent Dirichelet [12–14] and Pachinko allocation model (PAM) [15, 16]. The
PAM has been chosen because it can establish relations between topics and topic
descriptors. The use of the topic model approach is fundamental because allows to
driven topics from documents and ignore (because of its lower occurrence within a
document) personal data (names, contacts and addresses) complying with the privacy
and information security properties. To use topic models from the extracted tokens
from the documents we needed to ﬁlter [17] them, essentially, tokens less than four
(conﬁgurable) characters and trivial discourse tokens such as “and”, “or”, punctuation,
among others. As an output of this component we get a searchable set of descriptors
clustered by topics that co-occur in the document.
5.2
The Critical Knowledge Ontology Component (CKO)
The critical knowledge ontology component requisites are: allowing the editing of the
critical ontology; and matching the ontology with the output of the knowledge capture
component. This component uses Portégé Editor and Portégé API, see acknowledg-
ments, for the matching procedure with the topic descriptors.
5.3
The Critical Knowledge Repository Component
The critical knowledge repository component requisites are allowing the storage of the
outputs from the KC and CKO. This component uses a document management tool
with the control version capability. The control versions could be useful in future
implementations and we could analyse multiple diagnosis of the same patient in an
historical perspective.
5.4
The Alert and Log Component
The alert and log component requisites are: alerting the user by email of the probability
of the document containing evidences about a child abuse; and register the evidences
identiﬁed by the system of each document for further analysis. The system should
select what cases should trigger an alert or register only. In order to do this we’ll use
artiﬁcial intelligence classiﬁcation algorithms very well tested and implemented to
assess the evidences and give value to the sensibility of the document in this context.

Preliminary Results
We have done tests in the laboratory only. The system is capable of identifying evi-
dences within a document in many formats and in Portuguese and English languages,
see Fig. 2. Documents with no relation to the subject of child abuse were tested, too,
and they produce negative results, i.e., the system didn’t identify evidences on these
documents. The next step will be testing the system in real context. We’ll test the
system with documents from child abuse suspicion cases and confront the results with
cases that was formulated an accusation. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the system
by component we’ll use the typical assessment models of knowledge management
systems [18].

Contributions of This Research
We propose a decision support system that addresses the problem of child abuse case
identiﬁcation. This subject is highly sensitive and valuable to the society and the
community. This research has produced a child abuse ontology that could have many
applications. In the information systems ﬁeld, we bring to discuss the knowledge
security: can we deal with knowledge security like we do with information security?
The sensitivity of knowledge is fundamental when dealing with knowledge
preservation?

Abstract. Todays IoT solutions are typically delivered by domain-
speciﬁc solution providers. In these solutions, components are highly
customized for speciﬁc project requirements, limiting their users to the
oﬀerings of their providers. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a novel mechanism that opens the market for OEMs and third-party
developers. This paper introduces the IoT Application Market, where a
range of stakeholders can distribute, sell, share and contribute features
for lightweight device-speciﬁc IoT applications. Based on the oﬀerings in
the IoT Application Market, users can buy applications and deploy them
in their environment through self-service.

Introduction
The overall process of delivering an IoT solution is typically orchestrated by
solution providers for speciﬁc projects [1,8]. Since this delivery process is mostly
vendor-speciﬁc, a big challenge in the Internet of Things domain, is to establish
an environment that allows various stakeholders to share, contribute and distrib-
ute applications collaboratively. The scale of IoT solutions can range from a sim-
ple application that monitors and reacts to a temperature sensor, to a full-blown
enterprise application that manages and controls a set of buildings. In this paper
we focus on lightweight applications that can be executed on gateways [9–11],
which are used to connect heterogenous devices and handle resources eﬃciently.
These lightweight applications are software services that carry out various tasks
autonomously by executing application code directly on the embedded runtime
environment of the device, resulting in a small footprint in terms of resource
and memory consumption. The drawback of this approach is that the actual
development of these gateway-dependent applications requires deep knowledge
of the runtime environment, which signiﬁcantly increases the eﬀorts for develop-
ment, and limits the involvement of more developers. As a result providers are

interested in distributing and selling their applications to a broad audience to
cover their eﬀorts. To save time and costs as well as expand their market cov-
erage, providers are eager to collaborate with other stakeholders to reuse their
solutions, which will only work in an ecosystem that allows not only distribution
but also a model to collaborate.
In this paper we present a novel ecosystem, where application providers can
share, contribute to and distribute IoT applications. The core idea is to real-
ize an IoT Application Market, that opens the application delivery process to
OEMs and third-party developers. To facilitate and integrate the oﬀerings of
the mentioned stakeholders, the market supports application providers to form
collaborations with other stakeholders to create and distribute applications. Fur-
thermore the market allows users to search for suitable applications, purchase
and deploy them in their local environment through self-service.
The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents a motivating industrial use
case, Sect. 3 illustrates the overall approach, Sect. 4 describes the implementation
details, in Sect. 5 the related work is compared, and ﬁnally the paper concludes
in Sect. 6.

Motivation
This work is motivated by a real-world scenario in Building Management Sys-
tems (BMS). The scenario is based on a case study we conducted in our lab
in collaboration with an industrial partner. In the case study we have identi-
ﬁed the following: generally a BMS provides eﬃcient management of building
facilities to save energy and reduce operational costs. A BMS consists of a vast
number of sensors, other smart devices and a platform that connects and han-
dles these resources and is developed by an Application Provider for a speciﬁc
Customer. During the process of delivering a BMS, the provider gathers infor-
mation about the target building, installs and integrates suitable hardware into
an infrastructure and ﬁnally connects it to a platform that provides speciﬁc
control and management applications. This approach has the following limita-
tions: (i) the customer is limited to the applications and services oﬀered by
his provider, and (ii) providers have to develop tailored applications based on
customer demands and their respective installed solution, which is both time-
and cost-ineﬀective. To address these limitations we want to open the process of
developing customer speciﬁc applications to the following contributing stakehold-
ers. Third-party developers develop and oﬀer lightweight applications that run
on speciﬁc IoT devices. Based on the installed device-set, a customer can choose
suitable applications. This gives the customer more ﬂexibility and the provider
the opportunity to outsource some of the application development. OEMs pro-
vide complete applications or just contribute features that are tailored for speciﬁc
hardware devices. These oﬀerings can be reused by both third-party developers
and providers for new requirements or diﬀerent physical environments. Based
on this scenario we identiﬁed the following requirements: (i) a market-based
collaboration and distribution environment, and (ii) a solution to manage the
deployment and execution of lightweight IoT Applications.

IoT Application Market
In order to address the previously mentioned requirements we propose an app-
roach that consists of the following key components: IoT Application, IoT Appli-
cation Market and IoT PaaS.
Fig. 1. IoT Application lifecycle
In this paper we focus on lightweight IoT Applications, which are used to
automatically tune building facilities, acquire data from diﬀerent sensors, mon-
itor devices, and automatically report a certain device status. In our approach,
an IoT Application is represented as a self-contained archive with corresponding
metadata, containing the following information: (i) a Name that uniquely iden-
tiﬁes the application, (ii) a natural language Description that can be read by
humans and a structural one that can be understood by software (i.e. the mar-
ket) in order to provide a reliable search, (iii) Provider name and id, who created
and uploaded the application, (iv) a list of Suitable Devices the application can
be deployed and executed on. This list can always be updated by the provider,
to react on new emerging compatible devices, and (v) a Version number that
uniquely identiﬁes the current release of the application.
The lifecycle of an application is depicted in Fig. 1 and has the following
states: Transient, Idle, Deployed and Expired. An application that is purchased
is in state Transient. Once the application is licensed by the market it is in
state Idle. As soon as the user deploys the licensed application on the gateway
device, the gateway checks if the license is valid, initializes the startup process
and sets the state to Deployed. If the gateway detects that the license is expired,
it interrupts the execution and sets the application to Expired.
3.1
IoT Application Market
The IoT Application Market represents an ecosystem, where Application
Providers oﬀer and users browse and retrieve applications. The overall process,
involved components and stakeholders are depicted in Fig. 2. The market stores
the uploaded applications in the IoT Application Repository, which is an open
service repository that hosts applications as self-contained archives with corre-
sponding metadata. The market provides the following core components.
The Stakeholder Management is responsible for handling the management of
users, their authentication and authorization within the market. We identiﬁed

Fig. 2. IoT Application Market and IoT PaaS
the following groups of users based on [3]: Application providers develop appli-
cations and upload them to the market. Additionally the provider can decide to
share features with other users of the market and form a collaboration. Users
invited to collaborations are called contributors. Contributors can reuse shared
features for other or new applications and provide new or improved code for
the collaboration. Based on this collaboration, involved parties can decide if
and how they want to distribute the outcome and decide on an appropriate
revenue sharing model. Users of the market, which are not involved in the devel-
opment process are called customers. Customers browse the market and search
for interesting and suitable applications e.g. if the release of an application can
be deployed and executed on the owned IoT devices. The Collaboration Manage-
ment supports and manages the collaboration among the application provider
and contributors. For each group of users that formed a collaboration, the market
provides a speciﬁc private repository, where the group can store their application
code and other required artifacts. This repository can only be accessed by the
members of the collaboration and provides the basic features of a conventional
source code management (SCM) and revision control system. Additionally it sup-
ports diﬀerent plugable metrics to track the contribution of each member of the
collaboration, e.g. one of the easiest models, calculates the contribution based
on the number of committed code-lines. The Collaboration Management uses
the data provided by the respective metric to calculate the revenue share. The
Distribution Management monitors and controls the distribution of applications.
A monitoring component keeps track of all downloads and a control component
regulates if a user is allowed to download a speciﬁc application, based on historic
data e.g. punctual payment of bills. The Licensing component governs the use
or redistribution of an application. A typical license in our model grants the user
permission to use an application on a deﬁned set of ﬁeld devices.
After downloading the application from the market and deploying it on the
gateway, the user needs the corresponding license ﬁle that triggers the actual
instantiation and startup process of the application.

COLT Collaborative Delivery of Lightweight IoT Applications
269
Based on the user’s inputs (e.g. used device group, subscription schema) the
market generates a license ﬁle that can now be deployed on the gateway. The
gateway detects the deployed license and triggers the startup process of the cor-
responding application. During the execution of the application the gateway may
detect that the license is expired and passivates the execution. The user can now
decide if he wants to extend the license or undeploy the application from the
device. In case the user wants to prolong the license he can retrieve an extended
license in the market. To keep track of multiple releases of the same applica-
tion the market uses a Versioning component. Since in the market we need to
handle a vast amount of applications, we need an eﬃcient mechanism to deal
with diﬀerent releases of the same application. Therefore, whenever a provider
uploads a new release to the market, he has to decide if it is either a major
(signiﬁcant improvement) or minor (bug ﬁxes) release. This approach has the
following advantages: (i) developers can decide for which release they want to
provide updates and which are no longer supported, (ii) users can easily decide
which release is the most suitable for their environment, and (iii) the market can
notify the user about updates or known issues for a certain release.
3.2
IoT PaaS
IoT PaaS [7] is a domain-independet Platform as a Service framework. In gen-
eral, IoT solutions are highly domain-speciﬁc, so the IoT PaaS framework is build
to be generic and extendable enough to be used in diﬀerent IoT domains. The
framework provides essential platform services on cloud that can be used and
extended by IoT solution providers. Additionally IoT PaaS oﬀers a registration
point for devices, gateways and control applications, to handle the vast num-
ber of IoT resources. This registration point is the IoT resource management
and uses Domain Mediators to mediate between diﬀerent gateway interfaces.
To handle events and notiﬁcations that can be pushed by IoT applications, we
extended the resource management of IoT PaaS and added the IoT Application
Registry. The registry is a constantly evolving catalog of information about the
available and deployed applications, which guarantees that the platform always
knows what kind of application and how many of them are deployed. The neces-
sary information about the current status of an application is published by two
components: the IoT Application Market and connected gateways, respectively
the deployed application.

Implementation
The prototype of the presented approach is implemented in Java. We utilize
several open-source products from WSO21. We used the Application Server for
hosting the service-based components. To provide a ﬂexible and scalable solution
the prototype uses the ESB to connect and integrate the components. For the

IoT Application Repository we implemented a custom repository, based on the
Governance Registry and Repository. The Stakeholder Management is based on
an Identity Server that handles users and their respective roles and addition-

Collaboration management we utilized Gitorious2 and integrated the statistical
analysis tool gitinspector3. The communication of IoT Applications with IoT
PaaS is based on push notiﬁcations implemented by JMS Queues, Publishers
and Subscribers supported by Apache ActiveMQ4. As our Gateway environment
we used the Niagara Framework5. The implementation of the IoT Application
Lifecycle facilitates Niagara’s Component Lifecycle6 mechanism. Furthermore
we facilitated the Niagara Licensing7 methodology for custom applications, for
our Licensing implementation.
To demonstrate our prototype we will discuss two stakeholder perspectives
of the market. The Application Providers’ perspective is depicted in Fig. 3a and
displays the provider’s collaborations and for each collaboration the repository
provided by the market and the contributors with their respective role are shown.
Additionally the screen displays applications that got uploaded by the provider
and a form to add new oﬀerings to the market. Figure 3b depicts the customers’
perspective. The screen displays subscriptions, which the customer received for

The key concept, the overall terminology and used components of the Internet
of Things is well-deﬁned in the literature. In comparison the deﬁnition of appli-
cations in IoT is not that clear. Recent approaches [4,6] deﬁne IoT applications,
as applications that are developed on top of a resource abstraction layer. Zhu
et al. [11] deﬁne two diﬀerent types of IoT applications. An application that
is embedded in and an enterprise application that is build on the Gateway. In
contrast to the aforementioned approaches, this paper proposes lightweight IoT
applications that are directly deployed and executed on IoT devices (gateways),
which brings advantages in terms of scaling and resource consumption.
Bohli et al. [2] describes a market that oﬀers a platform to collect and trade
all kinds of sensor information in a WSN. They identiﬁed several entities that
play an important role in the market and discuss possible pricing schemes and
strategies. As the current development of IoT solutions is mostly driven by big
industrial players, [5] proposes a set of connected marketplaces where users and
developers can create and share innovative IoT artifacts. Although, they share
similarities with our approach regarding opening the IoT service delivery process
the authors solely concentrate on including users to enable innovation. Contrary
to them, our market provides an ecosystem that empowers providers to col-
laborate with various stakeholders to reduce the costs of the delivery process.
Furthermore [5] is mainly focused on providing concepts for the overall approach,
whereas we implemented a prototype to demonstrate our market’s capabilities.

Conclusion and Future Work
This paper proposes the IoT Application Market – a novel open market model
for managing the distribution of IoT applications. In the IoT Application Market
stakeholders can share, contribute and distribute their lightweight and device-
speciﬁc IoT Applications. Based on the oﬀerings users can browse the market
for interesting and suitable applications. Then they can buy, deploy and execute
them in their own local environment through self-service. To eﬃciently handle
the deployment and execution of the vast amount of applications this paper uti-
lizes the IoT PaaS framework. This domain-independent framework provides a
set of essential platform services and eases the overall management of IoT Appli-
cations. As future work we plan to extend our approach beyond the domain of
building management systems. We will also try to identify further participants
in the overall market and distribution model. Furthermore, we intend to inte-
grate pricing and revenue sharing models that allow more stakeholders that are
involved in the development process, to collaborate.

Abstract. In the envisioned Internet of Things (IoT), we expect to
see the emergence of complex service-based applications that integrate
cloud services, connected objects and a wide variety of mobile devices.
These applications will be smarter, easier to communicate with and more
valuable for enriching our environment. They interact via interfaces and
services. However, the interfaces and services can be modiﬁed due to
updates and amendments. Such modiﬁcations require adaptations in all
participating parties. Therefore, the aim of this research is to present a
vision of service co-evolution in IoT. Moreover, we propose a novel agent
architecture which supports the evolution by controlling service versions,
updating local service instances and enabling the collaboration of agents.
In this way, the service co-evolution can make systems more adaptive,
eﬃcient and reduce costs to manage maintenance.

Introduction
In this paper, we address the challenge of coordinated services in the scope of
IoT by employing an agent-based approach. Service providers may depend on
third party services to deliver quality products to customers and to other service
providers as well. To prevent outages and failures by individual service modiﬁca-
tions and updates coordinated evolution (hereafter co-evolution) is required in
such complex systems, i.e. they need a co-evolution for services in order to ensure
that no interruptions occur. A centralized solution would not be realizable due
to administrative and technical reasons. It would not be scalable, in particular,
in the area of IoT, and security issues would complicate the whole approach.
Consequently, service providers have to be responsible for the evolution of their
own services. The required actions have to be coordinated with other providers
in the IoT environment. The objective is to automate the coordinated evolution
as much as possible.
Recently, agent-based models have been suggested for IoT as they can capture
autonomy, and proactive and reactive features. Beside that, they can include
ontologies for cooperation and diﬀerent contexts [1,2]. Within the scope of IoT,

agent approaches address application levels and can use services provided by
smart objects in order to achieve co-evolution.
Service co-evolution in IoT has received barely attention so far. Thus, there
are some needs for detailing the vision of service co-evolution and solutions to
provide beneﬁts for IoT users. However, there are many challenges and require-
ments to tackle to meet an overall tradeoﬀbetween aspects like the satisfaction
of clients, the resource consumption of provided interface versions and the eﬀorts
to update them. Consequently, this paper will analyze the roles of this evolu-
tion regarding potential results, challenges and its requirements as well as the
solution.
It is not the intention of this paper to present details of Web service evolution
as that has been done elsewhere [4,5]. This paper aims at promoting the idea of
co-evolution of web services in IoT by (i) illustrating how a service co-evolution
is carried out, what should be involved, why it is essential, and what should
be prepared in order to meet the co-evolution requirements, (ii) highlighting
a novel agent architecture for service providers in the IoT environment and
explaining how this agent can be used in service co-evolution environments,
(iii) discussing some potential research challenges of service co-evolution. Thus,
the main contribution of this paper is to make software engineers aware of the
power of service co-evolution and make systems more adaptive, eﬃcient and
reliable.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 illustrates an overview
of our solution and its key components. Section 3 analyzes the coordination of
services and discusses research challenges in service co-evolution. Section 4 intro-
duces a number of existing researches and compares them with our approach, and
ﬁnally Sect. 5 draws conclusions on our current results and provides an outlook
for future work.

Solution Overview
Services running on heterogeneous systems and oﬀered by diﬀerent providers
have de-coupled lifecycles, in particular, in IoT. Single services will be updated
due to amendments or reﬁnements or to provide further functionalities. Other
providers may cut back the functionalities without taking notice of remaining
clients that try to apply the removed functions. Business processes and applica-
tions that depend on services require appropriate coordination and adaptation
by the participating parties. The solution we worked out equips every service
with an agent, called EVA (EVolution Agent), that is capable to undertake these
tasks. The internal structure and the rough composition of an EVA is depicted
in Fig. 1. The next sections introduce the main components of an EVA and their
interactions.
2.1
Analysis
The information interaction ﬂow within our model is as follows. When an EVA
receives ﬁrst an Evolution Request, it is analyzed by the Analysis module.
www.ebook3000.com

An Approach Towards a Service Co-evolution in the Internet of Things
275
Fig. 1. Architecture of the EVA: global view
An Evolution Request demands for adaptation to be able to take part in future
interactions. The Analysis module has to decide whether an evolution should
take place and, if so, whether a local evolution is possible or whether the evolu-
tion has to be coordinated with other EVAs. For this reason, it assesses ﬁrstly
the signiﬁcance of the Evolution Request by evaluating the importance, the rep-
utation and the number of partners who sent the request. The importance of a
partner will increase, the more clients are aﬀected by him. The signiﬁcance will
rise too, if the local service strongly depends on the other service and if there
are no alternative services available. If either resources are becoming scarce or if
it takes high eﬀorts to satisfy the request, then lowly rated Evolution Requests
may be rejected. Service instances not requested for a long time can be switched
oﬀto free resources for crucial service instances.
To estimate the eﬀorts required for adaptation, the Analysis module considers
initially local knowledge that includes information about locally available update
mechanisms, the diﬀerent service instances realizing diﬀerent versions of the
service, and the dependencies that the service versions might have towards other
services. In case the Analysis module accepts the Evolution Request and a local
update would satisfy the request, it will instruct the Smart Update Mechanism
module, as presented below, to execute the local update and to provide eventually

276
H.T. Tran et al.
a new service instance. If a pure local update is not available or not suﬃcient
due to an interplay between several services, the Evolution Coordination module
has to deal with a coordinated evolution and possibly ask software developers
for further conﬁgurations.
2.2
Evolution Analytics
As time passes, the Analysis and the Evolution Coordination module can take
more sophisticated decisions. The Evolution Analytics module collects runtime
data about successful and unsuccessful evolution procedures. These data include
information about local and coordinated evolutions since both modules feed
the Evolution Analytics module. The goal is to discover promising evolution
patterns by fostering successful and proven evolution procedures and prevent-
ing unsuccessful ones. Success does not only depend on smooth running in a
technical sense, but has to consider the cost-performance ratio, the revenue,
the reputation and QoS (Quality of Service) parameters too. Costs comprise,
for instance, hardware and human resources which can be estimated hardly in
the very beginning. If a new conﬁguration has been implemented, the devel-
oper speciﬁes the total man-hours spent. By means of Evolution Analytics EVA
will learn to predict worthwile evolutions while minimizing costs and time and
maximizing the own revenue and reputation. The reputation of an EVA may
decrease if it denies regularly Evolution Requests. Here, Evolution Analytics has
to weigh the reputation against other factors like the costs for updates and the
future revenue. To estimate reputation, costs and QoS, we will make use of our
two prediction algorithms presented in [7].
For reasons of bootstrapping, EVAs are allowed to share parts of their knowl-
edge with other EVAs. Special know how that aﬀects only the service supervised
by the EVA, has to be left out.
2.3
Evolution Coordination
In the event that a pure local evolution is not applicable, the Evolution Coordi-
nation module will co-operate with other EVAs and possibly interact with soft-
ware developers. For example, the service is providing a method that depends
on data delivered by a third party. To customize the interface for the client send-
ing the Evolution Request, the Evolution Coordination will determine ﬁrst the
involved third parties and send them an Evolution Request. A continuous feed-
back between the EVAs is required to keep all parties up-to-date and to recognize
future developments early. If a third party rejects the Evolution Request or if
it is not available anymore, the Evolution Coordination can start a search for
suitable services. To this end, we will adopt our service selection algorithms
proposed in [8]. If the latter fails due to a lack of matching services, the Evo-
lution Coordination will instruct the service provider or a responsible software
developer to adapt the service. For this purpose, the developer may implement
a conﬁguration that is subsequently executed by the Smart Update Mechanism.

2.4
Smart Update Mechanism
The Smart Update Mechanism encompasses mainly two types of evolution capa-
bilities. Firstly, it is aware of the diﬀerent versions of the services running as
service instances on the local machine and the versions used in the past. If
one of them is fulﬁlling the conditions required, then it will be assigned to the
requesting party. The second approach is a speciﬁcation of the evolution rules
and constraints that represent the possible service re-conﬁgurations and adapta-
tions. In MUSIC [6] application developers speciﬁed the possible variants of an
application and their dependencies on the runtime context; this was exploited
by the adaptation manager in the middleware to achieve optimized application
adaptation in diﬀerent situations.
An EVA maintains up-to-date evolution models of its services. The models
expose the possible conﬁguration and adaptation paths. The EVA may govern
multiple instances and versions of the same service at the same time, in order to
accommodate diﬀerent applications that may have diﬀerent needs with respect
to the service. Eventually, out-dated alternatives will be slowly retired.
The Analysis and Evolution Coordination modules introduced in the previous
sections decide which conﬁguration or version will be used for a speciﬁc client.
In this connection, they do not only consider the possibilities oﬀered by the
Smart Update Mechanism, but take also into account the Evolution Analytics
to optimize criteria like revenue, reputation, response time and own operability.
2.5
Repository and Middleware
The Smart Update Mechanism makes use of a repository where several conﬁg-
urations were made available by developers. Developers can add new conﬁgura-
tions to the repository during the lifetime of a service, for instance, if the Smart
Update Mechanism did not ﬁnd appropriate ones to update the service.
Since objects or mobile devices are free to enter or leave the system, the
middleware enables EVAs to communicate with each other in an asynchronous
and loosely coupled manner. Beside that, the EVA itself can be divided into its
modules such that each module may run on another device. This allows to make
use of powerful runtime environments while energy constrained IoT devices that
deliver the data oﬀered by the service are spared.

Challenges of Service Co-evolution
Service co-evolution needs to be managed in a decentralized fashion since a
centralized approach constitutes a bottleneck and would not be scalable. The
services have to be responsible for their own evolution and should coordinate
their actions with other services according to the knowledge they have of their
own capabilities and that of the other services.
Coordinating the evolution of services is a major challenge since it is a com-
plex process that requires multiple interactions, as well as continuous feedback

278
H.T. Tran et al.
to understand whether the distributed evolution is proceeding as desired. To
prevent never-ending negotiations between service providers about which ser-
vice has to adapt ﬁrst or to change at all, we introduce an algorithm that gives a
clear path for the evolution. Therefore, we include the number of clients of each
concerned service and their overall reputation.
The EVA that is managing an aﬀected service is either interested in an adap-
tation or rejects it. For this reason, an EVA can vote for (vote = +1) or against
(vote = -1) the evolution of a used service. The higher the reputation of a ser-
vice and the higher its number of clients, the higher the vote of the EVA that is
managing the service is weighted. Thus, the overall feedback is comprised of the
multiplication of the vote and the weight that consists of the reputation and the
number of clients. This means that services that satisfy and aﬀect more clients
have a higher impact. A step-wise structure of the proposed algorithm is given
in the following:
step 1: An EVA x receives an evolution request from another EVA y.
step 2: x is asking the EVAs c ∈C of its clients whether they would accept or
reject the required adaptation.
step 3: x is summing up the feedbacks of c ∈C by considering their vote and
their reputation and number of clients that are both scaled into the range [0, 1].
step 4: x is dividing the summed up feedbacks by the number of clients to obtain
fagg and compares fagg with a predeﬁned threshold value ϵ.
step 5: x is striven for the co-evolution if fagg ≥ϵ. In this case, the aforemen-
tioned steps of Sect. 2 will be executed. Otherwise, the evolution requests will be
rejected.
Mostly, evolution cannot be fully automated. In general, it is a multi-step process
that a service must go through to transition from a problematic conﬁguration,
to a more acceptable new one. This transition may involve adaptation mecha-
nisms that are already in-place, as well as oﬄine activities, such as requirements
gathering and software development. Although software evolution mechanisms
have been deeply studied in the last decades, service co-evolution oﬀers further
research challenges:
- Heterogeneous services in IoT have de-coupled lifecycles, meaning that sin-
gle services may be updated, or newly developed, while others are still in oper-
ation. Any evolution that we perform on a service requires that this action be
coordinated with other actions paramount if we want to preserve the applications
overall functionality and quality of service.
- The evolution of such complex systems will require that we harness and
understand the horizontal and vertical relationships that exist between services,
so that we can have them evolve in a coordinated fashion. This can be achieved
through modeling and analytics, and through detailed runtime analysis, e.g.,
runtime testing and formal veriﬁcation. Given the decentralized nature of the
application environment, all these tools need to rely on local knowledge of the
service itself and of its surroundings.

Joo Pimentel et al. [11] outlined the reasoning required in order to support
forward and backward co-evolution of service-oriented systems. But this paper
only analyzed how to assess the mutual impact of requirements and architecture
changes on other service oriented systems and how to react to these changes in
order to prevent misalignment between them.
The paper in [12] also provides a theoretical framework and language-
independent mechanisms for controlling the evolution of services that deal with
structural, behavioral, and QoS level-introduced service changes in a type-safe
manner. In particular, the authors distinguished between shallow changes (small-
scale, localized) and deep changes (large-scale, cascading). However, the authors
only focused to deal with shallow changes. In contrast, our paper tries to deal
with vital aspects of deep changes with an adaptive agent approach.
Authors in [10] introduced a change-oriented service life-cycle methodology
and described its phases. They discussed when a change in a service is triggered,
how to analyze its impact, and the possible implications of the implementation of
the change for the service providers and consumers. Nevertheless, a formal model
for deep changes based on the one for shallow changes is missing. Additionally,
their approach did not mention about the IoT environment which diﬀers from
our approach.
The Chain of Adapters technique [13] is an alternative approach for deploying
multiple versions of a Web service in the face of independently developed unsu-
pervised clients. The basic idea is to resolve the mismatches between the expected
by the consumers and the supported by the implementation interface [12]. It can
prove useful in self-conﬁgurations. However, it is not clear whether the approach
would scale to a high number of Web services.
In fact, there are many agent-based approaches available to support interop-
erable IoT devices and their services nowadays [1–3,9]. Nonetheless, the adap-
tation mechanisms and the collaboration characteristics in these agents are not
suﬃcient in order to achieve coordinated service evolution. Furthermore, it needs
a global vision which can predict potential eﬀects, challenges and requirements
for participating service providers.

Conclusion and Future Work
The main goal of this paper is to introduce a new vision of service co-evolution
and to provide a common evolution management model and reference architec-
ture for developers. It represents a focused eﬀort to provide a foundation for
realizing the full potential of the Internet of Services and other service-based
architectures. For this reason, the challenges in the co-evolution of services that
cover the wide spectrum from IoT to Cloud Computing, are analyzed too.
This paper also adopts a novel conceptual agent as a solution for service
co-evolution. Evolution tasks like the assessment and coordination of evolution
requests, updating and versioning the interfaces and selecting matching services

280
H.T. Tran et al.
can be performed automatically or semi-automatically by EVAs, inter alia, by
exploiting already existing self-adaptation techniques.
In future, ﬁrst research prototypes and scenarios on the coordination of EVAs
shall be delivered to evaluate the prospect of this approach. A further path
for future work is to develop an evolution description language for service co-
evolution. In this way, systems can be made more adaptive, eﬃcient and reduce
costs to manage maintenance.

Abstract. We describe a generic attribute-based identity management
system. It aims to support the large variety of security requirements
induced by applications for the IoT. Hence, we discuss various manage-
ment options for system entities. We show how attribute assurance can
be used to reliably deﬁne attributes within groups of identities. Apart
from enabling personalized identity and policy enforcement schemes, this
provides a feasible trade-oﬀbetween the ﬂexibility and scalability needs
and the policy deﬁnition and enforcement requirements in the IoT. We
provide a proof-of-concept implementation of our framework.

Introduction
There is a growing need for an Internet of Things (IoT) runtime ecosystem in
which services using actuators and data from sensors can coexist. Such an ecosys-
tem would not only expose functionalities as reusable services. It could also pro-
vide usage control; ensuring that data processing is compliant with the security
requirements of individual device owners. These inherently diverse requirements,
ask for ﬁne-grained and expressive security policy frameworks. Such security
frameworks, in turn, require a ﬂexible identity management (IDM) system for
things, services processing IoT-data, owner or users of things, and other related
entities. Thus, we propose an infrastructure to identify, authenticate, and man-
age the security principals in an IoT platform. The three main contributions of
this paper can be summarized as follows:
– Identiﬁcation of challenges faced when users deﬁne their own IDM scheme in
a platform oﬀering IoT as a service.
– Analysis of possible approaches to enable users to share identity information
with each other, while comparing the computational complexity induced in

Challenges
2.1
Support for Access and Usage Control
IoT platforms have to manage and process data of myriads of devices used for
diﬀerent applications. Controlling access to such devices using mandatory access
control (MAC) is infeasible. In contrast, discretionary access control (DAC)
needs to oﬀer the ﬂexibility required for diﬀerent application for independent
users. While role based access control (RBAC) may eﬃciently combine both
worlds, it strictly requires a uniﬁed hierarchy of roles.
Fortunately, attribute based access control (ABAC) [1–3] is able to merge
the abilities of MAC, DAC, and RBAC [4] without imperatively enforcing a
centralized role management. It enables technologies which grant access based
on attributes assigned to subjects, objects, or the environment. Flexible and
domain speciﬁc security policies can be deﬁned easily. With an IDM supporting
attributes it is also possible to implement sophisticated systems which support
ﬁne-grained policy decisions such as UCONABC model [5]. This is beneﬁcial for
the processing of security sensitive data in IoT platforms as coarse grained poli-
cies based on system principals or resource levels are insuﬃcient and inﬂexible.
Instead, attributes enable domain and application speciﬁc control mechanisms.
Policies and their enforcement can be adapted to speciﬁc needs by considering
individually deﬁned and trusted attributes.
As a consequence, the IDM presented in this contribution addresses the spe-
ciﬁc needs and security enforcement technologies feasible for IoT systems. Thus,
a reliable attribute-based principal management that enforces the correct and
authorized declaration and deﬁnition of attributes becomes inevitable.
2.2
Attribute Assurance
Once users can deﬁne their own identity schemes in the platform, they start to
resemble small identity ’silos’ with their own self-deﬁned attributes. As a result,
enabling users to interact and exchange identity information becomes critical.
To exemplify the challenges to be tackled, we consider the following scenario.
Two companies provide sensor data through an IoT platform: SensIoT, and
fakeIoT. Further, assume each company creates an attribute called “produced
by” containing the name of the company. Most likely, sensor containing the
attribute “produced by” with value SensIoT will be used more. However, unless
there is a mechanism enforcing that only devices belonging to SensIoT can
assign the value SensIoT to the attribute “produced by”, fakeIoT could start
faking attribute values to fool customers. Even though this example could be
solved by including a simple customized veriﬁcation, the question is, how to
enable companies, or groups of users, to deﬁne attributes which require approval
before those attributes are considered reliable. We call this process attribute
assurance, given its aﬃnity to a more process driven aspect of Federated Identity
Management (FIDM), called identity assurance [6,7].

2.3
Sharing Attributes with Other Users
Users should be able to decide whether they consider attribute values approved
by other users, or groups of users, to be suﬃciently reliable for supporting pol-
icy decisions. This is a parallel challenge to managing trust in FIDM [6] with
an additional pitfall: the inclusion of users’ preferences should not increase the
complexity of policy decisions. We discuss two possibilities to manage trusted
attributes and analyse their computational complexity. For this purpose, let n be
the number of attribute values for a device, service, or user that require approval
according to a policy1 and let the cost of verifying the approval status for a given
attribute be in O(1).
The ﬁrst possibility is to use a global and centralized repository of
attribute values and to authorize selected users to globally approve attributes.
In this case policy evaluation could be in O(n). Only the veriﬁcation of an
approval ﬂag would be required for each attribute value. Policy evaluation
becomes trivial as an approved attribute is automatically trusted system-wide.
However, authorized users won’t be elected freely, declining the possibility to
beneﬁt from approval mechanisms to most of the users in the IoT platform; also,
the attribute approvals become unmanageable for a limited number of authorized
users.
A completely opposite approach is to allow users to set and approve attribute
values. In such an ad-hoc sharing scheme for attributes the most important
question is whether an attribute value has been approved by a trusted user. This
notion can be implemented by adding credibility to attributes [8]. Users specify
a list of trusted users for each attribute used in a policy. Let k be the number
of users in the system. K is both, the upper bound of attribute approvals for
a given attribute value, as well as the upper bound of trusted users chosen
for each one of the n attributes. In this case, the computational complexity
of the policy evaluation is in O(n · k2). For each approval, it must be veriﬁed
whether a trusted user approved the value. Although ﬂexible, this approach
induces high computational complexity during evaluation. Hence, we propose a
trade-oﬀbetween ﬂexibility required for IoT environments and the complexity
imposed on policy evaluation.
3
Identity Management Scheme
Identities are simply a computer’s representation of an entity [9]. They are
required when their corresponding entity is either providing some functionality
or involved in some access/usage control decision. Thus, in our IoT platform, we
consider users, device representation (sensors, actuators), and services. Including
these entities beyond users allows us to control access/usage on data generated
by devices, services or the devices, and services themselves.
1 Filtering which attribute values from the user, service or device correspond to the
attributes referenced by the policy is disregarded (same algorithm for every case).

3.1
Entity Management
Users can create their own groups (e.g., organizations, family, friends). To have
signiﬁcance for security, groups must implement access control mechanisms. This
is achieved trough mutual agreement on group memberships.
A group membership is deﬁned as a tuple (u,r,g) where user u has role r
in group g. Further, before memberships are considered eﬀective by the IDM
system, it has to be approved by two parties: the administrator of g, and u. In
this way users cannot be misplaced in a group, and groups only contain approved
users. Due to this property, groups are the cornerstone for attribute assurance
and for the sharing of attribute values among users (Sects. 3.3 and 3.4).
3.2
System Structure
The IDM system contains eight modules shown in Fig. 1. Every API call to
the prototype comes from the bottom of the picture; consequently, it must go
through the authentication and authorization module before it reaches any other
module. Afterwards, if the request is related to the creation or deletion of a user,
group, or an entity, it will go directly to the appropriate registry. Note that users
are both in the user and entity registry for readability reasons, and also because
they could be handled by a third party, such as an user authentication server.
Fig. 1. Internal identity management architecture
If there is a request for the creation, deletion or approval of a user mem-
bership, it must go through the Mutual Agreement Membership Manager, which
will take care that memberships are updated only by the right users. Similarly,
if the request concerns the approval of an attribute, it will go through the Group
Based Approval Manager, which judges whether the user trying to approve an
attribute value has the right permissions in the correct group.
3.3
Attribute Deﬁnition and Assurance
Figure 2 shows how attribute deﬁnitions, attribute values, and groups are related
to each other. Attributes are deﬁned in a per-group basis. For attribute assur-
ance purposes, attribute values are only valid after they have been approved
www.ebook3000.com

IDM in Platforms oﬀering IoTaaS
285
Fig. 2. Attribute deﬁnition
by administrators of the group where the attribute deﬁnition is registered in.
Figure 2 shows two groups (SensIoT and FakeIoT) that have an attribute called
“Made in”, and also two devices with approved attribute values for the “Made
in” attribute deﬁnitions in each group. Also, both devices have values point-
ing to the same attribute deﬁnition (approved by the same authority) for the
“Location” attribute, previously deﬁned inside the weather group. This implies
an approval from an administrator of Weather group for “Himalayas” (both
devices).
3.4
Sharing Attributes with Other Users
Given the properties described in the previous section, groups are employed
as a mechanism to let users express which users (in a group) are considered
trusted. Here is the advantage in terms of policy evaluation: when users refer
to the attribute deﬁnition directly in their policies (e.g. “Made in” attribute
deﬁnition inside SensIoT), the complexity2 of the policy evaluation algorithm is
O(n) since for every attribute value, only the approval state of the attribute value
needs veriﬁcation. Most interestingly, attribute assurance is not lost since only
administrators from the group can approve the attribute value. Further, the
proposed schema is still ﬂexible enough to support an ad-hoc approval where
users provide just the name of the attribute, the expected value, and the trusted
groups for approval in their policies; nevertheless, this is not encouraged due to
computational complexity (see Sect. 2.3).
3.5
Access Control Integration
We brieﬂy illustrate the power of our IDM for policy enforcement. Assume a
variety of sensors deployed in an alpine area. They have a virtual representa-
tion in our platform and can be used by diﬀerent services. Further, suppose
independent service providers use these sensors to report on slope conditions,
generate warnings for mountaineers, or shutdown cable cars. A slope condition
service simply uses attributes to determine whether a sensor is on a speciﬁc
slope. Such attributes may change over time and confuse users but they are not

critical. However, safety relevant services need to make sure only sensors with
assured attributes, such as the height or location, are used. This particularly
holds for services casting warnings or taking actions. For this purpose, service
providers can deﬁne policies described by simple predicates validating attribute
and checking their values. In this way ABAC policies can be deﬁned also support-
ing the basic principles of UCONABC policies. Thus, instead of accumulating
the potentially changing set of IDs of entities allowed to access another entity
and assigning them some property, our IDM supports direct ﬁltering based on
attributes. This simpliﬁes the task to implement domain speciﬁc access control,
avoids administrative overhead, and prevents burdensome reimplementaitons.
As we oﬀer IoT services hosted in one platform we also support decentralized
evaluation of policies at the entity level. During entity deployment local PDPs
extract required information from the registries tagged to the respective entities.
In this way, access control decision on services, for example, boil down to simple
and localized value comparisons.

Related Work
Contributions using attributes in IDM systems are manifold and were inspired by
the ﬁrst designs of ABAC [10]. Based on these models implementations for ABAC
have been proposed. The prominent contribution by Bonatti and Samarati [11]
introduced a framework to logically specify and reason about service access and
disclosure constraints in open environments. While this contribution recognizes
the relevance of ABAC for UCON and the ﬂexibility to describe entities of
a system with attributes, it neither focuses on their management nor does it
consider their ad-hoc deﬁnitions. Similar holds for the modelling of ABAC in a
logic-based framework [1] where policies deﬁned on attributes are logic programs
with recursion allowing for powerful and eﬃcient evaluation.
Yuan and Tong apply ABAC to the web service domain [2]. An authoriza-
tion and policy deﬁnition architecture is described but it remains unclear how
attributes could be deﬁned in a ﬂexible manner. ABMAC [12], an extension of
the ABAC model, faces the same problem. Comparable to our IDM, ABMAC
also aims towards the support of multiple heterogeneous policies. Yet, it does
not consider attribute assurance as presented in this contribution.
Another popular approach is the use of attribute certiﬁciates [13–17]. They
bind entity attributes and their values to a domain. Apart from the propblem to
setup up a commonly accepted PKI, these solutions induce impractical overheads
in terms of management, during policy evaluation and challenge scalability.
In contrast, Cabarcos et al. introduce a dynamic scheme for federations
among IDM systems [18]. They deﬁne a P2P reputation system with dynamic
trust lists. If entities out of this list provide attribute values, reputation values
can be queried to decide on the reliability of the information. Reputation is
deﬁned by domain administrators. Although this system enables dynamic and
gradual trust, users cannot individually administer their policy domain.
A similar approach is taken in the Liberty framework, a federated IDM
system. It uses the Identity Web Service Framework (ID-WSF) [19] to store

principal attributes which can also be used for policy decisions. However, the
attribute declaration is strongly centralized and only security providers can
deﬁne new attributes and does not allow to select speciﬁcally trusted attributes
or authorities.
5
Conclusion
We have designed and implemented a prototype3 for a generic attribute-based
IDM for a platform oﬀering IoT as a service. In such system, every user can
deﬁne his own attribute scheme, and use mechanisms to ensure reliability of
attribute values to other users in the platform. Furthermore, users of the platform
can choose trusted groups to approve attribute values before they are used by
the PDP. Additionally, the proposed solution oﬀers a good trade-oﬀbetween
ﬂexibility and complexity increase for the policy evaluation process.

Abstract. IoT, Internet of Things, is a major revolution dragging along new
requirements that impact the network & IT infrastructure under development.
Actually, the network infrastructure is evolving to embed virtualization tech-
niques to gain in ﬂexibility. For this purpose, new architectures are drawn-up
such as the one proposed by the ETSI NFV. In this article, we ﬁrst highlight a
new business model: the IoT store. We then show how it beneﬁts from the
network & IT infrastructure services. After presenting the main actors of this
business model, we actually provide the overview of an NFV-based architecture
that fulﬁlls new IoT requirements. We thus show that the move towards a
network & IT infrastructure beneﬁting of Cloud and virtualization solutions can
highly serve the IoT deployment.

Introduction
While the availability of mature IT virtualization techniques has led the IT infra-
structure to successfully evolve to the Cloud, the network infrastructure still has to ﬁnd
its way to virtualization. This trend is on its way, in particular thanks to NFV (Network
Function Virtualization), currently under standardization by the ETSI, but also with
solutions put forward by vendors. Hence the evolution towards a new digital network
& IT infrastructure is a revolution that has begun.
IoT, Internet of Things, is another major revolution. Billions of connected objects
are upcoming, covering numerous areas ranging from health to entertainment, for
example with pointless objects [1]. As a matter of fact, IoT encompasses a large variety
of connected “things”, including IoO (Internet of Objects) and its passive objects, M2M
(Machine to Machine) and smart communicating devices / connected objects. These
billions of objects drag along new requirements impacting the network & IT infra-
structure under deﬁnition [2].
In this paper, we investigate how the network & IT infrastructure can fulﬁll some
requirements issued from IoT.
The paper is organized as follow: the IoT store’s business model is depicted in the
Sect. 2. In the Sect. 3, we present how to move forward to offer an infrastructure service
on line with IoT needs. The Sect. 4 then presents the actors and general architecture, while
the Sect. 5 presents the architecture into more details. We ﬁnally conclude in the Sect. 6.

IoT Store Business Model
The application store business model, which relies on a multitude of web designers and
developers, emerged thanks to the application of DIY (Do It Yourself) to web tech-
nologies. With the open hardware revolution, DIY now applies to the electronic ﬁeld.
By bringing a disruption into hardware conception, open hardware does not only lead
to inventiveness, it also paves the way to the creation of many connected objects
and start-ups. Hence the IoT store business model may emerge as a double-sided
business, beneﬁting on one side of the multitude of connected objects’ inventors, and
on the other side of the relationship with the customers [3, 6].
The IoT store also beneﬁts to connected objects’ inventors by offering them a
window display and by simplifying the distribution of their products. The IoT store
manager should further provide inventors with a large customer basis so that their
invention has a real opportunity to be widely exposed and adopted.
The IoT store beneﬁts to consumers, by helping them into ﬁnding a way through
the boiling universe of connected objects. In particular, connected objects shall get
through a test phase so that only the reliable ones are published on the store. Billing,
research and recommendation functions must also be implemented within the store to
allow the consumers to buy objects and to let them be guided to new experiences or
usages.
Thanks to all these elements, the IoT store business model becomes as safe as the
application store business model, and multiple actors are enticed to grasp this oppor-
tunity. Please note that the main elements of this business are depicted within white
rectangles in the following Fig. 1.

Towards Network and IT Infrastructure Services for IoT
Unlike web applications, connected objects have numerous and speciﬁc needs, while
the related standards or technical trends are not clear yet. In particular, there are many
possible access technologies, including 6LowPan, ZigBee and BLE (Bluetooth Low
Energy), and none of them clearly appears currently as the sole possible answer.
Furthermore, strong access control and authentication on the one hand and privacy and
safety on the other hand are key issues, as stated by Vint Cerf [5], that must be
addressed for the general public to gain conﬁdence in connected objects and the
associated data processing. Consider for example a connected lock letting authorized
users to get into your home even when you are away. The corresponding requirements
are very stringent and require a rigorous technical answer!
These stringent requirements will turn into the advantage of the actor that will
combine the IoT store business model with the appropriate network service in terms of
cost, QoS, connectivity and security. For instance, the IoT store itself cannot prevent
customers from pervasive monitoring of the data received and emitted by their objects.
However, that is the job of the network & IT infrastructure. The services developed over
the network & IT infrastructure may encompass for example secured network links for
exchanging information with connected objects, data storage within a cloud, gateways
to link the IoT objects to the web or the secured access to the connected objects.

The main lines of this new business model are depicted on the following Fig. 1. The
white rectangles correspond to the IoT store business model, while the grey ones are
speciﬁc to the IoT store enriched with infrastructure services. Thanks to this business
model, the store manager can win new business partners.
As depicted in the Figure, the key partners are a crowd of inventors, object
designers and start-ups. The ﬁrst need to fulﬁll is to provide a large customer basis to
the IoT inventors. This is capital but however far from enough. Actually, it is necessary
to provide inventors and consumers a common framework encompassing all the
required functions and interfaces needed over the network & IT infrastructure (e.g. IP
gateways, signaling gateways, authentication schemes, cloud resources). It is indeed
the abilities to connect objects, but also to authenticate and associate with all involved
actors the right bunch of objects, to bill, to provide secured network connections and
advanced services which are keys for the success of the IoT store.
The value propositions are ﬁrstly to ease connected objects’ distribution and ad-
vertizing for inventors and secondly to help consumers to step into the IoT through a
trusted store. The customer relationship is indeed achieved through stores, online or
not. The customer segments are very wide, as connected objects are likely to concern
all mankind, from youth to elderly, at work, at home and on leisure time. The source of
income for the IoT store actor is a percentage on all sales. Note there is also an indirect
income linked to the actor’s brand. Finally, the cost revenue must be kept very low, for
the ARPO (Average Revenue Per Object) will be very low, if not nonexistent. This can
be achieved with the dynamic sharing of network & IT resources thanks to virtual-
ization. Furthermore, for this business model to be fully effective, API (Application
Programmable Interface) must be designed and carefully opened.

If we keep in mind that there will soon be billions of connected objects offered by
multiple actors of different kind and for multiple different applications, there are a lot of
challenges ahead!
The connected lock example highlights for example the need to make the dis-
tinction between different types of actors: the owner will have the right to deliver
permanent or temporary access to a list of beneﬁciaries, a user will only have the right
to unlock the door, while the store manager may have the right to remove all rights for
unlocking the door. The related digital rights will have to be stored securely in a
referential. Yet this digital rights inventory implies referencing connected objects
thanks to metadata. This raises in particular the issue of identifying connected objects,
issue that is not solved yet to our knowledge.
Therefore one or several IoT referential will have to be created, allowing the IoT
store actor to identify, localize, characterize and group connected objects according to
different points of view and types of actors. These referentials must in particular map
objects, actors and rights related to each object. Managing and delivering access rights
to a huge range of objects of various types is challenging, and so is managing access
rights to billions of objects. The data stored in the IoT referentials also allows the
objects’ owners and users to have an overview of all the objects they are related to on a
single web page, through a single interface. By providing the objects’ location and
state, it can further be used for managing the objects’ end of life.
Another distinctive feature of connected objects is their huge diversity. They rely
on different sources of energy, including none. They are connected to different types of
access networks, including very low range connections. Some of them are connected
by intermittence, either to preserve their battery or because they are intended to connect
to an intermediate device that will provide them with the access to the service. This is
for example the case of a NFC tag exchanging information with a smartphone. Hence a
lot of basic connected objects will need to rely on a gateway to send and receive data.

Actors and General Architecture
As we have seen in the previous section, each connected object may be linked to
different actors, including in particular its owner, its user and its manager. Each of these
actors is interested by different kinds of information on the object. Consider for
example an anemometer placed close to a kite surf spot and fed by a windmill. This
anemometer thus provides wind information when the windmill can provide enough
energy. Yet, when an anemometer does not provide any information, the owner may be
interested by knowing whether it is because there is no wind or because the ane-
mometer has broken down, while the users are only concerned by having access to the
wind information. Furthermore, providing an overview of all available anemometers on
a given geographical area and keeping an up-to-date inventory of them is an issue to
address. More generally, managing any ﬂeet of objects and providing its owner with
exploitation information is a service that should be widely developed. For performing
this, the store manager needs to build an IoT referential, including all metadata related
to the object and in particular: an identiﬁcation of each object, of each actor linked to
the object and all access rights to each of these objects.
292

www.ebook3000.com

The main actors are depicted in the following ﬁgure. They include on the one side
the object user that actually uses the object and the object owner that buys and
maintains the object, both depicted on the left-hand lower corner of the ﬁgure. On the
other side, the inventor speciﬁes, designs and possibly markets connected objects. As
an intermediate between these two actors lies the store manager, responsible for
delivering, advertising and marketing applications and services related to IoT. To
achieve these actions, the store manager relies on a convergent and virtualized network
& IT infrastructure. IoTaaS services are provided on top of this virtualized infra-
structure, providing on the ﬂy resources such as applicative gateways and including
also an IoT referential, matching objects, actors and access rights (Fig. 2).
Thanks to this infrastructure, the store manager can identify and authenticate
objects and objects’ users and owners. Correlating this authentication to the IoT ref-
erential is indeed crucial for respecting strong access control and authentication, pri-
vacy and safety, required for the general public to gain conﬁdence in connected objects.
Furthermore, the store manager must provide interfaces to the inventors on the one side
and to the objects’ users and owners on the other side for them to manage the pool of
connected objects they are related to, as we are going to depict into more details in the
following Sect. 5.

Overview of the Network and IT Infrastructure
Architecture
In this section, we give an overview of the network & IT architecture for addressing
IoT requirements. More precisely, we show how the ETSI NFV architecture framework
[4] can be used to support the IoT store.
Having access to a gateway between IoT on one side and service platforms on the
other side is a recurrent issue. We have seen we will soon be surrounded by billions of
connected objects. We therefore need to build these gateways on a scalable framework,
in which one will pay only for what he actually uses. These are part of the founding
principles of Cloud services, and hence we believe the answer shall be found in
virtualization and Cloud directions. Currently, Cloud services are mature for the IT
infrastructure, but not yet for network resources. With NFV, the ETSI currently deﬁnes
the virtualization applied to network functions. As a matter of fact, some network
functions have speciﬁc requirements concerning the type of hardware they can be
deployed on or else their geographical localization. Pure IT Cloud infrastructures not
being able to fulﬁll these requirements, NFV speciﬁes a general framework to over-
come these issues. In particular, the following Fig. 3 depicts 3 new functions speciﬁed
by the ETSI: the NFV orchestrator, the VNF (Virtual Network Function) manager and
the VIM (Virtual Infrastructure Manager).
The VIM is responsible for controlling and managing the virtual machines pro-
viding computing, storage and network resources.
Then, a VNF (Virtual Network Function) is used to support a network function, for
example in our case an IoT gateway. The VNF manager is responsible for controlling
and managing all VNFs. For example, if thousands of connected objects wake up at the
same time to upload the information they have collected, the correspond IoT gateway’s
VNF may need to scale up. This is achieved by the VNF manager that asks the VIM to
allocate a new virtual machine to the VNF in order to put up with the new trafﬁc load.
When uploading its collected data, the IoT gateway needs to get in touch with
another network function: the data collection. But this data collection also relies on a
VNF, made of one or several virtual machines. Hence directing the collected data to the
correct location is not straightforward, and needs the speciﬁcation of a network service:
the IoT data collection in our case. This network service is controlled and managed by
the NFV orchestrator. In particular, the orchestrator has a complete knowledge of all
deployed IoT gateways and data collectors together with the links between them. It can
further create a new gateway when necessary, for example for scalability of localization
issues.
Unlike IT resources, the geographical location of network functions is indeed
crucial. In particular, the IoT gateway cannot be deployed anywhere in the network, but
only in precise and deﬁned locations. The ETSI NFV addresses this issue by allowing
speciﬁc constraints to be added when requiring a virtual machine, including hardware
and localization constraints. Thus NFV can bring an appropriate answer for deploying
IoT gateways geographically distributed throughout a territory.
The following Fig. 3 depicts other elements, and in particular a portal to which the
objects’ owners and users are related. This IoT portal offers several services, within
294

which the IoT dashboard. To build this dashboard, the IoT portal requires the access to
the IoT referential. For security and safety issues, this access to the IoT referential must
be protected thanks to an identiﬁcation and authentication function. We thus highlight
new interfaces, A and B, depicted in red in the Fig. 3.
The above Figure highlights another new interface, labeled C, between the IoT
portal and another function named “deploy & provision services”. This function is
responsible for interacting with the NFV orchestrator to create new network services or
update existing network services for instance in terms of features, topologies, resources.
This new interface is restricted to the store manager and does thus not need other actors
to authenticate.
The IoT referential is also implemented within a VNF, using one or several virtual
machines. We have seen this referential must have knowledge concerning all objects,
including the identiﬁcation, the type of connected object and type of object’s
authentication. The object’s location, crucial when deploying IoT gateways, shall be
referenced within this IoT referential function. The list of each object’s users and owner
shall also be stored within the referential. This list must be dynamically updated each
time a digital right is either created or removed by the object’s owner. This referential
shall further be improved by the network & IT infrastructure, which provides in par-
ticular location and status information.
Smartphones as widely distributed and smart connected devices are likely to play a
particular role, acting as gateways and digital rights repository. The IoT referential can
be linked to a push notiﬁcation server and provide relevant information concerning a

collection of connected objects to the smartphone, including for example the owners’
identity and the status of the object (alive, unreachable, low battery…).
More generally, IoT requirements can be fulﬁlled by dynamically implementing
new functions thanks to the NFV framework. This framework indeed offers the key
advantage of scalability and cost-efﬁciency that are vital to address the tsunami of
connected objects and their very low ARPO.

Conclusion
Modeled on the application store business model, the IoT store is emerging as a
double-sided business between the IoT inventors and consumers. The open hardware
revolution actually paves the way to the multiplication of IoT inventors. However,
connected objects have numerous and speciﬁc needs, while the related standards or
technical trends are not clear yet. We have thus highlighted an evolution of the store
business model, in which the double-sided IoT store business is enriched with network
& IT infrastructure services. In particular, we have shown that new functions are
required and must be combined: IoT gateways and IoT referential. Because these new
functions must be highly scalable and cost-efﬁcient, we suggest relying on the virtu-
alization techniques – see ETSI NFV framework - for their deployment. We have thus
provided an overview of this new network & IT infrastructure service architecture. We
indeed believe that the IoT stringent requirements will turn into the advantage of the
IoT store actor that will be able to offer the appropriate network & IT services in terms
of cost, QoS, connectivity, ﬂexibility and security.

Abstract. In order to achieve the capacity and geographic scope
required by IoT applications, service providers should explore mutually-
beneﬁcial modes of collaboration such as through cooperative packet
forwarding by IoT nodes and cooperative gatewaying through ﬁxed
backhauls. To promote such resource pooling while minimizing nega-
tive impact on collaborating providers, we developed a transport-layer
approach that combines multipath techniques with less-than-best eﬀort
(LBE) congestion control methods to enable IoT nodes to opportunisti-
cally scavenge for idle bandwidth across multiple paths. Initial tests using
TCP-LP and LEDBAT congestion control algorithms on scavenging sec-
ondary ﬂows show that this desired functionality can be achieved, while
our use of standard TCP congestion control on primary ﬂows ensures
that IoT nodes are guaranteed at least one ﬂow that can compete for
fair share of the network capacity.

Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) will place new demands on service providers for
connectivity, including ﬁxed infrastructure-based gateway services and backhaul
to cloud services for further aggregation, processing, storage and distribution of
data from devices and smart objects. Prudent design would dictate that such
gateways and backhauls be engineered to appropriately handle peak aggregate
traﬃc from potentially large numbers of data sources. In addition, suﬃcient
coverage over large geographic areas would ensure continuous connectivity even
in the face of mobility. Moreover, the strategic placement of access points and
gateways would help minimize energy-consuming packet forwarding within the
wireless network of objects.
All these technical requirements will result in design challenges and signiﬁcant
capital and operating costs to IoT service providers in the future. In order to
avoid having to engineer for peak loads and maximum coverage, one possible

approach for IoT providers servicing overlapping areas would be to enter into
mutually-beneﬁcial bilateral commercial agreements enabling cooperative access
and transit through their peers nodes and infrastructure. Such cooperation may
further be enhanced if nodes are available to concurrently exploit the multiple
forwarding paths through the additional resources made available by cooperating
providers.
1.1
Multipath Bandwidth Scavenging
Although current routing techniques allow packets from a single origin to be
forwarded via multiple routes and gateways, naively striping packets from a sin-
gle ﬂow into multiple paths may cause problems for transport layer protocols
with reliable in-order delivery and congestion control functionality. Uneven path
delays and loss characteristics may trigger timeouts and unnecessary retransmis-
sions, requiring endpoints to heavily buﬀer out-of-order received packets [4,5,16].
A better alternative would be to intelligently partition application ﬂows into sub-
ﬂows and enforce per-subﬂow reliability and congestion control mechanisms. This
has been the general approach taken by the Internet community with Multipath
TCP (MPTCP), which, along with coordinated congestion control between sub-
ﬂows, will provide TCP the capability to utilize multiple paths between source
and destination for redundancy and better resource usage [15].
MPTCP can potentially provide the multipath capability we require. How-
ever, it is possible that a provider will not wish to fairly share bandwidth with a
competitor that opportunistically uses bandwidth on top of what it can already
obtain from its own network. In other words, an IoT service provider might
only allow a competitor to scavenge whatever remaining unused bandwidth is
available.
1.2
Less-Than-Best Eﬀort Congestion Control
as a Scavenging Mechanism
If opportunistic scavenging subﬂows are too aggressive, these may negatively
impact the ability of other nodes to use the network and thus defeat the pur-
pose of allowing scavenging in the ﬁrst place. Indeed, a paramount concern in
scavenging scenarios is to minimize impact on entities volunteering the use of
their idle resources [13]. This may be achieved through the use of a class of con-
gestion control mechanisms called less-than-best-eﬀort (LBE) mechanisms, that
detect the onset of congestion more quickly than conventional packet loss-based
ones [14]. A desirable side eﬀect is that when LBE ﬂows mix with TCP ﬂows in
a bottleneck link, the former yield bandwidth to the latter. In the absence of any
competing ﬂows, an LBE ﬂow will also attempt to maximize the use of the avail-
able bandwidth. These characteristics make LBE congestion control techniques
well suited to the task of opportunistic bandwidth scavenging.
Inspired by current work on LBE congestion control and MPTCP, we devel-
oped a hybrid transport-layer approach that would enable concurrent multipath
bandwidth scavenging by combining MPTCPs multipath mechanisms with LBE

congestion control. Our design and validation eﬀorts are described in the rest of
this paper.
2
MP-LBE Design
Similar to MPTCP, two communicating endpoints start by establishing a single
primary subﬂow that uses standard TCP-like congestion control. Any additional
paths that are discovered will carry secondary subﬂows, and use LBE congestion
control mechanisms. These secondary subﬂows are essentially the ones that scav-
enge bandwidth from the rest of the network, opportunistically using resources
from both its own and from cooperating providers.
2.1
Congestion Control in Secondary Subﬂows
Our work aims to explore the use of the LBE class of congestion control methods
in secondary subﬂows in order to achieve low-impact multipath bandwidth scav-
enging. We start by evaluating TCP-LP and LEDBAT as candidate congestion
control methods in our secondary subﬂows.
TCP-LP is a congestion control algorithm that manages the congestion win-
dow of the sender based on the delay experienced by the traﬃc on a bottle-
neck [9]. TCP-LP uses variations in one-way delay to infer congestion earlier
than standard TCP through a simple threshold-based algorithm. TCP-LP cal-
culates one-way delay (owd) upon receiving an ACK by computing the diﬀerence
between the receiver’s timestamp in the ACK and the timestamp taken when
the sender sent the packet, which the receiver copies into the ACK and echoes
back to the sender. A smoothing parameter γ is used to get a weighted average
of the current owd measurement with the previous owd measurement. When the
smoothed owd rises above a fraction δ of the diﬀerence between the maximum
owd (dmax) and minimum owd (dmin), congestion is inferred. TCP-LP will then
reduce the congestion window by half and enter an inference phase where it
awaits further congestion indication. If congestion is detected during the infer-
ence phase, cwnd is reduced to 1. Otherwise, TCP-LP proceeds with an additive
increase of cwnd.
LEDBAT, like TCP-LP, measures owd using the timestamps in the ACKs
received at the sender side [12]. In place of TCP-LPs threshold-based algorithm
for inferring congestion, LEDBAT makes use of a target queuing delay value.
When queuing delay becomes higher than the target, congestion is assumed and
LEDBAT reduces its cwnd to alleviate the potential congestion in the network.
LEDBAT regulates the cwnd size using a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)
controller, which varies the cwnd proportional to the diﬀerence of the queueing
delay and the target value.
2.2
Congestion Control in Primary Subﬂows
Our primary subﬂows use TCP SACK, which is a loss-based congestion control
algorithm. As such, it does not detect congestion as early as the delay-based
algorithms of TCP-LP and LEDBAT.

Evaluation
We used an existing NS-2 MPTCP implementation [11] and disabled conges-
tion control coupling between subﬂows. We further modiﬁed it by assigning its
ﬁrst subﬂow to use standard TCP, and any succeeding subﬂow added to the
connection takes on an LBE congestion control algorithm. We implemented two
versions of MP-LBE: one that uses LEDBAT for its secondary ﬂow and one that
uses TCP-LP. Our LEDBAT implementation uses a target queueing delay value
of 12 ms. We used γ=1/8 and δ=0.25 for the TCP-LP implementation.
The topology used in all the simulations is shown in Fig. 1. An MP-LBE con-
nection is conﬁgured with two subﬂows, one primary and one secondary subﬂow,
and each of these share a bottleneck link with a TCP connection. The bottle-
neck links each have a capacity of 5 Mbps and 5 ms delay. The link used by the
primary subﬂow will be referred to as the top link, while the link used by the
secondary subﬂow will be referred to as the bottom link.
Fig. 1. The topology used for the simulations. Each access link is conﬁgured with a
capacity of 100 Mbps, with 5 ms delay.
3.1
Bandwidth Scavenging
In this simulation, both subﬂows compete with standard TCP traﬃc. MP-LBE’s
primary subﬂow should share its evenly link with the competing traﬃc, while
the secondary subﬂow should back oﬀ. Halfway into the simulation, the TCP
connection on the bottom link ends, and the secondary subﬂow should react by
maximizing the available bandwidth once the link becomes idle. Both MP-LBE
(LEDBAT) and MP-LBE (TCP-LP) are able to achieve this behavior, as seen
in Fig. 2. When the secondary ﬂow is using LEDBAT,it is able to maximize the
available bandwidth better than TCP-LP. We observed that LEDBAT achieves
a steadier throughput because its cwnd size does not change as drastically as
that of TCP-LP.

3.2
LBE Behavior
In this experiment, we disabled the competing TCP connection on the bottom
link at the start of the simulation. This allowed the secondary ﬂow to maximize
5 Mbps capacity of the link. At 45 s, a TCP connection begins on the bottom
link, which should cause the secondary subﬂow to back oﬀ. Figure 3 shows the
simulation results. MP-LBE using TCP-LP on its secondary subﬂow was able
to back oﬀmore rapidly than LEDBAT, but both demonstrated correct LBE
behavior when the bottom link stopped being idle.
3.3
Goodput
In multipath connections, even if the aggregation of bandwidth eﬀectively
improves throughput, the goodput achieved is usually not as high due to the
out-of-order arrival of packets. To evaluate the MP-LBEs goodput performance,
we recorded the data-level sequence numbers (DSNs) received by the destination
node and plotted this against time. For this experiment, we eliminated all com-
peting TCP traﬃc. We ran the simulation using regular MPTCP, in addition to

the simulation runs for MP-LBE (LEDBAT) and MP-LBE (TCP-LP). The sim-
ulation results (Fig. 4) show that the rate of DSN increase of both MPTCP and
MP-LBE (LEDBAT) is the same, while MP-LBE (TCP-LP) achieves much lower
DSN within the given time. For the ﬁrst 4 s of the experiment (Fig. 4(b)), the
MP-LBEs primary subﬂow (for both LEDBAT and TCP-LP) received DSNs at
a slower rate than the secondary subﬂow, causing the goodput to suﬀer because
only the DSNs on the secondary subﬂow are arriving, and all the DSNs sent
through the primary subﬂow are delayed in arriving. In the case of MP-LBE
(LEDBAT), when the delayed packets ﬁnally arrive a little after 3 s, the primary
subﬂow has picked up its pace. After this point, the rate of DSN increase of
MP-LBE (LEDBAT) matches that of MPTCP.

Related Work
Resource scavenging is not a new concept, having been previously used to har-
ness idle computing resources to perform useful calculations for users other than
the resource owner [13]. Our approach focuses on network bandwidth scaveng-
ing through a transport layer multipath approach. While there has been some
recent similar work on the development of a multipath version of LEDBAT
called LEDBAT-MP [1], we are interested in the more general class of LBEs and
intend to comparatively evaluate several of the representative algorithms for
our intended application. Furthermore, our approach makes a crucial distinction
between primary and secondary ﬂows, ensuring that nodes can rely on at least
one ﬂow, the primary one, to compete fairly within the network.
In order to achieve cooperative gatewaying among providers, we need mecha-
nisms to enable concurrent access to their respective ﬁxed wireless infrastructure.

BeWiﬁ[2], a service rolled out by service provider Telefonica, allows users to use
idle capacity through neighbors access points within range, while CableWiFi [3]
employs a multi-provider model, allowing customers from ﬁve ISPs access to the
consortiums infrastructure. One mechanism that can enable cooperative gate-
waying is oﬀered by BaPu (Bunching of Access Point Uplinks) [8], which employs
packet overhearing to pool together WiFi uplinks that are in close proximity to
one another. BaPu was designed primarily for uploading user-generated content
over the Internet and cannot be used for downloads.
The ability to concurrently exploit multiple paths for bandwidth scavenging
may also be viewed as a problem of bandwidth aggregation. Application layer
solutions such as DBAS [7] typically do not require changes in the underlying pro-
tocols or infrastructure, but instead rely on an application-layer proxy residing
within the endpoint to intercept traﬃc, and manage the scheduling, reordering,
and transmission of that traﬃc over multiple network interfaces. We preferred to
take an endpoint-based approach since it oﬀers an end-to-end solution, covering
both the ﬁxed and wireless portions of the network.

Conclusion and Future Work
We proposed an approach for multipath bandwidth scavenging in the Inter-
net of Things through the introduction of a transport-layer protocol that uses
TCP-like congestion control for primary subﬂows and LBE congestion control
for secondary subﬂows. Our simulations demonstrate that our MP-LBE design
can eﬀectively improve throughput when an idle link becomes available for a
secondary subﬂow to utilize. Such an ability to scavenge additional bandwidth
and paths may oﬀer the ability for sensors and devices to transmit information
at higher-than-minimum levels of spatial and temporal resolution, or to explore
shortcut fast paths to accelerate local aggregation and processing of data by
peer devices within the IoT. When no additional links are available, the primary
subﬂow is able to maintain the throughput of a standard single-ﬂow TCP, and
secondary ﬂows are able to rapidly utilize the links once they become idle.
Smart objects and devices in the Internet of Things will undoubtedly have
to dedicate most of their resources to their primary tasks of sensing and aggre-
gating data, and to execute any local processing and cognitive functionality
required. It is a challenge therefore to minimize the resource footprint of any
new functionality being introduced, including multipath bandwidth scavenging.
The management of concurrent multipath TCP ﬂows is known to introduce addi-
tional buﬀering resource requirements in endpoints [6], with approaches ranging
from smart packet transmission scheduling [4,5] and network coding [10] having
been proposed as mitigating solutions. We intend to investigate these approaches
further, with the view of achieving low-overhead implementations.

Abstract. Building the Environment for Things as a Service (BETaaS) is a
novel platform for the deployment and execution of content-centric M2M
applications, which relies on a local cloud of gateways. BETaaS platform
provides a uniform interface and services to map content with things in a
context-aware manner. Deployment of services for the execution of applications
is dynamic and takes into account the computational resources of the low-end
physical devices used. To this aim, BETaaS platform is based on a suitable
deﬁned IoT model, allowing the integration of the BETaaS components within
the future Internet environment. In this paper we present the BETaaS concept,
the high level platform architecture and application scenarios that extend the
state-of-the-art in M2M communications and open the horizon for future M2M
marketplaces.

Introduction
Marketplaces of applications became a trend over the past years within this decade and
this trend is a game-changer by providing a different business model. Usually the app
marketplaces are linked with smart phones, but are not limited to that. Recently
operating systems make use of such models and even TV manufactures is using this
‘channel’ to differentiate from the competitors in the smart TVs world. M2M com-
munications, which imply the elimination of the human in the loop, are not only a

trend, but is the natural evolution of the marketplaces. The IoT that integrate objects
into the Internet, has opened new horizons in the M2M communications and we
consider this as a unique opportunity to come up with a Things as a Service Envi-
ronment that will increase the spectrum of M2M applications.
This paper is organized around 5 sections. After the ﬁrst section, which is this
introduction, we present in Sect. 2 the current approaches, the limitations and the
constraints of M2M applications and IoT. The section ﬁnishes with the challenges that
are addressed from BETaaS platform, that are described in more detail under Sect. 3,
BETaaS platform. In this section the concept, the high level architecture and the Things
as a Service model are described, which are the basis of the BETaaS project and the
major innovation of this approach. In Sect. 4 we focus on M2M applications that can be
available in future marketplaces, requiring the ﬂexibility offered by BETaaS approach.
Finally, in the conclusions section we focus on the next step and the vision of BETaaS
in the IoT and M2M world.

M2M Applications and IoT
2.1
Current Approaches, Limitations and Ways to Address
These Challenges
The main limitations coming from the world of M2M applications and IoT is certainly
related to fragmentation of standards and technologies. A lot of them are available on
the market and platforms are often designed to work with speciﬁc subsets, depending
on the applications. BETaaS architecture includes a speciﬁc layer in charge of adapting
to speciﬁc technologies and protocols. Furthermore the platform is based on a software
framework that allows plug-ins to be dynamically added, making it easy to cope with
the fragmentation of the M2M market referred above. Besides that, BETaaS focuses
on the ETSI M2M standard that is going to be a promising solution to next M2M
systems. The platform then opens to this class of sensor networks that is likely to soon
become the most widespread M2M standard, partially representing a solution to
fragmentation. Another class of limitations is related to the heterogeneity of ontologies
that have to be harmonized and integrated when several applications and devices need
to talk each other. BETaaS faces this issue through the construction of an ontologies
network. Concerning the implementation patterns of M2M systems, a strong limitation
often comes from their vertical and closed architecture. It commonly happens that each
infrastructure serves a single M2M application, excluding any interoperability pattern
between other systems, applications or things. Thus, when new M2M applications are
needed, providers have to re-create M2M communication platforms and data repre-
sentation formats. BETaaS differentiates itself from this kind of model, implementing a
horizontal approach and deﬁning a single common reference model that can be used by
different applications and devices to build M2M services.

2.2
Challenges
BETaaS is providing a new vision about the way to expose and manage things in the
Internet of Everything environment. The BETaaS platform is using semantic tech-
nologies and stays close to the M2M nodes, through the creation of local clouds among
nodes in concrete contexts. That ease the development and execution of content centric
user applications, thus allowing the deﬁnition of new M2M applications whose scope
spans across different domains. Evaluating the advances of BETaaS compared to
existing approaches, there are signiﬁcant improvement in aspects like QoS, interop-
erability aspects, discovery, security and trust, and the integration of Big Data analytics
capabilities. At QoS level, the BETaaS improvements include QoS negotiation support,
support to real-time applications, energy-efﬁcient selection of things and QoS assur-
ances in a distributed environment. BETaaS deﬁnes a comprehensive QoS management
framework that comprises a general QoS model in order to differentiate IoT/M2M
services based on appropriate QoS measures, and optimized resource reservation and
allocation to services. BETaaS extends the current state-of-art of SLA creation and
negotiation for enabling the BETaaS QoS model in the relevant M2M application
scenarios. Regarding interoperability, BETaaS integrates different IoT/M2M systems
and exploits different capabilities of different IoT/M2M systems. As far as discovery is
concerned, BETaaS supports distributed discovery of thing services and look-up of
thing services based on context and with regards to security and trust, BETaaS focuses
on the secure access to thing services and trust establishment in the overall system.
BETaaS also enables virtualization in ARM-based devices, so it is possible to perform
more complex tasks in the local environment. In addition, BETaaS leverages innova-
tive Big Data capabilities to build a highly scalable and efﬁcient architecture that is
capable of handling the large amount of highly distributed information generated by
things, and then enabling to query data with low complexity.

BETaaS Platform
3.1
BETaaS Approach
BETaaS platform provides a runtime environment relying on a local cloud of gateways
to support the deployment and execution of content-centric M2M applications. BETaaS
platform seamlessly integrates existing heterogeneous M2M systems by means of a
network of gateways. Each gateway runs the BETaaS run-time environment that forms
a logical overlay. The logical federation of networks forms a local cloud in which each
gateway shares the functionalities offered by the smart objects of its M2M systems with
the rest of the network. The run-time platform running on each gateway provides M2M
applications connected to any of the BETaaS gateways a common interface to access
their respective things, regardless of location and technology. In order to account for
heterogeneity, the BETaaS platform builds upon a baseline reference model and
architecture, Things-as-a-Service (TaaS), providing an abstract and uniform description
of the underlying M2M systems. The TaaS paradigm deﬁnes for each thing connected
to the platform, a thing service is created to represent the basic service(s) that can be
provided to each application. The BETaaS platform is content-centric in the sense that
BETaaS Platform – A Things as a Service Environment
307

it provides services that depend on the type of data that they provide and on the context
in which that data is used. The circumstances that have not been considered in BETaaS
as part of the context of a thing are its battery level, its available computing capacity,
the communication protocol used and its location. BETaaS uses semantic technologies
and natural language processing to unify the information that comes from heteroge-
neous things and to deal with the dynamic nature of their context. Following this
purpose, we have built the BETaaS ontology, a network of ontologies created reus-
ing ontologies that are relevant in their domains and that model the BETaaS scenarios.
In particular, we have used the following ontologies: SSN [1], Time [2], CF [3],
Phenonet [4], MUO [5], FIPA [6] and GeoNames [7]. To promote standardization, the
contextual information related to things (type of thing, location, etc.) is translated to
WordNet [8] synsets whenever possible, and stored in the ontology. Wordnet is a
lexical database that groups English words into sets of synonyms (synsets), and whose
organization is based on the semantic relationships between synsets (hypernymy,
hyponymy, holonymy and meronymy). All synsets inserted in the BETaaS ontology
are stored following these relationships, through SKOS, [9] which offers a common
data model to organize classiﬁcations in a hierarchical way. The relationships between
the terms are used as a mechanism of knowledge inference. Inference can be applied at
the time of the execution of applications: e.g. if an application demands the temperature
at home, a temperature sensor installed in the kitchen is valid (kitchen is meronym of
home). Inference can also be applied when registering things in the BETaaS ontology:
e.g. a new thing described as moistness sensor, would be added to a family in the
ontology described as humidity sensors (moistness and humidity belong to the
same WordNet family). The contextual information associated to each of the things
connected to a gateway allows the platform to create a thing service for each
of those things, following the nomenclature setLocationType/getLocationType (e.g.
getKitchenTemperature).
3.2
BETaaS High Level Architecture
BETaaS high level architecture is depicted in Fig. 1. A layered structure is adopted to
guarantee at the top the proper level of abstraction to applications and at the bottom the
ﬂexibility
necessary
to
integrate
different
system

technologies.
The core component of the BETaaS architecture is the Thing as a Service layer (TaaS)
that is implemented in a distributed fashion this layer exposes a service oriented interface
to access the things connected to the platform, regardless of their technology and physical
location. Build on top of the TaaS layer BETaaS platform exposes the service layer to
applications. A basic service that exposes directly one or more thing services, or can be an
extended service installed on the platform to provide to custom services.
Transparent integration of existing systems is achieved through the deﬁnition of
adaptation layers. An adaptation layer implements a common interface towards TaaS
layer to access the functionalities of the physical system in a uniform manner regardless
of its technology. The deﬁnition of an adaptation layer allows the integration without
requiring any modiﬁcations to the original system which is BETaaS-unaware, though at
308
S. Kyriazakos et al.
www.ebook3000.com

the cost of possible replication of some functionalities. When modiﬁcations to the
original systems are allowed, a more efﬁcient integration can be achieved introducing a
set of modiﬁcations which make the original system BETaaS-aware, through the
implementation of some of the BETaaS layers. Some or all of the BETaaS function-
alities are implemented by the integrated system in a fully interoperable manner, i.e.
compliant with BETaaS internal interfaces.
3.3
Things as a Service
The major impediment of the current IoT galaxy is its fragmentation. Current IoT is
made of vertical isolated systems characterized by different technologies and com-
munication protocols, often proprietary and not interoperable. In this context the
BETaaS goal is to build the environment for the integration of these systems into a
horizontal architecture on which the next generation of applications will leaverage. At
this aim, one of most important feature of the platform is providing a uniﬁed interface
to applications in order to enable seamless access to smart objects abstracting their
technology and location. At this aim, the BETaaS platform deﬁnes at its core a Service
Oriented interface, the Things as a Service model, TaaS for short. Goal of the TaaS is to
abstract all the details behind each thing, e.g. location, technology, communication
protocol, through a common representation, the Thing Service. Deﬁned in [11], the
Thing Service is the logical representation of a basic functionality that can be offered
by a physical smart object. The role of the TaaS model within the BETaaS platform is
illustrated in Fig. 2. As can be seen the TaaS model is implemented in the platform by
Fig. 1. BETaaS architecture.
BETaaS Platform – A Things as a Service Environment
309

the TaaS layer, which is at the core of the BETaaS architecture, between the lower
layers (Adaptation and Physical layers) and the higher layers (Service layer and
applications). TaaS main responsibility is to implement the bridge between the “service
providers” (things) and the “service consumers” (services and applications). Smart
devices from different physical IoT systems are integrated within the platform through
the Adaptation layer: for each IoT system a different Adaptation instance is installed to
implement a common interface that is used by the TaaS to discover and access things.
For each device, one or more Thing Services are created to be exposed to Service
Layer. TaaS layer represents also the foundation for the BETaaS distributed architec-
ture. Implemented in a distributed manner over the local cloud of gateways that
characterizes BETaaS deployments, the TaaS allows services, and indirectly applica-
tions, to access the Thing Services not only regardless of their speciﬁc interface or
communication protocol, but also independently of their physical location. Retrival and
exploitation of context information is of paramount importance for TaaS operations.
Semantic capabilities, in particular, are included in the TaaS implementation to process
the context associated with each thing to derive the set of Thing Services. At this aim
the TaaS Context information are also exploited to provide Look-up functionalities to
services which can request a Thing Service through its contextual requirements. In
order to support deployment of real-time applications the TaaS layer includes Quality
of Service (QoS) funcitonalities that can be used by the Service Layer to request a
certain QoS for invoking a Thing Service. In order to support heterogeneous
requirements that characterize IoT deployments, the QoS is negotiated to stipulate a
SLA. For this reason, a negotiation procedure is implemented in the TaaS to allow
services to negotiated the QoS level necessary to fulﬁll application needs. QoS is
enforced through an efﬁcient managing of resources, which is performed exploiting the
Fig. 2. Thing as a service model.

concept of Equivalent Thing Services, Thing Services that can provide the same
functionality equivalently.
4
Application scenarios
4.1
Smart City
The Smart City scenario is mainly focused on the integration of Smart Things
belonging to different systems. This scenario shows how BETaaS can adapt to different
data sources, how it can be used to build a complete system and how it can provide an
added value to existing ones.
4.2
Building Blocks
The scenario is built upon:
• A smart lighting system that controls public lamp posts in a parking lot
• A system to manage cars access to a restricted area of the city based on the car’s
positions
• A trafﬁc system that receives data from trafﬁc sensors installed along a network of
roads.
The smart lighting system is completely implemented through a single BETaaS gate-
way connected to ETSI-enabled devices: light intensity tunable lamp posts and infrared
presence sensors. A second BETaaS gateway is in charge of receiving users’ position,
matching them to the city map. It is intended to implement a service to check the access
to Low Emission Zones (LEZ), making users to pay a fee as they enter. In this case
Things are represented by on-board cars’ GPS receivers. The trafﬁc system is then a
completely independent system called SIMIS (Sustainable and Intelligent Mobility
Integrated System). It allows to check the current status of roads and parking lots, also
providing trafﬁc data to external applications. In this scenario it is shown how BETaaS
can be easily extended to receive data from it.
4.3
Integration through BETaaS
In this smart city scenario the two BETaaS gateways described above are then used to
make up a single BETaaS instance. Once they are conﬁgured to join each other, they
start sharing their resources. Gateways resources are mainly represented by the Thing
Services they created on top of the Things: lamp posts, presence sensors, trafﬁc sensors
and cars’ GPS receivers. BETaaS allows to add an application logic inside the instance
through extended services. In this scenario two extended services are included:
• The smart lighting extended service on the ﬁrst gateway. It not only exploits the
presence sensors directly connected to the gateway itself but it also considers the
trafﬁc data provided by the other gateway. Lamp light is then intensiﬁed or dimmed
also based on the current trafﬁc density.
BETaaS Platform – A Things as a Service Environment
311

• The LEZ extended service not only uses the cars’ position to make users pay a fee
once they enter the restricted zone. It also exploits trafﬁc data coming from SIMIS
to compute dynamic fees based on the current roads congestion.
Extended services may also be accessed by BETaaS users from their external appli-
cations. So in this case users access the platform through mobile applications from their
cars, being notiﬁed about the current fee that is currently applied, depending on their
position and trafﬁc intensity.
4.4
Home domain
The Home Domain scenario is focusing on a typical need of Smart Homes and
Building Management Systems, which is the exploitation of existing infrastructures.
BETaaS concept aims to prove through this scenario, that it can extend proprietary
systems in order to result in integrated solutions with multiple services and capabilities.
The ﬁrst sub-scenario of the Home Domain presents the steps that a user would do in
order to cover a need, which is the deployment of an application that is managing the
garden watering. In this scenario, the main actor downloads the app from a marketplace
and is exploiting a number of proprietary systems that can be upgraded into BETaaS
enabled gateways. Therefore devices such as thermometer, humidity sensor, etc. can be
exploited from the home BMS. Additional devices that are required, e.g. electronic
watering valve, has to be installed and controlled by another BETaaS gateway. The
second sub-scenario of the Home Domain is focusing on the case of a user who already
has an alarm system installed for his home, but still he would be interested for an
extension of the alarm to cover the entry points of the building, i.e. front door of the
building and garage automatic door. In this scenario, again he downloads (or writes) an
application that exploits the capabilities of the home alarm, which is upgraded to
become BETaaS enabled, and extends its services by managing some additional
devices (Things) that are required to extend the coverage of the alarm.

Conclusions
The paper presents the Things as a Service environment for future M2M applications,
proposed by BETaaS. The challenges and the implementation of BETaaS are descri-
bed, as well as the indicative scenarios and applications. Unlike many IoT and M2M
approaches, BETaaS is a tangible platform that aims become an open-source com-
munity to further develop the source code and achieve the highest impact. We strongly
believe the clear advances of BETaaS and in the future work we are considering to
prepare the community and all stakeholders for the evolution of M2M applications.

Abstract. The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a dramatic shift in how
computing and communication interrelate. Devices can potentially connect to
anything at any time in any place. While many researchers focus on how to
make the IoT seamless, faster, and add more devices into the mesh, our
approach is to introduce a new approach whereby devices not only communi-
cate, but also have a level of context awareness that results in optimal intelli-
gence among the mesh of connected devices.

Introduction
The numbers of smart devices are increasing almost exponentially. The capabilities of
these devices are increasing daily. The ability for these devices to interact is increasing
exponentially as mobile and telecom networks continue to expand. In the past, smart
devices and their associated network were built for purpose. A network of medical
devices knows which other devices are or may be available and understand how to
interact.
It is when an unknown number or type of devices exist on the same network that
the speciﬁcs of how these devices interact and respond to commands becomes a
problem. An algorithm and approach for determining which device is best suited to
respond to a command must be implemented.
1.1
Background
Imagine walking into a room full of smart devices. There are tablets and phones. An
Xbox360 is sitting next to the SmartTV. A DVR sits next to the television. Smart
remotes sit on the coffee table. A laptop sits on the coffee table (Fig. 1).
When a command1 is made to turn the television on, which device should respond?
When a command is issued to watch a movie, which device should respond?
1 Throughout this paper, unless the situation is speciﬁc to voice commands, we use the term
“command” to refer to directives that are given by any input method (voice, keyboard, or other).

Today, it seems simple. We know which device the movie is on or which remote
we need to use to turn on the television.
In the future, this will not always be the case. There will be multiple smart devices
that can respond to a command whether it is a smart phone or tablet that have
embedded television remote applications or the Xbox360® that can respond to a
command to play a movie that may also be available on the television or DVR.
As smart devices become smarter, the ability for these different devices to recog-
nize and respond to different commands will only increase. If multiple smart devices
attempt to respond to a command, the result could be chaos. A movie could begin
playing on the Xbox, the television, and even the Netﬂix™application on a tablet.
To help bring order to this potential chaos of having a multitude of devices respond
to a command, a method of having these smart devices negotiate amongst themselves
to determine which device should respond is needed.
In order to support this capability, it is clear that smart devices will need to evolve.
Given the rate at which these devices are currently evolving, it is not a stretch to
assume that in the near future smart devices will become smarter and have the ability
determine through the context of the device, its location, and the type of command
issued, which is the best device to respond.
In this paper, we lay out the case for a context-aware negotiation-based command
determination method.
1.2
The Evolution of Smart Devices
There are many types of devices becoming connected. There are many examples of
“smart things” that exist, such as wireless sensor and actuator networks, and embedded
devices [1]. Smart devices began as single purpose devices. They were purpose-built to
satisfy a single use, or command, or set of commands that they were built to satisfy.
A thermostat is a great example of a built-for-purpose smart device. An individual can
interact with the device to set the temperature in the house. The same individual can
create a program to raise and lower the thermostat during the course of a day. But, other
than potentially providing some history on the thermostat settings that is all the ther-
mostat can do.
These built-for-purpose smart devices are typically hardware based and have lim-
ited ability to learn.

Today, multipurpose devices are becoming more prevalent. These are devices that
are capable of fulﬁlling a range of requests. A smart phone or next-generation television
are excellent examples of multi-purpose devices. They are capable of responding to
multiple types of requests. They can access the Internet. They can play movies. They
can make phone calls.
Multi-purpose devices can sometimes have also primary and secondary purposes –
the primary purpose of a television is obvious. As part of our interconnected world,
televisions are now able to connect to the Internet. Because of these secondary capa-
bilities, devices such as smart televisions may be able to fulﬁll multiple types of request –
but may not be the most appropriate device in the network to respond to a request.
1.3
Problems with Current Networks of Interconnected Devices
When the network of devices is known and the purpose and function of each device is
clearly deﬁned, it is relatively straight forward and simple to deﬁne which device
should respond to which command.
It is when there are several, or many independent devices available for a similar
task that challenges rise. Part of the challenge is to achieve interoperability between
connected devices while maintaining their “smartness” and allowing for adaptive and
autonomous behavior [2]. This implies that the devices need to remain true to their
purpose, but also capable of negotiating with other devices trying to fulﬁll similar tasks.
There are precursors to the connectivity of autonomous devices to build from.
Sensor networks are collections of connected devices that are autonomous, but coor-
dinate and communicate for a single purpose. Each device in the network has the same
task and is responsible for collecting and transmitting data. The design of these net-
works focused on coordination to transmit data (see Fig. 2).
Early challenges with sensor networks, such as network discovery, control and
routing, collaborative information processing, tasking and querying, and security all set
a foundation for connecting smart devices and the basis for this proposal [3]. Pervasive
computing also set a foundation for communication between devices and coordination
around responding to requests [4].
Networks of smart devices have advanced to become ecosystems of devices all
collectively providing a function for a “user”. Examples of hospitals with many
monitoring devices or automated homes such as shown in Fig. 3 with devices provided
an array of functions.
Fig. 2. Source-destination
316
F. Bauerle et al.
www.ebook3000.com

Even in these advanced ecosystems, the coordination and negotiation between
devices is not for who can fulﬁll a request, but connecting, authorizing, and transferring
collected data.
When several devices can fulﬁl a request and only one is required to do so, a whole
new type of negotiation is needed. The next ﬁgure represents the high level steps
required for this next evolution of negotiation (Fig. 4).
The ﬁrst step is discovery and identiﬁcation: what the request being made, who is
requesting it, and why it is needed. This request might be sent to multiple devices all
capable of responding to a request. Once discovered and identiﬁed, the devices need to
collaborate on a proper response. Previous work has been done providing a coordinated
layer response [5].
The proposal for this paper is to go beyond the existing work. Many proposals
focus on a centralized coordinator for devices, which may be possible in dedicated
networks of known systems [1]. In an IoT environment, each device is autonomous and
may not exist in a known or dedicated environment. To do that, the context of a request
needs to be taken into account. A coordinated response among entities using services,
nodes, equipment, and the infrastructure must use a speciﬁc context [6].
2
Proposed Solution
When the network and paths are not predeﬁned, the ability of this dynamic network of
smart devices to interact with each other becomes much more difﬁcult. Our goal is to
establish negotiation between a set of existing intelligent devices, all of which are
capable of performing the same or similar task, to determine which device should
perform a task.

317

In order to determine whether to respond to a command, the devices need to be
aware of a number of variables. They need to be aware of where they are. They need to
be aware of who issued the command. They need to ultimately determine through
negotiation which device is best suited to respond.
2.1
Solution Overview
In this paper, we describe a solution and approach by which a dynamic network of
smart devices can negotiate among themselves to determine which device is algo-
rithmically better to respond to a given command.
Our focus is on two aspects of this solution.
1. The devices themselves – what must they be capable of supporting and doing to
support the contextual response required. The devices must be capable of
responding to a given command in order to be viable.
2. The interactions between the devices - how must the interactions be identiﬁed, the
context understood, and the negotiations between the devices be done to determine
best ﬁt and most appropriate response
It must be clearly stated that being context aware is key to this solution. The devices
and the device interactions must all be aware of the context of the command.
Within this solution, a command is given – spoken, sent, etc. – over standard
protocols – and the appropriate devices respond to the request.
The response must be given in context – meaning that the responding device must
understand:
(1) Is it capable of responding – can it fulﬁll the command being given?
(2) Where is the device now – understanding the context of location and network
(3) Who gave the command – understanding the context of the command giver
(4) Is the device authorized to respond to the command?
(5) Is it the appropriate device to respond? Is there another device in the network that
can fulﬁll the response more effectively?
In this context sensitive device interaction, when a command is spoken, there may be
multiple devices that are capable of responding. The following diagram shows a
command being issued to a potential set of devices (Fig. 5).
These devices must understand that there are other devices in the area that may be
capable of responding. When a command is given, the devices must collaborate, and
based on the available contexts (who gave the command, where was the command
given, etc.), determine how to respond. As the following diagram shows, as the number
of enabled smart devices grows, the networks of devices can become increasingly
complex. Having a standard way of determining which device should respond will
become increasingly important (Fig. 6).
The ﬁrst decision is both the simplest and potentially the most complex to
address. For single-purpose devices, the decision is simple – am I equipped to fulﬁll the
request or am I not. A toaster is not capable of responding to a request to turn on the
television – or to ﬁnd directions to the nearest sushi restaurant.
318
F. Bauerle et al.
www.ebook3000.com

The simplest case is when there is a single device in the area that can fulﬁll a
request. For example, if a request is made to toast some bread, the only device that has
the capability to perform that action is the toaster (Fig. 7).

In this instance, the toaster would attempt to negotiate with any devices that might
be able to fulﬁll the request. Finding no other devices in the vicinity that can fulﬁll the
request, the toaster would then perform the action.
Using a more complex example, if a command is given, such as ‘turn on the
television’, there may be multiple devices that can fulﬁll the request. Smart phones and
tablets now can run applications that allow the device to perform as a television remote
control. The second question must be addressed by the network of devices – which
device should respond (Fig. 8)?
In this example, when the command is given, the devices must ﬁrst answer the
question “can I fulﬁll the request?” For the purpose of simplicity, only 2 of the smart
phones, the tablet, and the smart television are all capable of turning on the television.
The question that must be answered is – which device (of those four) is the most
appropriate to respond to the request.
In the example above, the television itself is the most appropriate device to respond
and so, responds by turning on the television (Fig. 9).
Turn on

Another factor is understanding and determining which devices are authorized to
respond. A device may be capable of responding – but it may not be authorized to
respond.
In deﬁning this, we look at both implicit and explicit authorization, as well as rule
sets. Implicit authorization may be leveraged for simple commands – which device
should turn on the television. When the devices negotiate, there may be multiple
devices that are capable of responding. The devices may have no explicit rules set up
for responding (or not responding). Instead, the device that best satisﬁes the rules will
win the handshake between the devices.
In the example of a command being given to ‘turn on the television’, the network of
devices must determine which devices can respond. During negotiations, those devices
that are capable of responding should determine which device is implicitly the best
device to respond – in this instance, the television is capable of turning on directly
without going through a remote. In this instance, the television will turn on directly.
Explicit authorization exists in this model to satisfy multiple situations. First,
the owner of the device may elect to change the rules so that the remote takes pre-
cedence over the smart television. In this situation, when the command is given, the
rule establishing the order of precedence and which device should respond has been set
to authorize the smart remote instead of the smart television directly.
In other situations, explicit authorization is important to prevent accidental or
intentional misuse. If a command to ‘phone home’ is given, the devices must be
intelligent enough to understand the nature of the request and who is typically asso-
ciated with that request. In a network of devices, each device must understand that
based on the context of the request that it and it alone are qualiﬁed to make the request.
Before responding to the request, the device should know who gave the request. It
may not be sufﬁcient for the device to simply respond to the request based on whether it
was capable of responding or was the best device based on feature/function. It must
also be authorized to respond. In this case, commands to dial the phone is restricted to
the phones owner (Fig. 10).
If the person who spoke the command is not the phones owner, the request will be
ignored. Another smart device in the network may be set up to respond to that request –
but the smart device that we are referring to is explicitly set up to only respond to the
owners voice for this particular command.

Finally, the device must be aware of where it is located. Many devices today have
this capability in some limited fashion. For example, smart phones and tablets are
aware of surrounding wi-ﬁnetworks – and automatically connect to the appropriate
SSID when the opportunity presents itself – as well as being aware of their physical
location via GPS coordinates.
This solution carries the analogy a bit further. The smart device must know where it
is located in order to know whether it should respond to a particular request (Fig. 11).
In the case when a call to 911 is made in a vehicle, the enabled smart devices must
recognize where they are. As the devices begin negotiating to determine which device
should respond, the Onstar device should assert that it is the most appropriate device to
respond because it is part of the vehicle – as such, it should take responsibility for
making the call. Based on the negotiation rules, all other enabled smart devices should
submit to this assertion.
2.2
The Solution Stack
Logically, the solution adds a ‘negotiation layer’ to smart devices that helps the devices
negotiate and determine which device is the best device to respond (Fig. 12).
The solution stack diagram above describes the basic device stack. It begins once a
command is given – either to a software-enabled smart device or a hardware-enabled
smart device. These commands are received and responses provided on a deﬁned
transport layer.
Within the device, once the command is received, the device must determine
whether it is capable of responding to a given command. A decision not to respond can
be made because the device is not capable of responding or because according to the
rules associated with the command on the device, it is not authorized to respond.
Starting from the top of the stack and moving down,
1. The transport and protocol for communicating between devices should not matter to
this solution. Because Bluetooth® technology is prevalent today, we assume that it

is the transport for the inter-device communications today, but it is not a require-
ment for our proposal. As technologies evolve, other transport technologies may
take precedence and become the standard.
2. All devices must have the capability of recognizing the command - and be able to
respond based on some set of rules. This context-aware negotiation module is used
to determine whether a device should respond to a given command and to negotiate
with other devices on which device in the network is most appropriate to respond.
3. Assuming more complex smart devices, there are special purpose software modules
that may exist on the device and that may be able to respond to a request.
4. All devices will have some level of hardware involved - this layer is shown to
capture the fact that both simple and complex devices are part of this ecosystem.
Responding to a Command. Assuming a device is capable and authorized to respond,
when a command is recognized, the context aware device negotiation module is
invoked and needs to determine how to respond.
When a command is issued, the sequence for determining which device responds
should be as shown in Fig. 13 - Command Processing.
Deﬁning the Rules for Responding to a Command. When the command is received
by a device, the device should determine whether it is capable of fulﬁlling the request.
Each of the devices that validate, authenticate, and authorize the command, will then
negotiate with the other devices in the network to determine which device is best suited
to respond.
There will be times when the negotiation is simple – in the case of a smart toaster in
a network of smart devices, only the toaster is capable of responding to a command to
‘toast bread’.

In other instances, multiple devices may be capable of responding to a command.
In this instance, a set of rules to sort and prioritize devices must be established. Rules
should be established to understand
• Who spoke the command? Is the owner of the device the person who spoke the
command?
• Where was the command spoken?
– Was it spoken in a car?
– What network is the device on currently? Wi-ﬁ? 4G? etc.
• What is the social weighting of the application?
• How did the owner of the device rate or prioritize the applications on their device?
Weights or scores will be assigned to the different contexts and rules to help the devices
respond with their ability to respond and their worthiness of responding. Weight may
be given to the owner of the device in many cases to allow device afﬁnity. In other
cases, the network or connectivity of a device to a network – whether the device is LTE
or 4G capable and can respond on a higher speed network - may skew the command
toward a particular device.
Using the iteration or recursive model, the devices will broadcast their scores to the
other devices. The device with the highest score will be conﬁrmed – that device will
then respond to the command.

If it is determined that the message is a new command, a set of rules will be
evaluated - the attached table provides an example set of potential rules that could be
embedded within each device (Table 1).
For some devices, the rules will be rigid - especially for single purpose devices. The
rules for those devices that are multi-purpose may be customizable - through the device
settings - or through a special application.
Where the time to respond to a command is critical, rules may be established to
immediately execute the command without iteratively negotiating with other devices.
In the case of a call to emergency services, it is more critical to reach emergency
services than to determine the best device to execute the call. To prevent mis-use of this
feature, rules may be embedded to only allow commands to be completed if initiated by
the device owner.
Rules can be stored locally or centrally – depending on how the solution is ulti-
mately implemented, there can be multiple layers of rules – general and context speciﬁc.
• Static rules will exist when a device only has one purpose (in the case of a toaster
who can only toast bread) or soft rules
• Context sensitive rules will exist when the context of a command needs to be
evaluated before responding to a request.
Whether stored centrally or distributed on each device, the rules must all be uniquely
identiﬁed and associated with a given command. When the device recognizes the

command, it would retrieve or consult the rules for that command and determine
whether the device should respond and if so, how it should respond (Table 2).
Negotiating Iterating to Determine Which Device Should Respond. Once a device
receives a command and responds with its intent to respond, it should evaluate the rules
for the given command and respond to the network of other devices that have indicated
they can satisfy the command.
The device will evaluate the rules and respond with a message that indicates the
command that was given, the timestamp that the device responded, the device-speciﬁc
command ID, and the other information (Table 3).
After evaluating the rules, each receiving device will respond with a status - it could
indicate that it is a viable device - it could also concede because it doesn’t ﬁt the rules.
There may be instances when the weights or scores reported by the devices in a
network will be the same – in that case, a set of rules to break the deadlock condition
should be established – in many cases, the ﬁrst device to react to the negotiation request
will be given priority to respond to the command.
In the example of a command to ‘ﬁnd a sushi restaurant’, each of the devices
capable of providing a response to that command should consult their rules database
and determine the weight or score of their response.
The score may be inﬂuenced by the default application on a particular device, who
spoke the command, or the location of the device. In the example of a device owner
asking, the device may assign a higher score because of device ownership – or even the
fact that the device is OnStar capable device and the command was spoken in a car.
The device will communicate their score to the other devices in the network. Those
that are still vying to fulﬁll the request will evaluate the scores against their score.

The devices will broadcast a response indicating whether they want to assume control
or will submit to one of the other devices in the network.
Using the context sensitive device negotiation solution, the devices would interact
with each other and based on a set of general or context-speciﬁc rules determine how to
respond.
The devices will iterate in the context sensitive negotiation phase until only a single
device responds. With our solution, devices can understand – based on the network of
other devices and the rules governing the device – which device should respond to a
request. With the ever increasing proliferation of smart devices in our world, being able
to issue a command and have the appropriate device respond is becoming increasingly
important. In this solution, based on a command, the enabled devices in the network
can determine which devices are capable of responding and then negotiate which
device should respond to the request.
2.3
Negotiating as a Service
The negotiation described thus far is peer-to-peer between devices to determine the best
device between a set of acknowledged devices. In some situations, this may not be
enough.
There are cases where 2 or more devices may be capable of handling a request just
as well as any other. In these cases, an arbitrator could help decide which device to
select.
Additionally, in a known location, you may want to control which device responds
to a command even if you don’t “own” the devices in the network. Examples of this
include a hospital device ecosystem where you only want certain devices responding
and you want to control which devices respond in a given situation. Even though a
device may be authorized to be on the network, you may not want it to perform some
actions.
Another example can be found in the workplace where smart phones are often
allowed to access the corporate network. You may want to authorize the phone to
respond to some commands but not others – for example, “download ﬁle” may not be a
command that you want to allow your phone to fulﬁll.
Negotiation as a service is centered by the existence of an arbitrator. The arbitrator
would understand which devices, commands, and rules it may arbitrate. The arbitrator
would also recognize all commands and receive all responses from available devices.
The arbitrator would then arbitrate and evaluate all responses – and determine which
device should respond to a given command. The next ﬁgure shows a high level view of
this (Fig. 14).
The negotiation starts with each device that has similar capabilities contacting the
arbitrator and sending its identiﬁcation. The arbitrator uses the identity of the devices
and their capabilities to determine the appropriate device to respond.
The next 2 ﬁgures illustrate this interaction (Fig. 15).
The processing done by the arbitrator includes a similar set of rules that were
described in the peer-to-peer model. After the arbitrator selects a device, the user may
Context Sensitive Smart Device Command Recognition and Negotiation
327

override that selection for another device. That override is collected and saved as a rule
adjustment by the arbitrator. In this way, a social aspect of arbitration is introduced as
people build up the rule engine for which devices work in certain conditions for certain
sets of devices (Fig. 16).
Arbitrators can exist in multiple conﬁgurations. They can be distributed,
centralized, or tiered. Tiered arbitrators can ﬁrst department, then division, then
corporate-wide.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we introduced a new approach focusing on context awareness that could
be implemented in the Internet of Things. Commands are responded to based on many
factors that theIoT could negotiate to determine the best device to respond. This
approach would add an additional layer of intelligence into the IoT landscape. This
approach paves the way for IoTaaS where IoT are integrated through a layer of context
awareness that enables the whole paradigm as a service.
We also introduced how negotiation could be done as a service to give and addition
layer of “intelligence” to the IoT device ecosystem.

Future Work
There are several areas we have identiﬁed that warrant further investigation. One of
these areas is around security. If you, or someone else, gives a verbal command that a
set of IoT devices are capable of responding to, but not owned by the requestor, how is
that handled? Can I request that my neighbors’ oven turn on? A level of authentication
and authorization needs to be introduced into the system.
We are planning to build a prototype to illustrate the context awareness aspect and
command negotiation in IoT. In addition, we are looking at the concept of device
training where the IoT is updated or reduced by one or more devices. How the device
introduce itself to the mesh of things, and how the network will be updated to included
new contexts that been monitored by the new devices.

Abstract. To optimize energy consumption, it is needed to monitor
real-time data and simulate all energy ﬂows. In a city district context,
energy consumption data usually come from many sources and encoded
in diﬀerent formats. However, few models have been proposed to trace
the energy behavior of city districts and handle related data. In this arti-
cle, we introduce DIMCloud, a model for heterogeneous data manage-
ment and integration at district level, in a pervasive computing context.
Our model, by means of an ontology, is able to register the relation-
ships between diﬀerent data sources of the district and to disclose the
sources locations using a publish-subscribe design pattern. Furthermore,
data sources are published as Web Services, abstracting the underlying
hardware from the user’s point-of-view.

Introduction
A single district and urban model is necessary for many purposes, including:
(i) design or refurbishment of buildings; (ii) maintenance and monitoring of
energy consumption; (iii) data visualization for increasing user awareness. Unfor-
tunately, the design of such model is more diﬃcult than collecting and analyzing
data. For example, the diﬀerent technologies used to collect such data produce
heterogeneous information, which is diﬃcult to integrate. Moreover, data com-
ing from diﬀerent platforms are encoded with a speciﬁc data format, and there-
fore not portable. Furthermore, data is usually stored in diﬀerent locations and
accessed using diﬀerent protocols.
A common scenario involves diﬀerent technologies. For instance, Building
Information Model Systems (BIMs) [7] build a 3D parametric model of buildings,
enriched with semantic information, such as measures, materials and costs [11].

On the other hand, Geographic Information Systems (GISs) [15] map the geo-
graphical location of buildings, energy distribution networks or other elements
(such as smart meters). GISs are used for data automation and compilation,
management, analysis and modeling of advanced cartography [5]. Finally, it is
possible to have System Information Models (SIM) databases, to outline the
structure of energy distribution networks with a 3D parametric model, and mea-
surements databases, to store data collected by sensors.
In addition, a district model must satisfy the following constraints: (i) the
use of underlying hardware (e.g. sensors) must be transparent from the user’s
point-of-view; (ii) each data source must be able to be registered into the sys-
tem without needing to restart the whole infrastructure; (iii) the system must
communicate by means of shared open protocols; (iv) the system must handle
the data integration; (v) the data format must be open and independent from
data source.
Currently, we believe there is a lack of interoperability, regarding information
exchange, in district information management. Hereby we propose a distributed
infrastructure for district management, which integrates and interconnects diﬀer-
ent models [6] and data sources, and delivers information by means of Web Ser-
vices. This article is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the state-of-art in the
ﬁelds of heterogeneous devices integration and BIM/GIS integration. Section 3
introduces the DIMCloud concept, outlining the diﬀerent aspects of the system.
Finally, Sect. 4 reports conclusions and future directions.

Background
Nowadays, one of the major challenges in Ubiquitous Computing and Internet of
things concerns the interoperability between heterogeneous devices. Considering
a district context, this problem is even more challenging. However, middleware
technologies and Services Oriented Architectures (SOA) [10] can be considered
as the key issue to provide low-cost integration for enabling the communication
between such heterogeneous devices. In the context of big environments, such
as buildings and public spaces, middleware technologies should implement the
abstraction software layer, which is the key issue to achieve a true interoperabil-
ity between heterogeneous devices. In addition, they should also integrate the
already existing and deployed Building Management Systems. The authors of [2]
developed a modular open infrastructure, which is a complete SOA ecosystem
designed to provide the capabilities of the integrated embedded devices. Finally,
Stavropoulos et al. [14] introduces the aWESoME middleware, which provides
uniform access to the heterogeneous Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks
(WSAN), enabling fast and direct discovery, invocation and execution of ser-
vices.
Several concepts have been proposed to integrate heterogeneous data and to
promote information exchange. For instance, [8] integrated BIM and GIS data to

provide a Supply Chain Management framework for Construction. In this case,
the BIM model traced cost and materials, while the GIS model minimized the
logistics costs. Microsoft Access was used for information exchange. The authors
of [4] proposed the USIM concept, an Indoor GIS Building Information Model
for context-aware [3] applications. The compatibility was achieved following the
IFC standard. In [8] the integration of GIS and BIM models optimized the instal-
lation of tower cranes. The GIS model located tower cranes to minimize conﬂicts
between them. On the other hand, the BIM model represented each tower crane
area to check the spatial coverage of the system, and was used to estimate the
operator point-of-view. The BIM model was exported using a database (e.g. with
Microsoft Access). In [9] the authors used Schema-Level Model Views, i.e. partial
sub-models taken from the BIM (IFC) model and translated to the geo-spatial
context into a ESRI Geodatabase (geo-spatial1 database) or a ESRI Shapeﬁle
(a ﬁle format used to represent the geo-relational model2).
On the other hand, from the district energy consumption point-of-view, [16]
introduced the CDIM (City District Information model) concept, which aim at
integrating and managing data, to support the conception and the simulation of
district energy consumption. CDIM integrates data by means of object-relational
databases.
In our work, we propose a framework for simulation and visualization of
energy consumption in a district context, by means of middleware and SOA
concepts. To achieve it, the framework enriches BIM and SIM with real-time
data collected by devices deployed in buildings and energy distribution networks.
3
Distributed Framework for District Energy Simulation
and Management
In a Smart Cities context, we designed our concept DIMCloud (District Informa-
tion Model Cloud) to ease the visualization and simulation of energy consump-
tion in a city district. DIMCloud (depicted in Fig. 1(a)) links the district energy
consumption data with semantic and geographic information, such as the build-
ing in which the data has been collected. In this way, it is possible to monitor
in real-time the district as a whole or with a more ﬁne-grained perspective, e.g.
each single house, abstracting the pervasive distributed infrastructure of sensors.
DIMCloud abstracts data sources by means of a set of speciﬁc proxies, contained
in the data layer. Each proxy responds to data requests retrieving the correspon-
dent data, adapting them to a district context (for instance, labeling them as
belonging to a speciﬁc building) and converting them to a shared unique format.
There are two types of proxy: Device-proxy, if data comes from a device (see
Sect. 3.1), Database-proxy, if data comes from a database (see Sect. 3.2). The
requests enter the integration layer and are dispatched to the correct proxy by

the cloud’s master node, as shown in Fig. 1(a). The references between diﬀerent
databases are modeled by means of an ontology and are exploited by the master
node during the integration of diﬀerent data (for instance, to integrate the data
of a building with its geographical location and sensors measurements).
DIMCloud exploits the SEEMPubS service-oriented middleware [12]. It pro-
vides components, called managers, to develop distributed software based on both
user-centric and event-based approaches. SEEMPubS, thanks to the Network
Manager, is in charge to establish a peer-to-peer communication across the diﬀer-
ent entities in the middleware network. The SEEMPubS event-based approach is
given by the Event Manager, which implements a publish/subscribe model. Hence,
the middleware allows the development of loosely-coupled event-based systems
removing all the explicit dependencies between the interacting entities. Finally,
the concept of SEEMPubS Proxy [13] has been extended to enable the interop-
erability between heterogeneous devices and also to integrate the diﬀerent data-
bases, as described respectively in Sects. 3.1 and 3.2. It abstracts and eases the
integration of a speciﬁc technology, device or service into a SEEMPubS applica-
tion providing Web Services and registering it at a Network Manager.
3.1
Enabling Interoperability Across Heterogeneous Devices
Figure 1(b) summarizes the schema designed to implement the Proxy, which inte-
grates heterogeneous devices into the DIMCloud and enables the interoperability
between them. The Device-Proxy is a service layer for abstracting the underly-
ing heterogeneous wireless and wired technologies. Diﬀerent Device-Proxies, one
for each considered technology, were developed to provide the following main
features:
www.ebook3000.com

DIMCloud: A Distributed Framework
335
– enabling the integration of heterogeneous devices and interfacing them to the
whole proposed infrastructure by means of Web Services, through which access
sensor data;
– collecting environmental data coming from sensor nodes into a local database,
which can be accessed in an asynchronous way and protected against network
failures;
– pushing environmental information into the infrastructure via an event-based
approach, thanks to the Event Manager;
– allowing the remote control of actuator devices.
Therefore, the Device-Proxy, as shown in Fig. 1(b), is a software which commu-
nicates directly with the heterogeneous networks and consists of three layers.
The dedicated Interface, the lowest layer, directly receives all the incoming data
from the devices, regardless of communication protocols, hardware or network
topology. Each technology needs a speciﬁc software Interface, which interprets
environmental data (e.g. Temperature, Humidity, Power Consumption, etc.) and
stores them in an integrated database, which is in the second layer. Since data
are stored locally, the database makes the whole infrastructure ﬂexible and reli-
able with respect to backbone network failures. Finally, the SEEMPubS Web
Services layer interfaces the diﬀerent technologies to other components of the
infrastructure, easing remote management and control, and enabling the inter-
operability between heterogeneous devices. From this layer, trough the Event
Manager, real-time data collected by sensors are sent to other applications, such
as the Measurements Database, which collects data coming from the district’s
devices.
In particular, we developed proxies for IEEE 802.15.4, ZigBee and EnOcean
protocols, which are wireless technologies. Moreover, about wired technologies,
it was developed a speciﬁc proxy to allow the interoperability with the OPC
Uniﬁed Architecture3, which incorporates all the features provided by diﬀerent
standards, such as SCADA or BACnet.
3.2
Abstracting Underlying Data Sources
Diﬀerent databases store district data. Unfortunately, the integration to a unique
database is not feasible, because of heterogeneity (diﬀerent formats) and con-
ﬂicting values (the same key can be used to identify diﬀerent objects in diﬀerent
databases). Furthermore, the update of such database would be laborious.
In our distributed infrastructure, each database is accompanied with an inter-
face (Database-proxy), which provides data retrieval from the database publish-
ing a Web Service. Simultaneously, a master node of the infrastructure stores the
relationships between the available proxies into an ontology. In this way, the user
queries a single entry point (the master node) to receive proxies URIs. After-
wards, s/he receives the Web Service URIs of the proxies and the relationships
between them. Finally, s/he retrieves the data using the proxies’ Web Services
and is able to integrate them.

Information Modeling and Data Export
To export the models behind the Database-proxies in the DIMCloud, it was
necessary to use Autodesk Revit and ESRI ArcGIS 10. The Level of Development
and the Level of Detail were carefully chosen before the modeling step, referring
to the American Institute of Architects (A.I.A.)4. In Revit we developed the
model of the building with Local Masses. Afterwards, we enriched the BIM model
with semantic information. The building and the context models were oriented
and located appropriately. In addition, more informations could be inserted using
Shared parameters. Working on ArcGIS, we deﬁned the geographic coordinates’
system and we made shapeﬁles (.shp) of buildings and of addresses. Shapeﬁles
are used to store non-topological geometries and attribute informations [1], such
as construction typology or data, and were developed to describe the GIS model.
Parametric models need an export/import process, to share data between
diﬀerent applications. Therefore, several formats have to be tested to avoid errors
and data losses. For instance, IFC5 and CityGML6 are two predominant standard
exchange formats in the building industry. We decided to export BIM and GIS
models by means of relational databases.
3.4
Exploiting Ontologies to Relate District Entities
When the master node search for the Web Service’s URI of data source, it refers
to an ontology. The ontology stores a model for the whole district. This model
is a tree, in which the root node identiﬁes the district and its global properties
(e.g. Web Services for GIS Database-Proxy URI), and deﬁnes the relationships
between diﬀerent data sources. In the ontology each node connected to the root
node describes a building or an energy distribution network, and it is labeled
with a unique id. Each node stores:
– the Web Service’s URIs for both BIM or SIM Database-Proxy;
– the ID of the BIM or SIM in the GIS Database-Proxy;
– a dictionary containing, for each sensor, its ID in the measurements’ database.
Figure 2 depicts the ontology’s schema. From the root node, it is possible to reach
every data source in the district. Each found leaf node discloses the necessary
references to query the related data sources.

Use Case: District Data Query
Figure 3 depicts the sequence diagram to retrieve the data related to a district,
which can include real-time measurements, BIM and SIM models for N selected
buildings and energy distribution networks respectively. The Client, for instance
an application for simulation or data visualization, asks the Master (step 1) for

data and Web Services URIs (proxies). The Master checks the ontology and
returns (2) all the information for the requested GIS, BIM, SIM and their rela-
tive measurements. In (3) the Client asks for geographical data for the required
BIM and SIM IDs to the GIS proxy, which responds in (4). Afterwards, the Client
retrieves measurements data from the Measurements Proxy (5, 6). Finally, in (7)
and (8), in (9) and (10) and, generically, in (BRn) and (BSn) and in (SRn) and
(SSn), the Client retrieves the data from the N BIM and SIM models invoking the
Web Services for the related proxies.

Conclusions
The CDIM approach [16] showed that a district-based simulation can be bene-
ﬁcial to optimize energy consumption, with respect to BIM simulations. In our
work, we introduced a diﬀerent model for the district, i.e. DIMCloud, in which
each data source is reachable by means of a Web Service proxy. The underly-
ing hardware is available as a service, and the user can query in the same way
heterogeneous sources, to monitor real-time energy consumption in the district.

We think that the proposed system can be of crucial importance to manage
district energy data, in order to develop energy consumption awareness and
sustainability in smart district scenarios.

Abstract. Internet-of-Things (IoT) is poised for a disruptive growth in near
future with wide and easy deployments of sensor connected to Internet. Hori-
zontal service platforms for IoT are increasingly gaining prominence for quick
development and deployment of IoT applications. However, IoT application
development needs diverse skill and knowledge from domain, analytics, infra-
structure and programming, which is difﬁcult to ﬁnd in one application devel-
oper. In this paper we introduce a Model-driven-development (MDD)
framework that tries to address the above issue by separating out the concern of
different stakeholders through models and knowledgebases.

Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) has already been recognized by researchers and analysts as
one of the most disruptive technologies that will transform human lives and have major
economic impact. People foresee lot of penetration of IoT technology in large-scale,
complex applications such as Smart Cities, Smart Transportation, Smart Manufactur-
ing, Smart Healthcare etc. Given the complexity of the system, there is increasing
requirement for IoT development platforms providing different services.
In this paper we present the case for a model-driven framework to develop and
deploy IoT applications and services on top of an IoT platform. In Sect. 2, we present
the requirements of such a framework and provide a technology gap analysis. In
Sect. 3, we present the proposed Model-driven-development (MDD) framework for
IoT platforms. Finally we summarize and conclude in Sect. 4.

Need for Model-Driven-Development in IoT
IoT applications, traditionally, like all other embedded applications, are built bottom up
as per vertical requirements. It starts with sensor integration, moving into sensor data
collection using sensor networking, storing the collected data and ﬁnally analyzing the
stored data to draw actionable insights [1, 2].
However, instead of taking the bottom-up vertical approach for application
development, it is beneﬁcial to have a horizontal, platform-driven approach [3].

A model-driven-development (MDD) approach that can abstract out the meta-
model of the IoT system and automate much of the application development process
allowing the application developer to focus only on domain speciﬁc concerns will be of
high interest to the industry.
Many of the existing IoT service platforms, support features like user management,
resource provisioning, application life cycle management, device management and
conﬁguration, connectivity service provisioning and management etc. [3]. Another
such platform (TCS Connected Universe Platform - TCUP) [4] tries to address a few of
the above concerns by providing an integrated application development platform
covering device management, data storage and management, an API based application
development framework and a distributed application deployment framework.
However, none of these actually addresses the issues related to ease of application
development like code reusability, need for multiple skills in domain, analytics, sen-
sors, programming etc., or visibility of data across application.. These can be addressed
through the concept of separation of concerns among different stakeholders – this has
been already prevalent in the area of MDD and recently it has been also applied in the
context of IoT [5, 6] which provides a framework to specify the requirements at
different levels. However, this framework does not address issues like analytics algo-
rithm re-use, distributed execution of analytics, generation of analytics and reasoning
workﬂows, a common ontology and semantics for sensor data etc. needed for a full-
ﬂedged MDD.
On MDD systems implementation side, OASIS [12] has brought out a new stan-
dard meta model for IT services “The Topology and Orchestration Speciﬁcation for
Cloud Applications” (TOSCA) [13] for improving portability of cloud applications to
address the challenges related to heterogeneous application environments. In TOSCA,
the structure of a service is deﬁned by the Topology Template, a directed graph, which
consists of Node Templates and Relationship Templates. Node Template is an
instantiation of Node Type which deﬁnes the properties and operations of a component.
TOSCA uses plans, a process model deﬁning complex workﬂows that can be used for
the management process of creating, deploying and terminating services. TOSCA
speciﬁes an XML based syntax for deﬁning the entities described above. For the plans
it relies on existing business process modeling languages such as BPEL [14] and
BPMN [15]. Some initial exploration has been reported on using TOSCA as a meta-
model for IoT services [11]. From our studies we observe that this approach has a
potential for addressing multiple views of the IoT application development and is much
suited for offering the services following a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model.
In this paper, we propose an integrated MDD framework as part of an IoT Service
Platform.
3
Proposed Model-Driven Framework
A typical IoT platform caters to the needs of four different types of users or stake-
holders – Applications Developers, Sensor Providers, End Users and Platform
Administrators. Out of these four types of stakeholders, the focus of the proposed
MDD framework is the Application Developer and the Sensor Provider. We further
340
A. Pal et al.
www.ebook3000.com

sub-divide sensor providers into sensor manufacturers and sensor service providers and
application developers into domain experts, application programmers and algorithm
experts. In subsequent paragraphs we show how these stakeholders interact with the
MDD framework.
3.1
Support Knowledgebase for MDD
Sensor Knowledgebase – The sensor knowledgebase is contributed by multiple
stakeholders. The sensor device manufacturer can register the sensor in the system
providing information on sensor make/model, features, operating conditions (infor-
mation that is available in datasheets of sensors) along with details on sensor com-
munication interfaces/protocols, device drivers, sensor data models etc. The sensors are
normally instantiated and provisioned in the system by the sensor service provider
where they add additional metadata like deployment time/location, user details etc. This
knowledge base then can be used by the application developer to query speciﬁc sensors
via the Sensor Explorer Interface [7].
Analytics Algorithm Knowledgebase – The analytics algorithm knowledgebase is
contributed mainly by the algorithm writers and experts. It not only contains the
archive of algorithm executables in form of libraries, it also contains metadata about
algorithms detailing their application areas, performance parameters, accuracy, CPU
complexity, memory load etc. This knowledge base can be used by the application
developers to query and look for speciﬁc algorithms suitable for their application [8].
Domain-Speciﬁc Knowledgebase – Finally the application developers are primarily
concerned about solving a speciﬁc set of domain problems. They are expected to be
having good programming skill but limited domain knowledge, sensor knowledge and
algorithm analytics knowledge. The domain-speciﬁc knowledgebase that is populated
by domain experts intend to bridge this gap by providing knowledge like mapping
between physical phenomenon and sensor observation, mapping between sensor
application and sensor technology etc.
Infrastructure Knowledgebase – Application developers, after development of
applications, need to deploy them – typically part of the applications run on edge or
gateway devices collecting sensor data and part of the applications run on the cloud [9,
10]. The infrastructure knowledgebase needs to collect information about the compute/
memory/communication capabilities of the available gateway devices, available gate-
way-to-cloud communication channels, storage capacity of the cloud and detail of
available compute hardware in infrastructure of the cloud. All this knowledgebase is
typically contributed by the System Administrator.
3.2
Proposed Model Driven Framework
Here we propose a model driven framework for easy development and life-cycle
management of IoT applications. The motivation is to use the skills of existing IT
Model-Driven Development for Internet of Things: Towards Easing the Concerns
341

workforce to easily understand and develop the IoT applications using an abstract layer
hiding the heterogeneity and complexity of underlying diverse technologies.
An IoT application in totality has multiple views and respective design concerns
(Fig. 3). Following views can be considered to capture major design dimensions (as
illustrated in Fig. 1 with their respective dependencies on knowledgebase):
Information Flow and Evolution – An IoT application can be viewed as a set of data
ﬂows from sensor to sinks (actuator, database, reports, visualizer) traversing many
computing operations that transforms the data to various information elements. This
information ﬂow can be modeled as a directed graph with nodes as computing modules
that computes the designated information element. The edges indicate the input/output
dependency relation. This also serves as a semantic model for the IoT application. It
can also map to domain ontology (Sect. 3.1) through a suitable semantic mapping.
Figure 2 depicts the ﬂow graph corresponding to an example vehicle telematics service.
Each of these nodes requires a speciﬁcation of the computing model or algorithm to
be used for computing the designated information element(s). There could be standard
re-usable computing blocks that can be used across applications or there can be

data is generated at the root nodes (Speedometer, accelerometer, GPS, fuel level)
342

application speciﬁc algorithms. Some of the computing operations may involve a
rule engine or a complex event processing. But in general they are highly domain speciﬁc
and need to be developed with the help of domain experts. The developer may seek the
help of an algorithm explorer tool (introduced in Sect. 3.1) to pick the most suitable
algorithm to compute the desired information element and specify it as a node property.
Node Binding to Devices – In a typical IoT application, sensing and computing may
span multiple devices/platforms. For example in healthcare application a smartphone
may be used to sense the vital parameters and the preprocessing, aggregation and
diagnostics may be partitioned across smart phone, and cloud platform. Here we view
the partitioning of the computing ﬂow graph into sub-graphs and binding suitable
computing devices to execute them. A sub-graph may be assigned to run on a Linux
box, or a mobile phone. Further it may use a CEP engine or a JavaME environment to
run. Speciﬁc device with its detailed speciﬁcations can be selected from the Infra-
structure Knowledgebase and set the related node property. If it is computing node then
the designated algorithm should have compatibility with the device chosen. If it is a
sensor node then the selected device should have the required support. The respective
knowledgebase (KB) described in Sect. 3.1 will be helpful in ensuring this
compatibility.
Communication of Software Modules Within and Across Devices – When the
computing operations are modularized, there is need for specifying the communication
mechanism between these modules. The connected modules within same computing
environment can use standard parameter passing mechanisms, messaging or inter-
process communication primitives. Communication across devices will require external
interfaces such as USB, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Wi-Fi 2G/3G etc. Further the nature of data
exchange may follow models of REST, Pub-Sub, Proxy etc. The edges in the ﬂow
graph model can be used to capture the communication interface details. As in the case
of device binding, the infrastructure knowledge base will be used to check the com-
patibility and consistency.
Security Bindings to Devices, Software and Information – The security schemes for
data while communicating, storage and transformation are captured in this view. The
speciﬁcation is applied to a path in the sub graph spanning two end-points. Identity,
credentials and security keys are also to be speciﬁed.
Deployment and Orchestration – This view captures the information to build the
executable software modules, test and deploy them to the target devices. Also the
speciﬁcation of operational behaviors of the entire system that need to orchestrate
during the operation is also speciﬁed in this view.
We need to have an underlying meta-model to represent all of the above dimen-
sions of an IoT service and a user friendly environment to build and deploy the
application from its speciﬁcations. Recently there is a development framework pro-
posed in [6, 7] which uses Srijan language speciﬁcations as a meta-model. In our
opinion they have some shortcomings in representing some of the speciﬁc contexts of
IoT applications including communications, temporal behavior of the system and
business process orchestrations. Probably that language can be extended to support
Model-Driven Development for Internet of Things: Towards Easing the Concerns
343

these aspects. Here we explore the use of another meta-model speciﬁed for cloud
applications.

Initial Prototype and Experimental Results
We have built an initial prototype which covers some of the aspects mentioned in the
paper. The prototype is built and tested on a set of use-cases primarily linked with the
healthcare domain. In this section, we explain the principles using one of the use-cases
where a mobile phone camera is used as an optical sensor to capture the video of a
person’s index ﬁnger using which the heart-rate is calculated based on the concepts of
PPG (photoplethysmogram) [17]. In this method, the video signal from the camera is
converted to a PPG signal which is then processed following the steps of a typical
signal processing workﬂow (as shown in Fig. 4).
To assist the application developer at each stage, several components have been
built, although each of these is at a very nascent stage, but are capable of sufﬁciently
underlying the concepts proposed in this paper. As a starting point, an application
developer must discover sensors capable of generating a video signal which can be
used for PPG. Figure 5 shows a snapshot of the SensorExplorer component (the sensor
knowledgebase) which semantically links the sensors and the metadata from which the
application developer can discover sensors using temporal/spatial/spatio-temporal
queries [18]. We have used standard technologies such as SensorML, RDF to create
ontologies for all involved entities such as sensors, algorithms etc. These graph based
models enable the development of a visual programming interface where the developer

can assemble a ﬂow graph using nodes and relations from a library. With suitable pre-
built command they can test and validate the compiled application and deploy over a
real infrastructure. The open source tool “Node_RED” [16] is an example of such
visual tool for workﬂow development which we plan to use in our implementation.
Once a sensor and the corresponding data stream is discovered, the application
developer creates the signal processing workﬂow by selecting different algorithms for
each workﬂow step. At this stage, another component, namely the Algopedia (the
algorithm knowledgebase), which is an annotated repository of algorithms (shown in
Fig. 5), assists the developer to select the algorithms based on the data type, sensor
type, and other algorithmic requirements which are available as metadata in the
algorithm ontology. The workﬂow created at this step is then tested and deployed using
information from the infrastructure knowledgebase and it has been found that the
results are comparable to the output of similar workﬂows created after numerous
experiments and considerable development effort by developers who are experienced in
the domain. The sensor and algorithm knowledgebase semantically link information of
sensors used to capture information in the healthcare domain and algorithms used to
process the signals from such sensors. As of now, the domain knowledgebase is
rudimentary in nature, but we plan to build it using information retrieved from several
sources available over the Web.

Conclusion
In this paper we have introduced a MDD based framework for application development
for IoT platforms. The concept of MDD speciﬁc to IoT is a recent one. Our proposed
framework tries to separate and abstract out concerns of different stakeholders in IoT
application development through use of models and knowledgebase, thereby improving
the ease of application development. In this paper we present the concept and possible
approaches to implement it. As future work, we intend to develop speciﬁc applications
using the proposed framework and measure the ease of application development
experienced by the developer community.

Domain Speciﬁc Modeling (DSM) as a Service
for the Internet of Things and Services
Amir H. Moin(B)

Abstract. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for developing
Sense-Compute-Control (SCC) applications for the Internet of Things
and Services (IoTS) following the Model-Driven Software Engineering
(MDSE) methodology. We review the recent approaches to MDSE and
argue that Domain Speciﬁc Modeling (DSM) suites our needs very well.
However, in line with the recent trends in cloud computing and the emer-
gence of the IoTS, we believe that both DSM creation tools and DSM
solutions that are created via those tools should also be provided to
their respective users in a service-oriented fashion through the cloud in
the IoTS. In this work, we concentrate on the latter, i.e., DSM solu-
tions that are created via a DSM creation tool. We argue that it makes
sense for the owners of a DSM solution in a domain to provide their
DSM solution as a service, following the well known Software as a Ser-
vice (SaaS) model, to the interested customers through the IoTS. Our
proposed approach concentrates on such a DSM solution for developing
SCC applications in the IoTS. However, the idea could be applied to
DSM solutions in other domains as well.

Introduction
Similar to the rapid spread of the Internet among human users in the 1990s, the
Internet Protocol (IP) is currently rapidly spreading into new domains, where
constrained embedded devices such as sensors and actuators also play an impor-
tant role. This expanded version of the Internet is referred to as the Internet
of Things (IoT) [1]. On the other hand, the convergence between Web 2.0 and
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), has led to the creation of a global SOA
on top of the World Wide Web (WWW), known as the Internet of Services
(IoS) [2]. The combination of the IoT and the IoS is referred to as the Internet
of Things and Services (IoTS). This emerging vision together with Cyber Phys-
ical Systems (CPS), in which the physical world merges with the virtual world
of cyberspace [3], are believed to have suﬃcient power to trigger the next (i.e.,
fourth) industrial revolution [4].

However, with this great power often comes an enormous degree of complexity
as well as an extremely high cost of design, development, test, deployment and
maintenance for software systems too. One of the main reasons is the multi-
disciplinary nature of the ﬁeld of the IoTS. A number of major challenges in this
ﬁeld are scalability, heterogeneity of things and services, variety of protocols,
communication among stakeholders and fast pace of technological advances.
In particular, here we are interested in Sense-Compute-Control (SCC) appli-
cations [5], a typical group of applications in the IoTS. A SCC application senses
the environment (e.g., temperature, humidity, light, UV radiation, etc.) through
sensors, performs some computation (often decentralized, i.e., distributed) and
ﬁnally prompts to take one or more actions through actuators (very often sort
of control) in the environment. There exist two main diﬀerences between these
applications in the IoTS and the similar ones in the ﬁeld of Wireless Sensor
and Actuator Networks (WSAN), a predecessor of the ﬁeld of the IoTS. First,
the scale of the network is quite diﬀerent. While WSANs typically have several
hundreds or thousands of nodes, SCC applications in the IoTS may have sev-
eral millions or billions of nodes. Second, the majority of nodes in a WSAN are
more or less similar to each other. However, here in the IoTS we have a wide
spectrum of heterogeneous devices, ranging from tiny sensor motes with critical
computational, memory and energy consumption constraints to highly capable
servers for cloud computing. Heterogeneity is a property inherited from another
predecessor ﬁeld, known as Pervasive (Ubiquitous) computing [6].
A recent trend in software engineering for dealing with complexity through
raising the level of abstraction is Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE).
In this paper, we advocate Domain Speciﬁc Modeling (DSM), a state-of-the-art
approach to the MDSE methodology, for addressing the above mentioned chal-
lenges. DSM not only provides a very high level of abstraction by letting domain
experts model the design speciﬁcations in their own technical jargon (i.e., the
domain vocabulary), but also lets complete code generation in a fully automated
manner.
The paper makes three main contributions:
1. It reviews the three mainstream recent approaches to the MDSE methodology.

above mentioned challenges and increasing the development productivity in
the domain of SCC applications in the IoTS.

in a service-oriented fashion through the cloud, called Development as a Ser-

The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the three major
recent approaches to the Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) method-
ology. In Sect. 3, we propose our novel approach for addressing the above men-
tioned challenges. This is followed by a brief literature review in Sect. 4. Finally,
we conclude and mention our future work in Sect. 5.

Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE)
In fact, the idea of applying models with diﬀerent levels of abstraction in order
to develop software according to the design intent rather than the underlying
computing environment [7], a ﬁeld that used to be better known as model-
based software engineering (or model-based development), has a long tradition
in software engineering [8], which dates back to over ﬁve decades ago. Computer-
Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools of the 1980 s and the 1990 s are the
famous examples of such eﬀorts. However, although those tools were attractive
and interesting at their time, in practice, they did not really aﬀect the software
industry too much. One major reason was that they mapped poorly to the
underlying platforms. Moreover, they were not scalable enough to support large
projects [7]. Also, their modeling language as well as code generators were all
hard-coded (ﬁxed) by tool vendors. Thus, the user of those tools had no control
on the modeling language nor on the generators in order to adapt them to his
or her needs and evolving requirements. Unfortunately, this is true for many
existing CASE tools in the present time too.
In this section, we brieﬂy review the three major recent approaches to the
MDSE methodology.
2.1
Model-Driven Architecture (MDA)
In 2001, the Object Management Group (OMG) adopted a standard architec-
tural framework for MDSE known as Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) [9],
which was a key step towards standardization and dissemination of MDSE.
MDA deﬁnes three default levels of abstraction on a system in order to address
Separation of Concerns (SoC) among the stakeholders. Firstly, a Computation
Independent Model (CIM) deﬁnes the business logic independent of any kind
of computational details and system implementation concerns. Secondly, a Plat-
form Independent Model (PIM) is created based on the CIM. The model trans-
formation from CIM to PIM is often done manually or in a semi-automated
manner by information technology and computer science experts. A PIM deﬁnes
a set of parts and services of the system independently of any speciﬁc technol-
ogy and platform. Finally, a Platform Speciﬁc Model (PSM) deﬁnes the concrete
implementation of the system on a speciﬁc platform and is generated from a PIM
by means of model-to-model transformations in an automated manner. Later,
a number of (model-to-model and) model-to-text transformations generate the
implementation including the source code out of the PSM for that speciﬁc plat-
form. The generated implementation is usually not complete and still needs some
manual development.

350

MDA uses Meta-Object Facility (MOF) for its metamodeling architecture.
The modeling languages that are used on the PIM and PSM levels are either
UML (or UML proﬁles) or other MOF- or EMOF-based Domain Speciﬁc Mod-
eling Languages (DSMLs).
Although the separation of concerns through diﬀerent levels of abstraction for
models in MDA is very interesting, in practice since iterative model reﬁnements
are typical and model transformations are very often not bidirectional, i.e., one
cannot automatically go up in the modeling layers, e.g., from PSM to PIM, due to
modiﬁcations in models on the PSM level, we will easily end up in inconsistencies
in the models and serious maintenance problems in the long term. Moreover,
another drawback of the MDA approach is that the generated code is often not
complete and still needs manual development in order to become the ﬁnal usable
product.
2.2
Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD)
Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) [10] prevents the crucial mainte-
nance problem that we mentioned for MDA by avoiding iterative model reﬁne-
ments. In other words, no round-trip engineering is performed. A model in MDSD
should have all required platform-speciﬁc details (for one or more platforms), so
that it could be directly transformed to the source code through model-to-code
transformations. Moreover, any modiﬁcations to the system should be done on
the model level.
The main concentration of a model in MDSD is on the architecture of the
software. However, the business logic is implemented manually in handwritten
code rather than being generated out of the model. Following this approach could
lead to about 60 % to 80 % of automatically generated code [11]. Furthermore,
the source code of the ﬁnal product in the MDSD approach consists of three
main parts [11]:
1. Generic code: This part of the source code is speciﬁc to each platform. The
idea is to generate this part automatically for each platform.
2. Schematic code: This part of the source code is generated out of the platform-
independent architecture model of an application through model-to-text
transformations. Depending on the target platform, the model is transformed
diﬀerently.
3. Individual code: This part is speciﬁc to each application and contains its
business logic. This part should be written by developers manually.
Similar to the MDA approach, the MDSD approach could not lead to 100 % code
generation either. Therefore, one needs to keep the generated code separated
from the handwritten code.
2.3
Domain Speciﬁc Modeling (DSM)
About ﬁve decades ago, software development was mainly shifted from the
Assembly language to high-level third-generation programming languages (3GLs)
www.ebook3000.com

Domain Speciﬁc Modeling (DSM) as a Service
351
like BASIC. This shift led to about 450 % of productivity leap on average.
However, the migration from BASIC to Java has only caused an improvement
of about 20 % in the development productivity on average. This is due to the
fact that almost all the third-generation programming languages such as BASIC,
FORTRAN, PASCAL, C, C++, Java, etc. are more or less on the same level
of abstraction. Furthermore, although models are abstract representations that
should hide complexity and one expects modeling languages to provide a higher
level of abstraction than programming languages, however, in practice, general-
purpose modeling languages such as the Uniﬁed Modeling Language (UML) often
have a one-to-one correspondence between modeling elements and code elements.
Therefore, they cannot hide the complexity so much. In fact, with both program-
ming languages and general-purpose modeling languages, developers must ﬁrst
try to solve the problem in the problem domain using the domain’s terminol-
ogy, then they should map the domain concepts to development concepts, i.e., to
source code elements in case of programming languages and to modeling elements
in case of general-purpose modeling languages without any tool support [12].
In contrast, Domain Speciﬁc Modeling (DSM) is based upon two pillars:
domain speciﬁcity and automation. The ﬁrst one means DSM lets one specify
the solution in a language that directly uses concepts and rules from a speciﬁc
problem domain rather than the programming concepts and rules (i.e., con-
cepts and rules of the solution domain). Thus, it tremendously increases the
productivity. According to many industrial reports, employing DSM solutions
in various domains has led to an average productivity leap of between 3 to 10
times (i.e., 300 % to 1000 %) comparing the general-purpose modeling and man-
ual programming approaches. The second one means complete and automated
generation of the ﬁnal product, including the source code in a programming lan-
guage, out of models without any need for further development and manual mod-
iﬁcations. This is somehow analogous to the role that compilers play for 3GLs.
Unlike domain speciﬁcity, which is also the case in some other MDSE approaches
(e.g., in some MDA- and MDSD-based approaches which use DSMLs instead of
general-purpose modeling languages such as UML), automation is an essential
property of DSM that distinguishes it from other MDSE approaches [12].

DSM as a Service
Recall from the mentioned major challenges for developing SCC applications
for the IoTS in Sect. 1 (i.e., scalability, heterogeneity of things and services,
variety of protocols, communication among stakeholders and fast pace of tech-
nological advances), we believe that DSM is the best choice to address those
challenges. Firstly, due to providing full automation and complete code genera-
tion (not only source code, but even other artifacts such as documentation, build
scripts, conﬁguration ﬁles, etc.), it helps a lot in dealing with the scalability chal-
lenges. Secondly, diﬀerent code generators (i.e., model-to-text transformations)
can generate the implementation and APIs for diﬀerent heterogeneous hardware
and software platforms as well as various communication protocols out of the

352
A.H. Moin
same model. The code generators are developed once, but work for as many
times as one needs to generate the implementation out of a model. Furthermore,
since the modeling languages use the terms, concepts and rules of the problem
domain instead of software development (i.e., the solution domain’s) terms, con-
cepts and rules, the communication among stakeholders will be deﬁnitely much
easier, comparing using general purpose modeling or programming languages.
Last but not least, to cope with the fast pace of technological advances, one
needs to maintain the code generators over time to adapt the old ones or create
new ones that can generate the implementation for new platforms, protocols,
etc. As mentioned, DSM creation tools give full control to their users over their
modeling languages and code generators in order to adapt them to their evolving
needs. This latter feature is also a property of MDA and MDSD.
Complete and automated code generation is possible in DSM mainly because
of two reasons. First, because DSM is speciﬁc to a very narrow problem domain.
For instance, the automotive domain is too broad as a domain in DSM, whereas
the infotainment system of a particular car manufacturer could be a proper can-
didate to be a domain in DSM. Second, because unlike in the CASE tools of the
1980 s and the 1990s (and many other existing ones in the present time), meta-
modeling tools (e.g., the free open source Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF))
which are used to create DSM solutions let their users have full control over their
modeling languages as well as code generators, whereas in CASE tools both were
hardcoded (i.e., ﬁxed) by the tool vendors in advance. Hence, in DSM’s view,
there is no one-size-ﬁts-all solution. Instead, every organization should come up
with its own solution either by developing it from scratch or by tailoring an
existing one (if it is publicly available) to its needs. Moreover, as time goes on,
due to changes in the requirements, business logic, technologies, etc. one needs
to maintain and adapt the DSM solution [12].
However, not all organizations can aﬀord the cost of building their own DSM
solution from scratch. One option would be to reuse a free open source one, if
there is any in the exact particular narrow target domain, and tailor it to one’s
needs. But, this is not really a realistic option, since those companies who own
a good DSM solution consider it as their key asset. Therefore, they often do not
disclose it. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to address this issue. We argue
that it actually makes sense for the owners of a DSM solution in a domain to
provide their DSM solution as a service, following the well known Software as
a Service (SaaS) model (more speciﬁcally Development as a Service, IDE as a
Service and Modeling tool as a Service), to the interested customers through the
IoTS. This will not only help the customer of the DSM solution save costs, but
will also let the DSM solution owner make money out of it. Moreover, comparing
traditional DSM solutions (i.e., non-SaaS), this will be much easier to use (no
need for installation, conﬁguration, etc.) and also more friendly to collaboration
via model repositories, since everything is basically stored on the cloud.
However, the key point here is that if the provided DSM solution service
does not allow its users to access the modeling languages or change the code
generators in order to adapt them to their needs, then we are, unfortunately,
www.ebook3000.com

Domain Speciﬁc Modeling (DSM) as a Service
353
back to the traditional CASE tools, where the modeling languages and code
generators were hardcoded (i.e., ﬁxed) by tool vendors. It is clear that such a
tool can support complete and fully automated code generation only in very rare
cases, where the narrow application domains have 100 % overlap with each other.
Therefore, in order to make the service more valuable and useful to a broader
range of audience, the service must at least allow the users to write new code
generators of their own on demand. Of course, this requires having (read) access
to the metamodel of the modeling language.
This way, users may either use the DSM solution, as it is, as a service, or they
could write their own code generators and may still use some of the provided
ones as services. Moreover, one could compose these services from diﬀerent DSM
solution service providers. In any case, the service provider does not have to
disclose the source code of the code generators.

Related Work
The general concept of providing software that is used for creating other soft-
ware as a service on the cloud already exists in a number of web-based tools
ranging from web-based IDEs such as the Cloud9 IDE1, Arvue2, etc. to various
web-based tools for creating composite SOA applications, web-based mashup
development tools, etc. Similarly, the idea is recently also proposed for Model-
Driven Engineering (MDE) tools, e.g., (data) Model as a Service (MaaS)3 or
(software) modeling as a service (a.k.a. MDE in the cloud)4. Most recently, the
idea is also applied to DSM creation tools [13]. The essential diﬀerence of this
contribution with our proposed approach is that our work is about the DSM
solutions that have been created via a DSM creation tool for particular nar-
row domains, e.g., SCC applications in the IoTS. However, their work is about
providing the DSM creation tool itself as a service for creating DSM solutions.

Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we proposed a novel approach for developing Sense-Compute-
Control (SCC) applications for the Internet of Things and Services (IoTS) based
on the Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) methodology, a paradigm
in software engineering for dealing with complexity. First, we brieﬂy reviewed
the three main recent approaches to MDSE. Second, according to the challenges
and requirements for developing SCC applications for the IoTS, we advocated
Domain Speciﬁc Modeling (DSM) among the MDSE approaches. Finally, we
proposed the idea of providing the DSM solutions as services through the IoTS.
Implementation and validation of the proposed ideas remained as future work.

Abstract. Cloud service composition is usually long term based and economi-
cally driven. Services in cloud computing can be categorized into two groups:
Application services and Computing Services. Compositions in the application
level are similar to the Web service compositions in Service-Oriented Computing.
Compositions in the computing level are similar to the task matching and
scheduling in grid computing. We consider cloud service composition from end
users perspective. We propose Genetic Algorithm-based approach to model the
cloud service composition problem. A comparison is given between the proposed
composition approach and other existing algorithms such as Integer Linear
Programming. The experiment results proved the efﬁciency of the proposed
approach.

Introduction
Cloud computing is emerging as the new paradigm for the next-generation distributed
computing. Big companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google and IBM are already
offering cloud computing solutions in the market. A fast increasing number of orga-
nizations are already outsourcing their business tasks to the cloud, instead of deploying
their own local infrastructures [1]. A signiﬁcant advantage of cloud computing is its
economic beneﬁts for end users and service providers.
Services in cloud computing can be categorized into application services and
computing services [2]. Almost all the software/applications that are available through
the Internet are application services, e.g., ﬂight booking services. Computing services

are software or virtualized hardware that supports application services, e.g., virtual
machines, CPU services and storage services. Service compositions in cloud computing
include compositions of application services and computing services. Compositions in
the application level are similar to the Web service compositions in SOC. Composi-
tions in the computing level are similar to the task matching and scheduling in grid
computing. Cloud service composition is usually long-term based and economically
driven. Traditional QoS (Quality of Service)-based composition techniques usually
consider the qualities at the time of the composition [3]. This is fundamentally different
in cloud environments where the cloud service composition should last for a long
period.
In this paper, a genetic-algorithm-based cloud service composition approach is
proposed. We focus on the selection of composition plans based solely on non-functional
or QoS attributes. The comparisons between the proposed approach and other existing
ones show the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the proposed approach. The rest of the
paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 illustrates the preliminaries of service composition
in cloud computing. Section 3 provides an overview of cloud service composition
problem. Section 4 highlights the related work of the cloud service composition models.
Section 5 describes in details the proposed composition approach. Section 6 tests and
evaluates the proposed approach and presents the experiment results. Section 7 draws a
conclusion and highlights the future work.

Preliminaries
In this section we present basic knowledge about cloud computing, service composi-
tions in cloud computing and QoS model.
2.1
Cloud Computing System
Cloud computing provides two types of services, application and computing services.
Application services are the most visible services to the end users (i.e. Google Apps),
Cloud systems provide these services to the end users through the software providers in
SaaS (Software as a Service) layer. Computing services are the hardware and system
software in the datacenters that provide those services [2] see Fig. 1.
Some vendors use terms such as PaaS (Platforms a Service) or IaaS (Infrastructure
as a Service) to describe their products. In this paper, PaaS and IaaS are considered
together as Computing Services. PaaS are platforms that are used to develop, test,
deploy and monitor application services. For example, Google has Google App Engine
that works as the platform to develop, deploy and maintain Google Apps. IaaS services
provide fundamental computing resources, which can be used to construct new plat-
form services or application services. Computing Services include computation ser-
vices, i.e., Virtual Machines (VMs); storage services, i.e., Databases; and network
services. Computing Services Vendors are these companies or organizations that make
their computing resources available to the public such as Amazon EC2.

2.2
Service Composition in Cloud Computing
A composite service is speciﬁed as a collection of abstract application services
according to a combination of control-ﬂow and data-ﬂow. Similar to traditional service
composition, cloud service composition is conducted in two steps. First, a composition
schema is constructed for a composition request. Second, the optimal composition plan
is selected. Control-ﬂow graphs are represented using UML activity diagrams. Each
node in the graph is an abstract application service. There are four control-ﬂow patterns
for deﬁning a composite cloud service (composition schema), such as sequential,
parallel, conditional and iterative (loop) patterns [8] (Fig. 2). Directed acyclic graphs
(DAGs) are used to represent composition schema.
Any solution to a composition problem in cloud computing includes: (1) Map the
abstract application services to concrete application services and corresponding com-
pute service (VM, database and network services). (2) Schedule the execution order of
the application services. In this research we introduce only the selection of the com-
position plan (abstract application services) based solely on user’s QoS attributes.
2.3
QoS Model
QoS-based cloud service selection is a critical process that directly determines the QoS
values of the composite cloud service. The ultimate goal of the selection process is to

ﬁnd the best composition plan for the composite cloud service that provides the optimal
choice to the end user. We use a QoS model that is applicable to all the SaaS and IaaS.
2.3.1
QoS Model for Elementary Services
We consider the three major QoS attributes which are: cost, response time, and
throughput.
Cost: the amount of money that the end user has to pay to the service provider for using
a cloud service S, it is denoted as Qcost S
ð Þ. For SaaS provider, it is the execution cost
for using a single request SaaS, for IaaS provider it is the computation cost for using a
unit IaaS for one second.
Response time: the time interval of a cloud service S from request to response, it is
denoted as Qresp S
ð Þ. For SaaS provider SP, response time is the expected delay in
seconds between the moment when a request is sent and the moment when the results
are received. For IaaS provider IP, the response time is the number of CPU (network,
storage) units used for processing a computation (data transfer, storage) request.
Throughput: the rate at which a cloud service S can process requests, it is denoted as
Qth S
ð Þ. For SaaS provider SP, the throughput is the number of requests the SaaS
provider is able to process per second. For IaaS provider IP, the service rate is the
number of CPU (network, storage) requests IaaS provider is able to process per sec.
2.3.2
QoS Model for Composite Services
In addition to the QoS attributes of each individual service, the composition pattern and
corresponding aggregate functions should be also considered. The overall QoS can be
deﬁned as shown in Eq. 1.

System Model
In this section, we highlight the service composition model, the problem formulation,
and the cloud service composition problem.
3.1
Cloud Service Composition Model
The service composition model introduced in this paper is similar to the one given
in [6]. In this model we identify four components: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
Providers, SaaS (Software as a Service) Providers, Composer and End users, see Fig. 3.
Platform as a Service (PaaS) layer is omitted because we assume that this layer is
included in the IaaS layer. The IaaS Providers supply IaaS, i.e., CPU services, storage
services, and network services, to SaaS providers and end users. The SaaS providers
supply SaaS to end users. The end users are usually large companies and organizations,
e.g., universities, governments. The Composer is the proposed composition model that
acts on behaves of the end users to form composite services that contain services from
multiple SaaS providers and IaaS providers. The main functions of composer are: (1)
construct composition schema. (2) Select optimal composition plan. Since the main
concern in this research is the selection of optimal composition plan based solely on
user’s preferences (QoS attributes). We assume that existing composition techniques
such as the one introduced in [7] to generate composition schema.
3.2
Problem Formulation
This section introduces the cloud service composition problem as follow:
Given
1. A set of abstract cloud services (or tasks) T involved in a cloud service composition,
where T = {T1,T2, …..,Tn} and n is the total number of abstract cloud services in the
composition.
Fig. 3. The proposed composition model

359

2. For task Ti, a set of Ki candidate SaaS providers can be used to implement the task,
SPi = f SPið1Þ; SPið2Þ; : : : ; SPiðKiÞg . A set of Pp candidate IaaS providers sup-
ply IaaS to composite services: SP0 = f SP0ð1Þ; SP0ð2Þ; : : : ; SP0ðPpÞg
3. A candidate composition plan (denoted as Plan ½fSP0 K0
ð
Þ; SP1 K1
ð
Þ; SP2 K2
ð
Þ : : :

ð
Þg is formed by selecting certain SaaS providers and IaaS providers for the
end user.
4. In the composition plan, the composite service is supported by the IaaS provider
SP0 K0
ð
Þ. Task Ti is implemented by SaaS provider SPi(Ki).
5. We assume sequential composition pattern is used for composition and user’s QoS
attributes are numbered from 1 to 3, with 1 = cost, 2 = response time and
3 = throughput. The QoS values for a composition plan using the aggregation
functions stated above is denoted as: QoStotal(plan) = [Q(1), Q(2),Q(3)]
6. Since Service composition in cloud is long-term based economically driven user’s
QoS requirement, The end users would have different QoS requirements (cost,
response time, throughput) on the composite service during long period, i.e., the end
user may prefer composite service that has less cost, while in another period the end
user may ﬁnd that the cost is less important than decreasing the response time as
much as possible.
The Composite Cloud Service (CCS) is the problem whose goal is to choose one or
more composition plan (execution plan) that have a good performance on most of the
QoS factors and meet user requirements. [19] The CCS problem based on multiple QoS
criteria is a combinational optimization problem that is known to be an NP-Hard [12].
The solution to this problem should optimize (minimize/ maximize) the components of
the vector QoStotal(plan).
When the composition system makes decisions on which concrete SaaS providers
and IaaS providers should be selected for the end user, it has no idea about how will the
ultimate composite service behave during a long period. To enable long-term cloud
service composition, economic models are needed to predict the long-term preferences
of the end users. An economic model is deﬁned as “a theoretical construct that rep-
resents economic processes by a set of variables and a set of logical and quantitative
relationships between them”. [9].
The ﬁnal objective is to ﬁnd a fully cloud service composition that minimizes the
cost and time, and improves the throughput. We model the cloud service composition
problem as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP).

Cloud Service Composition Optimization Problem
In this problem, we consider the three user objectives, the lowest cost, the shortest
response time, and the highest throughput. This makes it infeasible to ﬁnd an optimal
composition as these objectives can conﬂict with each other. One way to address this
problem is to convert the composition problem to a single-objective problem by asking
users to give weights to each objective. The end user presents these preferences through
a Score Function [3]. We denote the QoS requirements of the end user as: Wa tð Þ ¼
½w1 ðtÞ; w2 ðtÞ; w3 ðtÞ , where Wa(t) denotes the weight of QoS attribute (a) for the
composite service at period t. Each composition plan is associated with a score from the

end user’s perspective. A commonly used score function is the weighted sum of QoS
values of the composite service. The main objective is to ﬁnd an optimal composition
plan S (plan) that provides the maximum score value.

Service composition problem can be categorized into two groups. One group focuses
on the functional composition among component services. The other group aims to
make optimal decisions to select the best Component services based on non-functional
properties (QoS).
Functional-driven service composition approaches typically adopt semantic
descriptions of services. Examples of automatic approaches include Policy-based
approach proposed by [14]. Other functional-driven composition approaches use AI
planning methods. Most of them [15] assume that each service is an action which alters
the state of the world as a result of its execution. The inputs and outputs parameters of a
service act as preconditions and effects in the planning context. Users only need to
specify the inputs and the outputs of the desired composite service, a plan (or a
composite service) would automatically generated by the AI planners. Different users
may have different requirements and preferences regarding QoS. Therefore, QoS-aware
composition approaches are needed. QoS-aware service composition problem is usu-
ally modeled as a Multiple Criteria Decision Making [3] problem. The most popular
approaches include integer linear programming and genetic algorithms. An Integer
Linear Program (ILP) consists of a set of variables, a set of linear constraints and a
linear objective function. After having translated the composition problem into this
formalism, Speciﬁc solver software such as LPSolve [13] can be used. References
[16, 17] use Genetic Algorithms (GA) for service composition.
Most of the existing composition approaches are not well suited for cloud envi-
ronment [17]. They usually consider the qualities at the time of the composition [4].
The proposed composition approach considers the problem from a long-term
perspective.

Genetic Algorithm – Based Approach
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) [12] are heuristic approaches that iteratively ﬁnd the nearest
optimal solution in large search solutions. Any possible solution to the optimization
problem is encoded as a Chromosome (genome). A set of chromosomes is referred to
as a Population. The ﬁrst step of a GA is to derive an initial population. A random set
of chromosomes is often used as the initial population. This initial population is the ﬁrst
generation from which the evolution starts. The second step is the selection process,
each chromosome is eliminated or duplicated (one or more times) based on its relative
quality. The population size is typically kept constant. The next step is the Crossover
QoS Optimization for Cloud Service Composition Based on Economic Model
361

process. Some pairs of chromosomes are selected from the current population and some
of their corresponding components are exchanged to form two valid chromosome.
After crossover, each chromosome in the population may be mutated with some
probability. The mutation process transforms a chromosome into another valid one.
The new population is then evaluated and each chromosome is associated with a ﬁtness
value, which is a value obtained from the objective function. The objective of the
evaluation is to ﬁnd a chromosome that has the optimal ﬁtness value. If the stopping
criterion is not met, the new population goes through another cycle (iteration) of
selection, crossover, mutation, and evaluation. These cycles continue until the stopping
criterion is met [4].
5.1
Algorithm Implementation
The Proposed Approach Consists of the Following Process:
1. Deﬁne Chromosome: For genetic algorithms, one of the key issues is to encode a
solution of the -problem into a chromosome (individual). In our model, the chro-
mosome is encoded by an integer array with a number of items equals to the number
of distinct abstract services that compose our service. Each item, in turn, contains an
index to the array of the concrete services matching that abstract service.
2. Generate Initial Population: a predeﬁned number of chromosomes are generated
to form the initial generation. The chromosome in a generation is ﬁrst ordered by
their ﬁtness values from the best to worst.
3. Apply Genetic Operator: To apply this process we deﬁne the operator of each step
as following:
• Selection Operator: We use the binary tournament selection as the selection
operator. The binary tournament selection runs a tournament between two
individuals and selects the winner. In this way, the individuals that formed
the next generation are determined. The population size of each generation is
always P.
• Crossover Operator: We use the single-point crossover as the crossover
operator. The crossover point is a random value from 1 to Nt (the number of
genes in one chromosome).
• Mutation Operator: We randomly select an abstract service and randomly
replace the corresponding concrete service with another one among those
available. Clearly, we select the abstract service for which only one concrete
service is available.
4. Evaluate the Chromosomes Using Fitness Function: The ﬁtness function should
maximize some QoS attributes (i.e. throughput), minimize some other attributes (i.e.
cost and response time). In addition, the ﬁtness function must penalize solutions that
do not meet the QoS constraints and drive the evolution towards constraints sat-
isfaction. Let us suppose that the composite service has a set of constraints deﬁned
as QC [10]. we deﬁne D(c), the distance from the constraint satisfaction of a
chromosome (solution) c, as following :
362

D(c) =
Xl
i¼1QCi c
ð Þ  ei  weighti; ei =
0QCiðcÞ  0
1QCiðcÞ [ 0


ð3Þ
where,
– weighti indicates the weight of the QoS constraint.
– l is number of constraints that composite service has for a speciﬁc chromosome
(solution) c.
The ﬁtness function for a chromosome c is then deﬁned as:
F c
ð Þ ¼
X
a
i¼1
wi  Qi c
ð Þ þ weightp  DðcÞ
ð4Þ
where,
– wi is the weight corresponding to each QoS attribute i.
– weightp is the penalty factor.
– A is number of Qos attributes which is 3 in our case.
The stop criterions of the proposed approach are:
(1) Iterate until the constraints are met (i.e. D(c) = 0).
(2) If this does not happen within a deﬁned maximum number of generation,
‘MAXGEN’, then iterate until the best ﬁtness value remains unchanged for a given
number ‘MAXGEN’ of generations.
(3) If neither (1) nor (2) happened within ‘MAXGEN’ generations, then no solution
will be returned.

Experiments and Evaluation
We run our experiments on a Dell laptop with 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 6G
Ram under Windows 7 operating system. We have used Jmetal [11] which is Java
framework for implementing multi-objective and single-objective algorithms. We
implement the Genetic Algorithm-based approach in this framework that allows us to
deﬁne each problem by deﬁning each chromosome (variable) to point to a cloud service
candidate. After that, we deﬁne the ﬁtness functions for all deﬁned objectives and
choose the algorithm that solves the problem. We ﬁrst conduct one experiment to show
the effect of changing available concrete services for each abstract service on the
execution time, Fig. 4 shows that the execution time increases quickly at the beginning
of the experiment, but it keeps nearly constant when the number of concrete services
for each abstract service becomes larger than 200. We conduct the experiment that
shows the effect of selection operator on reaching to the optimal ﬁtness value. Figure 5
shows the comparison between the tournament selection operator used in the proposed
approach and the random selection operator. As shown in Fig. 5, the proposed
approach will always reach an optimized ﬁtness value while random selection seldom
QoS Optimization for Cloud Service Composition Based on Economic Model
363

converges. The proposed GA based approach will always reach an optimal ﬁtness value
and the converged point becomes very close to the actual optimal point. We conduct a
comparison experiment with another approach such Integer Programming. The Integer
Programming (IP) approaches have been proposed to solve QoS-aware service com-
position. The IP approaches implemented using LPSolve [13], which is an open source
integer programming system. Figure 6 shows that the IP approach performs as good as

the GA based approach at the beginning. Notice that, when the number of abstract
services becomes more than 40, the execution time cost of the IP approaches will
increase exponentially to solve composition problems.

Conclusions and Future Work
This paper discusses the cloud service composition problem as multi-objective opti-
mization to satisfy the requirements of user’s QoS requirements and presents an
approach to solve the multi-objective problem by converting it to a single objective
problem. We have proposed an approach that uses the Genetic Algorithm to solve this
problem. The experiment results proved the efﬁciency of the proposed approach.
For the future work, we intend to solve the multi-objective composition problem
using multi-objective algorithms such NSGA II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
Algorithm), SPEA-II (Strength Pareto Evolution Algorithm) [20] and other meta-
heuristics algorithm which is based on swarm intelligence such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (OMOPSO) [21] and compare the efﬁciency of these algorithms.

Abstract. Smart mobile phones are vital to the Mobile Cloud Comput-
ing (MCC) paradigm where compute jobs can be oﬄoaded to the devices
from the Cloud and vice-versa, or the devices can act as peers to collab-
oratively perform a task. Recent research in IoT context also points to
the use of smartphones as sensor gateways highlighting the importance of
data processing at the network edge. In either case, when a smart phone
is used as a compute resource or a sensor gateway, the corresponding
tasks must be executed in addition to the user’s normal activities on the
device without aﬀecting the user experience. In this paper, we propose
a framework that can act as an enabler of such features by classifying
the availability of system resources like CPU, memory, network usage
based on applications running on an Android phone. We show that, such
app-based classiﬁcations are user-speciﬁc and app usage varies with dif-
ferent handsets, leading to diﬀerent classiﬁcations. We further show that
irrespective of such variation in classiﬁcation, distinct patterns exist for
all users with available opportunity to schedule external tasks, without
aﬀecting user experience. Based on the next to-be-used applications, we
output a predicted set of system resources. The resource levels along with
handset architecture may be used to estimate worst case execution time
for external jobs.

Introduction
With the advancement of technology more people are using high end mobile
phones with increased hardware capabilities. Though such phones are being used
for functionalities more than just communication, they remain idle for major-
ity of the time. One of the focus areas of Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC)
is to explore possibilities of utilizing mobile phones as compute resources to
augment the Cloud infrastructure. In [1], jobs are executed on mobile phones
using a map-reduce framework. Authors in [2,3] propose oﬄoading jobs between
mobiles where the phones act as compute peers. More recently, in the context of
Internet of Things (IoT), the idea of edge devices being used to precess data at

the network edge was introduced in Fog Computing [4] and the present authors
have implemented a preliminary prototype which is outlined in [5]. The authors
believe that in a smart city scenario, with numerous sensors and edge devices
emitting highly ﬂuctuating volume of data, an MCC framework augmenting the
cloud may indeed be useful. Recent works by McCann et al. have also pointed
towards the use of personal devices as sensor gateways and data-forwarding
entities [6,7]. We are of the belief that during such phases, the devices may
also be utilised for small amounts of computation in order to reduce the cost
incurred in pushing the data to the cloud and in turn save energy (as apart from
incurring a communication cost, any network transfer is energy intense). How-
ever, to eﬀectively schedule jobs on available phones and other edge devices, the
cloud servers would require an estimation of available cpu, memory and other
parameters for those devices as the execution time of an externally assigned com-
putation will vary depending on the foreground(user) and background activities
running on the phone. The same is true if the devices are used as sensor gate-
ways. This implies that the user experience must not get aﬀected while executing
the assigned job or transfering sensor data to the cloud. In other words, it can
be said that the user experience is not aﬀected if such tasks are scheduled at
the right time, when the device is relatively idle. Figure 1 explains the context
described herein.

A number of studies have attempted to classify android applications based
on android package details, power consumption and static code analysis. Com-
mercial and free benchmark tools have also been used to measure relative per-
formance of a handset and proﬁle apps. The diversity of smartphone app usage
behavior among users was highlighted in [8,9]. These approaches showed that
unique usage patterns exist, albeit on a per user basis. With this idea of user
speciﬁc patterns, we propose to predict system resources inﬂuencing the per-
formance of an android mobile, based on the currently running android apps,
per user.
Our work focuses on analyzing the CPU, memory etc. resource usage, when
apps are running on the devices to detect phases when the system resources are
relatively free for external job execution. We classify CPU and RAM based on
android apps used on a handset by the user of the handset by analysing the log
containing running apps snapshots, overall idle CPU time, available memory etc.

externally assigned task. We also show the variation of the classiﬁcation results
with user and handset and present the result of our ﬁeld-study showing the cor-
relation of our prediction with benchmark scores from a well known benchmark
tool, AndEbench [10].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We analyze the previous
work done in android app classiﬁcation and android benchmarking in Sect. 2.
In Sect. 3, we describe our approach regarding data collection, preprocessing,
feature selection classiﬁer selection and ﬁeld study. We present the results in
Sect. 4 and conclude with a summary of the contributions and some pointers for
future work.

Related Work
Not many systems exist for classifying smart-phone system resources based on
app usage. A number of research works have focused on classifying android apps
based on android package details, power consumption and static code analysis.
The main focus of such analysis is to segregate apps from malwares. Several
commercial tools benchmark system resources at both app and handset levels.
Zeﬀerer et al. [11] presented a scheme of malware detection by classifying
android apps based on power consumption. They found that the power-
consumption signature for a given application or phone state could not be deter-
mined uniquely and the signature for the same app was analogous to wide pitch
and frequency variance of the diﬀerent speech records from the same person.
Sanz et al. [12] developed a new app classiﬁcation scheme using extracted fea-
tures from said app and the Android Market. They worked with a large set
of 820 apps categorizing them into seven categories by using classiﬁcation tech-
niques and providing a comparative evaluation using the Area Under ROC Curve
(AUC). Shabtai et al. [13] focussed on app classiﬁcation using framework meth-
ods and classes used by the app, user interface widgets etc. and identiﬁed the
optimum combination for feature selection method, top features selected and the
classiﬁer.
Several commercial tools are available for benchmarking. Notable among
these is the Trepn Proﬁler [14] from Qualcomm which provides system or app
speciﬁc cpu proﬁling. AndEBench is another tool that we used extensively in
this work and it shows a native and java score for each phone. However, none
of the benchmark tools however categorize apps based on the system resource
usage or provide a relative scoring for each app. Our work aims to classify system
resources based on android apps per user per phone, leveraging the unique usage
pattern.

Approach
A logging application for android devices was deployed on the mobile phones of
several users which was used to gather data over a period of two weeks for each
user. This application gathers last app, last service component, data transfer

and memory available using android APIs. For system CPU usage and process
details, the system parses the top command output which outputs processes like
system server, uevent and several other system activities that are not available
using android APIs. As the logger logs data in a very precise form, with only
the required values for our analysis, the log ﬁle size (at most 2MB in two weeks)
is never a concern for the volunteers.
To determine the cpu availability, we used the jiﬀy values from android top
output and calculated the percentage of time the cpu was idle. For the two
class classiﬁcation (in this case, high and low), we applied k-means clustering
technique [15] on the idle cpu percentage values. For multiprocessor systems, top
provides a measure of summation over (number of cores x percentage utilized in
each core). We scaled the overall value for all cores by dividing it by the number
of cores for that phone System On Chip (SoC). We collected available memory
information using the getMemoryInfo API of android ActivityManager and the
system memory information from /proc/meminfo. An equally weighted average
of the two values was used to express the memory free percentage. Similar to
the cpu values, k-means clustering was applied on the free memory percentage
values, to create two clusters high and low.
One pertinent note at this point may be that - out of a myriad of available
android applications (as per [16] the latest number is 1175286) we are classifying
on the basis of only a small subset. To justify our approach, it may be said that
as we apply our system on a per user basis, the applications usually running
on the phone of the user determines the classiﬁcation of system resources. The
analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the ranker algorithm
also proves that only a subset of all the apps installed in a phone have any
visible eﬀect on the resources as is shown in Table 1, which lists the top-6 ranked
features for two diﬀerent users using two diﬀerent handsets.

We used machine learning concepts to depict the dependency between appli-
cation running in a phone and the level of the available system resources. How-
ever, we haven’t yet implemented a full-ﬂedged online app prediction system and
rather have taken cues from [17] to create a Na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁcation of oﬄine
data from the mobile phones on which we evaluated the current system. We built
a prediction model using the WEKA [18] tool and evaluated using test data for

top four apps being used in the system, during a 5 second interval. To evaluate
our system on real mobile phones we used the Weka-for-Android [19] implemen-
tation for the Na¨ıve bayes classiﬁer along with the oﬄine model created for that
phone using desktop WEKA. With the next four running app prediction at hand
along with all other features required for system resource classiﬁcation, we used
a modiﬁcation of the LibSVM-androjni [20] project to run our Logistic Regres-
sion classiﬁer. We chose the Logistic Regression classiﬁer for the ﬁeld study as an
android port was easily available and it performed reasonably well, as detailed
in the Sect. 4. We mapped the output of the classiﬁer (system resource level high
or low) to our ﬁnal decision - to run or not to run the external task.
As the MCC frameworks ANGELS [5] is still under development, we decided
to use a diﬀerent innovative measure to evaluate the output. We designed a set
of experiments (a snapshot of which is given in Fig. 2a) to obtain a correlation
between the AndEBench score and the underlying activities. In each experiment,

the sanitize step kills user processes, cleans the cache from task manager, starts
AndEBench, performs test scenarios and ﬁnally records the scores. We observed
this and triggered a run of AndEBench, based on recommendation output from
the system resource classiﬁer. As a single AndEBench run takes around one
minute, we kept the prediction cycles separated by ﬁve minutes for evaluation.
Our aim was to correlate the prediction of system resource level for the next
cycle to the score from AndEBench in the next cycle. For a high level for system
resource prediction, if the score of AndEBench is also high, we considered the
prediction to be accurate. The apparent correlation between the benchmark
score and underlying activities for a snapshot of the experiments is shown in
Fig. 2b and c.

Results
We used two sets of comparisons to diﬀerentiate the classiﬁers the area under
the ROC curve (AUC), as recommended in several literatures including [21]
and traditional error rate based measure as suggested in [22]. We included the
latter keeping in mind the drawbacks of AUC, highlighted in [23]. The results
are shown in Tables 2a and b1 from where it can be seen that as per the AUC
measure Logistic Regression and Random Forest performed best for both the

phones. On the other hand, based on the error rate measure Random Forest
and SVM gave better results than all other classiﬁers for A110q phone. For the
Xperia L phone Random Forest, SVM and Logistic Regression performed well.
During the classiﬁcation eﬀort, we also observed from the training data that the
system resource availability level is high 81 % of time in the A110q phone and
82 % of the time in Xperia L phone. Thus we are able to observe distinct patterns
(from classiﬁcation accuracy) for both the users with available opportunity to
schedule external jobs, without aﬀecting user experience.
As stated before in Sect. 3, we triggered a run of AndEBench after a 5 min
interval based on the recommendation from our system resource prediction sys-
tem. The actual run happens only when the system resources are classiﬁed as
high. We present a snapshot run in Fig. 3a to depict the correctness of recommen-
dations. We also proﬁled our own app using the Trepn proﬁler [14] and the result
is given in Fig. 3b which shows a fairly good performance measure, although we

Conclusion
In this work we have addressed the issue of predicting the available system
resources in the face of a set of apps to be executed. We have applied Logis-
tic regression to classify the availability of resources. We have further showed
that the resultant classiﬁcation correlates with the scores from a well known
benchmark tool. The major contribution of the work is the demonstration of the
eﬃcacy of the classiﬁcation approach to predict the resource availability. This
can be fruitfully employed while selecting mobile phones where MCC based jobs
can be executed in a smart city context. As a sidebar of this research we have
also found that android system and background tasks are particularly useful in
predicting the resource availability and those can be predicted using data from
android phones and past execution history of such tasks.

Abstract. This paper investigates how low-cost embedded systems can
be tailored to support the interaction between users with disabilities and
computers. The main idea is to implement several software solutions for
assistive technology to deploy on the user embedded device. When such
a device is connected to a whichever computing system (e.g. through an
USB connection), it acts as HID (Human Interface Device) peripheral
(e.g., mouse and keyboard), so that the user can work on the computer
without any previous conﬁguration setup to adapt the behavior of the
computing system to the user disability. The proposed solution exploits
Cloud-based services to adapt the device ﬁrmware to the user’s needs and
preferences. To test the whole system, we discuss the design of an alter-
native input device based on MEMS accelerometers and the Atmega32u4
microcontroller and it is currently intended for individuals with motor
disabilities.

Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to interconnect everything into the Inter-
net, from daily life devices to more complex networked systems exploiting global
network infrastructures, linking physical and virtual objects, using Cloud com-
puting resources, processing sensor data, and adopting advances communication
technologies [2]. Here we consider IoT equipments based on programmable low-
cost embedded systems and microcontroller boards which are currently available
on the market. Some of these devices (e.g., the Raspberry Pi) come with a tai-
lored Linux operating system able to execute pieces of software implemented in a
high-level programming language (such as Python or Java). Generally, they also
have an integrated network connection to access the Internet and exchange data
with external smart objects. A classic deployment of these embedded devices
implies that they manage heterogeneous wireless sensor networks and process
data over the Cloud. Multiple application scenarios can be imagined for this
approach [3,9]. This paper discusses a diﬀerent approach to exploit Cloud com-
puting for IoT purposes. It focuses the attention on how such IoT devices are able

to interface a generic computer and to act as alternative input devices. Speciﬁ-
cally, we discuss how a microcontroller board can support external sensors and
peripherals in order to work as Human Computer Interface (HCI).
Typically, disable users interacts with a computing environment by means
of personalized Assistive Technology (AT) hardware and software solutions. For
example, users with motor disabilities cannot use standard keyboards or mouses
and rely on alternative input devices (e.g., joysticks, switches, special keyboards,
voice recognition systems) and mouse emulation software. Similarly, people with
low vision work using screen reader programs to manage a Personal Computer
(PC), or executing screen magniﬁcation pieces of software in order to better
navigate a visual interface. Regardless the type of used AT equipment, such an
equipment requires a speciﬁc conﬁguration process in order to accomplish the
end user’s needs. This task has to be performed by an AT expert, who works
close to the person with the disability in order to properly adapt the computing
environment to its user. The conﬁguration task has to be carried out on any user
PC, and it can become an hard task on speciﬁc system, such as in an Internet
point or in a laboratory, where the user cannot install tailored pieces of software
or drivers. In general, a very diﬃcult situation occurs every time an user has
to work on a computing environment that does not support his/her personal
assistive solutions.
To address the aforementioned issues, we suggest to provide the end user with
a smart AT hardware device, that is an IoT embedded system able to interface
the user with any computer without any installation of drivers or speciﬁc appli-
cations. To this aim, the device includes a speciﬁc ﬁrmware to interface sensors
and other AT standard devices (e.g., reduced keyboard or special mouse), con-
verting the produced input data into native input command for a computer.
Therefore, if the disable user is usual to work with speciﬁc AT tools (e.g., voice
recognition application, webcam-based eye tracker), our solution allows him to
use the same AT equipment to interact with diﬀerent computing devices, such
as PCs or smartphones. Such embedded system has a built-in wireless network
interface and its functionalities can be customized using a Cloud-based service.
This is an important feature, since a remote AT expert may support a user by
updating the ﬁrmware on the embedded HCI platform he/she is going to use to
access a computer.
The aforementioned setup process needs to be performed only once and it will
make accessible any computer able to interact with the HCI system. To show a
concrete adoption of an HCI, in the next sections we discuss the development of
a prototype, based on a tri-axial accelerometer, working as mouse emulator for
computer users with motor disabilities. The device has an Atmega32u4 micron-
troller with an USB device connection, while we use a diﬀerent processor to run
our software controller on a Linux embedded operating system.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the archi-
tecture of the proposed HCI prototype and describes the conﬁguration process
based on Cloud services. Related works in the ﬁeld of AT are presented in Sect. 3.
Finally, conclusion and future works are summarized in Sect. 4.

HCI System Description
The proposed human computer interface consists of two key components. First,
an Atmega32u4 microcontroller is required to appear as a native mouse (or
keyboard) when the device is attached to a generic computer with an USB host
port. More speciﬁcally, the same microcontroller executes a custom version of the
Arduino bootloader that supports the Mouse/Keyboard libraries. Another main
hardware component of our HCI system is a second processor allowing to boot a
Linux embedded operating system equipped with a Python runtime. Therefore
we use a standard Python high - level programming language to acquire and
to process data from external devices and sensors. Additionally, our embedded
system needs to manage a network connection to access the Internet and an USB
host port able to interface external peripherals.
To fulﬁll these conditions, currently our prototype is based on an Arduino
Yun board, a microcontroller board based on the Atmega32u4 and the Atheros
AR9331 procesor which supports a Linux distribution based on OpenWrt named
Linino. The board has built-in Ethernet and WiFi support, a USB host port,
micro-SD card slot, 20 digital input/output pins and a micro USB connection for
connecting a computer. Moreover, the YUN itself from other Arduino boards in
that it can communicate with the Linux distribution onboard, oﬀering a powerful
networked computer with the ease of Arduino. In addition to Linux commands
like cURL, the Atheros processor is able to execute shell and Python scripts for
robust interactions.
From a technical point of view, we have interfaced the Yun board with several
kinds of sensor node, available on the market. Each sensor node consists of
an accelerometer, a dedicated microcontroller, and an interface which enables
the communication with a computing device, like an embedded system. This
interface can be a wireless (bluetooth or zigbee) or wired. Sensor nodes can be
powered by using a coin cell battery or a rechargeable battery. So, these devices
are very small and non invasive; for example, they can easily be attached on the
head. Furthermore, this hardware solution does not impair the natural movement
of the body: examples of possible placements of the sensor nodes are given in
Figs. 1 and 2.
Here we focus on head movements, since the head is the highest body segment
and in consequence, the last aﬀected in spinal cord injury patients. Additionally,
many people are unable to use a standard computer mouse because of disabilities
aﬀecting their hands or arms. Head controls oﬀer one alternative by allowing
people to use head movements to control the computer cursor. Human head-
movements can be characterized in movements for any other two dimensional
device. By using an accelerometer attached on the head, we are able to detect
four kinds of movements, as described in the Fig. 3.
2.1
The Mouse Emulator
According to the proposed mouse emulator, the movements made with the hand
to move the mouse pointer are substituted by head movements. Speciﬁcally, up

and down vertical movement (pitch) is used for up down displacement while roll
movements are used for left right displacement. So the end user can fully control
a computer: for example, he/she can use an on-screen keyboard. Such a solution
provides also a novel interaction method for controlling a computing environment
through very intuitive body movements given that a sensor node can detect
measurement of inclination changes less than 1.0 ◦. This is a very important
feature which can be a key element for independence and autonomy of people
with disabilities: in these cases, enabling alternative and simple interaction with
a standard personal computer becomes critical for these kinds of users.
Moreover, our HCI system is based on signal processing algorithms which
enable to classify gestures: for these purpose we have marked two kinds of move-
ments: fast and slow. A slow gesture features low acceleration values and it can
be used for typical mouse pointer movement; a fast gesture features high accel-
eration values, so these signal peaks can perform click or double click events.
2.2
Conﬁguration Process
Considering the Arduino YUN environment, all the algorithms for interacting
with external sensors or devices have been implemented in Python. This also
allows us to create a system service to synchronize all the applications and their
options with a Cloud-based service. By using a simple web application running
on each Arduino boards, it is possible to conﬁgure all the parameters of AT
tools running on the board.These data are stored into a user proﬁle available on
a remote server. Such feature may allow a remote AT expert to support a user
with a disability by adjusting the ﬁrmware running on the embedded system
used by the person to access to a computer.

Related Works
AT can be viewed as technology used by individuals with disabilities in order to
perform functions that might otherwise be diﬃcult or impossible. AT can include
mobility devices such as walkers and wheelchairs, as well as hardware, software,
and peripherals that assist people with disabilities in accessing computers or
other information technologies [5].
In this ﬁeld, alternative input devices allow end users to control their comput-
ers through means other than a standard keyboard or pointing device. Examples
include [1]:
– Alternative keyboards featuring larger- or smaller-than-standard keys or key-
boards, alternative key conﬁgurations, and keyboards for use with one hand.
– Electronic pointing devicesused to control the cursor on the screen without use
of hands. Devices used include ultrasound, infrared beams, eye movements,
nerve signals, or brain waves.
– Sip-and-puﬀsystemsactivated by inhaling or exhaling.
– Wands and sticksworn on the head, held in the mouth or strapped to the chin
and used to press keys on the keyboard.

– Joysticks manipulated by hand, feet, chin, etc. and used to control the cursor

– Trackballs movable balls on top of a base that can be used to move the cursor

– Touch screens allow direct selection or activation of the computer by touching
the screen, making it easier to select an option directly rather than through
a mouse movement or keyboard. Touch screens are either built into the com-
puter monitor or can be added onto a computer monitor.
Several novel method for supporting the interaction between users with disabil-
ities and computers are available in literature [7]. In [4], the authors describe a
prototype based on RGB-D sensors able to support a multimodal human com-
puter interaction and to replace some existing AT solutions. A particular table-
top keyboard is discussed in [6], it is mainly designed for stroke patients. EMG
sensors can be used to design new types of HCI systems, as discussed in [10]. Also,
interesting studies about BCI (brain computer interface) are available in [8].

Conclusion
This paper dealt with the usage on embedded systems and IoT devices in order
to achieve alternative human-computer interfaces for users with disabilities. The
proposed solution exploits Cloud-based services to adjust its functions according
users’ needs and preferences. To demonstrate a possible usage of the HCI system,
a mouse emulator has been developed using an Arduino YUN with a MEMS
accelerometer sensor.

The next version of the HCI system discussed in this paper will be based
on the block diagram depicted in Fig. 4. Our software will relate recognized
gestures with speciﬁc commands required to control external devices; the low
cost sensor can detect a few of the movements, but they can ﬁt to use computers,
smartphones, televisions, cameras, robots, electric powered wheelchairs etc.
Also, the HCI will consist of three functional blocks:
– a signals reader collects acceleration readings;
– a gestures interpreter detects movements on the base of sensor values;
– a commands converter associates these recognized gestures with speciﬁc com-
mands needed to control many devices.
