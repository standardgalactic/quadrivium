About the Author
Randy Vance has been boating since he was 8 years old. From family boat to 
personal runabout at age 20, he’s bought and sold nearly a dozen boats in his 
boating career.
With his family, Randy ran a small resort and marina on Lake of the Ozarks in 
Missouri for more than 20 years. During that time, he was a popular outdoors 
columnist in local papers and magazines and hosted or appeared on many 
radio and television programs covering topics of boating and fi shing. Later, 
Randy began a public relations career at Bass Pro Shops, employing his 
enjoyment of boating, outdoors, and writing in one happy position. After a 
short stint at the failing Outboard Marine Corporation, Boating Life magazine 
publisher John McEver asked Randy to take the helm of his magazine — a 
position Randy has enjoyed with co-editors Robert Stephens and Sue Whitney 
since 2000. Boating Life magazine and some of Randy’s articles have won 
awards in many publishing circles.
During his tenure at Boating Life, Randy has had the pleasure of piloting 
thousands of boats in hundreds of different places and conditions. Mexico, 
the Exumas, Dry Tortugas, Alaska’s Admiralty Island, Sweden, and Bimini, 
Bahamas, are among his favorite boating destinations.
Randy, his wife Linda, and youngest daughter Amy, along with three 
champion Cotons du Tulear and a stray Jack Russell Terrier, enjoy a 25-foot 
Bluewater offshore boat with twin Evinrude outboards. Most often you’ll fi nd 
him offshore at Cape Canaveral or just outside of Springhill, Florida, or Punta 
Gorda, Florida.
Randy and his daughter Amy are in the midst of the long and arduous 
process of researching his next book Restoring Old Boats For Dummies. . . just 
joking; they’re attempting to bring a 1978 Glastron GT 150 back to its former 
glory. The GT 150 was made famous in the 1973 James Bond movie Live and 
Let Die when it jumped a levee over the head of a local sheriff.
Randy’s son Justin and wife Shasta are currently raising the next crop of 
boating Vances in Phoenix, Arizona, a desert state surprisingly blessed 
with beautiful boating waters. Randy’s daughter and fellow boater Megan 
Chacon is raising another boating infant named Brody while husband Gabe 
Chacon gets his mariner’s fi x aboard the U.S.S. Lincoln, stationed in Seattle, 
Washington, when he’s not boating.
Boating creates strong bonds among those who participate, and Randy’s 
primary pleasure has been bringing new boaters into the sport.

Dedication
To my wife and kids, who are ready to boat any time I jingle the keys.
Acknowledgments
This book would not be possible if it were not for the “What Next?” That was 
the name my family gave the 15-foot outboard-powered Starcraft that Dad 
bought in 1963. We launched it the fi rst time in Huntsville, Alabama, and left 
the drain plug out. It sank on the ramp. We raised it that same day and went 
skiing. A few years later, when I could barely see over the helm, my dad let 
me drive it from the launch ramp to our rented cabin on the lake. Later, 
renting that boat at our family resort helped put me through college. For me, 
boating has always been what was next and sometimes what came fi rst.
Howard Vance, my grandfather, was a guy who boated to fi sh. Somewhere, I 
have a photo of him in his captain’s hat beaming from the helm of his Kayot 
pontoon boat. He infected me with the bug of fi shing from a boat. When 
a boat wasn’t available, my grandpa Leonard Young kept the fi shing bug 
stoked: I’d visit him at his Kentucky farm and fi nd a bucket of minnows in the 
stock pond and a bass rod leaning up against the pump house when I arrived.
But just as this book wouldn’t have been possible without those responsible 
for my boating origins, it wouldn’t be credible without the boating experiences 
I’ve enjoyed later in life with other greater boaters.
Midland Michigan outdoors columnist Steve Griffi n and I paddled a blue 
canoe through the Quetico Provincial Park. That darned canoe would go 
every way but where you pointed it. We taped a new name on its freeboard: 
“Blue Bitch.” We laughed our heads off the rest of the week, and I learned a 
valuable lesson: No matter how bad a boat is, it’s good for friendship.
Bob Orth, my father-in-law, approaches boating with the systematic logic of 
a pilot — which he was for some time. For him, planning, preparation, and 
careful execution of every aspect of boating is the challenge and fun of the 
game. Mike Folkerts is Commodore of the Alaska branch of the United States 
Coast Guard Auxiliary. A week of boating with his team and watching them 
work together like a well-oiled machine taught me much about the way 
families and friends learn to enjoy each other while boating. Mike’s crew also 
moved the needle on my safety gauge a little closer to the U.S. Coast Guard 

ideals. Curt Jarson and I have adventured to the Bahamas often, and from 
him I learned both the fi nesse of setting up a boat to run through rough water 
and the mental discipline of “holding on loosely” while other boaters handle 
my boat.
Many other people in the boat building and marine publishing arena, friends, 
peers, and competitors have infl uenced my boating almost always for the 
better. I could not have written this book were it not for the friendship I 
share with all of you.
Perhaps most instrumental in creating this book are my teammates at 
Boating Life magazine, Robert Stephens, Sue Whitney, and John McEver, 
who all covered my butt while, in my spare time, I pulled many loose ends 
together in Power Boating For Dummies.
What makes For Dummies books so easy and fun to read is their carefully 
formatted style that lets readers grab concepts one tidbit at a time, sort of 
like browsing a buffet line to select the goodies you want when the mood 
strikes. I might never have captured that style in this book if it were not for 
veteran For Dummies author Chris Bigelow.

Introduction
I
’ve been power boating for 45 years and even sailed a little, too. In that 
time, I’ve had the pleasure of guiding fishermen, teaching my kids and 
friends to water-ski, and in many ways ushering new boaters into the fun and 
adventure of a lifestyle I wouldn’t consider life much fun without. In all that 
time, I’ve written newspaper columns and magazine articles on the how-to’s 
of power boating. For nine years I’ve been the editor-in-chief of Boating Life 
magazine.
Through my work and play, I’ve learned that new boaters don’t get into 
trouble from the complexity of boating but from their preconceived notions 
of how boating should be done. In Power Boating For Dummies, I do my 
best to protect you from trouble by helping you know just what to expect 
from a boat before you ever get your hands on the controls.
Among non-boaters and especially among sailing boaters, there’s often an 
unjustified assumption that power boaters are goof-offs who bungle along 
with beer in hand as they pilot crafts they know nothing about. Well, every 
group has a few outlaws, and I’ve had the fortune of watching diligent water 
cops take them out of the game. But I’ve also had the pleasure of helping 
others who want to get better at boating to avoid the stereotype.
Power boaters are responsible people seeking family unity, friendship, and 
personal growth in a pastime that requires the ultimate in teamwork. In all 
cases, power boaters want to get outdoors in a place filled with like-minded 
individuals and enjoy nature, each other’s company, and maybe a little bit of 
adventure. But most of all, power boaters don’t want their fun to depend on 
something as fickle as the wind! If you’re in this group, this book is for you.
About This Book
Power Boating For Dummies is a comprehensive guide to practically every-
thing you need to know about buying, owning, operating, and maintaining a 
boat to about 35 feet in length. However, you’ll find that the information and 
recommendations in this book also give you great foundational knowledge 
for handling larger boats as well.

2
Power Boating For Dummies 
If you read this book before ever stepping foot on a boat, I walk you through 
the process of imagining what kind of boating you may like to do. If you have 
some boating experience but haven’t yet looked into buying your own boat, I 
escort you through that process as well. If you already have a boat but 
want to know more about how to pilot it, equip it, store it, tow it, handle 
emergencies on it, or dine onboard it, this is the book for you. Even if you 
already have some experience captaining your own boat, this book could 
help fill in some gaps in your knowledge and give you some new ideas for 
improving your boating experience.
Of course, no single book could tell you all there is to know about boating; 
here are a few facts you need to investigate on your own:
 
✓ Boating rules vary by state. When it comes to boating, every U.S. state 
has its own jurisdictional quirks regarding safety, equipment, and 
licensing, among other things. Although I give you some tips about 
how to find out about your local regulations, you need to do some 
investigating on your own to be fully informed.
 
✓ Boat brands and specifications vary by manufacturer. Boats are all 
similar, but none are the same. In my years as a boater, I’ve owned a 
dozen different boats and several different kinds of boats. As editor-in-
chief of Boating Life magazine, I’ve driven literally thousands of boats. In 
this book, I’ve tried to make some reliable generalizations that hold true 
for nearly all makes and styles of boats. Of course, you should find out 
all the specifics about your own boat, starting by thoroughly studying 
the owner’s manual.
 
✓ Boating activities and preferences vary by geography. I’ve boated 
in enough places to know that people tend to boat different ways in 
different regions. For instance, brand loyalty to certain boats or motors 
can be so fierce in some regions that you’ll just want to go with the flow, 
in case you ever want to resell your boat in that area. I recommend that 
you fully immerse yourself in your local boating culture to learn the 
local lore.
Conventions Used in This Book
As you know if you’ve ever watched a movie or read a book about sailors or 
pirates or other nautical types, the marine world is filled with specialized 
jargon. Many of these terms are commonly used in power boating as well, 
especially words for boating gear and the parts of a boat.

3
 Introduction
Long-time boaters sometimes develop a little bit of snobbery about their 
mastery of boat jargon. As the editor-in-chief of Boating Life magazine, 
I regularly receive snide letters about our occasional inadvertent failure to 
adhere to every dictate of boating jargon. I respond to such letters in online 
video format at www.boatinglife.com in a piece called Naughty-cal 
Terminology, so check it out!
For this book, I’ve sprinkled in some boating jargon, but I put those terms in 
italics and define them upon first mention in every chapter, so you won’t get 
lost even if you skip around in the book. Here are some other conventions 
you should be aware of:
 
✓ Keywords in bulleted lists appear in boldface for ease of reading and 
reference.
 
✓ Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont, so they stand out 
better on the page.
What You’re Not to Read
Of course I’d love for you to read every word of this book — I worked so hard 
on it and all. However, if you’re pressed for time or would rather be out on 
your boat than reading every bit of this book, you can skip some parts and 
not miss a beat.
Throughout the book, you’ll see sidebars, which appear in gray boxes. The 
topics of these sidebars are ancillary to the overall topic of a particular 
section or chapter, but again, you won’t miss out on critical information if 
you decide not to read them.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I assumed you were either a newbie to boating or some-
one with some experience who wanted to hone your skills in a systematic 
way. You’re on the verge of getting into the sport, or you’ve been in it just 
long enough to thump a dock real hard with your boat or get embarrassed 
because you missed the trailer when you were loading up. Thanks to the cool 
For Dummies format, you can jump in, grab just the information you want and 
need, and get out there to try it out while it’s fresh in your mind.

4
Power Boating For Dummies 
That’s what I was thinking when I wrote this book. That and one other thing: 
Everybody makes mistakes in everything, including boating. I’ve been boating 
for 45 years, but I still make embarrassing mistakes. In this book, I don’t try 
to hide my blunders if I think you can learn from them. Some people won’t 
play games they can’t play perfectly. I hope you’re not that way, because 
you’ll quickly abandon boating if you are.
How This Book Is Organized
The format of Power Boating For Dummies helps you find exactly what you 
want to know and gives the information to you in bite-sized pieces. Here’s a 
quick rundown of how this particular book is organized, so you know where 
to look for exactly what you need.
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track
Part I is about getting geared up for boating. In it, I assume you don’t yet have 
a boat or the gear you need to operate it safely. I explain how to determine 
what kind of boat is right for you and how to go about shopping for it, plus 
the goodies that make it fun and safe to operate.
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat
In this part, I assume you’ve never driven a boat, or if you have, you’ve found 
the experience completely foreign and frightening.
If you can set aside what you may already know about boat operation, tell 
yourself that driving a car is not like driving a boat, and read the chapters in 
this part from a perspective of complete ignorance, you’ll quickly get your 
handling skills up to snuff and be better than 90 percent of boaters out there.
Part III: With Much Boating Fun 
Comes Much Responsibility
There’s more to boating than just racing toward the open water to kick back, 
soak up some rays, maybe do a little fishing, and splash around in the 
refreshing waters. In this part, I help you become a more responsible boater, 

5
 Introduction
starting with the rules and regulations of boating. To boat safely, you need 
to know the boating laws in your state and locality. And you can’t be a safe 
boater unless you take a boating safety course approved by your state.
This part also explores navigation tools, navigating your boat in all sorts of 
conditions, and dealing with common boating emergencies.
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape
Part of the boating lifestyle is routine boat maintenance. Many boaters 
embrace this wholly, taking on the tasks of detailed mechanical repairs as 
well as the money-saving and relatively easy task of changing their boat’s 
engine oil. This section gives you lots of practical tactics for servicing your 
boat and doing minor repairs and replacements. I also help you decide what 
you can tackle yourself and what you should leave to a mechanic.
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat
This part covers topics that ensure a good time on the water. I start with 
boat storage because taking care of your boat when you’re not on it is key to 
a long and happy boating life together. You want your boat to be ready when 
you are, don’t you?
Most boaters love company as much as they love solitude. My boat seldom 
leaves the dock without guests onboard, which led me to include a chapter 
on dining onboard. An important part of entertaining on your boat is making 
sure everyone’s well fed! And half the fun of my boating experiences is 
meeting new people in marinas and at waterfront attractions. Boating clubs 
and other organizations are a great way to get the most out of your boating 
experiences.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
I love this characteristic part of For Dummies books. In this book, it contains 
short, memorable lists of ten tactics to separate yourself from amateur boat-
ers, ten key items to keep onboard, and ten checks to do when buying a boat 
to protect yourself from buying a lemon.

Power Boating For Dummies 
Icons Used in This Book
As you flip through this book (or any other For Dummies book, for that 
matter), you’ll notice that certain paragraphs have icons attached to them. 
They’re another handy reference tool for you to highlight various types of 
information. Following are descriptions of each of the icons used in Power 
Boating For Dummies:
 
This icon calls attention to handy tactics that make it easier to accomplish the 
tasks under discussion.
 
Think of this icon like the emblem on your lawn mower that shows a few 
fingers leaving the hand as the blade passes by. Heeding warnings will keep 
you out of trouble, pain, or embarrassment.
 
This icon highlights simple, helpful notes as well as reminders to keep in mind 
as you hit the water or engage in other boating-related tasks.
Where to Go from Here
Where you go from here is entirely up to you. If you’re looking for a specific 
topic, the table of contents and the index are your friends. Find the topic you 
want, flip to that chapter or section, and get the inside scoop. Watch for the 
handy cross-references I provide to other parts of the book that contain 
related information.
You don’t need to read this book cover to cover if you don’t want to. Look at 
Power Boating For Dummies as a candy store: Just pick out the morsels you 
know you want, and go ahead and try out any unfamiliar items that look 
enticing! Of course, you can always be a traditional-type and read the entire 
book from start to finish; no one will think less of you.

Part I
Getting On the 
Right Boating 
Track

In this part . . .
A
bout 250,000 new power boats and about 1 million 
used ones are sold every year  — and that’s just in 
the United States. With so many boats on the market, how 
can you be sure to get the right one for you? In this part, I 
explain how to decide what you want to do with a boat. I 
identify the different kinds of boats that are available and 
what they do best. I also give you advice on figuring out 
what boat is right for your favorite boating waters and 
stocking it with safety and playtime accessories for opti-
mal enjoyment on the water.

In This Chapter

▶ Landing the boat of your dreams
▶ Leading your boat to water
▶ Keeping your boat running with routine maintenance
W
hat attracts you to the idea of boating? Is it speeding through the 
water with a water-skier in tow? Is it fishing for hours out in the 
middle of a lake or ocean? Is it going on overnight cruises to other ports? 
Whatever draws you to this pastime, there’s no doubt that power boating 
is a commitment. First you plunk down the cash for a boat and motor, and 
then you carve the time out of your schedule to use it. But how do you know 
if you’ll like it?
You can’t know for sure until you give it the old college try, and some boaters 
give up the game soon after taking it up. But it’s a different story for most 
boaters I know — by now, they’re on their third or fourth boat. Personally, 
I’m on my ninth boat, and I would give up cable TV, my gym membership, my 
truck, and air conditioning before I’d give up my boat.
In this chapter, I guide you through the process of deciding whether power 
boating is for you and give you an overview of what you need to know in 
order to acquire, use, and care for a power boat.
You Might Be a Boater If . . .
Boaters are like birds of a feather. As you get to know them, you’ll find they 
come from all walks of life, but the better you get to know them, the more 
you find they’re bonded to boating because boating causes them to bond 
with each other.

10
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Here’s why I love boating: As my kids have approached their teen years — 
my third just turned 13 — the pressure has been astronomical for them to 
pull away from my wife and me and get into other activities with friends 
beyond our sphere of influence. But if I ask my daughter if she wants to take 
a couple of friends out in the boat on a given Saturday, I almost always get 
the pleasure of her company along with her friends, and I get to play a part 
in turning them all into rabid boaters, too. My daughter didn’t want a 13th 
birthday party at a country club, an expensive restaurant, or Disney World. 
She wanted it at the lake with the boat, burgers on the grill, and hip-hop on 
the stereo, laughing herself silly with her friends as we hauled them around 
the lake on the tube.
That’s my story, but you may have different motivating factors. You may be a 
boater if
 
✓ When you cross a bridge over a lake or river, you can’t help but wonder 
about all the boats below, all the people in them, and what it would be 
like to be with them.
 
✓ You almost always book your vacations around water.
 
✓ You feel a burning desire to go where most people don’t go.
 
✓ When you go to the beach, you wade or swim out as far as you can and 
then want to go farther.
 
✓ You want to meet other people in interesting places and do fun and 
relaxing things.
 
✓ You find yourself sitting on the dock fishing, knowing that if you could 
just get out on the water you’d find an incredibly great fishing hole.
 
✓ You want to learn new skills. (In boating, there’s always something fun 
and interesting to learn or a new challenge to master.)
 
✓ You’ve taken rides in friends’ boats and envy their freedom and 
excitement.
 
✓ You love to snow ski but don’t know what to do in the summer.
Weighing the Costs of Boating
For many people considering boating, the major hurdles are the financial 
cost as well as the time commitment. To commit yourself to boating, you 
may need to scale back on some other activities and entertainments — but 
believe me, it’s worth it. Hey, the grass in my yard grows a little longer in 
the summer thanks to the boat, and yours probably will too. Some of the 
costs of boating aren’t in cash but in time spent doing other things.

11
 Chapter 1: Powering Up to Be a Boater
As far as the costs of boating that you measure in cash, the comparisons I 
give in this section show that you may already be spending more cash for 
less fun with other activities, making boating a better form of entertainment.
Costs of landlubber family activities
If you worry that boating is too expensive, consider the following estimated 
costs for other fun family activities:
 
✓ Attending baseball games: Counting tickets, food, drinks, and stadium 
parking, I figure each outing costs about $300 for a family of four, and 
many baseball-loving families like to attend games several times a year.
 
✓ Visiting theme parks: Considering entrance fees, parking, food, and 
souvenirs, I estimate a family of four spends at least $500 for a theme 
park outing.
 
✓ Seeing movies: With tickets, popcorn, and drinks, a movie outing for a 
family of four costs about $80. If you see several movies a year, that 
adds up fast.
 
✓ Playing golf: Not counting golf club dues or equipment, one golfer can 
easily spend $200 and more on just one golf outing, counting greens and 
cart fees, lost balls, and post-game refreshments.
Costs of boating as a family
Compared to other family activities, boating can work out to be a relatively 
cheap form of family fun if you look at your costs per outing.
Suppose you’re thinking about spending $20,000 on a new boat — and keep in 
mind that you can spend much less than that, especially on a pre-owned 
boat. If you finance it for ten years, as many people do, you’ll pay about $200 
per month. If you make a good deal, the dealer may throw in extras like a 
wakeboard, rope, life jackets, and a big, bright-colored tube to tow the kids 
around on. (I talk more about buying a boat in Chapter 3.)
Assume you’re able to get out on your boat 12 times per year. Here’s how 
your cost per boating outing could shake out:
Amortize the annual payment over 12 trips
$200
Gas up with 30 gallons
$100
Load the cooler with food and drinks
$25
Amortize your annual maintenance, storage, and other costs
$50
Cost per outing
$375

12
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Wow, by my estimate, a boat outing for a family of four costs less than a day 
at a theme park and only slightly more than a night at the ballgame! And if 
you go out more often than 12 times a year, your amortization goes down 
accordingly, making boating an even better family entertainment deal.
What’s more, when your kids get a taste of Saturday wakeboarding, tubing, or 
fishing, you’ll have an easier time getting them out on your boat than you 
may have convincing them to participate in some other family activities. As a 
bonus, it doesn’t cost anything extra if they want to bring along a friend.
Considering Different Kinds of Boats
The most motivated boaters are anglers. Boat dealers sell about three times 
as many fishing boats as all other types of boats combined. But plenty of 
other people buy boats for water-skiing, racing, pleasure cruising, and other 
activities and reasons. Knowing why you want to boat and what you want to 
do when you boat helps narrow down the many, many different types of 
boats to the one you want.
At www.boatinglife.com, you’ll find a search engine that lists about 100 
different kinds of boats and hundreds of boat brands. The drop-down menus 
at this site seem to get longer every time I click them. To use the search 
engine, select the style of boat you want. Select the size of boat, and then 
your price range. The database sorts through hundreds of boats and gives 
you a short list of brands and models that may appeal to you.
You don’t need to know all about all the kinds and brands of boats on the 
market today, but familiarizing yourself with the general categories can help 
you figure out which kind best fits your hopes, dreams, and needs. (I talk in 
detail about kinds of boats and boating activities in Chapter 2.)
 
✓ Boats for watersports and/or day cruising: Watersports like water-
skiing, wakeboarding (which is just a popular, hip form of water-skiing), 
and tubing are popular boating activities. Also popular is day cruising, 
which is just bumming around on the water, maybe tooling over to 
a waterfront burger joint or moseying over to a popular sandbar for 
impromptu parties. If any of these activities sound like the kind of 
boating you want to do, you should look into the following kinds of 
runabouts and day boats:
 
• Bowriders and deck boats are open boats with comfortable 
seating. They’re sort of like convertible sports cars on the water. 
People buy them to tour, water-ski, wakeboard, hang out and 
swim, or go on evening cruises to popular waterfront restaurants.
 
• Pontoon boats are large flat platforms floating on hollow aluminum 
cylinders called pontoons. They hold more passengers per square 
foot than any other style of boat. Some are equipped with so much 
horsepower that they can pull skiers, or they can just idle along as 
the passengers enjoy the breeze and the view.

13
 Chapter 1: Powering Up to Be a Boater
 
✓ Boats for fishing: Fishermen are addicted to their sport and usually 
devote themselves to the pursuit of one particular species of fish, like 
bass, walleye, or saltwater fish from bays or open oceans. If you’re con-
stantly casting a lure as far from the dock or shore as you can, hoping to 
get closer to a bite, you’re in the market for one of these kinds of boats:
 
• Bass boats and walleye boats have special characteristics such as 
casting decks, livewells, and trolling motors that make them ideal 
for pursuing those species of fish.
 
• Bay boats and flats boats are built to run in very shallow salt 
water to allow you to catch fish there. Boaters often use these 
boats just to explore every nook, cranny, cove, and beach they 
can find.
 
• Offshore fishing boats are for catching big game like sailfish, 
marlin, dorado, wahoo, and tuna. They’re also popular for just 
riding around and beaching up with friends at sandbars. These 
sturdy boats are especially seaworthy and easy to hose out, 
thanks to fiberglass decks that usually drain right overboard.
 
• Fish and ski boats are becoming incredibly popular because they 
give boaters the versatility of a sporty ski boat and a well-
appointed fishing boat with livewells and a trolling motor. For 
many boaters, this is a great “first boat” that lets them explore 
their passions.
 
✓ Boats for overnight cruising: The romance of living on the water lures 
many people into boating. Like a motor home on the water, a cruising 
boat has all the amenities of home in a more compact package. It has 
sleeping bunks called berths, a bathroom called a head, and kitchen 
facilities in the galley.
Getting Trained and Licensed
Before you buy your first boat, you need to be ready to use it. Besides getting 
started on mastering the obvious skill of safely piloting a boat, you need to 
acquire a few other tidbits of knowledge as you set out on your boating 
adventure.
Captaining a boat isn’t really as hard as driving a car. But it’s so different 
that new boaters get into trouble when they try to handle a boat the same 
way they handle a car. Boating safety training helps ward off some of the 
accidents that come from such misconceptions.
Some states require a boating license, whereas others just ask for proof that 
you completed an online or classroom safety course. Keep in mind that in 
some states, penalty points for boating offenses could be tallied against your 
driver’s license. You can learn all about your state’s boating laws by visiting 
www.nasbla.org, but here’s some general information to get you started:

14
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
 
✓ Boating licenses: In states that require licensing, you’ll need to take a 
test, often at the same place you test for an auto or motorcycle license. 
There aren’t many such states, but the best way find them is to visit the 
Web site of the National Association of State Boating Law Administrators 
at www.nasbla.org.
 
✓ Boating safety courses: Most states require new boaters to take a safety 
course. Some states sponsor or fund a specific course, and others 
allow you to choose from a variety of safety courses. While boating, 
you’re required to keep a certification of completion from such a 
course with you. A great source for boating training information is www.
boatus.com.
 
✓ The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary: This organization is probably 
the best place to learn to boat well and safely. Chapters of the Auxiliary 
exist in every region; you can find one at nws.cgaux.org/flotilla
finder/index.html. (For more information on the U.S. Coast Guard 
Auxiliary, see Chapter 18.)
Navigating the Boat-Buying Scene
Ready to take the plunge? Buying a boat may seem as if it should be easier 
than buying a car, but buying a boat is, in some ways, more complicated. 
More boat brands exist than car brands, and you can’t go to a boat 
showroom and find rows and rows of all the models and multiple colors 
and options all in one place — unless you go to a boat show.
In this section I explain some things to keep in mind when shopping for a 
boat, with a focus on buying new versus buying pre-owned.
Buying a new boat
Buying a new boat is a little easier than buying a pre-owned boat, unless you 
count the challenging down payment. New boats come with warranties that 
take care of defects for one to three years and sometimes, excluding the 
engine, even for ten years or the lifetime of the boat. That provides a lot of 
peace of mind! In Chapter 3, I explain in detail the tricks of the trade for 
buying a new boat, but for now here are some highlights:
 
✓ Shop around. You may find three Chevy dealers in your community, 
but you’ll find only one Sea Ray dealer. So, when you shop around, you 
have to shop similar boats against each other because you can’t shop 
identical models and brands.

15
 Chapter 1: Powering Up to Be a Boater
 
✓ Buy locally. If you opt to shop one Sea Ray dealer against another one 
out of town, you may get a better deal from the out-of-town dealer, but 
keep in mind that the local guy won’t service your warranty. Unlike auto 
dealers, a particular boat-brand dealer doesn’t have to provide warranty 
service for his brand of boat if you bought it from someone else. He 
might do it, but he doesn’t have to.
 
✓ Perform sea trials. Sea trials are like test drives but with a more specific 
mission. During a sea trial, you should be working from a checklist of 
specific things to watch out for (see the Cheat Sheet in the front of this 
book as well as Chapter 3). If you’re not familiar with boats, hire a boat 
surveyor to help you (I tell you how in Chapter 2).
 
✓ Line up insurance. Check with your auto insurance provider to secure 
boat insurance before you close the deal for your boat. Your auto 
provider may not even sell boat insurance, and you should find that 
out ahead of time. You don’t want to spend a few days hunting for 
insurance coverage after you’ve already bought the boat.
 
✓ Seek financing. Finance your boat like you would finance a house. Get 
qualified for a loan before you shop so that you know just how much 
boat you can buy.
Buying a pre-owned boat
Buying a pre-owned boat involves many of the same steps as buying a new 
boat, but sea trials and mechanical inspections are more important because 
you don’t usually get a warranty with your pre-owned boat. Three-fourths of 
all boats sold each year are pre-owned, and you can find plenty of good deals 
on somebody else’s boat! Follow these general recommendations:
 
✓ Shop around. Most pre-owned boats are sold “from a driveway,” as the 
industry likes to say. Shopping online and in the newspaper is the best 
way to find a pre-owned boat. Buying locally isn’t as important as it is 
with a new boat because you have to pay normal mechanic rates to get 
your boat fixed, and any boat mechanic will do the job for you.
 
✓ Perform sea trials. Mandatory, mandatory. Use the Cheat Sheet at the 
front of this book and Chapter 3 as your sea trial guide, and get a profes-
sional to go over the boat you’re falling in love with before you tie the knot.
 
✓ Check the engine. If your boat surveyor isn’t a mechanic and can’t 
render an opinion on the engine, hire a qualified marine mechanic to 
check out the engine. A mechanic can catch obvious signs of neglect 
that can lead to catastrophic engine failure.
 
✓ Check the trailer. Have a mechanic inspect the trailer, too. He should 
pull off at least one wheel and check the bearings and brakes. If the 
boat and trailer have been sitting unused for a year or more, you 
should anticipate a flat tire. Tires left sitting without “exercise” tend to 
delaminate or get flat spots that cause them to fail on the highway.

Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Getting Your Boat On and Off the Water
As part of acquiring your boat, you get to choose where to keep it. (In 
Chapter 16, I discuss your options in detail.) Some boaters like the conve-
nience and romance of renting a slip in a marina. Others pay for dry storage 
at a marina or other facility.
Many boaters, however, get a trailer for their boat so they can keep it in the 
garage or backyard and tow it to the water as needed. This seems pretty 
simple, unless you’ve never pulled a trailer before. Trailering a boat is a 
challenge, but it gets easier when you know what to expect.
Following are some key points to know about getting your boat around on 
dry land. (I explain all this in much more detail in Chapter 6 on launching and 
loading your boat.)
 
✓ Chances are that your boat will come with a trailer. If it doesn’t come 
with one as standard equipment, the manufacturer or dealer will recom-
mend one as an option. Follow their advice on a trailer, and don’t scrimp 
on this purchase if you want to keep your boat safe for a long time.
 
✓ Your land vehicle has a towing capacity, and your new boat must weigh 
well within that capacity to be legally and safely towed on a trailer. I 
recommend that you check on these capacities with an experienced 
hitch installer like U-Haul or your vehicle’s dealer.
 
✓ Towing your boat safely means going more slowly, doubling the distance 
between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead of you (to allow for your 
increased stopping time), and taking turns wide so you don’t damage 
your trailer’s tires on a curb.
 
✓ Backing up is the hardest thing to do with a trailer. Take it out into a 
broad open parking lot — say, at a mall that’s closed on Sunday evening. 
Practice backing up until you get the feel for it. The best thing is to go 
veeewweeeeey swooooweey, as Elmer Fudd would say.
 
✓ Launching your boat is tricky but not hard. The first mistake you may 
make is to leave the boat’s drain plug out — your boat will sink at the 
ramp if you do that! Put in the plug the minute you get to the boat ramp, 
and then tie a rope to the bow (front) of your boat. Remove the transom 
straps that hold the boat’s back to the trailer, and back it into the water 
very slowly. When the water covers the trailer’s wheels, you’re probably 
in far enough to float your boat. Grasp that rope you tied to the front of 
the boat and disconnect the bow strap on the front of the boat. Push the 
boat off the trailer, if it doesn’t slide off on its own.
 
✓ Loading your boat is trickier than launching because aiming the boat 
at the trailer is harder than pushing it off. Again, go very slowly when 
driving the boat onto the trailer. Hook your winch strap on the front of 
the trailer to the silver eyebolt on the boat’s bow.

17
 Chapter 1: Powering Up to Be a Boater
 
Any time you leave the driver’s seat of your land vehicle while you’re on 
a boat ramp, make darned sure your car’s gearshift is in Park and your 
emergency brake is set as hard as you can set it. Fail this, and you could see 
your whole rig roll into the water.
Getting Your Boat Around on the Water
If you’re into old movies, maybe you’ve seen Cool Hand Luke, starring Paul 
Newman. Luke is basically a good-hearted guy (albeit one in prison) with 
a lack of interest in adjusting his behavior to the expectations of society. 
The warden finally sums it up with one famous line often repeated by 
people today when things go wrong: “What we’ve got here is failure to 
communicate.”
Failure to communicate is the most common cause for stress between 
members of boating families. Part of the communication problem comes 
from the expectation that boating is like driving — just on the water. As 
I say throughout this book, boating is not like driving a car! The two vehicles 
steer, accelerate, stop, and go in an entirely different manner. Here are some 
considerations for getting your boat around on the water:
 
✓ Double-check the safety equipment. Lack of proper safety equipment 
is probably the most common citation written by the U.S. Coast Guard. 
Make sure you have a properly sized life jacket for every passenger 
and a USCG-approved throwable flotation device that you can toss if 
someone falls overboard. Many states also require you to carry flares 
to attract attention in case of an emergency. (I talk about safety gear in 
Chapter 4 and handling boating emergencies in Chapter 12.)
 
✓ Steady as she goes. You’ve heard this phrase a million times in naval 
war movies, but the biggest mistake new boaters make is to go too fast 
too soon. The second biggest mistake they make is assuming that all 
water is deep enough to drive the boat in. Chances are, if you don’t 
carefully study a chart of the waters before you boat, you’ll run aground 
and break something in the first few weeks of boating. (For more details 
on charts and navigating, see Chapter 10.)
 
✓ Dock as slowly as you can. New boaters are way too used to scooting 
their cars into the garage and stepping on the brakes to stop just short 
of smacking the wall. Boats don’t have brakes! This is really hard for new 
boaters to remember. In Chapter 8, I give lots of easy docking tips so 
you can figure out how to dock without crashing. But if you go boating 
before you read it, at least keep this in mind: Don’t approach the dock 
any faster than you want to hit it.

Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Getting Your Hands Dirty
Carmakers are getting better and better at making cars stand up to their 
owners’ neglect, but boats operate in a much harsher environment. Deprive 
them of the TLC they need, and you can count on a breakdown.
You definitely need to understand how to maintain your boat. Not only will 
you keep your boat in better shape and help it last longer, but you’ll save 
money. For detailed information on engine maintenance and routine service, 
see Chapter 13. Here’s a sampling of common boat maintenance tasks:
 
✓ Check engine fluids. This is like taking your own body’s pulse and 
blood pressure. Your boat engine always operates at a higher speed 
than your car engine because in water a boat doesn’t coast far — the 
engine is almost always pushing it. In a car, you run it hard to pass a 
car or get up to freeway speed, and then you let it settle down to 1,500 
revolutions per minute to hold it at 70 mph. In a boat, maintaining 45 
mph is like running your car at 100 mph uphill. So checking fluids is 
important to make sure that the engine is operating properly and isn’t 
on its way to malfunction or disaster.
 
✓ Winterize your engine. At the end of your boating season, you need to 
winterize the engine, or have your mechanic do it. Many boaters (includ-
ing yours truly) do it themselves. The steps are easy; see Chapter 14.
 
✓ Check hose fittings and through-hull fittings. Hoses either bring water 
to the engine through the hull or take water from the bilge outward. 
Some hose fittings drain other parts of the boat. These fittings can 
become corroded or broken, or the clamps can work loose. You should 
look through the boat’s bilge area — it’s kind of like checking under the 
hood of your car — and check for leaks now and then.

K
nowing what you want to do with a boat says a lot about what kind of 
boat you want. Heck, you’re reading this book, so you must have a 
pretty good idea that you want one with a motor. That narrows it down a 
bunch!
 
A power boat is basically any boat that relies on a motor for its primary form 
of propulsion.
Many sailboats have motors, and some kayaks and canoes have little electric 
motors or small outboards, but for the most part, those boats rely on wind 
or labor to get and keep them moving. Even under power, they’re not techni-
cally power boats. Power boats come in all sizes, but most often when 
boaters think of power boats, they’re thinking of something between 17 and 
35 feet in length.
After answering the power or no power question, your decision when choos-
ing a type of boat becomes more involved. Narrowing the choices requires 
some thoughtful consideration because the power boat category contains 
many, many kinds. Your choice will be determined by whether you want to 
primarily spend a quiet day on the water, do some serious fishing, or go 
long distances and stay on your boat overnight. In this chapter I give you a 
rundown of your choices of boats and engines (as well as the power you 
need) for these and other activities.

Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Acquainting Yourself with 
the Parts of a Power Boat
 
Before you go shopping for a boat, you should be familiar with the parts that 
make up a boat — for your own understanding and in order to keep up with 
any boat salesmen (as well as impress your new boating friends). For more 
detailed tips on how to buy a boat, see Chapter 3.
Just like baseball has terms that are exclusive to the sport and not used in 
any other context, boating has terms like “inboard,” “outboard,” “port,” and 
“starboard” that have no meaning outside of a boat. You don’t necessarily 
have to use all these terms among your boating friends, but you still need 
to be familiar with them or you’ll feel like you’re living in a foreign country 
without knowing the language.
Some boating terms double as anatomical descriptions and directions, which 
may help you remember their meanings. For instance, on a boat, the port side 
is the left side, and turning “to port” means turning left. Other terms are 
strictly anatomical. The stern, for instance, is a boat’s back side, or end. The 
transom is a specific part of the hull in the stern area.
Rather than just dump a bunch of text on you, check out Figure 2-1a and b to 
get a quick look at the terms and definitions that follow.
 
✓ Aft: The portion of the boat behind midships.
 
✓ Anchor locker: Usually in the bow under a hatch. It holds the anchor, 
chain, and rope.
 
✓ Boarding ladder: Built into the boat and must be accessible from the 
water in case someone falls overboard.
 
✓ Bow: The very front portion of the boat.
 
✓ Bow navigation light: A red light visible from the port (left) side of the 
boat and a green light visible from the starboard (right) side of the boat.
 
✓ Chines: The division between the bottom of the boat and the sides; 
some chines are molded with a downward angle turn at the edge to 
deflect spray.
 
✓ Cockpit: The seating area including the helm seat and aft seating.
 
✓ Deadrise angle: The angle at which the bottom of the boat rises from 
the keel to meet the chines.
 
✓ Deck: The top of the boat; the surface is removed to accommodate the 
cockpit and forward seating area.
 
✓ Draft: The distance between the lowest portion of the boat and the 
waterline when the boat is at rest in the water.

Getting Serious with Fishing Boats
If you’re a serious angler, you need a serious fishing boat. The type of fishing 
boat you choose depends on whether you’ll be fishing in fresh water or salt 
water.
Around 200,000 fishing boats are sold every year, which makes the fishing 
boat class twice as big as the day boat class. (I cover day boats in the later 
section, “Kicking Back with Runabouts and Pontoon Boats.”) Anglers are the 
most motivated group of boaters on the water. A runabout/day boat owner 
may shrug off the weekend jaunt to the lake in favor of hanging out by the 
backyard pool, but an angler won’t miss a day on the water for anything — 
anglers think fishing is what weekends are for.

23
 Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Boat Type and Engine for Your Boating Needs
Some fishing boats are pretty general in nature — they’re set up to go after 
fish, any fish. But most fishing boats are designed for anglers who, like Wile 
E. Coyote, have just one species in mind. In this section, you get to know 
the various kinds of fishing boats; I break down your options into freshwater 
and saltwater categories.
Freshwater fishing boats
Two primary categories of freshwater fishing boats make them particularly 
good for pursuing one particular species of fish and make them competitive 
in fishing tournaments: bass boats and walleye boats. Fish and ski boats have 
features that make them a compromise between competitive fishing boats 
and cruising and skiing boats. All these boats have three things in common: 
a large gasoline-powered outboard engine for getting to the fishing holes 
quickly, a small, quiet electric motor for sneaking around to cast easily from 
different angles, and at least one built-in freshwater tank to keep the catch 
(or bait) alive. When the fish aren’t biting, anglers with fish and ski boats 
even hook up a tube and a rope to pull the kids for a fun ride.
Bass boats
Bass boats are sleek and sport more horsepower on the back than you’ll 
think you need — at first. (For an example of a bass boat, see the color 
insert.) Large horsepower engines give anglers plenty of speed to reach 
distant fishing spots quickly and return to port safely.
Bass hang out close to snags, logs, docks, and other cover much of the time, 
so accurate casting and a good view of the water is mandatory. An elevated 
casting deck on the front and back lets you step up high for a bird’s-eye view 
to help you cast easily and accurately. Onboard electronics give you a clear 
view of the water below, and many bass boats have GPS units for keeping 
track of hot spots. (I talk more about electronics in Chapter 10.) The electric 
trolling motor is retractable and mounted on the bow to help you pull the 
boat around quietly to avoid spooking fish. And when you’ve hit the jackpot 
and brought in some bass, aerated tanks called livewells keep your catch 
alive and fresh.
Bass boats range in size from 16 to 23 feet long and sport engines from 50 to 
250 horsepower. That speed is particularly necessary in competition angling, 
but it’s also just lots of fun for cruising around to break the monotony of slow 
days with few bites!
For serious tournament fishing, you need a boat that’s 20 to 23 feet long and 
powered with at least 200 horsepower. For general fishing or more casual 
buddy tournaments, smaller, lower-powered boats are just fine.

24
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Bass boats are set up to make fishing comfortable for two or three passen-
gers all day long. Although most claim to have passenger capacities of four 
or more, you’ll have a hard time finding seating for more than three due to 
seating restrictions — most bass boats are designed and certified to carry 
three or four passengers only. Many walleye boats and most fish and ski 
boats are capable of carrying four to seven or even more passengers.
Walleye boats
Walleye are fish of a different feather . . . or fin. They often hang out in colder, 
rougher waters than other fish, and you have to approach them slowly and 
less aggressively than you would other fish. For these reasons, walleye boats 
tend to be deeper and not quite as sleek as bass boats, and they have higher 
hull sides to make them better able to fend off waves without having the 
waves slop over the side. (Flip to the color insert to see a walleye boat.)
Walleye boats usually don’t have casting decks because you pull your lures 
behind the boat, called trolling. And you spend very little time casting baits or 
lures.
These boats range in size from 16 to 23 feet and sport 50 to 250 horsepower. 
Tournament anglers usually choose boats over 20 feet because competitions 
go on rain or shine and they need the size to combat rougher waters.
Walleye boats are often equipped for four or more passengers, and many 
offer windshields. By moving seats around, you can create a more cruising-
friendly floor plan for sporty riding and even watersports. Tournament-ready 
walleye boats bristle with fishing gear and rod holders, and some aren’t as 
sporty-looking as bass boats.
Fish and ski boats
It’s often tough to tell if a fish and ski boat is more fish or more ski. Their 
clever design lets boaters do both, and these boats are popular among 
boaters who fish at least some of the time. (You can see a fish and ski boat in 
the color insert.)
Windshields cut the wind, and casting decks on the bow and stern can be 
equipped with cushions to turn them into sun pads. Tow pylons make fish 
and ski boats great for watersports, and an electric trolling motor (often 
removable) plus livewells equip anglers to fish seriously.
 
Most fish and ski boats range from 17 to 20 feet in length and sport 115 to 225 
horsepower. If you plan to make your boat double as a watersports craft, 
I recommend 150 horsepower so you have plenty of pull to yank up a skier.
Fish and ski boats help accommodate the need of active families with mixed 
ambitions, which is what makes them so popular. Compromises between 
fishing ability and sports ability are made to accommodate both expecta-
tions, and most boaters go on to choose either a fishing boat or a sport boat 
the next time around.

25
 Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Boat Type and Engine for Your Boating Needs
Saltwater fishing boats
Saltwater fishing boats are designed for the adventure of pursuing the 
world’s largest fish. They operate in the toughest boating conditions: Seas 
can be rough, and nothing is harder on a boat and motor than salt water. 
So the boats used to pursue saltwater fish are tougher, more corrosion-
resistant, and easier to maintain in terms of cleaning and stowing than many 
other boat styles. Offshore boats have clean, fiberglass decks that drain 
overboard when hosed down. That and their simple seating make them easy 
to maintain.
Nearly all saltwater fishing boats have livewells and fish-finding and navigat-
ing electronics in common. This section presents the most popular saltwater 
fishing boat styles and some of their distinctions.
Flats boats
Flats boats are for fishing shallow bays and estuaries, often less than 2 feet 
deep. (You can see an example of a flats boat in the color insert.)
Flats boats resemble bass boats with their fore and aft casting platforms and 
aerated livewells, but they usually have a fiberglass deck instead of carpet, 
which doesn’t hold up well to salt water. The fiberglass deck is easy to 
clean. A poling platform over the motor lets you climb up on it to push the 
boat around on the shallow water flats quietly with a pole. Some even have 
electric trolling motors so you don’t have to pole, if you prefer.
Usually from 16 to 20 feet long, flats boats are equipped with outboards to 
keep the boat light and sport from 70 to 175 horsepower.
Flats boats tend to ride just a little rougher in choppy waters than offshore 
boats because their shallower V-angle to keel doesn’t cut the waves quite 
as well.
Bay boats
Bay boats are designed to be a good compromise between shallow flats fish-
ing boats (refer to the previous section) and deeper, larger offshore fishing 
boats (see the next section). It’s not unusual to see a bay boat 20 miles 
offshore on a calm day, but most anglers who buy them chase fish in more 
sheltered bays. (You can see an example of a bay boat in the color insert.)
Bay boats have the helm in the center of the boat for balance and greater 
stability and control. Their keels have a deeper V-angle to handle rougher 
waters, but the sharper V keel sits deeper in the water, so bay boats aren’t as 
good at sneaking into the shallowest waters as flats boats. Livewells to keep 
bait and catch alive and electronics for navigation are essential.

26
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Bay boats can range from 16 to 24 feet in length, but they’re usually under 24 
feet and sport 70- to 350-horsepower outboards.
The fiberglass deck is easy to clean, and bay boats are often equipped with 
stowaway or convertible passenger seating to make them comfortable for 
day cruising as well as fishing.
Center console offshore boats
Center console offshore boats are designed to take on rough waters and open 
seas. They’re named for the helm station that holds the helm (the wheel) and 
dashboard, positioned in the center of the boat. The center console allows 
anglers to follow the largest hooked fish all the way around a boat. (You can 
see an example of a center console boat in the color insert.)
These offshore boats have a sharp V-shaped keel that lets them split waves 
for a smoother ride. Underneath the helm station is a compartment often 
equipped with a head (bathroom). Some have convertible passenger seating 
that stows away, making them fun for day cruising.
Even 20-foot center consoles can handle more chop than you’d think, but if 
regular offshore angling is your intent, you should get a 23- to 30-foot boat. 
For boats 23 feet and under, 150 to 225 horsepower is ideal. For larger boats 
and jaunts far offshore, twin engines of 150 to 350 horsepower each are 
important so that you can limp in on one engine if the other one fails.
Center consoles are as popular as bay boats for day boating, and many are 
equipped with convertible seats for the comfort and fun of large crews.
 
Offshore boats are larger, which means they require more horsepower, more 
towing capacity to get them to the water, and more fuel for a day of boating.
Walkaround boats
Walkaround boats are like cuddies (see the later section, “Cuddy cabins”), 
but they’re set up for serious fishing and open water. Walkarounds earned 
their name because of steps to the deck and a walkway all the way around 
the front to let you chase a hooked fish from the back to the front of the boat 
and back. The high deck accommodates a roomy cabin below for ducking out 
of the weather. (You can see an example of a walkaround boat in the color 
insert.)
Walkarounds range in size from 18 to 36 feet and require from 115 to 600 
horsepower for propulsion. Most popular are walkarounds from 23 to 27 feet.
Walkarounds have more creature comforts than other boats, like sleeping 
areas, a galley with cooking facilities, and a bathroom often with a shower. 
Creature comforts and a cockpit enclosed behind a windshield make these 

27
 Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Boat Type and Engine for Your Boating Needs
boats popular, especially in colder climates. In warmer climates, the cockpit 
can become stuffy behind the windshield, and many boaters find that, like 
cuddy cabins, the cabin area just collects unused gear.
Kicking Back with Runabouts 
and Pontoon Boats
Runabouts (also called day boats, usually among boaters in the northeastern 
United States) are designed for cruising, touring, skiing, and hanging out for 
the day. They’re perfect for spending all or some of the day on the water but 
not for overnighting, as a general rule.
Both “day boat” and “runabout” are terms that originated from what people 
are apt to do with these boats, but rules — at least the unwritten ones — 
were made to be broken. Some boaters sleep in day boats and camp out on 
the water in runabouts.
Pontoon boats are a wildly popular category of day boat, but they don’t quite 
fall into the runabout category because their original intent was to be a 
large lounging platform that cruises along the water at a stately pace. Lately 
pontoon makers have been adding big horsepower motors, though, and the 
added performance often makes these boats run about quite nicely.
Running around in runabouts
Runabouts are sleek, sporty, and, depending on their size and horsepower, 
can reach speeds of 65 miles per hour (although 45 to 50 mph is typical). 
Runabouts have a towing hook for connecting a ski rope, and many boaters 
use them to ski or pull kids (or adults, of course) on inflatable tubes.
This section helps you get a clear picture of the different kinds of runabouts, 
or day boats, whichever term you prefer, so that you can make an informed 
choice.
Bowriders
Bowriders are the most popular day boat. Ideal for day cruising and touring 
your favorite waters, most bowriders also have a tow hook so you can 
connect a ski or tube rope to add watersports fun to your day. (You can see 
a bowrider in the color insert.)
Bowriders range in size from 17 to 35 feet and are powered with 130 to 850 
horsepower. An 18- to 20-footer is the most popular size. Most bowriders 
over 21 feet have a changing compartment with a toilet, making them very

convenient for all-day play. Depending on the size of your boat, you can 
handle from 6 to 16 passengers. They come with open seating in the bow, 
which adds seating for two to six additional passengers, depending on the 
boat’s size.
 
When you have riders in the bow, make sure to position them so they don’t 
obstruct your forward view.
Bowriders are stable and easy to maneuver at higher speeds and are the best 
choice for covering lots of water quickly. Their quick acceleration makes 
them great for casual skiing and tube riding. However, all that speed takes 
horsepower, and all those horses are thirsty for gasoline.
Cuddy cabins
Cuddy cabins are runabouts without the open seating in the bow. (You can 
see a cuddy cabin in the color insert.) The bow space usually contains a 
sleeping berth, often a toilet, and sometimes cooking equipment.
Cuddies are great for tucking away overnight in a cove, but they have the 
sporty abilities of bowriders, so you can ski or tube behind them.
Like bowriders, cuddies range in size from 17 to 35 feet, although 35-footers 
more often are considered express cruisers (see the later section, “Express 
cruisers,” for an explanation). Horsepower needs grow with hull size, so 
cuddy cabins usually range from 130 to 850 horsepower.
 
If you buy a cuddy with a toilet and galley, you may be able to deduct the 
interest on it as a second home. Ask your tax preparer to check the rules.
 
If you’re like most boaters who have cuddies under 25 feet, you may find you 
hardly ever use the sleeping berth except to stow gear. You may wish you had 
seating upfront instead.
Deck boats
Deck boats are runabouts built for comfort and spacious seating rather than 
for sporty performance. Still, they manage to pull off pretty snappy accelera-
tion and look and behave much like bowriders even though they tend to be 
somewhat heavier and wider in the bow for seating. (Turn to the color insert 
to see an example of a deck boat.)
Deck boats let you carry two or three more passengers than comparably 
sized pontoons while still pulling tube riders. Many over 20 feet also have 
changing compartments with a toilet for convenience.

29
 Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Boat Type and Engine for Your Boating Needs
You might find a few 28-foot deck boats, but most range in size from 18 to 24 
feet. Because they’re heavier than bowriders of similar size, you may find 
that you need a little extra horsepower to achieve the same performance.
 
The extra weight and horsepower will require more fuel, so make sure you 
really need the extra hauling power.
Watersports boats
Watersports boats are runabouts for serious skiers or wakeboard riders. 
(Wakeboards are sort of like snowboards designed to be pulled behind 
boats.) Wakeboard riders want their boats to form large, ramplike wakes 
(waves behind the boat) to jump over, and some watersports boats are 
designed to do specifically that. On the other hand, serious skiers want no 
wake at all, so tournament ski boats are designed to throw as small a wake as 
possible. (You can see a watersports boat in the color insert.)
Watersports boats range in size from 20 to 24 feet and are powered by large, 
inboard, V-8 automotive engines sporting 300 to 325 horsepower. They’re 
known for their fast acceleration and rock-steady, straight-line tracking at 
riding speeds of 20 to 30 mph.
A ski boat usually has the engine in the center of the boat to balance its 
weight for a minimal wake. A wakeboard boat has the engine in the back to 
create a larger wake. If you go in for skiing or wakeboarding in a big way, you 
care about only three things: a great wake, fast acceleration to get quickly on 
top of the water, and plenty of space for your riding friends. Both boat types 
feature plush carpet, ample seating, and almost always the most rockin’ 
stereo possible.
You may be surprised at the wakeboard tower made of sturdy, gracefully 
curving tubing with a tow point on top for connecting a wakeboard rope. Ski 
boats have a pylon for the rope that’s usually set about waist high.
 
The fixed propeller and shaft don’t allow you to adjust the propeller up 
or down to trim the engine for load or speed (see Chapter 7 for more on 
trimming), and watersports boats usually have a rougher ride in choppy 
water than comparable sterndrives or outboards.
Inflatable boats
Inflatable boats are growing in popularity due to their light weight and great 
performance on low-horsepower, fuel-sipping engines. Often thought of as 
cheap and frail, they’re both expensive for their length and so rugged and 
tough as tanks that search and rescue personnel often use them.

30
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Runabout-sized inflatables called rigid inflatable boats (RIBs) have a rigid 
fiberglass bottom and a large, tough-as-shoe-leather inflatable tube around 
them for added flotation. Many separate inflatable chambers make these 
boats safe, although seating is often limited. (You can see an example of a RIB 
in the color insert.)
RIBs range in size from 10 to 35 feet, and their light weight makes them very 
sporty on smaller, gas-saving motors from 50 to 225 horsepower. They pull 
skiers with as little as 50 horsepower. No boats safely carry more passengers 
per foot than these compact runabouts, and you can tow them with smaller, 
lighter vehicles, eliminating the need for a big truck or SUV.
 
RIBs cost more per foot than other boats, even considering their reduced 
need for horsepower.
Living large on pontoon boats
Sometimes called a floating living room, the pontoon boat is the most popu-
lar single category of power boat on the water today. It has a reputation of 
being a boxy-looking geek, but on average, nearly 45,000 new pontoons are 
sold per year, equaling about half of the total runabout category — and that’s 
just new boats! (See the color insert for an example of a pontoon boat.)
Pontoons have a beamy (that’s boat-speak for a wide body) rectangular 
deck fastened to hollow, log-shaped aluminum pontoons. Berber carpet and 
upholstered couches and lounges enhance the appeal. These boats are 
ideal for easy-paced cruises, picnicking on the water, and just hanging out 
swimming and socializing.
The broad, flat deck makes pontoons extremely easy to board and amble 
about on. Their popularity is growing among the young and active, but they 
also provide easy access to the water for the elderly or physically challenged.
Sized from 18 to as large as 30 feet and designed to carry from 12 to some-
times over 20 passengers, the Average Joe pontoon is equipped with 50 to 
115 horsepower, but many pontoon boats now are sporting powerful engines 
of 200 or more horsepower, making them fun for skiing, tubing, and running 
about.
So, pontoon boats may not look like floating Ferraris, and at fast speeds they 
don’t handle like ’em either, but at 15-mph cruising speeds, few boats are 
easier to handle. If hair-raising speed and cornering ability are on your must-
have list, you probably already know that a pontoon isn’t the boat for you.

 Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Boat Type and Engine for Your Boating Needs
Going the Distance with Cruisers
Cruisers are for extended boating trips with distant destinations in mind. 
They have many of the comforts of home, sporty horsepower, and the ability 
to handle rough waters if ocean cruising is on your agenda. Cruisers are most 
often used in the ocean and Great Lakes for long-range boating, but they’re 
also popular for river cruises from town to town and are often the second 
home of choice among boaters who like weekends at the lake. Like the 
classes of boats covered earlier in this chapter, the cruiser class contains a 
number of different kinds of boat. This section introduces you to the three 
main types: express, sedan, and houseboat.
Express cruisers
Express cruisers look like large cuddy cabins (refer to the earlier section, 
“Cuddy cabins,” for a description), but they have more comfortable living 
accommodations. Cruisers have one or two private, double sleeping berths, 
usually at least one convertible berth, a bathroom with a toilet and shower, 
and a galley with a stove, fridge, microwave, and sink. The cockpit of an 
express cruiser looks much like a runabout’s cockpit but with more space.
The line between a cuddy runabout and an express cruiser begins to blur at 
about 25 feet in length. When the length exceeds 25 feet, generally boaters 
refer to these boats as cruisers or express cruisers. Pocket cruiser is the nick-
name for cruisers small enough to trailer. As you’d imagine, the horsepower 
needs are impressive, ranging between 425 horsepower and 850 horsepower.
 
The obvious advantage of an express cruiser is size, which pays off in cruising 
range for long trips and comfort for passengers sleeping onboard. However, 
their size is also a disadvantage because they aren’t easily towed on trailers 
and usually require expensive storage in a marina.
Sedan cruisers
Sedan cruisers usually have two helm stations so that they can be driven 
from inside the main cabin or from a bridge on top of it. The option of piloting 
from an inside helm makes sedans especially nice in cooler, rainy climates.
Like sedan cars, sedan cruisers have more interior space than other cruisers, 
making them more comfortable for more people over longer cruises. A few 
sedan cruisers fall in the under 35-foot category.
Like large express cruisers, size and expense are the main drawbacks of 
sedan cruisers.

32
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Houseboats
Houseboats are kind of like the pontoon boat of the live-aboard category. 
They really aren’t cruisers, but they don’t quite fit into any other category 
either.
These boats are somewhat boxy in style and have shallower freeboards 
than cruisers, making them best for protected inland waters. Compared to 
cruisers, they sleep more passengers per foot and usually sport more homey 
comforts in the galley and living area.
Houseboats can be as small as 25 feet, and these are often built on pontoon 
boat platforms. Larger houseboats have fiberglass or aluminum hulls and 
can reach 100 feet in length. Houseboats aren’t expected to perform, so 
horsepower is generally just enough to safely move the boat from place to 
place at a stately pace. Houseboats tend to have a deck or floor plan that 
allows convenient access and easy mobility on board.
Like cruisers, most houseboats need to be kept in a marina, usually at 
considerable cost.
Understanding Different Boat Engines
When you combine the number of boat styles with the number of engine 
styles and toss in the fact that nearly every style of boat is available with 
nearly every engine configuration, the options become astronomical. But I 
narrow them down for you in this section based on my experience operating 
them and on what I’ve learned boat builders are doing to meet customer 
demands.
 
If you’re an engine nut, you may be delirious with the following descriptions of 
boat engines. If you’re not, you still need to wade through them so you can 
make an informed choice of the boat and engine that will work best for you.
Getting sporty with inboard power
An inboard engine is an engine inside the boat that’s connected to a propeller 
outside the boat by a long, thin, steel shaft (see Figure 2-2). Inboard power is 
used most in watersports boats and cruisers.

33
 Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Boat Type and Engine for Your Boating Needs

Engine
With the exception of the propeller, inboard engines are actually made by 
truck or car manufacturers. The whole combination — engine, shaft, and 
propeller — is fixed in place, and the propeller isn’t adjustable, so you can’t 
trim it up or down for the most efficient speed. (I talk more about trim in 
Chapter 7.) You steer a boat that has an inboard engine with a rudder that 
deflects the force of the motor from side to side, causing the boat to turn.
Ski boats and wakeboard boats are always equipped with inboard engines. 
Some cruisers and larger saltwater fishing boats are also often equipped with 
them. Low engine gear ratios give watersports boats snappy acceleration, 
and the shaft, prop, and rudder usually offer easier straight-line tracking, 
which skiers and wakeboarders like.
Inboard arrangements are slower at top speed and less efficient due to 
the downward angle of the prop. This also makes them ride rougher than 
outboards or sterndrives of comparable size.
Tooling around with outboard power
Outboard power combines the engine, drive shaft, and propeller in one unit 
that bolts to the transom at the back of the boat (see Figure 2-3). Outboard 
power is most popular on small boats.

units hang

som outside

34
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
An outboard has a tilting mechanism used to raise or lower the motor, 
changing the angle of the prop. You steer an outboard boat by moving the 
entire motor, which sounds cumbersome, but outboard boats are really 
much more efficient and maneuverable than inboard boats.
Outboard power is the most popular type of power on fishing and pontoon 
boats and some other day boats. The maneuverability, easy installation, and 
high horsepower per pound make them popular engine options. So does the 
ease with which you can trim them for an efficient, smooth ride.
 
Outboards tend to cost a little more per horsepower than inboards and some 
sterndrive engines.
Spending the day with sterndrive power
Sterndrive power combines an inboard engine with an outboard’s propeller 
and shaft arrangement (see Figure 2-4). Sterndrive power is most popular 
on day boats and some cruisers. You steer the boat by turning the prop 
and shaft, making it very maneuverable, and you can raise and lower the 
propeller to trim it up or down for a smoother, more efficient ride. (Turn to 
Chapter 7 to get a better idea of how to trim a propeller.)
Sterndrives give you a choice of a single propeller drive or a dual propeller 
drive. Dual propellers are two aligned together but turning in opposite 
directions. They offer better control than a single prop drive but also slow 
the boat down, so don’t accept dual propellers as a substitute for horse-
power. An engine that’s too small for the boat is slower still with a dual 
prop drive. But on cruisers or big day boats, when speed isn’t the objective, 
dual prop drives make the boat turn better and give slightly better power at 
mid-range running speeds.

 Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Boat Type and Engine for Your Boating Needs
Sterndrive power is most popular on bowriders, cuddys, and smaller 
cruisers. Unlike outboards, sterndrives don’t interfere with a full-width 
swimming platform on the transom. In the northwestern and northeastern 
U.S., sterndrive power is also popular for saltwater fishing boats because 
cooler temperatures retard marine growth, making the engines less 
susceptible to fouling problems found in southern waters.
 
Sterndrive power is heavier than outboard power and harder and more 
expensive to maintain.
Maneuvering with pod drive power
Pod drives have been around for more than 75 years, but they’ve only been 
practical in pleasure boats (namely cruisers and small yachts) since 2003. 
That’s thanks to computer wizardry in boat engines that makes them easy to 
control. They’re actually a variation of sterndrive engines, but they have 
advantages so unique that they deserve a separate discussion.
With this kind of engine, the propeller mechanism, called the pod, comes 
straight out of the bottom of the boat, instead of out of the back of the boat. 
The propeller turns from side to side to steer the boat, making the pod drive 
perhaps the most maneuverable of all prop boats. And because the prop is 
situated perfectly parallel to the boat’s direction of travel, there’s no need to 
trim it up or down. Unlike an inboard with a prop tilted down, the pod drive 
loses no power to that inefficient angle.
 
As of this writing, pod drives are only practical in twin applications on boats 
longer than 35 feet, and they’re expensive.
Zipping about with jet propulsion power
Jet propulsion uses an inboard engine to drive a propeller called an impeller 
that’s concealed inside a jet pump, as shown in Figure 2-5. Jets (boats that 
use this kind of power) accelerate quickly and are the most maneuverable 
power boat on the water. Most jets range from 15 to 23 feet and 100 to 450 
horsepower.
 
Jets are so maneuverable that it’s easy to spin the boat all the way around. 
Some people do it for fun, but it can be dangerous because you may throw 
passengers from their seats.

Figure 2-5: 
Jet-drive

concealed 
propeller

the boat.
 
Jets work by sucking water in a large inlet using an impeller. The impeller 
expels the water from a much smaller nozzle that shoots straight out of the 
transom. The opposite reaction (remember your Newtonian laws from eighth 
grade science) makes the boat go forward — pretty fast, too! A jet boat is 
steered by directing the flow of the jet from side to side.
A jet boat has a very shallow draft, meaning there’s very little boat below the 
water’s surface. That’s because the entire drive mechanism (except the 
nozzle) is inside the hull. With no propeller or shaft below the surface to 
create drag, the boat is more maneuverable than any other power boat.
 
Sometimes jet boats are too maneuverable. Due to the lack of a rudder or 
propeller under the water, they’re harder to control at slow speeds and when 
docking. They’re also harder to control when a skier is swinging back and 
forth on the tow rope.

F
inding and buying the boat that fits you best can be daunting and may 
take some time, but it’s doable. However, if you take too many shortcuts 
and make an emotional decision, as with any such purchase, buyer’s remorse 
may weigh so heavily that your dreams of happiness on the water feel more 
like a nightmare.
Choosing a boat isn’t exactly a straightforward process. Often the first boat 
purchase is something of a practice run, and boaters only get that “just right” 
boat for them on their second boat purchase. Sometimes it’s because they 
didn’t read a book like this to help them sort through the many options, and 
sometimes it’s just because the first boat helps them find specific things 
about boating they like doing most, so they need a different boat to do it 
better. (It’s sort of like learning to golf and then wanting to trade clubs to 
improve your game!)
When you buy a boat, I can’t assure you that you won’t want a different 
boat until you’ve used it for a season or two. But I can help you minimize 
the chances of buying the wrong boat the first time around. This chapter 
helps you figure out which boat will help you do what you want to do where 
you want to do it. I explain which kind of boat is best for which kind of 
environment.
To get you started on the hunt, the first thing I help you do is narrow down 
your choice from a few thousand boat types to a more manageable number. 
As you start looking for your boat, keep coming back to this chapter for a 
review to make sure you don’t miss a step.

Narrowing Down Your 
Boat-Buying Choices
It has been simmering in the back of your mind for years — that secret desire 
to own a boat. Now, you feel like the time is right, especially since all your 
friends are talking about their boating experiences. Or maybe you and your 
family have just spent a day with some of those friends on the water. Now 
you, your spouse, and your kids are all talking about getting a boat.
You go online, visit a boat show, or stop in at the local marine dealer to see 
what kind of options are available. And the options seem endless! Don’t 
despair. I walk you through some essential considerations in this section that 
will knock your mountain of choices down to size. The easiest way to do this 
is to zero in on where you plan to do most of your boating and what kinds of 
boating activities you want to pursue.
 
If you’re still in the dark after reading this section, you can find a cool Web 
tool to help narrow down your choices at www.discoverboating.com/
buying/boatselector.aspx.
Considering location and type of water
Most boaters boat within 100 miles of home and only occasionally venture 
outside of that radius. Your home waters are the waters you need to choose 
your boat to fit because that’s where you’ll most likely do most of your boat-
ing. Your dealer can help you select a boat, but the best way to start your 
shopping research is to hang around nearby marinas and boat ramps for a 
day or so to see what people are launching and loading up. It’s an unusual 
boater who isn’t open to conversation about his or her boat and what he or 
she likes about it.
Location has a powerful influence on boat selection. Big, rough, salty waters 
demand a lot from a boat, and smaller, smoother, fresh waters place their 
limitations on one. Deeper water gives more freedom in choosing hull and 
propulsion styles than shallow water, which restricts the draft of depth of 
your boat. Salt water offers different maintenance challenges to your boat 
than fresh water, too.
Here are some different types of waters you may face and considerations for 
selecting a boat to navigate each:

39
 Chapter 3: Finding and Buying the Right Boat for You
 
✓ Offshore coastal waters: The bigger the waters, the bigger the boat 
you’ll need. You can sneak offshore on a calm day in a 20-foot boat, but 
you’d better have a reliable engine (or pair of them) so you can race 
back in if afternoon thundershowers and stormy waves surprise you.
 
 Regardless of how capable your boat is, don’t go offshore without a 
reliable radio to communicate with fellow boaters and the United States 
Coast Guard.
 
✓ Inshore coastal waters: Most inshore coastal waters are somewhat like 
inland lakes and rivers — except they’re salty. Often inshore coastal 
waters are shallow, which makes outboards popular in them. Outboards 
often have shallower draft, which means you need less water depth to 
float and maneuver. Outboards also are easier to clean up than inboards 
after saltwater immersion. (You can find out all about salt and boats in 
the next section.)
 
✓ The Great Lakes: You may be surprised to find out that these waters are 
often the most treacherous in the United States. Storms crop up fast, 
and the waters turn to violent chop in minutes. Follow the offshore rules 
earlier in this list (and throughout this book) if you plan to head for the 
Great Lakes.
 
✓ Large lakes: I consider large lakes those over 5 miles across. These 
waters aren’t likely to get violent in storms, but the larger the lake, the 
larger the boats. The larger the boats, the heavier the chop you’ll experi-
ence from other boats’ wakes. An 18-foot boat is big enough to be safe 
under such conditions, but it may not be large enough to comfortably 
stretch over the choppy waters without shaking the boat and crew 
roughly. For boating on large lakes, buy as much boat as you can afford, 
and slow down and take the waves easily if they get too rough.
 
✓ Small lakes: Lakes under 5 miles across are a real treat on a quiet after-
noon, but even they can get choppy thanks to crowded waters on a nice, 
sunny weekend. For this reason, many small lakes surrounded by homes 
have local laws or bylaws limiting boat size and horsepower. Check for 
those laws and abide by them. In absence of such laws, an 18-foot run-
about is ideal. A 25-footer may be overkill — unless you’re thinking of a 
pontoon boat, which fits any waters with a launch ramp (Chapter 2 has 
more on pontoons).
 
✓ Rivers and other shallow waters: Rivers and other shallow waters have 
many obstacles in them, some of which are just 1 or 2 feet below the 
surface! That’s deep enough that you won’t see them but close enough 
to the surface that they could damage your boat if you strike them. 
Outboards are popular in these waters, and jet boats are growing in 
popularity.

40
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Selecting a boat for saltwater (and freshwater) usage
Some boaters go strictly in salt water, and some go mainly in fresh water. But 
in a survey of my readers at Boating Life magazine, I found that 75 percent of 
readers took their boats back and forth between fresh and salt water, 
depending on how they felt on a particular day. There’s no such thing as a 
saltwater boat (though you’ll hear the term used among boaters to refer to 
boats used primarily in salt water), and there’s no such thing as a freshwater 
boat. With proper care, any boat can be used in salt water and fresh water. 
But some boats have features that stand up better to salt’s corrosive effects.
Salt water is hard on boats and engines because it’s corrosive. For a boat that 
will hold up to the effects of salt water, follow these guidelines:
 
✓ Avoid a boat with carpet in the cockpit. Carpet quickly shows salt 
stains and even smells fishy from plankton, which runs rampant in salt 
water.
 
✓ Choose a boat with fiberglass floors that drain overboard, making 
them easy to clean with a hose.
 
✓ Avoid a small boat under 20 feet for offshore boating unless you 
plan to keep a sharp eye out for weather and dodge into port at the 
slightest sign of storms.
 
✓ Choose an outboard motor for a smaller boat or fishing boat. These 
engines have the best corrosion protection and are easier to resell in 
most coastal boating areas.
 
✓ Avoid a standard sterndrive engine package unless you plan to trailer 
your boat or have a marina keep it in dry storage. Unlike outboards, 
sterndrives can’t be trimmed out of the water, so the propeller drive 
mechanism is subject to the corrosive effects of salt and marine growth 
when kept in the water for weeks.
 
 If you do go with a sterndrive engine, choose a corrosion-protected 
sterndrive and budget for more expensive closed cooling systems that 
keep salt water out of the engine-cooling system. Your dealer can help 
you make these choices.
 
✓ Choose a boat with all stainless steel hardware and fasteners for 
saltwater protection. Your dealer can guide you on that choice.
 
An aluminum boat is perfectly fine for use in salt water as long as you keep 
the bottom painted with protective paint. If you trailer it, make sure your 
trailer has nylon covered bunks or roller bunks instead of carpet. Carpet 
traps salt water between the boat and carpet, letting the salt continue its 
nasty corrosive destruction. I talk more about trailers in Chapter 5.

41
 Chapter 3: Finding and Buying the Right Boat for You
 
Before putting your boat in storage, it’s essential that you follow the direc-
tions in your engine’s owner’s manual for flushing salt water out of the engine 
(see Chapter 6). You also should hose down the entire boat and trailer with 
fresh water to remove salt.
Selecting a boat for only freshwater usage
Fresh water isn’t as corrosive as salt water. If your plan is to stick to rivers 
and lakes, corrosion problems will take longer to develop, and you can afford 
to be more flexible in saving money by selecting a standard sterndrive engine 
and hardware that isn’t stainless steel. Even though all the preferences for 
salt water are allowable and even beneficial in fresh water, some less expen-
sive and some more luxurious items are options for freshwater boating.
 
✓ Carpet is more common on freshwater boats thanks to a lack of crusty 
salt and the presence of fewer smelly organisms in the water.
 
✓ Some aluminum hinges and latches may appear on boats used primarily 
in fresh water.
 
✓ You don’t need to flush the engine after use in fresh water unless it’s 
extremely silty or you’ve run your boat aground. If that happens, it’s a 
good idea to flush the engine thoroughly following the directions in your 
engine’s owner’s manual (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Fresh water tends to be more sheltered than coastal waters, making 
smaller boats generally more acceptable because weather isn’t as big a 
concern. However, keep in mind that big, open freshwater bodies like 
the Great Lakes still require larger boats or a very careful weather eye to 
stay out of trouble.
Matching boating activities 
to the right boat type
What you want to do with your boat has a lot of influence on where you’ll 
want to do it, and both factors are key to your choice of boat. For instance, 
it’s unlikely that you want to water-ski in shark-infested waters (although a 
lot of surfer dudes don’t seem to mind surfing with them), and you can’t 
catch marlin in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
Chapter 2 has a complete discussion of which boats do what best. Table 3-1 
gives you another way to look at things by summarizing the detail presented 
in Chapter 2. I list several types of boats and grade them on their abilities in 
several popular boating pastimes. I grade each style of boat on an A to D 
scale (just like in school, A is very good). You can do almost anything you 
want (but not necessarily well) with any boat, so none get an F. But there are 
better choices for specific games and activities.

 Chapter 3: Finding and Buying the Right Boat for You
Choosing the right horsepower 
for your boat
“How much power do you need?” is an important question to answer before 
buying a boat. Surveys of boat owner satisfaction show that “too little power” 
is the top reason boat buyers dislike their new boats. Some boat salespeople 
try to sell low-powered boats to lure buyers into a purchase with a lower 
price. That usually turns out to be an expensive mistake. Underpowered 
boats aren’t much fun and are much harder to resell.
Boat builders offer boats with several power options priced from the lowest 
horsepower to the highest. The best boat builders won’t offer a boat with 
too little power, but others do. I wish there was a formula for determining 
exactly how much horsepower you need, but over the years, I still haven’t 
found that magic formula that works absolutely. I can tell you that after 
testing hundreds of power boats, the lowest power engine on the option list 
is often the last one you should consider.
 
In the process of writing this chapter, I analyzed test data from 17 different 
boats with an average speed of 50 miles per hour. The results point to a for-
mula that gives a realistic average of how much horsepower per pound of boat 
you need to make your boat go between 45 and 50 mph. My calculations show 
it takes 1 horsepower per 13.5 pounds of boat to attain speeds of 45 to 50 
mph. Keep in mind the tests were conducted with only one or two passengers 
onboard, and you’re more likely to have six or seven. You’ll want to factor in 
your intended passenger load weight, too. After many boat tests, I’ve found 
that I can subtract about 1 mph from the top speed for every passenger 
onboard.
 
Popular boating magazines (such as Boating Life and others) test boats for top 
speed and acceleration, and based on my experience, they render reasonable 
judgments about the adequacy of the power onboard. As a rule, do some 
research and go with the power that gets glowing approval.
You may be encouraged by some salespeople to choose a smaller engine to 
save fuel. Forget that. A larger engine running slower almost always pushes a 
boat at the same speed on less fuel than a small engine running harder. Put 
another way, in hundreds of boats tested and reviewed, I’ve found many with 
too little horsepower and only a very few with too much. Here are some 
horsepower guidelines to keep in mind:
 
✓ Fishing boats give you a lot of horsepower options, and how much 
power you want in your fishing boat depends on how you want to fish. 
Different fishing boats and styles require different horsepower.
 
• Aluminum bass boats and walleye boats up to 18 feet are powered 
well at 75 to 150 horsepower.
 
• Fiberglass bass boats, bay boats, and small offshore boats need 
between 150 and 225 horsepower.

44
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
 
• For regular offshore fishing, start thinking about two outboards 
totaling 300 horsepower for 23- to 25-foot boats and 400 to 600 
horsepower for boats from 25 to 30 feet.
 
✓ Runabouts and cruisers almost always need more power than the 
lowest option. You may test the boat with your spouse and kids and a 
salesperson, but without typical gear — a cooler full of drinks and ice, 
among other things — it will run faster and accelerate quicker than in 
everyday use. That leads to disappointment on delivery day. To avoid 
the surprise, skip the lowest power choice unless you’ve tested it with 
a full load and are satisfied with the engine’s performance.
 
✓ Pontoons provide a lot of boating fun even with small motors. Most 
boaters want pontoon boats for their comfort and size at a relatively low 
price, but horsepower options have been climbing steadily because 
boaters have found these boats to be even more fun with more speed. 
Here’s a rundown of which horsepower works best with which pontoon 
activity:
 
• For easy cruising, consider engines between 50 and 115 horse-
power. For example, a 22-foot pontoon will go about 22 to 25 mph 
with a 90 horsepower motor.
 
• For tubing and wakeboarding, choose 150 or more horsepower.
 
• To break the 35-mph barrier, you usually need a pontoon boat that 
has three pontoons and that’s built tough enough to handle the 
stress that 200 or more horsepower can put on your rig.
Setting Your Boat Budget
Deciding what you can spend on a boat isn’t much different than setting a 
budget for buying a new refrigerator — except the ticket price is likely to be 
higher for the boat. There are three basic categories of expenses in boating, 
and I address them separately in this section. I also touch on how to pay for 
your boat. You’ll be “on the hook” for the costs of buying your boat, owning 
it, and using it. This section helps you plan for these costs so you can set a 
budget you’re comfortable with.
Budgeting for boat storage costs
Storing a boat is more involved and more costly than parking a new car in 
your driveway or garage — unless your boat fits in your garage or driveway. 
Depending on where you live and the size of your boat, storing it can cost 
from between $75 per month for a self-storage lot and $1,000 or more per 
month for a marina slip (in-water storage spot). Most boat storage rates are 
based on the length of your boat in feet.

45
 Chapter 3: Finding and Buying the Right Boat for You
 
Some communities or subdivisions have laws or bylaws prohibiting storing a 
boat in the open, say in a driveway or an unfenced backyard. Check for similar 
laws with your local city hall, the county courthouse, or your homeowner’s 
association to avoid unexpected costs or even fines.
Here are some storage options to check out by calling around to marinas 
and boat storage yards in your area. Chapter 16 covers the ins and outs of 
storage options in detail.
 
✓ If you buy a boat and a trailer that fits in your garage or backyard, you 
pay nothing extra for storage and save significant cash. (But your 
spouse may complain about the car sitting in the driveway because 
there’s no room in the garage.)
 
✓ Dry stack storage marinas use a forklift to put your boat on a rack. Some 
racks are five stories high and hold boats up to 50 feet long. When you 
want your boat, it’s forklifted into the water — usually for no additional 
charge. This type of storage is economical and safe for your boat, too, 
because the boat doesn’t gather marine growth or stains or risk sinking 
at the dock, which is where a surprising number of sinkings occur.
 
✓ Wet slips are attractive because they’re so convenient. Just run down to 
the dock, untie the boat, jump in, and you’re off. However, wet slips are 
more expensive per foot of boat length, and your boat is exposed to 
damage from corrosion and marine growth 24/7.
Figuring in trailer, fuel, 
and maintenance costs
The annual costs to operate, maintain, and store your boat are often esti-
mated at 10 percent of the purchase price of a new boat. The proportion 
goes up on pre-owned boats because of expired warranties and the need for 
maintenance as things wear out. Ten percent may be a good rule of thumb, 
but I recommend that you get your pencil and paper ready and jot down 
some estimations as you read through this section, which breaks down 
general operation costs into trailer, fuel, and maintenance categories. You 
shouldn’t ignore these budget estimates as you start to narrow down your 
boat selection.
Accounting for a trailer purchase
Ever hear of an undertow on a highway? A trailer goes under your boat so 
you can tow it on the road! You will need to buy a trailer to get your boat 
to and from the various waters you choose to boat in (see Chapter 5 for 
tips on proper trailering and towing techniques). Here are a few simple 
considerations to keep in mind as you look at trailer options:
 
✓ Trailers can be standard equipment. Sometimes your boat will come 
standard with a trailer as part of the package. Sometimes it’s an extra 
fee. At the outset, ask the seller if the trailer is part of the package.

46
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
 
✓ Boat manufacturers often recommend certain trailers. Even if trailers 
are optional equipment, often the best trailer choice is the one offered 
by the manufacturer. It will fit perfectly the first time, and unless you 
choose a galvanized trailer for saltwater use, it will likely be painted to 
accent your boat.
 
✓ Your vehicle’s towing capacity is important. There’s a limit to how 
much boat your vehicle can safely tow. Talk to your boat dealer about 
the weight of your boat and trailer, and talk to your car dealer about the 
towing capacity of your vehicle.
Factoring in fuel
Fuel costs are higher for higher horsepower motors. Chat with your boat 
dealer about a boat’s fuel efficiency, and do some quick calculations to plan 
for fuel costs. If your dealer can’t give you fuel flow information, nearly every 
engine manufacturer posts fuel flow tests on its Web site. Here are some 
things to think about with regard to fuel:
 
✓ Big V-8 engines can burn 20 to 30 gallons of fuel per hour at wide open 
throttle (WOT).
 
✓ V-6 outboards burn 18 to 24 gallons of fuel per hour at WOT.
 
✓ V-4 outboards burn 10 to 16 gallons of fuel at WOT.
As a rule, you’ll burn an average of half of the WOT fuel burn per every hour 
of boating — unless you spend a lot time swimming and hanging out at 
anchor, which many people actually do, or unless you’re just crazy about 
speed and run wide open all the time (yikes!). And keep in mind that skiing 
burns more fuel than touring and hanging out because of the fuel required 
to accelerate and yank a skier from the water.
 
Don’t choose a lower horsepower engine to save fuel. Typically, you’ll burn 
less fuel running a big engine at a lower RPM to achieve the same speed as a 
smaller engine running harder.
Managing maintenance
Like your car, your boat won’t run like you want it to indefinitely without reg-
ular maintenance. And when figuring out how much you can spend on a boat, 
you need to factor in the costs of things like a new battery, repairing a pro-
peller, and cleaning and waxing the boat. You should also consult your dealer 
about scheduled service costs not included in warranties. Chapter 13 con-
tains the specifics of general preventative boat maintenance, and you also 
can find more information in your boat’s operating manual.
On a typical runabout, budget $500 per year for oil changes and regular sea-
sonal service per engine. (Take some time to really think about that cost 
before you buy a twin engine powerhouse!)

47
 Chapter 3: Finding and Buying the Right Boat for You
 
If you don’t plan for regular service intervals and then skip them when 
the time comes, you’d better budget in an extra $2,000 to $10,000 or more 
for major repairs because failing to follow the manufacturer’s maintenance 
instructions can result in catastrophic (to your budget, anyway) engine 
failures.
 
If you buy a pre-owned boat that doesn’t come with an owner’s manual (and 
this is pretty commonplace), you may be able to find it online. Some manufac-
turers post manuals online in PDF format for downloading, often for free. Or 
check with a local marine dealer; they usually sell engine service manuals for 
every marine engine made in about the last 30 years. The manual will walk you 
through all maintenance and repair steps, helping you do some of the work 
yourself. And that’s a bargain and a must for new owners of pre-owned boats.
Insuring your boat (immediately)
The minute you sign on the dotted line, you have an insurable interest in 
your boat, so shop your insurance options first and then bind or confirm 
your insurance purchase when you pen the boat deal.
 
The cost of insuring a boat can be surprisingly high and will vary depending 
on how much your boat is worth and where you plan to use and keep it. For 
example, after the hurricanes of 2004–2006, boaters in all coastal areas of the 
U.S. were shocked at their insurance rates. Inland boaters paid a pittance in 
comparison. As of this writing, coastal rates have stabilized but are still high. 
If you don’t consider how insurance costs impact your monthly expenses, you 
could find yourself over-reaching when you make your first payment.
Here are some boat-specific insurance considerations:
 
✓ When you shop insurance for budgeting purposes, tell your insurance 
agent what you expect to buy and how much you plan to spend, and 
then have him or her offer some estimates.
 
✓ You may find that by insuring your house, cars, and boat together at 
one agency, you’ll get better overall rates.
 
✓ One way to save insurance cash is to set your car and boat liability 
limits lower and buy an umbrella policy that adds a higher liability 
amount to all your policies. Umbrella policies are cheaper than basic 
liability policies because they don’t kick in for the little dents and dings 
or stitches in your neighbor’s head when he falls down in your boat.
 
✓ Many insurance policies offered by auto insurers won’t cover you and 
your boat when you leave the mouth of any harbor and enter the 
ocean. If your auto insurer can’t handle that risk, you’ll have to go to a 
marine insurer.

48
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
 
✓ Check online insurers for the best deal on coverage. BoatU.S. is one of 
the largest insurers and specializes in boats and boat-towing insurance. 
Progressive, Allstate, and State Farm are three insurance companies 
usually associated with auto insurance that are aggressively pursuing 
marine customers. You can check out these insurers online:
 
• www.boatus-insurance.com
 
• watercraft.progressive.com
 
• www.allstate.com/boat-insurance.aspx
 
• www.statefarm.com/insurance/boat/boat.asp
Choosing how to pay for your boat
Buying your boat with cash is simplest, but most buyers prefer not to lay 
down that big stack of greenbacks upfront and instead finance the purchase. 
When buying a boat, you ask much the same budgeting questions as when 
buying a car. The advantages and disadvantages are much the same, too.
Paying cash
If you’re a cash buyer, your budget is what you’re willing to part with and 
still be able to meet all your operating expenses, plus your investment and 
savings goals.
The cheapest way to buy a boat is to pay cash and avoid interest and 
monthly payments. With no monthly payments, periodic career life changes 
aren’t as likely to throw your boating and future into a panic — Wind Drifter 
can just wait in the garage until you feel like buying gas again.
The obvious disadvantage of paying cash is that you have to come up with 
the cash.
Financing
Financing a boat purchase is pretty popular, even among people who are able 
to pay cash. Like paying cash upfront, going the route of financing has its 
positives and negatives. On the upside, borrowing lets you boat now and pay 
for your purchase in manageable, monthly increments. However, failing to 
plan for both monthly payments and maintenance costs is a key cause of 
boatus interruptus.
 
Prequalify for a boat loan before you boat shop, just like you would for a car 
or a house. Prequalification helps you set a ceiling price and stick to it. It also 
gives you the best interest rate and makes you as attractive as a cash buyer 
to a seller, which helps in negotiating the terms of your purchase.

49
 Chapter 3: Finding and Buying the Right Boat for You
The face of financing is changing, and so is the complexity of it. In poor 
economic times, it takes a higher credit rating to buy a boat than to buy a 
house. In good economic times, boat loans are almost easier to get than 
home loans. If you’ve financed a car, the climate for a boat is much the same, 
but often manufacturers underwrite the loans to make the sale. Boat manu-
facturers also do that occasionally. Your boat dealer will have some financing 
hookups that may or may not be better deals than you can get on the street 
from banks, so it’s important to shop around for financing and not agree to 
the first offer you get.
Head to the following four places to make sure you get the best financing deal:
 
✓ Online: Search “boat loans” and you’ll find several loan organizations 
that can confirm an amount for which you’ll be qualified to borrow on a 
boat. Web sites such as www.boatinglife.com, usedboats.com, and 
newboats.com also post links to marine lenders.
 
✓ Your bank or credit union: Your existing relationship with your bank 
may bring you the best loan terms possible on a boat. In the same vein, 
if you work for a company or belong to a group that sponsors a credit 
union, it may offer you the best loan.
 
✓ Home equity line of credit: Although the terms of this kind of loan can 
fluctuate with economic times, a low interest rate may make it the most 
cost effective way to buy your boat.
 
✓ Your dealer: As I mention earlier, boat dealers work with financing 
companies to finance their inventory. Often, their relationships with 
these lenders give them access to favorable loan terms for their 
customers. But you won’t know if your dealer offers you the best deal 
unless you investigate the previously listed resources beforehand.
A better deal awaits
What I experienced recently in financing a tow 
vehicle also applies to buying a boat. It gave me 
food for thought on future purchases. Here’s 
what happened:
I planned to finance a new truck, so before I 
shopped, I called my bank to see what loan 
terms they could offer me. They don’t make 
vehicle loans, it turns out. Quite a few banks 
don’t. They suggested a credit union, but none 
were convenient or served any groups to which 
I belonged. So, next I went on the great old 
World Wide Web. I searched “auto loans” and 
came up with a half dozen groups with recog-
nizable brands and names, and I filled out their 
application forms. In less than 48 hours, I had a 
blank check to be made out to the dealership of 
my choosing. Signing the check would seal the 
loan at an interest rate I thought was pretty 
darned good. I selected my truck, and when I 
whipped out the check, the dealership said 
they’d beat the terms — which they did nicely. 
Had I gone into the dealership unarmed, I think 
I would have been offered a much higher rate, 
and not knowing any better, I would have 
thought it was a great deal.

50
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
 
If you choose a boat with a sleeping area, a bathroom compartment, and 
cooking facilities, your tax preparer may recommend that you deduct the 
interest on the boat purchase under the same rules that apply to deducting 
interest on second homes.
Deciding Whether to Buy a 
Pre-owned or New Boat
If you’ve narrowed down your boat-buying decision to the type of boat that 
fits your needs, determined how you’ll make your purchase, and tallied 
the ongoing costs, one other major consideration is whether to go with a 
pre-owned boat or a new boat. Obviously, each choice has advantages and 
disadvantages, which I help you wade through in this section along with 
some buying basics.
Buying basics for pre-owned or new boats
Whether you choose to buy a new boat or a pre-owned boat, there are a few 
basic considerations to keep in mind. You need to know what to look for to 
ensure the quality of any boat, and it always helps to have a negotiating 
strategy in mind. No matter what, you should insist on a sea trial and make 
sure the boat comes with an appropriate, well-maintained trailer.
Checking for quality construction
A good “fit and finish” is boat-speak for a well-made boat. In pre-owned boats, 
you have to make some allowances for age. For example, the vinyl may be 
worn or the hull scratched, but those sorts of problems have to do with the 
boat’s condition, not the quality of its construction.
Good fit and finish is present if
 
✓ A boat’s ergonomics (the way it fits the passengers and skipper) are 
comfortable and secure. For example, the steering wheel, actually called 
the helm by boaters, and throttle should fall comfortably within reach, 
and the helm seat should offer a clear view all around the boat.
 
✓ Caulk is evenly applied around hatches and other areas that should be 
watertight. The caulk bead should be smooth, and the caulk should be in 
good condition and not peeling, moldy, or cracked.
 
✓ Every switch and lever and the items they control function properly.
 
✓ Every through-hull fitting is tightly clamped and caulked to the hull, and 
all hose clamps are tight. The best boats are double clamped.

51
 Chapter 3: Finding and Buying the Right Boat for You
 
✓ It feels solid in sea trials and takes reasonable waves without heavy 
rattling or flexing.
 
✓ The hull is dry in the bilge or engine compartment. At the very least, any 
water in these areas should be slight and not increasing in quantity!
 
✓ It reaches its WOT (wide open throttle) revolutions per minute without 
missing or sputtering. You can find this specification on your engine 
manufacturer’s Web site. An RPM range that’s too low or too high at 
WOT indicates a poorly matched propeller or a poorly running engine.
 
✓ Ladders, rails, and grab handles are firmly fastened.
 
✓ Storage compartments are ample, easy to access, and allow water to 
drain away from their contents.
 
✓ The boat has a logical floor plan that lets people move around it as 
easily as possible in a boat its size.
 
✓ The engine idles smoothly without stalling, accelerates smoothly, and 
accepts some acceleration and deceleration of the throttle without 
stalling.
 
✓ The hatches and doors fit and latch and stay latched even if you hit 
waves.
 
✓ The screws are tight and the heads are snug and even in their holes.
 
✓ The stereo and every speaker produce normal sound.
 
 Bring a CD to test and a CD or MP3 player to plug into the system.
 
✓ The upholstery is firm, the stitching tight, and the vinyl snug with no 
wrinkles.
 
✓ The windshield is on straight and firm, and any panels that open and 
close function and latch properly.
 
✓ The wiring is logical, easy to trace, and labeled with respect to what 
each wire powers, and the connections are tight.
 
✓ The engine compartment hatch fits tightly and latches and doesn’t pop 
up while underway. You’d be surprised at how many boats fail this test! 
At WOT, the wind can rip a hatch all the way off if it pops open.
 
Never buy a boat without first taking it out on a sea trial. You’ll have to be firm 
in demanding one. You may even have to sign a contract and post a deposit. 
The deposit should be guaranteed refundable, in writing, should you elect to 
reject the boat for any reason. When you sea-trial any boat, pre-owned or new, 
keep the preceding list in mind.
Determining a fair price
There are no clear rules for pricing a boat, and even published pricing 
guides are sort of like Captain Jack Sparrow’s Pirate’s Code — they’re just 
guidelines. Like real estate, boats tend to have “hot markets” and cost more 
in some places than others. Certain regions have favored styles of boats, too, 
and boats that don’t meet the local preferences are at a pricing disadvantage.

52
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Here are some tips for determining value:
 
✓ Shop comparable boats, comparing brand, horsepower, length, and 
condition.
 
✓ Compare the cost of a brand-new model to a pre-owned model. Expect a 
boat to depreciate at about the same rate as a car — 25 to 35 percent 
the first year and 10 to 20 percent every year after that.
If the asking price lines up with comparable boats, you can agree on a price 
with the seller. For a pre-owned boat, the price is contingent on a clean bill of 
health from your surveyor (see the section, “Hiring a marine surveyor,” later 
in this chapter). A satisfactory sea trial (test drive) should also be part of the 
bargain. (The previous section lists what to check both out of the water and 
during a test drive.)
 
Just like buying a new car, boat buying is part science, part shopping, and 
part horse-trading. Most boat builders offer their dealers exclusive regional 
territories, so to shop two dealers of the same brand against each other, you’ll 
have to go the extra mile to visit one that may not be in a convenient location 
for you.
After you’ve done enough research to make you confident in your estimate 
of the boat’s worth, and if you think the dealer’s price is excessive, you can 
try making a lower offer based on repairs your surveyor found (see the later 
section, “Hiring a marine surveyor”) and any insight you’ve gained from 
comparison shopping. Follow these deduction guidelines:
 
✓ Deduct the retail cost of any repairs your surveyor or mechanic has 
identified. I also would add 20 percent to the anticipated cost of repairs, 
because in my experience, few boat repairs are accomplished for the 
expected price.
 
✓ Deduct from the price of a boat that’s sort of a fish out of water. Some 
boats are more popular in certain regions, so don’t be afraid to ask for a 
price concession if you’re considering a boat that’s not so popular in 
your region.
 
✓ Deduct from a price in tough economic times. You may feel bad about 
it, and it may break a boat dealer’s heart to let a great boat go for a song, 
but it may also be better for the dealer to make the deal than to sit on 
the boat for another season, paying interest. Be fair, but be firm in your 
shopping.
 
If the dealer has a sound reputation for excellent repair service, it may be 
worth it to buy the dealership’s boat even at a price higher than your offer.
Making sure the paperwork is in order
Before your boat is legal to hit the water, you have to register it, usually with 
your county clerk.

53
 Chapter 3: Finding and Buying the Right Boat for You
If your boat’s over a certain weight, you can choose to document it with the 
federal government; the government can commandeer documented vessels 
in a time of war or other emergency, such as if the U.S. Coast Guard needed 
your boat for rescuing Hurricane Katrina victims. It’s likely the government 
would reimburse you for damages and use, but still . . . some people under-
standably don’t want to do that. If you don’t want to document your vessel 
for use by the U.S. government, just register it in your home state.
Your county clerk needs the following to register your boat:
 
✓ A title notarized and signed over to you. If it’s a new boat, a manufactur-
er’s statement of origin (MSO) is required in place of a title, and the state 
issues your title after registration.
 
✓ A bill of sale, required by some states. This is just a letter from the 
seller, dated with the boat’s serial number and, if it’s an outboard, the 
serial number of the outboard engine as well.
 
Exercising your right to have a marine surveyor inspect a pre-owned boat 
and your right to take any boat on a sea trial are mandatory to concluding a 
purchase. Make sure the seller is aware that you’ll buy the boat only after the 
satisfactory conclusion of an inspection and sea trial and after you’re sure 
the paperwork is in order.
If you buy from a dealer, the sales staff will handle the paperwork for you, 
simplifying the process. That’s one way the dealer earns its money. If you 
buy a boat in a driveway, don’t release the check until
 
✓ The seller signs the title over to you in front of a notary so the signature 
is verified for the registration authorities in your state.
 
✓ The title identifies the lien holder (the person who loaned money for 
the seller’s purchase) if there’s a loan against the boat. You’ll need a 
letter of satisfaction from the lien holder that releases his or her lien 
on the boat.
 
✓ You have copies of the current registration and previous registration 
information. This documentation may be helpful in transferring registra-
tion to you, and having the previous registration information may also 
allow you to keep the current registration numbers, saving the cost of 
changing them.
 
If the seller can’t provide the title and bill of sale to you before you buy the 
boat, you’d better look at another boat or give the seller a couple of weeks 
to acquire the legal documents. Hold onto your money until you get the 
documents.

54
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Considering a pre-owned boat
Pre-owned boats comprise about 75 percent of the total number of boats that 
change hands every year, according to National Marine Manufacturers 
Association (NMMA) statistics. You probably already have a preference for 
buying new or pre-owned based on your experiences buying cars or homes. If 
you’re choosing to go the pre-owned route, I give you some advice in this sec-
tion to help you find the right boat and eliminate at least some of the lemons.
Inspecting pre-owned boats for wear and damage
An up close and personal inspection of pre-owned boats is mandatory. You 
don’t need an expert yet — just look at these boats as you would a pre-owned 
car, and eliminate candidates that show the following obvious defects (unless 
you’re a do-it-yourselfer on the hunt for a project):
 
✓ Notice the overall appearance of the boat. Does it show obvious signs of 
neglect like dirt and leaves or broken or badly torn upholstery? If so, it’s 
probably neglected on the inside, too.
 
✓ Open doors and hatches. Are all the hinges and latches in place and 
functioning?
 
✓ Turn all the switches on one at a time. Does everything work?
 
✓ Check the fuse panel and wiring connections in the bilge by the engine 
and under the dash. Do you see greenish tarnish and residue? These are 
signs of corrosion that indicate the boat may have been underwater.
 
✓ Look for waterline scum in the bilge that looks sort of like a bathtub 
ring. If that line is higher than the height of the bottom of the engine, 
chances are good the boat was flooded or sunk.
 
✓ Check the oil. Is it fresh, clear, and at the appropriate level? If it’s dirty 
and low, the boat may not have undergone routine maintenance and you 
may have a ticking time bomb on your hands.
If a boat passes this cursory inspection, you like it, and you think the price is 
in your ballpark, hire a surveyor to check it out thoroughly.
Hiring a marine surveyor
Unless you’re a mechanic and know boats well, you’ll have a difficult time 
determining a boat’s worth without professional help. A marine surveyor’s 
job is to spot defects and repairs needed to make the boat seaworthy before 
you buy it. Survey rates vary, depending on the size and complexity of your 
prospect, but a surveyor will often save you more than the cost of his or 
her services by telling you what the seller needs to repair before you buy a 
boat — or by steering you clear of hopeless lemons.
Here are two great resources to find a marine surveyor near your prospective 
boat:

Looking at a new boat
Nothing beats the feeling of buying a brand-new boat. The new boat smell, 
the crisp clean upholstery, and the gleaming finish are intoxicating. But just 
because a boat is new doesn’t mean it’s in perfect operating condition. It’s 
very possible that you’ll have to take your new boat to your dealer more 
frequently in the first year than you’d wish to work out the kinks.
Loose fittings, latches that don’t latch, pumps that don’t run, and even leaks 
aren’t uncommon in new boats. A sea trial can help expose problems right 
away, but some only show up after you’ve used your boat for a while. The 
manufacturer supplies your boat with a warranty to cover these sorts of 
repairs, but if the list gets too long, the frustration of boat ownership far 
exceeds the relaxation. To minimize the problems you’ll face with a new boat, 
keep in mind the pre-delivery precautions covered in this section.
Getting stuck with a lemon
If you buy a new car in many states and it then spends more than a certain 
amount of time in the shop for warranty service, it’s considered a lemon, and 
lemon laws give you some extensive rights for faster satisfaction. Some laws 
require the dealer to take back the car and replace it with a comparable one. 
The climate for boat buyers is much different.
Though some states, such as California, do have a lemon law covering boats, 
most states don’t. Some boat dealers and some manufacturers will step 
up and replace a new boat that has chronic problems, but in most states, 
no laws exist requiring them to do it. That’s why I recommend you insist 
on a sea trial before you buy the boat. It lets you quickly identify many 
manufacturing flaws, and when the sale is contingent on the repairs, they 
often happen on a much tighter schedule.
Understanding widely varying pricing
There are no laws requiring boat builders to put a sticker price on a boat, 
and that creates some interesting challenges in shopping.
The dealer can charge whatever price he or she thinks the traffic will bear. 
It isn’t unusual to find two dealers offering the same boat at substantially 
different prices.

56
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
You can shop an out-of-town dealer to get a better price, but for many boat 
brands, only the selling dealer has the obligation to handle warranty repairs 
for your boat. For that reason, if you don’t think a boat price is fair, it’s better 
to switch to a comparable brand in your area than to buy from an out-of-town 
dealer and forfeit your warranty repairs or be forced to travel to the dealer 
anytime your boat needs work under warranty.
Going Shopping for Your Boat
Some people search high and low for their boats, and for others, their boats 
just find them. The latter get sucked into the romance of buying a boat by the 
enticing availability of one. The former get the bug and do their research. 
Guess who has a better boating experience?
This chapter shares my favorite strategies for selecting boats. This section 
points you to the various places where you can actually look for a boat.
 
✓ Buying new: If you’re looking to buy a new boat, check out area dealers, 
Web sites, and boat shows.
 
✓ Buying pre-owned: If you’re planning to buy a pre-owned boat, check 
out area dealers, Web sites, and individuals with boats to sell.
 
Whether you’re shopping new or pre-owned boats, coming up with a short list 
of the specific boat types, models, and accessories that you’re interested in is 
a good idea. Developing the list forces you to narrow your choices within 
reason. Referring to the list as you shop helps keep you focused on getting the 
right boat for your needs.
Buying through a Web site
Many Web sites specialize in posting new and pre-owned boat listings, and 
now most newspapers post their boat classifieds online as well. The Web 
allows you to search the nation for your perfect boat.
Web sites where you can find dealers and individual sellers include:
 
✓ www.boattraderonline.com
 
✓ Newboats.com
 
✓ Usedboats.com
Advantages
Web sites let you browse thousands of boats in their databases one at a time, 
or you can narrow it down to a short list by factors such as length, style, 

57
 Chapter 3: Finding and Buying the Right Boat for You
brand, horsepower, model year, price, and even proximity to your home. You 
can set parameters for all these criteria to really drill down deep, or you can 
narrow your options by just one or two points to get a longer research list.
 
If you’re interested in a particular brand, type the name into your favorite 
search engine and you’ll find plenty of information on it, including an online 
dealer locator. Thanks to the Web (and insightful books like this one), most 
dealers report that their customers come to them with a pretty strong idea 
and understanding of what they want.
On Web sites, you’ll find boat listings from both dealers and individuals. 
Some people prefer to buy from individuals to try to strike a more favorable 
price, and sometimes that approach works. But dealers have to compete with 
individuals, so dealer prices are usually competitive — and they sometimes 
offer warranties to boot.
A nationwide Web search helps you get a handle on appropriate pricing and 
inventory availability. Heck, if you found 2,012 different Death Raptor 25s for 
sale across the country, the relative glut of them could give you some good 
buying leverage.
Disadvantages
Online boat-buying isn’t without some bumps in the road. A major one is the 
length of the road to your new boat. You have to arrange all the inspections 
long distance and either tow the boat home yourself or have it shipped.
Buying from an individual
You’ve driven through your town and seen boats with “For Sale” signs on 
them. Drive through a lake community and it seems like every third driveway 
and strip mall parking lot sports such an opportunity. Scanning the local 
classifieds yields even more boats being sold by owners.
Advantages
Some people prefer to buy from individuals because they hope individuals 
are more motivated sellers and therefore will give them a better price. 
Individual sellers may have less at stake in the sale, no “overhead” to cover 
as a dealer might, and no manager to speak with about your offer.
Disadvantages
Keep in mind that both dealers and individuals post classifieds in the paper, 
and only some newspapers require dealers to identify themselves as such 
in the ads. Also, you can’t check the references of an individual seller, so 
you don’t know what you’re getting without careful inspection. Without a 
motivation for future sales and the desire to maintain the respectability of 

58
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
a dealership’s good business name, you may find it difficult to eliminate 
hidden faults in a boat offered by an individual. It pays to be wary in these 
cases, so follow the buying tips I discuss earlier in the chapter.
Buying from a dealer
Marine dealers usually have scads of pre-owned boats and a pretty good 
selection of new ones, too. A good, friendly dealer can help you sort out your 
boating priorities and aim you at a boat that may best fill those needs. You 
want a dealer with an impeccable service department because you’ll need it 
for routine maintenance and sometimes not-so-routine maintenance.
 
Readers often write to me asking, “What’s the best boat?” That’s a loaded 
question that no one can answer quickly, but one pat answer that I’ve found 
to be universally true is this: The best boat from the worst dealer is the 
worst boat.
Advantages
One of the biggest advantages of buying your boat from a dealer is that you 
can check a dealer’s references. Ask to be referred to some customers, and 
then ask them about both their purchase and service experiences. How long 
did they have to wait for service at their last visit? Did the shop get things 
fixed right the first time?
Spend an afternoon at the local launch ramp and chat up the people bringing 
their boats in to find out where they bought them. Ask if they’d recommend 
their dealers. If they don’t recommend them, find out why not.
 
The National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) has established a 
dealer certification program in partnership with its member boat builders and 
dealers. The program sets benchmarks for dealer training programs designed 
to give the customer a better experience. Find an NMMA-certified dealer that 
has the seal shown in Figure 3-1 on the door, and chances are you have a 
dealer you can trust.
Disadvantages
Some boat buyers prefer buying from individuals because the individual 
seller is the one who operated the boat last. If you follow the tips I’ve 
suggested for investigating pre-owned boats, you can learn a lot about a boat 
from an individual, and that same information won’t be available to a dealer 
who traded for the boat. In addition, dealers may have markups in the boats 
they need to receive to cover their expenses in carrying and storing the rig.

Buying at a boat show
Most boat shows are held in the winter before boating season starts, and if 
you find the right boat there, it will be ready to launch on the first sunny 
spring day.
Advantages
Boat shows are a terrific place to learn about boats and comparison shop 
because virtually every boat model in every brand in the industry is repre-
sented. Boat manufacturers depend on shows for an enormous proportion of 
their annual volume, so they offer very attractive prices during boat shows 
that they may never offer again.
Disadvantages
The only disadvantage to buying at a boat show is that you can’t test drive 
your favorites. But you can insist on a satisfactory sea trial before you seal 
the deal. One way is to establish a contract to buy the boat at a price set at 
the winter boat show but to close on it after a satisfactory test in April.
Getting Licensed and Educated
At one time, anyone could get behind the wheel . . . ahem . . . helm of a boat 
and take off. Now many states require first-time boaters to pass a test or take 
a safety course. The laws vary state by state, and you have to check with law 
enforcement agents or your local dealer to find out what the requirements 
are. In any case, the test and the body of information you need to know is 
really minimal, but occasionally somebody underestimates them and fails. 
This section discusses a little bit of what you can expect.

60
Part I: Getting On the Right Boating Track 
Passing the state boating exam
All but a handful of states require new boaters to take an exam to show 
they’ve familiarized themselves with boating laws. Boaters must score 70 to 
80 percent on these exams to pass, depending on the state. Exam fees vary, 
but most fall within a range of $15 to $30.
Taking a boater safety course
Some states require new boaters and young boaters born after a specified 
date to take a safety course and then pass a safety exam. Some states offer 
these courses online and others offer only classes with instructors.
The Web site of the National Association of State Boating Laws 
Administrators (NASBLA), at www.nasbla.org, lists boating laws by state 
and has links to individual regulatory and enforcement agencies in boating. 
You can find your state’s boater safety requirements there.
Getting a captain’s license
Some boaters get really enthused about the 
game and want to learn more than the basics of 
navigating channels and how to safely cross 
paths or pass boats. For recreational boating 
with friends and relatives, nothing more than 
the study and licensing covered in the section, 
“Getting Licensed and Educated,” is necessary. 
But if you want to carry paying customers or 
just want the challenge and prestige of earning 
your captain’s license, I say go for it. The most 
popular captain’s license is nicknamed the “six-
pack license” because it allows you to carry six 
or fewer paying customers.
The body of knowledge required for a captain’s 
license is extensive and the test mind-numbing. 
Here are the requirements:
 ✓ Know the Rules of the Road inside and out. 
This is the U.S. Coast Guard’s book of 
exhaustive rules that deal with both inland 
navigation laws and navigation on interna-
tional waters offshore. You can download a 
copy of the book free at www.navcen.
u s c g . g o v / m w v / n a v r u l e s /
navrules.htm.
 ✓ Undergo extensive first-aid and CPR train-
ing. As captain, you’re responsible for the 
safety and welfare of everyone onboard 
your boat.
 ✓ Pass a physical exam and a drug-screen-
ing test.
 ✓ Pass the captain’s test. Taking the test is 
inconvenient at best, unless you’re lucky 
enough to live close to where one is 
administered or take a course online 
(the Mariner’s School offers one at www.
marinersschool.com). It’s exhaus-
tive, and be warned that the wording is 
designed to trick you. (The Coasties say 
it’s designed to make you think, but some 
questions are real sucker punches!) The 
good news is that if you prepare yourself 
properly and know the laws, you can pass 
the test.

Chapter 4
Accessorizing Your Boat 
for Safety and Fun
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing quality safety gear
▶ Protecting your boat with good mooring lines and fenders
▶ Enhancing your boating experience with electronics
▶ Preparing your boat for watersports
L
oading up with the right safety gear and water toys is mandatory to 
obtain the full measure of fun from your boat. The moment you sign the 
purchase contract for your boat, you need safety gear. And although you 
may be tempted to put off buying water toys until later, you’ll want skis or 
a wakeboard or a tube to ride very soon. So, including them with your boat 
purchase is really a good idea.
Why get everything all at once? The best time to build a pile of safety gear and 
water toys is when you’re in the negotiation stage of buying your boat. You 
never know what a salesperson will throw in to sweeten the deal. Plus, some 
safety gear needs installation, so you may as well get it taken care of upfront.
I describe these goodies in order of mandatory to optional in this chapter. 
Rather than read this chapter as a primer on safety laws and skiing techniques, 
look at it as a primer on must-haves such as life jackets, boat fenders, and tow 
ropes.
Getting Quality and Approved 
Safety Gear
Choose your safety gear thoughtfully because even though you may think 
you’ll use it only in case of an emergency, you’ll use some gear, like life jack-
ets, on an everyday basis, and daily use can wear out gear even if you never 

62
Part I: Getting on the Right Boating Track 
have an emergency. If you buy really cheap, uncomfortable life jackets, you 
and your crew may resist wearing them, putting you at further risk. Things 
like fire extinguishers are easy to forget about, so buying them when you pur-
chase your boat eliminates the likelihood of operating unprotected later (and 
being in violation of local laws). The idea is to start boating right after you 
buy your rig, not to spend your weekends in the marine store!
 
The safety gear I discuss in this section is required by law in most states and 
on all federal waters (that is, out to the 12-mile international limit offshore). 
Boating safety and safety equipment requirements vary state by state. You 
can check your local state laws with the National Association of State Boating 
Law Administrators (www.nasbla.org).
Staying afloat with life jackets
Life jackets are the epicenter of boating safety. They’re vests filled with buoy-
ant material to keep you afloat, and they’re designed to automatically turn an 
unconscious person face up in the water when worn according to the direc-
tions. Standard life jackets may differ from watersports jackets, which I explain 
later in this chapter in the section, “Jacketing up for safety and looking cool.”
 
In every state and territory of the United States, every boat is required to 
have one properly fitting, U.S. Coast Guard–approved life jacket for every 
passenger onboard. Annual boating fatalities range from 500 to more than 
700 boaters, according the U.S. Coast Guard. Most of the fatalities are drown-
ings, and authorities believe most drowning victims would have lived if they 
were wearing life jackets.
Five types of life jackets are available, and they fall into two general categories:
 
✓ Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV jackets are inherently buoyant 
and float without inflation. These vests satisfy the requirements of the 
U.S. Coast Guard and state law enforcement agencies when there’s one 
life jacket for each person onboard.
 
✓ A Type V jacket is inflatable, but it doesn’t float if it’s not inflated. It 
can be deployed by pulling a rip cord, or some jackets automatically 
inflate when they get wet or are forced underwater. Type V life jackets 
cost three to six times more than the other types, but they enhance the 
wearer’s freedom of movement.
 
You must wear Type V life jackets in order for them to satisfy the law. By 
contrast, all other life jackets must merely be onboard and accessible.

63
 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your Boat for Safety and Fun
Being prepared with throwable 
life preservers
Throwable life preservers aid rescues when someone falls overboard. Many 
times, one boater wants to jump in to rescue another boater, and that almost 
always results in two people needing rescue. It’s better to throw a life pre-
server to a person rather than jump in after them. Attaching a rope to the 
throwable life preserver is an even better idea because you can pull the person 
in — and the rope gives you a second chance if your first throw is off the mark.
 
When retrieving a passenger from the water, turn off the engine and leave it in 
gear. In neutral, propellers can still spin in the current, making sharp props 
still a danger. The engine won’t restart until you put it in neutral, giving you an 
extra step and a second or two to be sure passengers and ropes are clear of 
the props before you restart your boat.
Throwable life preservers come in various shapes:
 
✓ Horseshoe-shaped ones are easy for victims to pull around themselves 
but are large and cumbersome to stow in small boats.
 
✓ Ring-shaped life preservers are practically a cliché image of boating and 
have a rope around them for throwing. Like the horseshoe, rings are 
bulky and difficult to store on small boats.
 
✓ Square seat cushions are the throwable life preserver of choice for small 
boats. Their buoyant material makes for good padding on hard benches 
and even boosts a smaller captain for a better view over the bow. Sitting 
on these life preservers doesn’t hurt them and keeps them handy and 
easy to store.
 
The only important criterion is that you have a throwable life preserver that 
bears the U.S. Coast Guard seal of approval (see Figure 4-1) and is in usable 
condition. For example, a broken horseshoe or ring is verboten. So is a throw-
able cushion if the straps are broken, leaving the victim nothing to grip.

Part I: Getting on the Right Boating Track 
Having the right fire extinguisher onboard
Fire extinguishers are required on most boats. Different-sized boats have differ-
ent requirements in terms of how many and how big the fire extinguishers need 
to be. The National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) works in con-
junction with the U.S. Coast Guard and member boat manufacturers to make 
sure they meet stringent safety standards. If you buy an NMMA-certified boat, 
appropriate fire suppression equipment is considered part of the purchase, 
eliminating a decision and the risk of getting it wrong. Many boat builders 
include the appropriate extinguishers as standard equipment with their boats, 
anyway. If your boat doesn’t come with fire extinguishers, consult your dealer.
Two classes of extinguishers are most commonly used in recreational boats: 
B-I and B-II. The classifications relate mainly to capacity; all you need to know 
is which one you’re required to carry. Three categories of requirements for 
fire extinguishers apply based on the size and type of boat:
 
✓ Outboard boats under 26 feet: Not required to carry fire extinguishers 
unless they have permanent fuel tanks. Despite the lack of requirement, 
carrying a fire extinguisher is still a good idea.
 
✓ Inboard and sterndrive boats under 26 feet: Required to carry one B-1 
class carbon dioxide extinguisher. This fire extinguisher is ideal for fight-
ing gasoline fires, which is your main fire risk on a boat.
 
✓ Inboard and sterndrive boats between 26 and 40 feet: Required to 
carry two B-I class extinguishers or one BII class extinguisher.
 
Most fire extinguishers need annual maintenance, or annual replacement if 
they’re disposable. Some have gauges on the side that indicate if they’re 
serviceable. It’s a good idea to get into the habit of looking at the gauge 
every time you boat to make sure the needle indicates the unit is charged 
and capable of fighting a fire.
For a discussion about dealing with boat fires, turn to Chapter 12.
Keeping a spare anchor on hand
I recommend you keep a spare anchor onboard in case your primary anchor 
gets lost, broken, or stuck. Read more about the art of good anchoring in 
Chapter 8.
Stowing paddles just in case
In some states, paddles are required as backup in case your motor fails. The 
bigger the boat, the less effective paddles are, of course. In some states, boats 

65
 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your Boat for Safety and Fun
with two motors aren’t required to have paddles as part of their safety equip-
ment. So you really need to check your local laws when you equip your boat.
If state law requires you to keep paddles on your boat, here are your options:
 
✓ Stowable paddles: They’re about 2 feet long and satisfy the require-
ments of the law, but they’d be a pretty big handicap if you ever had to 
use them — unless your boat is only about 8 feet long!
 
✓ Aluminum paddles with plastic blades: These are the best choice. 
They’re made tough for canoeing rocky rivers, and if you throw one in 
the bottom of your boat and forget about it until you need it, it won’t be 
rotten or brittle with age when you take it out.
 
✓ Wooden paddles: These were once the standard type of paddle, and if 
you keep them varnished and protected against the effects of moisture, 
they’ll last for years. (But who wants to go to that kind of work?)
Securing and Protecting Your Boat 
with Mooring Lines and Fenders
You need mooring or docklines to secure your boat to a dock, and fenders 
are important for protecting your boat from dock rash, the scratches and 
dings that come from a boat rubbing on the dock.
Choosing the right mooring lines
Selecting the proper mooring lines (also known as docklines) for your boat 
requires a little science — and it must require a little voodoo too, because 
it seems like every marine retail Web site you visit offers slightly different 
advice on dockline length and diameter. I’ve seen many boats (and some 
docks) that have been damaged when docklines broke from being too thin 
and weak. The suggestions in this section are based on my experience. Weigh 
it against your local expert’s advice . . . and voodoo.
Selecting the right line material
Mooring lines are available in nylon, polyester, or polypropylene. But in my 
experience, you should only invest in nylon lines.
 
Avoid polypropylene because it doesn’t hold up well under chafing and breaks 
down quickly from ultraviolet (UV) sunlight. Polyester braided line is tough 
and has similarities to nylon. But it has very little stretch and can transfer the 
shock of the boat straining against the dock to the mooring points on your 
boat, which can result in damage to your boat.

66
Part I: Getting on the Right Boating Track 
Nylon resists UV breakdown, holds up well to chafing, and absorbs some of 
the shock of tugging against the dock. Here are two types to consider:
 
✓ Three-strand braided nylon line: This line is easy to handle because 
it’s supple and has no memory or tendency to return to the coils you 
stored it in. It’s the least expensive of braided nylon lines and is one of 
the sturdiest. To prevent it from fraying, the ends need to be whipped by 
wrapping tape or finer nylon line around them, or by melting them over 
a flame. This kind of line seldom comes in colors other than white.
 
✓ Braided and cored nylon line: Some braided line is made from eight 
or more strands and has a strong nylon core inside as well. These lines 
are more expensive, but you can buy them in colors to match your boat; 
some people feel that’s an even trade.
 
 Buy braided and cored nylon line in the length you need; the ends are 
already whipped to avoid fraying.
Selecting the right line diameter and length
All line comes in a variety of diameters. Line diameter speaks directly to its 
strength and, as you may already suspect, lines should be thicker for heavier 
boats or boats moored in rougher waters, where wave action works the boat 
against its lines. If constant wave action may fray your lines, you may want 
to choose thicker ones than I recommend. Just don’t get lines so thick that 
they’re difficult to hitch around your cleats.
As far as length goes, see Table 4-1 for my suggestions on selecting the right 
diameter and length of lines to go with your boat’s size.

You can make your own lines of appropriate length and diameter from a 
length of anchor rope by cutting lines and braiding or knotting loops. But 
buying lines already set up for docking doesn’t cost much more and saves a 
lot of time — time you should be spending out on the water!

67
 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your Boat for Safety and Fun
Fending off scrapes with fenders
Fenders serve as bumpers for your boat, absorbing the damage of chafing 
and bumps between the boat and dock or between boats moored together. 
Fenders are made of several materials, such as vinyl, foam, and harder plastic 
not as resilient as vinyl.
My favorite fenders are inflatable and made from flexible vinyl. As tempera-
tures fluctuate, air inside them expands or contracts causing the fenders to 
get too stiff or too soft. So fenders with needle valves such as you’d find on a 
basketball let you add or release air when temperature changes make them 
harder or softer. Some also have little pumps built in that actually let you add 
air to stiffen them without a basketball pump.
Fenders made from polyethylene foam don’t need air at all, but in rougher 
waters they tend to wear out quickly and are more apt to get embedded grit 
or splinters that will scratch the boat, which is what you buy them to avoid. 
Foam fenders usually cost less than vinyl, though, and if you use care in stor-
ing them, they work well enough.
 
Beyond durability, the material isn’t as important as choosing the right size of 
fenders for your boat. Bigger fenders offer more protection than smaller ones, 
but storage becomes an issue. The optimum size both protects your boat and 
stows away in the compartments onboard.
I keep six fenders on my 25-foot boat. That’s a pretty good number for boats 
up to 40 feet. Smaller boats can get by with two to four fenders. Table 4-2 
helps you choose the right size and number of fenders to fit your boat.
Boat hooks help you handle lines and more
While not a required safety item, a boat hook 
is handy around a boat. It’s a long pole with a 
hook on the end, and you use it to loop lines 
over pilings or remove them when they’re out 
of reach. A boat hook is also handy for snagging 
a cap that takes a dive overboard.

Communicating and Navigating 
Safely with Marine Electronics
It seems like everything’s going high tech these days, and when you’re con-
sidering a boat purchase, marine electronics should be part of your thought 
process. I get more in-depth about boating electronics and their use in 
Chapter 10, but this section gets you started with an understanding of what’s 
available and how it can make for a safer, more comfortable experience on 
the water.
The bottom line is that marine electronics make boating safer. And lucky 
for you, devices are small and easy to use. For example, a navigation system 
that once required a bathroom-sized compartment now fits in a package the 
size of a paperback copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea. You have 
quite a selection of brands and models to choose from, and the applications 
include radar, navigation assistance, and communications.
Avoiding the bottom thanks 
to a depth finder
There’s a saying among boaters that goes like this: “There are boaters who 
have run aground and those who lie and say they haven’t.” You’ll likely run 
aground, too, unfortunately. I admit to having done it more than once.
Depth finders help you avoid hitting what’s below the surface of the water. 
Also called a sonar unit or bottom finder, a depth finder helps you avoid hit-
ting rocks and sandbars if you navigate cautiously and keep one eye on the 
screen. Many sonar devices are sold to anglers who use them to spot fish and 
the things on the bottom that fish may call home. (I discuss sonar depth find-
ers in more detail in Chapter 10.)

69
 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your Boat for Safety and Fun
 
If you’re traveling fast in unfamiliar water, the depth finder can’t report depth 
changes fast enough to keep you off the rocks.
If you plan to use your boat for cruising and skiing, the simplest depth finder 
will be very helpful. You can buy a good monochrome LCD-screen depth 
finder that will be useful to depths of a couple hundred feet for around $100. 
If you’re an angler, you may want to invest in a unit that gives more detailed 
information. You can spend as much as $2,000 for color units with greater 
detail and better ability to distinguish fish.
Verifying your location with a GPS
Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have become so easy to use in cars and 
even on cellphones that they’re a natural tool to have even on small boats. 
(I’m not letting you give up on a compass, though; it may be low tech, but 
when my GPS went out 20 miles offshore on a sunless day, my trusty com-
pass led me home.)
For around $100, you can buy a new GPS unit that could get you around the 
world if you wanted to try. I suspect your aspirations in boating are less 
extreme, but even if you just stick to small lakes, I recommend you get one. 
Avoiding damage to your boat can make a GPS unit a pretty economical buy. 
Just think: A new propeller for your engine can cost as much as $500, but 
with a $500 GPS chart-plotter that includes built-in charts, you can easily 
avoid the rocky obstructions that could destroy your propeller. And in the 
event you lose a propeller and don’t have a spare onboard, being able to 
pinpoint your exact location when you call for help can be very handy! (See 
Chapter 12 for details on how to deal with boating emergencies and make 
emergency calls.)
In treacherous waters, depth finders work hand in hand with GPS, but neither 
is a substitute for the other.
The cost of GPS units increases with additional features such as a larger 
screen, improved screen visibility in sunlight, and more detailed charts. For 
$100 you can get a handheld unit that tracks your course and allows you to 
enter waypoints, which are sort of like the addresses of spots you’ve visited 
and would like to revisit later. You record waypoints in latitude and longitude 
terms, and GPS units let you enter a convenient name to remember them 
by. Bump the ticket price to $200 to get basic mapping capability in order to 
avoid the rocks; some built-in units can even run several thousand dollars — 
and for the right guy or gal, they’re worth it. See Chapter 10 for more informa-
tion on GPS and other navigation tools.

Staying in touch with a VHF radio
A VHF radio is useful on big waters. It’s not required by law, but I wouldn’t 
venture offshore or into the Great Lakes without one. The U.S. Coast Guard can 
often determine your position in an emergency by tracking your VHF signal. 
You should get one of these radios for its ability to aid in rescues alone.
Handheld VHF radios are ideal for small boats. If you follow VHF radio pro-
tocol, you can even have some fun keeping in touch with fellow boaters. You 
can usually have a good one, including an antenna, installed on your boat for 
about $400. Chapter 10 has more information on selecting a VHF radio, and 
Chapter 12 tells you how to make emergency calls.
Choosing Safe, Fun Watersports 
Accessories
The right water toys can broaden your boating fun. Board sports like skiing 
and wakeboarding can be fun, and serious riders can go all out and enter 
competitions. Tubing is just like a wet roller coaster ride. This section is a 
rundown of the toys and their games to get you thinking about what you 
want to buy to ensure that everyone on your boat has a great time.
Inflating the fun with tubes
The most popular towed water toy is an inflatable tube. Originally, boaters 
just towed an inner tube from a tractor or truck tire. Now, an entire industry 
supports the fun of towable inflatables. They seldom look like tubes anymore 
(see Figure 4-2), but boaters still call the sport tubing.
These toys come in a variety of shapes and sizes and can be intended for 
one passenger or several. A two-passenger deck tube is most popular and 
sells for about $100 to $150. Tubes take no skill to ride, just the guts to hang 
onto the padded handles as the boat driver yanks you through S turns and 
crack-the-whip maneuvers. For any type of tube, you need an inflator as well. 
I like 12-volt pumps because you can blow up the tube in a few minutes right 
on the water, and then deflate it and stow it and the pump in a compartment 
when you’re done.
 
For safety and a better tube ride, blow up the tube drum-tight. Soft tubes are 
apt to tear or puncture. You should be able to stand on a properly inflated 
tube without it compressing more than 1 or 2 inches.

Washing away boredom with wakeboards
Wakeboard riding evolved from snowboarding, and the riders who do it have 
developed a culture all their own, much like surfers. Figure 4-3 shows a wake-
board rider suiting up.
The wakeboard is about 4 feet long and 15 inches wide with bootlike bind-
ings that securely hold the feet. The size can vary somewhat, meaning larger 
boards for larger people and smaller boards for smaller folks. You can even 
get kid-sized wakeboards. When the bindings are tight enough to do their job, 
it takes a special lubricant to help slip your feet in them. The later section, 
“Selecting the correct tow rope to match your watersport,” tells you what 
kind of tow rope to buy for wakeboarding. Wakeboard riders love to jump the 
wake, performing spins and flips as they go. An ideal speed for wakeboarding 
is 20 to 25 mph.
 
If you plan to get one wakeboard for your family and guests to share, choose 
one around 4 feet by 15 inches. Some boards are available with universally 
adjustable bindings to fit nearly any size foot. As riders get more skilled and 
more enthusiastic about the sport, they’ll certainly want to get custom boards 
with fitted bindings — just like snowboarders or skiers.

Getting started on two skis
A pair of skis, or combo set, is the most popular starting place for watersports 
enthusiasts. Two skis give riders more lift and can make the job of getting up 
out of the water easier. Few people who get up on two skis and like it ever stick 
to two skis for long, though; usually they want to progress quickly to one ski 
(whether one standard ski or a slalom ski, which I address in the next section).
Cracking the whip with tubes
One of the most fun (and mildly terrifying, if 
you overdo it) tubing maneuvers is crack the 
whip. The idea is to swing the tube far outside 
the wake and then bounce it and its riders 
over waves. To do it, you turn the boat in one 
direction until the tube slides over your outside 
wake, and then turn the helm hard in the other 
direction to make the tube jump back across 
your wake and zoom way out to the side on the 
end of the rope. Hold the turn until you cross 
your wake to give the riders a really bumpy ride. 
Just don’t go too fast: The ideal speed for tubing 
is about 20 miles per hour. Remember, when the 
boat is turning a small circle, the tube is making 
a large one and going much faster as a result.

73
 Chapter 4: Accessorizing Your Boat for Safety and Fun
Most combo skis have one ski with two foot bindings so the rider can quickly 
transition to skiing slalom on that one ski. Combo skis come in child, youth, 
and adult sizes, and it’s best to match the combo to the rider. Trying to learn 
on skis that are too large or small is frustrating, so if you plan to entertain 
people of all ages on your boat, you may want to consider buying a pair in 
each size so that everyone can join in the fun and give skiing a try. Expect to 
spend $150 to $300 for a pair of combo skis, depending on the size.
 
The trick to getting a skier up is giving the boat just the right amount of accel-
eration to get the skier out of the water, and then pulling back on the throttle 
to settle into a speed of about 20 mph.
Slipping through the water on a slalom ski
In recent years, slalom skiing seems to have lost favor to wakeboarding, just 
as snow skiing has lost ground to snowboarding. But for skiers who get into 
it, nothing beats the feeling of gliding back and forth on glassy smooth water 
on a single slalom ski.
Most slalom skis are made of fiberglass and other composite materials with 
fixed or adjustable bindings for your feet. A tunnel, or large groove on the 
bottom, gives better control when turning or “cutting” from side to side, and 
a deep fin on the back adds stability in turns. You can easily spend $300 to 
$500 on a good slalom ski. Slalom skis are sized differently for skiers of dif-
ferent sizes, and a ski shop can help you choose the one best for you. For 
children, you can often use combo skis because one ski will have bindings for 
each foot. The next section tells you what kind of tow rope to buy.
It takes plenty of power to get a slalom skier up out of the water — usually 
full throttle acceleration for an adult. Then, quickly back off and adjust the 
speed to 25 to 30 mph.
Selecting the correct tow rope 
to match your watersport
Selecting the correct tow rope for watersports isn’t hard as long as you 
remember that each game needs a different kind of rope.
All tow ropes have a loop on one end to attach to the boat’s tow point. The 
tow point is a sturdy ring on the transom, or back of the boat. Some boats 
have towers or pylons for towing, in which case there’s a knob on the top 
that holds the rope’s loop.
Here’s the breakdown of tow ropes by watersport:

74
Part I: Getting on the Right Boating Track 
 
✓ Tubing: You need a much thicker and sturdier rope than for other water-
sports. Tubing ropes are labeled for the passenger load, so buy one to 
match the size of tube you buy. A tube rope has a loop on one end and a 
nylon connector or a loop for attaching to the tube on the other.
 
✓ Wakeboarding: You need a rope with as little stretch as possible 
because stretch makes it harder to control your ride. The best wake-
board ropes are made of Spectra fibers that have virtually no stretch. 
They’re costly, but riding without them isn’t as much fun. The handle 
should be about 15 inches long to make it easy to switch hands, and it 
should be padded to help prevent blisters.
 
✓ Water-skiing: You need a nylon rope with a little bit of stretch in it. The 
stretch absorbs shock when you cut back and forth. The handle should 
be about 12 inches long and padded to cushion your hands and prevent 
blisters.
Jacketing up for safety and looking cool
Any time you mention safety to a bunch of eager kids ready to hit the water, 
you’re apt to get groans and bored looks. But watersports jackets — life jack-
ets for tubing, wakeboarding, and skiing — are anything but boring. Cool 
brands and hip, surf-looking styles are blended into watersports jackets that 
fit snugly and trim, keep you afloat if you fall, and protect your ribs from the 
effects of hard falls.
Competitive skiers and wakeboarders once rode without life jackets, feeling 
that their experience and familiarity with the water was enough to protect 
them in falls. But serious accidents and fatalities eventually changed that out-
look, and flotation devices have become a must. Here are some tips on what 
to look for to protect your riders:
 
✓ Durability is key. Life jackets can double as watersports jackets, but 
they must meet a higher standard of durability to do their job for skiers. 
Labels on watersports jackets indicate a jacket’s suitability for both reg-
ular boat safety and watersports. (Some watersports jackets are suitable 
only for riding.) For more on standard life jackets, refer to the earlier 
section, “Staying afloat with life jackets.”
 
✓ One size can fit many users. Most watersports jackets are highly adjust-
able, which lets you fit the jacket snugly and safely to a rider as well as 
use it for other riders of similar size.
 
✓ Comfort comes from a good fit but also from new uses of old materi-
als. For example, neoprene was once used mostly in diving wetsuits, but 
now thicker neoprene pads sewn into neoprene jackets with durable 
web straps and tough buckles make watersports life jackets more com-
fortable than standard flotation materials in regular life jackets.

iloting a boat is fairly easy to master — in fact, some 
people say the hardest part of boating is getting the 
boat into the water. Trailering a boat isn’t nearly as much 
fun as boating, but to make it even easier, in this part I 
explain step-by-step tactics for getting your boat around 
on dry land and launching it like a pro. I explain how to 
handle your boat in open water like you’ve been boating

Maintaining Your Trailer
In This Chapter

F
or many people considering buying a boat, the most daunting challenge 
may be getting comfortable with the idea of maneuvering a boat on a 
trailer on the highway and into the lake. Although a boat and vehicle sinking 
beneath the waves or crashing through the side of a garage, or an unhitched 
boat zipping down the wrong side of the road may make for funny videos, 
you don’t want these things to happen to you! (However, you may want to 
keep a video camera handy, just in case.)
Sometimes, towing difficulties can be attributed to a bad match between boat 
and trailer — a problem simply solved with a different trailer. Most often, 
though, the explanation is merely lack of comfort with what can seem like 
a juggling act between hitching the boat and getting it to the water. Relax! 
Towing techniques are easy to pick up and will come naturally after some 
practice.
Understand the principles (which I share in this chapter) and practice 
maneuvering your trailer in the right environment, and you’ll master it in no 
time. Then you’ll want to make sure you keep your trailer roadworthy and 
consider purchasing some inexpensive trailer accessories to make trailering 
and towing even easier.
In this chapter, I lay out how to hitch, pull, and back-up your trailer safely. I 
also cover essential trailer maintenance and recommend some handy trailer 
add-ons.

78
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Getting Properly and Safely Hitched
The first step in safe towing is getting your boat-loaded trailer properly and 
securely connected (or hitched) to your towing vehicle.
 
I like to keep things upbeat and optimistic, but a couple of worst-case scenar-
ios can convince you not to skip this chapter.
 
✓ If you forget to latch the hitch but remember to hook up the chains, your 
hitch could come uncoupled, letting your trailer sway around behind 
you. As you try to stop it — which you should attempt to do quickly — it 
will bang against your vehicle, breaking windows, bending fenders, and 
ruining an otherwise perfectly good time.
 
✓ When improperly hitched, some trailers come loose and can cross into 
another lane at worst or roll into a ditch and flip at best. Few such inci-
dents end well for anyone.
To get your boat hitched up right, you need to know the parts of the equip-
ment and what to do with them. To back your vehicle up to the trailer, you 
need a spotter (any boating buddy can help here) to keep an eye on the hitch 
ball and the trailer tongue and to guide you as you back the vehicle to the 
trailer. Finally, you should employ a standard routine for ensuring everything 
is secure.
Defining the parts of the 
vehicle-trailer connection
To ensure a good connection between your towing vehicle and trailer, it’s 
important to know the parts you’re dealing with and how they work together. 
Following is a list of the parts and explanations of what they do; they’re illus-
trated in Figure 5-1:
 
✓ Ball (also called ball hitch): This looks like its name and is a steel ball 
on the ball mount. It fits into the socket on the tongue of the trailer.
 
✓ Ball mount: The ball mount is the steel bar with a hole in it into which 
you screw the ball. On some hitches, the ball mount is permanently 
attached to the vehicle. On others, it slides into a socket and is held 
there by a thick steel pin.
 
✓ Bow strap: At the bow (that’s the pointy end), you hook the winch strap 
to the bow eye and turn the crank on the winch to reel in the bow strap, 
thus dragging the boat into place on the trailer.

79
 Chapter 5: Towing Your Boat and Maintaining Your Trailer
 
✓ Brake cable: This is a thin wire with an S-shaped hook at the end. For 
safety, it must be hooked to one of the safety chain loops on the vehicle 
hitch.
 
✓ Eye bolts: These bolts have a ring in the end that accepts the strap 
hooks. Sometimes you knot lines onto them.
 
✓ Hitch locking lever: This lever is on the tongue of the trailer near the 
ball socket. To lower the ball socket onto the ball, the lever must be up 
in the unlocked position. After the socket is fully seated on the ball, you 
must press the lever down into the latched position.
 
✓ Locking pin: Many trailers come with a locking pin attached to the 
trailer tongue by a small chain or cable. You insert this pin into a hole 
on the hitch-locking lever to prevent the lever from working itself to the 
unlatched position.
 
 If your trailer doesn’t come with a locking pin, which may be the case 
with a pre-owned trailer, use a small padlock to secure the connection.
 
✓ Safety chain loops: Heavy steel loops on either side of the ball mount on 
the vehicle receive the safety chain hooks from the trailer.
 
✓ Safety chains: These are heavy chains fastened permanently to the 
trailer. They have hooks on the other end that you hook to the heavy 
steel safety chain loops on the vehicle hitch.
 
✓ Tongue jack: The tongue jack is mounted on the tongue of the trailer 
and has a hand crank that, when twisted, lowers or raises the trailer 
tongue to allow you to hitch or unhitch the trailer.
 
✓ Trailer coupler: This is the term for the entire mechanism on the tongue 
of your trailer.
 
✓ Trailer running light plug: This plug may be round or flat on your 
trailer. You insert it into a similar socket or plug on the tow vehicle. It 
powers your trailer’s running lights, turn signals, and brake lights.
 
✓ Trailer tongue jack: The heavier your trailer, the more likely it is to have 
a tongue jack near the ball socket. A crank on the jack raises and lowers 
it. Some jacks can be swiveled parallel with the tongue so they’re fully 
out of the way when towing.
 
✓ Transom straps: These two heavy nylon web straps are designed to 
keep the trailer and the boat tightly connected during towing. They’re 
not permanently attached to the trailer but rather are hooked to eye-
bolts on the trailer and stern. You remove the straps before launching 
and fasten them into place after loading.

Getting help aligning your 
vehicle and trailer
 
Never try pulling a trailer to your towing vehicle by hand, especially with the 
boat on it. It’s safer and smarter to move the vehicle to the trailer. Although 
you may be able pick up some trailers by hand and pull them to the vehicle, 
it’s a risky move because you may not be able to stop the trailer from rolling 
after it starts going, and it could damage your vehicle. Or you may pull a 
muscle lifting it.
When trying to get your vehicle in place, it helps to have a spotter to guide 
you while you back up to the trailer as slowly as you reasonably can (that 
lake or river isn’t going anywhere!). Most any boating partner should be able 
to stand by the trailer and guide you with the following simple, intuitive hand 
signals:
 
✓ Moving his or her hands progressively closer together to indicate the 
progress of the hitch moving toward the trailer tongue
 
✓ Pointing to the right or left and spreading his or her hands apart or 
moving them closer together as needed to show you how much to move 
to the right or the left

81
 Chapter 5: Towing Your Boat and Maintaining Your Trailer
 
✓ Clenching one hand into a fist to indicate immediate stopping when the 
ball is under the trailer tongue
 
If your spotter isn’t experienced at hooking up the trailer, tell him or her to 
leave things alone and let you make the necessary connections.
The same old routine: Coupling the trailer 
securely to the vehicle
It pays to establish a routine (or even create a checklist) when hitching the 
trailer to your towing vehicle and to make it a strong habit through repeti-
tion. If you play it by ear each time and miss a step, you may see your boat 
and trailer pass you by on the highway. After your vehicle and trailer are 
aligned and in position (see the previous section), follow these steps:
 
1. Lower the trailer onto the ball by lowering the trailer jack.
 
2. Raise the tongue jack as high as possible so that the jack won’t hit 
bumps or train tracks while you’re driving.
 
3. Latch the ball socket by pulling down the hitch locking lever.
 
4. Put a padlock or the locking pin (if your trailer comes with a pin) 
through the hole on the latch.
 
 Either one will ensure that it doesn’t bounce open.
 
5. Hook up the safety chains.
 
 They should cross over each other under the tongue and connect to the 
safety chain loops near the hitch.
 
6. Hook up the brake cable, if your trailer has brakes.
 
 This thin cable is designed to jam on the trailer brakes if the hitch cou-
pling comes loose from the trailer.
 
7. Connect the trailer light plug on the trailer to the matching plug on 
the vehicle.
 
8. Have your spotter watch the trailer lights as you test the brakes, turn 
signals, and nighttime running lights.
 
9. Before driving away, make sure your vehicle mirrors are adjusted for 
optimum viewing. Without moving your head from side to side, you 
should be able to see the lanes next to you and your trailer tires in the 
side-view mirrors.
When all these steps are done, you’re ready to pull the trailer down the road.

82
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Pulling Your Trailer Safely 
and Efficiently
Most people don’t have much trouble pulling a boat-loaded trailer — the trick 
is backing it up (which I discuss in the next section). Just the same, pulling a 
trailer requires planning and caution. Pulling a trailer is a riskier activity than 
simply driving a vehicle; here are a few of the risks and how to account for 
them when towing your trailer and boat:
 
✓ Stopping a towing vehicle requires much longer distances. In fact, it 
takes at least twice as much distance as usual to stop a vehicle with a 
trailer in tow.
 
✓ Turning corners safely requires wide turns because the trailer follows 
a smaller arc than the vehicle. Turn as widely as you safely can to avoid 
scrubbing tires on curbs.
 
 One of the leading causes of trailer tire failure is scuffing tires on curbs — 
usually when turning corners too closely. So watch those turns!
 
✓ Acceleration is much slower due to the added weight. This means 
you’ll need to allow much more time for passing on a two-lane road (if 
the law and your nerves allow it) or for merging onto a highway.
 
Adding any weight or drag to your vehicle (and a trailer with a boat is a lot of 
weight and a big drag) also increases your fuel consumption. You can mini-
mize your fuel use by following these smooth trailer-towing tips:
 
✓ Map your route before you hit the road. This is more important than 
ever when you’re pulling a boat trailer. The last thing you want is to 
have to back out of a tight spot or travel a couple of extra cloverleaf 
highway interchanges to get back on track.
 
✓ Find a comfortable, easy highway pace, and hold it. Putting your vehi-
cle into cruise control is feasible with lighter loads. With heavy trailer 
loads, you should manage acceleration yourself, letting the rig slow 
down some while you accelerate just a little. Cruise control wants to 
maintain a steady speed and will really rev the engine on a hill or even 
gentle incline to make it happen.
 
✓ On dual-lane roads, stick to the right-hand lane — in fact, that’s the 
law for towing in some states. It’s easier and less stressful to let the 
traffic pass you by, anyway.

83
 Chapter 5: Towing Your Boat and Maintaining Your Trailer
 
✓ If the trailer starts to wag because of wind, take your foot off the gas 
until it settles down. Trailers add a significant amount of wind drag. 
You’ll feel it when driving in a crosswind or when an 18-wheeler passes 
you by.
 
✓ Stop frequently for fuel and to kick the tires. Touch the wheel hubs 
gingerly to make sure they aren’t overheating — that’s a sign of bearing 
problems from lack of grease. Make sure all chains and straps are tight.
Bring ’Er Back: Mastering Techniques 
for Backing Up a Trailer
Backing up your trailer is counterintuitive. In fact, trailers just seem down-
right contrary when all you want to do is launch the boat. You know what to 
do when backing up the vehicle alone, but do the same thing with a trailer 
and it goes in the opposite direction you expect. So I encourage you to forget 
everything you ever learned about backing up and follow the strategies I talk 
you through in this section.
You have a couple of methods to choose from when you’re backing up your 
trailer: You can either look over your shoulder or use the side mirrors. With 
both, there are some simple tricks to turning the steering wheel to make the 
trailer move where you want it to; here’s a hint: The key is where you place 
your hands on the steering wheel. If you follow the tricks exactly, they’ll work 
like a charm.
 
Whichever strategy you choose, have a spotter stand by to warn you if you 
approach an obstruction or if someone strays into your path. Also back up 
very slowly. In the long run, you’ll get the job done faster if you go slowly. At 
slow backing speeds, it’s easier to catch mistakes and steer to correct them. 
It’s also a lot easier to stop quickly if you’re moving slowly.
 
Practice backing up your trailer in an empty parking lot — maybe at the mall, 
but so far away from buildings that even Christmas shoppers wouldn’t park 
there.
When you can proficiently back your boat between the lines of two parking 
spots, you’re ready for the boat ramp. You’re aiming for success here, not 
perfection, and the ramp is often much wider than a parking slot, so don’t 
feel intimidated if you cross the lines slightly. In Chapter 6, I give you detailed 
tips for backing your boat and trailer down a ramp and into the water.

84
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Backing up while looking 
over your shoulder
Most drivers look over their shoulders when backing up in a vehicle, even 
without a trailer and boat attached. Follow these steps to accommodate the 
trailer and get it where you want it:
 
1. Put your left hand on top of the steering wheel, and look over your 
right shoulder toward the trailer tongue.
 
2. As you back up slowly, move your left hand in the direction you want 
your trailer to go.
Backing up while looking 
in the side mirrors
Some large trailers and boats obscure your view so much that it’s better to 
back up using the side mirrors. Follow these steps to back up your trailer 
using your vehicle’s side mirrors as a guide:
 
1. Put either hand on the bottom of the steering wheel, and watch the 
trailer wheels in either side-view mirror.
 
2. Move your hand in the direction you want your trailer to go.
Keeping Your Trailer Roadworthy
Anytime something gets wet repeatedly, you can expect to run into trouble 
with it. It’s one thing to drive your vehicle in the rain, but it’s another to back 
your trailer into the water until you submerge the lights, wheels, and brakes. 
As a result, things tend to rust, corrode, leak, and break. Boats are built to 
resist the effects of repeated soakings, but trailers aren’t. This section covers 
maintenance essentials to keep your trailer operating safely and extend its life.
Lighting and wiring are 
the first things to fail
Repeated flooding and drying will cause your trailer’s lighting wires to cor-
rode and light sockets to rust. Sometimes a hot light bulb even breaks due to 
a splash of cold water. This section includes suggestions for preventive main-
tenance and some tips on fixing lighting wires.

85
 Chapter 5: Towing Your Boat and Maintaining Your Trailer
Before you try to work on lighting wires, it helps to know which wire goes to 
what! It took me a long time to realize that all trailer wiring follows a specific 
color code — that is, if your trailer was wired by the factory or an expert. 
Table 5-1 translates the different colors of wires.
Table 5-1 
Trailer Wire Color Coding
Wire Color
What It Is or Connects To
White
Ground wire (completes the circuit for all the other connections)
Yellow
Right turn signal and brake light
Green
Left turn signal and brake light
Brown

Blue
Deactivates surge brakes (if you have them) when you put the 
vehicle in reverse. Because surge brakes work on pressure 
between the vehicle and trailer, this is an important connection 
when you’re backing up.
Lubricating your wiring connections
 
To help delay the onset of wiring problems in your trailer lights, follow these 
steps to do some preventative lubrication on the parts shown in Figure 5-2:
 
1. Locate the wire connections on the lights.
 
 They’re easy to spot: Look for wires leading to a screw head or wires 
joined with a plastic wire nut connection.
 
2. Lubricate the wiring connections on the lights with spray grease.
 
 Silicone spray grease does the best job of repelling water on these 
connections.
 
3. While you’re at it, you may as well remove the light bulbs and spray 
some lubrication into the light bulb sockets, too.
What to do when a single light doesn’t work
If a single light on your trailer doesn’t operate, most of the time the problem 
is in the light itself. Start by doing the easy thing: Replace the light bulb.
If the light still doesn’t work with a fresh bulb, the connections may be loose. 
You can often identify loose wiring connections by wiggling them while the 
lights are turned on. If the lights flicker on and off while they’re being wig-
gled, you’ve spotted the problem. Secure the wiring connections by twisting 
the screws on the terminal to which they’re attached.

86
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
If changing the light bulb and tightening wiring connections doesn’t solve 
your single light problem, you may need to take the trailer to the shop for 
additional service.
Tracking down the problem when all the lights go out
If all the trailer lights don’t work, the problem is most likely the white wire — 
the ground wire that connects the system to the battery (see Table 5-1 for an 
explanation of each color wire). Here’s what you do:
 
1. Find the white (ground) wire at the trailer light plug at the end of the 
trailer wiring harness by the trailer tongue.
 
2. Trace the wire to its connection on the trailer, and make sure it’s 
secure and undamaged. If it’s not secure, tighten it by following the 
instructions in the previous section.
 
3. If the wire is in good shape at its connection to the trailer, trace it 
from the vehicle plug to its connection with the vehicle wiring system, 
usually found under the bumper. Make sure it’s secure and undam-
aged at that location. If it’s not secure, tighten it by following the 
instructions in the previous section.
 
4. If the white wire is okay but the lights still don’t work, take your 
trailer to the shop for diagnosis and repair.
 
A test light from an automotive store is the handiest gadget to help find bad 
lighting wire connections. It looks like an ice pick with a clear light bulb in the 
handle and a black wire attached. You hook the black wire’s alligator clip to 
the vehicle or trailer, and then poke the ice pick into the connection you want 
to test (see Figure 5-2). If the problem is with the turn signal, the test light will 
blink in rhythm with your turn signal. If the problem is with the brake light, 
the test light will illuminate when you press the brake.

 Chapter 5: Towing Your Boat and Maintaining Your Trailer
Keeping those trailer wheels rolling
Trailer wheel bearings need grease periodically or they could start overheat-
ing and cause the wheel hub to actually fall off. And of course just like the 
tires on your vehicle, you need to keep a close eye on your trailer’s tire pres-
sure and tread wear.
Monitoring your wheel bearings
It’s a good idea to stop periodically when you tow and quickly touch the 
center of the trailer wheels to make sure they aren’t overheating. These 
center grease hubs get hot when they’re low on grease. When properly 
greased, they may feel very warm but not too hot to touch. When checking 
your wheel bearings, touch them quickly at first in case they really are hot.
 
If one or more of your hubs feels too hot to touch without burning your hand, 
call for service and stay put. If you drive any farther, you’ll have a breakdown.
To keep your wheel bearings maintained, stop by a service station annually 
and again before any long haul over 200 miles. Have the technicians inspect 
your wheel bearings and grease them.
 
If you prefer, you can do the work yourself and check the grease level in your 
trailer’s bearings. With a $20 grease gun, you can easily grease them by follow-
ing these steps (see Figure 5-3):
 
Figure 5-3:

grease to

88
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
1. Find the bearing grease fitting at the center of the wheel hub.
 
2. Press your finger against the fitting and try to rock it. If it doesn’t 
rock, it needs grease.
 
3. Snap the grease gun onto the fitting.
 
4. Squeeze grease into the fitting by pressing the grease gun lever. Be 
careful not to overfill it.
 
 You’ll actually see the grease fitting move toward you slightly as grease 
fills the bearing. You’ll know you’re done when it becomes slightly 
harder to squeeze the grease gun lever and you can rock the fitting.
Checking your tires
Of all the tasks in boat trailer maintenance, checking the tire pressure is 
the easiest and one of the most important. The loads on each trailer tire are 
extreme. Underinflated tires create unnecessary drag and can cause tire fail-
ure. You don’t want to see your boat worth thousands of dollars destroyed 
on the highway because of a blown trailer tire that could be replaced for less 
than $100! Here’s how to stay safe:
 
1. Find your tires’ maximum inflation pressure in the fine print around 
the rim of the tire.
 
2. Remove the stem cap — it’s just like the one on your car tires — and 
press the nozzle of a tire gauge onto the tire.
 
 You can either buy your own gauge or use the gauge on the gas station 
air pump.
 
3. If the tires are cool and haven’t been driven more than a couple of 
miles, underinflate them about five pounds per square inch below the 
maximum recommended pressure printed on the tires.
 
4. Check the air pressure again after you’ve driven long enough to warm 
the tires up — say 10 or 15 miles. If the pressure is high, let a little out 
by pressing the pin in the tire stem.
 
5. Recheck the air pressure on every trip to be sure the tires are main-
taining proper pressure.
 
Like your auto tires, trailer tires need to be replaced when signs of wear 
appear. Bald treads or uneven wear indicate they should be changed.
Making sure you can stop
 
Even if your towing vehicle has good brakes, failed boat trailer brakes could 
cause an accident by making the trailer jackknife when you try to stop or slow 
down.

89
 Chapter 5: Towing Your Boat and Maintaining Your Trailer
Your trailer brakes need an annual trip to the boat dealer or mechanic, who 
will make sure the calipers work freely, grease the moving parts, and check 
the pads. Technicians also will bleed any air out of the hydraulic lines and 
generally just make sure everything is up to standards.
Between annual servicing, refer to your trailer maintenance guide to keep 
the brakes in great shape. Here are two things you should consider doing 
regularly:
 
✓ Rinse salt off your brakes. After every time you use the trailer in salt 
water, make sure you rinse off your brakes with fresh water — a simple 
garden hose works great. Nothing destroys brakes faster than letting salt 
water evaporate in them, corroding and eroding them.
 
✓ Top off your brake fluid. It’s easy to check your brake fluid, and you 
should do so every few months to give yourself a heads up on impend-
ing brake failure. Here’s how to check and top off brake fluid:
 
1. Find the black cap on the fluid reservoir near the front end of 
the trailer.
 
2. Pry off the cap and look inside. The brake fluid should be near 
the top of the hole.
 
3. If the level is low, add brake fluid until the reservoir is full.
 
 If your brake fluid reservoir seems low, you should check it before every 
use to insure that the fluid isn’t leaking. If you find that you have to add 
fluid frequently, that’s a good indicator that professional service is in order.
Checking all the hardware regularly
Call me crazy, but I’m guessing you want your boat trailer to stay connected 
to your vehicle and your boat to stay on the trailer. Here’s some advice on 
checking your trailer hardware to keep your towing rig moving down the 
road safely (even if you do sometimes cross potholes and railroad tracks a 
little too roughly):
 
✓ Make sure the bow and transom straps are strong, not frayed, and 
drum-tight (not sagging even a little bit).
 
✓ Some trailers have both a bow strap and a safety chain on the bow. 
Use them both, and make sure they’re secure and not frayed.
 
✓ Inspect the eye bolts that hold the straps to make certain they’re strong.
 
✓ Inspect nuts and bolts all over the trailer, and tighten them with a 
socket wrench or an adjustable wrench if needed.
 
✓ Step on the ball hitch periodically and bounce up and down on it to 
make sure all connections are tight and secure. If you notice that it 
wobbles or seems loose in any way, take it to a hitch shop for inspection.

Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Getting Some Handy Trailer Gadgets
You can purchase several accessories to help ensure a soft landing when 
you return the boat to the trailer. (I discuss that whole process in Chapter 6.) 
These gadgets are generally not expensive and can make you look like a better 
boater than you actually are — kind of like oversized golf clubs do for golfers.
 
✓ Guide-ons are like goal posts on the end of your trailer (see Figure 5-4). 
They’re made of sturdy galvanized steel and covered with PVC pipe that 
won’t damage your boat when it rubs on them. With guide-ons installed 
and adjusted to the exact width of the boat, you can push the nose 
between them and they help you guide the boat right onto the center of 
the trailer.
 
✓ Center rollers protect the hull (see Figure 5-5). You attach them to 
the trailer to protect the boat’s keel and help guide it onto the trailer. 
I found some handy self-centering rollers manufactured by SeaSense 
(available at www.seasense.com) that feature a spiral groove to make 
the keel roll to the center as it passes over the rollers.
 
✓ Retractable transom straps are handy (see Figure 5-6) because they 
fasten to the back of the trailer and roll up when not in use. That keeps 
them handy and solves the security problem of where to store them.
Most of these gadgets are easy to install — each takes about 30 minutes 
with an adjustable wrench. And you don’t have to be particularly handy; just 
follow the directions that come with the accessories.
You can find many of these gadgets and more at several top online retailers 
of marine accessories. Some of the following Web sites also provide tips and 
instructions for installing and using gadgets:

Launching and Loading 
Your Trailered Boat
In This Chapter
▶ Brushing up on ramp etiquette and what to do before you hit the ramp
▶ Launching your boat with help or on your own
▶ Approaching the ramp to load up at the end of the day
▶ Loading your boat on the trailer and hitting the road
F
or some boaters, the music from the movie Jaws plays in their heads as 
they approach a boat ramp. Many have ended their enchantment with 
boating here, and more than a few have ended marriages or friendships at 
the ramp as well — and that’s only a slight exaggeration.
I won’t lie: The work of launching a boat from a trailer into the water and 
then loading it back up again is stressful, and it definitely doesn’t help when 
experienced boaters are around to watch — and sometimes critique — every 
move you make. However, you can greatly minimize this stress by being pre-
pared and knowing what to expect.
In this chapter, I walk you through the entire launching and loading process. 
I explain preparations you need make before you ever leave the house, and 
then give you the tactics to properly use the ramp without getting in the way 
of other boaters — and without ever doing anything that gets you featured on 
America’s Funniest Home Videos.
 
Getting your boat safely onto the ramp and into the water (and then back on 
the trailer later on) isn’t all that hard. You just have to understand the steps 
and tactics and follow them to a T. Much of the process is really common 
sense, there’s some courtesy involved, and the rest is a new skill you get to 
show off when you’ve given the process a little practice. But if you skip a step, 
things can go wrong. So, promise me you won’t skip a step.

Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Being a Prepared and Polite 
Boater at the Ramp
When you arrive at a boat-launching ramp, often there are many other boat-
ers at the ramp eager to get underway, too. Preparing your rig and crew for 
launching and finding your place in the launch ramp lineup isn’t hard, but 
you also need to be aware of some unwritten rules that, well, I’ve written 
down in this section. When followed, these rules for preparation and polite-
ness will draw goodwill and helpful assistance from other boaters when you 
need it.
 
A smooth launching experience comes from planning and preparation, and a 
major part of that preparation is practicing backing up your trailer, which I 
explain in Chapter 5.
Get it together at home
You can (and should) prepare for your launch even before you leave home. 
Being organized for the launch ramp takes some forethought about what 
you’ll need in the boat and what you’ll want your crew to do. Here are a few 
basic tips to keep in mind:
 
✓ Well before you leave for the ramp (preferably the day before), chat 
with your crew about the departure time and the return time. This 
information will help them determine what personal gear they’ll need. 
Remind them to collect things like sunscreen, towels, and a dry change 
of clothes in a bag before you meet.
 
✓ Pack your cooler of drinks and snacks at home, and load it onto the 
boat in the driveway, while there’s no pressure to move out of the 
way — like there is on the boat ramp. In Chapter 17 I give you some 
tips for packing a cooler for your crew.
 
 If you don’t have a cover on your boat, be sure to secure the cooler and 
anything in the boat that could blow away while you’re high-tailing it 
down the highway.
 
✓ Decide in advance who will back the boat down the ramp and into the 
water and who will manage the boat while the driver parks the vehi-
cle and trailer. Ideally, you’ll have a skipper who can back the boat off 
the trailer while you handle the vehicle and trailer, or you can captain 
the boat while someone else drives the vehicle. But if there’s no one to 
take the helm while you park, you can appoint someone to fasten a rope 
to the boat and hold onto it so the boat doesn’t float away while you 
park the vehicle.

95
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
Don’t be a ramp hog
One goal or benefit of preparation is minimizing the number of tasks you need 
to perform at the ramp before launching the boat, so you can maximize your 
fun. Another is to help you be quick about it so you don’t inconvenience the 
other boaters who are also trying to begin their boating quests. Inconsiderate 
people do things, such as pouring ice in the cooler or loading the tube or skis 
into the ski locker, on the ramp that they could have accomplished at home or 
in the boat-staging area that’s usually located near the ramp.
 
Follow these simple steps to launch without breaching the etiquette of the 
boat ramp:
 
1. Direct your crew where to wait for boarding.
 
2. Back the boat into the water.
 
3. Unleash the boat so your skipper or rope-holder can take it from 
there. Most ramps have a courtesy dock to which your helper should 
secure the boat.
 
4. Park your vehicle.
 
5. Rejoin your crew, load everyone in the boat, and take off.
Staging for Launch
Imagine you’re just about to loosen the bow strap that holds your boat to the 
trailer winch so that you can launch, when you realize you left the bilge plug 
out and your boat is filling with water. That mistake is frustrating for every-
body, but for you it’s both embarrassing and time-consuming, especially if 
you have to leave your place on the ramp, find the plug, and take a new place 
at the back of the line.
You can avoid scenarios like this one by following a preparation routine in 
the staging area near the ramp. Most ramps have a staging area where boat-
ers temporarily park with their trailered boats to make final preparations for 
launch. This is where you do the things you couldn’t do at home, like load 
beach towels or other items that may have blown out on the road if you’d 
loaded them earlier. It’s also where you do things you shouldn’t do until 
you’re ready to float the boat, like put in the bilge plug. You may want to jot 
down the following steps as a checklist and keep it handy when heading out 
for some time on the water.

96
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
Whenever you approach a new boat-launching area for the first time, it pays to 
take a look around before you dive right in. Park your rig out of the way and 
walk over to the ramp. Watch how the other boaters take their place in line or 
pull up to the staging area and prep their boats. After you have the full picture 
and a feel for the local customs, ease into the process, beginning at the staging 
area with the following steps:
 
1. Put the bilge plug in!
 
 Very few boaters can claim that they haven’t forgotten this at least once 
in their boating careers. If you forget to put in the bilge plug, your first 
sign of a problem will be a jet of water streaming from the bilge pump 
outlet on the side of your boat as you back your trailer down the ramp. 
You either have to load the leaking boat back onto the trailer to drain it 
and plug it, or swim to the back of the boat to install the plug and let the 
bilge pump remove the water.
 
 I’ve heard of a number of unique ways to remember to install the bilge 
plug. Some boaters keep the plug with the boat keys, and others tape 
the plug to the winch handle so they automatically spot it as they pre-
pare to launch. You may want to try these or come up with a trick of 
your own.
 
2. Disconnect and remove the transom straps, and lock them in your tow 
vehicle. (You’ll find a full discussion of straps in Chapter 5.)
 
 Launching lore is full of funny but probably phony stories of green boat-
ers who called mechanics and complained they couldn’t get their boats 
up to speed. The mechanics’ cursory examinations revealed the boaters 
had left the trailers attached to the boats and disconnected the trail-
ers from the vehicles. The staging area is the only safe place to remove 
these straps. Your first sign of forgetting this step is that the boat 
doesn’t float off the trailer when you release the bow strap.
 
3. Loosen the bow winch (see Figure 6-1) just enough so that the strap 
has a few inches of slack.
 
 Forgetting this step usually isn’t the end of the world, but sometimes the 
boat is held so tightly to the front of the trailer that it becomes difficult 
to loosen the bow winch after you back the boat into the water.
 
 The bow winch is the device on your trailer with a hand crank and a 
spool of nylon strapping. The strap hooks to the boat, and when you 
turn the crank, it pulls the boat snug onto the trailer. A small lever on or 
near the strap spool reverses the cranking direction so you can let the 
strapping out to launch.
 
4. Attach fenders and docklines.
 
 If the boat-launching ramp has more than one courtesy dock and you’re 
not sure which one you’ll use, it’s best to keep your options open by 
putting at least two fenders on each side of the boat (I discuss fenders in 

97
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
Chapter 4). Courtesy docks are often located at ramps to provide tempo-
rary mooring while parking the trailer. They ease loading and unloading 
passengers.
 
 Attach a line to the bow cleat and one to each cleat near the transom 
at the back of the boat, too. With those in place, you won’t have to 
scramble to put them in place later, and you can safely moor the boat to 
the courtesy dock while you park the vehicle and trailer. (Find out more 
about mooring lines in Chapter 4.)
 
5. Load any last-minute gear.
 
 This gear may include the beach towels, the chart, or everyone’s per-
sonal gear bags. Stow everything safely, and have the crew wait by the 
courtesy dock near the ramp or somewhere else safe and handy while 
the boat is launched.
 
6. Turn on the battery switch, if you have one.
 
Figure 6-1:
 A bow

(when 
launching) 
or wind 
(when 
loading).
 
 
7. Double-check the battery charge level by turning on the key just long 
enough to hear the engine fire, and then quickly turn it off.
 
 Don’t let the engine run more than a second or two out of the water; 
doing so could damage the engine’s water pump impeller and eventually 
the engine if it runs long enough to overheat.
 
• If your boat is an outboard, tilt the engine up and disengage the 
engine trailering support bracket by swinging it toward the boat. 
The bracket should be right near the pivot point on which your 

98
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
engine tilts, and disengaging it allows you or your skipper to easily 
trim the motor down into the water when your boat is on the ramp.
 
• If your boat is a sterndrive, the drive mechanism won’t have a 
supporting bracket. The trim mechanism holds it up in the traile-
ring position. If that’s not the case, tilt it up in the staging area so 
you don’t damage it on the ramp.
After you follow these steps, you’re ready to get in line to launch your boat. 
If you haven’t already, it pays to take a good look around to get a feel for how 
things flow and how the lines form. It’s also a good time to have everyone 
visit the restroom facilities, if some are available at the ramp.
 
On the downward slope of the ramp, many boaters use wheel chocks, which 
are simply blocks of wood they put behind their vehicle tires to prevent it 
from rolling backwards should the brakes fail. If you have wheel chocks to use 
when launching, get them out and ready to go while you’re in the staging area. 
I have a pair tied together with a rope; I put one under the left wheel, stretch 
the rope over the bumper hitch and put the other under the right wheel. When 
I drive away after launching, the chocks drag harmlessly under the center of 
the trailer until I get to flat ground and stow them.
 
You may be tempted to let your crew climb into the boat while it’s still in the 
staging area, but don’t load your crew until after you launch. No matter how 
convenient it may seem, it’s just not safe to put everyone in the boat before 
the boat is safely away from the trailer and in the water. There’s still a small 
danger of the boat coming disconnected from the trailer or the trailer coming 
disconnected from the vehicle. And you may be surprised to hear that more 
than one flustered boater has backed the entire truck and trailer fully under-
water by confusing reverse and forward or forgetting to set the vehicle’s emer-
gency brake.
Sizing Up the Boat Ramp 
to Tailor Your Technique
I wish I could tell you that I back my trailer to the perfect depth every time I 
launch or load up my boat on the trailer. If I were to use the same ramp every 
time, maybe I could do that. But one weekend I’ll use a steep ramp at a favor-
ite fishing hole, another weekend I’ll use a shallow ramp at my favorite lake, 
and still another I’ll find myself at a ramp on a river with a 5-mile per hour 
current sweeping past. Each one takes a different approach and presents 
different challenges. In truth, you have to go through some trial and error to 
find the sweet spot for launching or loading your boat, and it may vary from 
place to place.

99
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
In this section, I give you some tips to minimize your learning curve and 
make backing your trailer down a ramp for launching or loading an easy chal-
lenge to conquer.
 
No matter what kind of ramp you’re using, the trailer driver should always 
follow these steps after the trailer is backed into the water:
 
1. If the vehicle has an automatic transmission, put it in Park. If it’s a 
manual, put it in Reverse.
 
2. Turn off the vehicle.
 
3. Set the emergency brake.
 
4. Put chocks behind the rear wheels as insurance in case the emergency 
brake fails or the vehicle pops out of gear. If your rear wheels are in 
the water, as is sometimes the case, put chocks under the front wheels 
as an alternative.
 
5. Double-check everything!
 
6. If you’re launching alone, park quickly and trot back to the boat. If 
you’re loading alone, get back to your boat as soon as you can after 
the vehicle is secure on the ramp.
Mastering a shallow ramp
The easiest ramps are the shallow ones with a gentle slope. They make it 
easy to launch and load the boat from and to the trailer. A shallow ramp 
that’s just right is a treat. You know you’ve got a beauty if, when the rear 
bumper of your vehicle is stopped at the waterline, the tops of the trailer 
tires are just about even with the surface of the water. However, sometimes a 
shallow ramp can be too shallow.
When launching and loading on a shallow ramp that’s at the proper shallow 
depth, the trailer bunks or rollers on which your boat rests should be mostly 
underwater, which makes it easy for the boat to slide off the trailer, or in the 
case of loading, to nudge the bow of your boat right up on the trailer. When 
the ramp’s too shallow, you need to back your vehicle’s back wheels into the 
water to get the trailer bunks and wheels underwater. Getting your vehicle’s 
wheels wet isn’t a problem, but traction may be an issue; if you get a chance, 
watch others pull out their boats on such a ramp to see if they have trouble 
getting traction. Usually a shallow ramp poses no such risk, but anytime you 
get your vehicle’s wheels in the water, they can sometimes slip on marine 
growth on the ramp. (For details on what to do in this case, see the section, 
“Getting Up a Slippery Ramp,” later in this chapter.)

100
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Meeting the challenge of a deep ramp
Deep ramps are usually a welcome sight to boaters because the depth often 
allows you to get your boat fully into the water without wetting your vehicle’s 
rear wheels — something I try to avoid when I can. Deep ramps also minimize 
the risk of striking the bottom with the prop as you push the boat up on the 
trailer or back it off.
For the purposes of launching or loading your boat onto the trailer, a deep 
and steep ramp is great as long as it isn’t so steep that your vehicle struggles 
to pull itself and the boat up the incline to level ground. Your first concern at 
a ramp like this isn’t getting the trailer wet enough for an easy load but rather 
getting the loaded trailer and vehicle to go up the ramp. I talk about that in 
the section, “Getting Up a Slippery Ramp,” later in this chapter.
Immersing your trailer to a workable depth on a steep ramp is pretty easy. 
Back it in until just the tops of the trailer wheels are out of the water. This 
puts the bunks or rollers under the water at a steeper loading angle that 
requires the boat to take a pretty gingerly approach to the trailer, because 
your boat’s stem — the peak of the bow — will nose into the bunks instead 
of having more of the bottom engage the bunks. (I discuss how a boat 
approaches the ramp and trailer in more detail later in this chapter in the 
section, “Approaching the trailer.”) When launching, take care to keep the 
bow strap attached to the trailer winch. If you don’t the boat could slide off 
the trailer onto the concrete before it reaches the water.
Combating a crosscurrent on the ramp
A ramp with a crosscurrent is the toughest of all ramps to negotiate, mainly 
when loading your boat. Launching isn’t impacted much because the boat 
stays firm on the trailer until you take it off and away from the trailer. In 
loading, though, the current makes landing the boat like an aircraft carrier 
landing — almost like aiming at a moving target. A strong crosswind with no 
current can offer a similar challenge.
Aim the trailer with the current at as sharp an angle as the ramp and the 
depth of the water allow. Scan the water for obstacles, because the angle of 
the trailer requires the boat to come in at an angle when launching, and you 
don’t want that path to cross rocks or stumps if you can avoid it. When the 
trailer driver aims the trailer downstream, the boat handler can approach 
the trailer by driving the boat more directly into the current, giving him or 
her more control of the boat than with a following current or a perpendicular 
crosscurrent.

101
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
 
Stop backing the trailer down the ramp when it’s a little shallower than you 
would be on ramps with no current. By leaving the trailer bunks a little higher, 
they engage the boat sooner, giving added control when the boat handler 
nudges the boat into them. If you find the trailer is too shallow to finish load-
ing, you can quickly back in a couple of more feet while the boat handler holds 
the boat in the trailer with a little throttle.
Launching Your Boat with a Crew
Chances are you didn’t buy your boat to boat alone, so you’ll have friends or 
family with you when facing the tasks of launching from and loading onto a 
trailer. It’s the social nature of boating that actually makes it fun, and you can 
enhance that by engaging your crew in the tasks of boating — starting with 
launching the boat. But engaging them safely and without seeming to be a 
Captain Bligh may make this the trickiest part of launching — even more than 
skillfully backing the trailer into the water.
Loading safely and engaging the crew is mostly about good communication 
and teamwork in executing the tasks I outline for you in this section. I lay 
down some guidelines with the assumption that you have at least one other 
boater who can help you by handling the boat as it’s launched.
You may be boating with guests or family, all with varying degrees of familiar-
ity with the launching process. In short, you have three categories of crew: a 
person who handles the boat, a person who handles the vehicle and trailer, 
and guests or children who wait while the boat is launched. I assume you’ll 
fall into one of the first two categories, especially after reading this book.
The boat handler
Whether it’s you or a skipper you appoint, this person is responsible for get-
ting the boat safely off the ramp and into the water — or if he or she isn’t 
comfortable driving the boat, holding a rope attached to the boat so that it 
doesn’t float away while you park the vehicle and trailer.
Here’s how to proceed with a boat handler who can drive the boat:
 
1. Before you get started, the boat handler and the vehicle driver need 
to agree in advance when the boat handler will start the boat engine.
 
 The best time is usually just before the driver disconnects the bow 
strap, releasing the boat from the trailer.

102
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
2. The boat handler boards the boat only as it’s about to be backed into 
the water. The vehicle driver stops at the water’s edge and lets the 
boat handler climb in.
 
3. The boat handler tilts the propeller down far enough to get it fully 
into the water.
 
 In addition to enabling the propeller to make the boat move, this task 
also ensures that cool water flows through the propeller drive shaft 
housing, so the water pump impeller doesn’t burn up.
 
4. The boat handler guides the driver, signaling him or her when the 
boat is in the water far enough to submerge the propeller.
 
5. The handler starts the boat engine and signals the driver when it’s 
running smoothly.
 
 At this point, the driver is standing at the bow winch, ready to release 
the boat. This signal is important because the driver may not be able to 
hear the boat’s motor, especially if the vehicle’s engine is idling.
 
6. The boat handler waits for the driver’s signal that it’s safe to put the 
engine in reverse and back the boat off the trailer.
 
 The driver gives this signal after disconnecting the bow strap.
 
7. If it takes much more than idle speed propeller force in reverse to 
move the boat off the trailer, the boat handler should hold the idle 
speed steady while the driver backs the trailer down a little farther to 
let the boat float off.
 
8. The boat handler loads the crew, not forgetting the driver, who may 
have had to park waaaaaayyyy back in the lot.
If you need to drive the vehicle and you don’t have a skipper who can actu-
ally drive the boat, here’s how one of your passengers can help launch the 
boat by serving as a makeshift boat handler:
 
1. Attach a long line to one of the bow or front cleats on the boat.
 
2. Give the rope to the stand-in handler to hold tightly onshore as you 
back the trailer into the water.
 
3. Stop the vehicle, and disconnect the bow strap to float the boat free.
 
 Be sure the stand-in handler is stout enough to arrest the boat’s drift 
while standing on the shore. You don’t want him or her accidentally 
pulled into the water by the boat’s momentum!
 
4. The handler uses the rope to control the boat while you park the vehi-
cle and trailer.

103
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
The vehicle driver
Whether it’s you or someone else, the vehicle driver has the most difficult job 
in the launch process until the boat is fully in the water. Nothing in boating is 
more eventful than backing the trailer down the ramp (I discuss backing-up 
techniques in Chapter 5). Here’s how the driver’s job should stack up:
 
1. The driver and boat handler decide on a pickup point so the driver 
can meet the boat after parking the trailer.
 
2. While the passengers wait safely on the sidelines, the driver should 
have the boat handler ride in the vehicle as they approach the ramp.
 
3. The driver lines up the rig in the launch lane and backs down the 
ramp until the boat is about to enter the water.
 
4. The driver stops and lets the boat handler climb into the boat (or, if 
the boat handler isn’t going to drive the boat, the driver ties a rope 
onto it for the handler to hold while onshore).
 
5. The driver checks that the boat handler is settled behind the boat’s 
wheel and backs the boat farther into the water until the trailer 
wheels are nearly covered by water, as seen using the side rearview 
mirrors.
 
 Nearly submerging the trailer wheels is usually the best depth for 
unloading the boat, but some ramps have different angles and often 
require the wheels to be deeper or shallower. Figure 6-2 shows the most 
common proper trailer depth.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Usually the 
best trailer 
depth for

is when the

104
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
6. The driver stops the vehicle, puts it in Park, and sets the emergency 
brake as firmly as possible.
 
 To prevent a mishap, the driver should double-check these settings 
before leaving the driver’s seat.
 
7. The driver puts wheel chocks behind the vehicle wheel(s) (if chocks 
are being used).
 
8. The driver signals the boat handler that everything’s ready for launch, 
and the boat handler signals back when the boat’s engine is running.
 
9. The driver disconnects the boat from the trailer by unhooking the 
bow strap.
 
10. If the boat doesn’t come off the trailer easily, the driver removes the 
chocks and backs a little farther down the ramp until the boat floats 
free.
 
11. The driver parks the vehicle and trailer, checks for any items left in 
the vehicle that may be needed on the boat, locks the vehicle, and 
then boards the boat at the predetermined meeting spot.
Guests and kids who board after launch
Those in your crew who don’t have an active role in launching still need 
to know where to wait and what to do while the process is taking place. 
Coach them along the following steps to board from a courtesy dock, and 
do it with your best manners on display. Launching is often stressful for 
everyone, and what you think may be gentle suggestions can come across 
as grumpy commands.
 
1. The crew gathers up any last-minute personal items and hangs onto 
them.
 
2. The crew waits for the boat on the courtesy dock.
 
 Although it may seem handy to have crew members help moor the boat 
at the courtesy dock, make sure they know that docking will go more 
smoothly if they don’t reach out and try to push or pull the boat as it 
approaches the dock. Doing so may result in their injury or make the 
boat land harder than it would have without their help.
 
3. The crew boards the boat only after it’s secured to the courtesy dock.
 
 Ever watch those boating bloopers on TV where everyone falls into the 
water? Nearly all those boats weren’t secured to the dock while the crew 
boarded.

105
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
 
The launching process is the same even if there’s no courtesy dock — it just 
isn’t as convenient to handle the boat while parking or loading passengers. 
Here are a few suggestions to handle this occasional situation:
 
✓ If you can, move and secure the boat away from the launching ramp 
before you park your vehicle.
 
✓ Beach the boat if the nearby shoreline isn’t too rocky. Sandy shores 
and even fine pea gravel or grassy shores are usually safe for beaching 
a boat. To beach the boat, trim up the engine as far as possible while 
keeping the prop in the water, and nudge the boat onto the beach with 
little “bumps” of the gearshift in and out of forward gear.
 
✓ Hold the boat off the shore if it’s so rocky that beaching could damage 
your boat.
 
✓ If you suspect you’ll be launching at a ramp without a courtesy dock and 
you know the spot has a rocky, unbeachable beach, let your crew know 
that they should be prepared to wade into the water in order to board 
the boat.
Launching Your Boat Alone
Sometimes boaters go it alone. Fishermen in particular tend to head out 
alone and often find themselves having to fill the roles of driver and boat 
handler. Getting past the hurdle of launching alone isn’t hard if you plan your 
approach after scanning the ramp area to see what you have to work with.
Swimmer’s solo launch
On a calm summer morning, I watched a guy 
prep his boat for launching. I was ready to offer 
my assistance, but he charged down to the 
ramp, circled his rig, and backed in smartly, 
plunging the boat in the water. It left the trailer 
with such momentum that it drifted out 50 yards 
while the boater parked his rig. Moments later, 
he raced down the ramp, executed a flat racer’s 
dive, and swam to the boat in seconds.
This guy had the stamina and training for the 
swim, but many boaters think they can swim to 
a drifting boat and find it’s farther away than 
they thought. Every year, boaters drown when 
they underestimate the swimming distance to 
their boats. Or they may undertake the swim 
and then find that the boat moves in the force 
of current or wind, carrying it farther out of 
reach and the swimmer farther from the safety 
of shore.

106
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Follow these steps to launch your boat alone:
 
1. Prep your boat in the staging area just like you would with a crew, as I 
describe earlier in this chapter. Install the bilge plug, remove the tran-
som straps, tilt your propeller up to avoid dinging it on the ramp, and 
load any final gear into the boat.
 
2. Put fenders on both sides of your boat near the front and back to pro-
tect the boat from the dock.
 
3. Select a rope from your gear that’s long enough to reach from the bow 
of your boat to the courtesy dock after you back the boat down the 
ramp but before you take it off the trailer. Fasten this rope, the bow-
line, to a deck cleat on the front or bow on the side nearest the cour-
tesy dock.
 
4. Tie the other end of the bowline to your trailer winch, hitch, or some 
other convenient fastening point. Leave the coiled end in the boat. It 
will pay out as the boat drifts off the trailer.
 
5. Back your boat carefully down the ramp, keeping it near enough to the 
courtesy dock to reach it with the rope you just fastened on the bow.
 
6. Stop backing in before you wouldn’t be able to reach the rope without 
getting your feet wet.
 
7. Put the vehicle in Park, set the emergency brake, untie the end of the 
bowline on the vehicle or trailer, and walk onto the courtesy dock. 
Attach the bowline to a dock cleat past the transom or back of the 
boat.
 
8. Return to the boat and trailer, and unhook the bow strap.
 
9. Get behind the wheel of the vehicle and back the boat farther into 
the water quickly enough to cause it to drift back until the bowline 
becomes taught and stops its drift.
 
10. Carefully snug your boat to the courtesy dock using the procedure I 
discuss in Chapter 8.
 
11. Park your vehicle and trailer, and return to your boat.
 
If there’s no courtesy dock and you’re launching alone, you have two options:
 
✓ Beach the boat on a sandy or grassy shore by trimming up the engine 
as far as possible while keeping the prop in the water, and nudge the 
boat onto the beach with little “bumps” of the gearshift in and out of 
forward gear.
 
✓ Use your anchor line for the bowline, and set the anchor on the shore 
to let the boat drift back on the line until you return from parking. Then 
haul it in toward the shore and climb in.

107
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
Either way, you should come to the water prepared to wade, either barefoot 
or with water shoes or rubber boots if the water is cold.
Time to Go Home: Getting Your 
Turn in the Loading Line
After you’ve had a ball on the water all day, you’re apt to feel like loading 
your boat back onto the trailer is no big deal. You’d be mostly right. Loading 
your boat is different from launching it but definitely not harder. On the other 
hand, you’re probably a little fatigued by the wind and the sun and the fun. 
All that has taken a toll on your body and brain, making you a little sluggish 
and maybe a little irritable. When it comes to loading up at the end of the 
day, one of the most difficult things to master may not be the mechanics of 
backing your trailer into the water or loading your boat and hitting the road. 
Instead, it may be coordinating with the other boaters to courteously find 
your spot in the apparent chaos of the ramp line.
On weekends, unless you’ve found a hidden jewel of a ramp, there will be 
some traffic waiting to load up when you’re ready to load your boat. Your 
goal is to find your place in the line, wait your turn, and get your boat out of 
the water as quickly as possible so the next guy can get his or hers out. Doing 
this safely without irritating the other boaters requires communication and 
astute observation. In this section, I tell you how to read the ramp so you 
know when it’s your turn and how to approach things when it is.
Anchors aweigh
One morning at a photo shoot, long before the 
coffee kicked in, I watched a lone angler back 
down the ramp. He did it quickly and efficiently 
before my sluggish reflexes prompted me to 
offer assistance. He backed the boat in, put his 
vehicle in Park, and set the emergency brake. 
He disconnected the bow strap and then pulled 
an anchor from the bow and tossed it aside, 
leaving the rope coiled on the boat, tied to a 
cleat. He jumped back in the vehicle, backed 
the boat in sharply, giving it some backward 
inertia, and as it floated free he charged off to 
the parking lot. The boat drifted to the end of the 
anchor rope and stopped, waiting for his return. 
He reeled in the boat, climbed aboard, and went 
fishin’.
It wasn’t a bad launching strategy and it had 
probably worked many times, but the boat could 
have had a little too much inertia and dragged 
the anchor down the ramp, forcing the angler to 
wade in to retrieve it.

108
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
Whenever boaters are waiting at a busy ramp, stay focused and be as quick 
about tasks as you can be. If you’re stopping to rummage around for the keys 
you should have already had in hand, wash the sunscreen off your face, or dig 
the last soda out of the bottom of the cooler, you’re discourteously holding up 
other boaters.
Figuring out what’s going on 
around the loading line
As the boat handler — whether that’s you or a crew member — guides the 
boat toward the ramp, you’re likely to see boats idling around it, boats tied 
to the courtesy dock (if the ramp has one), vehicles with trailers queued up 
to back into the water and grab their boats, and some trailers already in the 
water with boats in the process of loading. You probably don’t see much 
order to all this as you approach the ramp, and in fact, there are probably 
a few other boaters who don’t see much order to it either. What’s going 
on? Well, it’s a bit of a mess and somewhat of a guess, but I’ll try my best to 
explain:
 
✓ Idling boaters: Boaters circling their boats outside the ramp area are 
probably either waiting for a spot at the courtesy dock (if the ramp has 
one) or, having already dropped off passengers at the courtesy dock, 
are now waiting for their trailer drivers to get the trailers. When such a 
boater sees his or her trailer coming, expect him or her to make a bee-
line to the ramp. Stay out of the way; it’s his or her turn.
Juggling act
Somebody suggested a lone angler tie a long 
rope to the front of the boat and stretch it for-
ward to the driver’s seat of the tow vehicle. 
Unhooking the bow strap was the next step. 
Then, holding the rope in one hand, the sugges-
tion was that the boater back down the ramp 
until the boat floated free and he wrangled it 
while trying to put the vehicle in Park and set 
the emergency brake.
I can’t recall seeing this solo-launching method 
in action, but for most people, backing a trailer 
is like patting your head and rubbing your 
tummy. Adding one more management problem 
to the mix seems impractical to me. What does 
work, though, is tying the long rope to the trailer 
and letting it uncoil as the boat drifts away. You 
have time to set the brake, put the transmission 
in Park, pull the boat to the beach or courtesy 
dock, secure it, and then park your vehicle.

109
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
 
✓ Boats at the courtesy dock: If your ramp has a courtesy dock, you’re 
likely to see some boats there unloading passengers. Unoccupied boats 
tied to the courtesy docks should be left there only while a boater who 
doesn’t have a partner to drive the trailer retrieves the trailer to load 
up. If a boat’s occupants are onshore playing softball or volleyball while 
their boat takes up space at the courtesy dock and perhaps even blocks 
the ramp, they could — and should — get a ticket.
 
✓ Boats loading up at the ramp: Whether acting alone or with help from a 
partner, getting a boat onto the trailer and out of the water takes some 
maneuvering. As soon as one trailer is pulled out of the water and driven 
safely away, the next vehicle in the trailer line backs into its spot.
 
✓ Boats in the staging area: When a boat is secured to its trailer, the 
driver quickly whisks it away to the staging area away from the hustle 
and bustle of the ramp. As I explain in the section, “Staging for Launch,” 
earlier in this chapter, the staging area is specifically designated for 
readying your boat to launch or for making final preparations to tow it 
on the highway. Activities done there include making sure the boat is 
secured to its trailer, rinsing down the boat if water is handy, and stow-
ing loose gear so it doesn’t blow away on the road.
Offloading passengers and 
getting into position
After the boat handler understands what’s going on around the ramp, it’s 
time to make a move. Handling this situation is an exercise in finesse, good 
manners, and mind-reading because there’s no one directing traffic. Here’s 
how you can seize the moment as the boat handler without forgetting your 
manners:
 
1. Pull up to the courtesy dock and secure the boat to it, or beach the 
boat if there’s no courtesy dock. If the shore is rocky, you may want to 
have someone hold the boat afloat in shallow water to avoid chipping 
the bottom on the rocks.
 
 When a space at the courtesy dock opens and no boater in the area 
before you goes for it, you can ease that way. If you have to squeeze past 
another boat, make sure it’s waiting for a trailer and not a place at the 
courtesy dock. Ask if the other boaters mind if you offload passengers 
and a driver. If they indicate that they too are waiting for the courtesy 
dock, back out and signal them ahead.
 
 Before you approach the courtesy dock, put out fenders on the side of 
the boat you intend to dock on to keep your boat from being scratched 
up, and tie at least two lines on your cleats for securing the boat to the 
dock. For further instructions on docking, turn to Chapter 8.

110
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
 If there’s no courtesy dock, wait your turn to gently beach the boat 
near the ramp. When you beach the boat, pick an area with the soft-
est bottom; chunky rock bottoms will damage your boat. If it’s a rocky 
bottom, you may want to have someone step in the water to hold the 
boat off the bottom. Do this only after the boat engine has been turned 
off, and trim your propeller up as much as you can without lifting it out 
of the water.
 
 If you’re going solo: If you’re handling the boat and trailer alone, tie 
your boat to the dock as far away from the ramp as possible so other 
boaters can get through to the ramp while you retrieve the trailer. 
Remember, there are probably boats milling around waiting for their 
trailers to come to the water. If you block the ramp while you retrieve 
your own trailer, you may as well have cut in line. In some smaller ramp 
areas, blocking the ramp may be inevitable, so give the trailers in line a 
chance to load up before you dock in the loading lane.
 
2. Secure the crew.
 
 When the boat is safely docked or beached, the crew and trailer driver 
get off the boat. Have the crew settle down somewhere safely nearby to 
wait until the boat is on the trailer, and make sure someone’s supervis-
ing any kids in the group.
 
3. Release the boat from the dock and take it back out.
 
 After passengers are offloaded, you take the boat back out into the 
water to await the trailer.
 
4. The driver retrieves the trailer.
 
 If the trailer driver takes anyone else with him or her up to the trailer, 
that’s fine. But when the driver’s turn at the ramp comes up, passengers 
should get out of the car and step to a safer place onshore until the load-
ing is done.
 
5. The driver gets in line for the ramp.
 
 The driver drives the vehicle and trailer to the end of the line of vehicles 
waiting for their turn at the ramp. Meanwhile, the boat handler is idling 
the boat out in the water, waiting for the trailer.
 
 If you’re going solo: If blocking the ramp was inevitable when you 
docked at the courtesy dock in order to retrieve your trailer, the other 
boaters probably want you to skip ahead and load your boat. It doesn’t 
hurt to communicate with the first couple of drivers in the lineup and 
get their go-ahead.
When the trailer driver’s turn comes, the next step is backing the trailer 
down the ramp so you can load the boat. Backing the trailer down to load the 
boat is basically the same as backing it in to launch the boat, which I cover 
earlier in this chapter.

111
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
Loading Your Boat on the Trailer
It seems like there are more horror stories about boat loading gone crazy 
than boat launching gone crazy. Learning to apply just the right amount of 
throttle to ease the boat onto the trailer comes with a lot of room for error. 
In this section, I give the boat handler some tips on approaching the trailer, 
handling current and wind, and managing engine speed for a perfect landing. 
To make things easier, I assume the boat handler is you.
Approaching the trailer
In a perfect world, your trailer is submerged on a ramp that lets the boat 
coast onto the trailer bunks with no throttle, perfectly aligned with the center 
of the trailer and with nothing to push you off your course. The front of your 
boat meets the trailer’s bow roller and winch with a gentle kiss.
Sounds too good to be true, and sometimes it is. But landing perfectly isn’t 
as important as landing safely without damaging your boat. The following 
sections have some pointers to make your landings safe and snug and, more 
often than not, perfect as well.
Sizing up the wind and water conditions
To land your boat perfectly on the trailer, you need to know what you’re up 
against with regard to the conditions of wind, water, and current. Accurately 
assessing them is crucial to managing them with throttle and steering adjust-
ments. Here’s what to watch for:
 
✓ Drift: Approach the trailer from a distance at an idle speed, and stop one 
or two boat lengths away from the trailer. Note how quickly or slowly 
the wind or current causes the boat to drift off the path that would 
center it on the trailer.
 
✓ Current: Look for swirling water on one side or the other of the trailer. 
This is a sign that current is moving past it, and you have to adjust your 
course upstream to compensate for it.
 
✓ Chop: If the ramp you’re using is tucked in a quiet cove, you don’t have 
to worry about chop. If the ramp is out in the open, exposed to boat traf-
fic and wakes, you have to take chop into consideration when loading. 
If wakes from other boats meet your trailer at the same time your boat 
does, you’re in for a bumpy landing. Let passing boats pass and wait for 
their wakes to dissipate before you aim for the trailer.

112
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Determining the right speed
The right boat speed is critical when approaching your trailer to load up. 
Misjudging the speed of the approach and using too much or too little 
throttle is the key cause of bumpy landings. Here are your three options, 
Goldilocks:
 
✓ Coming in too hot (quickly): Driving your boat to the trailer with too 
much speed causes the boat to bounce around in the trailer bunks, 
which can sometimes damage the boat and even the trailer. Almost 
as bad, landing too quickly looks pretty embarrassing. It’s better to 
approach too slowly than too quickly.
 
✓ Coming in too cold (slowly): Bringing your boat in without enough 
speed lets wind drift or current take over for you, and these two forces 
aren’t usually on your team. They work to push the boat out of align-
ment with the trailer. However, coming in too slowly is absolutely easier 
to correct — and less likely to damage your boat — than coming in too 
quickly. You can always pop it in Reverse and back out again for another 
try. Pulling a mulligan — you golfers will know what I mean — is some-
times all you need to learn to adjust your speed for the conditions you 
face on any loading attempt.
 
✓ Coming in just right: The ideal loading speed is, unfortunately, a matter 
of trial and error. Coming onto the trailer even at idle is usually about 4 
or 5 miles per hour, and that’s too fast. You want to make only enough 
headway to steer the boat, which means you’re shifting from Neutral to 
Forward and back to keep the speed just high enough to steer the boat.
 
If two people are working together to load the boat, as the boat approaches 
the trailer, the trailer driver can help the boat driver manage speed and direc-
tion by using a thumbs up or down and gestures right or left for more or less 
speed and course corrections. The driver can stand on the ramp with his or 
her hands overhead so the boat handler can see the signals.
Overcoming steering challenges
Steering the boat at the low speed required for loading presents some new 
challenges, and meeting them requires the experience that comes with time. 
Two common steering challenges are
 
✓ Wandering course: At slow speeds, your boat probably wanders to the 
left and right of your steered course, but over a distance it probably 
stays roughly on course (I talk more about wandering in Chapter 7). If 
the effect of wandering is great enough to risk missing the center of the 
trailer, you may need to correct for it by steering against the oscilla-
tions. It takes timing and a little intuition, but as you get to know your 
boat, you’ll be able to anticipate it wandering to the left and steer to the 
right (and vice versa) before it happens.

113
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
 
✓ Overcorrecting: As a new boater, you aren’t alone in expecting your 
boat to react to the steering wheel like your car does. When you see or 
feel the boat veer slightly off course, you want to correct, and when you 
correct slightly, nothing happens, so you correct some more. Boats take 
time to react to steering inputs. Give each steering correction a second 
or two to take effect before you add more.
 
With a two-man loading crew, as the boat approaches the trailer, the trailer 
driver can give the boat driver directional guidance by pointing to the right or 
left, whichever way the boat needs to go to meet the center of the trailer. It’s 
often hard for the boat handler to judge when the boat is centered from the 
helm, so the guidance is usually appreciated.
Dealing with a strong current or wind
Landing your boat in a crosscurrent is daunting the first time you do it. Most 
public ramps seem to be well located to avoid that situation, but I find a 
nasty one out there often enough that I think a little special coaching on the 
subject is in order. Earlier in this chapter, I recommend that the trailer driver 
aim the trailer downstream on the ramp as much as practical to help mini-
mize the angle of the crosscurrent and to allow the boat handler to steer into 
the current to minimize its sideways effect. Here are some things you need to 
do as the boat handler to compensate as well:
 
✓ Handling drift: To compensate for the downstream drift, press your 
throttle lever forward. Ideally you should be making very slow head-
way, and steering is easier because your boat’s speed through the 
water is higher due to the speed of the current you’re driving into. 
You’ve probably already realized that boats steer more easily as they 
increase in speed.
 
✓ Swimming upstream: Start your approach downstream from the trailer, 
and aim the boat about half its width upstream of the trailer’s bunks. 
Proceed at just enough speed to maintain steering control.
 
✓ Throttling down: As you get close to the trailer, pulling back on the 
throttle a little and holding a steady course are often enough to allow 
the current to push the bow of the boat in line with the center of the 
trailer. If you need a little steering correction, be judicious about it and 
remember to wait for its effect so you don’t overcorrect. After your boat 
begins to turn downstream, it will turn at an accelerated rate.
Making contact with the trailer
All your maneuvering as the boat handler is aimed at making the contact 
between boat and trailer soft but firm enough to get the boat up on the bunks 
far enough that friction holds it in place. This section covers the fine points 
of the loading.

114
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Finessing the final approach
Approaching the trailer is the most stressful part of boating in my book. It’s 
not really as hard as it seems, but driving straight at a fixed object with pipes 
and posts and cranks sticking out of it seems like nautical suicide. But truth-
fully, the approach is painless if you do it slowly and follow these steps:
 
1. Keep your eye on the target, and aim the boat at the center of the 
trailer.
 
 As I drive the boat, I like to lean over toward the boat’s centerline so 
I can line up the peak of the bow with the bow roller and winch at the 
front and center of the trailer. That way, if the boat begins to drift off 
course even a little bit, I can spot it and correct for it while the correc-
tion required is slight. The closer to the trailer you get, the harder it is 
to make corrections that help.
 
2. Drive the boat onto the trailer, starting out slowly.
 
 A 28-foot cuddy weighing in at 7,000 pounds has much more force at 3 
mph than a 1,200-pound bass boat. You will find there’s a perfect speed 
for landing your boat, and it’s almost always less than walking speed. 
You can judge it only with experience, though, so start out each land-
ing slow. If you find that one speed barely gets you into the bunks, next 
time add a little more throttle. Or if no one is waiting to load behind you, 
back off the trailer and take another shot at it.
 
With a two-man loading crew, when the boat is centered on the trailer and far 
enough up to be reached with the winch, the trailer driver can give a clenched 
fist to signal the boat handler to stop. The boat handler should back off the 
throttle but leave the engine idling in gear, which prevents the boat from drift-
ing back off the trailer.
Getting your boat situated on the trailer
If you follow the steps in the previous section, most of the time your boat 
ends up most of the way onto the trailer. Use the winch to pull it the rest of 
the way in place. Instead of using the winch, some boaters power load their 
boats, using the brawn of the engine to push the boat the rest of the way 
onto the trailer against the bow roller near the winch. I use both tactics — 
the winch and power loading — depending on circumstances I explain in this 
section.
 
In some places power loading is illegal. It’s also a tricky maneuver that you 
shouldn’t try until you’re comfortable with every other tactic for loading your 
boat. But you’ll see it done and eventually want to try it yourself, so in this 
section I discuss both ways of getting the boat in place on the trailer.

115
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
Using power loading
One of the times when power loading is most useful is when you’re loading 
the boat by yourself and don’t have a helper.
 
With power loading, you face some risks. The worst is the risk of misjudging 
the power needed to load the boat on the trailer and instead launching the 
boat into the truck or the back of your tow vehicle. Yes, it has been done. More 
likely is that, as you throttle up your boat, the propeller fans the bottom with 
an enormous rush of water, contributing to a deep hole near the end of the 
ramp and a problematic mound of sand beyond the hole. It soon becomes 
impossible to pass the mound of sand without grounding your boat. On rocky 
waters, power loading has little effect on erosion under the water and it’s legal. 
On lakes with sandy or muddy bottoms that erode easily in current, power 
loading is almost always illegal. Watch for signs that indicate it is. Violate the 
signs, and you’ll discover a third risk — you could get a ticket and a fine.
When you understand the risks, loading with power isn’t hard if you have 
some experience loading your boat and are confident in how it handles on the 
ramp. Here are the steps — decide for yourself if you’re ready to use them:
 
1. Get the boat centered and nudged into place on the trailer (refer to 
the earlier section, “Approaching the trailer”).
 
2. Center the helm — that is, make sure the steering wheel is set for 
straight travel and not turns.
 
 Sometimes it pays to just walk back and look at the propeller over the 
transom (back of the boat) to make sure it’s straight.
 
3. Apply throttle to move your boat forward in the bunks until it meets 
the bow roller. This shouldn’t require more than about half-throttle — 
midway between wide-open throttle and idle speed — and it may 
require less.
 
 Add power progressively until you get the forward motion you want. If 
your boat moves forward, stops, and requires more than half-throttle to 
move again, opt for the winch to finish the job.
 
4. When the boat is all the way on the trailer, lean over the bow and 
snap the winch strap in place on the bow eye.
 
5. Shut down the engine and trim up the propeller with the trim switch 
on the throttle lever.
 
 If you don’t raise the propeller, it’s very likely to drag on the ramp or 
pavement as you pull away. This could damage the prop, the drive 
mechanism, and even the hull when pressure on the drive mechanism is 
transferred to the transom where it’s mounted. You don’t want this to 
happen.

116
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Using the bow winch with a partner
Using the winch to secure the boat is slower than power loading but safer — 
and there’s no risk of it being illegal in certain areas. When you’re loading the 
boat with a partner and you’re acting as the boat handler, here’s what the 
trailer driver does:
 
1. Pull out enough of the bow strap to meet the bow eye.
 
 The winch has a ratchet that lets you reverse the direction of cranking 
and a center position that lets you freely unwind the strap before reset-
ting the ratchet to crank the strap in.
 
2. Put the bow strap on the eyebolt on the bow of the boat, and reset the 
ratchet lever on the winch to allow the strap to be cranked in. Test the 
setting by turning the crank to make sure it’s right.
 
3. When the boat is secured to the winch, call out to the boat handler to 
shut down the engine and tilt up the propeller with the trim switch on 
the throttle lever to prevent damage.
 
4. Crank the winch and pull in the strap until it pulls the boat up tightly 
against the bow roller.
Using the bow winch alone
If you’re loading your boat alone and the ramp doesn’t allow power loading, 
here’s what you do:
 
1. Get the boat on the trailer far enough for the winch strap to reach it, 
put the engine in neutral, and see if the boat stays in position.
 
 If the boat wants to slide back on the trailer, put the engine in gear, 
nudge it up the trailer a little farther, and then test it again by shifting to 
neutral.
 
2. Shut off the engine, and trim up the prop so it doesn’t get damaged.
 
3. Climb over the bow and walk the trailer like a tightrope until you get 
to the bow winch (this is the part I hate). Grab the strap and connect it 
to the bow eye, and then winch the boat snug against the bow roller.
Getting Up a Slippery Ramp
In tidal waters, the area of the ramp between high and low tide is often very 
slippery with a slight slime on it. In rivers and impoundments, when water 
levels drop, areas of the ramp once underwater are covered in slippery algae. 
Even if this part of the ramp stays in the water, the algae are there for your 
sliding pleasure if you have to get your vehicle’s wheels in the water.

117
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
Following are some ways to get you, your vehicle, and your boat trailer off a 
slippery ramp:
 
✓ Rough up the ramp: A bag of plain clay kitty litter, coarse sand, or fine 
gravel makes handy work of putting traction on slippery spots. I’ve used 
all these materials at times, sprinkling them onto the slimy or slippery 
part of the ramp so my wheels get better traction. It works, and the next 
boaters usually appreciate it!
 
✓ Kick into four-wheel drive: You don’t usually need four-wheel drive to 
get up a slippery ramp, but when you do need it, you’ll say that one time 
you used it was worth the extra price on your vehicle. All-wheel drive 
or four-wheel drive puts some of the drive load on the front wheels of 
your vehicle, so if the back wheels are slipping in slime, the front wheels 
make up for it and pull you out. If you have four-wheel drive on your tow 
vehicle, set it to the lowest gear ratio when hauling out your boat so it 
gets the most traction.
 
✓ Engage an anti-slip transmission: My vehicle, a two-wheel drive Nissan 
Titan, has an anti-slip transmission that senses when one rear wheel is 
slipping and transfers the drive power to the other rear wheel. On a boat 
ramp, depressing the emergency brake halfway to just begin putting 
pressure on the brakes seems to activate the anti-slip mechanism, which 
always gives my vehicle a cleaner getaway. Release the brake as soon as 
you get good traction again.
 
✓ Get a boost from your trailered boat: This is a tricky maneuver, so I 
don’t recommend it. But I have done it and seen it done many times, so 
I know that it can work. With the vehicle driver in the vehicle and ready 
to go, the boat driver tilts up the prop high enough that it won’t hit the 
ramp and starts the boat engine. I usually wrap the kill-switch device (dis-
cussed in Chapter 7) around my left hand and grasp the throttle with my 
right hand. On a mutual signal, accelerate the boat as the driver acceler-
ates the car. Just as the prop clears the water — you can tell when that 
happens because the exhaust noise increases astronomically — yank out 
the kill switch to stop the engine. By that time, the vehicle has enough 
momentum to carry on.
Making Your Boat and 
Trailer Road-Ready
In a day of boating, you open the hatches a dozen times, move things around, 
and unfasten things that are ordinarily fastened. At 45 mph on the water, 
these loose ends usually aren’t much trouble. But on the highway at 65 to 70 
mph, things left loose or open are guaranteed to be lost or broken.

118
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Getting your boat ready to tow home is a project of details, and if you forget 
one, the ramifications are usually expensive, if not dangerous. Here’s what 
you need to do to secure your boat to the trailer, make sure the trailer is safe 
to tow, and make sure the boat is ready to stow when you get home:
 
1. After the boat is loaded, pull away from the ramp to the staging area.
 
 If there’s a line for the staging area, take your place. You need to stop 
here to get things squared away for the road home.
 
2. In the staging area, put away loose things, close and latch hatches, 
and make final boat position adjustments.
 
 It’s possible that pulling your boat up a steep ramp caused it to slide 
back a little. Put another turn on the bow winch to snug it up.
 
3. Hook the safety chain through the bow eye — the same eye on the 
bow that the winch strap connects to.
 
 Newer trailers come with these safety chains, and on more than one 
occasion I’ve been glad I kept this chain connected.
 
4. Connect the transom tie-down straps, and buckle them in place.
 
5. Remove the bilge plug so any future rainwater can run out. Stow the 
plug in a place you’ll remember, like the side door pocket of your 
vehicle or in a cup holder near the helm.
 
6. Double-check the trailer’s brake lights, red running lights, and turn 
signals.
 
 A bulb could’ve failed when it was subjected to the cooler water. Always 
keep some spare trailer light bulbs in your vehicle for this purpose.
 
7. If you were boating in salt water, rinse the trailer with fresh water as 
soon as possible. It’s as easy as the following three steps:
 
1. Use a garden nozzle on the hose to increase water pressure.
 
2. Spray the entire trailer with fresh water, and pay special attention 
to the lights and rollers on the trailer, dousing them liberally with 
fresh water.
 
3. Kneel down near the wheels and spray the back side of the wheels 
to get the brakes flushed of salt water in order to prevent corrosion.
 
8. If you were boating in salt water, flush your engine with fresh water.
 
• Outboards have a special nozzle on the back of the motor cowling 
onto which you can screw a hose. Attach the hose and turn on the 
water. Let it run while you run the motor for about five minutes, 
until the water running out is not longer salty. Keep the engine in 
neutral, and steer clear of the prop until the job is done.

119
 Chapter 6: Launching and Loading Your Trailered Boat 
 
• Sterndrives often don’t have a flushing fitting. (You need to ask 
your dealer to install a flushing fitting on your inboard engine.) Ask 
your marine accessories dealer for a set of ear muffs — he’ll know 
what you mean — that fit over the water pickups on the gear case 
of your motor. The water pickups are a series of holes or slots or 
sometimes mesh grill over an opening into the gear case. Water 
enters there and is pumped up to the engine. Attach a hose to the 
ear muffs and put them over the water intake openings. Run the 
hose while you run the engine for five minutes until the salt water 
is flushed out. Keep the engine in neutral, and steer clear of the 
prop until the job is done.
 
9. On your drive home, make regular safety stops.
 
 Make the first stop after 10 miles or so. By then, the boat may have 
shifted a little on the trailer, and you can tighten the bow and transom 
straps. After that, I’d stop every 100 miles or so to check the hubs for 
overheating (see Chapter 5 for more on that) and to let the vehicle and 
trailer cool off while you get refreshments and stretch your legs.
The steps in this section are all simple enough, and elaborating on them may 
seem unnecessary. But I’m reminded of my last trip boating. I confess that I 
forgot one of the steps and left a hatch open on the hard top over the cock-
pit. At highway speed, it flapped open and closed repeatedly until it broke 
off and flew away. It was certainly inconvenient and an expense to me, and it 
could have been dangerous to a vehicle behind me. The hatch is somewhere 
along the Beach Line Expressway, east of Orlando, Florida. I’ll never forget 
that step again.

▶ Shutting down properly
B
oats aren’t cars. If they were, what would be the fun in owning one? Still, 
too many people like to draw comparisons between boats and cars on 
their first boating excursions. Instead of trying to apply your driving knowledge 
to boating, erase what you know about driving a car and look at the boat for 
what you want it to be: something entirely new, adventuresome, and fun!
In this chapter, I show you how to safely fuel up your boat, get the motor 
purring like a kitten, and then put the pedal to the metal. Soon enough you’ll 
be holding your course and turning like a pro. You’ll discover how to adjust 
the boat’s trim and tabs for a great ride, plus some tricks you need to per-
form when you shut down so you can make a clean getaway when next you 
get underway. I also include some nuances in this chapter that, in just a few 
trips, will make you look like you’ve been boating all your life.
Fueling Up Your Boat
Before you can enjoy your boat on the water, you need to put fuel in it. 
Gassing up seems so easy that you’re probably growling something like, “Oh, 
for Pete’s sake. I fuel a car, a lawn mower, and a weed eater. How hard can 
it be to fuel a boat?” I actually hope you are muttering that, because some 
of what you already know applies to what you do when fueling your boat. 

122
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
But the truth is you also face some important and unique safety and critical 
mechanical considerations when fueling your boat. If you disregard them, a 
fire or engine failure could result.
In this section, I tell you how to fuel up on land at a gas station or at the dock 
at the marina. But first, you need to determine if your boat needs special oil 
in the fuel.
Taking care of your engine’s 
special oil needs
All engines need oil (as well as gas) to operate. Your boat may need special 
oil, and where you put it may surprise you! Oil maintenance depends on the 
type of engine your boat has.
Two-stroke engines
If you have an older outboard engine, chances are it’s a two-stroke engine. If 
you have a chainsaw or a gas-powered weed eater, you already know what 
I’m about to say. A two-stroke engine normally uses oil at the same time it 
uses fuel, and you either add oil directly to the gas or pour oil into a special 
reservoir on the motor. Here are some considerations to keep in mind when 
dealing with two-stroke outboard engines:
 
✓ Really old two-stroke outboards — say, those made before 1980 — usu-
ally need oil added to the gas. If you have one of these, it’s a classic, and 
if it has lived this long, you can count on even more years of enjoyment 
if you take care of it. Add oil to the gas at a ratio of 50 parts gas to 1 part 
oil. That amounts to 1 pint of oil for 6 gallons of gas.
 
 Engines vary in fuel/oil mix, so give your marine mechanic a call and ask 
exactly what oil mixture and oil type you should add.
 
✓ Most outboards made since 1980 have an oil reservoir on top of the 
motor cowling, under a large black twist-off cap. Most motors over 115 
horsepower have separate oil reservoirs, usually located under a hatch 
in the bilge or under the helm station (call that the dashboard, if you 
prefer). It’s best to keep these reservoirs filled and not let them get low, 
so check them every time you gas up and replenish the oil as needed.
 
The two-stroke oil standard is TCW-3. That’s the minimum standard of oil qual-
ity you should consider for your outboard. Make sure the oil you buy has the 
TCW-3 code on the label, and don’t settle for the cheapest TCW-3 oil you can 
get. I’ve seen some things behind the scenes at oil formulators, and I think 
paying more — though not necessarily paying the most — gets better oil for 
your engine.

123
 Chapter 7: Hitting the Open Water: Driving Your Boat
Other engine types
Your car is a four-stroke engine, and your dad probably told you all you need 
to know about that when you learned to drive: “Check the oil!” If your boat 
has a sterndrive, inboard, or one of the new four-stroke outboard engines, 
you have to add oil to the engine and check the level frequently. Find the 
yellow-handled dipstick on your engine and check the oil level every time you 
fill up and every time you start boating on any day. If it’s low, add the oil rec-
ommended by your owner’s manual. (I talk more about engine maintenance 
in Chapter 13.)
Fueling up on land
Fueling up on land at a regular gas station is often the easiest and least 
expensive method to begin your boating excursion with a full tank. Heck, you 
already stop there to fuel your car, so why not fuel your boat there, too?
 
Another plus to buying fuel on land is that gas station prices are almost 
always much cheaper than on-the-water prices.
Because most of your crew will either remain in the car or go inside to buy 
candy and soda while you fuel up, some of your safety considerations are 
already mitigated — you’re crew is out of the boat and out of the way! You 
always want your crew out of the way whenever and wherever you fuel up.
When you pull into the gas station, approach the pumps slowly and, if you 
need to, stop far short of the pumps to scope them out. You need a pump 
that meets the following criteria:
 
✓ It allows you to make a wide turn so you can pull the vehicle past the 
pump, turning wide to let the boat come up to it without hitting the end 
of the pump island.
 
✓ It’s on the same side as your boat’s fuel point when the boat is stopped 
next to it.
 
 Make sure you know on which side your boat’s fuel point is located 
before heading to the station!
 
✓ It lets you drive your rig forward out of the station without backing up 
when you’re done filling the tank. You can back up in a pinch, but back-
ing around pumps and other cars in a fuel station is pretty difficult — 
even for an expert.
Start out by checking your engine oil and adding oil if the level is low. When 
fueling up, follow the same safety precautions as when filling your car: Don’t 
smoke or use your cellphone, don’t overfill the tank, and wipe any spilled fuel 
from the boat so it doesn’t stain the finish.

124
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
When you leave the pump, turn wide around the end of the pumps and watch 
carefully that you don’t clip another car or a pump with your trailer.
 
Boating lore is full of stories of boaters who unwittingly filled their bilge with 
gasoline by sticking the nozzle in a rod holder or other non-fuel opening on 
the boat. The result can be explosive! Your boat’s fuel point will be marked 
“gas,” “fuel,” or “gasoline.” Take the time to read it before you stick the gas 
nozzle into it.
Fueling up at the dock
Fueling up at the dock isn’t as convenient as it may sound. The boat moves 
around on the water, making it difficult to keep up a steady fuel flow from the 
pump. Marina pumps also tend to be more primitive than gas station pumps 
and sometimes don’t work as well. And at the dock, you need to follow some 
special safety precautions.
All the same, if you’re out having a ball, you may need more go-juice to keep 
the dream alive, so chances are you’ll need to know the ropes of gassing up 
at a marina sooner or later.
 
Fuel vapor is heavier than air, and your boat behaves like a bowl, trapping all 
those fumes inside. Get your crew out of the boat before you add fuel, and 
keep them out until you follow the safety precautions I outline in the following 
steps. Anyone left in the boat during fueling could be exposed to a terrifying 
fire hazard.
Here’s your step-by-step guide to safely fueling your boat at the dock:
 
1. Be courteous.
 
 When you approach a fuel dock, it’s possible that you aren’t the first one 
there. If you see other boats drifting around nearby, they may well be 
in line before you. Find out “who’s on first” before you just barge in and 
gas up.
 
2. Secure the boat to the dock.
 
 Tie docklines between the bow and stern of the boat and the dock to 
ensure it’s secure.
 
3. Offload the crew.
 
 When your boat is secure at the fuel dock, ask all your passengers to 
step up onto the dock. The combination of settled fuel vapor and a spark 
or thoughtless smoker could cause a disaster, so get your passengers 
out of the boat.

125
 Chapter 7: Hitting the Open Water: Driving Your Boat
 
4. Find out where the safety equipment is.
 
 Marinas are required to keep equipment nearby to deal with fuel spills 
in the water. And many marinas prefer to fill your boat themselves to 
avoid just that. If you’re left to your own devices, make sure you know 
where the cleanup equipment is so you can handle any spills before they 
spread and foul the water.
 
5. Close all hatches.
 
 Fuel vapors are heavier than air and can drift and collect in low places, 
creating an explosive problem. Before fueling, close all hatches so fuel 
vapor can’t collect in compartments or in the cabin, if your boat has one.
 
6. Fuel up, and be patient while pumping.
 
 Boats are notorious for taking fuel slowly. So, if you’re fueling your boat 
yourself, run the pump at the slowest speed until you’re sure how fast 
the fuel tank can accept the fuel. You can increase the pump velocity a 
little at a time until you’re sure it won’t splash back from the nozzle.
 
 Keep a rag around the filler nozzle to capture fuel that may splash back 
out around the nozzle. Some fuel stations have an absorbent collar on 
the nozzle to do that for you.
 
7. Let the fumes dissipate before boarding.
 
 After you’ve fueled the boat, wait a few minutes before climbing aboard. 
Buy a soda or an ice cream bar and enjoy the marina action for a while 
before you settle back in, allowing time for lingering fuel fumes to start 
dissipating.
 
8. Run the engine blower before starting up.
 
 You should get in before anyone else and run the engine compartment 
blower for five minutes before starting the boat. Marked with a picture 
of a fan, the blower switch is near the helm, also called the steering 
wheel. Running the blower clears out any fuel vapor that has settled in 
the boat and bilge area where the engine is located. Outboards don’t 
have bilge blowers because the engine is outside the boat, but you 
should still let the fuel vapor drift away for several minutes before you 
board your refueled outboard.
 
9. Reboard the crew when you know it’s safe.
 
 Let your crew get in after a few more minutes. As the captain, the risky 
work is up to you! You know the lore: The captain goes down with the 
ship. (Frankly, I’d rather do things right and keep the ship from going 
down, wouldn’t you?)

126
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Getting Your Motor Running
Because you put a key into an ignition, starting your boat’s motor may seem 
the same as starting a car at first. But you need to keep in mind some signifi-
cant differences and safety precautions. You have no brakes and no clutch — 
and, well, it’s a boat! In this section, I fill you in on the differences so you can 
safely get your boat’s motor purring.
I start out with safety precautions and then tell you what you need to know 
about your motor before you can determine which tactic to use for starting 
it. And I get you prepared for what to expect from your first boat ride.
Putting safety first
Although starting a car involves a few safety steps (such as making sure noth-
ing is behind your car), there’s a little more to be aware of with a boat.
Checking around the boat and propeller
Before you start the motor, do a safety check around the boat. Make sure 
nothing, and certainly no one, is near the propeller or anywhere else nearby 
the outside of the boat. Get any overboard crew inboard right away, and 
don’t start the boat if people are swimming nearby.
Pulling up the anchor
It may seem silly to mention it, but make sure you’ve pulled up the anchor 
before you start the motor to move away. Too many boating injuries occur 
when an anchor is forgotten and a boat takes off. In some cases, the anchor 
can skip along behind the boat, stretching the anchor line like a rubber band 
until it snaps the anchor into the boat, injuring passengers.
Making sure the propeller is in the water
If you have an outboard or sterndrive engine, both of which can be tilted 
up out of the water, make sure the propeller is in the water. If you have an 
inboard engine with a fixed propeller and shaft that comes out beneath the 
boat, you can ignore this step.
 
With an outboard or sterndrive motor, running the motor more than a few sec-
onds with the propeller tilted up can damage the water pump and the engine.
The trim switch raises and lowers the propeller in outboards and sterndrive 
boats. It’s located on the throttle lever at the helm (you know the helm; it 
looks like a steering wheel). (See the section, “Adjusting the boat for a great 
ride,” later in this chapter for more on trim.)

127
 Chapter 7: Hitting the Open Water: Driving Your Boat
Using the kill switch lanyard
All boats made in the past 20 years or so have a kill switch intended to stop 
the motor if the captain falls out of his seat or overboard. The lanyard is usu-
ally a red plastic cord that looks like a phone cord. For safety, attach it to 
you, the captain, and to its special button on the boat (see Figure 7-1). Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Clip the lanyard’s metal or plastic hook to your belt or to one of the 
D-ring loops on your life jacket.
 
 Sometimes it’s more convenient to loop it around your wrist or knee and 
clip the line to itself.
 
2. Clip the other end of the lanyard to the plunger button on the boat.
 
 Putting this clip in place lifts the spring-loaded button so the boat can 
run. When it’s pulled off — for instance, if you momentarily forget your 
duties as captain and step away from the helm (I know, I know, you 
wouldn’t do that, but just if . . .) — the motor stops running.
Sterndrives and inboards have a different kill switch connector. The connec-
tor is usually located near the gearshift and throttle levers. The lanyard fits 
over a small lever and is secured by switching the lever to the Run position. If 
you pull the lanyard away, it resets the switch to an Off or Stop position.

switch

Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
Even though you can run the boat without attaching the lanyard to yourself, 
it’s not advisable. The engine can only run when the lanyard is attached to the 
button near the starting key or gearshift. When you’re attached to the lanyard, 
should you hit an unexpected wave and be knocked from the captain’s seat, 
the lanyard will pull out and automatically stop the boat. If the kill switch lan-
yard isn’t attached to you and you’re boating alone, you could be left stranded 
in the water, or worse, be hit by your own boat. Or the boat could travel until 
it strikes someone else, injuring that person. In some states, like Arkansas, 
making full use of the lanyard on both ends is mandatory.
 
I’m embarrassed to admit that more than once I thought the motor was broken 
because it wouldn’t start. Only after several failed attempts did I realize the kill 
switch lanyard wasn’t in place. I replaced it, and each time the motor started 
faithfully. So, if your motor isn’t starting, double-check the kill switch lanyard.
Priming the fuel line on outboards
If your boat has an outboard motor, usually before your engine will start you 
need to prime the fuel line. This is almost always true when the boat sits for a 
while (overnight or longer) and fuel drains from the lines back into the tank. 
To get the fuel back up into the line and into the engine where it can do you 
some good, use the rubber priming bulb, if your motor has one. Follow these 
steps to do so:
 
1. Look for the priming bulb near the engine.
 
 It should be on a black hose about 1/2 inch in diameter. I once had a 
bunch of kids boating with me, and one of them suggested it looked like

2. Squeeze the ball until you feel it firming up from filling with fuel.
 
3. It usually takes from three to six squeezes to fully prime the line.
You’ll usually have to prime the fuel line only the first time you start the 
motor on boating day. However, if your boat fails to start later in the day, re-
priming the fuel line is a good place to start troubleshooting.
Choking the engine and pumping the 
throttle on carbureted motors
Some boats start simply at the turn of a key. If yours is one of those, lucky 
you. You can turn the key, start the motor, and move on to the next section, 
“Getting Underway.” However, plenty of carbureted engines are still being 
used in boating today. If you’re not a bit of a motor head and don’t know a 
carbureted motor from the alternative, ask your dealer if yours is carbureted.

129
 Chapter 7: Hitting the Open Water: Driving Your Boat
Carbureted motors start only if you pump the throttle to start the gas flow-
ing. Pumping the throttle also chokes the engine, helping get the gas to the 
engine. If your boat motor is carbureted, follow these few extra steps before 
you turn the key:
 
1. Press and hold the fast idle button (also known as the fast idle switch) 
at the pivot point of your throttle.
 
 Pressing the fast idle button allows you to advance the throttle without 
putting the boat in gear, which makes starting the engine easier. It may 
not look like a button to you, but if you press on that pivot point, you’ll 
feel the round rubber trim give way, and you may hear a little click.
 
2. Holding the button in, push the throttle forward.
 
 This step advances the throttle without putting the propeller in motion 
(which is called putting the boat in gear).
 
3. Work the throttle back and forth three or four times.
 
 This equivalent of pumping the accelerator in an old jalopy causes fuel 
to squirt into the carburetor so it can do its job — make your engine go.
 
4. Turn the key.
 
 You may have to pump the throttle back and forth a few times while you 
turn the key. As soon as the engine gets purring, pull the throttle back to 
neutral. The fast idle button will reset itself.
 
 Usually three or four cycles of the throttle is all the pumping and chok-
ing your engine needs. If you overdo it, you can flood the engine and it 
won’t start. If that seems to be the case, let it rest for a few minutes, and 
then turn the key. If it still doesn’t start, consult the next section, 
“Troubleshooting a nonstarter.”
 
5. If you have any trouble starting your motor again later in the day, 
repeat these steps.
 
 When your engine is warmed up, it’s unlikely you’ll need to do anything 
but turn the key on the next startup that day.
Troubleshooting a nonstarter
You’re all set to enjoy a lovely day on the water. Everything is perfect. You 
take all the steps to start your boat’s motor — and then nothing happens. 
Don’t despair! In most cases the problem is easily remedied with basic 
troubleshooting.

address the most obvious and easiest possibilities first. Here’s how to trou-
bleshoot a starting problem like a pro:
 
1. Make sure your kill switch is in place.
 
 Remember, even an expert (c’est moi) can forget to hitch the kill switch. 
I cover the kill switch in the section, “Using the kill switch lanyard.”
 
2. Check the fuel level.
 
 It isn’t unusual for the gas gauge to fail, so if the motor won’t start — 
and unless you know the tank is full — add gasoline. You may have 
to return to the fuel station or marina, which may be a problem if the 
engine doesn’t work. You may have to wave down another boater for a 
tow in.
 
3. If the engine turns over but doesn’t start, it may be flooded with too 
much fuel in the carburetor. Give the excess fuel in the carburetor a 
few minutes to evaporate before trying to start it again.
 
4. If the engine doesn’t turn over (you know, that dead battery sound), 
you may need a jump-start from another battery, a charger, or a por-
table battery jumper (see Figure 7-2).
 
 Batteries discharge in as little as a week or two when the boat sits idle. 
One of the handiest gadgets you can have to combat a dead battery is an 
emergency battery jumper. This portable device has battery clamps that 
attach to the boat battery. The battery jumper recharges when plugged 
into a wall outlet. I keep one charging up in the garage and throw it in 
my truck when I head to the lake, just in case.

5. If you get no sound at all, make sure the battery switch is on.
 
 Many newer boats are equipped with battery switches that isolate the 
battery from electrical systems in the boat and prevent the battery 
from discharging during storage. You can usually spot the switch near 
or inside the engine compartment; it’s usually red in color and about 4 
inches square with a large knob. Turn it to either “on” or “battery one,” 
depending on how the switch is labeled.
If none of the preceding tips get you started, you may have to seek out a 
mechanic. But I recommend that you run through all the steps a couple of 
times to be sure you’ve covered all the possibilities. One of the best, most 
methodical boaters I know (my father-in-law) put his boat in storage full of fuel. 
When he returned with his boat to his dock, the boat wouldn’t start. He tried 
everything before he called a mechanic. When the mechanic checked things 
over, he found the fuel tank empty — someone had siphoned all the fuel.
Getting Underway
When you have that motor purring, you’re ready to “get underway” — that’s 
salty talk for “go.” The fun part is coming, but if this is your first ride in a 
boat, you may be a little alarmed the first time you pull away from the dock 
about something boaters call bow rise or loss of horizon (see the sidebar 
“The physics of planing”). You’ll also find it’s not as easy as it seems to get 
the boat going smoothly at a safe, steady speed. Don’t worry; in this section I 
walk you through all you need to know to get from point A to point B across 
the water.
Throttling up for take-off
When driving a car, you use the gearshift to change from forward to reverse, 
and you manipulate the gas pedal for more or less speed. When driving a 
boat, both functions are often carried out by the same lever, which behaves 
differently than you may expect:
 
✓ A boat’s throttle lever, unlike a car’s gas pedal, doesn’t return to idle 
if you let go. It tends to stay wherever you set it. So, if you’re going 50 
miles per hour and get bounced from your seat — no, it’s not very likely 
to happen, but it can — the boat will keep going 50 mph until someone 
or something stops it (unless you’re connected to the kill switch lan-
yard; refer to the section, “Using the kill switch lanyard”).
 
✓ Your boat’s throttle lever shifts the gears from neutral to forward or 
reverse.

132
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
The physics of planing
Most power boats are built to plane, or rise up, 
on the surface of the water. Exceptions include 
catamarans, pontoon boats, trawlers, and tugs. 
These kinds of boats have displacement hulls, 
meaning they remain settled down with much 
of their hulls below the waterline and they dis-
place water, moving it out of the boat’s way as 
it moves forward. These boats are slower and 
typically don’t have the bow rise you get in plan-
ing hulls.
A displacement hull (as seen on the top in the 
figure) has more of the hull settled into the water 
at cruising speed. A planing hull (as seen on the 
bottom in the figure) rides on top of the water 
and at cruising speed is said to be planing.
Planing hulls are made to skim on top of the 
water. The faster the boat goes, the less of it 
touches the water. Some boats go so fast that 
little more than a foot or two of the hull and the 
propeller touch the water at all. When they’re 
planing on top, they ride level, giving a clear 
forward view. But as they climb on plane, some 
boats point alarmingly high, obscuring your for-
ward view.
The bow rises as you accelerate. Bow rise 
happens when your propeller pushes forward 
on the boat, and the boat is trying to climb 
up on top of the water with the bow pointing 
high. As the boat climbs up, the bow rises and 
blocks your forward view, an effect called loss 
of horizon. Boat builders are getting better at 
minimizing this effect, but no boat goes with-
out it. Sometimes, boaters make bow rise even 
worse by trying to start out with their propellers 
trimmed up, meaning that the propellers are 
tilted upward too high.
TY 00134 MT
In displacement mode, a boat is going slowly and the hull is fully settled into the 
water and making a minimum wake.
TY 00134 MT
In planing mode, the boat’s speed causes it to rise up on top of the water. Most boats 
plane at about 20 mph.

133
 Chapter 7: Hitting the Open Water: Driving Your Boat
Here’s a step-by-step rundown of engaging your throttle to get underway and 
what to expect when you do:
 
1. Put safety first.
 
 Before shifting from neutral, first check around the boat and be sure it’s 
safe to engage the propeller.
 
2. Check the trim of the engine.
 
 Before you accelerate, make sure your propeller trim is in the full down 
position. You can tell by looking at the instrument marked “Trim” on 
your helm station. The trim gauge should be pointing to the down side 
of the dial.
 
3. Double-check the trim of the engine.
 
 It doesn’t hurt to just push the down side of the trim switch a few sec-
onds to be sure it’s in the right position. You’ll find the trim switch on 
the gearshift lever, and it’s usually positioned so that when you grab the 
throttle, the switch is under your thumb. The sound of the trim motor 
changes tone when the trim position is all the way down. (See the section, 
“Adjusting the boat for a great ride,” for more on trimming the engine.)
 
4. Engage the throttle.
 
 Squeeze the handle to release the safety stop, and push the throttle 
lever forward (or reverse to go backward).
 
5. Accelerate smoothly.
 
 Choosing a safe, steady speed is more easily done when you can see for-
ward and get a feel for traffic and water conditions. So, on acceleration, 
give the engine plenty of gas to get the boat up on top of the water and 
running level as quickly as possible.
 
6. Set cruise speed.
 
 When the boat levels out, pull the throttle back to a comfortable speed. 
Most boats plane at 20 mph, and a speed just over that mark is a good 
target. Any slower and you’ll plough along with your visibility blocked 
by a high bow — you know, the pointy front end — and stir enormous 
and unnecessary wakes (those waves behind you made by your boat 
cutting through the water).
Maintaining and changing course
When driving a car, maintaining course is easy because you just follow the 
road. And when you turn, although you may lean into the turn, your car gen-
erally stays level (unless you’re going way too fast!). On the water, there are 
no roads to follow, and a boat behaves differently than a car.

134
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
The boat leans over when you turn — a fact that may be alarming on your 
first trip out. Relax, though. This is natural, and it’s not a problem as long 
as your crew remains seated and you look around before you turn. Looking 
before you turn is normal in cars, but in boating, traffic comes from any 
direction, making awareness even more important.
 
The tendency for boaters is to feel like they’re all alone in their space on the 
water. Don’t fall into that dangerous trap. Look both ways before you change 
course; just as cars can on the highway, fast-moving watercraft can come out 
of nowhere.
Here are some of the most basic differences between a boat and a car:
 
✓ A boat responds more slowly than a car to input from the helm and 
throttle. This is especially true at slower speeds. When trying to guide a 
boat at slower speeds, it’s best to turn the helm a bit and then wait for it 
to react. This may take a few seconds. If it doesn’t turn as far as needed, 
turn the helm more.
 
✓ At slow speeds, the boat wanders. The bow points a bit right, then 
swings back to the left. The overall result is a straight course, but if 
you’re not aware of wandering, you may try to correct every little move-
ment, which only makes things worse.
 
 To get a feel for how much your boat wanders, test it. Choose someplace 
calm with open water, pick a landmark, and steer toward it. When the 
helm is centered, take your hand off the helm and watch what it does.
 
✓ At high speeds, boats tend to turn a bit (because of wind and current) 
when you’re aiming for a straight course. You may think you’re holding 
a straight course, but if you look back, you’ll see a slight curve in your 
wake.
 
 On short legs of your boating trip, curving isn’t a problem. But, if you’re 
heading 20 miles across a bay, you could find yourself lost at the other 
side. To avoid this problem, choose a landmark ahead and keep the bow 
pointed toward it. If you can’t see a landmark clearly, you need to keep 
your eye on the compass to hold your course.
Adjusting the boat for a great ride
Adjusting the ride of the boat involves managing the trim while taking 
into consideration the conditions on the water, as well as pitch, yaw, and 
roll. How you adjust for wind and waves says a lot about the boater you’ll 
become. Banging yourself, your boat, and your passengers over large wakes 
is bad for everyone involved.

135
 Chapter 7: Hitting the Open Water: Driving Your Boat
Understanding pitch, yaw, and roll
Boats can be a little like airplanes: Cars move only forward, back, left, and 
right, but planes and boats also move up and down, pitch, roll, and yaw. It’s 
your job as captain to manage and minimize the following effects:
 
✓ Pitch: Draw an imaginary line through the center of your boat from port 
(that’s the left side) to starboard (yep, the right side). The bow of your 
boat pitches up and down from that imaginary line. Naturally, the stern 
goes up and down, too, making the whole thing act sort of like a seesaw.
 
✓ Yaw: Drive an imaginary pin through the center of your boat from the top 
down (imagine an insect pinned in a collector’s box). Your boat can swing 
right to left around this pin, and that’s called yaw. It usually only happens 
when wind and waves push on the boat from one side or the other.
 
✓ Roll: Draw an imaginary line through your boat from the bow to the 
stern. Your boat rolls from side to side on this line when you turn or 
when waves wash under it from the side. The old expression “Don’t rock 
the boat” speaks primarily of rolling.
Trimming the propeller
Trimming your propeller doesn’t involve festive decorations. Rather, it 
involves raising and lowering the propeller. To adjust your boat for a great 
ride, trim the propeller for efficiency. It’s easy to do, but many boaters forget 
about it and never get the full enjoyment from their ride. Here’s how:
 
1. When you accelerate from a dead stop, the trim setting of your propel-
ler should be all the way down.
 
 All the way down often means the propeller is tucked a little in and is 
pointing slightly downward. A marine architect would call this negative 
trim, and it’s best used when starting from a dead stop.
 
2. As you begin to plane off, coming up on top of the surface of the water 
and leveling out, trim the propeller up slightly.
 
 The idea is to keep the propeller pointing in a line parallel to the surface 
of the water. When you get it right, the boat feels right — steady but free 
on the water.
 
3. Keep adjusting your propeller trim.
 
 Too little trim and the bow is stuffed downward, slowing the boat and 
making it harder to ride and handle. Too high and the propeller comes 
out of the water or sucks air from the surface into the prop, which is 
called ventilating. Ventilating causes loss of speed and loss of water 
supply to the engine, which leads to overheating.

136
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
4. As you cruise at various speeds, adjust the propeller trim to various 
settings.
 
 In time you’ll be able to detect the sweet spot in trim and instinctively 
adjust to it. You’ll soon find yourself trimming properly without even 
realizing you’re doing it!
Using trim tabs for a balanced ride
You can level the ride using trim tabs to manage roll (see Figure 7-3). Any boat 
can be equipped with these tabs, and they’re so useful that most boats should 
have them. Trim tabs come in pairs, one right and one left. They actually look 
like tabs and stick out from bottom of the transom (or back of the boat). You 
control them using a pair of switches near the helm. By using the switches to 
raise either tab up or down, you can cause the boat to ride more level.
 
Figure 7-3: 
Trim tabs 
level a 
boat’s ride 
by lifting the 
transom.
 
For example, suppose you have a couple of big people sitting on the port 
side, and the boat rolls that way. Lowering the tab on the port side lifts that 
side up (and vice versa, of course). In another example, suppose you’re 
running across a pretty strong wind. You’re trying to maintain a straight 
course, but the boat is leaning noticeably into the wind. Your boat is actually 
yawing because of the wind, and you’re unconsciously correcting by turn-
ing into it. Even though your boat is crossing the water on a straight course, 
it’s in a slight turn to counteract the wind’s attempt to force you off course. 
Remember, the boat rolls when it’s in a turn. Correct the leaning by putting 
the tab down slightly on the side of the boat that’s leaning down.

137
 Chapter 7: Hitting the Open Water: Driving Your Boat
 
Some trim tab controls are marked to tell you which way to push the button to 
raise or lower the tab. Others are marked to tell you how to push the button 
to raise or lower one side of the bow or the other. Read the labels on the tab 
controls so you don’t work them backward.
Shutting Down the Engine
Shutting down your boat’s engine seems simple enough, right? You just turn 
the key and turn off the engine, tie up the boat, and say ta-ta for now — kind 
of like when you pull your car into the garage and walk away; no muss, no 
fuss. Well, not so fast, matey! You should develop some helpful habits to save 
you from looking, well, unschooled in boating. Here’s a step-by-step guide to 
calling it a day (or just shutting down to take a dip):
 
1. Put trim tabs in the upright position.
 
 With the trim tabs up when you shut down the engine, if you change the 
load balance or anything else onboard, you’ll start up next time with no 
tabs on and be able to adjust properly from there.
 
2. Trim your outboard or sterndrive engine all the way down.
 
 If you don’t do this now, you’ll forget to do it when you take off again, 
and the bow will rise so high you won’t be able to see forward and your 
boat may not be able to get on plane until you lower it. Make a habit of 
trimming down whenever you turn the engine off, and you won’t forget.
 
3. Safely stow the key out of sight but not out of mind.
 
 You can keep the key in your pocket, but don’t go swimming or you risk 
losing it. One good place to hide the key is in the engine compartment. 
If you have to go there to retrieve it, you’ll remember automatically to 
check behind the boat to make sure the prop is clear before you start 
the engine.

Docking, Rafting Up, 
and Anchoring
In This Chapter
▶ Docking your boat without rocking the dock
▶ Rafting up with other boats safely
▶ Securing your boat properly with the right anchor
A
nchoring is easy, but there’s an art to doing it right, and it’s an art you 
can master. And docking? Most people find docking daunting — maybe 
even destructive at first. Of course, that won’t be the case with you after 
reading this chapter! Finally, rafting up with friends — meaning tying boats 
together — to hang out also requires some special tactics. Rafting up is 
bound to become your favorite way to have fun on the water.
 
Whatever you do, remember a boat is not a car. When you approach another 
boat or a dock, your automobile instincts may cause your foot to feel for a 
brake, and even though you already know there is none, before you know it 
you’ll be tappin’ your toe in search of it and not slowing down as a result.
You always need to approach docks and other boats thoughtfully and cau-
tiously. Doing so not only gives you time to react to the elements, but also 
gives you time to react to your useless-on-the-water, land-lubber instincts. 
Slow and steady is practically a guarantee of success.
In this chapter, you discover not only how to dock your boat but how to 
approach the dock and tie up your boat securely. I also discuss tactics to 
avoid performance anxiety when approaching your friends’ boats all rafted 
up in a quiet cove, how to hitch them together, and how to make sure, 
once you’re all snugged up, that you protect your boat from rub rash. For a 
secluded anchorage on your own in a deserted cove, I tell you how to set and 
anchor securely, too.

Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Docking Your Boat Like a Pro
Docking a boat is such a frightening task for some boaters that they actually 
hesitate to take their boats out at all. In fact, some marine motor companies 
have developed special engine systems that let boaters dock with the flick 
of a joystick. These systems cost thousands of dollars, yet boaters are still 
buying them. I think the new stuff is cool, but docking your boat just isn’t that 
hard. To make a soft, safe landing, all you really need is a slow and thought-
ful approach. In this section, I give you the inside track on getting inside the 
dock — without a ding.
Some more experienced hot-dogs love to charge the dock, slam the shift into 
reverse, and throttle back hard to stop just short of banging the dock. This 
technique may be exciting for bystanders, but it’s also dangerous for them 
and the people on the boat. What if the engine stalls with plenty of forward 
momentum still behind the boat? Don’t think it can’t happen.
 
Never approach docking at a speed above idle. In fact, it’s often better to shift 
in and out of gear to go even slower.
When docking, you basically have three choices about how to approach the 
dock (see Figure 8-1):
 
✓ Stern-in (backward)
 
✓ Bow-in (frontward)
 
✓ Alongside (sideways along the dock)
After you’ve docked, you need to tie off properly. I tell you how to do that at 
the end of this section.
Docking stern-in (back first)
Although backing your boat into a slip (the boating word for parking space) 
isn’t the favored way of docking, there can be very good reasons for doing 
so. I once crossed the Gulf Stream with friends who had never boated any-
where but freshwater lakes. When we reached port, I noticed a murmuring 
of surprise and maybe even disapproval when I pivoted the boat around and 
backed in. My passengers were probably thinking, “Why in the world would 
anyone go to that trouble when it’s easier to run the bow into the slip?”
The answer became apparent to them when we tied up. Bowlines had to be 
fastened to very tall pilings, and without the height of the bow to stand on, 
we would not have been able to reach the piling hooks. Plus, with the stern 
to the dock, stepping from the cockpit to the swim platform to the dock was 
as easy as walking into a convenience store. Had the pointy end been facing 

141
 Chapter 8: Docking, Rafting Up, and Anchoring
the dock, everyone would have had to climb to the bow, step over the anchor 
connected to the davit or bracket that held it, and then high-jump the bow 
rail onto the dock. Not very convenient. Docking stern-in was more trouble 
to accomplish, but for the more than 16 hours per day the boat was in port, 
boarding and using the boat was more convenient.
When to dock stern-in
Backing in can be the hardest way to dock, but it’s definitely more convenient 
for cruisers and cuddies with closed bows. Today, even small runabouts have 
walk-through transoms (the backs of boats) that provide open, secure footing 
all the way to the cockpit. So plenty of people think backing in is a good idea, 
and sometimes it is. (To review cruisers, cuddies, runabouts, and other types 
of boats, turn to Chapter 2.)

Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Docking stern-in is the best, most convenient, and safest option in the follow-
ing circumstances:
 
✓ When the wind is whipping across the opening of the slip
 
✓ When a current is running across the slip opening
 
✓ When your boat has a closed deck with a cuddy cabin up front instead 
of bow seating, making it easier to board from the stern
 
✓ When prevailing wind and waves are blowing straight into the dock, 
making it safer for the boat to take the seas on the bow than on the stern
How to dock stern-in
In a lot of ways, docking stern-in is easier than you think. Sure, you have the 
discomfort of looking over your shoulder as you throttle up and down and 
shift and steer. But especially when it’s windy, a boat is easier to pull than it 
is to push — the propeller can do whichever you tell it to do.
Follow these easy steps to dock stern-in:
 
1. Determine which way the current and wind are moving around the 
dock.
 
 You want to start your docking maneuver downwind of the slip. It’s 
much easier to control the boat when backing against the wind or cur-
rent than when backing with it.
 
2. Drive toward the slip, and when your boat is about one boat length 
from the slip opening, turn downwind 90 degrees.
 
3. Put the boat in reverse and back it straight back, keeping your 
90-degree orientation to the slip opening until your stern is even with 
the far side of the slip.
 
4. Turn the helm (steering wheel) toward the dock.
 
 You can move the gearshift back and forth between neutral and reverse 
to keep the boat moving slowly enough. You’ll quickly see the boat turn-
ing toward the slip, but it may be pointed right at the walkway on the far 
side. That’s not a problem — just move on to Step 5.
 
5. Shift into neutral, spin your wheel all the way in the opposite direc-
tion, and pop the gearshift into forward for just a moment.
 
 When you do this, your boat will stop its backing motion and start pivot-
ing to better orient the stern to pull into the slip. You may have to repeat 
Steps 4 and 5 more than once to get the ideal alignment of boat to slip.
 
6. Back in slowly, adjusting the helm position to steer the boat along the 
center of the slip.
 
7. When you’re in as far as you want to be, nudge the gearshift into for-
ward to stop your motion.

143
 Chapter 8: Docking, Rafting Up, and Anchoring
 
8. Secure your boat to the dock (see the section, “Tying your boat safely 
to the dock,” later in this chapter for instructions), and bask in the 
knowledge that you’ve proven yourself a whiz at one of the hardest 
parts of boating!
Docking bow-in (pointy end first)
Docking bow-in is so common that most people think backing in is showing 
off. With the average small runabout (boats fewer than 25 feet in length), dock-
ing bow-in is often — but not always — the simplest way to moor your boat. 
(Did you catch that new term? Docking and mooring mean the same thing.)
When to dock bow-in
You should dock your boat bow-in when one or more of the following circum-
stances exist:
 
✓ Your dock is on a still lake or protected cove that’s unlikely to kick up 
seas (waves) or experience wakes from passing boats that can wash 
over the transom and flood the boat.
 
✓ Walkways down either side (port/left or starboard/right) of the boat 
offer two ways of boarding and minimize the need to board via the tran-
som platform at the back of the boat.
 
✓ The wind blows across the head of the dock, sending the seas or waves 
toward your approach. Docking bow-in in this situation is safer for your 
boat because it takes the turbulence on the bow.
 
✓ You need the deeper water farthest from the dock and shore to keep 
your propeller from hitting bottom.
How to dock bow-in
Driving straight into a slip is the easiest thing to do. To do it well, though, 
you need to go slowly and carefully estimate the impact of crosswinds and 
currents on your boat’s path.
Follow these steps to make driving into a slip a snap:
 
1. Line up the boat with the slip one to two boat lengths from the slip 
opening.
 
2. Put the gearshift in reverse to stop your boat’s forward motion, and 
then shift back to neutral.
 
3. Watch carefully to see if the wind or current has any sideways impact 
on your course to the dock slip. You’ll be able to see any drift side-
ways when you’ve taken off all power.

144
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
4. With the helm aimed straight ahead, shift into forward.
 
 However, if wind or crosscurrents push you off course, aim upwind or 
up current and monitor both forward progress and your drift. In a way, 
it becomes a game of guessing how much drift you need to account for.
 
5. If the boat’s forward momentum builds too quickly, shift back and 
forth from neutral to forward or even from forward to reverse to mod-
erate speed.
 
 Go slowly. If you hit the dock at a slow speed, the impact will be mostly 
embarrassing, but not damaging or life threatening. (Go ahead and for-
give yourself right now because sometimes you will hit the dock. It’s a 
fact of boating life.)
 
6. Secure your boat to the dock (see the section, “Tying your boat safely 
to the dock,” later in this chapter for instructions).
Docking alongside (parallel)
Docking alongside is equivalent to parallel parking on the street, but some 
people feel it’s a little easier in a boat than in a car. You have few reasons 
to dock alongside the dock, and I recommend that you avoid it because it 
increases the chance that your boat will acquire scrapes and scuffs on the 
dock side of the boat. But it’s not hard to do, and with proper placement of 
padded fenders to absorb dock knocks, mooring the boat safely parallel with 
the dock is possible.
When to dock alongside
When should you dock alongside (also known as docking beam-to)? When it’s 
your only choice (which is pretty much the only reason most people parallel 
park their cars). Sometimes the only option you have is to sidle up to a long 
pier in between other boats. That’s almost always the case at a gas dock or 
courtesy dock found at the boat ramp.
How to dock alongside and between other boats
Sometimes, such as at the short pier of a boat ramp’s courtesy dock, docking 
alongside is as simple as driving straight in, stopping the motion of the boat 
with reverse shifting, and tying up. But sometimes you’re faced with parking 
parallel between a couple of other boats. Here’s how you can do that easily:
 
1. Aim your boat at the point on the pier where you want to moor, 
approaching it at an angle of about 45 degrees.
 
 Keep the throttle nice and slow, popping it in and out of gear to go 
slower if you need to.

145
 Chapter 8: Docking, Rafting Up, and Anchoring
 
2. When you get within a quarter of your boat’s length from the dock, 
turn the helm (steering wheel) all the way toward the pier and put the 
engine in reverse.
 
 This movement stops the boat’s forward motion and swings the stern to 
the dock at the same time. The bow continues moving toward the pier 
as the propeller pulls the whole boat sideways. You can coast the last 
bit of the way.
 
3. Just before the stern touches the dock, give the gearshift a short, easy 
touch of the forward gear to stop the boat and let you tuck fenders 
between the pier and the boat.
 
4. Secure your boat to the dock (see the next section for instructions).
 
Never dock alongside a pier when a current is sweeping you toward the pier. 
Your boat may be pushed under the dock, injuring you, your crew, and the 
boat. Always dock on the down-current side of a pier.
Tying your boat safely to the dock
You may never hit anything with your boat — not the trailer, not the bottom 
of the lake, not a dock piling — but if you don’t tie your boat properly, you’ll 
come back to find it scratched and gouged from working against the dock no 
matter how padded the dock appears.
I’ve spent years trying to help people moor their boats in a way that prevents 
docking damage from happening, but new boaters tend to have a hard time 
grasping the idea that the boat keeps moving even when it’s turned off and 
tied up.
 
The trick is to give the mooring lines enough slack that the boat can move 
with the waves but not move enough to be banged into the dock. It takes a 
combination of fenders and strong docklines. (On a boat, lines are just ropes 
until they’re attached to the boat, and then they’re called lines.) In this sec-
tion, I walk you through the steps of tying up a boat perfectly based on how 
you’re docked.
Securing your boat with a four-point connection
When you dock bow-in or stern-in, you can extend four lines — one from 
each quarter of your boat (port stern, starboard stern, port bow, and star-
board bow) — and easily center the boat in the slip and control the motion 
of the boat. Each of your docklines should already have a loop in one end, 
and that’s what you hook around each cleat on your boat. Put the line loop 
through the hole in the cleat, and then wrap it around the ends of the cleat 
for a secure connection.

146
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Here’s how to lash your lines to the dock:
 
1. For the dockline on the bow, choose a cleat forward of the bow. For 
the stern dockline, choose a cleat aft of the bow. This arrangement 
keeps the boat in position at the dock.
 
2. Attach lines to your boat cleats by feeding the looped end of your 
dockline through the center eye on the boat cleat. Pull the loop 
through and spread it open and bend it back to the cleat putting it 
around each end of the cleat. Put one line on each cleat you’ll want to 
tie to the dock.
 
3. Lash your lines around the cleats: Bring the line past the cleat and 
under the prong farthest from the boat cleat. Then bend it around the 
cleat under the back prong (see Figure 8-2).
 
4. Make figure-eights: Cross the line over the center of the cleat and 
around the front of the cleat under the front prong. Cross the line 
over the cleat again and then around and under the back prong (see 
Figure 8-3).
 
5. On the last loop, close your fist on the line with your palm up, making 
a U of the line.
 
6. Make a loop in the line by twisting your hand over so the loose end 
(boaters call that end the bitter end) of the line is underneath, and 
insert the last wrap under the line (see Figure 8-4).
 
7. Put the loop over the cleat’s end and pull on the bitter end to cinch it 
tight (see Figure 8-5). That lashing will last until you take it out.
 
Fasten docklines on all four quarters of your boat, and let out just enough line 
to suspend the boat in the middle of its slip. That’s the key to avoiding 
damage and keeping your boat from rubbing against the dock.

Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Tying up when you dock alongside
When docking alongside the pier, you won’t be able to tie your boat on both 
sides. In this case, you’ll need to rely on fenders positioned between the boat 
and the pier for protection. Here’s how to tie up alongside:
 
1. Loop two docklines, one onto the boat’s bow cleat (front) and one 
onto its stern cleat (back), and let them both lie in the boat until you 
need to tie them to the dock.
 
2. Hang fenders at two or three points between the dock and boat to pre-
vent scratches and scuffs from wave and wind action.
 
 Your boat most likely has a midships cleat (a cleat in the middle), and 
that’s a great place to hang a fender. Lash the fender line onto the cleat, 
leaving enough rope out that the fender hangs between the dock and the 
boat. Do the same with the stern cleat. If your boat is long enough and 
you have more connection points, put out as many fenders as you have 
for maximum protection.
 
3. Adjust the length of the fenders’ lines so they can’t ride up on the 
dock or tuck in below, where they won’t protect your boat.
 
 You can adjust the fender height by adding or subtracting a loop or two 
around the cleat.
 
4. Tie your docklines from the stern and the bow to cleats on the dock.
 
 You’ll probably find several cleats on the dock; choose the ones that are 
about a quarter of your boat’s length beyond your bow and stern cleats. 
That distance allows the boat to move up and down with the waves but 
still keeps it in place.
 
Many boaters forget to pull their fenders in when they go boating. I expect 
better from you! Leaving fenders out marks you as a beginner. It’s also danger-
ous because as you speed along the water, the fenders can bounce back into 
the boat, striking passengers and causing injury.
Undocking and shoving off
Docking your boat and tying it up are all very well and good, but I imagine the 
time will come when you’ll want to undo the process and get back out onto 
the water.
The following steps help get you untied and safely underway, but there’s no 
hard and fast procedure because as in docking, conditions (where you are, 
what the water and wind are doing, and so on) always change. The key, as in 
all boating activities, is to be safe and take your time.

149
 Chapter 8: Docking, Rafting Up, and Anchoring
 
1. Do a safety check, looking all around your boat and checking for prop 
clearance.
 
2. Run the bilge fan for two or three minutes to remove gasoline vapors 
before starting your engine.
 
3. Take note of wind and current conditions, considering which way 
they may push you.
 
4. With the engine warmed and ready for a trot, have your crew untie 
the downwind or down-current lines first, whether they be port or 
starboard or from the bow or the stern in a crosswind or crosscurrent.
 
 A true captain calls these lines the leeward, nautically pronounced lou-
word, and uses astern for “from the stern.”
 
5. Have your crew unlash the upwind or up-current lines from the cleats 
but hold onto them until you’re ready to begin moving safely away 
from the slip.
 
 Boating lingo for “upwind” is windward.
 
6. Make sure the way is clear outside your moorings, and nudge the boat 
in gear to pull out.
 
7. Have your crew pull in the lines and fenders and stow them safely.
 
If you’re boating alone, the process of undocking and shoving off doesn’t 
change much, but you can expect to be a lot busier than if you had a crew. 
Follow the same steps, and after moving a safe distance from the dock, put the 
engine in idle and stow your lines and fenders securely before moving on.
Rafting Up with Fellow Boaters
Rafting up with other boats (meaning tying your boat to others) is a biggie 
in the book of boating fun, and it’s a great way to meet new boating friends. 
Look around on any lake and you can find a number of favorite spots for it. 
You probably also see some boats already hitched together.
Raft up carefully by following the guidelines in this section, and you’ll make 
friends and impress people with your expertise!
Approaching a boat or raft at anchor
If you approach another boat the wrong way and cause damage, or if you try 
to join up with a rafted group that doesn’t want guests, you’ll make enemies 
instead of friends. Do two things before you approach a boat or group that’s 
anchored:

150
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
1. Find out if they want company.
 
 You can hail them with a friendly shout or raise them on the VHF radio, 
if you both have one. But no matter how you communicate, establish 
mutual intent before you approach.
 
2. Find out on which side of the boat they want you to approach.
 
The captain or crew on the other boat may try to coach you in, but their direc-
tions may be confusing and counterproductive. It’s best to have a strong strat-
egy for doing it yourself that includes cooperating with the boat or boats 
you’re approaching.
Hitching your boats together
There’s no trick to hitching boats together, and it’s much like hitching to a 
dock. One difference, though, is that you use shorter, tighter lines with fend-
ers between the boats for protection. Hopping back and forth between boats 
simply isn’t safe unless the moorings are firm and secure.
Follow these six easy steps to raft up like a pro:
 
1. After you and the other boaters have agreed which side you’ll be 
tying up to, position your boat so your bow is facing the same direc-
tion as theirs.
 
 This positioning makes mooring easier and also makes pulling away 
later easier, too, because you can back out without having to maneuver 
around the anchor lines from the other boat’s bow.
 
2. Approach slowly, shifting in and out of gear to moderate speed.
 
3. When your boat’s stern is even with their stern, tap the shifter into 
reverse to stop motion.
 
4. Tie a couple of fenders to the side of the boat that is against theirs.
 
 Your fenders should hang so they nest between both boats, preventing 
the boats from touching (see the next section for more on using fenders).
 
5. Fasten mooring lines to the cleats on the side of your boat that’s 
against the other boat.
 
6. Hand over your mooring lines, and let the other boaters fasten them 
to their cleats.
 
 If the other boat is already securely anchored, you don’t need to put down 
your anchor, too. In the event that you do need to drop your anchor, see 
the later section, “Determining where and how to set the anchor.”

151
 Chapter 8: Docking, Rafting Up, and Anchoring
Putting fenders at the rubbing points
Fender placement is so critical to protecting boats from damage. I discuss 
using fenders between your boat and the dock earlier in this chapter, but 
here are a few more suggestions for fastening and keeping fenders in the per-
fect position while you’re rafted up with another boat:
 
✓ Fenders need to hang along the most vertical area of your freeboard 
and the other boat’s freeboard. Freeboard is just a fancy term for the 
side of your boat; a boat with a lot of freeboard has high sides. By posi-
tioning fenders between the most vertical surfaces, you can minimize 
the fenders’ movement and increase their effectiveness.
 
✓ Put fenders out on your boat even if the boat you’re mooring with has 
them out as well. It’s a double insurance policy that each boat has the 
protection where it’s needed.
 
✓ Keep checking the fenders periodically to be sure the knots are tight 
and the fenders remain in the best position to protect. I find so many 
fenders floating on the water when I boat that I may never need to buy 
another one!
 
When your fenders aren’t in use, stow them in a clean area free of grit and 
sand. Sand and grit can become stuck in the fenders, turning them into sand-
ing blocks instead of protectors.
Breaking up the party and the raft
Eventually it comes time to say good-bye and leave the raft. If you’re on the 
outside of a raft, leaving is easy. Just cast off the lines and shove off or idle 
away to a safe distance before you hit the throttle.
If your boat is positioned between two other boats that don’t want to leave, 
pulling away is slightly more complicated by the fact that when you back out 
the others will want to be able to pull their boats together and close up your 
space. Pass lines from one boat over yours to the other one. As you pull out, 
you and your crew have to guide the lines over your windshield and other 
potential snags on your boat. Idle away to a safe distance before you hit the 
throttle.
Be sure to say thanks to those who have helped and wave good-bye as you 
cruise into the sunset.

152
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Anchoring Your Boat the Right 
Way with the Right Anchor
This may sound odd to you, but ask most boaters what they do with their 
speedboats and they’ll tell you they drop a hook and hang out. Hook is just 
boater-slang for anchor, and the best part of boating, in many boaters’ eyes, 
isn’t going fast but stopping. An anchored boat out on the water can be like a 
private island in a secluded cove.
 
It’s a myth that an anchor holds a boat in place by the force of its weight. In 
truth, an anchor holds a boat in place by hooking onto the bottom. That’s why 
boaters call it a “hook.”
Many kinds and shapes of anchors exist, and they differ in the bottom condi-
tions they’re made for. It doesn’t matter much what they weigh as long as 
they sink at a practical velocity.
All anchors have several things in common, which I discuss in this section. I 
also recommend three anchors I think work best in most situations and one 
you shouldn’t waste your money on.
 
For safety purposes, it’s always good to have at least one spare anchor 
onboard. And sometimes you just need to drop more than one anchor, so a 
spare is a must.
Understanding the parts of an anchor
There’s more to an anchor than just the hook part. Here’s an overview of 
anchor parts and terms:
 
✓ The actual anchor is the metal device that hooks the bottom.
 
✓ A chain is attached to the anchor to help the anchor lie down on the 
bottom so it can dig into the mud or sand or snag a rock. The chain also 
provides a more secure connection for the part of your anchor tackle 
that’s most vulnerable to being cut by chafing.
 
✓ Rode is rope that connects the chain and your boat. Nope, I didn’t mis-
spell rode. That’s the nautical term for rope when it’s attached to an 
anchor. I remember it by this gimmick: “My boat rode all night on the 
anchor.”
 
✓ Scope is the amount of rode you let out on your anchor. Depending on 
conditions, your scope usually is three to five times the water’s depth, 
and sometimes even longer scope is preferable.

153
 Chapter 8: Docking, Rafting Up, and Anchoring
 
✓ Swing is the amount of movement your boat experiences at anchor as 
the tide or wind changes direction. When you’re planning to sleep out 
all night on the hook, you need to make sure your boat can swing 360 
degrees around the anchor without hitting the shore or anything else.
Choosing the right anchor style
Different-shaped anchors exist for different duties. Some anchors hold well 
on mucky bottoms, and some hold better on rocky bottoms. Some waters 
vary from mucky, rocky, sandy, and weedy bottoms, so if you regularly 
need to anchor in all conditions, you definitely need to have more than one 
anchor. You should ask around about the waters you’re boating in to get a 
hint of bottom structure and what anchors work best in your area. Here’s a 
rundown of the most effective anchors and where they work best:
 
✓ A plough anchor (see Figure 8-6a) looks like an old horse-drawn plough. 
It has a blade shaped to dig under grass and then go deeper and deeper 
under it. A plough anchor also works well in sand, mud, and gravel, but 
it works poorly on rock.
 
Figure 8-6: 
A plough 
anchor (a), a 
fluke anchor 
(b), and a 
grapnel 
anchor (c).

154
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
 
✓ A fluke anchor (see Figure 8-6b) has two triangular sections called flukes 
and a long shaft to which you fasten a chain and rode. The flukes dig 
or plough into the bottom as tension is put on the anchor. This type of 
anchor works well in sand, fine gravel, and mud. It doesn’t work well on 
grassy flats or hard rock because it tends to skim over the grass instead 
of digging in, and it doesn’t always grip rock well.
 
✓ A grapnel anchor (see Figure 8-6c) looks like a device from an action-spy 
flick: It has a shaft and four or five hooked tines that can snag the edge of 
rocks or hard obstructions. It sometimes works well on grassy flats, too.
Determining where and 
how to set the anchor
Unlike parking your car in the garage, an anchored boat isn’t stationary. This is 
important to keep in mind when choosing the place to put down your anchor.
Think of your anchored boat like a dog on the end of a staked rope. He can 
travel 360 degrees around the anchor point of that rope, and if you get inside 
his circle, you’re his, for better or worse depending on the dog. A boat on an 
anchor can roam the same way. But if the circle within which your boat can 
move has any other stationary thing in it — say, the shore or a dock or a rock 
outcropping — then eventually your boat will hit it.
The wind or the current may shift, and your boat may drift in another direc-
tion. Sometimes, when your boat swings only 180 degrees on the anchor, the 
hook loses its grip and your boat drifts ashore. So choose your anchoring 
spot carefully.
Here are some handy steps to follow to anchor properly:
 
1. Prepare to anchor from the bow.
 
 If you anchor from the stern (the back), the anchor can pull the back 
end of the boat down far enough to let water in, especially in a current.
 
2. Drop the anchor, paying attention to its depth.
 
• If there’s a current, drive up into it and lower the anchor, gaug-
ing its depth as the line passes through your fingers. Current 
usually moves a boat more than wind, so anchoring by driving into 
the current takes priority over anchoring by driving into the wind. 
If you’re alone, pull into the current ahead of the spot where you 
want to place the anchor, and then lower it as you drift away.
 
 Some boaters use a permanent marker to mark 10-foot incre-
ments of depth on the rode to help them determine how much 
scope to let out.

155
 Chapter 8: Docking, Rafting Up, and Anchoring
 
• If there’s a wind but little or no current, drive into the wind 
to lower the anchor. Even a calm breeze will swing your boat 
around, so always drop the anchor upwind from the boat if 
there’s no current.
 
 If you’re not boating alone, have a crew member lower the hook and 
report the depth to you, gauging its depth as the line passes through his 
or her fingers. He or she can pay out rode while you back away from the 
anchor (the next step), and then call out the length of the rode.
 
 Minimum rode-to-depth ratio is 5 to 1. So, if your water depth is 10 feet, 
you should pay out at least 50 feet of rode, counting the chain. That 
seems like an enormous amount of rope for a shallow spot; maybe on a 
calm day you could get by with 30 feet, but if you want your anchor to 
hook up and stay that way, at least 50 feet is what it takes.
 
3. When the anchor and rode are out to the appropriate length, back up 
the boat a bit away from the anchor.
 
 Keep the engine’s force on the rode until you feel the anchor dig in and 
you quit drifting. Then you can turn the engine ignition to “Off.”
 
It’s always best to lower the anchor rather than to drop or throw it. The latter 
may cause the anchor and rode to tangle, making the anchor ineffective.
If you’ve dropped your hook correctly, you can relax and pop open a cold 
drink. And if you don’t plan to move the boat until tomorrow, a beer or a 
cocktail may even be appropriate.
Keeping an eye out for 
drift while anchored
Even at anchor, you can’t quite relax completely. You need to keep an eye 
open for anchor movement. Once you get your anchor set, take a couple of 
land bearings — maybe one on each side of the cove or lake or river, with 
you in between. If you notice any movement at all, keep an eye on things until 
the movement requires you to reset your anchor or it stops.
Many Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have software in them that lets them 
monitor your anchor position and sounds an alarm if it moves more than 
the distance you specify from its original spot, alerting you to the slippage. 
That’s a great device to have onboard, and if you plan to stay out all night, 
you should be sure to get a GPS with that feature. (See Chapter 10 for more 
on GPS and other onboard gadgets.)

156
Part II: Safely Operating Your Boat 
Weighing (raising) anchor
When it’s time to head back to the dock or just explore the waters more, it’s 
time to weigh anchor — or pull it up. Follow these steps:
 
1. After checking for propeller clearance and running the bilge blower 
to remove gas fumes, start your engine.
 
 You don’t want to set yourself adrift by hoisting the anchor and then 
discovering the engine won’t start.
 
2. After the engine is warmed up and ready to go, have one of your crew 
pull in the anchor rode while you drive slowly up toward the anchor.
 
3. If the anchor is stuck to the bottom, have your crewperson turn a 
couple of figure-eight lashes around the cleat and hold the rode while 
you gently nudge the throttle forward to create more thrust to help 
pull the anchor loose.
 
 If the anchor is really stuck, you may have to repeat this step, approach-
ing the anchor point from several angles.
 
4. When the anchor is free of the bottom, your crew member can pull it 
up, swishing it around in the water to remove mud and weeds before 
stowing it in the locker.
 
 The best way to stow the anchor in the locker is to just feed the rode 
into the locker as you pull in the anchor — don’t worry about coiling 
the rode — and then lay the anchor on top of the rode. If your boat has 
special hangers for the anchor in the locker, use them.
 
If you boat alone, weighing anchor while piloting the boat is all your job. If 
there’s no current, you can ease the boat up to the anchor, put the engine in 
neutral, and walk forward in the boat to hoist the anchor. If there’s a current, 
pull upstream of the anchor, taking care not to foul the rode in the propeller, 
and pull the rode tight with the motor. This should nudge it loose. Then, with 
the engine in neutral, walk forward and hoist the anchor.

Part III
With Much Boating 
Fun Comes Much 
Responsibility

In this part . . .
T
he best part of boating is heading away from the 
ramp or dock for a long day of adventure. But without 
the right gear and some important knowledge of boating 
safety, an adventure could turn into more than you 
bargained for. In this part, I explain the different needs 
boaters have for navigation electronics, charts, and 
communications equipment, and then I help you find the 
right stuff for your boat. I also explain how to handle 
yourself and your boat in unexpected bad weather or 
other emergencies.

Chapter 9
Rules Do Apply: Navigating to 
Avoid Collisions and Confusion
In This Chapter
▶ Being aware of both U.S. Coast Guard and state boating rules
▶ Deciphering boat lights
▶ Letting navigation markers point you in the right direction
T 
      he United States Coast Guard publishes an enormous book of naviga-
tion rules that serve one main purpose: help boats avoid colliding with 
each other. But unless you plan to be a professional boater, neither the 
Coasties nor the local water cops will require you to know every page of 
these rules.
If you understand and follow the rules in this chapter, you’ll have a head start 
on passing the rules section of any boater safety course you take — and more 
importantly, you’ll stay safer in your boat. The rules help boaters know what 
to do when meeting, crossing paths, and overtaking other boaters, and they 
tell boaters how and when to moderate speed. The rules also explain traffic 
management schemes that guide you and other boaters along safe channels.
Sharing the Water: Boating Rules
States’ boating rules are based on the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules. The 
overlap makes sense because the Coast Guard has been regulating navigation 
in American waters since before some states were admitted into the Union. To 
help you better understand how boating rules work, here’s more information 
on how state and U.S. Coast Guard rules overlap and interplay with each other:
 
✓ States and the U.S. Coast Guard cooperate to enforce rules in many state 
waters. However, the Coasties don’t enforce navigation rules in land-
locked waters that aren’t open to commercial waterways, such as stand-

160
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
alone lakes. The Coasties’ primary concern is to protect boaters and 
commercial interests in waters used for shipping and commerce.
 
✓ With respect to safety equipment and boat registration rules, individual 
states often enforce a stricter code than the U.S. Coast Guard does, so 
you want to make sure you’re aware of state rules.
 
✓ When it comes to watersports such as water-skiing, the Coasties don’t 
make any rules, so individual states are responsible for establishing and 
enforcing watersports safety rules.
 
✓ In an accident, the Coast Guard rules form the basis for determining 
fault and liability of the parties involved.
Bottom line: Some states may have more restrictive boating rules than the 
U.S. Coast Guard, but in the absence of states’ rules, the Coast Guard rules — 
well, rule.
Knowing the Coasties’ rules gets you a long way toward being a safe boater, 
and if you master all 300 pages of them, you’ll have gone a long way toward 
earning a captain’s license. You can download a free copy of these rules at 
www.navcen.uscg.gov/mwv/mwv_files/NR_Files/navrules.pdf.
To study individual states’ rules, you can visit boat-ed.com. This Web 
site provides boater safety training to satisfy many states’ safety education 
requirements.
 
A note on terminology: The rules refer to your boat and all other boats as ves-
sels. A vessel is any floating thing that you use to transport yourself on the 
water. A bathtub could be a vessel if you sit in it with a paddle and use it to 
cross a waterway! You also need to keep in mind the following distinctions:
 
✓ Stand-on vessel: This vessel is often called the “privileged vessel” in the 
rules. If it were a car, it would have the right of way.
 
✓ Give-way vessel: This vessel is often called the “burdened vessel.” It has 
to give way to progress of the stand-on vessel.
Boating’s golden rule: No right 
of way on the water
The Coast Guard rules were devised for the sole purpose of helping the cap-
tains of vessels avoid collisions. These rules set expectations for each captain’s 
handling of his or her craft. But, unlike automobile traffic rules and laws, boat-
ing rules have one very important disclaimer: Nothing in the rules excuses a 
vessel captain for failure to take all necessary actions to avoid a collision.

161
 Chapter 9: Rules Do Apply: Navigating to Avoid Collisions and Confusion
What this means is that even though a captain may technically follow the 
rules all the way up until the point of collision, following the rules doesn’t 
relieve him or her of responsibility if some other action could have avoided 
the collision. In other words, a boater can’t stand on right-of-way rules if 
he could have avoided the collision by yielding or giving way, to use the 
Coasties’ vernacular. It’s almost like the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you.”
So the rules aren’t set laws that captains can enforce with the horn or 
their finger or other insulting gestures, like car drivers commonly do. (You 
wouldn’t do that, would you?) However, the rules do set forth terms to indi-
cate who has the greater obligation for maneuvering to avoid a collision: 
stand-on vessel versus give-way vessel. I define the terms in this section’s 
introduction.
Maintaining a proper lookout
You may think it’s kind of dumb to require a boater to maintain a lookout, but 
you’d be surprised how many boaters let their boats travel in one direction 
while they look in another. The wide-open spaces of lakes, bays, and oceans 
often lull boaters into a sense of feeling that they’re the only ones out there.
If you collide into another boat, the shore, or a bridge abutment — all things 
I’ve seen happen — your citation from the authorities will probably include 
the line, “Failure to maintain a lookout.” Here are the stats on the lookout rule:
 
✓ Where this rule applies: In all inland and international waters and in all 
conditions of visibility.
 
✓ Exceptions: None.
 
✓ Special requirements: In conditions of poor visibility, maintaining a 
proper lookout is only possible while maintaining a safe speed. For most 
foggy conditions or in hard-driving rain, a safe speed is often idle speed. 
Additionally, if your boat is equipped with radar, you should use it as 
part of your lookout.
Crossing paths with another vessel
The rules for vessels crossing paths with other vessels are a little like the 
rules for automobiles meeting at intersections. In boats, the vessel approach-
ing from your right is the stand-on vessel and has the privilege to pass first 
(see Figure 9-1). Following are some basics on the scenario of crossing paths:
 
✓ When this rule applies: Whenever a risk of collision exists between two 
vessels on courses that may cross paths.

162
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
 
✓ Exceptions: None.
 
✓ Special requirements: The rules state that if there’s any doubt that a 
risk of collision exists, the risk shall be deemed to exist. Just thinking 
there’s a risk essentially establishes that there is one.
 
✓ Stand-on or privileged vessel: This vessel is approaching you from the 
right. The captain is showing you his or her left side, which is the side 
bearing the red navigation light (see the later section, “Light colors and 
locations on the boat”). I like to think of it as “seeing red”: When you see 
red, you stop, just like on the highway.
 
✓ Give-way or burdened vessel: This vessel is approaching you from the 
left, and the captain is showing you the green navigation light, which 
effectively gives you the green to go ahead.
 
When you’re the stand-on or give-way vessel in a particular encounter, you 
can’t change your status by changing your course and veering around to one 
side in order to approach from another angle. Your status in any situation 
with another boat is determined by your relationship to the other boat at your 
first sighting of it. That’s when you determine your risk of collision.

sels behave 
when cross-
ing paths.

Overtaking a vessel
A vessel overtaking another vessel (see Figure 9-2) doesn’t technically have 
the right or the go-ahead to do so unless the overtaken vessel agrees to it. 
Agreement is established with horn or whistle signals or via radio, as I out-
line in Table 9-1.

1 short

“I want to pass you on your

on the starboard side.
5 short
Overtaken
The captain either doesn’t under-
stand the overtaking vessel’s inten-
tions or believes that overtaking is 
unsafe under the circumstances.
 
Be aware that the signals for passing in international waters are different than 
those for passing in U.S. waters. In international waters,
 
✓ For a portside pass, the signal is one prolonged blast followed by one 
short blast.
 
✓ For a starboard pass, the signal is one prolonged blast followed by two 
short blasts.
Here are some stats on the rules for overtaking another vessel:
 
✓ When this rule applies: Overtaking rules ordinarily apply only when 
navigating in a narrow waterway, such as a river, canal, or channel 
dredged in shallow water, because these waterways are like highways 
with traffic coming both ways in a relatively narrow space. In open 
water, it’s much easier to veer far away from the overtaken vessel and 
overtake it without impacting traffic in any direction.
 
✓ Exceptions: A vessel coming up from behind your vessel that veers far 
out to your starboard side and then swoops back in front of you doesn’t 
change status from overtaking to crossing. It’s still an overtaking vessel 
and must abide by these rules.
 
✓ Special requirements: The vessel overtaking has to do so at a safe 
speed, with the captain mindful of his or her wake. Passing another boat 
and pummeling it with a large wake is bad manners, not to mention dan-
gerous and against the law.

164
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
 
✓ Stand-on or privileged vessel: The vessel being overtaken is always 
the privileged vessel in the encounter. The privileged captain should 
not unduly prevent the overtaking boat from passing and should hold 
course to allow the passing, presuming the captain agreed to it in the 
first place, which should be the case unless he or she knows of dangers 
that the overtaking captain can’t see.
 
✓ Give-way or burdened vessel: If you’re overtaking, you’re responsible 
for getting the stand-on vessel’s permission to overtake before doing it 
safely and without shaking up the other boat with your wake.
 
To be honest, you seldom hear horn signals anymore. I think that’s partly 
because many boaters don’t bother to learn what they mean and therefore 
don’t bother to use them. Unfortunately, it’s an unsafe situation. As a safe 
alternative to sound signals, many boaters today rely on VHF radio communi-
cations instead. If you’re monitoring your VHF, you may hear a boater call for 
a “one-whistle pass,” meaning he or she wants to pass on the other boater’s 
port side. That other boater may respond by saying that a one-whistle pass is 
fine with him or her. That’s often the only hint of horn and whistle signals on 
the water today — and it’s okay to handle it that way as long as communica-
tion and coordination are the goals.

 Chapter 9: Rules Do Apply: Navigating to Avoid Collisions and Confusion
Meeting another vessel head-on
Vessels approaching each other from a head-on heading are in a meeting 
situation. Both captains should steer their vessels to the right to avoid a col-
lision. Chances are you’ll do this instinctively because of your automobile 
driving habit of staying on the right.
Here’s the lowdown on the rules for meeting head-on:
 
✓ When this rule applies: Any time vessels are approaching each other 
from a head-on or nearly head-on heading, the rule applies. If you’re 
unsure whether you’re on a collision course with a vessel, the rules say 
to assume you are on one.
 
✓ Exceptions: None.
 
✓ Special requirements: The rules state that each captain should make a 
deliberate and obvious course correction so the approaching vessel’s 
captain can see the change and thereby understand the other captain’s 
intentions. If one captain does this before the other one, the approach-
ing vessel is required to follow suit.
 
✓ Stand-on and give-way vessels: These terms have no meaning in this 
situation. Both vessels are expected to show equal consideration to the 
other in getting by safely.
Keeping your speed in check
For most foggy conditions or in hard-driving rain, a safe speed is often idle 
speed. When overtaking another vessel (refer to the section “Overtaking a 
vessel”), you should maintain a safe speed and be particularly mindful of 
your wake.
For nighttime boating, the first thing you need to remember is to slow down 
to a safe speed. The U.S. Coast Guard often refers to “safe speed” but never 
specifies what that is; they simply direct you to choose a “safe and prudent 
speed,” which I’m sure you agree means slower in the dark. Your local state 
laws, however, may indeed specify nighttime speed limits. I’ve seen some set 
at 5 miles per hour and some set at 30 mph.
 
In the absence of a posted speed limit, a safe speed is a judgment call that 
must be made by the captain. One thing I’ve observed about myself in boat-
ing is this: If I have a sneaking feeling that something in my piloting is going 
wrong, a downward speed adjustment usually cures the feeling.

166
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
Reading Boat Lights
Boats don’t have headlights, and there are no lines on the waterways. It’s 
difficult to see things that get in your way at night or in bad weather, in par-
ticular. The rules don’t distinguish between low visibility due to nighttime 
boating and low visibility due to fog, rain, or sleet. They specify operating 
procedures for boats in “restricted visibility,” period.
When it comes to bad weather, I recommend that you just don’t boat in the 
fog or heavy rain, but you probably will, either out of a sense of adventure or 
because you inadvertently get trapped out in the fog. (I discuss the dangers 
of navigating bad weather in Chapter 11.)
When boating in any conditions, but particularly in the dark or low visibility, 
the key concern is seeing and interpreting boat lights. You need to employ 
your boat’s navigation lights to let other boaters know where you are and 
which way you’re headed, and you need to understand the same about them.
 
There are often many, many lights along the shore, and they tend to interfere 
with your perception of other boats’ navigation lights, a situation that calls for 
added care. I discuss navigation lights that aren’t on boats later in this chap-
ter, in the section “Understanding Navigation Markers.”
Light colors and locations on the boat
Your boat lights may not be obvious in daylight, but at night, your lights are 
visible for miles if they’re up to National Marine Manufacturers Association 
(NMMA) standards (see Chapter 3 for more on the NMMA). In this section, I 
explain the basic navigation lights and what they mean. You can see a typical 
configuration of navigation lights in Figure 9-3.
Light configurations for power boats include a combination of red, green, and 
white lights, as follows:
 
✓ Red: This is a bow or side light on the port (left) side of the boat. It’s 
designed to shine in an arc from the tip of the bow to behind the helm 
station (or driver’s seat).
 
✓ Green: This is a bow or side light on the starboard (right) side of the 
boat, where it shines over the same arc as the red light on the port side.
 
✓ White: All boats have either one all-around white light or two lights that 
combine to make a white light visible 360 degrees around the boat. An 
all-around white light is usually located on the stern or back of the boat. 

167
 Chapter 9: Rules Do Apply: Navigating to Avoid Collisions and Confusion
If two white lights are used, one is usually somewhere near the middle 
(midships) and the other is on the stern.
 
✓ Yellow: Boats towing or pushing other boats are required to display a 
yellow light facing aft toward the rig being towed. There could be a great 
distance between the tow boat and the towed boat, so crossing paths 
too close to a yellow light is a bad idea until you’re sure of the position 
of both the tow vessel and the towed vessel.
 
Most states have rules about when you need to turn on your lights. These rules 
often mimic traffic rules, such as turning on your headlights at sunset or 30 
minutes before sunset. Check your local boating rules and comply with them.

Interpreting the lights you see
In daylight or clear boating weather, a boat’s lights may not be obvious, but 
chances are, at night you won’t see any part of another boat but the lights. 
Knowing what these navigation lights mean is the trick to safe nighttime navi-
gating. After you’ve taken a few night excursions, determining what the lights 
are showing you will become second nature, like reading a traffic light. Here’s 
a rundown of light combinations and their meanings:
 
✓ A red light and a white light mean the boat is approaching you from 
your right. The red light also means you must give way or stay out of the 
way. Usually when you meet a boat showing you its red light, you treat it 
like a red traffic light: Stop, or better yet, get out of the way.
 
✓ A green light and a white light mean the boat is approaching you from 
your left. Green means go, and you have the right to proceed. But the 
rules say don’t push it: If you don’t think the other vessel will give way, 
move yourself.
 
✓ A red and green light visible at the same time mean a boat is headed 
directly at you. You’ll also see a white light over the colored lights. Don’t 
pause to think too long in this situation — turn hard to one side or the 
other or, if you’re stopped, get moving out of the other boat’s path. In 
a meeting situation, steer to your right; the other captain should do the 
same. You should both do it decisively enough that you can clearly see 
each other’s intentions.
 
✓ A white light means the boat is either heading away from you or at 
anchor — and you’re heading right for it. Unless its anchored or you’re 
overtaking it, you don’t need to take action unless the other boat sud-
denly shows its colored lights as well, indicating the captain has turned 
around and there may be risk of collision.
 
Remember that boats don’t have headlights. They’re actually illegal, and it’s 
also illegal to travel a waterway with a spotlight shining the way. If you’re 
stopped, you’re allowed to use a spotlight, but be careful not to shine it at 
other boats, because it will disrupt their captains’ night vision, which is also 
illegal.
Understanding Navigation Markers
Navigation markers are a lot like the lines on the roadways, stop signs, and 
yield signs. They have a look and a language all their own, though, and you 
need to get the basics down quickly or you’ll find yourself hard aground or 
under the hard stare of a Coastie or local water cop. You could even get a 
ticket for not observing navigation markers.

169
 Chapter 9: Rules Do Apply: Navigating to Avoid Collisions and Confusion
 
Some navigation markers are lighted, making them visible at night or in condi-
tions of low visibility, but others aren’t lighted, so you need to keep your eyes 
peeled at all times for markers of any kind. Day markers are unlighted markers 
that mark safe waterways or places to avoid in your boat. These markers 
appear on posts and buoys, depending on current, depth, and what the mark-
ers need to say.
 
If you’re in waters that you can navigate by unlighted markers only in the day-
time, then you shouldn’t be out on these waters at night. Although commercial 
boats and some yachts have night vision equipment and radar that can spot 
these markers, making navigation easier and safer for them, boating at night in 
treacherous waters is best left to the professionals (with the exception of an 
idle speed cruise for the evening).
In this section, I explain the most common navigation markers — lighted and 
unlighted — and what they mean. When you take your boater safety course, 
you’ll get the full lowdown on all the markers in your locale.
Intracoastal Waterway markers
Certain markers measure about 1 meter across and are posted on wood or 
metal pilings. When boaters are pointing them out, they often say, “There’s 
the sticks, there.” These “sticks” mark a channel that runs from New England 
around Florida to Texas. It’s called the Intracoastal Waterway, or ICW.
The two kinds of ICW markers are a red triangle and a green square (see 
Figure 9-4). The different shapes help you distinguish between these markers 
even if you can’t tell what color they are. The numbers on the marks corre-
spond with numbers printed on charts so that you can tell where the heck you 
are (I discuss using charts in Chapter 10). So what does each ICW marker mean?
 
✓ Red, even-numbered triangles signify the side of the channel closest to 
the mainland. If you disregard them, you may ground your boat in shal-
lows or encounter other obstructions.
 
✓ Green, odd-numbered squares are always closest to the open-ocean 
side of the channel, even if there’s land between you and the ocean, 
such as an island. If you disregard them, you could hit obstructions or 
get lost. Green ICW day markers often have matching green lights to 
help guide the way at night. On a chart, lighted markers are noted by a 
small, light bulb–like symbol.
Other channel and navigation markers
Local channels that lead into private moorings or community canals are sup-
posed to be marked with triangles and squares that are noticeably smaller 

170
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
than ICW markers (refer to the preceding section). But sometimes they 
appear to be the same size, which makes it confusing when the channel inter-
sects with the ICW. In that case, you may need to consult a chart.
 
If you can’t distinguish intersecting channel markers because they all appear 
to be the same size, check to see if the numbers are consecutive. If the last 
green, square, odd-numbered marker you saw was number 9, the next one 
should be 7 or 11. If not, then you’re probably looking at a marker for the 
intersecting channel and not the ICW. But that’s a little like playing craps, so 
you should consult a chart — unless you can clearly see where the string of 
markers leads.
In addition to posted sign markers, channel and navigation markers may 
appear in the form of buoys and lights.
 
Figure 9-4: 
Red (left) 
and green 
(right) 
ICW day 
markers.
 
Buoys
Some intersecting channels and most rivers are marked with floating buoys. 
They make life easier because these buoys are noticeably different from ICW 
sticks. Four types of these buoys exist:
 
✓ Both red and green: Intersecting channel buoys have red-over-green 
marks or green-over-red marks (see Figure 9-5). If red is on top, treat 
it like a red mark. If green is on top, treat it like a green mark. (If this 
sounds confusing, read on to find out precisely what red and green 
marks mean.)
 
✓ Red “nun” buoys: I think these conical red buoys sometimes look like 
Russian nesting dolls. But somebody else must’ve thought they look like 

171
 Chapter 9: Rules Do Apply: Navigating to Avoid Collisions and Confusion
nuns, because that’s the nickname that stuck — I’m sure they meant no 
disrespect. Red “nun” buoys, shown in Figure 9-6, are even-numbered 
and mark the outermost right side of a channel or river as you enter it. 
As you enter a river going upstream, you should keep the nun buoy on 
your right or starboard side, between you and the shore.
 
✓ Green “can” buoys: No mystery about what these look like: green cans 
(see Figure 9-7). They mark the left side of a channel or river as you 
enter it from the sea or other large body of water. Green can buoys are 
all odd-numbered. Naturally, if you head downstream or return to sea, 
as the case may be, you want these buoys on your right side.
 
✓ White and red or white and orange buoys: When you see these warn-
ing markers, stop, determine what warnings or directions are marked on 
them, and obey them or risk a collision, a ticket, or both. Here are some 
examples of warnings indicated by such buoys:
 
• Keep away from underwater obstructions.
 
• Keep out of a particular area, such as a swimming area or an envi-
ronmentally sensitive area.
 
• Heed special navigation restrictions, such as speed limits or zones 
that require “no wake” or “idle speed only” operation.
 
There are two old sayings to help you remember which side of the boat you 
should keep red and green buoys on as you navigate into a harbor channel or 
river: “Red right returning” means to keep the red ones on your right when 
returning to the channel, and “green going out” means to keep the green ones 
on your right when leaving a river or channel. Leaving a river always involves 
going downstream.

Bridge and other navigation lights
Bridges have lights showing you where it’s safe to pass underneath, but you 
still need to know the bridge clearance, which is indicated on a chart or sign 
posted on the bridge. Green bridge lights show where it’s safe to proceed 
under a bridge. Red lights indicate the boundaries of safe passage. As you 
approach the bridge, you’ll see both colored lights. Pilot your boat under the 
green ones.
Partially submerged obstructions like floating breakwaters and other man-
made obstructions are required to be marked with white lights.
 
Green lights on dry land mean you’re probably too close to shore and are 
seeing a traffic light. Backtrack! (I’m sort of kidding, but I have boated in 
places where you could see traffic lights along the water.)

Finding Your Way on the Water
In This Chapter
▶ Charting your way safely on the water
▶ Using a tried and true navigation tool: The compass
▶ Keeping in touch via VHF radio
▶ Using sonar and radar for safety (and for finding fish)
▶ Navigating with GPS gear on smaller waters
C
hristopher Columbus didn’t need any of the navigation devices we have 
today. He stumbled upon the New World with the most rudimentary 
tools, and I bet he would have given his right arm for a Cracker Jack spy com-
pass and a sixth-grader’s hand-sketched world map homework project. He 
checked his depths (which is called taking soundings) by tossing a lead sinker 
on a line overboard and measuring the line when the lead hit the bottom.
Today, for less than the price of an MP3 player, you can buy more navigating 
power than the early astronauts had — and in a very compact package. It’s 
called a Global Positioning System (GPS), it costs as little as $100, and it can 
pinpoint your position anywhere on earth and clearly display it on an LCD 
screen. For another $100, you can get sonar so sophisticated you can spot 
big fish and tell them from the little ones before wetting a hook. More impor-
tant, with GPS and sonar, you can keep your boat and crew safe from ground-
ing and on the best route to wherever you want to go. Yet many boaters still 
don’t think they need this equipment, and most don’t even know how to use 
a basic compass.
I can’t teach you the detailed intricacies of the complex and fine art of sea 
navigation, but I can get you across a lake. I can tell you what tools you need 
for safe, simple navigation, where to get them, and how to teach yourself to 
use them. By the end of this chapter, I hope you’ll see the logic of getting 
(and knowing how to read) a compass and a chart of your waters and maybe 
even sonar and GPS units. I also tell you what you can expect these tools to 
tell you. And maybe I can even talk you into a VHF radio, so that you can tell 
your friends and other boaters that you absolutely do know where you are!

174
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
Charting Your Course Over 
Big and Little Waters
A chart of your boating waters not only helps you navigate more safely, but 
it can help you more easily discover cool places to take your boat. In the 
old days of piracy, or just good old kingdom-to-kingdom warfare, charts of 
unknown waters were among the most important booty. Charts are almost as 
valuable today.
You may expect to need a chart for traveling offshore — say, to the Bahamas — 
but you’ll also find inland coastal waters like the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) 
difficult to navigate without a chart. (Not familiar with the ICW? Check out the 
sidebar, “Get to know the ICW.”) Sure, there are plenty of landmarks, but the 
channels twist and turn, and even if the route only veers a few degrees, that’s 
enough to put you deep in a sandbar if you don’t veer with it.
The hardest argument to win is for buying a chart mapping smaller lakes 
when a boater often can see every shore from any one spot. You need to 
keep in mind that even though the water may look flat and easy to navigate, 
the bottom of the lake it covers may be crazy with rocky outcroppings, long 
rocky areas called reefs, and sandbars. Without a chart, you have to find 
them by trial and error — a very expensive method.
This section is about what charts can tell you and how you as a recreational 
boater can use them to keep the wet side of your boat down and the propel-
ler turning. It also tells you how to use charts for fishing and gives sources 
for finding the fish if you get stumped.
Understanding chart basics
Charts are based mostly on depth soundings and surveying information com-
piled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). That 
information is kept in digital format and updated for changes almost daily. 
The NOAA’s primary charge is to provide navigation information to commer-
cial mariners, so waters non-navigable by commercial traffic aren’t always 
surveyed. Paper charts you buy locally at your marina or marine accessory 
or tackle store — whether strictly for navigation or with key fishing spots 
marked on them — most often come from the NOAA data. You can purchase 
two types of paper charts:
 
✓ Nautical charts: Available to help you find your way in most commercial 
waters
 
✓ Fishing charts: Often available for waters that aren’t navigable (in other 
words, they aren’t big and deep enough for ships); make a good substi-
tute for nautical charts

175
 Chapter 10: Finding Your Way on the Water
 
As you may imagine, charts are obsolete in small ways almost the moment 
they’re printed. Currents shift sands, and storms move islands. For example, 
during Hurricane Charlie in Florida in 2004, Captiva Island was cut in two, and 
entries to some ports were filled by the storm’s currents. When one channel 
to a harbor on Captiva Island was redredged, it was 75 feet from its original 
location! When you’re venturing into an unknown area, I recommend that you 
check in with local boaters (at the marina or marine accessory or tackle store) 
for local knowledge and compare it to your chart. Despite small inaccuracies, 
charts are still mandatory for safe navigation because they’re the best infor-
mation available at any given time.
Using navigation or nautical charts
On a navigation or nautical chart, you can virtually visit your new favorite 
boating waters, visualize the courses to the places you want to visit, and make 
mental notes of the appropriate channels to use and the boat-crunching rocks 
and reefs to avoid. Almost everything you need to know about unfamiliar 
waters is on a navigation chart.
Charts are readily available for navigable waterways, which simply are those 
used by commercial marine traffic. These waters include the oceans, coastal 
waterways, Intracoastal Waterway, inland rivers, and the Great Lakes. 
Smaller landlocked lakes not open to commercial waters are considered non-
navigable (but are almost always still usable for recreational boating) and 
sometimes aren’t as easy to find charts for. That’s changing quickly, how-
ever, because private entities are compiling maps of non-navigable water-
ways for consumer and government use.
When you want to know where the channels are, what the markers mean, or 
how high a bridge over the water is, charts have the answers and much more. 
Get to know the ICW
The Intracoastal Waterway, called the ICW by 
most mariners, is a popular water route among 
recreational boaters, but it was initially cre-
ated in 1919 to aid commercial marine traffic by 
offering protected waters on which to navigate 
in rough weather. The ICW runs from the south-
ern tip of Texas, around the U.S. coast of the 
Gulf of Mexico and around Florida, and up the 
East Coast to Maine. The route connects many 
natural rivers and bays as well as manmade 
canals to make a continuous route around the 
Atlantic and Gulf coasts.
Funding for the ICW was to come from marine 
fuel taxes, but the cost of maintaining the route 
has far exceeded that funding, and in some 
places, shoaling (the result of sand drifting 
and piling up in waterways, blocking them) has 
caused the ICW to fill in to depths as shallow as 
7 feet. Whenever you navigate — or just plain 
play in — the ICW, it’s a good idea to check 
with knowledgeable boaters for local informa-
tion on the condition of the waterway. Note any 
concerns on your chart.

Following is the lowdown on navigational chart contents; knowing what infor-
mation is on charts makes using them practically self-explanatory.
 
✓ Cardinal directions: A compass rose printed on the chart tells you how 
the chart is aligned with respect to magnetic north and true north (see 
the sidebar “True north and magnetic north” for more details). The com-
pass rose looks a bit like a sundial and is usually printed in rose-colored 
ink. It’s marked in the 360 degrees of all points of the compass, including 
north, south, east, and west, giving the casual navigator (you and me) 
a visual guideline for navigating between points. Accomplished naviga-
tors use a variety of tools in conjunction with charts to determine exact 
courses to the next destination on their trips.
 
✓ Geographic “lay of the land”: A navigation chart tells you where land 
ends and water begins. It clearly identifies every bend in the river, every 
cove off the shore, and any islands in the region. Coastal cities and com-
munity canal systems are all on navigation charts, too. You get land-
marks as well as indications of cool places you may like to explore.
 
✓ Depth soundings: Deep water is white or very light blue on charts, 
whereas shallow water is a progressively darker shade of blue (it’s dark-
est where it’s most shallow). Numbers scattered throughout the water 
are depth soundings that indicate how deep the water was at mean low 
tide when the depths were last measured for charting purposes.
 
✓ Local channel markers: Out in a channel, red triangles with even num-
bers and green squares with odd numbers mark each side of the chan-
nel. Your job is to go between them, keeping green on the right going 
out and red on the right returning to port. The number of each marker 
is reflected on the chart so you can find yourself on the chart by the 
marker number. (Turn to Chapter 9 for coverage of channel markers and 
other navigation laws.)
 
✓ Intracoastal Waterway (ICW): A popular water route among recre-
ational boaters, the ICW runs from the southern tip of Texas, through 
the Gulf of Mexico, around Florida, and up the East Coast to Maine. This 
waterway is marked by red, even-numbered triangles and green, odd-
numbered squares on stationary pilings. These ICW markers are similar 
to but usually larger than local channel markers (see Chapter 9). When 
you stay between the red and green marks, the green marker will always 
be closest to the open ocean, and there will usually be land between you 
and the ocean. The number, shape, and color of each marker is reflected 
on the chart, so if you’re near buoy number three, for example, you can 
find it on your chart and know your position.
 
✓ Buoys: Floating buoys sometimes mark channels in lieu of triangular and 
square markers on pilings. They’re numbered and marked on charts for 
the same reasons as other channel markers.

177
 Chapter 10: Finding Your Way on the Water
 
✓ Obstructions: Wrecks, reefs, and rock piles are marked on charts and 
their depths noted. Some obstructions have physical markers on them 
in the water, and information about the markers and their meanings is 
noted in fine print on the corresponding mark on the chart.
 
✓ Bridge or power line heights: Most power boaters don’t have to worry 
about clearance for most bridges and power lines. But some lines and 
bridges are low even for boats without sails and masts. That’s why all 
overhead obstructions and their heights over the water are noted on 
charts. (On a bridge itself, a clearance gauge indicates the exact clear-
ance height at any given tide.)
 
For most casual boaters, just knowing the lay of the land, depths, obstruc-
tions, and channels is enough for safe boating. But the more you use a chart 
when boating, the more you imprint that information in your mind’s eye. 
You’ll soon find many other interesting details in charts that may help you 
navigate more effectively. There’s much more to navigating waterways and 
charts than I discuss in this section, but considering that most casual boaters 
don’t even have a chart, let alone know what it can tell them, you’re a step 
ahead of those misguided navigators if you use charts.
Using fishing charts
For inland waters, I’ve found that the best charts are printed for fishermen. 
You may be hoping to avoid an underwater obstruction, but anglers abso-
lutely want to find one because such obstructions usually hold fish.
Many inland waters are considered non-navigable and therefore may never 
have had navigation charts made for them. Oh, you can boat in these waters, 
and you should, but like an oversized pond, there’s no way to get your boat 
outside the shores except with a trailer. So a 5,000-acre lake in northern 
Minnesota may not have a navigation chart, but the U.S. Geological Survey 
(USGS) maps it, and that information is used to produce fishing maps with 
surprising detail.
 
Sometimes actual navigation data, like channels, markers, bridge height, and 
other structures, is sadly lacking from fishing charts. In that case, you should 
use a navigation chart in conjunction with a fishing chart.
Here’s a little of what you can expect from fishing charts:
 
✓ Fishing charts usually (but not always) have all the information of NOAA 
navigation charts — if NOAA charts on the particular waters exist.
 
✓ Some fishing charts are based on USGS information. The USGS surveys 
aren’t conducted with navigation in mind but rather focus on terrain fea-
tures. Maps based on this information may not have sound navigational 
information.

178
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
 
 USGS–based maps often have more detailed depth information than nau-
tical charts and show contours of the land under the water.
 
✓ Being created by fishermen, for fishermen, fishing charts mark histori-
cally productive fishing holes, points, bays, and sometimes underwa-
ter springs bringing in cool water that can attract fish in the heat of 
summer.
Where to buy your charts
Charts are usually available from marine and tackle retailers. You can also 
buy them from the government, and in some communities, I’ve found accu-
rate navigational charts as promotional giveaways paid for by local advertis-
ers. Here’s a rundown of some sources:
 
✓ Local sources: Most boating communities have charts available through 
marinas, tackle stores, or boating accessory stores.
 
✓ Free sources: Local chambers of commerce may have basic navigation 
maps with at least rudimentary detail available at no charge.
 
✓ Online sources:
 
• www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov: This Web site identifies 
sources for downloadable charts and local sources for buying 
charts. These sources are often digital operators who print out a 
chart when you request it, resulting in a chart with up-to-the-minute 
changes.
 
• www.fishinghotspots.com: This company has an extensive 
selection of fishing maps, with pretty good navigation information, 
too. The site lets you purchase charts for many coastal, intrac-
oastal, and inland waterways that are printed on waterproof paper 
that can stand up to tough abuse.
Finding True North (And the 
Way Home) with a Compass
Fewer and fewer boaters know how to use a compass. And fewer and fewer 
boats come with a compass as standard equipment or are ever equipped 
with one later. With often two GPS units available onboard for redundancy 
and a handheld stowed for backup, it’s easy to see why a compass may seem 
needless.

179
 Chapter 10: Finding Your Way on the Water
I, too, felt that compasses were unnecessary until I once went 25 miles off-
shore in a new boat on a mostly sunny day and followed my course on the 
GPS. I fished for several hours, moving at random but mostly easterly, when 
scattered clouds joined to form threatening thunderheads and hid the sun. 
When I turned for home, I noticed the GPS wasn’t working. My untried com-
pass was the only way back.
I set the boat on an easy idle in a straight line, pointing at what I hoped was 
the west, and watched the compass settle. It agreed with my choice, and I 
nervously hunkered down for the 30-minute ride to get back in sight of land. 
If the compass had failed due to my negligence in not checking its accuracy, 
I could’ve traveled farther into the Atlantic, run out of gas, and drifted until 
someone noticed I was gone.
That confession made, in this section I tell you what to look for in a compass 
and how to get some basic directions from it — in other words, what I should 
have done on that cloudy fishing day. Then please do what I say, not what I did!
Discovering how a compass works
A compass won’t tell you how to get home. All it can do is point north by 
aligning itself with the earth’s magnetic poles — one to the north, one to the 
south. Fortunately for navigators, pointing north is something even inexpen-
sive compasses do with reassuring regularity. Here are a few more details to 
brush up on to master your compass:
 
✓ Cardinal directions: North, east, south, and west are called the cardinal 
directions. They’re arranged on the compass dial, which is called the 
card, in a clockwise fashion.
 
✓ A matter of degrees: There are 360 degrees counting from zero, which is 
north, to 90, which is east. South is 180 degrees from north. West is 270 
degrees from north. The compass dial is divided into degrees so you can 
plot a course in any direction between any two of the cardinal directions.
 
✓ Always points north: When you turn your boat, your compass card 
rotates to always point north. The adjustment pulls the direction of your 
course into view on the compass and aligns it with the mark on the front 
called a lubber line (see Figure 10-1).
Navigating with a compass
Using a compass isn’t as hard as trusting it. There’s much more to compass 
navigation than I can tell you here, but hopefully this section helps you see 

180
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
the possibilities and at least crack open the compass instruction manual to 
bone up on navigating the way Columbus did. If you don’t already have a 
compass, I may even get you thinking of shopping for one.
For using a compass in the most rudimentary way, you first need to check it 
for accuracy against known landmarks. In this section, I fill you in on how to 
do that and then tell you how your compass can help you find your way while 
boating.
Checking your compass for accuracy
 
Every time you launch your boat, the first thing you should do is check your 
compass — assuming that your boat came with a compass or you bought one. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Point the boat toward something you know to be a specific direction 
in degrees from your position.
 
 Suppose the harbormaster told you the enormous water tower outside 
the harbor is on a course of 110 degrees from the harbor inlet. Point 
your boat in that direction and watch the compass. It should settle on 
110 degrees, which is between east and south (yep, call it southeast).
 
2. After traveling maybe a quarter mile toward that landmark, check 
your course on the compass. It should be holding at the expected 
degree.
 
 In this example, you should travel toward the water tower and check that 
your compass holds at 110 degrees — if the harbormaster was correct.
 
Figure 10-1: 
A compass 
shows your 
course in 
alignment 
with the 
center mark, 
called the 
lubber line.
 

181
 Chapter 10: Finding Your Way on the Water
 
3. Reverse your course and head back to the harbor in what’s called the 
reciprocal course. The reciprocal course is the original course plus 
180 degrees.
 
 In this example, your compass should swing to 290 degrees (110 degrees 
+ 180 degrees = 290 degrees). Sometimes your compass can vary more 
from magnetic north in one direction than in another, so this test of the 
reciprocal course helps give you a feel for compass variations.
 
4. If your compass is off by more than a couple degrees from the 
expected degree on the outbound course, and if you’re planning to 
travel great distances out of sight of land, you should adjust it accord-
ing to the directions packed with your compass — or risk missing your 
destination by much more than a mile.
Letting your compass lead the way
Like most boaters, you may go on visual references in all but the most 
adverse conditions, and in adverse conditions like fog and blinding rain, I 
hope that you stay in port. But if you’re caught away from port when bad 
weather rolls in, you may find yourself relying on your compass to find your 
way home. Here are some tips for using it:
 
✓ Familiarize yourself with landmark headings, and mark them on a 
chart. Check these landmarks against your compass and jot down notes 
on locations. Sometimes the information is offered by other sources 
you trust, like a charter captain or a marina operator or harbormaster. 
Suppose your favorite waterfront hamburger joint, the Clown, is at 90 
degrees or due east from the ramp. Find the Clown on the chart and jot 
down “90 degrees from the ramp.” Do this for all the most visible land-
marks, and soon you’ll be able to find them with your compass even 
when they aren’t visible because of darkness or fog.
 
✓ Your reciprocal course from a charted landmark will take you home. 
Take the course to the landmark and add 180 degrees to find your 
course back to port. If you’re at the Clown when a fog rolls in, take the 
90-degree course plus 180 degrees; your course back is 270 degrees or 
due west.
 
✓ Travel at a prudent speed. When poor visibility requires navigation 
by compass, proceed slowly so you have as much time as possible to 
maneuver to avoid an oncoming boat. Keep one eye tuned to your sonar, 
too, just to make sure you don’t ground yourself. (I talk more about 
sonar later in this chapter in the section, “Scanning the Unseen Depths 
with Sonar.”)

Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
Choosing the right compass for your boat
Some boats come with compasses installed, but if yours doesn’t, your budget 
and the complexity of your boating will determine the kind of compass you 
should buy. Even though today’s $10 compass is likely better than the one 
Columbus used, you don’t want to handicap yourself with inadequate equip-
ment. Here are some practical guidelines to help you choose the right com-
pass based on the way you boat:
 
✓ In smaller inland waters: Less detail in a compass used in small lakes 
and rivers is okay, because most of the time you’ll be navigating by 
visual references. Naturally, a compass for this sort of boating will be 
the least expensive option.
 
✓ In larger waters or night boating: The more you rely on your compass, 
the more detailed it should be. On larger waters, a more detailed com-
pass is important. But even if you boat on smaller waters, you may boat 
frequently at night, making a larger, more detailed compass useful. A 
compass with a card divided in 5 degrees or even a full 360-degree card 
is best because you may not have clear lights and landmarks to navigate 
by. Compasses in this class are naturally a little more expensive because 
of added detail, but they’re still affordable.
 
✓ On large, choppy lakes, oceans, and bays: If you’re making 5- to 10-mile 
runs from shore to shore, it’s not unlikely you’ll wind up on the wrong 
side of the lake in a blinding rain. Choose a compass with a metal base 
and a large lighted dial. Better compasses are more stable (less jiggly or 
jumpy to read), easier to read, lighted . . . and just look really cool on the 
helm station — you know, where the wheel, ah, helm is! Even at a premium 
price, this kind of compass is a good value for the safety it provides.
True north and magnetic north
Few people are aware that the true north pole 
is quite a long way from the magnetic north pole 
and that the magnetic north pole keeps drifting 
ever so slightly away from the true north pole 
every year. Some scientists theorize that even-
tually the poles will swap ends, north for south, 
causing quite a disturbance for the inhabitants 
of earth. But don’t worry, the poles aren’t apt to 
swap ends for thousands of years.
But beyond its value in a trivia contest, the 
earth’s shifting magnetic pole does have a 
practical application to mariners. A great mari-
ner or even just a recreational boater interested 
in having a very accurate compass should 
follow some very specific steps to be sure his 
or her compass is properly aligned to magnetic 
north and not reacting to magnetic fields in the 
boat. Each compass comes with the directions 
to adjust it for maximum accuracy and to com-
pensate for the local difference between true 
north and magnetic north.

Understanding the Value of VHF Radios
I think few boaters worth their salt would go out without at least a handheld 
VHF (very high frequency) radio. I may cut you some slack if you boat on a 
small lake in the north woods of Wisconsin and if none of your peers have a VHF 
radio — and if you carry a cellphone programmed with emergency-responder 
numbers. But if you boat in any coastal waters or on waters frequented by com-
mercial traffic, you’re doing yourself — and your fellow water people — a dis-
service by being unequipped to communicate with them. In this section, I help 
you choose the radio that’s right for you and give you some tips for using it.
Turning on and tuning in
VHF radios aren’t expensive, and you have a few good choices to consider, 
plus additional options for your radio antenna. Not surprisingly, the more 
you spend, the more features you get and the better the service.
Handheld VHF radios
Handheld radios are easy to find and convenient to use. Here’s what you can 
expect:
 
✓ Cost: Usually about the same as an average MP3 player.
 
✓ Rechargeable batteries: Most handhelds have base stands with char-
gers. Some have an AC adapter plug with a charger that plugs into the 
wall. Either works fine.
 
✓ Many channels: Handhelds have all or nearly all the channels of a fixed 
radio, including channels to receive NOAA regional weather forecasts.
 
✓ Built-in antenna: The beauty of handhelds is their simplicity. You don’t 
have to pay an installation charge for the antenna or the radio.
 
✓ Transmit range: Most handhelds can transmit and receive calls for 5 
miles, but their range is limited by mountainous or hilly terrain.
 
✓ Disadvantage: The limited range of a handheld VHF radio makes it best 
for inshore use and for offshore boating, as a backup to a fixed radio.
Fixed VHF radios
Fixed radios are the best way to go if you have the cash and space in your 
boat. Here are some things to consider:
 
✓ Cost: You can purchase a VHF radio for the price of a nice dinner at a 
restaurant, but you also need to budget for an antenna and maybe instal-
lation costs, potentially tripling your investment, depending on your 
equipment.

184
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
 
✓ No batteries to recharge: Fixed radios run on the batteries already in 
your boat.
 
✓ Maximum channels: Fixed radios usually have all the channels avail-
able, plus an ability to scan them silently for transmissions and then 
stop on the active channel.
 
✓ External antenna: An external antenna requires installation, but the 
added height of the antenna improves transmitting and receiving range.
 
✓ Transmit range: Fixed VHFs have more transmitting power and longer 
range. It isn’t unusual for a fixed radio with an antenna rising 10 feet to 
reach out 25 miles or more.
 
✓ Disadvantage: If boat trouble occurs due to battery failure, chances 
are there won’t be enough juice to run your radio, either. (This makes a 
good case for keeping a charged handheld VHF onboard for backup.)
DSC-equipped VHF radios
Most fixed radios now have a function called digital select calling (DSC). 
Connect one of these radios to a GPS (which I discuss later in this chapter), 
and the radio will monitor your latitude and longitude. Register your DSC-
equipped radio with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and 
then if you get into trouble, you can use a very handy panic button to make 
your radio continually transmit your position and the fact that you have 
declared the need for assistance, making it possible for help to find you 
quickly. Other DSC radios on other boats in the area will repeat the signal, 
automatically multiplying your chance that responders will hear you. To reg-
ister your DSC radio, visit boatus.com/mmsi.
Antennae for fixed radios
A fixed VHF radio requires the installation of an external antenna. The 
antenna often has more impact on the quality of transmission and reception 
than the radio itself. Here are some things to consider when selecting and 
installing an antenna:
 
✓ Antenna height: The higher your antenna, the longer the distance 
your radio can transmit and receive signals. A larger boat has the sta-
bility to handle a taller, heavier antenna without breaking it, whereas 
smaller boats react more to chop and seas and transfer the stress to the 
antenna. A 6- to 8-foot antenna is ideal for most boats under 40 feet.
 
✓ Mounting location: A 6-foot antenna mounted on the side or gunwale of a 
boat doesn’t have the longer range of one mounted on the hardtop shad-
ing the passenger area. Always mount an antenna as high as you can.

185
 Chapter 10: Finding Your Way on the Water
 
✓ Mounting bracket: Buy the heaviest mounting bracket you can find for 
your antenna. Plastic brackets may seem fine on inland waterways, but 
just head over a cruiser wake once without slowing down, and the jolt 
may make the bracket snap off. Choose a bracket that lets you raise and 
lower the antenna when transporting your boat.
 
✓ Cost: An antenna can cost up to three times the price of your radio, 
depending on length, strength to resist whipping back and forth in chop, 
and the quality of the wiring components. Choose a stronger one than 
you think you’ll need because if you break an antenna and you don’t 
know how to replace it yourself, the cost of professional installation 
can be triple the cost of the antenna. Add another $50 or so for a strong 
bracket.
Communicating between boats
 
There’s a protocol to speaking on radios, and many other boaters will be 
quick to broadcast their objection to any infraction of the protocol. When you 
call another vessel, obeying protocol makes things easier for everyone.
Getting the right VHF channel
You can monitor the dozens of available VHF channels, but you should trans-
mit only on the few I list here:
 
✓ Channel 16: This channel is for emergencies and ship-to-ship calling. 
Most commercial ships and recreational boats monitor this channel. 
When you call another boater on this channel, the protocol requires you 
to agree to switch quickly to a noncommercial, nonemergency channel. 
When you’re boating, your radio should always be on and tuned to chan-
nel 16 to hear emergency advisories or respond to others’ emergencies.
 
✓ Channels 71, 72, and 78: For noncommercial calling, these are the chan-
nels you should switch to for conversation.
 
✓ Channels 78A and 79A: These channels are for noncommercial commu-
nications only on the Great Lakes.
 
When you’re entering a marina or passing under a drawbridge, the harbor-
master or bridge tender will be monitoring a specific channel for your call. 
Directions to use these channels are usually posted on a bridge or commercial 
signage posted by a harbormaster.
For a complete listing of VHF channels and their uses, visit www.navcen.
uscg.gov/marcomms/vhf.htm.

186
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
Calling others on your VHF radio
As I say in the preceding section, you can call another craft on channel 16 to 
get its attention, but you should quickly switch to a noncommercial channel 
to continue your communications.
When calling ship to ship, your call should sound something like the follow-
ing. Suppose your boat is named Little Boy and you want to call a boat named 
Big Boy:
 
1. On channel 16, say, “Big Boy, Big Boy, Big Boy, this is Little Boy, 
over.” If you’re calling a boat that’s not expecting your call, repeating 
the name helps limit the number of callbacks by giving the other skip-
per a better chance to hear what you said.
 
2. If you don’t know the boat’s name, then the skipper doesn’t likely 
know yours. You may address your call to “Sea Ray 300” or “Big blue 
boat” or some other descriptive term and say, “This is Little Boy off 
your port bow.”
 
3. Big Boy should respond, “This is Big Boy. Switch to channel 71 [or 
72 or 78], over.” If you called for “Big blue boat,” the skipper may 
respond with the boat’s real name.
 
4. You should say, “Switching to 71.”
 
5. Over on channel 71, you can proceed with your conversation normally.
The radio frequencies and airways are governed by the FCC, and laws require 
you to use the radio politely and without profanity and to yield the channel if 
someone has a more pressing need. In other words, use common sense and 
good manners, and don’t yack away on it as if it were a closed cellphone circuit.
 
Transmit an emergency message using the ship-to-ship protocol I explain in 
the preceding steps, but substitute “Mayday!” for the other ship’s name in life-
threatening or boat-threatening situations and “Pan-pan!” for less-urgent situ-
ations. Also include your position and the nature of your emergency. Chapter 
12 contains a complete dialogue for sending emergency messages.
Scanning the Unseen Depths with Sonar
Sonar is so inexpensive and so useful to boaters that many boat builders 
make it standard equipment. If your boat doesn’t have it, you can buy inex-
pensive sonar units with monochrome LCD screens for around $100 or spend 
thousands on units capable of penetrating thousands of feet of water and 
returning detailed images of the bottom contour and fish in between.

187
 Chapter 10: Finding Your Way on the Water
Recreational-quality sonar is so detailed that volunteers using it are often 
responsible for finding stolen cars abandoned in the depths or recovering 
accident victims. But for most recreational boaters, sonar’s primary ben-
efit comes from helping you avoid grounding. This section tells you how to 
choose the sonar unit that’s right for you and get the best use of it.
 
Whether you get into fishing or just use your sonar for a convenient method of 
staying out of trouble, read your sonar owner’s manual. It tells you all you can 
expect your sonar to reveal and how to get it to give more detail in its read-
ings than you can imagine.
Seeing how sonar depth finders work
If you saw the movie The Hunt for Red October, you saw sonar in action. The 
lake or ocean bottom returns most of the signals, but if a fish (or submarine 
Red October) swims between the lake or ocean bottom and the transducer 
mounted on the bottom of the boat, it gets painted on the screen at its 
respective position. It seems like a miracle, but sonar has been available to 
sport fishermen since the early 1970s. Today a dozen or more companies 
make good sonar equipment.
Sonar depth finders transmit a signal through a transducer on the bottom of 
the boat. Think of a transducer as an antenna sending and receiving a signal. 
The sonar system works something like this:
 
1. The sonar unit creates a signal or ping.
 
2. The transducer mounted on the bottom of the boat passes the signal into 
the water in a cone shape. For the transducer to work correctly, it has to 
be in contact with the water, and no air can be between the transducer 
and the water. Your installer will handle that for you.
 
3. When the ping echoes back, the transducer hands it to the sonar unit, 
which calculates the time lapse between when the ping was sent and 
when its echo returned. With that information it can accurately calculate 
the distance the ping traveled to the bottom.
 
4. The depth is displayed on the screen. Depending on the unit you have, 
it may just display a number in feet or meters, depending on how you 
program it, or it may give you a graphic drawing of the contour of the 
bottom of the lake or ocean.
Choosing the right sonar unit
Sonar units can be as inexpensive as $75 for a monochrome LCD display 
perfectly suitable for most lakes, rivers, and saltwater bays. A top-of-the-line 

188
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
unit that can draw detailed graphs of the bottom contours and fish deep in 
the ocean can cost over $2,000, though. Some are so detailed they can draw a 
clear image of a sunken boat, log, or — well, whatever’s down there!
Sonar units get progressively more expensive as you include more of the 
following features:
 
✓ Larger screens: Big screens are more fun to look at (just like your TV) 
and give a better view of the bottom.
 
✓ Color LCD screens: Color gives a more detailed image of the bottom 
structure, giving anglers a better idea of what’s below.
 
✓ Bright displays: Screens that can be easily read in bright sunlight cost 
more than those that are dimmer.
 
✓ Dual-beam transducers: Multiple-frequency pings enhance sonar’s 
ability to operate efficiently in shallow and deep water, giving a more 
detailed image in both.
 
✓ Digital transmitters: The more frequencies the better — at least, that 
seems to be the latest trend to get greater detail in sonar imaging, which 
is primarily important to anglers. Digital sonar transmitters add more 
frequencies and detail.
 
✓ Multiple transducers: Some sonars have multiple transducers and com-
puters to analyze and compile the data. These tranducers look forward 
and down, and some scan 180 degrees from port to starboard. The latter 
kind can tell you if fish are hovering 30 yards or more from where you’re 
fishing and let you go cast bait on them.
Using sonar
If you’re unfamiliar with waters, you can avoid grounding by traveling at a 
prudent speed and paying attention to your depth sounder (sonar unit). A 
sounder’s screen may look like something from an airplane cockpit at first, 
but sonar really is easy to use and understand. Here are some tips to keep in 
mind for working your sonar system:
 
✓ Let an automatic sonar unit do its thing. Most sonar units are auto-
matic, which means that the unit determines how much power — called 
gain — it should transmit based on depth and other factors it detects in 
the water. It also automatically adjusts settings to eliminate interference 
and change the scale from, say, zero to 30 feet to zero to 60 or 90 or 120 
feet as you move to deeper water. All you do is turn on the unit.
 
✓ Be alert for a shallow water alarm. Some sonar units have a shallow 
water alarm that beeps when your boat enters water shallower than a 
preset depth you select.

189
 Chapter 10: Finding Your Way on the Water
 
✓ Be aware of your unit’s time lag. Keep in mind that sonar has a time lag 
between the moment the depth is actually sounded and the report of 
depth. This lag is tiny, but at 45 miles per hour, if your sounder suddenly 
reports a depth change of 20 to 10 feet, don’t wait for it to reach 5 feet to 
slow down. Chances are, if a sandbar is coming up that quickly, you’re 
already in 5 feet of water or less.
Spotting fish with sonar
Anglers were the first recreational boaters to appreciate sounders because 
they help find sunken logs or boats or other underwater obstructions that 
fish like to hang around in. They can even spot fish.
Fish love to hang out at the edge of drop-offs or around logs. By cruising 
slowly along a likely shoreline with your sonar going, you can quickly dis-
cover whether such fish-attracting obstructions are there. On the sonar 
screen, they’ll jut up abruptly from the bottom, often looking like a cross sec-
tion of their actual shapes.
Fish appear on sonar screens as marks floating over the obstructions or the 
bottom. Sometimes you’ll find fish suspended far above such obstructions or 
farther offshore but at exactly the same depth as the obstruction. You’ll have 
to ask the fish why they do this — I certainly don’t know.
Using GPS Chart Plotters
The U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS) is a navigational miracle. With a 
basic $100 receiver to collect and analyze signals from GPS satellites circling 
the earth, you can pinpoint your exact location on earth — within a few feet. 
GPS units are so inexpensive that they’re commonplace in cars and even 
more commonplace in boats.
This section gives you a basic idea of how GPS devices work and how you 
can use them while boating. Of course, you can’t use one if you don’t have 
one, so I prepare you to go shopping for one, too.
How GPS units work
Mariners used to navigate by the sun and the stars. Based on centuries of 
observation, they knew where to expect the stars to be. Using a tool called a 
sextant, they measured the angle of the triangle created by the horizon, the 
heavenly body, and their boat’s position. They then used a trigonometric 

190
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
calculation to determine roughly where the boat was in relation to a star or 
the sun. It was a rough calculation, too, often only good to within dozens of 
miles. GPS uses nearly the same math but has a much better system of arriv-
ing at a position. I won’t go into the math, but it helps to have a basic idea of 
what’s happening with what components when you turn on your GPS.
 
✓ Satellites: At least 24 satellites are in the U.S. GPS system, and they orbit 
the earth in a predictable pattern, transmitting their position to GPS 
receivers on earth.
 
✓ Receivers: A GPS receiver can receive signals from all the satellites 
within the horizon or sight of the receiver’s position on the earth. 
Receivers have to be in sight of the sky to receive a signal, meaning they 
often don’t work indoors or in the cabin of a boat.
 
✓ Calculating a position: A computer in the GPS receiver calculates its 
position, based on the information received from the visible satellites, 
and displays latitude and longitude.
 
✓ Leaving a trail: The GPS information is useful only if you keep the unit 
running and let it leave your trail marked on the screen. You can then 
follow that trail back by watching your position change on the screen 
and keeping your position aligned with the trail.
 
✓ Chart plotters: GPS units with navigational charts preloaded in them 
will coordinate your position or latitude and longitude with an animated 
chart on the screen, and you can easily visualize your exact position and 
watch it change as your boat travels onward. Some GPS units also can 
display charting information, but you have to plug in a card that carries 
the data. Various manufacturers make these charts; Navionics (www.
navionics.com) and C-Map (www.c-map.com) are reliable GPS chart 
providers if your GPS doesn’t include charts.
Choosing the right GPS for you
GPS units are getting more and more inexpensive, but their prices climb as 
you start adding features such as the following:
 
✓ Larger screens: Big screens are easier to understand in a moving boat.
 
 Your helm station has limited space for a GPS chart plotter, so you need 
to keep that in mind and not buy a screen that you can’t use.
 
✓ Color LCD screens: Color adds some cost, just as in sonar depth finders. 
Color screens give you a clearer picture of bottom contours and naviga-
tional markers, and some even display satellite maps in full color. A color 
screen gets dim as direct sunlight floods it but can be shielded from direct 
sunlight in order to provide a more detailed image of chart features.
 
✓ Bright displays: Color screens easily read in bright sunlight cost more 
than those that are dimmer.

191
 Chapter 10: Finding Your Way on the Water
 
 In an open boat with no cover for shade, a monochrome LCD display is 
the easiest to read — and the least expensive.
 
✓ Charts: Some GPS units have all the charts you’ll ever need built right 
into them. Others have more basic maps, and to get the detail you need, 
you have to get chart cards, which are electronic storage devices that 
plug into the unit. Charts cost extra in some GPS units.
 
✓ Fixed mount units: Most GPS units have an external antenna that has to 
be in sight of the sky for consistent accuracy. Plan to mount the anten-
nae at any convenient place where it has an unobstructed view of the 
sky. Some GPS units have integrated antennae and don’t require external 
ones as long as they have a clear view of the sky from the helm.
 
✓ Combination units: Some GPS units also have sonar systems built in. 
Such a unit combines functions on one screen by splitting the screen, 
kind of like a TV with picture-in-picture capability. Some combo units 
are capable of displaying navigation, sonar, and radar all at once. (I 
talk more about radar in the section, “Letting Radar Spot Things Far in 
Advance,” later in this chapter.)
 
Many a boat is navigated by a handheld GPS. The integrated antenna and por-
tability mean handhelds work fine in open boats. Plus they’re cheaper, run on 
AA batteries for 20 hours or more, and don’t require installation, making them 
useful for hiking as well as boating. You can get a 12-volt power cord for your 
handheld GPS to plug into the boat’s system and avoid batteries altogether. 
You can even get an external antenna, but by then you’re jacking the price up 
to the level of some fixed units.
Finding your way with GPS
If you have a GPS chart plotter loaded with a local chart, you can simply turn 
it on, give it time to establish communication with satellites, and then see 
where you are on the map. But you can do a lot more with such a device to 
make boating more fun and safe. Here are some tips and suggestions for get-
ting the most out of your GPS:
 
✓ Turn on your GPS while you’re prepping your boat for launch so it 
will be ready when you launch. GPS units take up to five minutes to 
establish communications with satellites. If a GPS unit is turned off and 
transported several hundred miles, communication often takes even 
longer next time it’s turned on.
 
✓ Use the GOTO function. If you have a chart installed on your unit, GOTO 
is a function that lets you use a mouse-like device to scroll the cursor 
on the on-screen chart over a place you want to go to. Then you press 
GOTO, and it sets the course, plots a line to it, and shows you when 
you’re off or on course.

192
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
 
✓ Familiarize yourself with the Man Over Board (MOB) function. MOB 
is sort of like a panic button you push when somebody (or maybe just 
a baseball cap) falls overboard. You’d be surprised how difficult it is to 
spot something again after you turn your boat around. MOB marks the 
spot on a chart to help you return to it easily.
 
✓ Follow trails and tracks. Your GPS leaves tracks, or what I call a bread-
crumb trail, on the screen to mark where you’ve been. It’s a beautiful 
thing because you can retrace the trail on the GPS and get back again. If 
your boat icon on the screen strays from the line, you can easily steer it 
back in line with the trail.
 
✓ Record waypoints. On your GPS, you can record the position of spots 
you like or spots you think you’ll want to return to. You can even name 
these spots and give them a customized little picture or icon to reflect 
home, fishing hole, ramp, fuel, food, or whatever else. Later, you can 
highlight them with the cursor and, at the push of a button, set a course 
for the waypoint.
 
✓ Watch the speedometer. A GPS can display your speed because it not 
only knows what your position is but how fast it’s changing. It’s actually 
more accurate than most speedometers on boats!
Letting Radar Spot Things 
Far in Advance
Most recreational boaters don’t need radar, but the bigger the boat, the more 
likely it is to have radar onboard. It has to be mounted well overhead of the 
captain and crew to give a clear signal and avoid hitting people with the radi-
ation it transmits, both of which are good reasons to avoid radar on smaller 
boats. Offshore fishermen and women love it for spotting unseen flocks of 
birds diving for baitfish — a sure sign of hot fishing action. For example, I 
have radar on my 25-foot offshore fishing boat.
In this section on radar, I give you the layman’s 411 on how it works, how you 
may find it useful, and what to look for in a radar for your boat.
How radar works for you
Radar works on the same principle as sonar (refer to the earlier section, 
“Scanning the Unseen Depths with Sonar”), but it works above the water 
instead of under it, sending out horizontal pings and waiting for echoes to 

193
 Chapter 10: Finding Your Way on the Water
return. Radar calculates the time between transmission and the time the 
echo is returned and then calculates how far the echo traveled. It then plots 
that on the radar screen, showing how far away other boats or land or other 
obstruction is. Some radar arrays let you automatically track a target. That’s 
handy when you think a boat may be approaching you and doesn’t know 
you’re there. Radar helps you visualize the other boat’s course and its pos-
sible crossing of yours.
The radar array spins 360 degrees, fanning signals around the boat that 
travel to infinity unless they hit something that returns the signal in the form 
of an echo. The signals see things in every direction and far beyond the abil-
ity of the human eye, even with binoculars.
 
Radar can see when you can’t; it shows you things in fog, dark, and even blind-
ing rain that you can’t see unassisted. Its value in adverse conditions is ines-
timable. Birds, boats, land, rain squalls, and even navigational markers you 
can’t see in the dark show up well on radar. When you’re forced to travel in 
fog, nothing beats the peace of mind radar gives.
Choosing the right radar for your boat
Radar devices are smaller than ever and getting more and more inexpensive. 
So it’s not surprising that captains of progressively smaller boats take advan-
tage of it these days. But there are some limiting factors to consider before 
you buy a radar system:
 
✓ Radar mounting: You need a radar arch or hard top over your boat’s 
cockpit on which to mount the radar array. This placement gives the 
signal enough height to be effective and keeps the array from pointing 
the radar signal at passengers. If you don’t have an arch, you can have 
one mounted on your boat at a cost of several thousand dollars, which 
may be prohibitive.
 
✓ Radar power: Your radar range is partly dependent on its power and 
partly on the installation and height of the array. Consult a navigation 
electronics installer when you consider radar for your boat to make sure 
the power is optimal for your boat.
 
✓ Helm display: A radar screen is needed to display a radar array’s infor-
mation. If your dash has room for a GPS and sonar and radar, you’re all 
set. If not and you want radar, choose a GPS/sonar unit capable of dis-
playing radar, too.

Navigating Bad Weather
In This Chapter
▶ Finding weather forecasts for your boating day
▶ Taking heed of small craft warnings and advisories
▶ Adapting your plans to forecasts and weather conditions
▶ Handling your boat when you’re stuck in bad weather
I
t may seem pointless to include a chapter about boating in bad weather 
when most likely you’ll try to avoid it. But there’s a real chance that you 
could get caught in bad weather — in fact, if you boat long enough, you defi-
nitely will. If you’re a fisherman, you know the fish often bite best during the 
approach of a weather front, so you may just choose to dodge in under an 
approaching front, hook some fish, and go home. But believe me, if you’ve 
been caught in your boat in a thunderstorm once, you’ll avoid them at all 
cost and in spite of any expected reward.
This chapter is about keeping yourself out of weather trouble and how to plan 
your boating around great weather. I show you where to go for boating and 
marine advisories so you can maximize safe weather conditions and avoid 
unsafe conditions. And, because eventually you will be caught in a storm, I 
explain how to proceed to shelter as quickly and safely as possible, as well as 
how to forge through stormy seas in the event that you face them head-on.
Tuning In to Marine Forecasts 
Before You Go Out
Weather manages to surprise even the experts, even though meteorologists 
calculate their forecasts after analyzing ground radar, satellite imagery, and 
uncountable data from numerous ground stations. Sure, the experts still get 
it wrong, patterns take an unusual shift, and a storm diverts to a different 
location than expected. But the odds are that most of the time the weather 
forecasters will get it right, and your odds for safe boating are better if you 
follow their advice.

196
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
 
In general, you should start checking the kinds of sources I discuss in this sec-
tion a few days before your boating trip. That way you can watch fronts come 
through on radar and satellite maps and develop your own feel for what your 
boating weather will be.
Finding local marine forecasts has never been easier. In addition to local 
news sources, you can access 24-hour weather channels, numerous govern-
ment and private weather forecasting Web sites, and radio broadcasts trans-
mitted around the clock. Even some Global Positioning System (GPS) units 
can receive real-time weather forecasts (I discuss GPS in Chapter 10). In this 
section, I outline the sources of weather news available for boaters and offer 
suggestions on which sources provide the best information for your region.
Checking weather on the Web
The Internet is chock-full of weather-reporting Web sites. Most are based 
on information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA), the federal agency responsible for monitoring atmospheric condi-
tions, weather, and the health of oceans and oceanic fisheries.
When preparing for a boating outing, check the following sites, which I’ve 
found to be the most useful and accessible:
 
✓ www.weather.gov: The National Weather Service site, maintained by 
NOAA, quickly links you to the marine forecasts for any coastal or Great 
Lakes region. To get to marine forecasts, click “Marine” on the left menu 
bar. A map pops up with red dots on the chart that immediately connect 
you to forecasts in the region. The regional forecasts provide all the 
basics you’d get from the newspaper or local news plus all the informa-
tion boaters need, such as wind, waves, approaching fronts, and other 
changes expected in the weather. The information is almost exhaus-
tively detailed but totally useful for safe navigation.
 
✓ www.wunderground.com and www.weather.com: Their information 
is based on data compiled by NOAA, but they package it in an easier-
to-access format, making them very popular with boaters even though 
they’re not as detailed.
 
 These commercial Web sites provide
 
• Coastal reports, including saltwater bays and coastal waters up to 
20 miles offshore by region
 
• Great Lakes reports containing weather and wave conditions
 
• Inland weather reports that can help you predict inland water 
conditions, because conditions that are unfavorable for any land-
based activities are equally so for boating in lakes and rivers

197
 Chapter 11: Navigating Bad Weather
Using VHF and weather radios to 
monitor weather on the water
NOAA broadcasts weather 24/7 on various radio bands, giving the most 
up-to-the-minute marine and inland advisories. You can get these forecasts 
on your VHF marine radio, which I recommend you buy. But, a household 
weather radio also carries these broadcasts.
Special VHF channels, accessed by touching a button on your VHF radio 
marked “WX,” carry weather broadcasts regularly. Local Coast Guard sta-
tions notify listeners on channel 16 whenever weather predictions are apt to 
change. Keep your VHF radio on channel 16, and for the details on a particu-
lar announcement, simply press the WX button again. (I discuss VHF radios 
in more detail in Chapter 10.)
Inexpensive weather radios receive just the weather channels and often offer 
the added feature of sounding a weather alarm from the National Weather 
Service before automatically turning on and reporting severe weather fore-
casts. In coastal areas, weather radios report on marine conditions as well.
Locating weather information on your GPS
A new form of weather information has emerged that links certain GPS sys-
tems with satellite radio providers like XM and SIRIUS.
Only certain brands of GPS units interface with satellite radio providers’ 
weather services, and each requires a special module to be connected to the 
navigation system.
Here are a few brands offering satellite weather interface at the time of this 
printing:
 
✓ Garmin: Garmin GPS systems link with satellite weather to give all the 
weather information available from ground radar, satellite imagery, and 
NOAA weather buoys almost as soon as it’s measured and transmitted. 
In addition, XM Radio provides NOAA information that measures water 
temperatures, phytoplankton content, and other factors to predict 
where fish that seek certain conditions may be found.
 
✓ Raymarine, Furuno, Northstar, and Lowrance: These GPS systems link 
with SIRIUS Satellite Radio to display what the providers call real-time 
radar and satellite imagery, in addition to the latest information from 
NOAA weather buoys, giving the state of winds and seas through SIRIUS 
Satellite Radio.

198
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
These systems conveniently overlay satellite weather information right on 
your GPS chart plotter screen, coordinating radar and satellite images over 
the chart of your location. XM Radio also identifies promising fishing grounds 
on your chart plotter so you can navigate directly to those waters.
 
In time, I expect many other brands and models to begin connecting to satellite 
weather information. For offshore and Great Lakes boaters, the capability can 
be so useful that it makes a very wise investment both for added fun (espe-
cially for anglers) and increased safety.
Knowing about Warnings and 
Advisories for Small Crafts
A small craft isn’t defined by its weight, length, or beam (width), but instead 
it’s any boat (including large ships and yachts) that can be adversely affected 
by the conditions of the waves or seas, wind, and precipitation like fog, rain, 
snow, sleet, or hail. Is your boat a small craft? The short answer is yes. If 
you’re reading this book, you’re going to be piloting a boat that should heed 
a small craft advisory.
Chances are that as a pleasure boater, when an advisory is issued, you aren’t 
going to ask the question, “Is it okay to go?” Your reaction will be more like, 
“Sure doesn’t sound like much fun. Why go now?” The latter is the appropri-
ate response to a small craft advisory.
Taking small craft advisories seriously
Nothing puts the brakes on a day of boating like a small craft advisory tell-
ing you that a prudent boater would keep off the water. Watch and listen for 
these advisories in whatever source you use for your weather information 
(Web sites, weather radio, GPS, and so on).
 
Your check of weather and boating conditions prior to leaving the dock may 
show that conditions are great for boating, but the Coast Guard may issue a 
small craft advisory over the VHF radio when you’re already out on the water. 
Keep yours tuned channel 16 to pick up any advisories that develop.
Small craft advisories are advice, not commands, and you have to exercise 
judgment about the conditions, your experience, and your capability to 
handle them in your boat if you decide to go out (or stay out) anyway.

199
 Chapter 11: Navigating Bad Weather
Knowing regional advisory differences
Small craft advisories are issued for the Great Lakes, U.S. coastal waters, and 
the high seas — waters beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The conditions that trigger 
these advisories vary by region and are set by the NOAA. The regional defini-
tions in this section include information from www.noaa.org.
General elements that factor into an advisory include the velocity of the 
wind and the size of the waves. In each of the following regions, certain local 
areas within a given region have more or less restrictive definitions, and 
you should check them at your nearest Coast Guard station. If you think the 
language is a little stiff, you must have skipped Chapter 9 on the U.S. Coast 
Guard’s rules of the road — or sea! You can download a free copy of the 
navigation rules at www.navcen.uscg.gov/mwv/mwv_files/NR_Files/
navrules.pdf.
 
✓ Eastern region: Maine to South Carolina, including Lake Erie and Lake 
Ontario, are combined in this broad region. In general, small craft 
advisories are issued when “sustained winds or frequent gusts range 
between 25 and 33 knots and/or seas or waves 5 to 7 feet and greater.”
 
✓ Central region: On the Great Lakes from Minnesota to Ohio, “sustained 
winds or frequent gusts between 22 and 33 knots inclusive, and/or seas 
or waves greater than 4 feet” form the threshold of an advisory. This 
region includes all the Great Lakes.
 
✓ Southern region: This enormous region ranges from the coast of 
Georgia, around Florida, all along the Gulf of Mexico to Texas, and the 
Caribbean. Advisories are generally issued in conditions of “sustained 
winds of 20 to 33 knots, and/or forecast seas 7 feet or greater that are 
expected for more than two hours.”
 
✓ Western region: This region extends from California to Washington. 
Advisories are issued for “sustained winds of 21 to 33 knots, potentially 
in combination with wave heights exceeding 10 feet (or wave steepness 
values exceeding local thresholds).”
 
✓ Alaska: An advisory is issued for “sustained winds or frequent gusts of 
23 to 33 knots. A small craft advisory for rough seas may be issued for 
sea/wave conditions deemed locally significant, based on user needs, 
and should be no lower than 8 feet.”
 
✓ Hawaii and Samoa: Advisories are issued in the presence of “sustained 
winds 25 knots or greater and seas 10 feet or greater.”
 
✓ Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands: “Sustained winds 22 to 33 
knots and/or combined seas of 10 feet or more” trigger an advisory.

Taking Precautions When 
the Forecast is Bad
Superb, detailed, and up-to-the-minute weather information is out there to 
be nabbed by anyone with a laptop or a VHF radio. You no longer have to 
look at the sky and wonder “Red sky at night, sailors in fright” — or was that 
“sailors’ delight”? (By the way, that old saw works only in tropical regions 
anyway.) This section poses some common-sense strategies for dealing with 
the uncertainties of the weather.
Tweak your departure or destination plans
Many boaters go out with a false sense of security, assuming that because a 
weather forecast predicts thundershowers at 2:00 p.m., they’re safe to boat for 
the morning at least. That’s often not the case. Plan simpler, shorter boating 
if forecasts show conditions deteriorating later in the day. Or postpone your 
boating outing and go to a movie instead. There’s always another day to boat.
I’ve had to disappoint my crew when we expected to boat to a favorite desti-
nation and looming weather interfered. Even though visible signs were good, 
with blue skies, light winds, and a gentle breeze, a forecast calling for deterio-
rating conditions held us close to home. We’ve never regretted playing it that 
way. Predicted foul weather usually sets in as scheduled or even a little early, 
and had we not made a habit of staying tuned to the forecast, we would have 
been trapped in dangerous weather more than once.
Head for port at a hint of lightning
Lightning is always a threat in any kind of rainy weather, and it can appear to 
come from nowhere. Gentle rains with no breeze, light clouds, or no clouds 
are all conditions that have produced lightning.
 
If you’re out on the water and hear thunder in the distance, you’re in range of 
being struck. On a vast expanse of water in conditions that favor lightning, a 
boat may be a prime target.
Don’t expect that because you don’t see any lightning, there’s no risk. 
Definitely don’t go out boating when lightning is present because once you’re 
out in it, you can’t protect yourself and your crew except to get back in port 
and to shelter quickly and safely. Handling your boat in an unsafe manner 
can pose a much greater risk than the lightning itself.

201
 Chapter 11: Navigating Bad Weather
For more on thunderstorms and lightning, see the later section, 
“Understanding the power of thunderstorms and lightning.”
Anticipate sudden weather changes
Keep in mind that a forecast — even one for the best boating conditions — 
can change. If the boating forecast is a good one and you decide to head out, 
take your weather radio with you or keep your VHF tuned to channel 16 to get 
updates or notices to switch to the weather channels for more information.
Secure or relocate your boat 
in named storms
Nobody boats in the face of hurricanes or tropical storms — at least not on 
purpose. Occasionally someone in a sailboat without enough sense or at least 
enough seamanship to get out of the weather gets trapped in such storms. 
Mercy on their souls — and on the souls forced to attempt to rescue them.
You won’t be out in this weather, but you may want to consider securing 
your boat where it’s stored or moving it to a safer place in advance of a 
storm. Insurance providers often require boat owners to do so. Prior to a big 
storm, take the following precautions to secure your boat:
 
✓ Remove your boat cover. I know it sounds crazy, but listen up: 
Hurricanes are defined as having winds over 74 miles per hour. If that 
wind speed is sustained for a period of hours, it will shred your cover, 
and the flapping pieces, snaps, and zippers could further damage your 
boat. Even a tropical storm-strength wind of 39 to 73 mph can damage a 
cover — especially those not designed for trailered boats.
 
✓ Batten down the hatches. It’s an old saw from Errol Flynn movies, but 
there’s truth in it. Anything loose in your boat should be stowed in a 
lockable locker. Seat cushions or carpet held in place by snaps should be 
stowed away or tied down so wind can’t get under it and spirit it away.
Dealing with Weather Conditions
In addition to knowing how to find out about weather in general, you should 
know about the kinds of weather that concern boaters.

202
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
Gauging wind, waves, and seas
In coastal and ocean waters, waves are called seas. In the Great Lakes and 
any other inland waterway, waves are just waves. They’re usually driven by 
wind and, in the coastal areas, by the tide as well. Wakes are another form of 
wave created by the passing of boats. Here are some more details you need 
to know about wind and waves to boat safely in varying weather conditions:
 
✓ Wave height: Waves are measured in height by the distance from the 
wave trough, or low point between waves, to the peak of the wave. When 
the NOAA issues a statement that waves or seas will be 4 feet, they base 
that information on an average of readings taken from weather buoys 
anchored in the ocean. When gauging whether you can handle 4-foot 
seas — and many recreational boats can — remember that it’s an aver-
age: In the period of time during which the average wave height was 
calculated, at least one wave could well have been twice that height. An 
8-footer may not capsize you, but it could easily capsize you if you’re 
not watching for it. And what fun would rough seas like that be, anyway?
 
✓ Wave period: The NOAA may also report the wave period, which is the 
time it takes the peak of one wave to pass and the next wave to arrive. 
Even if there’s no report, you can expect distinct and important differ-
ences between Pacific and Atlantic wave periods. In the Pacific, small 
craft advisories are issued when the wave heights reach 10 feet, yet in 
the Atlantic it takes only 7-foot seas to trigger an advisory. Part of that 
has to do with the longer wave period in the Pacific. It’s much more diffi-
cult to manage 7-foot seas closely spaced — as you crest one wave, you 
plunge down the side of it into the trough and instantly, while you still 
have downward momentum, another wave rises before your bow. To 
understate it, that makes for a pretty wet ride.
 
✓ Winds: Winds are divided into 13 categories defined long ago by a 
noted seaman, Sir Francis Beaufort. In the Beaufort Scale, winds of 18 to 
24 mph are considered a Fresh Breeze. However, just 1 mph over that 
threshold steps into the category of winds in which small craft adviso-
ries are issued. While it may be technically okay to go out in an appro-
priate craft when winds are 1 mph over the Fresh Breeze threshold, you 
can count on the ride being less than fun. (See the sidebar “The Beaufort 
Scale” for more about the story of Beaufort and his scale.)
Understanding the power of 
thunderstorms and lightning
Poking around on www.noaa.gov is one of the best ways to brush up your 
meteorological skills — and gain a respect for the power of bad weather. 
Together, knowledge of the weather and respect for its power will make you 
a better boater.

203
 Chapter 11: Navigating Bad Weather
According to the NOAA, about 100,000 thunderstorms occur in the U.S. every 
year. About 10 percent of them are severe, with destructive winds. There’s 
no way to predict whether a storm will be severe in advance, so you should 
be cautious of all storms and especially their effect on boating. Here are 
some other things I learned from the NOAA (at www.nws.noaa.gov/om/
brochures/ttl.pdf):
 
✓ Thunderstorms are formed when moist air that is warmer than sur-
rounding air rises thousands of feet. At that altitude, cooler atmospheric 
conditions cool it rapidly, causing moisture to condense and fall as rain. 
Lightning is nearly always present, and often hail is as well.
 
✓ Lightning kills 80 people and injures 300 per year. Consider your vul-
nerability to lightning when you and your boat are on a broad expanse 
of flat water and are the most prominent, highest structure for maybe 
miles around. There’s very little you can do to protect yourself from 
lightning except hope for the best, so don’t get caught in it.
 
✓ Hail can be uncomfortable in normal pea- to quarter-sized pieces. But 
larger hail, like the size of golf balls or baseballs, can also fall at a speed 
of 100 mph. Certainly it will damage your boat, and it could also injure 
or kill you or your crew.
Navigating through fog
In most cases there’s no good reason to navigate in fog. Although there are 
ways to lower your risk in doing so, boating in fog is always a little risky. 
Specific rules for navigating in fog are spelled out by the U.S. Coast Guard 
The Beaufort Scale
What’s a little wind on the water? In 1805 Sir 
Francis Beaufort, an Admiral in the British 
navy, wanted to define winds in terms of what 
a casual seaman might observe. You can see 
a table that clearly presents his findings in 
terms of marine and land conditions online at 
www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/
beaufort.html. Even though Beaufort was 
a decorated seaman whose greatest contribu-
tion to navigation was in hydrographic charting 
of unknown waters, he’s still better known for 
his definitions of the forces of wind still used in 
meteorology today.
As a boater, gauging wind descriptions from 
the comfort of your home even without a 
weather radio is easy — just visit lwf.ncdc.

olds listed earlier in this chapter can tell you 
whether weather conditions suggest you take 
a pass on boating that day.

204
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
in their publication Rules of the Road. Most state boating laws are based on 
these rules, which you can find more about in Chapter 9.
I’m sure you’ve driven your car in fog, but as a responsible boater, you need 
to know how to drive your boat in fog as well as recognize conditions that are 
likely to produce fog.
Recognizing fog-generating conditions
There are a variety of scientific explanations for how fog is formed in the 
atmosphere, but here’s the gist of what you should know for boating and 
navigating:
 
✓ The kind of fog that most often impacts boaters (and often automobile 
drivers, too) occurs when cool air drifts downward and meets warmer 
moist air.
 
✓ Fog often happens at night as air over the land cools, and the fog is 
drawn to water by warmer air rising from the water’s surface.
 
✓ Fog often burns off as the sun climbs and changes the weather dynamics.
Fog isn’t always predicted accurately, but the conditions that cause it are, 
and those conditions are reported on most weather forecasts. You just need 
to know what to look out for.
 
When you have a choice of not boating in dangerous weather such as high 
winds, storms, or fog, my recommendation to you — and my personal 
practice — is to avoid boating in it altogether. Fog is something you usually 
meet at the dock, and you can easily wait it out by remaining ashore.
Observing foggy rules for boaters
Despite your efforts to avoid boating in fog, you may encounter times when 
you go boating and find fog between you and safe harbor. In those cases, you 
need to know the rules for handling it.
The Coast Guard’s rules for boaters don’t actually specify rules for navigating 
in fog. They take the much broader approach of specifying rules for navigat-
ing in restricted visibility — which can include heavy rain as well as fog. Here 
are the high points of these rules:
 
✓ Safe speed: Conditions like fog and rain obviously restrict visibility, 
and the rules require you to slow down to a safe speed. They don’t 
specify what that speed is, but you’re expected to make a reasonable 
choice based on how quickly you can see and react to oncoming traf-
fic or obstacles. Generally, if fog restricts your visibility to 50 feet, you 
should go no faster than a speed that allows you to avoid an obstacle 

205
 Chapter 11: Navigating Bad Weather
like another boat, piling, or buoy. To complicate matters, you also have 
to consider the speed of other oncoming vessels; for example, an object 
moving toward you can eat up a 50-foot visibility perimeter faster than a 
fixed object you’re moving toward.
 
 Although the Coast Guard doesn’t define safe speed, trust me, it’s always 
less than 10 mph.
 
✓ Sound signals: The Coast Guard’s rules address sound signals in fog 
because lights aren’t much of a guide in restricted visibility (see the next 
bullet). When moving through areas of restricted visibility, you should 
make one prolonged blast of the horn or a whistle about four to six sec-
onds in length. You should make this signal every two minutes.
 
✓ Lights: Even though running lights aren’t visible very far in fog, they’re 
often visible farther than solid objects — even if only a few feet farther. 
You should turn your navigation lights on when boating in fog.
 
✓ Radar: Radar goes a long way toward identifying other traffic, buoys, 
navigation aids, and navigation hazards. But it isn’t as foolproof as the 
ability to see where you’re going and what’s around you, and you should 
still maintain a speed under 10 mph even if you’re able to navigate using 
radar.
 
✓ Special sounds: If you find yourself in the waterway and unable to make 
progress safely, you should sound two prolonged blasts of the horn or a 
whistle of four to six seconds long with not more than two seconds sepa-
rating the blasts.
 
When it comes to navigation rules you should obey, following the rules I out-
line in this section will give you a leg up on 90 percent of the other boaters out 
there, but the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules are the final authority. You 
can download a free copy of them at www.navcen.uscg.gov/mwv/mwv_

Handling Your Boat in a Storm
Even if you faithfully watch forecasts and monitor weather conditions, it’s 
likely that you’ll eventually get caught boating in a storm.
On any lake or bay, a thunderhead creeping in suddenly sends boaters run-
ning like the devil for cover. On busy waters, all the boats may streak back 
toward one narrow bay opening and may get there all at the same time. 
There’s something about a storm that triggers the flight mechanism in boat-
ers, and while that may be the right course of action, doing so without cau-
tion is not.

206
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
If you’ve followed all the safety precautions I discuss in Chapter 12 regarding 
safety gear, you’ll be able to keep a level head. In this section, I outline what 
to do in a weather emergency.
 
Handling your boat safely in a storm isn’t hard if you keep a level head, but 
that doesn’t mean you should ever purposely take the risk!
Preparing your crew
Getting prepared for the last thing you expected is the first thing you need to 
do when faced with a storm. Here are three steps you should take immedi-
ately before making a beeline to homeport:
 
1. Double-check that your crew is equipped with life jackets. If they 
aren’t wearing them, command them to don jackets immediately.
 
2. Have everyone secure loose items that could bounce around or blow 
out of the boat because of the wind and waves.
 
 Beach towels or swimsuits hanging from railings should be secured 
inside the boat. If a towel were to fall into the water and foul your prop, 
you could find yourself dead in the water when the storm strikes.
 
3. Make sure all your passengers takes a secure seat, and let them know 
that it’s important they remain in it no matter the conditions.
Riding out the storm
If you’re forced to take precautions in dealing with foul weather, it’s probably 
because you’ve gone out in spite of the forecast and what the meteorologists 
warned about has come to pass. But it could be you’ve just skipped the fore-
cast and only recently noticed the weather has crept up on you. Or, in rare 
cases, perhaps the forecast simply didn’t anticipate the storm.
Regardless of who’s to blame, here are some options to consider when you 
have to ride out the storm on the water:
 
✓ Wait it out where you are. If a storm appears between you and your 
port, dock, or launch ramp, don’t make a run for it. According to the 
NOAA, thunderstorms move up to 30 mph. Instead of running through 
the storm, gauge the motion of the storm to see if it will pass you by 
before you head in. On open water, that’s often easier than you may 
think. Many times, I’ve been able to easily skirt storms because, without 
land obstacles in the way, the beginning and end of a rain squall (unless 
it’s a full-blown weather system you shouldn’t have left home in anyway) 

207
 Chapter 11: Navigating Bad Weather
is easy to spot and track. If there’s no observable and clear definition 
of the squall, secure everything and everyone in the boat, sit low to the 
deck, and work your way in at a safe speed.
 
✓ Head offshore or away from port. I’ve known boaters on Lake Erie who 
fished far offshore and decided it was safer to head away from port to 
Canada to wait out the storm than to try to make their way through 
it. They gassed up in Canada and returned stateside when the threat 
passed. Never bulldoze through thunderstorms unless you want a truly 
harrowing and unnecessary experience.
 
✓ Adjust your speed to seas and visibility. You won’t be the only boater 
panicked by a storm. If you’re caught in the storm, heading to port or 
the ramp in poor visibility at maximum speed is more dangerous than 
sitting still in the water until the threat has passed.
 
✓ Radio your position to the Coasties. If a storm overtakes you and your 
situation becomes alarming, notify the Coasties of your position and 
your course of action. They may be able to keep tabs on you and wait 
for your periodic reports. Maintaining radio contact means that if your 
boat becomes disabled, the Coast Guard can begin searching for you in 
the vicinity of your last communication.
 
✓ Use a cellphone. On inland waters where agencies are less likely to 
monitor VHF radio frequencies, use a cellphone to call a friend, family 
member, or marina operator. Marina operators are often the first to be 
sought for advice when people are delayed by a storm.
 
✓ Know when it’s an emergency. If your boat is taking on water, it’s an 
emergency. If your boat is disabled, you may be in an emergency, or you 
may just be experiencing a frightening inconvenience — it depends upon 
the way your boat is handling the weather and whether you think there’s 
risk to your crew. Review the procedures in Chapter 12 for making 
mayday and pan-pan calls.
Handling your boat in rough seas or waves
If you’re caught in a storm out on the open water, one of the hardest things 
you have to do is navigate heavy seas or rough waves. Avoiding seas or 
waves is the better part of safe navigation, but when you can’t, knowing what 
seas can do and what you should do in the face of them can save your life.
 
Many times navigation isn’t possible in seas or heavy waves, and all you can — 
and should — do is hold your position into the waves so they pass under you 
as gently as possible. Pounding into them, often dipping the bow into the next 
wave, will eventually swamp your boat and stall your engine, increasing the 
danger. Letting seas take your craft from behind is even worse.

208
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
Your ocean-going boat is designed to take the seas head-on easily under 
power. Here’s how strong seas affect parts of your boat and cause hazards:
 
✓ Bow: Its sharp stem (the peak of the bow stretching down to the keel) 
is designed to pierce head seas, or waves that come at you from the 
front of the boat. The flare of the hull is designed to deflect the waves 
away while lifting the boat over them. In large waves, as the boat crests 
a wave, it plunges down the face of it into the wave trough. If the speed 
is too great, the next wave could pour over the bow, swamping an open 
boat.
 
✓ Freeboard: The sides of the boat above the waterline are designed to 
keep the water out. Freeboard isn’t the sides of the boat but rather the 
distance on the sides between the waterline and the gunwales (the top 
edges of the boat). When quartering seas hit your boat from behind at 
a 90-degree (or so) angle and turn it so that heavy seas hit the sides 
directly, the waves can push and roll the boat, risking upsetting it.
 
✓ Stern: The stern or back of a power boat is relatively square and flat. 
For outboards and sterndrives, this shape gives the boat more stability 
under power, especially when turning. However, in following seas — 
that’s the nautical term for waves that come from behind — the force of 
waves can push the boat, causing it to heel or tilt over hard to one side.
 
If your boat goes dead in the water in rough, stormy seas, the safest recourse 
is to fasten an anchor to the bow and throw it overboard. Have every passen-
ger sit on the floor as close to the center of the boat as possible because as 
the boat turns, it will heel or roll heavily to one side, and getting the load cen-
tered and low helps combat that. Even in water far deeper than your anchor 
can reach, the drag of the anchor, chain, and rode (the rope on an anchor) 
should turn the boat’s bow into the seas so it can better ride them.
Dealing with head seas
Head seas are what your boat is designed to handle in normal operation. But 
in stormy seas, special challenges require special tactics.
Head seas hit your boat at the bow — the highest part of the boat. High, 
stormy head seas can still break over the bow if you don’t adjust your speed 
for them. Sometimes the waves are so bad that they can still break over the 
boat even when you’ve slowed down as much as possible, making a strong 
case for watching your weather forecast in the first place.
 
Take head seas cautiously. They’ll pass under your boat from the bow, and 
if you press forward too fast, as you crest one wave you’ll slide down its 
face into the trough, leaving yourself vulnerable to the next wave. Take each 
wave as slowly as possible until you’re certain how the boat reacts to them. 
Chances are 5 to 10 mph is the best speed you’ll be able to make over head 
seas, but you should take care when adjusting the speed.

209
 Chapter 11: Navigating Bad Weather
Dealing with quartering seas
Quartering seas come up under the stern or back of the boat from an angle 
instead of dead on, like following seas (see the next section). Most boats 
behave awkwardly in quartering seas, and the larger the seas, the more awk-
ward their behavior.
When quartering seas come behind the boat from the starboard (right) side 
or the port (left) side, they not only push the boat ahead but also push the 
stern aside. The risk is that they’ll push the stern so far aside that your boat 
takes the seas broadside. Then the danger is that the boat will turn over.
 
Follow these steps when facing quartering seas:
 
1. Trim the propellers up slightly to a level or “zero-degrees” trim. 
Rougher waters may require a slightly higher trim setting to one or 
two degrees up.
 
2. As the wave comes under the boat, steer away from it to counteract its 
push to the side.
 
3. As you enter the trough, straighten your course but be prepared to 
quickly steer away from the next wave.
 
Over a great distance, these seas will push you off course. Correcting for that 
may not be possible, and you may be forced to head for a different port.
Dealing with following seas
Following seas that come directly from behind are great under power — if 
you handle them properly. Following seas of small craft advisory proportion 
can be pretty exciting, though.
Following seas come in under the boat and lift it. If the wave period is short, 
however, the boat’s motion from the past wave may fight the lifting, and the 
wave can press against the boat, pushing it or splashing over the transom 
and swamping the boat.
Under power, you should keep the boat moving at a pace equal to the speed 
of the waves, if their height makes it unsafe to cross them. In outboards and 
sterndrives, trim the propeller to an angle that pushes directly in line with 
the boat’s keel; which is called zero-trim angle. In some cases, when the seas 
overtake the boat, it’s best to have the propeller trimmed upward slightly to 
combat the lifting of the waves and hold the bow up to prevent nosing into 
the next wave or trough.
Changing course in stormy seas
Changing course in stormy seas is a tricky maneuver. So tricky, in fact, that 
experienced boaters try to avoid it at all costs. If you have no choice in the 
matter and you have to turn in stormy seas, in following or head seas, you 

210
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility 
can retain control by managing the speed of your craft and trim of your pro-
peller so waves come under the boat directly and with a minimum impact. 
But when turning around in seas, there’s a brief moment when the boat’s keel 
is aligned with the crests of the waves. If that happens in the trough between 
waves, things work out fine. If it happens as a wave crests under the boat, the 
force of the wave can turn over your boat.
This turning maneuver takes timing and coordination and a cooperative crew 
seated on the floor near the centerline of the boat to lower the boat’s reac-
tion to the seas. The trick is to make the turn quickly in the trough and be 
pointing at the next wave before it crests under the boat. Here’s how:
 
1. Gauge the speed of the waves and adjust the speed of the boat to be 
nearly equal to the speed of the waves.
 
2. Inform your crew of the maneuver, and have them sit on the floor 
near the center of the boat.
 
3. As the boat levels out in the trough, simultaneously turn and apply 
additional throttle to speed the turn.
 
4. As the boat finishes the turn, straighten the helm (steering wheel) and 
pull the throttle back to a slow setting.
 
5. Adjust your speed to the new rhythm of the waves.
 
Turning the boat around in seas is a tricky and even dangerous maneuver. It’s 
often better to find a safe port in the direction the seas are taking you, if you 
can. Sometimes, the seas are lighter closer to land, and you can make a course 
correction in calmer seas even though you may be farther from home.

Preparing for and Handling 
Boating Emergencies
In This Chapter
▶ Preparing for a variety of eventualities
▶ Knowing how to deal with common emergencies
▶ Calling for help on the water
▶ Deciding to stay with or abandon the boat
▶ Attempting basic temporary repairs
A
ccidents are often preventable, and the best first aid is being prepared 
for the unexpected. The goal of this chapter isn’t to tell you how to 
be an EMT (emergency medical technician) or a Baywatch superhero. The 
point of this chapter is to help you know when and how to act on your crew’s 
behalf in the most prudent way when an emergency arises.
In this chapter, I give you some tips on being prepared by explaining how to 
have and check the right equipment, how to handle some common emergen-
cies, and how to correctly call for emergency assistance.
Being Equipped for Dealing 
with Boating Hazards
Too often, boaters are ill-prepared for accidents. They leave the dock with-
out properly fitting life vests, working fire extinguishers (or none at all), or 
even an anchor onboard. I’ve rescued boaters and “put out fires” in several 
incidents where they were having problems because their equipment was 

212
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility
outdated or poorly fitted and failed when they needed it. Being prepared 
means having the right equipment onboard and making sure that equipment 
is shipshape, as we boaters like to say. Being prepared also means planning 
ahead and sharing those plans with others onshore so that someone always 
knows what you’re up to.
Checking your safety equipment
In Chapter 4, I describe the essential safety gear you need and how to make 
sure you obtain quality stuff. These items include:
 
✓ First-aid kit
 
✓ Anchors
 
✓ Fire extinguishers
 
✓ Life jackets
 
✓ Life preservers
 
✓ Paddles
For some reason, many boaters consider this safety gear optional. What a 
mistake! And now you know better.
 
Every time you go out on your boat, you need to check your safety gear to 
make sure it’s in good, working condition. Follow these recommendations and 
check out Figure 12-1:
 
✓ Before each trip, make sure your communication devices (cellphone 
and/or VHF radio) are charged and working properly.
 
✓ Check your fire extinguisher to make sure the charge gauge indicates it’s 
ready for action.
 
✓ Check that the anchor, rode (the anchor rope), and shackles that hold 
the rode to the anchor are secure and the rope isn’t frayed.
 
✓ Even if you don’t expect your crew to wear life preservers, hand one to 
each person so he or she can make sure it fits before leaving the dock.
 
Federal law requires children under the age of 14 to wear life jackets at all 
times while boating. This law applies in all states unless the state has its own 
minimum age requirement for life jacket wear. In boating, state laws take prior-
ity over federal law, so make sure you check the rules where you boat.

Stowing a first-aid kit
A first-aid kit can’t carry everything needed for an appendectomy or a heart 
attack, but you should at the least stock the same type of basic medical sup-
plies you have at home in your medicine cabinet.
While the potential always exists for a serious medical emergency to arise 
when you’re boating, 99 percent of what you’ll run into on your boat will be 
manageable if you keep handy all the basic supplies for relieving discomfort 
and injury. Here’s a list of gear I keep on the boat in my first-aid kit:
 
✓ Adhesive bandages
 
✓ Antibiotic ointment
 
✓ Antihistamine for bug bites or allergic reactions

214
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility
 
✓ Aspirin or other painkiller
 
✓ Bug repellent
 
✓ Cortisone cream for bug bites
 
✓ Elastic tape for binding wounds or sprains
 
✓ Medical tape
 
✓ Seasick remedies and antacid
 
✓ Sterile gauze pads in several sizes
 
✓ Sterile rolled gauze
 
✓ Sunscreen
Before you go boating, grab your first-aid kit — and check its contents — so 
you’ll be ready for what ails you.
Bringing communication gear
You should have the equipment needed to call the United States Coast Guard 
or other local rescue operators. This equipment may include a VHF radio in 
some places, but on many smaller inland waters, a cellphone for a call to 911 
is sometimes better. Ask your local boating acquaintances which they use 
and suggest. Or do like most boaters and take both. I discuss how to properly 
call for help on the water using whatever communication device you choose 
in the section, “Calling for the Help You Need,” later in this chapter.
 
If you’re going into more remote areas without communication, you’re depen-
dent on your boat and motor for a safe return. Even though you can often 
count on friendly boaters for a rescue should your boat fail, you also should 
be prepared to go it alone.
Reaching out with a VHF radio
VHF radios are special radios operating on bands reserved for marine com-
munications. Before the cellphone, many boaters inland and offshore used 
VHF radios daily, and you could walk the docks of any marina and hear radio 
chatter. Today, the proliferation of cellphones makes that experience rare.
So why buy a VHF radio if you think nobody’s listening? Because when trou-
ble comes, the rescuers will have one and will be able to talk to you — and 
they won’t need to know your phone number to call you. Even though they 
may not easily see you because your boat’s just a small speck in the sea or 
other large body of water, you’ll be able to see their chopper or rescue craft 
and talk them in with signals to turn right or left or north or south.

215
 Chapter 12: Preparing for and Handling Boating Emergencies
 
A waterproof, handheld VHF radio can be your best safety device. With it, you 
can continue to transmit mayday calls even if you’re in the water. When you 
see rescue boats or aircraft, you can hail them on the radio — they’ll be listen-
ing, trust me. In fact, handheld VHF radios are in retailer West Marine’s list of 
top ten popular gift items. I think keeping one in the boat is essential to peace 
of mind and safety.
Calling on your cellphone
Cellphones were once looked down upon as a primary communication device 
for boaters. But in areas where there’s adequate coverage, more boaters rely 
on them than on VHF radios. If your cellphone works in an area, you can rely 
on 411 for information and often 911 for emergency response. However, not 
all response centers can get a position from your cellphone, so a GPS or a 
chart is necessary to give rescuers your position.
 
I don’t have to tell you that being stranded along a highway with no way to call 
a tow truck or ambulance is frustrating, if not scary. You bought a cellphone 
for that very reason, right? Well, your cellphone may not work on the lake, just 
like it may not work along a remote section of highway. And it sure won’t work 
more than a few miles offshore on the ocean. If your cellphone gets wet, it may 
not work, either. So take care to keep it dry.
Taking navigation tools
The second most frequent cause for initiating search and rescue missions 
(boats dead in the water is the first) is grounding, according to a report by 
the U.S. Coast Guard. Accidents because of faulty navigation tactics are the 
easiest safety failure to correct. It’s easier to navigate safely today than ever 
before because the entire world has been mapped and remapped. All that 
information is available on charts and Global Positioning Systems (GPS). A 
combination of charts and a GPS device makes boating safer. And don’t forget 
your trusty compass when the batteries in your GPS go dead. See Chapter 10 
for more details on navigation equipment.
Finding your way with GPS
Getting lost leads to running out of gas or running aground. Both strand you 
at inconvenient, often dangerous times and places. A GPS device is the ideal 
solution for keeping trouble at bay. You can buy a handheld version com-
plete with basic maps for as little as $100.
For boating in unfamiliar waters — all waters are unfamiliar for new boaters — 
the better the GPS device you can afford, the more likely it is to save you 
from trouble of both the mechanical and life-threatening sorts. In fact, I 

216
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility
heard that one propeller repair shop manager, who worked on the Georgian 
Bay of Lake Huron, said that the GPS equipment that boaters are using is so 
accurate it’s killing his repair business. They simply aren’t running into the 
rocks as much. Seeing as the Coast Guard reports the number-one cause for 
initiating search and rescue missions is for boats dead in the water, saving a 
propeller could be saving a life.
 
Don’t think of a GPS as a handy substitute for a paper chart and strong local 
knowledge. Every GPS I’ve seen has a disclaimer on the power-up screen 
saying, “Don’t rely on this device as your sole source of navigation informa-
tion.” I’ve been on the water many times when GPS has failed.
 
Even if you’re boating with a GPS guide, look behind you frequently as you 
meander along. On your return trip, the landmarks will be familiar.
Following a chart with the help of a compass
Even if you spring for a GPS, don’t go boating without a chart and a compass 
as well. Keep the chart folded open to the area you’re in, and note your prog-
ress along the way, penciling in landmarks you see. I’ve had to come home 
on a compass when my GPS failed, as mechanical things are bound to do, and 
my notes and marked landmarks ensured me that I was on the right path.
You may think talk of charts and GPS units is goofy when you’re planning to 
boat on a lake in which you can see the entire shoreline from any one spot. 
But most waters have hidden hazards revealed only in a chart. You may 
never need to rely on a compass on a 500-acre lake, but you should get in the 
habit of doing so anyway. Soon, you’ll want to adventure in other waters that 
may not be so tame.
Filing a float plan and checking insurance
The best way to make sure you’ll be missed if you become stranded is to 
tell people when and where you’re going and when you will be back! A float 
plan is the boater’s version of the flight plan that pilots file to indicate their 
departure times and locations, their destinations, and their estimated landing 
times. They do this so that if something goes wrong and they don’t show up, 
people have an idea of where to begin a search.
You can call reliable friends or relatives and give them your float plan, but 
keep in mind that they may all get it confused when trying to remember it 
later. It’s better to write your float plan on paper and give it to two or three 
friends or relatives, or send them an e-mail with the information. Make sure 
they receive it by following up with a phone call. Tell them you’ll contact 
them when you return. That way if you don’t, they can call the rescue

 Chapter 12: Preparing for and Handling Boating Emergencies
 
Double-check your boat insurance and make sure you have enough towing 
insurance to get you back from the farthest point at which you may break 
down. In ocean situations, a tow boat has to find you, hitch up, and pull you 
back. That can take hours and even a few thousand dollars. Make sure you’re 
covered so you can easily secure the help you need.
Tackling Types of Emergencies
When an emergency arises, it helps to remain calm. And it’s easier to remain 
calm when you know the right steps to take to deal with the emergency. In 
this section, I walk you through some of the most common categories of 
calamities you may encounter while boating and offer tips on how to manage 
your boat and your crew in case of equipment breakdowns, fire, groundings, 
and more.
 
By the way, during an emergency, if you have other capable people onboard, 
assign them tasks such as gathering kids together, double-checking life jacket 
buckles and adjustments, and, if you have to abandon ship, getting supplies 
together that you’ll need while adrift. In fact, these are great tasks to assign 
before you leave the dock or boat ramp. That way you minimize the confusion 
in communication in the event of an emergency.
 
Communication is the key to keeping your crew calm and helpful. If some crew 
members don’t seem to be functioning well, assign other crew members to 
keep them on the right track. Nothing stokes the flame of panic like a vacuum 
of information.
Equipment failure
So often boaters head out of port for one reason: to get away from every-
thing, including other people. Whether you’re boating alone or with a crew, 
you have to be prepared to handle emergencies. On a small Northwoods 
Wisconsin lake, it’s not so hard to get help by just waving your arms. But 
if you’re miles up a desert lake in Utah or far out to sea when things break 
down, you may be hours from rescue.
 
If you have room on your boat, take along spare parts that commonly fail, like 
an extra propeller, hose clamps, and wooden pegs or wax seals to repair leaks 
should they occur. In Chapter 20, I explain in detail what a good mariner car-
ries in order to handle tight spots caused by equipment failure or leaks.

Fire
Boat fires are usually a result of a mechanical malfunction, although it’s pos-
sible for a collision to result in one, too. Most fires start in the bilge around 
the engine where fuel vapors and electrical components create the perfect 
storm for fire: volatile fumes, heat, and an electric spark. If they ignite and 
you can’t put it out quickly, fire becomes pretty hard to stop because the 
resins that give fiberglass its strength and shape are flammable.
If your boat’s on fire, here are the basic steps to take:
 
1. Double-check that all crew members are wearing life jackets, and give 
the handheld VHF radio to an adult.
 
2. Get people off the boat and away from it as quickly as possible. Use a 
lifeboat if you have one handy; otherwise, they should jump into the 
water wearing their life jackets.
 
3. Extend a long line from the boat and have the crew swim to the end of 
it and hang on for as long as the boat floats or until you put the 
fire out.
 
 It will be much easier for the Coasties to find everyone near the burn-
ing boat. Make sure everyone can easily let the rope go if the boat goes 
down — you don’t want to go with it!
 
4. With everyone off the boat, and only if you feel confident that you can 
safely do so, try to put out the fire with fire extinguishers.
 
 Many experts believe if you can’t put a fire out in 10 seconds, you need 
to get off the boat in less than 60 seconds. That’s why some captains’ 
first response to a fire is to get passengers off the boat.
 
 If you suspect fire in the engine compartment, don’t open it to check. 
Opening the hatch could let in oxygen and stoke a small fire in the 
closed compartment into a big one.
 
 Many boats have a see-through fire port — a clear silicone peep hole — 
on the engine compartment. You can see if fire is inside, and if it is, you 
can puncture this port in order to poke the nozzle of a fire extinguisher 
in and douse the flames. If you don’t have a fire port, they’re easy and 
inexpensive to install. Other boats have built-in extinguisher systems 
that let you deploy them without lifting the engine compartment hatch. 
Automatic fire extinguishers usually are installed by the boat factory 
and are reserved for larger boats. However, European safety standards 
commonly require them in boats once thought too small, so it’s now not 
surprising to find automatic fire extinguishers in boats as small as 20 
feet long.

219
 Chapter 12: Preparing for and Handling Boating Emergencies
 
5. If you can’t put out the blaze, or if the boat is already sinking, join 
your crew in the water. Or, if you’re sure the fire’s out, bring the crew 
back onboard to await assistance or limp to port.
My good boating buddy Ted Lund comes from Key West. He told me of a trip 
on his dad’s charter boat when it caught fire. His father’s first command in 
responding to the fire? “Get off the boat, son. Jump in the water.” Which Ted 
did, immediately. They put the fire out, but the boat could have exploded.
Truthfully, I hate even bringing up fire in a boat. I’ve never seen it happen, 
but I know more than one person who has experienced it. Those boats were 
all much older boats and probably didn’t have the superior safety building 
techniques now required to achieve the coveted NMMA (National Marine 
Manufacturers Association) certification. Boats with that certification are 
always built to a high standard of reliability and safety.
Grounding on hazards below the surface
Grounding is essentially a collision with the ground or other object beneath 
the water’s surface, such as a sandbar, large rock, or even a large tree stump. 
Some groundings are gentle and the boat simply grinds to a halt. But they can 
be abrupt, too, knocking people around in the boat more like a collision. The 
point is that a grounding brings your boat to a halt. Sometimes, you contact 
the ground, pass over the shallow spot, and find your boat disabled but float-
ing on the other side.
Here are some steps to follow in the case of a grounding:
 
1. Make sure your whole crew is safe. Address any injuries or, if you 
have a capable crew member, assign someone else to handle injuries 
while you check out the boat and your situation.
 
2. Make sure the boat’s situation is as stable as it can be.
 
• If you’re grounded, stay that way and check for leaks. Don’t 
unground the boat until you’re certain it doesn’t leak. Chances are 
if it does leak, you can’t fix it and you need to wait for help.
 
• If you’re afloat or adrift in a current without engine power, drop 
an anchor. Your collision with the ground could leave you floating, 
but your propeller or engine could be damaged and unserviceable.
 
• If you have power and you’re leaking, get to shore as quickly as 
possible.
 
3. Assess your need for help. If you need help, use whatever tools you 
have (VHF radio, cellphone, flares, or waving rags) to summon it and 
sit tight. Otherwise, do what you need to do to ensure you’re seaworthy 
(there are no leaks, you have engine power, and you can control the 
boat) and head in to port.

220
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility
Note: When you’re safely back on shore, you may need to notify the local 
authorities of your grounding accident. Most states have a damage threshold 
amount that must be exceeded before reporting is necessary. In the case 
of injuries, reporting is always required. Even if your boat isn’t damaged, in 
environmentally sensitive places like the Florida Keys, damage to the bottom 
of the water body must be reported and mitigated by your insurance.
Collision with another vessel
The considerations to keep in mind and act on when you have a collision 
with another vessel are basically the same as those for a grounding (refer 
to the preceding section). The crucial difference is that, with a collision, 
another boat and another crew are involved. The circumstances bring special 
responsibilities such as the following:
 
✓ No matter who is at fault, see that all passengers in both boats are as 
safe as you can make them.
 
✓ Call rescue help if needed.
 
✓ Call state, municipal, or federal water patrol authorities on a VHF 
radio or cellphone (usually such a call is required by law). Follow their 
directions.
 
✓ If damage is minor, both boats are still seaworthy, no injuries are 
involved, and you have been cleared by the authorities to leave the 
scene, then exchange the same kind of information you would if you 
were involved in a fender bender, including names, driver’s license num-
bers, insurance info, phone numbers, and hull registrations. You may 
find you need to be in touch later.
Distracting the captain never ends well
Most U.S. Coast Guard accident postmortems 
indicate that serious and sometimes fatal acci-
dents are often the culmination of a series of 
events that began with one innocuous and 
seemingly unrelated event.
For example, a boat passenger gets his finger 
pinched in a hatch. The captain leaves the helm 
to help him, forgetting that the motor is idling 
in gear. While their heads are down as they 
try to open the finger-jamming hatch, the boat 
meanders into a roped-off swimming area and a 
swimmer is injured by the boat’s propeller.
Distractions in a boat are common. The best 
way to avoid them is for the captain to remem-
ber that, while the boat is running, his responsi-
bility is to control it. Even when the boat is adrift 
and not under power, it’s the captain’s job to 
keep it safe by signaling others, dropping an 
anchor, or even paddling the boat safely into 
port.

221
 Chapter 12: Preparing for and Handling Boating Emergencies
Weather
Sudden violent weather can sneak up on you when boating, and sometimes 
you don’t have time to get to port safely before it arises. I’ve seen even 
smaller lakes whipped up into dangerous whitecaps by squalls; the worst 
thing boaters can do when that happens is to try to run like the wind to get 
home. Better to hunker down low in the boat and travel to the nearest shelter 
to sit things out. Duck into a cove or a nearby marina to wait. Even tucking in 
around the downwind side of a point or bend in a river can offer more safety 
and protection than the open water. I explain in detail the tricks for handling 
bad weather in Chapter 11.
Personal accident or injury
The trick to good first aid is found in the Hippocratic Oath: “Do no harm.” If 
you don’t know what to do, it’s better to do nothing unless the threat to life 
is immediate. An overheated crewmember needs to be cooled and his or her 
thirst quenched. You need to know the signs of heat stroke (nausea, vomit-
ing, fatigue, dizziness) so you can help him or her before thirst and heat 
become a problem. Arterial bleeding has to be stopped or slowed by apply-
ing pressure, or medical attention may unfortunately not be needed later. But 
is removing a fish hook really something you should try to do?
 
Check with your boating guests in advance to make sure they bring along 
any time-sensitive medications they need. Asthmatics should have inhalers 
or other meds, and diabetics should have at least one extra insulin injection 
onboard along with plenty of appropriate food for the outing. When you’re 
boating with new guests who may be a little sensitive to outdoor risks, keep 
the outing simple and close to home — at least until you know they’re up for 
more adventure.
Calling for the Help You Need
You’ve seen those movies where people drift around in lifeboats, delirious 
and drinking ocean water and trying to eat seagulls, right? Well, that’s not 
where you’re going with your boat. At least, not if you read this chapter. 
Sure, I know more than a couple of boaters who had to spend the night out in 
their boats, but in your power boat you’re probably not going into the end-
less sea lanes of the South Pacific.

222
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility
There’s no guarantee that you won’t need assistance, though. If you boat long 
enough, it’s almost a statistical certainty that eventually you’ll at least need a 
tow in.
The two types of calls for help you want to be familiar with when you’re boat-
ing are
 
✓ Mayday: The international call for distress when the boat or someone’s 
life is in immediate danger
 
✓ Pan-pan: An urgent call for help when the boat or a human life is not 
immediately threatened
 
Unless immediate assistance is mandatory to save the boat or save lives, 
never use mayday.
 
Whether you’ve made a boating mistake or not, don’t be too embarrassed to 
ask for help. And don’t worry about being slapped around verbally for goof-
ing up with the wrong call. I’ve never seen anyone more gracious than marine 
rescue personnel.
Making a mayday call
Mayday calls on a VHF radio can only work wherever other boaters and 
water safety enforcement personnel monitor the VHF band. The U.S. Coast 
Guard seldom monitors VHF signals far from waters navigated by commercial 
boats. In most inland waters, local or state law enforcement personnel are 
your go-to guys in an emergency.
 
In port, inquire about who handles emergencies on the boating waters and 
determine how to communicate with them. If VHF radio is used in your area, 
follow the steps in this section for making a mayday call. If emergencies are 
handled through a 911 dispatcher, you make that call with your cellphone, just 
like you would at home.
Follow these steps to call a mayday on the VHF radio:
 
1. Turn the VHF radio to channel 16.
 
 That’s the channel the Coasties monitor — and the channel most other 
boaters monitor, too.
 
2. Press the transmit button and say “mayday” three times.
 
 Be calm when you say it, even if you don’t feel that way. And don’t yell 
into the microphone; it tends to make your transmission unintelligible.

223
 Chapter 12: Preparing for and Handling Boating Emergencies
 
3. Clearly state who you are.
 
• If your boat has a name, say it. For example, if your boat were 
named Unfortunate, you would say, “Mayday, mayday, mayday! 
This is Unfortunate, this is Unfortunate.”
 
• If your boat doesn’t have a name, say something descriptive like, 
“This is little white Sea Ray.” (Sea Ray is a brand of boat.) This 
information can help rescuers spot you when they approach.
 
4. Give your location.
 
• If you have a GPS, give your latitude and longitude — it really 
makes things easier. (If you don’t have a GPS for your first mishap, 
I’ll bet you’ll be shopping for one soon.)
 
• If you don’t know your location, give the closest thing you know. 
For example, you may say, “We passed under the big green bridge 
about ten minutes ago” or “We left Neophyte Harbor headed north-
west two hours ago.” Anything like that will help narrow down the 
search area. If you have a chart with you, refer to it to give better 
landmarks.
 
5. If you don’t hear a response, don’t give up. Keep trying.
 
6. When you get a response or even if you don’t get a response, give 
your position and the nature of your emergency.
 
 Tell the Coasties in as few words as possible why you’re in danger. Just 
because you can’t hear a response doesn’t mean someone isn’t listening 
to you.
Making a pan-pan call
“Pan-pan” is what you say when you need help but your situation isn’t life-
threatening. If you need pan-pan–level help, use the same procedures as for 
a mayday call except substitute the word “pan-pan” for “mayday”: “Pan-pan, 
pan-pan, pan-pan!” That tells rescuers that you won’t get home without help, 
but the situation is stable and your passengers are safe.
For example, you would make a pan-pan call if
 
✓ You’re aground on a sandbar.
 
✓ You’re out of gas.
 
✓ You’re broken down.
 
✓ You’re lost.
 
✓ There’s thunder and lightning all around you.

224
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility
However, one of these situations could turn into something mayday-worthy if 
the delay in your return to port could cause injury. For instance, if you have a 
diabetic onboard who’s about to go into insulin shock, then your mishap that 
led to an inconvenience has resulted in a mayday.
 
Remember, it’s up to the boat captain to decide whether it’s a mayday or not. 
It’s unlikely you’ll be criticized for erring on the side of caution. But, generally 
speaking, I wouldn’t want to tell a rescue swimmer that he jumped out of a 
helicopter just because you were going to miss a plane to Phoenix if you didn’t 
get home by 7 p.m.!
Sometimes you’ll just pull a boneheaded move (don’t take offense; I’ve done 
it myself, I freely admit) and run out of gas or jam up on a sandbar or — well, 
you get the picture. If one of these things happens and you’re inconvenienced 
but not endangered, there are at least three nationwide boat-towing services 
that will bring you fuel or tow you in. Good boat insurance will cover the 
expense (find out more about insuring your boat in Chapter 3). Look into the 
three top national marine towing services by visiting these Web sites:
 
✓ seatow.com
 
✓ www.vesselassist.com
 
✓ www.boatus.com
Other means of getting attention
Three kinds of help are available to you out on the water: official help, pri-
vate enterprise help, and Good Samaritan help. On inland waterways, you’re 
most likely to get a Good Samaritan. If your life or that of your crew is in peril, 
the U.S. Coast Guard or other state or local rescue or enforcement agencies 
will be there to help you.
Here are a few ways to get the attention of a Good Samaritan:
 
✓ Flares: In many waters, three safety flares are required safety equipment 
onboard. Don’t fire them unless you believe someone is in visible range. 
Various kinds of flares are available at marine stores, and each has spe-
cific and simple directions for usage.
 
✓ Waving a rag or flag: It’s true, flying Old Glory upside down is a distress 
call. But you also can wave a rag or a paddle or anything to get a Good 
Samaritan’s attention.
 
✓ Empty-handed wave: If you don’t even have a shirt on your back, wave 
your hands from side to side, crossing them overhead. Do it repeatedly 
until the Good Samaritan notices.

225
 Chapter 12: Preparing for and Handling Boating Emergencies
 
If you see a boater giving a distress signal, you absolutely have an obligation 
to offer assistance. If you’re aware of a life-threatening situation on the water 
and fail to act to save a life, you can be culpable in the loss of life. At the very 
least, you should stand by and raise help on a radio or cellphone.
Deciding whether to wait 
for help or head for shore
Waiting for help in an emergency isn’t easy. Even on land, rushing to the 
emergency room or waiting for an ambulance can be a tough judgment call. 
When boating, here are a few instances when waiting is either necessary or at 
least a better choice:
 
✓ Your motor doesn’t work (you aren’t going anywhere anyway).
 
✓ Moving an injured patient is too painful or otherwise dangerous.
 
✓ The rescue authorities have asked you to wait for assistance.
Sometimes waiting for help isn’t feasible, though, such as when you’re not 
sure help is coming. Here are two instances when moving toward shore and 
help is preferable, if you’re able to:
 
✓ You have no indication that anyone heard your call for help.
 
✓ Any injured parties are stable and able to handle the motion of the boat.
 
Don’t feel compelled to take action merely to expend nervous energy. If help is 
on the way, it’s best to wait for it. Heck, the Coasties may be planning to give 
your friend in need a chopper ride. You wouldn’t want to cheat him or her out 
of that, would you?
Deciding to Abandon Ship
“Abandon ship!” You’ve heard the words used jokingly a million times. But as 
a boat owner, now you have to think about what those words really mean. If 
you have an emergency on your hands, will it require you to leave your boat? 
If so, your main objective is to make sure your crew is calm and prepared 
with life jackets on.
Emergencies like a small boat overturning in high seas or winds or a ground-
ing that fractures the hull and swamps it are extreme cases when life jack-
ets are all that stand between you and drowning. That’s why keeping them 
handy, if not wearing them, at all times is so important.

226
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility
 
In all cases but fire onboard, staying with the boat — even if it’s swamped — is 
the best rescue scenario. If the boat is overturned, staying in it isn’t possible, 
but staying near it is the best and safest course. It’s easier for rescuers to find 
the overturned boat than bobbing heads in the water. If your boat is under 
23 feet long and is certified by the NMMA, it’s designed not to sink even when 
fully flooded, giving your crew a safe place to await help. Some boats over 23 
feet are also built not to sink, and that’s a reassuring advantage.
As captain, you need to understand how to handle emergency circumstances 
and help your crew deal with the situation. Keep these steps in mind when 
you decide to abandon ship because of a sinking ship:
 
1. If the boat is sinking, help everyone stay calm. Stay with the boat until 
it’s obvious it’s going under.
 
2. Forgive me for saying this again, but make sure everyone’s wearing a 
life jacket.
 
3. Make sure those assigned to grab emergency supplies (VHF radio, 
water, flares, and food) do so.
 
4. Jump into the water, and stay together. If the water is cold, you can 
minimize cooling by huddling together, which also assists everyone in 
staying afloat.
 
In cold water below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, you only have a few seconds or 
a minute or two (depending on the temperature) before cold water causes 
shock that robs you of your ability to coordinate your motions to stay afloat. If 
you can’t at least rely on a life jacket in that time, your chances of survival are 
poor at best. That’s why I always wear a life jacket and make my crew do the 
same when boating in cold water.
 
Ocean or Great Lakes boaters in particular are wise to keep a small inflatable 
lifeboat onboard. Stow it forward, as far away from the engine as possible. 
When it’s apparent that abandoning ship is imminent, deploy the lifeboat by 
following the instructions on the bag (which you should have read and famil-
iarized yourself with earlier).
Attempting Temporary Repairs
If you’ve had an accident that isn’t serious, there are no serious injuries, and 
you have the know-how and tools, you can attempt temporary repairs that 
will allow you to get safely back to port. In this section, I cover some tips and 
tactics for assessing damage and repairing or recovering your craft so you 
can either get back to boating or at least get back to shore. Keep yourself 
and your crew calm, and you can often keep an accident from being anything 
more than an inconvenience.

227
 Chapter 12: Preparing for and Handling Boating Emergencies
Assessing the damage
When an accident occurs, you need to look around yourself, look to your 
crew’s safety and mental state, and try to maintain the integrity of the boat 
and crew.
For a normal outing in a runabout, it’s not likely you’ll have special tools or 
materials handy to permanently patch a hole, but if your boat is properly 
equipped to the letter of the law, you should have the tools to put out a fire, 
and you may also have plenty of resources onboard to stop it from taking on 
water.
Fixing what you can
When you’ve settled the safety and security of your crew, made contact with 
local rescue authorities, and identified the damage to the boat, it’s time to 
play MacGyver and whip out your Swiss Army knife to get things patched up. 
Here are some things you can try:
 
✓ Plug leaks. Improvise if you have to, but try to stop the water. Rags, 
plastic bags — heck, sometimes even chewing gum — can get you back 
to the dock. Stuffing towels or garbage bags in the hole can slow the 
flow.
 
 Through-hull fittings are a common point for taking on water. They can 
break off or corrode, allowing water in the hull. Keep tapered wooden 
pegs onboard to drive into these openings, or fill them with wax from a 
plumber’s wax ring (Chapter 20 discusses your options for materials to 
plug leaks).
 
✓ If your propeller is broken and you carry a spare, try to get the boat in 
a safe position to change the propeller and get underway again. Spare 
propellers are a great safety item to carry if you have room. Find out 
more about changing propellers in Chapter 15.
Boating is about as safe a sport as exists, but when you turn on the local 
news at the end of a holiday weekend, you often hear about a boating acci-
dent. To a non-boater, it can look like a bunch of self-destructive idiots are 
out there on the water every weekend. Yet, for the number of boats regis-
tered each year — over 12 million — the number of accidents is low, and the 
sport is likely safer than snow skiing, motorcycle riding, or bicycling.
Still, if you play the game long enough, accidents will happen. Not necessar-
ily fatal ones, but problematic ones. Personally, I’ve been run into by another 
boat, and I once crunched a concrete pier hard enough to damage the boat. It 
happens.

228
Part III: With Much Boating Fun Comes Much Responsibility
Minor equipment failure can 
have major consequences
Malfunctioning equipment is a safety con-
cern, no matter how unrelated to safety or 
how inconsequential it may seem. You may not 
plan to be out after dark, so knowing that your 
navigation lights don’t work may not bother you. 
But a breakdown that leaves you stranded on 
a busy waterway after dark can make you a 
serious hazard to other boaters, not to mention 
yourself.
Make sure your boat is shipshape. Everything 
on a boat needs to be in place and functioning. 
You never know what minor equipment failure 
could tip the first domino that leads to an acci-
dent. Here are two examples of real accidents 
and their surprising causes:
 ✓ The case of the missing spare anchor: Bill 
and his boys were returning from bottom-
fishing far offshore. They snagged their only 
anchor and had to leave it on the bottom. 
Returning to their harbor was always dicey 
for them because currents were fast and 
the inlet choppy. They’d been in calm seas 
all day, and none of them were wearing 
life jackets when they reached the choppy 
inlet.
 
 The motor conked out. Ordinarily, Bill would 
simply have had one of his boys deploy the 
anchor while he sorted out the engine 
problem. But their anchor was lost and 
they didn’t have a spare. The current swept 
them into an outlying jetty and capsized 
their boat. Fighting the current, Bill and his 
boys barely made it to safety — and they 
lost their boat and gear.
 
 An anchor is considered safety gear 
because it lets you control the boat when 
the power fails. Bottom-fishing is a common 
way to lose an anchor, and Bill should have 
had a spare onboard for such a case. Or, 
knowing they didn’t have one, Bill and his 
crew should have returned to harbor earlier 
to hit the inlet at slack tide when it was less 
treacherous.
 ✓ The case of the loose ladder fitting: The 
Andersons and Wilsons decided to drop 
anchor and enjoy a sunny day from a quiet 
cove. They spent all afternoon paddling 
around the cove, drinking refreshments, 
and playing cards. Half the crew was still 
swimming and the other half were onboard 
when they decided to return to the dock.
 
 Just as Mr. Anderson began to hoist the 
anchor, the boarding ladder broke and the 
swimmers couldn’t get back on the boat. 
Mr. Anderson had the anchor halfway in 
and lashed it down to a deck cleat so he 
could assist the swimmers. He’d been 
planning to fix that loose ladder fitting for 
months.
 
 With all crew safely onboard, he put the 
throttle down and got up on plane when 
suddenly the anchor, still dangling from 
the deck cleat, reached the end of its rope 
and sling-shotted into the boat, injuring the 
Wilsons.
 
 A boarding ladder is a key piece of safety 
gear that enables passengers who fall or 
jump overboard to return to the boat. The 
Andersons saw it mainly as a swimming 
convenience and so weren’t too concerned 
about the loose fitting. Even a loose hinge 
breaking at an inopportune time could have 
distracted Mr. Anderson from securing the 
rogue anchor that caused the injury.

Keeping Your Boat

here’s more to boating than just leaning over the helm 
with a heroic look on your face while the wind toys 
with your hair. Sometimes you have to roll up your 
sleeves and get busy making the boat shipshape. In this 
part, I explain what kind of service work generally needs 
to be done on your boat and when it needs to be done. If 
you’re a do-it-yourself kind of boater, I give some specific 
tips to help you decide if you should get a service manual 
and tackle boat maintenance yourself, and I walk you 
through the steps of some maintenance procedures.

B
oating isn’t free, but it’s not the most expensive family pastime you can 
enjoy, by far. If you compare it to a day at a theme park or a weekly 
round of golf, it’s usually cheaper fun. To tilt the scale even further in the 
direction of value, many boaters learn to handle some of the most basic boat 
maintenance themselves. Yet, more than the dollar savings, many boaters 
weigh the time savings of hauling their boat to the shop and waiting for the 
mechanic to get to it. Sometimes the work needed is simple and fast enough 
that the mechanic concludes in a day or so. Other times, there’s no way to 
explain why it takes the mechanic so long.
This chapter can’t take the place of a step-by-step engine service manual or 
your particular engine’s owner’s manual, but it does give you a job list of 
tasks that need to be done and lets you know how uncomplicated the work 
is. If you store your boat on a trailer or in a marina that will let you service 
your own boat, I hope you’ll dig into this chapter and be motivated to get a 
little grease on your hands and keep a little more green in your pocket.
In this chapter, I break down the service work that various engine types 
require and explain the basic processes involved in performing the work. I 
list the tools you need to do the work, including handy gadgets to ease the 
work. And I give you cost comparisons between servicing your boat and 
servicing your automobile, so you have a standard by which to compare the 
payback for doing it yourself.

Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
Checking and Changing 
Your Engine’s Oil
I was shocked when a friend told me that a mechanic charges nearly four 
times the cost of an automobile oil change to change her boat’s engine oil. 
It’s remarkable, especially when you consider that the oil, filter, and other 
supplies usually cost the same for a boat as for an automobile and the work 
is no different.
This section walks you through the general steps of changing your engine’s 
oil. If you’ve ever changed the oil in your car, you’ll catch on to the process 
immediately. If you’ve ever checked your car’s engine oil, it won’t be hard to 
apply this information to the marine engine in your boat. If you’re a take-it-to-
the-shop sort of person, that’s okay — at least you’ll know what your recre-
ational time is worth.
 
Your engine owner’s manual tells you how frequently the oil should be 
changed. That frequency is based on hours of operation, instead of miles 
driven, as you’re used to with your car. The hours of operation interval can be 
different for every engine and therefore is something you should consult your 
owner’s manual to determine. And, just like when your car manual says to 
change the oil once per year or every 5,000 miles, your boat’s engine manual 
says “change the oil once a year or every X hours of operation.” If you use 
your boat a lot, you may need more than one oil change per year. And as I say 
in Chapter 14, you should change the oil before you put it in long-term storage 
for the winter.
Lubing up four-stroke outboards
Like your automobile engine, four-stroke outboard engines have an oil reser-
voir and an oil pump that lifts oil from the reservoir and distributes it around 
the engine to lubricate the moving parts so they don’t destroy themselves 
with friction. Over time, heat and friction degrade the oil, and some of it is 
lost as it seeps into the engine’s combustion chamber and gets burned along 
with the fuel. In some cases, fuel slips into the oil reservoir, diluting the oil 
and also degrading its ability to protect the engine from abrasion.
Although the individual steps remain the same from boat to boat, the loca-
tions of the dipstick, oil filter, and reservoir drain plug are different on each 
engine. The following sections detail what tools and supplies you need and 
how to perform the work on four-stroke outboards.

233
 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
Tools and supplies
The tools list for changing your oil is simple and not very expensive. You 
need the following:
 
✓ An oil filter wrench to remove and replace the oil filter. This tool is 
available at any auto parts store.
 
✓ A 12-inch adjustable wrench to remove the reservoir drain plug. Avoid 
the shorter 8-inch wrench, which may not provide enough leverage to 
unscrew a tight drain plug.
 
✓ A container, bucket, or jug to capture the old oil as it drains.
 
✓ A long-necked funnel to pour new oil into the engine without spilling it.
 
✓ An ample supply of rags to make cleanup easy and to help prevent 
spills.
Not just any engine oil will meet the standards approved by all boat engine 
makers. Your engine owner’s manual may specify a certain brand and grade 
of oil, but competing brands or formulas may be perfectly acceptable as well. 
Oils are formulated and graded for their ability to do the job of lubricating 
under certain conditions. (For a deeper understanding of oil formulations, 
I discuss formulas in the sidebar “Premium or bargain oil: Does it matter?”) 
Here are some additional things to know about the oil you use:
 
✓ FC-W: This is the standard of oil required to sustain your engine’s opera-
tion and warranty if you change the oil at the recommended intervals and 
maintain it at the levels prescribed in your engine owner’s manual. The 
FC-W code appears on the engine oil label if it meets that requirement.
 
✓ Quantity: Your owner’s manual specifies how much oil should be added 
in quarts or liters. Most oil marketed in the United States is bottled 
in quarts or gallons, and your engine manual specifies quarts, so you 
should naturally follow the quart measurements when adding oil.
 
✓ Oil weight or grade: Oil is graded in weights, such as 30W (W is for 
weight). In addition to watching for the FC-W logo, you also should 
select the grade of oil specified in your engine owner’s manual.
 
✓ Brand: Some misinformed mechanics will tell you that your engine 
warranty is voided if you don’t use the same brand of oil as the brand 
of your engine. That’s patently false. Not one engine maker I know of 
requires that their brand of oil be used.
Oil filters remove bits of metal worn from the engine during normal use and 
also filter out sludge and other contaminants that reduce the oil’s ability to 
protect the engine from friction and heat. You should change the oil filter 
every time you change the oil. The two types of oil filters available for four-
stroke outboards are

234
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
 
✓ Automotive engine oil filters: Some four-stroke outboards are actually 
built with engines also used for automobiles. As a result, often automo-
bile filters fit the outboards and can be used for substantial savings. 
Many Honda outboards, for instance, use the same filters used in Honda 
automobiles. Check with your marine mechanic or an auto parts store to 
scope out compatibility.
 
✓ Marine engine oil filters: Some four-stroke outboards use filters spe-
cifically designed only for them. Your marine dealer should tell you 
whether this is the case, but you can also find out from your owner’s 
manual.
Checking the oil
The locations of the dipstick used to measure the engine oil level, the reser-
voir drain plug, and the oil filter vary with all four-stroke outboard motors, 
but all such motors have them. If you can’t spot these parts easily (Hint: They 
usually have a bright yellow handle on them!), consult your owner’s manual.
You should check your engine’s oil level before you start the motor at the 
beginning of the day. Remove the dipstick and look near the end of it. Marks 
on the stick will indicate whether it’s full or you need to add oil. If the oil is 
down to the “Add oil” level on the dipstick, add some oil just like you would 
for your car, checking the level intermittently so as to be sure you don’t over-
fill it.
Changing the oil
Oil-changing procedures may be slightly different from boat to boat — and 
you may find one brand of outboard engine more or less convenient to work 
on than another — but the basic process of changing the oil is universal. Oil 
change frequency can vary from boat to boat, as well. You need to consult 
your engine operator’s manual for the exact oil change interval.
The best place to change the oil is with the boat on the trailer in your own 
driveway. However, with an extractor pump, which allows you to pump out 
the oil through the dipstick tube and into an attached container that’s drum-
tight, you can even do it in the water with no risk to the boat or environment. 
Here’s how to change your oil:
 
1. Gather the tools, oil, filter, and rags you need to change the oil.
 
2. Unlatch the latches on the engine cowl that covers the motor, and 
remove the engine cowl. Set it in a safe place where it won’t be 
damaged.

235
 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
 
3. Locate and remove the oil dipstick to open the reservoir from the top 
so that it doesn’t air lock and prevent the oil from draining.
 
4. Locate the engine drain plug and position the collection container 
under it to catch the used oil as it drains.
 
5. Remove the drain plug, and let the oil drain into the container until it 
stops flowing.
 
6. Locate the oil filter and unscrew it by hand or using a filter wrench.
 
 It looks like a beer can screwed to the engine. If you need a visual refer-
ence on a beer can, check the contents of your left hand — it is a week-
end, after all!
 
 Be careful when removing the filter; it contains oil, so hold it upright 
until you can empty it into your container for recycling.
 
7. Set the used filter aside for disposal.
 
 Some communities offer oil filter recycling programs; contact your city 
hall or consult a mechanic in your area about these programs. If no recy-
cling program exists, dispose of the filter and the oil as recommended 
by your community’s sanitation managers.
 
8. Replace the drain plug, and hand-tighten it, but don’t lean into it with 
your body. You don’t want to over-tighten it and risk stripping the 
threads.
 
9. Before installing the fresh oil filter, dip your finger into the old oil 
and rub a little of it around the rubber gasket on the top of the new 
oil filter to lubricate it so it seats firmly to the engine. Then screw on 
the filter.
 
10. Replace the oil dipstick.
 
11. Remove the oil cap on the top of the engine (it says “Oil fill” or some-
thing similar). Using the funnel, replace the engine oil in the quantity 
and grade specified by your owner’s manual.
 
12. Double-check to make sure there are no drips from the drain plug or 
filter. If there are, retighten things.
 
13. Using the dipstick, check the fresh oil to make sure you didn’t under-
fill or overfill.
 
 If the dipstick shows that you still need to add oil, that’s easy enough to 
do. If you accidentally add too much, you can use the extractor pump to 
remove it.
 
14. Replace the engine cowl, and latch it on.

236
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
Dealing with oil in two-stroke outboards
Two-stroke outboards don’t have an oil supply in the engine. Instead, they 
draw their lubricating oil from tanks located either in the cowl, as is the case 
with most outboards under 115 horsepower, or in the bilge (that’s boat-speak 
for bottom of the boat). When the engine is started, oil is drawn into it in a 
similar way as fuel. Some of the oil is diverted to the inner workings of the 
engine, and some is burned with the fuel.
 
You don’t change the oil in a two-stroke outboard, but you do have to add oil 
every time you add fuel.
If you don’t add oil, your two-stroke outboard engine usually detects the low 
levels and sounds a beeper, and at the same time shuts down the engine or 
limits its running speed automatically so you can limp home for oil without 
damaging your engine. If your engine fails to detect low oil levels (older 
engines don’t always have this safety mechanism) and continues running 
normally, excessive heat and friction will destroy your engine very quickly. 
So follow the procedure in this section every time you refuel your two-stroke 
outboard.
Tools and supplies
You don’t need any mechanical tools to add oil to your two-stroke outboard, 
but a funnel is handy to add oil without spilling. You also don’t need to 
change an oil filter because there isn’t one! The oil circulates through the 
engine only once and then is burned with the fuel, so it doesn’t get filtered.
Like four-stroke outboard oil, two-stroke outboard oil must meet certain stan-
dards to properly protect your motor. The industry minimum standard is set 
by the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) in cooperation 
with marine engine manufacturers. The standard is called TC-W3, and any oil 
you use should bear that code on the label.
Adding two-stroke oil
With a two-stroke outboard, you don’t need to change your oil — just fill up 
your oil reservoir every time you fuel up. It’s too easy not to do it yourself — 
the trick is remembering to do it.
If you have a 90-horsepower or smaller motor, locate your oil tank in the 
engine cowl. If it’s a larger motor, look in the bilge under the hatches in the 
sole (that’s boat-speak for the floor inside the boat). Remove the lid, insert a 
funnel, and pour in the oil. External tanks located in the bilge are translucent, 
so you can see how much you’re adding. Tanks in the cowl, however, need 
careful monitoring as you pour so you don’t overfill and spill.

237
 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
Changing inboard and 
sterndrive engine oil
Regardless of the brand of sterndrive or inboard engine you own, the engine 
was probably made by General Motors (GM) and burns gasoline. Very few 
sterndrives are made with diesel engines, and nearly all go to European mar-
kets where diesel fuel prices are subsidized by the government. These GM 
gasoline engines were first built for automobiles, and some will continue to 
be used in GM cars for many years. The process for changing the oil in them 
is exactly like the process of changing the oil in automobile engines.
Tools and supplies
If you change your car’s oil, you already have the tools you need for this job. 
All the tools necessary for changing four-stroke outboard oil that I cover in 
the earlier section, “Lubing up four-stroke outboards,” also work on inboard 
and sterndrive engines.
However, there’s one thing that makes changing inboard and sterndrive 
engine oil harder than changing automobile engine oil: Draining it out without 
spilling it in the bilge. It’s almost impossible to put a catch pan or container 
under the motor and then remove it without spilling the used oil when you’re 
done.
 
Most Mercruiser-brand motors built since 2005 have a clever drain tube on 
the engine that can be pulled through the bilge’s drain plug hole so the oil is 
drained directly into a container to be taken for recycling. I wish they all had 
that handy feature! If your engine isn’t equipped with the drain tube, I suggest 
you use an oil extractor pump made by Moeller Marine and available through 
marine stores like www.westmarine.com. The pump makes it extremely easy 
to pump out the oil through the dipstick tube. This extractor also serves as a 
used oil container that’s drum-tight, so you can transport it to a service sta-
tion to recycle the oil. This extractor costs about the same as an automobile 
oil change and can be used over and over, so it’s a must-buy if you’re going to 
service your own boat.
Gasoline-powered marine engines need 5 to 7 quarts of oil, depending on the 
size of the engine. Because they’re automotive engines, using filters and oil 
from an auto parts store is fine if you buy quality brands — and it may save 
you some cash over buying products made just for boat engines.
Consult your engine owner’s manual to determine what weight of oil you 
need to use. Both of the following common sterndrive brands have GM 
engines:

238
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
 
✓ Volvo Penta recommends 15W-50 engine oil.
 
✓ Mercruiser recommends 25W-40 engine oil.
Because marine engines are usually operated in warm and even hot weather, 
you should use heavier oils than you do in auto engines. In hot weather, even 
a cold inboard or sterndrive engine is at a higher temperature than a cold 
auto engine.
 
Your inboard or sterndrive engine is made by a car manufacturer and then 
marinized, or made ready for marine use, by the marine engine manufacturer. 
The oil filter fitting on your engine is often the same as one on a comparable 
car engine. Your engine manufacturer naturally recommends an oil filter of the 
same brand, and you can be assured it’s a good fit for your engine. However, 
you can buy an oil filter at an auto parts store if you prefer it to a marine shop, 
and if you buy a quality brand-name filter, you can rest easy that it will do the 
job quite well. Plus, you may save a little money.
Checking the oil
Checking your marine inboard or sterndrive engine’s oil is just like checking 
your car engine’s oil, which is logical given that most engines are made by 
GM. Here’s what you need to do:
 
1. Locate the dipstick (it should have a bright yellow handle with a ring 
in it to put your finger through), and pull it out.
 
2. Wipe off the stick with a rag and reinsert it all the way into the 
reservoir.
 
3. Pull the dipstick out again.
 
4. Look at the oil sticking to the end of the stick, which has a mark with 
the label “Full” and “Add” or words to that effect.
 
 If the oil is right at the “Add” mark, you need to add oil — usually just 1 
quart. If it’s below the “Add” mark, pour in another quart and check it 
again after a couple of minutes. Allow time for the oil to run down into 
the reservoir. If oil is still below the “Add” mark, add another quart. 
Keep in mind that you should have checked it sooner and avoided risk-
ing damage to your engine.
Changing the oil
Here are suggestions for changing your oil in an inboard or sterndrive with-
out spilling a drop:
 
1. Remove the oil fill cap or the dipstick on top of the engine.
 
 The oil fill cap says “Oil fill cap” or words to that effect, so you can’t mis-
take it. Removing either the cap or the dipstick before you drain the oil 

239
 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
eliminates the possibility of an air lock that can slow the draining 
process.
 
2. Insert the extractor tube from the Moeller Extractor pump (see “Tools 
and supplies” earlier in this section for more on this pump) into the 
dipstick tube and pump the oil out of the engine.
 
 If you don’t have this pump, buy one or have your dealer change 
your oil.
 
3. Locate the oil filter on the side of the engine, and place rags under it. 
Set a container near the engine to put the old oil filter in.
 
 Some oil filters are mounted on the boat near the engine and have hoses 
connecting them to the engine. These remote oil filters are usually easier 
to change and more accessible.
 
4. Try to loosen the filter by hand by turning it counterclockwise. If it 
doesn’t budge, loosen it with the filter wrench. Carefully remove it — 
it will be full of oil. Pour the oil in your catch bucket, and dispose of 
the filter or recycle it as I explain in the earlier section on four-stroke 
outboard oil changes.
 
5. Dip your finger in the old oil and rub a little oil around the rubber 
seal on the new oil filter so it will seat tightly and smoothly. Screw on 
the new filter.
 
 If you removed the old filter by hand, tighten the new one by hand. If 
you use a wrench, don’t over-tighten the new filter — just make it snug.
 
6. Place a funnel in the oil fill hole on top of the engine, and carefully 
pour in fresh oil. Keep a rag handy in case of spills.
 
 Most marine engines require 5 quarts of oil, but some may require 6 or 
even 7. Consult your owner’s manual or local dealer if you’re unsure of 
the quantity.
 
7. Replace the oil cap, and check the oil level to be sure the appropriate 
amount is indicated on the dipstick.
 
8. Look carefully around the oil filter for signs of oil leaking. If all is oil-
tight, you’re ready to go boating.
 
On inboard and sterndrive boat engines, I’ve seen mechanics remove the 
boat’s drain plug, remove the oil drain plug, and let the oil run into the bilge 
and then out the bilge drain into a bucket for disposal. I’ve even seen them let 
oil run out on the ground, too. Never let the oil run into the bilge, because you 
can never get it completely cleaned out. Every time your bilge pump runs, it 
will pick up the oil residue and pump it out with the bilge water into the water, 
leaving an oily sheen. It’s a bad practice — and it’s illegal.

240
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
Changing the oil in a jet-drive engine
The process for changing oil in a jet-drive engine is the same as for an 
inboard or sterndrive engine. However, jet-drive engines don’t have the 
handy oil drain feature in newer engines made by Mercruiser, so you use an 
extraction pump instead of draining the oil from the bottom of the engine. 
Here are a few points unique to this jet-drive job:
 
✓ Jets are made to run at much higher revolutions per minute (RPMs) than 
other marine engines. This puts an extreme challenge on your oil, so I 
suggest you carefully follow the oil specifications when replacing the oil 
in your engine.
 
✓ You aren’t likely to find oil filters for your jet-drive engine at the auto 
department of a parts or discount store. Get the correct filter from your 
dealer.
Beyond these two concerns, the tools and process of changing oil are much 
the same as for inboard and sterndrive engines, so consult the previous 
section, “Changing inboard and sterndrive engine oil.”
Changing Gear-Case Lubricant 
and Transmission Fluid
The propeller on sterndrives and outboards is attached to a drive shaft that 
extends from the gear case. The gear case is sealed and contains gear-case 
Premium or bargain oil: Does it matter?
Most people know what engine oil is for, but few 
beyond the scientists who blend and validate 
it actually know whether its chemical formula 
stands up to the claims made by advertising. My 
readers at Boating Life magazine often ask me 
whether premium oil is really worth the money. 
Until I was able to wrangle a tour through the 
Shell/Pennzoil blending plant in Texas and the 
private lab that does validation testing for them 
and for the National Marine Manufacturers 
Association (NMMA) that sets minimum stan-
dards for some oils, I didn’t know how to answer 
this question.
My takeaway from the tours was this: You may 
get really good oil from a bargain brand. In fact, 
it’s possible the bargain brand is bottled in a 
premium-brand facility. What you don’t get with 
a bargain brand is the exhaustive validation 
testing required not only to prove the oil works 
as intended but also to substantiate advertising 
claims. In short, I may not always buy the most 
expensive oil, but I will buy oil from brands that 
have the clout and the incentive to prove their 
blends work through such validation testing.

241
 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
lubricant that protects the bearing from wear. This lubricant should be 
changed once a year — usually when you winterize your boat. (I explain win-
terizing, or preparing your boat for long-term storage, in Chapter 14.) Inboard 
engines have transmissions, which need regular attention, too.
This section is about how to change the gear-case lubricant in your out-
board or sterndrive engine and how to manage the transmission fluid in your 
inboard engine. Gear-case lubricant is fairly easy to handle yourself, taking 
only minutes. Best of all, doing it yourself can save a bundle of time and 
money. Transmissions, on the other hand, are more complicated to work 
with.
Changing gear-case lubricant
If your boat has a sterndrive or outboard motor, you can change the gear-
case lubricant yourself. This section explains what you need to do the job 
and how to go about it.
Tools and supplies
You need only one or two tools to change your gear-case lubricant, and the 
correct ones depend on your engine. Here are some considerations:
 
✓ Some boat gear cases have one or two plugs you can remove with a 
large standard screwdriver.
 
✓ Some gear cases have plugs that require a hex wrench to remove them. 
A hex wrench is sometimes called an Allen wrench; it’s L-shaped with 
six sides and fits in screw heads with hexagonal sockets. Hex wrenches 
usually come in complete sets of varying sizes and aren’t expensive. You 
can select the wrench that fits your engine’s gear case drain plug.
 
✓ An adjustable wrench is handy for those gear cases that are opened with 
a standard screwdriver. The plugs often become tight from corrosion, 
and tightening an adjustable wrench on the blade of the screwdriver so 
you can use the wrench as a handle often helps remove the plug more 
easily.
 
✓ To catch the old gear-case lubricant, use a bucket or other container 
capable of holding 2 quarts of fluid with room to spare so you can move 
it without spilling it.
 
✓ Gear-case lubricant, like oil, comes in various weights or grades and 
ordinarily comes in squeeze tubes. Your gear case should hold one or 
two tubes of the correct oil specified in your owner’s manual.

242
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
How to replace the gear-case lubricant
Changing the lubricant in the gear case is a snap. Follow these steps:
 
1. Place a bucket under the gear case to capture the lubricant after you 
remove the drain plugs.
 
2. Locate the two drain plugs in the gear case: One is directly on the 
bottom of the case and the other is higher up, just over the bulging 
part of the case.
 
3. Remove the top drain plug and then the bottom plug, using either the 
standard screwdriver or the hex wrench, depending on your engine.
 
 You open the upper plug to prevent an air lock and the bottom plug to 
drain the gear case.
 
4. Let the gear case drain into the bucket until empty.
 
5. Insert the end of the new tube of lubricant into the bottom drain hole, 
and squeeze it until the tube is empty.
 
 It helps to roll the tube from the bottom like a toothpaste tube.
 
6. When the first tube is empty, place a finger over the top drain hole to 
seal it and create an air lock that lets you insert a second tube of lubri-
cant, if necessary. Continue adding lubricant until some runs out of 
the top drain hole.
 
7. Place your finger over the top hole, and screw in the bottom plug 
without spilling.
 
8. Tighten the bottom plug firmly, and then screw on and tighten the top 
plug.
 
When you drain your gear-case lubricant, what comes out gives you a lot of 
information about the health of your boat’s gears and gear-case seals.
 
✓ If the grease is milky, water is present and the gear-case seals need to be 
replaced.
 
✓ If visible water comes out, your gear-case seals are letting in water and 
you need to get your boat to your dealer before taking it back out onto 
the water.
 
✓ It’s normal to see tiny, fine metal filings stuck to the magnetic gear-case 
plugs. However, particles the size of ice cream sprinkles indicate that 
serious internal damage is occurring in the gear case, probably because 
of improper lubrication or possibly damage from grounding your boat. 
Have it serviced before heading out onto the water.

243
 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
Upper gear cases in sterndrives
Sterndrive engines have a lubricant reservoir attached to the engine that lets 
you monitor the gear-case lubricant level. A tube connects this reservoir to 
the gear case.
The upper gear-case reservoir adds an extra step to the process of changing 
gear-case lubricant, but it eases the process of keeping an eye on lubricant 
levels because you can easily see the level in the reservoir on the engine. If 
you have a sterndrive, here are a couple of steps to add to the steps for gear-
case lubricant that I describe in the previous section:
 
1. Remove the cap of the gear-case lubricant reservoir, which should be 
clearly marked, to be sure the reservoir drains fully along with the 
lower gear case.
 
2. After draining the lower gear case (following the steps in the previous 
section), check that the upper reservoir is also completely drained.
 
3. After refilling the gear case, add additional lubricant to the level indi-
cated on the upper reservoir. It doesn’t refill from the lubricant you 
squeeze into the gear case itself.
 
If you own a classic sterndrive boat — that is, one built before 1988 — the 
upper gear case has to be drained separately from the lower gear case, and 
you don’t have that handy reservoir to keep an eye on levels. However, you’ll 
find the fill hole capped with a screw just like the lower gear case. Now and 
then, remove the cap with a large screwdriver and make sure the lubricant 
level is up to the screw hole. If it isn’t, add lubricant according to your dealer’s 
recommendation.
Checking and changing inboard 
transmission fluid
Instead of a gear case, inboards have a transmission that needs to be ser-
viced periodically. Unfortunately, the process for changing transmission fluid 
is more involved and difficult to manage than checking and changing gear-
case lubricant. You can check the transmission fluid level yourself, but have 
your marine mechanic change the transmission fluid each spring when you 
first take your boat off mothballs and then again later in the boating season, 
at your mechanic’s recommendation.

244
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
Checking the transmission fluid is as simple as checking the oil. Here’s how:
 
1. Locate the transmission fluid reservoir.
 
 On some inboards, the transmission is forward of the engine. On others, 
the transmission is aft the engine (aft means behind, toward the back of 
the boat).
 
2. Unscrew the transmission fluid dipstick, which looks like a screw-
down cap and is marked somehow to tell you it’s for the transmission 
fluid. Remove the dipstick and wipe it clean with a clean rag.
 
3. Reinsert the dipstick, and then remove it and note the level of the fluid 
on the stick, which indicates whether you need to add fluid or not.
 
 In some cases, removing the cap lets you visually check the fluid level 
inside the transmission. If you can see the fluid, you have enough.
 
4. If needed, use a funnel to add transmission fluid as recommended in 
your owner’s manual.
Other Sterndrive Lubricants 
You Should Monitor
If your boat is a sterndrive, you need to keep an eye on one or two other 
fluids in addition to the engine oil and gear-case lubricant. These additional 
fluids include power-steering fluid, if your boat has it, and hydraulic engine 
trim fluid, which all sterndrives have.
 
I can’t tell you how important it is to maintain proper fluid levels in your 
engine. Well, actually I can. Operating any of the functions on the boat with 
low fluid levels can quickly damage the component, costing hundreds of dol-
lars in repairs. It takes only a minute to make sure these levels are full.
Checking the power-steering fluid
Most sterndrive engines built since 2004 are equipped with power steering. 
On the front of the engine is a reservoir marked, as you may have guessed, 
“power-steering fluid” or similar language to that effect. The container lid has 
marks on it for “Full” and “Low” or “Add.”
 
Check the power-steering fluid every time you boat. If needed, add fluid as 
directed in your owner’s manual. Often the correct fluid is indicated on the 
reservoir cap.

 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
Checking the hydraulic engine trim fluid
All sterndrive engines are equipped with hydraulic trim to adjust the angle of 
the propeller up and down for a better ride. (I discuss using your engine trim 
in Chapter 7.)
As with power-steering fluid, there’s a reservoir for trim hydraulic fluid on 
the engine, and it’s marked so you can identify it. Note the “Full” and “Add” 
or “Low” markings on the side, and when necessary add fluid as prescribed 
by your owner’s manual.
Protecting Your Engine from 
the Effects of Ethanol
Mixing ethanol with fuel has become a mandatory step in trying to reduce 
dependence on fossil fuel. Unfortunately, ethanol is bad for engines, particu-
larly for marine engines manufactured before 2004.
This section helps you understand the negative effects ethanol fuel can have 
and what you can do to defend your boat engine against them.
Understanding the negatives of ethanol
You may be for or against using America’s food crops to make ethanol for 
fuel, but your position on the issue doesn’t change the fact that fuel will be 
laced with ethanol for some time to come. You need to be aware of ethanol’s 
damaging impact on engines so you can protect your engine. Here’s a break-
down of the key effects:
 
✓ Ethanol absorbs water vapor from the air, causing water to collect in the 
bottom of your fuel tank. That water can be drawn into your engine and 
destroy it completely. This is much more of a risk in a boat than in a car 
because a boat sits for long periods of time, often with a partial tank of 
fuel, which leaves more air to hold dangerous water vapor.
 
✓ Ethanol delivers less power per gallon than regular gas, causing your 
engine to work harder yet deliver less horsepower. That can lead to 
your engine overheating if your cooling system isn’t up to snuff.
 
✓ Ethanol can dissolve or decay some rubber fuel lines, plastic fittings, 
and gaskets in older boat motors built before 2000 and also in some 
motors built more recently.

246
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
 
✓ Ethanol has dissolved fiberglass fuel tanks — and you’ll hear about it if 
you hang around a marina much. But, for your peace of mind, boats with 
fiberglass fuel tanks are generally older and larger than the power boats 
discussed in this book — so don’t worry much about this one!
Dealing with the effects of ethanol
You can’t do anything about the reduced horsepower your engine delivers 
when burning ethanol, but there are things you can — and must — do to pre-
vent engine damage from ethanol.
 
✓ Keep your boat’s gas tank full. A full tank reduces the contact fuel has 
with air and reduces ethanol’s ability to absorb water vapor into the 
fuel.
 
✓ To prevent ethanol and the water it draws into the gas from turning 
your fuel into varnish or gum, add fuel stabilizers like Pennzoil Fuel 
Stabilizer, PRI-G, or Sta-bil to your gas every time you fill up. I’ll make 
an exception for this if you burn a tankful of gas in your boat every two 
weeks or less, in which case your fuel isn’t sitting long enough to worry 
about.
 
✓ Have a fuel/water separator installed on your boat, if it doesn’t 
already have one. Your fuel/water separator should have a 10-micron 
filter media in it to efficiently capture water in the fuel. A fuel/water 
separator looks a lot like an oil filter. It’s mounted inside the engine com-
partment with the fuel line from the gas tank running into it and the fuel 
line to the engine running out of it.
 
 Check the fuel/water separator every week or so by shutting off the fuel 
supply to it with the faucet-like valve located near the separator. Then 
unscrew the separator canister — it’s just like unscrewing an oil filter — 
and carefully empty it and inspect the contents. If you see any sign of 
water in it, check your separator every time you fill up your boat or 
every time you leave your boat unattended for a week or more. If you 
find the filter full of water, you need to empty the water in an environ-
mentally safe place and replace the separator filter.
 
✓ Run your boat often to keep the fuel fresh and oil circulated through-
out the engine. Nothing is better for a boat than frequent use along with 
normal maintenance.

Monitoring Engine Gauges
Automobiles have become so reliable that most people don’t know what 
all the lights and symbols on their dashboards mean. Marine engines are 
approaching that level of reliability, but there’s still a ways to go. And 
because it’s hard to thumb a ride home when your boat breaks down, it’s 
always important to keep an eye on indicators and gauges at the helm and 
keep an ear out for engine troubles when you’re on the water. Your instru-
ment indicators and gauges are there both to reassure you and warn you, so 
make sure you get a feel for the following common ones:
 
✓ Buzzers and beepers: Buzzers and beepers are installed on most boats 
fewer than ten years old to tell you when something is going wrong. 
When you hear one, stop and check all fluid reservoirs on your engine. 
Look at the temperature gauge to see if it’s overheating, reduce your 
RPMs to minimum speed, and limp in to a mechanic.
 
✓ Oil-pressure gauge: An oil-pressure gauge tells you whether oil is circu-
lating properly to your engine. If you see that number fall below what 
the operator’s manual says is normal for your engine, you’d better slow 
down and limp in to a mechanic.
 
✓ Smart instruments: Smart instruments are instruments that can read 
computer codes sent by your engine’s onboard computer, if it has one. 
Some motor companies call this computer the engine management 
module (EMM) or electronic control module (ECM) or something along 
those lines. When the module detects something going wrong with the 
engine, it sends a specific code to the instruments telling you the engine 
is overheating, low on oil or other fluids, or otherwise malfunctioning. 
These systems are expensive but give great peace of mind to journey-
ing boaters. They often tell you exactly what your engine needs to solve 
its problem. Unfortunately, these systems are available only for newer 
engines, and retrofitting usually isn’t possible.
 
✓ Speedometer: A speedometer isn’t much good alone for detecting 
engine problems, but when you compare speed to RPMs and detect a 
slower-than-usual speed at a given RPM, you’re noticing loss of power, 
which is a good reason to visit your mechanic.
 
✓ Tachometer: A tachometer tells how fast the engine is running in RPMs 
by way of a sensor that detects how fast the crankshaft is turning. The 
crankshaft is the part that transfers the power of the fuel burning in the 
engine to the propeller shaft and in turn to the propeller. If your engine 
begins to lose RPMs, that’s a sign something is going wrong inside the 
engine. The quicker you get it to a shop for repair, the better.

248
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
 
✓ Temperature gauge: A temperature gauge monitors the engine tempera-
ture. Most gasoline engines and diesels are designed to operate at tem-
peratures under 180 degrees (check your engine’s manual to be sure). 
If you see a temperature running higher than the norm, it’s time to slow 
down, return to port, and see your mechanic.
 
✓ Voltage meter: A voltage meter tells how much voltage your battery has. 
If it’s less than 11.5 volts, don’t shut off the motor because you may not 
get it restarted. The culprit could be your battery or alternator, the part 
on your engine that recharges your battery.
Maintaining Your Boat’s Battery
Even if you turn out the running lights, turn off the stereo, and shut down 
every other thing that can use battery juice, your boat battery can still run 
down between weekend outings. Marine stereos, for instance, continuously 
draw a little bit of power to keep programmed radio stations in memory. So, 
to keep your battery at its best, a battery charger is essential.
When a boat won’t start, it’s usually because the battery has run down. It’s 
easy to avoid that frustrating delay and, in the process, keep your battery 
working better longer. Boats are harder on batteries than cars are, so I share 
some special considerations to bear in mind to make sure your boating 
outing doesn’t end before it starts. In this section I give you the lowdown on 
using chargers, as well as how to know when you need a new battery.
Note: Electric trolling motors like those used on bass and walleye boats 
(described in Chapter 2) usually require a deep-cycle battery. Unlike your pri-
mary marine battery that’s closer to your car battery, deep-cycle batteries 
work better when they’re fully drained before recharging.
 
If you have a charger you bought ten years ago for your car or motorcycle bat-
tery, I recommend that you look into buying one of the new automatic marine 
chargers available today for your boat. These new chargers use computer 
wizardry to measure the charge and condition of your battery, and they auto-
matically match the charging current to the battery’s needs. When the battery 
reaches full charge, the charger completely stops putting out current, with 
the exception of an occasional test pulse that it uses to analyze the battery’s 
current condition. When the charger detects a decline in current, it ramps up 
again and recharges.
In the old days, an automatic charger constantly pushed current to a battery 
even though undergoing a constant current tended to reduce the battery’s 

249
 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
capacity power over time. Even a small amount of charging current from 
these older chargers can wreck a battery if left on too long.
When you buy a new battery charger, make sure it
 
✓ Has a meter to tell you the condition of the battery. Some meters are in 
the form of a gauge with a needle, and some come with a multicolor LED 
readout. The LED readouts are easier to interpret — one color indicates 
the battery is fully charged, another indicates the battery is charging, 
and another indicates it’s partially charged. These colors take away the 
guesswork.
 
✓ Is specifically designed for marine applications. These models are built 
with more resistance against water and corrosion, and they’ll work on 
your car or motorcycle, too, if you find yourself in a battery bind.
 
✓ Has a maximum output of 10 amps unless you want to wait all day for 
your battery to recharge. Amps are a measurement of how much current 
the charger puts into the battery. Less power means more time waiting 
for the recharge.
The four types of marine battery chargers to consider are
 
✓ Solar: Best for keeping a small charge going to the battery during stor-
age. This charger is just enough to keep the battery topped off and 
doesn’t require a wall plug to operate! But solar chargers only work in 
direct sun, so they aren’t much help in a boat stored under a roof.
 
✓ Built-in: Work just like portable chargers but are waterproof and remain 
in the boat. All you have to do is plug the 110-volt lead into the wall 
socket, and the charger monitors and properly charges the battery.
 
✓ Portable: Carried to the boat, connected to a battery, and then plugged 
into 110-volt power. This charger connects to just one battery at a time, 
and you have to monitor the charging process and move the battery 
charger to subsequent batteries as needed.
 
✓ Battery packs: Not really battery chargers but rather jump-start devices. 
Packs have their own 12-volt power and can store it for long periods of 
time without being plugged in for a recharge.
Getting power from the sun with solar chargers
Solar chargers are just what they sound like, and they’re very handy for keep-
ing a battery charge maintained over long periods of storage. Shown in Figure 
13-1, this charger’s positive red lead and negative black lead bolt right onto 
the battery terminals. When you store the boat for long periods, you can tem-
porarily attach the solar panel to your boat or boat cover, and the sun will 
keep your battery fresh and ready for the next adventure.

Using built-in chargers to save time and work
Built-in chargers are made to fasten inside the boat, usually in the bilge or 
engine compartment, and remain there for the life of the boat. They’re water-
proof and have a 110-volt lead that plugs into a wall socket and two or three 
pairs of charging leads. These systems are ideal for boats with more than one 
battery; instead of lugging the charger and transferring it from dead battery 
to dead battery, you keep all the connections in place and the battery char-
ger does the work of determining which battery to charge.
Rescuing the day with a battery pack
A battery pack holds a small 12-volt battery with a wall plug to recharge it. It 
holds a charge for months and is a great device to keep in your tow vehicle. If 
your boat battery is dead, you can hook up the battery pack and voila! When 
your boat starts, you can stow the battery pack and let your motor recharge 
the battery, which takes about 30 minutes of running time.

251
 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
Using a battery charger
Batteries that aren’t recharged regularly and kept fully charged tend to 
lose their charge potential. Each time you let your battery drain of power, 
it loses some of its ability to store electrical power. The best thing you can 
do for your boat battery is use it frequently so the engine alternator keeps it 
charged and in top shape. You can expect two or three years of use out of a 
marine starter battery if you avoid frequently discharging it completely.
Using a battery charger is easy:
 
1. Turn off the battery isolator switch, if your boat has one, to isolate 
your battery.
 
 This step prevents items on the boat from sapping the charge current 
and prevents charge pulses from going into the boat’s system.
 
 Most boats made since 2000 have one or more battery isolator switches 
(see Figure 13-2) located near the batteries, either in the engine com-
partment or behind a small door near the transom (the back wall of the 
boat). Some single-engine boats have one battery for the engine and one 
for the house, or all the things onboard you need to run. Turn isolator 
switches to the off position whenever you secure your boat to the trailer 
for storage so that nothing accidentally left on in the boat can drain your 
battery.

lator switch.

2. Attach the red clamp from the charger to the positive post on the 
battery.
 
 The positive post has a “+” mark and a red cable bolted to it. Always 
hook up the red post and clamp first to reduce the chance that sparks 
could cause a fire.
 
3. Hook the black clamp to the negative post on the battery.
 
 The negative post has a “–” mark and a black cable attached to it.
 
4. Plug the charger’s 110-volt power cord into a wall socket.
 
 All battery chargers come with a 110-volt cord for electricity and battery 
cables with red and black clothespin-type clamps to connect to your 
boat’s battery.
 
5. You may have to wait 15 minutes or so for the battery and charger to 
get a “dialogue” going so that charging can commence.
 
 The indicator gauge or LED on the charger indicates that the charge 
is taking place, unless the battery is sooooo dead that it can’t detect 
enough current to determine its own status. If the charger indicates that 
the battery is faulty, the battery may be ready for the recycling dump or 
fully discharged with no readable current, in which case, unfortunately, 
an automatic charger won’t help.
Replacing a worn-out battery
After a couple of years of boating bliss, your starting battery will need to be 
replaced. If you wait until it refuses to hold a charge from one day until the 
next or until you hear it turning the engine slowly after being fully charged, 
you’ve waited too long to change it. When the time comes, swap the old one 
for a new marine starting battery. Marine batteries are made with sturdier 
components than automobile batteries to resist damage from the occasional 
complete discharge and to hold charges longer between uses.
 
If your boat isn’t equipped with an electric trolling motor, you can skip this 
tip. If you do have a boat with electric motors, be sure to replace your batter-
ies with deep-cycle batteries. Deep-cycle batteries are designed to be nearly 
fully discharged and recharged repeatedly without damage. They’re bigger 
and heavier than other batteries and store more power.

 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
Washing, Waxing, and Preserving 
Your Boat’s Good Looks
That gleaming finish on your boat is more fragile than the shine on your car. 
The finish coat on your boat is called gelcoat, and it’s porous and absorbs 
moisture instead of repelling it like the clear-coat finish on your car.
The porous gelcoat means that things that get on your boat, like bird drop-
pings and road grime from trailering, will soak into it if they aren’t removed 
quickly and with the correct soaps. They can leave stains that are difficult 
and sometimes impossible to remove if you don’t act quickly.
You may be tempted to get out your car washing and waxing products to 
spiff up your boat, but this section tells you why that’s a bad idea. I help you 
select the best boat-friendly cleaning tools and products because there really 
is a difference between washing your car and washing and protecting your 
boat.
Getting the right boat-cleaning tools
You can wash your boat with a rag, but it will take about 3 hours, and you 
can dry it with a towel, but that will take about 12 hours. Special boat-cleaning 
tools are designed to ease the labor, lessen the risk of damaging your hull, 
and get you back to boating faster. Following are some goodies you’ll find 
very handy for a Sunday-afternoon spiff-up of your boat; all should be avail-
able at your local marine-supply store:
 
✓ Boat brush: For general hull cleaning, use a soft-bristled boat brush with 
an adjustable-length handle. The soft bristles don’t scratch the boat, and 
they don’t absorb and hold grit that can be rubbed back into the gelcoat 
and risk scratching it. You can lengthen the adjustable handle to reach 
between the trailer and hull without crawling underneath it, and you can 
shorten the handle for cleaning the inside of the boat without bumping 
into things.
 
✓ Bucket: A five-gallon bucket is practically indispensible for boat clean-
ing and rinsing. Some boats even include racks to hold such a bucket. 
If you’d rather not buy a bucket from a marine-supply store, rinse the 
paint from an empty five-gallon paint bucket — you can usually mooch 
one from a friendly contractor.

254
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
 
✓ Microfiber towels: Use microfiber towels to get into the tight spots your 
brush won’t reach. Microfiber towels are made of fibers so fine that 
they’re touted to get under grit and lift it away, whereas a rag or sponge 
may rub grit in, causing fine scratches. I can’t scientifically back the 
claim, but I use microfiber towels on my boat and believe they work.
 
✓ Silicone squeegee: A silicone squeegee is the simplest way to slap water 
off the hull and upholstery. It’s also a handy tool early in the morning 
to squeegee dew from the windshield without leaving smears or dirty 
streaks.
 
✓ Synthetic chamois: You can wipe every little smidge of water off 
your boat with a synthetic chamois. And it will take only one chamois 
because you can wring it almost dry and wipe some more.
 
 Avoid using a natural chamois on your boat. Synthetics are best because 
they have antimicrobial treatment to prevent mildew, something you’re 
always fighting around a boat.
Using the right soaps and waxes for boats
Marine soaps and waxes are often formulated in consultation with the manu-
facturers of gelcoat and marine vinyl to ensure the formulations will protect 
and not harm the surfaces. The soaps and waxes cost more than automobile 
or household cleaning products mostly because they’re manufactured and 
sold on a smaller scale and sometimes because the ingredients cost more.
 
Don’t be tempted to use car care products on your boat because they’re less 
expensive. You may save money in the short run, but over the years you’ll see 
what happens when you don’t go with the boat soap and wax: Your gelcoat 
fades and cracks, and your prize boat begins to look like a derelict.
You may as well stock up on a supply of the following products now because 
you’ll need them off and on all summer long. You really don’t need me to tell 
you how to use them, I think, because — well, you use them like most other 
soaps and waxes, and each product comes with its own instructions. The fol-
lowing items are in order of recommended importance:
 
✓ Boat wax: Boat waxes are designed to rub into gelcoats easily and pro-
vide a strong UV protection layer along with the gloss.
 
 You should wax your boat twice a year if it’s white and four times a year 
if it has a colored gelcoat. Colors absorb more ultraviolet (UV) light, 
which causes them to grow hazy faster than white gelcoats. If you don’t 
wax regularly, the shine dulls and the color fades to a chalky finish.

255
 Chapter 13: Keeping Up with Routine Boat Maintenance
 
✓ Boat-washing soap: Boat-washing soap comes in many colors and 
aromas. Using one that lacks dyes and aromas is considered better for 
the environment. (I explain more on this in the sidebar “Going green 
with approved boat-care products.”) And don’t pay extra for soap that 
touts wax as an additional ingredient; it doesn’t substitute for actually 
waxing your boat with boat wax.
 
✓ Non-skid deck cleaner: Non-skid deck cleaner is mandatory for cleaning 
a textured deck and sole (the floor of the cockpit and bow seating area, 
which most people mistakenly call the “deck”), and it’s the only cleaner 
that can remove black shoe or grease marks.
 
✓ Black streak remover: Black streak remover is for the outside of your 
boat, mostly. These marks develop on your boat when it rubs against 
docks, your trailer, or other boats. With a little elbow grease, most black 
marks come off with boat soap or wax, but some are stubborn; because 
streak remover does the job quicker and easier and doesn’t use up your 
boat soap and wax, it’s a good addition to the cleaning kit.
 
✓ Spray wash-and-wax: Spray wash-and-wax is handy for an afternoon 
touch-up on the boat. It comes in a pump-spray bottle, so you spray it 
on and wipe it off. Spray wash-and-wax gives an awesome final clean 
touch to the boat in a hurry, and unlike boat soap, it has a meaningful 
concentration of wax to help repel dirt and water.
Going green with approved boat-care products
There’s a new movement among boaters 
toward green, earth-friendly cleaning prod-
ucts. Everything you do to your boat impacts 
the water, and the products you use to clean 
and wax it are no exception.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
has established a department called Design for 
the Environment to help you know if a product 
is really green. The EPA’s enormous database 
of chemicals and their properties allows the 
agency to analyze the ingredient list in products 
and compare it to their high standards for earth-
friendly products. Manufacturers who partici-
pate in the process and show they have chosen 
green ingredients get to use the Design for the 
Environment logo seen here on their product’s 
label. Yep, these products cost more, but they 
work without polluting boating waters.

256
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
 
✓ Upholstery cleaners: Upholstery cleaners for boats are formulated to 
clean many stains. Some also contain vinyl conditioners and UV shield.
 
✓ UV inhibitor for vinyl: UV inhibitor for your vinyl upholstery is impera-
tive, even if your upholstery cleaner already contains some UV shield. 
Without UV inhibitor, your vinyl will stiffen and crack in just a couple 
of years. You should take a few minutes to wipe on some UV inhibitor 
every time you bring your boat home or prepare it for storage after a 
day on the way.

Getting Your Boat Ready 
for Winter and Spring
In This Chapter
▶ Protecting your boat against winter’s chills by checking and draining fluids
▶ Covering your boat properly to guard against moisture
▶ Warming up your boat for spring boating
T
he last boat trip out for me is the saddest of the year. It’s the end of the 
season and the beginning of that dreary time when the boat is tucked away 
in storage, hibernating. You may be surprised to know that your boat’s engine 
can suffer some of the worst damage possible when your boat is stowed away 
for weeks or months. It makes little difference whether you store the boat for 
the winter or just don’t use it for several months in the summer — things can 
go wrong inside your boat’s engine if you don’t prepare.
When your boat goes unused, fuel can decay and turn to varnish, coat-
ing your fuel tank, fuel lines, and especially your carburetor, with gum and 
sludge that will slough off and clog your engine. Oil that normally circulates 
throughout your engine when you run it no longer circulates, and after a few 
weeks, the inside of the engine is exposed to corrosion as the oil drains to 
the oil pan at the bottom of the engine. Worst of all, the water that inboard 
engines and sterndrive engines hold in their cooling channels, water pump, 
and exhaust manifold may freeze inside the engine; when that water freezes, 
it expands and breaks apart the heavy-cast steel, completely destroying the 
engine.
Those things never have to happen to your engine. This chapter is all about 
how to prevent damage to your engine during storage by treating the gas 
so it doesn’t degrade, fogging the engine so it doesn’t rust, and draining the 
water so it doesn’t freeze and break your motor.

258
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
When you get the boat ready to go in the spring — boaters call it 
re-commissioning — you want to double-check that the preventive measures 
you took in the fall left your engine and boat ready for the summer. The 
treated fuel will be just fine, but your boat may be sluggish to start anyway. 
At the end of this chapter, I give you some tips to get it going again.
 
You’ll often hear the term “winterize” used for the process of preparing your 
boat for winter storage. But the truth is, any time your boat sits unused for 
more than a few weeks, you should follow all the steps in this chapter for stor-
ing your engine — except maybe draining water from the engine, which isn’t 
necessary in the summer. Just don’t forget to drain the water before the first 
freeze!
Preserving Your Fuel and Engine
Each engine type requires that you take unique steps to protect it from the 
elements during storage. Only two steps are common to all kinds of engines: 
stabilizing the fuel to prevent fuel spoilage and varnishing, and fogging the 
cylinders to prevent corrosion. These are easiest to do while your boat is on 
the trailer and in the water on a ramp. Try to do these tasks at a time when 
other boaters aren’t waiting on the ramp, or do them at a ramp with many 
lanes so boaters can work around you. (If performing these tasks while your 
boat’s in the water isn’t practical, see the Tip later in this section for a trick 
for doing them on dry land.)
Follow these steps to stabilize the fuel and then fog the cylinders:
 
1. Determine the capacity of your fuel tank.
 
2. Before you load the boat onto the trailer after its last run of the 
season, add a fuel stabilizer to the tank in an amount sufficient to 
treat the fuel capacity. Then, if your tank isn’t full, gas up all the way.
 
3. Drive your boat around the lake for at least five minutes to mix the 
stabilizer into the fuel.
 
4. Load your boat on the trailer, but leave it running in the water for the 
next steps.
 
5. In a sterndrive, inboard, or jet boat, open the engine hatch and 
remove the plastic cowl by turning the screws until loose.
 
 Some engines have plastic fasteners you simply twist with your fingers.
 
 On an outboard, locate the latches and remove the plastic throttle 
body cover on the front of the engine.
 
6. In a sterndrive, inboard, or jet boat, remove the flame arrestor on top 
of the engine.

259
 Chapter 14: Getting Your Boat Ready for Winter and Spring
 
 It looks like an air filter and has a wing nut on top. Unscrew and remove 
it. Underneath is the throttle body or carburetor.
 
 In an outboard, a plastic throttle body cover is usually on the side of 
the engine facing the boat. Loosen the screws or fasteners to reveal 
the carburetors or the throttle body air intakes, depending on the 
type of engine.
 
7. Spray an entire can of fogging solution (available at any marine store 
or in most marine departments of discount stores) into the engine’s 
carburetor or throttle body until it smokes heavily, stalls, and dies.
 
 On an outboard, you may have more than one carburetor or throttle 
body intake. Alternate between them, spraying the can inside them. 
Sometimes you’ll run out of fogging spray before the engine stalls. Just 
shut the engine off when the spray can is empty — you’ve still done a 
great job!
 
If your boat is on dry land, fogging your cylinders is easy if you get a pair of 
what mechanics call ear muffs. You can find them in any marine department 
of a discount store or a marine retailer. Attach a garden hose to the ear muffs 
and fit them over the water intake ports on the gear case. Turn on the water, 
and the muffs supply cooling water to the water pump and engine so you 
can run it in the driveway. Then follow the preceding steps for fogging your 
engine.
Changing Your Oil for Long-term Storage
Some mechanics suggest you change the oil before you store your boat, and 
some suggest you change the oil after you take it out of storage. Others sug-
gest you do it both before and after, eliminating the bad oil before storage 
and eliminating the possibility of oil contamination after storage.
 
I checked with some engine manufacturers, and their recommendation is 
to change the oil once a year — before you store the boat. (However, your 
engine owner’s manual may also instruct you to change the oil “every X hours 
of operation,” meaning that you change the oil more than once a year; be 
sure to consult the manual for clarification.) Moisture in the oil occurs as the 
engine heats up and cools down repeatedly from use, a condition that won’t 
occur when the engine and boat are in storage. So save yourself an extra oil 
change and the headache that contaminated oil causes. Change your oil before 
you store your boat, and it will be ready for boating when you want it.
To change the oil for long-term storage, follow the same steps for changing 
the oil I explain in Chapter 13.

Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
Preventing Your Engine from Freezing Up
Your marine engine uses the same water you boat in to cool itself off. 
Whenever you load the boat on the trailer and turn it off, some of this water 
stays in the engine. Before storing your boat for the winter, you have to drain 
out this water, because freezing water expands with so much force that it 
can crack and ruin your engine. Here are the steps to follow for draining the 
water from your engine:
 
1. When the boat is on the trailer and on flat ground, find the engine 
drain plugs or petcocks — which are like small faucets — that keep 
the water in your engine. Open them to drain the water.
 
 Your boat may have both or either — and it will have several of them 
(check your owner’s manual). You can remove drain plugs with an 
adjustable wrench and twist open petcocks with your hands.
 
2. Find the manifolds that carry the exhaust away from your engine, and 
open or remove their drain plugs or petcocks to allow the water to 
drain.
 
 The manifolds are the large pipes on either side of the engine that con-
tain cooling water.
 
3. Drain water-pump hoses and the water pump on the front of the 
engine if necessary.
 
 To drain these hoses, it’s best to use a screwdriver to loosen the hose 
clamps around the lowest ends of the hoses and remove the hoses to let 
the water in them drain out. There’s no need to remove both ends of the 
hoses.
 
4. Sterndrives have a rubber bellows at the back of the engine near the 
transom. It’s a difficult spot to get to, but it’s a good idea to open that 
hose clamp as well to make sure no water remains there.
 
Every engine has a slightly different configuration of drain plugs and petcocks. 
It’s essential that you consult your owner’s manual to determine the number 
and location of these draining points. Miss just one this winter and let it 
freeze, and you’ll be forced to buy a new engine in the spring — for $7,000 to 
$25,000 or more, depending on the engine!
 
One thing that makes outboards popular is that they automatically drain with-
out any effort, giving you the option of getting the boat out of hibernation for 
an unseasonably warm winter day and taking a quick ride.

 Chapter 14: Getting Your Boat Ready for Winter and Spring
Keeping Your Battery in 
Shape for Spring
Boat batteries suffer from long periods of storage. As yours loses its charge 
and stays that way for weeks, metal plates in it degrade, reducing or even 
ending the battery’s ability to take a charge next time you want it to work.
Proper care can prevent that, though. Here are my suggestions for keeping 
your battery ready for the next trip:
 
✓ Turn off the boat’s battery switches so nothing inadvertently left on can 
run and overheat, not to mention discharge your batteries.
 
✓ Purchase an automated battery maintenance charger, and connect it 
to your battery. The chargers will constantly monitor your battery and 
send charging current only when it shows a decline in charge. You have 
several types of chargers to consider; here are some of my suggestions:
 
• Xtreme Charge battery chargers have a feature called “pulse tech” 
that sends a power pulse to the battery and causes sulfation on the 
plates to dissolve. Sulfation is a chemical process that degrades a 
battery’s ability to take a charge.
 
• Built-in automatic chargers are handy and come with connectors 
for multiple battery systems of up to three batteries. Chargers 
from Minnkota, Pro Mariner, and Guest are all waterproof and can 
be permanently installed on the boat. When plugged in, they keep 
your batteries at peak performance. If, during use, a battery goes 
dead for any reason, all you need is an extension cord to get the 
charge going. These chargers often keep boaters happily playing 
stereos and running TVs and 12-volt appliances at the dock as well.
How to Freeze-proof Your Plumbing
Many boats have plumbing systems for heads (that’s boat-speak for bath-
room and toilet), freshwater sinks, showers, or galleys. These fixtures can be 
in the cockpit seating area or in the cuddy cabin. Swimmers and skiers often 
enjoy showers on the swim platform on the transom (back of the boat). In 
addition, storage compartments in all boats and livewells and livewell plumb-
ing used in fishing boats to keep fish or bait alive also can hold water.
All this plumbing must be drained of water before storage so that it doesn’t 
freeze and break pipes or fittings during cold-weather storage.

262
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
Freshwater systems
If you have a transom shower, galley, or head with plumbing, do the following 
to make sure they’re fit and ready for the next time you boat:
 
1. Locate the water tank in your boat.
 
 Most are in the bilge area, near the engine. You’ll be able to tell how 
much water it holds by looking at the translucent tank and noting the 
water line.
 
2. Drain all the water from this tank.
 
 You can do this by running the sink or shower until the tank is empty, or 
if the tank has a drain plug you can access, open or unscrew that and let 
it drain to the bilge. You should already have the drain plug out if your 
boat is on the trailer, and the water will drain right out on the ground.
 
3. Pour a gallon or two of nontoxic RV antifreeze into your water tank.
 
 This fluid is red, not green like very toxic automotive antifreeze.
 
4. Pump the antifreeze through your system by opening faucets and let-
ting them run until the antifreeze comes through.
 
 Run each sink faucet until a few ounces of antifreeze go down the drain 
to replace any water in the sink traps (if your boat has traps; don’t 
worry if you don’t know about sink traps — just run the fluid down the 
drain).
Locker drains and other plumbing
Your boat has various drains in it that empty the livewell and storage lockers 
under the deck of your boat. Here’s how to insure they stay free of freezing 
water for the winter:
 
1. Remove any debris, leaves, trash, or other items from the livewells 
and other lockers so that if water enters during the storage period, it 
can drain away.
 
2. Inspect the livewells and lockers to make sure they’re drained.
 
 Most livewells and lockers drain completely when the boat is sitting 
level on a trailer or in a storage rack, but checking them is the best way 
to be safe.
 
3. If you see any water standing in the bottom of the compartments or 
even a small amount in the drain, pour in some nontoxic RV anti-
freeze to prevent the water from freezing.

263
 Chapter 14: Getting Your Boat Ready for Winter and Spring
The bilge
Even when you cover your boat, water can get inside, either by seepage 
through the cover fabric or by condensation that can form on the inside 
of the cover. Follow these steps to ensure that this moisture can escape 
through the bilge:
 
1. Double-check to be sure the drain plug is out.
 
 Store this plug in a place where you’ll easily find it the next time you 
boat.
 
2. Look inside the bilge and remove any dirt or debris that may work its 
way to the drain and interfere with drainage.
 
 Allowing even a small volume of water to sit in the bilge all winter 
because of a blocked drain could have bad consequences.
Covering the Boat Lengthens Its Life
A taught, water-tight mooring cover is absolutely essential to the long life of 
your boat. Letting rain and snow and ice collect in your boat over the storage 
season can result in cracked through-hull fittings and loosened deck fittings, 
such as hinges, as the moisture thaws and freezes repeatedly. At best, your 
upholstery’s padding will be waterlogged, staples holding it in place will cor-
rode and come apart, and mildew will set in when the temperature warms.
Here’s what to look for in a boat cover:
 
✓ The cover needs to be snug and taught so precipitation runs off or, in 
the case of snow, slides off.
 
✓ The fabric needs to be waterproof so precipitation doesn’t penetrate. 
Seams should be double-stitched to strengthen them and minimize mois-
ture intrusion through stitches.
 
✓ Tie-downs around the edges of the fabric should be sturdy and long 
enough to securely attach to the trailer to maintain the cover’s tension.
 
✓ Broad areas of canvas should be supported with adjustable tent poles 
that increase the cover’s ability to slough off precipitation.
 
 The poles should come with a custom cover. If you buy a mass-
produced, generic cover, you need to buy the poles separately.
 
✓ Air vents should be placed in the cover to allow air flow in and out of the 
boat, and the vents should be designed to prevent water from running 
inside.

264
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
 
Some boaters cover their mooring covers with inexpensive plastic tarps to 
extend the lives of their covers. Because the plastic is slick, snow and ice 
slip off more easily. I don’t see anything wrong with this unless you block the 
vents of your cover, preventing air exchange and causing moisture build-up 
inside.
How to Get Your Boat 
Ready in the Spring
When the long winter is over and warm weather is again approaching, you’ll 
likely be more than ready to get your boat back out and have some fun. If you 
winterized your boat properly, getting the boat ready for springtime boating 
is a snap. Here’s all there is to it:
 
1. Double-check the battery charge and connect a charger if needed.
 
2. Close all the engine drain plugs and/or petcocks you opened to drain.
 
3. Double-check the oil and fluid levels to make sure none leaked out 
during storage.
 
 If there’s a sign of leakage, consult a mechanic to make sure service isn’t 
necessary.
 
4. Launch the boat and crank it up.
 
 If your boat is an outboard, you need to squeeze the fuel priming bulb 
on your fuel tank. If the motor is over 90 horsepower, you may also have 
an oil-priming bulb on your oil tank that needs squeezed. (You’ll find the 
oil tank under a hatch near the motor.)
 
 If your boat is an inboard, sterndrive, or jet drive, prime the fuel system 
by pressing the throttle forward three or four times before turning the 
key. Press the shift-release button at the center of the shift/throttle 
handle to prevent the engine from going in gear, and then crank it up!

B
oats operate in a harsh environment. Motorists are apt to complain 
about the occasional pothole in an otherwise smooth road, but boats 
bash over much bigger “potholes” in the form of waves all day long, all 
season long. Naturally, things loosen up under this torture.
It pays to keep an eagle eye out for little loose screws, rattling hinges, and 
other things that wear out from the constant motion and to repair them 
as they crop up. A great deal of major repairs to boats are necessary not 
because of accidents or defective equipment but because their owners failed 
to stay on top of fixing the little things in a boat as soon as they cropped up.
This chapter shows you why you need to keep on top of loose screws and 
fittings, defective engine belts, and loose wiring. It also tells you a good deal 
about what you can do yourself, in your spare time, to keep your boat work-
ing beautifully with minimum downtime because of avoidable damage and 
repairs.
 
Whenever you invite guests on your boat, show them how all the things they 
may have to operate work. Teach them how to open the hatches and relatch 
them and how to deploy the boarding ladder and return it to position. If seats 
recline or adjust, show them how to accomplish that. Their boating experi-
ence will be better and so will yours, because they’ll be less likely to break 
things!

266
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
Doing Quick Repairs to Keep 
Things from Getting Worse
Around your house, you may ignore or work around little problems like a 
sticky door latch, loose cabinet hinge, or leaky faucet. It’s easy to do; every-
thing still seems to stay put, and life goes on thanks to new and automatic 
reflexes to handle the latch, hinge, or faucet more carefully. In a boat, though, 
with constant motion and pounding on the waves, loose things break and 
little leaks can become catastrophic.
Because small inconveniences can quickly and easily become big problems 
when it comes to your boat, I give you some advice on what to tighten and 
seal up.
Fix leaks
I probably don’t need to tell you a boat works by keeping water out and not 
letting it in. But water, being what it is, wants to be where it isn’t wanted. Just 
ask the folks living along the Mississippi River any given spring season as the 
water level creeps higher and higher, and they’ll concur.
If your crew is hangin’ out on the hook (that’s boat-speak for goofing off while 
at anchor), swimming, or getting in and out of the boat for various water-
sports activities, they’ll drag water into the boat with them. Small amounts of 
water in a boat are normal at all times, and a little water on deck is nothing to 
worry about.
If your boat is built to the best standards of the National Marine Manufacturers 
Association (NMMA), it will have a bilge pump that automatically detects water 
in the bilge and pumps it out. (The bilge is the area that holds the engine in an 
inboard. You still have a bilge in an outboard, but the engine isn’t in it — it’s 
on the outside.) If you see or hear your bilge pump jump into action every few 
minutes or so, then you have a leak you need to address.
 
A leak that keeps triggering your bilge pump doesn’t have to immediately end 
your day, but you have to keep track of your battery levels, because the bilge 
pump could gradually drain your battery. Keep an eye on the voltage gauge, 
and if needed, clear everyone away from the propeller and start the motor 
periodically to recharge the battery.
In the long run, the annoying leak will get worse, so here are some consider-
ations for finding and fixing leaks:

267
 Chapter 15: Repairing Leaks and Other Damage to Your Boat
 
✓ Visually inspect every through-hull fitting and watch for a telltale drip 
or a small rivulet (or a large, obvious leak) running down the inside of 
the hull from any fitting. Tighten the clamp with a screwdriver — the 
repair is often as simple as that. If the leak is between the fitting and 
the hull, you have to fix it when the boat is on the trailer after things dry 
out. Follow these basic steps for fixing leaks in through-hull fittings:
 
1. Loosen the locking nut on the inside of the hull, and push the fit-
ting outside the hull so you can work on it from outside the boat. 
You can leave the hose attached for this.
 
2. Clean the hull area around the hole, apply marine sealant (clear 
sealant for a colored hull, white sealant for a white hull) around 
the fitting, and put it back in the hole.
 
3. Have someone else tighten the locking nut from the inside — not 
too tight or you’ll break it or damage the hull core. Just make it 
snug.
 
4. Let the sealant cure according to the directions on the sealant 
packaging.
 
✓ Check every fitting screwed onto the hull below the waterline. You 
can look for these leaks while the boat is in the water. You may find 
loose screws holding a depth-finder transducer on the transom or a 
water-temperature sensor, boarding ladder brackets, or a trim tab onto 
the hull. (Trim tabs are the adjustable metal tabs on the back of the 
boat.) Follow these steps for fixing screw hole leaks:
 
1. Remove the screw.
 
2. Squeeze some sealant into the hole.
 
3. Replace the screw.
 
 If you think the screws on a trim tab are the culprits, follow the steps 
one screw at a time, letting the other screws hold the tab in place until 
you’ve resealed each screw.
 
✓ You didn’t leave the bilge drain plug out when you launched, did 
you?! If you left the drain plug out, join the club! Everybody’s done it 
once, at least. Put the plug into that tiny little hole under the motor, and 
then let the bilge pump run to pump the water back out.
Tighten or replace bolts and screws
Keep both a standard screwdriver and a Phillips screwdriver handy on your 
boat to double-check suspicious screws immediately. If you don’t tighten or 
replace them when they need it, they’ll only get worse.
I have a boat with a hard top bolted to a tubular frame. One bolt came out 
last summer and, because the top was still secure, I didn’t rush to fix it. When 

268
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
I ran the boat one rainy day, I noticed water dripping out of a couple of light 
fixtures. Turns out the hole left by the missing bolt allowed water to enter 
into the hard top, and the water shorted out an important light. It took about 
three minutes to replace the bolt with a wrench and caulk it. It took hours 
and $60 to replace the light damaged by letting the missing bolt go unfixed a 
little bit longer.
Another boat I had kept filling up with water; it seemed to take on dozens of 
gallons in only an hour or two. When I took it out of the water to see why, 
I saw water squirting through a toothpick-sized screw hole on a fitting. I’d 
noticed the fitting was loose before I launched the boat, but I didn’t real-
ize it would turn into such a major leak when the boat was in the water. It 
appeared to be a hole, but it could have resulted in a fully swamped boat had 
I left it at the dock overnight.
Both situations were annoying and completely avoidable. I consider that a 
good lesson learned.
Check and tighten hose clamps
Your boat has hoses mostly to let liquid move around safely without flooding 
the boat. Some hoses are conduits for water and some are for fuel. Odds are 
if your boat is taking on water, a loose hose or damaged fitting is to blame.
If your boat is well built, every hose fitting through the hull of the boat has 
two stainless-steel hose clamps on it, compressing the hose to the fitting that 
goes through the hull. A through-hull fitting is a fancy pipe that goes through 
the hull and fastens tight on both sides of the fiberglass — a flange on the 
outside and a threaded nut on the inside. The hose clamps look just like the 
ones on the hoses under your car’s hood. On newer boats, the metal clamps 
seem to loosen a bit over time, and sometimes the hose on the fittings com-
presses over time, also loosening the clamp. You can easily tighten hose 
clamps with a screwdriver and stop the leak. It pays to poke your head in the 
bilge or anywhere else you’re apt to find hose fittings and test them for tight-
ness by putting a half-turn on them with a screwdriver.
 
Don’t white knuckle your screwdriver when you tighten a hose clamp or you 
risk breaking it. Instead, use about the same force you’d use to turn off an out-
side hose faucet on your house.
Any leak found between a hose and the fitting it’s clamped onto can usually 
be repaired simply by tightening the clamp. But if there’s much of a leak — 
say, a steady drip instead of an occasional drip — it’s a good idea to follow 
these steps:
 
1. Remove the hose and clamp.
 
2. Put a marine sealer on the fitting.

269
 Chapter 15: Repairing Leaks and Other Damage to Your Boat
 
 You can get a tube of sealant at any marine dealer. Keep it on your boat 
for unplanned fitting maintenance.
 
3. Slide the loosened clamp(s) up the hose before pushing the hose onto 
the fitting.
 
4. Tighten the clamp(s).
 
Through-hull fittings are pretty easy to find inside by just walking around your 
boat and noting any fittings on the outside. Then lift the hatches inside your 
boat nearest the outer end of the fitting. Figure 15-1 shows a through-hull fit-
ting not yet installed.
 
Figure 15-1: 
Check 
through-hull 
fittings peri-
odically to 
catch leaks 
before they 
become 
serious.
 
Your inboard or sterndrive engine will have hose clamps to maintain, too. 
With the exception of one in the back of the engine that you can’t easily 
access, the rest should be easy to spot and tighten using the same proce-
dures you use for through-hull fittings — just skip the sealant step. As a rule, 
you don’t need sealant on the engine hoses because the hoses are softer and 
easier to seal by tightening a clamp.
Tighten and repair hardware
Operating conditions for boats are rougher than most conditions for cars. 
The shock from waves is transmitted through the hull to every screw, hinge, 
and latch, and every brace, bracket, and bolt in the boat.
Things will loosen up over time, so here’s a list of what to look for and what 
to do. This isn’t an exhaustive list of dangling screws and other hardware, 
but it helps you know what to look for.

270
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
Hinges and latches
Hinges and latches on hatches need to be tightened periodically. When you 
find that the glove box or the anchor locker won’t stay latched, take a closer 
look to find out what’s loose or has worked out of alignment. Most of these 
mechanisms are so simple that you can see immediately what needs tight-
ened and whether you need to do it with a screwdriver or a wrench. If you 
skip this maintenance step, you may find the gadget is soon broken beyond 
reasonable repair.
Lift latches are common for securing boat hatches (see Figure 15-2). To 
open one, you pull up a ring from the floor and twist it. Underneath, the bolt 
rotates to release the hatch. Slamming the hatch shut when the bolt is in the 
latch position (instead of the release position) inevitably bends the bolt. To 
adjust it, you need a regular wrench and sometimes an Allen or hex wrench. 
Some lift latches have an Allen screw to lock in place the nut that secures the 
bolt. To adjust the bolt, loosen the Allen screw, and then unscrew the nut 
and bolt one or two turns to give it clearance to latch again. When the adjust-
ment is good, tighten the Allen screw to lock it in place.
 
Figure 15-2: 
A common 
lift latch 
on many 
boats can 
be adjusted 
with an 
Allen 
wrench 
and an 
adjustable 
wrench.
 
Brackets and braces
If you let a windshield bracket remain loose, hitting a large wave may be all 
it takes to cause the glass to flex and shatter, creating a much more difficult 
and expensive repair. Check brackets and braces on seats, windshields, and 
boarding ladders for solid connections. Wiggle the components with your 
hand and look for movement between connecting points. If you see move-
ment, tighten the screws and bolts.

271
 Chapter 15: Repairing Leaks and Other Damage to Your Boat
Ignition switch and running lights
Tighten the ignition switch in the dash. I’ve tested literally hundreds of boats, 
and I can’t count how many have ignition switches that slipped and turned 
in their mounting holes on the dashboards (salty boaters call them the helm 
stations), making them harder to use. Ignition switches have a large threaded 
fitting that goes through a matching hole in the dash. A nut threads onto the fit-
ting from behind the dash, and only the friction of being tight, tight, tight holds 
it in place. The minute you detect any slippage when you turn the key, get a 
wrench and tighten that nut under the dash. If you don’t, you could twist and 
break the ignition leads, requiring a more expensive and complicated repair.
 
Any time you work on electrical connections, make sure the battery switch is 
turned off — unless you need power to diagnose the condition of a specific 
circuit.
Running lights are always good candidates for examination. Pay particular 
attention to a white stern navigation light mounted on a long pole, if you have 
one. The leverage of the pole responding to the motion of the ocean (or any 
water body) can loosen the screws holding it in place.
Spotting and Fixing Loose 
or Damaged Belts
Serpentine belts snake from pulley to pulley on the front of your sterndrive 
or inboard engine in, well, a serpentine pattern.
What these belts do is use the energy of the engine to run an alternator, 
which charges your battery, and a water pump, which keeps cooling water 
running through the engine. Today’s belts last a long time — several years, 
sometimes — but when they wear out, they have a knack for doing it at an 
inconvenient time. A belt that goes out when your boat is in a strong river 
current or tide can even be dangerous.
 
You don’t need to fix a belt yourself. Just regularly examine the condition of 
your belts so you can get your boat to a mechanic before a belt fails, leaving 
you stranded or drifting off toward a movie-cliché waterfall.
Testing belt tension
The serpentine belt should be firmly tense when the engine isn’t running. 
You can test this just by pressing down on it between pulleys. It shouldn’t 
be rock hard, but if it sags more than about an inch when you press on it, it 

272
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
probably needs adjusting. A squeal from the engine can be another sign that 
the tension in the belt needs adjusting.
So, if the belt sags under pressure like a CPA at tax time or if it squeals like a 
pig, get it to your mechanic. If you don’t get it adjusted, the belt could fail and 
the engine could overheat and be damaged, requiring thousands of dollars in 
repairs.
Knowing when a belt needs changing
Your engine’s belt could also show other signs of wear. Cracks in the rubber 
mean it’s about to break. Have your mechanic change it before it does. Think 
about this: What if it broke in the St. Lawrence Seaway — say, right above 
Niagara Falls? If it did, you’d sure want to throw out a good anchor on a 
strong rope, and then holler mayday on the VHF radio for all you’re worth! 
(I discuss emergency situations in Chapter 12.)
Understanding Propeller 
Types and Repair
Most boat and motor manufacturers spend a great deal of time and effort 
testing every boat model and engine combination with many different pro-
peller types and dimensions to settle on the combination with optimum 
performance and price. If you want to upgrade to a better-performing prop 
(boat-speak for propeller), or if you have to replace a prop, getting the right 
propeller is as important to your boat’s good performance and your engine’s 
longevity as any other proper maintenance step. Even if a prop seems to fit 
onto your boat, if the prop’s dimensions are too big or too small, using it can 
damage the engine.
This section gives you some background information on boat propellers and 
tells you how to determine when your prop needs repair or replacement, 
when to do it yourself, and when to take it to a professional.
Getting propeller dimensions right
A prop’s main dimensions are pitch and diameter, and these measurements 
are listed somewhere on all props (although they may be corroded and 
impossible to spot on older props). For example, “15 x 21” means the prop 
has a 15-inch diameter and 21-inch pitch.

273
 Chapter 15: Repairing Leaks and Other Damage to Your Boat
 
✓ Pitch is the theoretical distance a prop would travel in one complete 
revolution, and it’s determined by the angle of the blades. Typically, a 
prop reaches only 80 or 90 percent of that distance.
 
✓ Diameter of the prop is twice the radius. You can measure the radius 
with a tape measure by placing it at the center of the prop and extending 
it over the blade tip.
 
A prop with the wrong dimensions can spoil your boat’s performance, cost 
excess fuel, and damage the engine.
More than one dimension can be acceptable for your motor, but keep in mind 
that different dimensions can offer different specific performance benefits. 
For instance, you may want your boat to accelerate very fast to pull a skier 
or wakeboard rider out of the water. If so, you want a shorter pitch prop that 
fits your engine. Or you may be most interested in going fast, not caring so 
much about acceleration. In that case, you need a longer pitch prop. Your 
boat manufacturer or dealer can help you with prop dimensions to replace a 
damaged prop or enhance performance of your boat by installing and testing 
props with different dimensions.
Having the right number of blades
Propellers come with two or more blades. Two-blade and five-blade props 
are rarely ever used. Three-blade props are most often used and give the 
best speed in most boats.
Four-blade props give better acceleration than two or three blades, and the 
extra blade surface tends to pull down on the prop, levering the bow out of 
the water for a softer ride. Four-blade propellers are best for boats with big 
loads, but the extra blade increases drag and reduces speed.
The only way to determine if you have the propeller and number of blades 
that works best for your boat and load is to find a prop dealer who will let 
you test different props. Many do that, charging a 10 or 15 percent restocking 
fee to change propellers until you find the one you like.
Knowing the differences in prop materials
Propellers are made of aluminum, stainless steel, or bronze.
Aluminum propellers
Most boats come standard with an aluminum prop. Correctly sized by the 
manufacturer, aluminum propellers offer a good combination of good perfor-
mance and value for a low price. However, aluminum propellers are softer 

274
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
and tend to be more severely damaged by collision than props made of other 
materials. Still, by breaking easily, they tend to absorb the force of collision 
rather than transfer it to the engine, where it can do more harm. More easily 
repaired than other metals, aluminum propellers are an ideal choice for shal-
low rocky waters where collisions are nearly unavoidable.
Stainless-steel propellers
Stainless steel is a hard metal that allows propellers to be cast with thinner 
blades and still have incredible strength. The thinner the blades, the less 
drag created as they pass through the water, so the stainless-steel prop gives 
a boat a big boost in speed and acceleration. Naturally, these props are also 
more expensive than other types.
Because of decreased drag, your boat may perform better with a longer-
pitch, stainless-steel propeller than an aluminum one. Here are characteris-
tics of stainless-steel props to keep in mind:
 
✓ Speed and efficiency are the hallmark of a good stainless-steel prop. 
A boat can gain several miles per hour in top speed with the correctly 
sized stainless-steel prop as opposed to an aluminum prop of equal 
dimensions.
 
✓ Stainless-steel props don’t break or bend easily. The durability gives you 
the ability to get home even if you strike an underwater object.
 
✓ Because of the unique characteristics of stainless steel, it doesn’t lend 
itself to do-it-yourself repair for minor prop damage.
 
✓ A stainless-steel prop is more likely to transfer damaging impact force 
directly to the gear case because the prop doesn’t give way. That can 
sometimes result in more expensive damage. So, in areas where striking 
rocky reefs is more normal than not, an aluminum prop may be a better 
choice.
Bronze propellers
Bronze props are rare except on inboard motors. Like aluminum, they’re 
softer and damage more easily than stainless steel, and their advantages and 
disadvantages are similar to those of aluminum (refer to the “Aluminum pro-
pellers” section).
Determining if your prop is damaged
Propellers don’t wear out, but they often need repair or replacement because 
of damage from collision or corrosion. Your first sign of propeller problems 
may be a vibration you feel throughout the boat. Or you may find that the 

275
 Chapter 15: Repairing Leaks and Other Damage to Your Boat
boat fails to accelerate as you accelerate the engine. If you tilt the propel-
ler out of the water by trimming the engine or outdrive all the way up (see 
Chapter 7 for more about trimming the engine), any damage is readily visible. 
If you trailer your boat, propeller inspection is easiest when the boat is on 
the trailer.
A damaged prop will show chips in the blades or even missing blades, 
depending on the severity of the impact that caused the damage. Less obvi-
ous to the eye is a bent blade. Running into something soft but large, like an 
underwater tree stump, can bend a blade without breaking it.
Sometimes a prop spins a hub. The hub is the center of the prop that slips 
over the shaft of the motor. A rubber or plastic bushing between the propel-
ler blades and the hub cushions the motor from impact damage. Impact can 
damage the hub, or the hub may just wear out from use. If your engine accel-
erates properly but your boat doesn’t accelerate with engine speed, chances 
are the damage is to the rubber or plastic bushing in the prop, which is easily 
replaced at a prop shop. Only a few props are made to allow you to change 
the hub. Most require special tools to do the job.
 
You may be tempted to ignore a piece of fishing line or nylon rope twisted 
around your prop, especially because it’s not apt to noticeably reduce 
performance — in the beginning, anyway. But check carefully for these foul-
ings and remove them immediately. If you don’t, the nylon fibers can cut into 
the rubber seals of your gear case, damaging them and allowing water to get 
into the gears, ultimately destroying them.
Removing the propeller 
to replace or repair it
If your propeller needs to be repaired or replaced, there’s a good chance the 
easiest way for you to get it done is to remove the prop yourself and take it to 
a shop. It’s not a hard job to do in most cases, and this section tells you how 
to go about it.
Removing outboard and sterndrive props
Most outboards and sterndrives manufactured in the past 30 years were built 
with a splined prop shaft. Splines are grooves that run the length of the shaft. 
Inside the propeller’s hub, matching splines fit against the shaft splines (see 
Figure 15-3). This arrangement lets the shaft turn the prop instead of just 
spinning inside it. Removing a prop from the shaft is easy, as is replacing it.

276
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
 
Figure 15-3: 
A typical 
propeller 
configura-
tion.
 
Here’s how to remove an outboard or sterndrive propeller:
 
1. Remove the cotter key.
 
 The cotter key is a wire pin that looks like a hairpin. It passes through a 
hole on the shaft and is held there by bending the ends of it back against 
the shaft. In most cases the cotter key fits through slots in the prop nut 
as well (for a description of the prop nut, see the next step). To remove 
the cotter key, you need to straighten the ends again with needle-nose 
pliers before you can pull it out.
 
2. Remove the prop nut.
 
 The prop nut is just what it sounds like, and it’s screwed onto the 
shaft and hand-tightened. You should be able to unscrew it by hand to 
remove it. (When replacing this nut, hand-tighten and then check to see 
if the cotter keyhole lines up with a slot in the nut. If not, unscrew the 
nut just enough to make the keyhole and nut slot line up.)
 
3. Remove the washer under the prop nut, next to the propeller.
 
4. Slide the prop off.
 
 If it sticks from corrosion, spray an aerosol lubricant on the hub and the 
end of the prop shaft and let it penetrate for a few minutes to loosen any 
corrosion between the shaft and prop.
 
5. If the prop proves stubborn to remove, place a block of wood against 
the hub and strike the block with a hammer.

277
 Chapter 15: Repairing Leaks and Other Damage to Your Boat
 
 Move the block to different blades until the prop loosens. When you’re 
ready to replace the prop, apply some silicone grease to the shaft and it 
probably won’t get stuck again.
Removing inboard props
Inboard props tend to stick to the shaft more than outboard props. Don’t ask 
me why, but they do. Some inboard shafts are splined, but older ones have 
a slot-and-key connection. For the latter, you’ll find a slot in the prop and a 
matching slot in the shaft.
To remove a slot-and-key prop, you follow essentially the same steps listed 
in the preceding section for removing outboard and sterndrive propellers. Be 
sure to save the key (a half moon-shaped piece of metal) between the shaft 
and prop, as you need it to replace the prop. The key keeps the shaft from 
spinning inside the prop.
Repairing different types of propellers
You can do only the most minor maintenance and repair to your propeller, 
such as filing off burrs and minor nicks. All else should be left to the pros in 
a prop shop because you can damage the prop by not using the proper tools. 
Nevertheless, you should get in the habit of inspecting your prop regularly 
for damage because sometimes damage will have occurred without your 
knowledge. For example, a bent or gouged blade can put your prop out of 
balance, making it wobble on the shaft. You can often feel that as vibration in 
the boat, and you should keep your ear and touch tuned for it.
 
A badly damaged prop isn’t useless. File it as smooth as possible using a fine 
metal file, and throw it in a ski locker to keep as a spare. If you have a prop 
mishap while boating and need a temporary replacement, you can usually tilt 
the propeller high enough out of the water to make an emergency swap to get 
you home.
Repairing aluminum props
Aluminum props aren’t as hard as stainless steel, but they are more brittle. 
Striking rocks or stumps is more likely to sheer off large chunks of metal or 
even one or more of the blades on an aluminum prop as opposed to a stain-
less-steel one.

278
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
Here are some considerations for maintaining and repairing aluminum props:
 
✓ Aluminum propellers with missing blades or with gouges in the blade 
of 1 inch or more should be replaced. A good propeller repair shop can 
rebuild blades with gouges smaller than 1 inch, but if all three blades are 
badly damaged, a replacement prop may be more economical. Ask the 
shop manager for cost estimates of all your options.
 
✓ Gouges or chips in the blade under 1/16 inch usually can be filed smooth 
on your work bench (if you have one), but if your boat is more high 
performance in nature, with horsepower exceeding 150, a professional 
repair will give a better result.
 
 To file small gouges yourself, use a fine metal file to file the edge of the 
blade down even with the deepest chip in the blade. Round the edges to 
make them free of snags and burrs.
Repairing stainless-steel props
Stainless-steel props can be repaired, but not usually by you. The hardness of 
the metal makes it difficult to hammer back into shape and file nicks smooth. 
The cost of a stainless-steel prop is in the neighborhood of $350 to $600, so 
the chance of doing more harm than good with a file or hammer and a do-it-
yourself attitude is amplified.
One thing you can do to maintain a stainless-steel prop is to file off small 
nicks and burrs on the blade. This seemingly minor damage can reduce prop 
efficiency. If a nick is under 1/32 inch in size, filing it smooth can be effective. 
The same goes for burrs that snag a cloth pulled lightly over the blades. 
Serious damage such as nicks more than 1/16 inch deep need professional 
repair.
To file off very small nicks and burrs, follow the filing instructions in the pre-
ceding section.
 
Bent stainless-steel blades are best left to the professionals. If you notice a 
slight bend in a blade, you can try to bend it back into shape — but be careful, 
because it’s easy to snap off the blade. If you don’t detect any vibration or loss 
of power, don’t worry about repairing a slightly bent blade until the end of the 
season.
I once hammered a bent stainless-steel blade tip back in place. It was a tri-
angle on the tip about 1/2 inch long and nearly 90 degrees out of whack. I bent 
it slowly with light taps over time. It worked, but I just as easily could have 
broken it off.

279
 Chapter 15: Repairing Leaks and Other Damage to Your Boat
Repairing bronze props
Professional maintenance is often more important for bronze props than 
for aluminum. Bronze is easy to file, so removing small nicks and burrs is 
easy with a fine metal file. But bronze props tend to run at higher speeds or 
revolutions per minute (RPMs), making a small imbalance in weight between 
blades a bigger problem than in other props. So, if you file off a small nick on 
one blade, that one blade may weigh slightly less than the others and cause 
the prop to spin out of balance. And an out-of-balance prop can vibrate and 
cause damage to the engine.
Handling Electrical Problems
Nine out of ten times, if you have a problem with your boat, it’s electrical. It 
may be as insignificant as hearing nothing from the left-rear stereo speaker or 
as critical as smelling hot wires and vinyl insulation burning. Shut off the bat-
tery switch if you catch a whiff of smoke.
In this section, I give you an overview of a boat’s electrical system and tell 
you how to track down and fix bad connections.
What do those colored wires mean?
Wires in boats are color-coded to make it easier to determine which one in 
the bird’s nest of wires goes to which thing onboard. Unsophisticated boat 
builders follow the beat of their own drummer, and the colors have little con-
sistent meaning. Better boat builders follow certain industry standards that 
are much like building codes in your town.
Throughout this book, I mention NMMA certification of boats. I mention 
it again here, because nothing on your new boat has more potential for 
problems than wiring. If your boat is NMMA-certified, the National Marine 
Manufacturers Association has inspected the manufacturer’s processes, 
including the wiring systems, and determined that they meet both the rudi-
mentary United States Coast Guard requirements and the more stringent 
standards of the American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC). The ABYC wiring 
standards cover 12-volt systems and, for cruising boats with onboard living 
facilities, 110-volt systems.
Part of the ABYC code requires certain colored wires for certain electrical 
functions onboard (for specifics on these wire colors, see Table 15-1). Should 
wiring issues crop up down the road — er, waterway — the color-coded 
wires will help you or your mechanic track down the problem more quickly, 
saving time and money. Wiring systems wired this way are safer for you and 
your crew, too.

 Chapter 15: Repairing Leaks and Other Damage to Your Boat
Working on a 12-volt battery system
Nearly all boats, their engines, and accessories run on a 12-volt battery 
system similar to what’s in your car. In a boat, though, you can have more 
than one battery.
Different battery setups for different boats
Each engine should have its own 12-volt starting battery that’s recharged by 
the engine’s alternator. Most freshwater boats and some saltwater fishing boats 
have a trolling motor powered by one to three 12-volt, deep-cycle batteries. Each 
one needs to be recharged with a battery charger at the end of the day.
Many boats have one or more house batteries to run the many electronics and 
accessories onboard. Often the house battery is charged by the engine(s). If 
not, it needs to be connected to a charger after use. Your dealer will explain 
your boat’s setup.
Cruisers and other boats with onboard living quarters have many house bat-
teries, depending on the size of the boat and projected power needs of the 
crew. Some of these batteries are recharged by the engines, some by a gen-
erator, and some by a charger when the boat is connected to power onshore 
(such a charger taps into shore power).
Battery connections are black and red
Power comes from the positive side of a battery, which is always marked 
with a “+” and is always connected to the red wires in your system. Power 
flows out from the red wires on the positive terminal and back to the battery 
through the black wires on the negative terminal.
 
Boats made very recently follow new standards that require the ground wire 
to be yellow. To ease the explanation in this chapter, though, I refer to the 
ground wire as black.
It’s impractical to take all the black and red wires to all the pumps, radios, 
lights, stereos, and GPS and depth finders in your boat’s aft (toward the back 
or stern) and back to the battery. So instead, a single black wire and a single 
red wire are taken to the helm station and fastened each to its own terminal 
block (see Figure 15-4) underneath what you’ll find yourself calling the dash-
board. A terminal block is a plastic plate with metal terminals and screws to 
hold the wires in place.

282
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
 
Figure 15-4:

positive 
terminal 
has many 
devices 
wired to 
it. Colors 
match 
the ABYC 
codes, and 
as a bonus, 
they’re 
labeled.
 
Each terminal block has a place to connect wires from several accessories. 
Using this system saves wire, eases the wiring job, reduces the risk of circuit 
failure, and optimizes power usage from the battery by eliminating long, 
power-sapping wire runs.
Resetting circuit breakers 
or replacing fuses
Occasionally, a stereo or pump malfunctions and overloads the circuit, thus 
overheating the wire. Overheating trips a circuit breaker (see Figure 15-5) or 
blows a fuse. Fewer boats today are built with fuses, but if you have one with 
fuses, the panel will look similar to the fuse panel in your car. (Sometimes 
fuses are contained in a holder on each individual wire, which isn’t the easi-
est setup to work with.)
 
Sometimes the circuit breaker trips or a fuse blows for no apparent reason. If 
resetting the breaker or replacing the fuse solves the problem, move on. If it 
happens repeatedly, you need to have a marine mechanic or electrician find 
out why the breaker keeps tripping or the fuse keeps blowing.
Resetting breakers and replacing fuses are pretty common tasks in the boat, 
just like in the home. Checking for loose connections takes only a little more 
initiative, and if you’re a little bit handy, doing it is worth your effort on 
12-volt systems.

Tampering with 110 volts is dangerous
If your boat has a sleeping berth and a microwave or a refrigerator, chances 
are it has wiring for 110-volt power. You may have a gasoline-powered or 
diesel-powered generator, and you’ll definitely have a place where you can 
connect 110-volt shore power while your boat is docked.
 
I suggest that you not tamper with the wiring in a 110-volt system unless 
you’re a certified marine electrician. Mistakes can be fatal! So if you have trou-
ble with your wiring, take your boat to the shop.
Tracking down electrical problems
Electricity is like the wind: Its effects can be felt, but it can’t be seen. In 
plumbing or tracking down a hull leak, it’s easy to see the leak. But when 
you’re dealing with a wiring problem, all you know is something doesn’t 
work. In tracking down a short circuit — say the stereo doesn’t work — 
you’re left to spot the effects of electricity and find where those effects end.
The following is a handy strategy for finding problems in wiring. I use the 
stereo as an example. Note: As each progressive step fails to restore the 
device to operation, move on to the next one.
 
1. If the stereo is turned off, turn it on.
 
 A stereo needs to be turned on at the stereo head unit and often at the 
accessory switch on the helm station (dashboard).

284
Part IV: Keeping Your Boat Shipshape 
 
2. If the battery is turned off, turn it on.
 
 Remember, you may have a battery switch that can be set to “Off.”
 
3. Make sure your battery is charged.
 
 If other things that rely on the battery, like the engine starter, work 
properly, you can eliminate the battery as a source of the problem. If 
other things that rely on the battery don’t work, charge the battery.
 
4. If the stereo circuit breaker is tripped and protruding from its socket, 
press it back in. If it trips again, or if it has a fuse that blows repeat-
edly, skip to Step 10.
 
5. Check the connections of the red and black wires on the positive and 
negative battery terminals for tight connections by wiggling them. If 
they seem loose or you see sparks, tighten the terminal connections 
with a wrench.
 
 Be careful not to accidentally touch the wrench to the red and black 
terminals when tightening the terminal connections, as that may cause 
sparks.
 
6. Look under the dashboard for the red positive wire that comes from 
the stereo, and make sure it’s tightly fastened to the stereo.
 
7. Look under the dashboard for the usually black negative stereo wire, 
and make sure it’s tightly fastened to the negative terminal block.
 
 If the negative wire doesn’t seem to be black, consult the owner’s 
manual of the stereo for the actual color. Remember, newer boats often 
have yellow ground wires, also called negative wires. You’re looking for 
the wire attached to the negative terminal block near the positive termi-
nal block.
 
8. If you haven’t solved the problem yet, see if other things connected to 
the same positive and negative terminal blocks function properly. If 
they don’t, check the terminal leads at the block and at the battery.
 
9. If none of the connections tested thus far seem faulty, it’s time to 
assume the stereo doesn’t work and replace it.
 
10. If a circuit breaker or a fuse repeatedly trips or blows, respectively, 
the stereo could be faulty. Your options are to replace it or visit your 
boat mechanic.
 
 You may want to see the mechanic first because he or she could find 
that the problem is elsewhere in the wiring, saving you an unnecessary 
stereo replacement.

Using some helpful wiring tools
The tools of marine wiring are pretty simple and inexpensive to acquire. In 
fact, you probably already have many of them. This list has the makings of a 
pretty good do-it-yourself kit (see Figure 15-6):
 
✓ A wire crimping and stripping tool lets you strip wire ends to accept 
connectors and also crimp on the connectors. In addition, this tool has a 
wire cutter in it. It’s the Swiss Army knife of wiring.
 
✓ Needle-nose pliers are helpful for fitting or gripping wires in tight places.
 
✓ Various wire connectors give you options for repairing systems and 
making them fit as well as possible.
 
✓ Zip ties are handy for bundling loose wires in a more organized manner 
or for holding wires along the path you want them to follow.
 
✓ Electrical tape can be handy for making a quick temporary repair to a 
bare wire, although it isn’t used on boats as much as you may think.
 
✓ Silicone spray lubricant is helpful to protect circuits from corrosion.

Finding a Safe Harbor 
for Your Boat
In This Chapter
▶ Covering your boat
▶ Keeping your boat in a wet slip
▶ Considering renting or owning dry-stack storage
▶ Opting for storage on a trailer
You have to keep your boat somewhere when you’re not using it. 
Fortunately, you have several options. Keeping your boat on a trailer in 
the backyard is perfectly fine if it’s properly protected. On the other hand, 
marina storage can add to the fun and camaraderie of boating — if you pick 
the right one. Marinas offer a variety of perks, and if you land in one that 
offers the right mix of practicality, cost, and social environment, sometimes 
just hangin’ out in port is all you need for a weekend boating fix.
Storage facilities and their costs are different in different regions, partly 
because boating customs differ. Climate also impacts marine facility options 
and their costs. For instance, in year-round boating regions like Florida or 
Southern California, costs may be higher than in seasonal spots in Michigan 
or Missouri.
I can’t predict where you’ll boat or what kind of marina facilities or residen-
tial laws impacting boat storage you’ll face, but I can help you know what 
questions to ask and how to sort through your options and weigh the costs 
and benefits to find boat storage that suits you best. So dig into this chapter, 
because I go over the costs and benefits of keeping your boat in a marina, 
dry-stacking it, and even keeping it at home on a trailer. I also give you some 
practical tips for keeping your boat safe and protected during storage.

Part V: Enjoying Your Boat 
First Things First: Make Sure 
You Have a Mooring Cover
Regardless of where you choose to store your boat, the first step is buying 
a good mooring cover for your boat if it didn’t come with one. Even if you 
keep your boat in an enclosed garage, you should still put a cover on it for 
protection — and of course, you have to move it outside sometime if you ever 
want to use it. Some boats have factory-made covers as options or even stan-
dard equipment, but many others don’t, leaving you with the task of getting 
one made to protect your boat. A good cover adds years to the beauty and 
enjoyment of your boat by protecting it from the elements.
When you keep your boat around water, it becomes a roosting magnet for 
waterfowl and other birds — and you know what they leave behind. Even 
in a relatively bird-free area, exposure to the sun is destructive; it gradually 
breaks down the ultraviolet-light barriers built into fabrics and vinyls, yel-
lows the wax, and fades the fiberglass. Your boat’s mooring cover should 
have these characteristics:
 
✓ Waterproofing: Waterproof fabric is essential. Whether you’re storing 
your boat in the water or on dry land, you want to prevent rainwater 
from filling your bilge, which could wear down your battery by continu-
ally activating the bilge pump as water levels rise. (Most boats have an 
automatic bilge pump that senses a rising water level and starts pump-
ing when it reaches a predetermined depth.)
 
 Even with a waterproof mooring cover, if there’s not enough slant to 
your boat’s cover to shed water, you’ll need to somehow prop it up in 
the middle for water to run off.
 
✓ UV protection: Fabrics protected from ultraviolet (UV) light are neces-
sary because fabrics won’t last long under the sun (almost) 24/7 unless 
they have UV inhibitors. UV-protected fabrics are more fade resistant, 
too. The most popular fabric for boat canvas is called Sunbrella (www.
sunbrella.com/na/en/marine.pl). It’s known for its ability to shed 
water and resist the effects of UV light.
 
 Dark-colored sides on a boat are more vulnerable to UV light than lighter 
colored sides. If you have dark hull colors, protect that finish by having 
your cover designed to reach down beyond the color band.
 
✓ A snug fit: A proper fit is required to keep the cover weather-tight. 
Loose covers collect puddles on top, which eventually become enor-
mous pots of water that stretch the cover and can even tear it by pulling 
it against structures of the boat.

291
 Chapter 16: Finding a Safe Harbor for Your Boat
 
✓ An easy-to-install design: If you store your boat on the water, the 
design of the cover should make it easy to install it from inside the boat, 
because you may not be able to reach all around the boat from the dock. 
Practical covers snap over the bow, the windshield, and the cockpit and 
usually end right at the edge of the deck. Such a cover should install 
easily from bow to stern, allowing you to retreat toward the dock as you 
snap it in place.
 
I find the hardest part of putting a cover on a boat is figuring out which side 
of the cover is the starboard (right) side and which is the port (left) side as I 
unroll it from the bundle. On my cover, I changed the tie-down ropes to help 
me out; I used green ropes on the starboard side to match the green naviga-
tion light on the starboard side. If you have a snap-on cover, you could use a 
little dab of green paint on the starboard snaps. That little trick saved me a lot 
of sweat and wrestling around with my cover.
Floating Your Boat in Wet Slip Storage
Ever hear the song “Sitting on the Dock of the Bay”? The easygoing, romantic 
atmosphere brought to mind by that song is often the first thought of new 
boaters as they imagine themselves immersed in their sport. The mind’s eye 
pictures the boat gently tugging at its docklines as the sunset breeze pushes 
away the sun’s sweltering heat. Dew drips from your tall glass of iced tea, and 
your favorite song is setting the tone over your stereo. . . . That can be real-
ity, but dockside life isn’t always as great as it’s cracked up to be.
In fact, when you finish reading this section about the costs, pros and cons, 
and necessary preparations for wet slip storage (see Figure 16-1), you may 
decide it’s not for you at all! Of all your storage options, this is the most expen-
sive when you consider both the cost of the slip rental and the additional main-
tenance required when you leave your boat in the water all the time.
Getting what you want from a wet slip
Just any slip may seem fine until you actually begin to use it with your boat. 
You’ll quickly discover some things you like and some things you really hate 
about it. This section has some insight on what to look for with regards to 
convenience and usability for your boat’s proposed wet slip home.
Easy docking access
Easy docking access in a wet slip may be the most important thing to con-
sider for a new boater. Docking will be daunting if you get stuck with the last 
slip wedged in near the shore between two giant boats, with several more 
boats on the next dock looming over your path to your slip.

If you choose to go with a wet slip, try to select a slip with the following 
characteristics:
 
✓ An easy approach: You want an entrance that’s as straightforward as 
possible. Also look for the following:
 
• A slip that isn’t crowded between other boats.
 
• A slip that doesn’t require you to make a hard right or left turn to 
enter your slip.
 
• A slip that doesn’t have a strong current sweeping through it, 
either from the front or the side. Managing current while you dock 
is a tough battle to fight even for an experienced boater.
 
✓ Easy boarding access: Try to strike a balance between convenient 
access to the boat from the parking lot and to the open water once 
you’re in the boat. Here are some boarding considerations:
 
• Sometimes being closest to the parking lot is ideal. You’ll fre-
quently have tons of gear to take to the dock, and the farther you 
are from the parking lot, the longer and harder the haul.
 
• Some boaters prefer an open-water feeling, with their boats 
moored only a hop, skip, and a jump from getting underway. If you 
choose a slip close to the open water, just be sure that the outer 
edges of the marina are adequately protected from seas and boat 
chop with sea walls or other wave-breaking devices.

293
 Chapter 16: Finding a Safe Harbor for Your Boat
 
• Climbing aboard the boat easily may be your priority. Floating 
docks offer the easiest access to boats — most of the time. When 
the water rises or falls because of seasons, rain, or tides, the boat 
goes right along with it, keeping the step from dock to boat con-
sistent. Fixed docks built on pilings work out okay when the tides 
and other water fluctuations aren’t too dramatic. Ask your marine 
operator (often called the harbormaster) what kind of water fluc-
tuations to expect.
 
When mooring a boat on a dock built on pilings driven in the bottom, make 
sure you allow for water level changes. Naturally, coastal waters have tides, 
but some inland waters change with rain or when water is diverted for 
hydroelectric power. You need to leave enough slack to allow for water level 
changes, or your moorings (rope) might break as the boat drops down on the 
tide. Worse, I’ve seen boats held up by one or two lines on one side while the 
other side went down and under the water. Check with your harbormaster 
about water-level fluctuations and tides, and ask for advice on how best to 
allow for the changing water level given that your slip is in a dock on pilings.
Dockside amenities
When your boat is comfortably settled in a wet slip, you’ll find you need ame-
nities to support it, like electricity for battery charging, water for washing the 
boat, and a place to store your stuff. Here’s the lowdown on such dockside 
amenities and what you’re likely to need:
 
✓ Shorepower station: Shorepower is an electrical connection for boats 
that are equipped for it. Even some larger runabouts and a few pontoon 
boats have refrigerators, microwaves, blenders, and coffee makers that 
can operate on either 12-volt or 110-volt power. Shorepower is the most 
practical way to run these sorts of appliances while you’re in port.
 
✓ Connection for a battery charger: Even if you don’t need shorepower, 
you’ll eventually need a battery charger. That makes at least a 110-volt 
electrical connection essential dockside.
 
✓ Freshwater access: Many runabouts and pontoons (as well as small 
cruisers) are equipped with freshwater tanks from which to draw for 
drinking water and showers. To fill the freshwater tanks — and wash 
your boat at the dock now and then — a dockside hose connection is a 
must.
 
✓ Dockside storage: You may have some items that you want to keep 
handy for the boat but not actually in it at all times. You need conve-
nient storage for extra life jackets, tools, or a battery charger. If your slip 
doesn’t come with a dockside locker, find out if you’re allowed to install 
one. (You can get them from marine retailers.)

Preparing your boat for wet slip storage
If you plan to store your boat in the water, you need to do some things to 
make sure the boat can handle exposure to the weather, water, aquatic 
marine growth, and even wildlife, such as birds. This section highlights prep-
arations to make.
Anti-fouling paint for your bottom
I mean your boat’s bottom. Anti-fouling paint, often just called bottom paint, 
keeps algae, mollusks, and barnacles from growing on your hull. If you keep 
your boat in the water for long periods of time, marine growth collects 
quickly, adding fuel-robbing hull drag and even damaging the nice finish. No 
matter how much you clean it, once a hull has suffered the indignity of barna-
cles, algae, and calcium deposits, the finish will never have the same luster.
 
Unfortunately, there’s one thing bottom paint can’t prevent on boats that sit 
in the water: blisters. Gelcoat, the glossy white finish on your hull, is porous, 
so it absorbs water. Sometimes the gelcoat absorbs so much water that blis-
ters appear — even on hulls carefully protected with anti-fouling paint. Most 
water-stored boats get at least a few blisters, and many get a lot. Repairing 
these blisters adds another expense to your maintenance regimen. For some 
boaters, this kind of marine fouling is the deal breaker that swings them over 
to dry storage, which I discuss later in this chapter, in the section “Stacking 
the Deck for Dry Storage.”
Choose the right anti-fouling paint for your region. Appropriate paints differ 
by region because different marine life grows in different climates — and at 
different rates. Colder areas have different challenges than warmer areas. 
Confer with your marine serviceperson about the local flora and fauna. Ask 
what organisms are unique to your area and what paints do the best job of 
killing them or preventing them from getting a grip on your hull.
 
If you know from the day you select your boat that you plan to keep it in a slip, 
contract with the sales dealer to paint the bottom prior to taking delivery. 
Then your first paint job is behind you from the beginning!
Painting the bottom yourself
Do-it-yourself types frequently paint their own boat bottoms, but it isn’t 
something you should do without considerable research. Unless you prop-
erly prepare the hull, the paint won’t adhere to it and your effort will be 
wasted — along with hundreds of dollars of paint. Here are a few additional 
considerations:
 
✓ Figure out where to paint. Some marine operators won’t let you paint 
in their marinas due partly to concern about environmental issues and 
partly to concern of paint getting on neighboring boats. Your harbor-
master should be able to direct you to a marina where you can paint.

295
 Chapter 16: Finding a Safe Harbor for Your Boat
 
✓ Fume-proof yourself. If you paint your own boat bottom, safety precau-
tions are necessary to protect yourself from fumes and chemicals in the 
paint. Anti-fouling paint contains biocides, poisons that kill plant and 
animal growth. As you may imagine, these biocides are also poisonous 
to humans. Wear protective clothing, goggles, a respirator, and any 
other safety gear recommended on the label of your paint.
 
✓ Keep it green. Not the paint, the environment. You can use any color 
of paint you want, but remember that the paint is poisonous, and it’s 
important you get it only on the boat, not on the ground, on you, or on 
any wildlife. Anti-fouling paints have special directions about environ-
mental concerns, and it’s important you follow them.
Watching out for galvanic corrosion
When you keep your boat in the water, you must protect it against another 
risk that you can’t see: galvanic corrosion.
In a marina, many boats with different power systems put varying degrees 
of very low electrical current into the water. As these currents pass by 
your boat, they leech metal from the part of your boat’s propulsion system 
exposed to the water, especially the gear-case housing to which the propel-
ler is attached. Also at risk are the trim tabs (if you have them), the metal 
through-hull fittings, and any other metal parts exposed to the water. The 
resulting damage is caused galvanic corrosion.
Here’s the rundown on how to protect your boat from galvanic corrosion:
 
✓ Bottom paint is pretty low on the protection scale, but it does afford 
some protection. Boaters who use aluminum boats, like pontoons, in 
the sea find that bottom paint does a good job of warding off the worst 
corrosion.
 
✓ Zincs are small metal parts that are usually factory-installed on your 
boat and engine parts exposed to the water. Zincs dissolve more quickly 
than aluminum, bronze, and other metals on your boat, and they serve 
as sort of a lightning rod for your boat, drawing the current and its 
effects to themselves. The zincs dissolve, sacrificing themselves to pro-
tect other metals — that’s why they’re often called sacrificial anodes.
 
 It’s essential that you inspect zinc anodes regularly to monitor the level of 
corrosion and replace them when they lose half of their original surface 
area or are at risk of coming unfastened due to corrosion. Purchase new 
zincs from your local marine dealer or online at www.westmarine.com.
 
✓ Galvanic isolators are optional systems you have to have installed 
in your own boat. This gadget puts out a protective charge around 
your boat, warding off the effects of harmful stray currents from other 
sources in the marina and minimizing galvanic corrosion. Galvanic isola-
tors need to be professionally installed, so contact your service techni-
cian for advice.

296
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat 
Another alternative: Hoisting your boat
If you’re a lucky owner of a cabin at the lake or bungalow by the sea and you 
have a dock, hoisting your boat in the dock is a great idea. It’s a really handy 
compromise between keeping your boat in the water and keeping it in dry 
storage on a rack or on the trailer, as I discuss later in this chapter.
Boat hoists fit into wet slips, submerged in the water. After you’ve driven 
your boat over a hoist, you raise it up, lifting your boat high and dry. Hoists 
afford complete protection against galvanic corrosion, eliminate the need for 
bottom paint, and minimize the risk of sinking or damage from boat wakes or 
wind chop. Most marinas allow tenants to install hoists, but make sure you’re 
allowed to uninstall it if you move your boat elsewhere.
 
A hoist can eventually pay for itself by saving you money on the maintenance 
needed when you keep your boat down in the water.
Hoists come in several designs for various conditions. Here’s a quick refer-
ence list:
 
✓ Floating hoists are made of molded polyethylene. Marine growth forms 
on the bottom of this hoist, but the hoist is unharmed by it.
 
• How it works: This hoist remains floating, and you load your 
boat onto it by nudging the bow against the hoist’s loading tracks 
or rollers and adding throttle until the boat has enough power 
to climb onto the hoist. Usually boats are easily pushed off this 
hoist by one or two boaters, but sometimes a winch is needed to 
relaunch the boat.
 
• Advantages: The boat is held high and dry, safe from drifting 
debris, galvanic corrosion, and marine growth. A floating hoist is 
impervious to salt and galvanic corrosion.
 
• Reliability: Few working parts means there’s little to break.
 
• Application: Best for boats under 25 feet in length.
 
• Disadvantages: Polyethylene is affected by UV rays, and a floating 
hoist can degrade over time from sun exposure.
 
✓ Displacement hoists are made of galvanized steel, which is sturdy but 
doesn’t hold up well to saltwater exposure, making them best suited to 
freshwater slips.
 
• How it works: This style of hoist has tanks and an air pump. To 
load your boat on the hoist, you drive in so that your boat is posi-
tioned above the hoist, close the valves on the tanks, and turn on 
the pump to force air into the tanks and displace the water so they 
float, raising the boat. To launch the boat, you open a valve and 
allow the air to leave the tanks, which in turn allows the tanks to 
flood and sink, lowering the boat.

297
 Chapter 16: Finding a Safe Harbor for Your Boat
 
• Advantages: The boat is held high and dry, and you don’t have to 
power onto the hoist — you just drive into the slip normally.
 
• Reliability: These hoists are sturdy in the face of chop.
 
• Application: Best for freshwater slips. I’ve seen them used for 
boats up to 45 feet in length.
 
• Disadvantages: Corrosion can take its toll on a displacement hoist, 
and the electric pump can be affected by moisture from humidity 
or rain.
 
✓ Electric hoists use powerful electric winches, cables, and pulleys to 
raise and lower an aluminum or galvanized cradle for your boat.
 
• How it works: Winches are set on two of a set of four pilings. 
Cables are fastened to a cradle, which is suspended on the cables 
between the pilings. When the cradle is lowered into the water, 
you can drive your boat into it, step out, and activate the winches 
to raise the boat.
 
• Advantages: None of the hardware of a winch hoist remains under 
water for long, so it doesn’t collect marine growth or suffer from 
saltwater or galvanic corrosion.
 
• Reliability: It’s as reliable as your electricity!
 
• Application: Best for shallow water where dock pilings are practi-
cal and water levels fluctuate less than 5 feet, and for boats up to 
45 feet in length.
 
• Disadvantages: These hoists are dependent on electricity for 
launching your boat and aren’t as convenient as other hoists when 
it comes to entering your boat while it’s hoisted.
 
Carpeted bunks on hoists (and trailers) hold water, and if it’s salty, it can’t be 
rinsed away while a boat is sitting on it. That’s no big deal for fiberglass boats, 
but if aluminum pontoons sit on these salty bunks, corrosion can quickly eat 
through the metal. When hoisting metal boats from salt water, use plastic 
bunk guards instead of carpet.
The cha-ching factor of wet slip storage
Wet slip storage for your boat may be the most romantically appealing 
thanks to the easy escape you can make by just starting the engine and unty-
ing the lines. But add to the liabilities and complications the costs I itemize 
for you in this section, and you’ll see there’s quite a price for romancing the 
seas from a wet slip.

298
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat 
 
✓ Renting slips by the foot is modus boaterandii for slip fees. Boat slips 
are usually rented by the length of the boat they can accommodate, not 
by the length of your boat. So if you have a 20-foot boat and the only 
slip available in town is for a 25-foot boat, guess how many feet you’ll be 
paying for? Monthly rental fees for slips range in price from location to 
location.
 
✓ Water and electricity may or may not be included in your fees, so 
inquire about those amenities. (If you don’t think you’ll need them, refer 
to the earlier section, “Dockside amenities.”)
 
✓ Your contract with the marina may impose minimum insurance levels 
for your boat. Boats can catch fire or slip their moorings — which is 
a boaty way of saying “come untied” — and bump into other boats, 
making you liable for damages. For these reasons, marina operators can 
require you to provide proof of certain insurance coverage.
 
✓ Fuel on the water costs more than fuel on the highway. If you have a 
trailerable boat, filling up a 100-gallon tank on the highway can save you 
$50 to $100 or more over the cost of buying gas at a marina.
 
✓ Marinas may prevent you from servicing your own boat or bringing in 
your own mechanic to service your boat. Such marinas provide all boat 
services and repairs themselves — and the rates may be less than 
competitive.
Weighing the pros and cons 
of floating your boat
If you’re still deciding whether wet slip boat storage is right for you, here’s a 
quick reference on the pros and cons of slipping your boat:
 
✓ Pro: A boat in a slip makes for a fun and convenient getaway because 
there’s no major launching, no trailering, and no waiting for the dry-
stack forklift to drop the boat in the water. Crank the engine, cast off the 
docklines, and hit the high seas — or inland waterways.
 
✓ Pro: It’s romantic and pleasant. There’s an entire community feeling to 
a wet slip marina that offers a pleasant lifestyle experience with fellow 
boaters, and I’ve never found experiences like it anywhere else.
 
✓ Con: Not only are monthly fees expensive, but storing your boat dock-
side dramatically increases maintenance costs for your boat. Taking 
care that corrosion doesn’t compromise the engine and through-hull 
fittings and keeping the anti-fouling paint in good shape are expensive 
tasks.

299
 Chapter 16: Finding a Safe Harbor for Your Boat
Stacking the Deck for Dry Storage
Many people don’t boat because of the inconvenience of trailering and the 
expense and maintenance of keeping a boat in a slip. How much easier would 
it be if you could treat your boat like a tennis racket — put it on the shelf 
when you’re done playing and pick it up next time the urge to smash a few 
balls strikes? That’s what dry storage does for your boat — except someone 
else picks it up, washes it, and puts it away for you (like your mother, only he 
or she won’t scold you!).
Usually located at a marina, dry-stack storage — also called racks or just dry 
stacks — looks like a steel I-beam structure with boats nested in it like swal-
lows under a barn roof (see Figure 16-2). Some dry stacks are fully enclosed 
like gargantuan barns, so your boat is completely protected from normal 
weather. If you’re in a hurricane zone, the newer dry stacks are built to 
stricter standards so they can stand up to all but the most destructive hurri-
canes. You’ve probably seen one of these structures along a highway in your 
travels near a lake and thought little of it — except to wonder how they got a 
boat 40 feet in the air. (Hint: It involves a forklift.)

Part V: Enjoying Your Boat 
Dry-stack storage may just be the most convenient storage method, but it 
still has its ups and downs (pardon the dry humor). In this section, I spell out 
these considerations and give you an idea of what you should expect to get 
for your money from a dry-stack storage service.
What you can expect from 
dry-stack storage
When you dry stack your boat, it rests as many as 40 feet overhead. The 
marina operator uses an enormous forklift to lift your boat from the water 
and set it high in its cradle on the rack — unless you get one of the lower 
racks, which is just fine. Whenever you want your boat, you call the marina 
and someone fires up the forklift to lift it down and have it waiting for you at 
the marina’s dock. Dry-stack storage marinas have varying fees and services. 
Here are the most popular and useful amenities:
 
✓ Some marinas can forklift a boat as big as a 50-foot cruiser. Dry stacks 
with that capacity are more and more prevalent, increasing the options 
and convenience for cruising boaters. But many (if not most) marinas 
have a much smaller length limit. Check to see how big a boat your 
marina can hoist.
 
✓ Covered or uncovered dry-stack storage is a choice to consider. Some 
marinas offer both at varying costs. You can imagine the benefits of 
covered storage: protection from sun damage, rain, weather, and wild-
life (although sparrows and swallows have a knack for finding their way 
inside, making individual boat covers important even in covered stor-
age). For uncovered storage, you have to make certain your cover is 
supported and fastened in place firmly enough that water won’t pool in 
it. In either kind of dry stack, it pays to visit your boat to check its condi-
tion and use it at least once during storage to exercise it and clean it.
 
✓ Weekends are usually the busiest time to launch your boat, so you 
should call a few days before your planned boating outing to ask the 
marina to pencil you into their dry-stack launching list. Tell them when 
you expect to arrive, and call again when you depart for the marina 
to remind them you’re on the way. Chances are your boat could be 
launched just as you pull in the marina entrance.
 
✓ Weekday launching is often easier to do on the spur of the moment. It’s 
not unusual for a boater to call 15 minutes before noon and find his or 
her boat ready for a noon picnic.
 
✓ Many marinas have no limitations on how many times you can launch 
your boat in a month. A few have a specified number of launchings in a 
month and charge a fee for additional launchings over the limit. Some 
limit you to one launch and load per day and charge extra for additional 
ones.

301
 Chapter 16: Finding a Safe Harbor for Your Boat
 
✓ Courtesy docks make it convenient for you to land the boat and leave it 
for a few hours while you enjoy dinner out or some waterside shopping. 
Some marinas are short on that amenity, but others are better prepared 
to let you take a break.
 
✓ I’ve checked into several marinas in my area, and a surprising number of 
them will wash a boat down and flush the engine for no extra fee before 
stacking it. (When boating in salt water, you always need to flush the 
engine before putting the boat in storage.) All you have to do is leave the 
keys with the marina operator and get out of the way.
Preparing your boat for dry storage
There’s very little you have to do to prepare your boat for dry storage — 
that’s the beauty of it. You don’t have to bottom-paint your hull, buy and 
handle a boat trailer, or worry about galvanic corrosion, and most in-water 
risks just aren’t a problem when you dry stack your boat. But there are a 
few things you or your marine operator will need to do to secure your boat 
for safe storage. Sorting out who will do what will take some coordination 
between you and the dock hands.
To make it easy to get a routine going, discuss the following issues about 
storing your boat with the dock crew to determine who’s in the best position 
to handle them and when to perform the tasks:
 
✓ Fuel it up. It may seem weird to worry about fuel when you’re done 
boating for the day, but filling the tank prevents damage to the fuel, 
the fuel system, and the engine from water condensation that can form 
inside a partially empty tank. And it makes your future return to the boat 
turnkey simple.
 
✓ Stow away any loose items. If for some reason you don’t plan to cover 
the boat with its own cover, at least roll up the carpet and any snap-on 
cushions and stow them in a compartment. Even if you do cover your 
boat, it’s best to stow any loose items in a compartment.
 
✓ If you cover your boat, leave all storage hatches open. You want a little 
air circulating under the cover to prevent mildew and promote faster 
evaporation of dampness.
 
✓ Wash the boat to rinse out sand and grit, and wipe off water droplets. 
If you forget to dry the boat, water spots can form calcium deposits that 
are not only hard to remove but sometimes actually mar the gloss of 
your boat’s finish.
 
✓ Flush the engines if you’ve been boating in salt water. Because you’ll 
likely be gone by the time the boat is hoisted, the dock crew should be 
responsible for this step.

302
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat 
 
✓ Turn the battery switch to “Off” so the battery remains fresh for your 
return. Discuss this with your marina operator. Someone may need to 
drive the boat to the forklift pickup, so you want to remind the operator 
that you’d like the battery turned off before the boat is hoisted.
 
✓ Remove the drain plug so moisture can drain fully. Your dock crew 
should definitely be responsible for this step.
Racking up the costs of stacking your boat
In some regions, dry-stack boat storage is inexpensive enough to approach 
the low cost of trailering your boat, especially if you take into consideration 
the excess fuel burned when pulling a full tow load. Even if dry storage costs 
more, the ease of having a home port where the hard part of boating is han-
dled for you makes the storage fee pretty nominal.
 
Sizing up the costs and services of dry storage isn’t too tough if you’re willing 
to make a few phone calls. Here are some questions to ask regarding costs:
 
✓ What’s the cost of rack storage? Like wet slips, rack storage is charged 
per foot of boat length the space can accommodate. The cost per foot of 
rack storage is 50 to 70 percent less than wet slip storage.
 
✓ Is there a limit on how many times you can launch your boat, per day 
or per month? If a limit exists, find out the charge for extra trips.
 
✓ Is there an added charge for washing your boat and flushing the 
engines? It’s not hard to wash and flush your own boat, but saltwater 
flushing requires the boat to be out of the water. Some marinas charge 
extra for this service.
 
✓ Does the marina have a battery booster, and is there a charge to use 
it? Jump-starting your boat is something you’ll face if you leave some-
thing turned on while the boat’s in storage.
 
✓ Are there any specific insurance requirements that you must meet to 
stack your boat?
Weighing the pros and cons of racking up
You may detect a slight bias on my part toward dry-stack boat storage — 
and you would be right. Whether you live in a cold climate or tropical one, 
I think dry storage is far and away the best way to go for boaters who don’t 
have their own home docks or who have to trailer their boats from home to 
distant waters. But I’ll admit that I keep my boat on a trailer because I like 
it handy and close to home so I can add a little gadget, change a bad stereo 
speaker, or put in a new satellite radio receiver myself.

303
 Chapter 16: Finding a Safe Harbor for Your Boat
Storing a boat in a dry-stack cradle has its share of pros and cons.
 
✓ Pro: You’ll never have to launch or load or tow your boat. All you have 
to do is enjoy handling it.
 
✓ Pro: If you’re not tied to certain mechanics through a warranty, using 
the marina’s mechanics because you’re required to may be perfectly 
Evaluating marina amenities
Part of the fun of boating from any marina is the 
marina. Whether you want a dry-stack slot for 
your boat or a wet slip, you should take a much 
broader look at your proposed home marina 
beyond just the slips and electrical connections.
Some of the things you should expect from 
a marina are security, convenient parking, 
and clean restrooms with private showers. 
Following is an explanation of day-to-day ser-
vices and conveniences like these and others 
that can make your marina experience more 
pleasurable:
 ✓ Security: A marina should provide video and 
live-personnel security for your boat 24/7. 
Thieves know how easy it is to heist $1,000 
worth of stereo equipment or $10,000 worth 
of navigation electronics from any boat. It’s 
less convenient for them to hit a boat in a 
dry stack, but if your boat’s in a wet slip, 
they can easily sneak into the marina from 
the water, hotwire the boat, and drive it 
away. Boats don’t have the same secure 
ignition systems and locks as automobiles.
 ✓ Parking: Parking your land vehicle at your 
busy marina can become a problem on 
weekends. Make sure you know where to 
park and that there are plenty of spaces. 
Some marinas offer reserved parking at 
an additional fee of hundreds of dollars a 
season.
 ✓ Sewage pump-out station: Even boats as 
small as 20 feet can have toilets on them. 
They’re a great convenience on the water 
but a big inconvenience when they need to 
be emptied. Make sure sanitary pump-out 
services are available conveniently and at 
a reasonable charge.
 ✓ Ships’ store: Many marinas have found that 
a small convenience-style grocery store is 
a handy and profitable addition to a boat 
parts and accessories store. In addition to 
selling supplies like ice, soda, and snacks, 
such stores often offer concierge services 
you can arrange in advance for little or no 
charge — they’ll make sure your boat’s 
cooler is stocked before you even get to 
the marina!
 ✓ Restaurants: On-premise restaurants add 
to the convenience and community feel of a 
marina. It’s pretty nice to be able to stop off 
at the grill for bacon and eggs or a carryout 
egg sandwich in the morning. It’s a good 
time and place to chat with the local boat-
ers and find out what fish are biting, where 
the water cops are hangin’ out, and where 
the boaters are rafting up this weekend.
 ✓ Shore-side bathrooms and showers: Most 
marinas have private restrooms and show-
ers for marina guests. Even boaters with full 
heads on their boats (that means a toilet, 
shower, and sink) use the shore-side facili-
ties when possible so they can go longer 
between sewage holding-tank pump-outs 
and because the shore-side facilities 
are larger and easier to use. Make sure 
the marina you choose keeps them well 
maintained.

304
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat 
fine. You may be very happy with the marina’s marine mechanics, and 
they’ll be very handy to your boat whenever it needs attention.
 
✓ Con: You can’t access your boat in a rack. So performing simple mainte-
nance requires bringing it down from the rack and putting it in a cradle 
on the ground, for which there’s often a charge. If your son or daughter 
left a favorite toy in the boat, it’s likely going to stay there until you have 
the boat brought down next time.
 
✓ Con: You may be restricted to using the marina’s mechanics. Even if you 
have a boat that’s still under warranty but not bought from the marina’s 
store, the marina operator probably won’t allow the other dealer’s 
mechanic to work on your boat on marina property. The logistics of 
moving the boat to the required mechanic can complicate minor and 
major repairs — unless you already have a trailer.
Buying into Convenient Moorings
The priciest of all the boat storage options may be worth it, if you can afford 
the bill. Rackominiums and dockominiums have cropped up in popular marine 
communities, and they’ve been very popular. Haven’t heard those terms? 
I assume you’ve heard of an apartment complex going condo, forcing the 
tenants to buy or move. Many marinas are being redeveloped in a similar 
manner. Their superior amenities and ownership benefits — such as predict-
able service costs, yacht club atmosphere, and extremely clean and modern 
facilities — make them sell briskly in spite of the often-shocking price tags.
Sizing up the ’minium craze
Most of these new operations offer both wet slips and dry-stack racks for 
sale. In the many places where these operations have established them-
selves, individual slips or racks have generally increased in value, making 
them a potentially worthwhile investment.
Rackominiums
The term pretty much says what rackominiums are. Individual racks in a dry-
stack building are given fee-simple titles that can be insured and transferred 
from individual to individual. Your boat is always stacked in its own little 
place, and if you ever want to trade up or sell out, the rack is a saleable piece 
of real estate in the same way a condominium is.
Dockominiums
Waterfront property that seemed outrageously priced ten years ago is astro-
nomically higher today. Some owners of large yacht slips have reported sales 

305
 Chapter 16: Finding a Safe Harbor for Your Boat
prices of more than $1 million in popular urban boating regions. Just like a 
condo or racko, you get a title to your slip and you own it. And like I said, the 
dockos seem to increase in value.
Enjoying premium marina amenities
One of the greatest advantages to dockominums and rackominiums is the 
atmosphere and amenities. Like private clubs, these marina properties are 
well maintained and nicely landscaped. Amenities often exceed the number 
of those found in rental operations. Here are some of the top selling points of 
rackominiums and dockominiums:
 
✓ Privacy: These clubs are open only to owners, so everyone you’ll meet 
has a stake in keeping the facilities clean and pleasant. It’s one of the 
reasons they stay so well maintained.
 
✓ Pools: Many racko or docko properties have pools, giving you a great 
place to hang out when you want to be by the water but perhaps the 
water is too choppy to enjoy your boat.
 
✓ Restaurants and shops: Fine dining and snack bars — along with ship’s 
store, grocery, and dockside concierge service to supply your galley or 
cooler — make the experience convenient and pleasant.
 
✓ Fuel, service, and washing: Exemplary services are reported in many 
dockominium operations, making your boating literally turnkey. 
Schedule a launching; request fuel, ice, and sodas; and stroke one check 
for the service at the end of the month. Launching is free, along with 
washing the boat and flushing the engines.
Using a Trailer for More 
Freedom and Frugality
While many boaters use marina-based storage options, many others don’t, 
either because they don’t like the cost or because marinas aren’t convenient 
to the places where they most commonly boat. Trailering your boat offers so 
much freedom in where and when you use your boat that, in spite of the chal-
lenges of mastering trailering tactics (see Chapters 5 and 6 for more on traile-
ring your boat), more than 75,000 new boat trailers are sold each year. That’s 
equal to 25 to 30 percent of all new boats sold each year. For many, trailers 
are the most convenient way to store a boat.

Where to keep your trailered boat
A trailer gives you plenty of flexibility in storing your boat. Anyplace the 
trailer can be safely — and legally — parked becomes a storage option. This 
section covers a few common places to store a boat on a trailer.
Home storage
Home is where the heart is, and for many boaters, it’s where the boat is, 
too. Most boats on trailers are stored in their owners’ yards, driveways, or 
garages. If your trailered boat fits in your garage, all the better — it’s like 
having your own covered dry storage. It’s convenient, too, enabling you to 
clean, polish, and maintain your boat or add bling to it in the driveway while 
you sip a cold drink.
 
Many communities have ordinances against keeping a boat in the open on res-
idential property. In fact, as I write this, painters are painting my carport, and 
my smaller boat has been moved to the driveway. Within 48 hours of moving 
the boat, I received a notice from the zoning enforcement officers of Winter 
Park, Florida, requesting that I move the boat in five days or pay a fine of $250 
per day. I hope the painters are done soon.
Marina storage
Many marinas offer lot storage on their property where you can park your 
trailer with your boat on it, and for a fee, they’ll launch your boat for you. 
It’s a great compromise between free-style trailering and dry-stack storage, 
giving you the freedom to move your boat at your own discretion, change 
lakes, or haul your boat to your favorite service shop. These storage lots can 
cost half as much as dry-stack storage, although in urban settings where land 
is scarce there may be no savings at all.
Self-storage lots
You’ve probably seen storage lots in your community for things like RVs and 
boats. They offer gated security, allowing entrance only with valid security 
codes. These lots often provide video surveillance and sometimes on-premise 
personnel to make sure bad guys stay away from your boat. Parking slots 
are priced per foot, like dry storage or wet slips. The storage parking space 
for the larger of my two boats costs about one-fourth of what a dry-stack slip 
would cost, just to give you an idea of the savings.
Preparing your boat for open storage
Storing your boat on a trailer is practically as easy as falling out of the boat. 
But it doesn’t mean there aren’t some necessary preparations and precau-
tions to take to keep the boat safe and clean for your next trip. This section 

307
 Chapter 16: Finding a Safe Harbor for Your Boat
covers security, protection, and maintenance precautions to consider when 
storing your boat.
Securing your boat
Boats are popular targets for thieves. The trailer that makes your boat so 
easy for you to transport does the same for criminals, too. A variety of lock-
ing devices makes it at least difficult for thieves to haul your boat and trailer 
away. Without one or more of these devices, your boat can be hitched up and 
driven into a portside shipping container while you take a shower. Here are 
some security considerations:
 
✓ Keeping your boat locked inside your garage (if it fits) is the easiest way 
to ward off thieves. “Out of sight, out of mind” applies here.
 
✓ You can slip a padlock through the tongue-locking lever of the trailer so the 
tongue won’t fit over a trailer ball unless the lock is removed. Unfortunately, 
every thief worth his salt has a bolt cutter to quickly remove these. A better 
solution is a tongue lock available at marine stores or in the auto depart-
ment of discount stores. These locks fit over the entire trailer tongue, 
preventing it from fitting onto a trailer ball. Some can still be ground away 
with a grinder, but not quickly, and the odds that someone will be noticed 
while doing this dirty work reduce the odds they’ll try. You can find quite a 
variety of effective devices at marine retailers. I use one called a universal 
tongue lock I found at www.westmarine.com.
 
✓ Wheel locks rule. These are much like the boots the police use to pre-
vent a ticketed car from disappearing before the owner pays the fine. A 
wheel lock prevents the wheel it’s on from rolling, and the mechanism 
covers the lug nuts so the device can’t be defeated by removing the 
wheel and replacing it. (Check out some options at www.carrythebig
stick.com.)
 
✓ Some thieves target just an outboard motor or even the gear case of an 
outboard or the propeller. Special locking nuts are available to replace 
the standard nuts holding these components in place. They aren’t 
impossible to defeat, but they sure are discouraging. Also, the damage 
caused by removing them leaves a recognizable mark that raises ques-
tions when the items are resold. (Check some out at www.mcgard.com.)
 
✓ Dash-mounted electronics brackets make depth finders and GPS units 
vulnerable. When leaving your boat unattended, it’s best to remove 
these items and carry them inside in a gear bag. But if you prefer to 
leave them on the boat, locks to replace their mounting knobs can slow 
thieves down a bit (see www.durasafelocks.com).
 
✓ My favorite security device is cellphone based. It’s called GPS Snitch and 
uses the innards of a cellphone coupled with a motion-sensitive device 
that turns on the phone if the boat moves unexpectedly. This gadget 
also has a perimeter sensor that can be set to turn on when the boat 
moves beyond a certain point. When triggered, this device calls you and 
sends you an e-mail and a text message. Hide this baby in the boat, and 

308
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat 
when you get the message that your boat’s on the move, you can track it 
online and report its position to the authorities. (Find out more at www.
blacklinegps.com.)
Protecting your boat from the elements
Shielding your boat from the elements isn’t any different with a trailer than 
with dry-stack storage, except you won’t have anyone else but yourself to 
blame if it doesn’t get done! Covering your boat is essential. Even if you keep 
it in the garage, dirt and dust circulate and land more on your boat, it seems, 
than anywhere else. Here are a couple of tips to follow:
 
✓ Open your boat lockers to let them air out — unless you don’t plan to 
cover the boat, for some reason. Then you’re better off leaving the lock-
ers closed and latched.
 
✓ Remove the drain plug, and make sure the bilge is free of debris that may 
block the drain. If you forget this one and your cover isn’t totally water-
tight (most aren’t), water can accumulate in the bilge, and the weight of 
this water could overload your trailer, causing it to break down.
Weighing the pros and cons of trailering
Trailers are popular for innumerable reasons, but here are some of the most 
prominent pros and cons:
 
✓ Pro: Freedom of where and when you boat is the key advantage. With a 
trailer, you’re dependant on no one to haul your boat to the water and 
launch it, and you can trailer the rig to any water big enough to handle 
the boat.
 
✓ Pro: A trailer is convenient when it comes time to take your boat to a 
service shop, and it allows you to wax and otherwise care for your boat 
in your own driveway.
 
✓ Pro: Trailer storage is a low-cost way of storing your boat, especially if 
you can keep it in your garage, driveway, or yard.
 
✓ Con: The whole body of knowledge surrounding trailering a boat — such 
as how to back up the darn thing (see Chapter 5) — is something many 
boaters don’t want to tangle with.
 
✓ Con: Trailering your boat can cut your fuel economy by more than half — 
especially if you’re towing at or near the maximum of your vehicle’s 
towing capacity. For example, my four-door V-8 pickup truck gets 17 
miles per gallon on the highway without a load. It gets 7 to 8 miles per 
gallon when pulling my 5,500-pound boat and trailer. That’s not so pain-
ful on a 20-mile run to the water, but it’s often a deal breaker for a 100-
mile run. The cost of fuel for towing makes rack storage economical.

In This Chapter
▶ Making the most of your boat’s galley
▶ Preparing food and drinks for a day or weekend on the water
▶ Staying safe from the risks and effects of alcohol
P
art of the fun of boating is having a picnic on the water, or even several 
of them if you plan to spend a weekend afloat on a larger boat. Almost 
all boats have built-in coolers or, even better, a dedicated storage spot that’s 
a perfect fit for a cooler you pack at home and bring onboard. Your boat’s 
galley may be as simple as an ice chest or as complete as a kitchen just like 
home. Even smaller cruisers are likely to have microwaves and coffee pots, 
making cool mornings on the water a new kind of pleasure. Eating well in 
compact kitchens and cooking onboard your boat require planning and 
special packing, but the effort is well worth it.
This chapter is all about keeping hydrated and preventing your stomach 
and those of your crew from growling by providing refreshments and snacks 
in style. I explain how to make the most of your cooler space and onboard 
refrigerator; how to prepare in advance for snack attacks, picnic meals, or 
outdoor barbecues; how to minimize the mess of food and drink onboard; 
and how to keep safe when enjoying alcoholic beverages onboard.
Navigating Your Galley
Your galley is your kitchen on the water. In a runabout, the galley is just 
whatever you bring along in a cooler and whatever you can cook on a grill if 
you bring one. But even small cuddy cabins and cruisers may be equipped 
with sinks, stoves, and refrigerators, and boats that break the 30-foot mark 
often also have a sink and a grill installed in the cockpit — that fun open-
seating area where you drive and all your adorers hang out and worship you 
for taking them boating.

310
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat  
Refrigerators and coolers
Coolers are the main mode of keeping things cold on boats, but many boats 
you’d swear were too small to have a refrigerator actually have one that 
runs on both 110-volt power from the shore and 12-volt power from the 
boat’s battery. I’ve seen refrigerators on a lot of little cuddies and even some 
runabouts between 23 and 27 feet long.
Using onboard fridges
If you get a 110/12-volt refrigerator on your boat, expect it to be about the 
size of the beer-filled box you had in your college dorm (you rulebreaker, 
you). It works great to keep things cool, but it’s slow to make things cool in 
the first place. In fact, it may never make things cool if you put them in warm 
and try to run the fridge on your boat’s battery.
 
Here are some tips for using an onboard fridge:
 
✓ Pre-chill all the drinks and food you plan to put in it. You may prefer to 
put only chilled food in the fridge rather than drinks. You need to get 
drinks more often than food, so keeping drinks in a cooler increases the 
efficiency of the fridge because you open it less often.
 
✓ Whenever you’re in port with the boat, connect it to the onshore 
electrical power to preserve battery power.
 
✓ When running the fridge on 12-volt battery power, keep a close eye 
on the voltage indicator on the fuse panel in the cabin — if the gauge 
indicates voltage below 12 volts, run the motor to recharge the battery.
 
✓ Open the fridge as infrequently as possible so it runs less and keeps cool 
with less power.
Making the most of built-in coolers and cooler spaces
These containers do the heavy lifting of keeping things cold on a boat — even 
if there’s a refrigerator. In fact, most boats are equipped with built-in coolers 
or compartments made to fit coolers and keep them secure yet accessible.
I prefer hard coolers to soft coolers because soft coolers often develop leaks. 
My wife, on the other hand, prefers soft coolers because they tend to fit more 
easily in various compartments, making them easier to stow.
 
She gave me some tips for keeping the contents of both kinds cold:
 
✓ If you’re taking food along, pack it in a cooler separate from the one 
holding drinks. Stow the food cooler safely out of the sun and away from 
prying little fingers. It will stay cold longer if you open it as infrequently 
as possible.

311
 Chapter 17: The Well-Fed Boater
 
✓ Choose a cooler size that fits the day and the work it has to do, and fill it 
to the top with ice, eliminating air space so the ice thaws more slowly.
 
✓ Open the drain on your cooler so melting ice water can drain out to 
the bilge. Many people mistakenly believe that retaining the cold water 
retains the chill on the cooler contents. However, studies by the folks 
at Coleman, a major manufacturer of coolers and camping gear, say just 
the opposite is true.
 
The more you open coolers, the faster they warm up and the ice in them 
thaws. Open your coolers as infrequently as possible.
Appliances that bring the heat
Small cuddies and cruisers, the size of boat you can easily trailer from lake 
to lake, often come equipped with alcohol or propane stoves and sometimes 
with electric stoves. Microwaves and coffee makers also are increasingly 
popular. Here’s how these items may fit into your boating cuisine routine:
 
✓ Electric stoves: These run on 110-volt power, so you need to either be 
connected to 110-volt shore power or run a generator (also called a 
genset) onboard. Unless you use a genset to run air conditioning, too, 
generating your own power is an expensive way to cook.
 
✓ Built-in gas or alcohol stoves: Gas or alcohol stoves heat things up 
safely and quickly with a minimum amount of fuel and no battery drain 
or need for a genset. If you plan to cook much using your stove, opt for 
one of these.
 
✓ Portable gas stoves: As opposed to a built-in gas stove, there are a 
variety of gas stoves available at camping and marine stores that make 
short work of cooking onboard and stow away safely when you’re done.
 
✓ Coffee makers: On boats, these usually run on 12-volt battery power. Be 
sure you have a full battery before you run a coffee maker, or start the 
motor and let it run a little while — maybe five minutes — to bring the 
battery back up to snuff.
 
Grilling onboard is becoming one of the most popular ways to dine while 
boating. Many stainless-steel marine grills from well-known companies like 
Coleman and Magma are specially designed for boats. Here are some details 
on how they work:
 
✓ You can mount a boat-friendly grill safely on a stainless-steel boat rail or 
on a special rack that fits into rod holders in the gunwale (the top of the 
side of the boat). When the cooking is done and the grill is cool, you can 
just stow it away.

312
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat  
 
✓ Some grills require a small canister of propane that you screw into the 
gas regulator on the side of the grill. Charcoal grills are also available 
and usually cost the same as or more than propane grills. Some boaters 
prefer the taste real charcoal smoke puts to the food.
 
✓ Most boat grills have piezo starters that ignite them at the touch of a 
button.
 
I recommend that you only use a designated boat grill for grilling onboard, and 
most I’ve seen are fueled by propane tanks, although you can find a charcoal 
marine grill here and there. They need to be mounted on rails or mounts that 
fit in fishing rod holders. Any other kind of grill is apt to be dangerous and 
require you to revisit my discussion of what to do in case of a fire in Chapter 12.
Civilized eating: Tools and utensils
What’s civilized at home may be overkill on a boat. In a day boat, a roll of 
paper towels and maybe some plastic utensils are fine for so-called elegant 
galley cuisine. Of course, the more elaborate your galley, the more refined 
your food prep skills, and the more tools and utensils you’ll find you need 
to make a happy meal. In this chapter, I assume that you only need the bare 
essentials — say maybe a boat grill and a microwave.
The following points address items to consider bringing onboard for 
mealtimes; you can take or leave my advice:
 
✓ Say what you want about being green — there’s nothing green about 
dirty dishes on a boat. Take along paper or Styrofoam plates and plastic 
cups or drinks in individual containers to cut back on the mess that you 
have to carry back to port.
 
✓ Foil is the ideal accessory to make a disposable vegetable steaming tray 
or to line the grill with to keep it clean.
 
✓ Resealable bags are the best containers on boats. From plastic utensils 
to fresh vegetables to filleted fish from the day’s catch — they all fit in 
resealable bags and take up the least amount of storage space.
 
✓ Plastic utensils are nice if you absolutely can’t eat corn on the cob and 
barbecue chicken with your fingers.
 
✓ You’ll likely need a sharp knife. I keep a couple filet knives onboard, and 
that suffices for most things. Remember, less is more on a boat.
 
✓ Trash bags are essential. Keep one handy to collect empty soda cans for 
recycling, and use another for disposable plates, utensils, and garbage. 
Twist the ends between uses, and then use twist-ties to tightly seal the 
bags when full.

 Chapter 17: The Well-Fed Boater
Planning to Eat, Drink, and Be Merry
The key to fun, food, and drinks onboard is advance planning. Stopping by the 
grocery store on your way to the lake to pick up a case of shelf-temperature 
soda and a bag of ice will leave you sipping warm sodas in an hour. Improperly 
handled food could leave you with another problem altogether.
This section contains tips for making ice, chilling drinks, and setting up meals 
in trouble-free packaging. For the best results, you have to accept the fact 
that preparation takes a little more time than just slipping something out of 
the package and slapping it on the grill.
Keeping your stuff cold: 
You gotta pre-chill
Early in my career, I ran a resort and a small rental marina. On weekends, we 
couldn’t stock enough bagged ice to keep the boaters happy. And we couldn’t 
make them understand that four cases of warm beer stuck in a small onboard 
refrigerator take about three days to cool down. That was simply too much 
volume of warm matter for a fridge to make cold. Sometimes our refrigerators 
died trying to do it.
Ice may be the answer, but the question is, “Did you pre-chill your drinks?” 
Here are some tips for getting things chilled and keeping them that way:
 
✓ Drinks: Either buy your drinks cold on the day you depart with the boat, 
or chill them at home over time and keep them that way until you load 
them into coolers. Putting more than a case of warm drinks in a boat 
fridge takes too long to chill and burns too much power. Plan ahead and 
add your drinks to your home refrigerator 12 at a time so you have what 
you want already cold when you’re ready to go.
 
✓ Ice-to-drink ratio: Pack your cooler full of cold drinks then add ice. Half 
the volume of your cooler should be ice, and the other half drinks.
 
✓ Bottled water: If you plan to take bottled water, freeze the bottles a few 
days before you go. You can put them between other drinks for chillin’ 
power and even add them on top. As they thaw, they also provide plenty 
of thirst-quenching power.
 
✓ Extra ice: Make slabs of ice by filling zippered freezer bags with water 
and laying them in the freezer. When frozen, you can stack them along 
the sides of your cooler, forming a wall of ice to keep the inside cool. 
Also, 2-liter soda bottles filled with water and then frozen make perfect 
ice packs to lay in large coolers or in the fish boxes of fishing boats to 
keep your catch cool.

314
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat  
 
✓ Block ice over bagged: For large containers and especially food 
containers, if you buy ice, buy block ice. It thaws more slowly than 
bagged, often taking days instead of hours, which helps preserve food 
on long trips. But if bagged ice is all you have access to, get the most 
your coolers can hold.
 
✓ Freezer packs: These are the things — often filled with blue goo — that 
you freeze and then put in your cooler for cooling. They work fine, but 
they take up space that could be devoted to frozen drink bottles, which 
provide something to drink as they melt. Still, freezer packs work well in 
food coolers because they don’t thaw and drip on food, making it soggy.
Having plenty of drinks on the drink
Water, water, everywhere . . . and not a drop to drink. That’s the lament in 
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. It’s no less true today, even in fresh water 
because practically no untreated water is safe to drink anymore. What’s 
more, the refreshing feel of fresh water on your body is apt to make you fail 
to notice your thirst. And by the time you feel thirsty, medical experts agree, 
you’re well on the way to dehydration.
To keep your crew refreshed, alert, and chillin’, consider these guidelines 
regarding your beverage options:
 
✓ Water: Water is the best hydrator. It may be hard to get kids to drink 
it, but water quenches thirst better than sugared sodas and even juice, 
although juice boxes are a good second choice for the most stubborn 
little boaters.
 
✓ Sodas: Soda isn’t the best hydrator, but it still does the job, and nothing 
beats the fizz and flavor. Adults can regulate their intake, keeping their 
hydration needs in mind, but kids are a different matter. I take sodas 
onboard my boat and let my kids drink them only if they alternate each 
soda with a bottle of water.
 
✓ Sports drinks: Sports drinks are designed to replace the electrolytes 
your body uses or loses when it sweats. There seems to be enough 
science around their effectiveness that I’m a proponent of drinking one 
or two on a really hot day on the water.
 
✓ Single-serving drink mixes: One of the handiest things I’ve found for 
boating are individual powdered drink mixes that come in little single-
serving packets. You simply add them to a bottle of water, shake it up 
to dissolve, and enjoy. I keep some onboard my boat at all times. They 
offer great variety for a big crew: Popular sports drinks, iced tea, and 
even energy drinks come in these little packets.

315
 Chapter 17: The Well-Fed Boater
 
✓ Coffee or tea bags: I can’t go out without my morning coffee. Just forget 
it. But it’s also a pain to make coffee onboard, sometimes even with a 
coffee maker. Coffee bags, like tea bags, make an individual cup, and 
unless your pipes are used to being burnished daily by the high-test 
coffee chain variety, you’ll find that coffee bags make a fairly robust cup 
on a chilly morning. You can microwave the water in port, or heat it in a 
pot on your grill. Or, pack a thermos of hot water so you and your crew 
can choose between coffee, tea, or even hot cocoa.
A navy travels on its stomach
I think the old saying may have been “An army travels on its stomach,” but 
you get the point, right? Keeping a mixed crew happy requires snacks, meals, 
and sweets. Keeping them fed without trashing the boat or loading it up with 
a supply train of gargantuan coolers and grocery bags adds to the challenge.
In this section, I explain some tips for stocking the galley that work for a 
day or a week. And they work with a minimum of your work done onboard, 
although you need to invest a little time at home.
Scaring up snacks for any time of day
Being out in the sun and the water takes a lot out of you, so it’s a good idea 
to keep up your energy throughout the day with some healthy snacks — and 
okay, maybe some less healthy ones, too. Here are some recommendations:
 
✓ Apples and grapes make great snacks and come in their own all-natural 
wrappers. All you have to do is wash ’em, chill ’em, drop ’em in a cooler, 
and haul ’em out when the munchies get to you and your crew. They’re 
no substitute for candy bars — at least not in my kids’ eyes — but they 
offer a healthy option.
 
✓ Baby carrots, broccoli and cauliflower florets, and celery sticks 
chopped, bagged in zippered bags, chilled in advance, and packed 
along with a disposable container of dip makes for great snacking for the 
nutrition-minded.
 
✓ Nuts, granola, raisins, and trail mix don’t have to be chilled and offer 
strong doses of fruit, fiber, and protein.
 
✓ Candy isn’t on the list of needs, but boating is a special event, and 
reserving special treats for special events makes everything even more 
fun. I buy the bite-size candy bars, freeze them, and drop them in the 
cooler. Dole them out one at a time so you don’t end up with candy 
sticking to the boat or the snack eaters.

316
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat  
Gearing up for breakfast
Some boaters just use snacks for breakfast, but a real breakfast can be a nice 
touch onboard. I’ve had good experiences with cooking an egg casserole in 
advance and warming it up onboard. That led to a few other ideas:
 
✓ Buy a premade piecrust at the grocery store — even better is one that 
comes in its own disposable pie pan. Scramble about six eggs and pour 
them into it, add three or four chopped sausage links, and layer on 
some grated cheese — whatever kind you like. Bake it in the oven for 
35 minutes at 350 degrees. Let it cool, and then freeze it for packing in 
the cooler. Chances are that after a night onboard it will be thawed and 
you can heat it up on a grill or galley stove. If you’re in port, slice it onto 
plastic plates and microwave it.
 
✓ Scramble eggs together with diced cooked ham, and freeze the mix in a 
disposable container. At breakfast, lay out flour tortillas and spoon on the 
eggs and ham. Sprinkle on grated cheese, roll it up, and lay it on a sheet of 
foil on the grill for warming. Add a little salsa for some zip if you please!
 
✓ Single-serving cups of yogurt, half-pints of milk, single-serving cereal 
boxes, and granola provide the makings of a grab-bag breakfast that’s 
quick, disposable, and likely to please most tastes.
 
Scrambled eggs are easy to prepare and eat onboard, and unlike fried 
eggs, practically anyone who likes eggs at all can enjoy scrambled eggs. To 
eliminate the issues of handling fragile eggs, crack and scramble all you need 
for a trip and put them in an airtight disposable storage container. There’s no 
breakage and no egg shells to handle onboard, and you save a ton of space in 
the fridge.
Laying out lazy lunches
In this section I lay down some no-cook lunch options because on a hot day, 
cool food cools you off and hot food isn’t as appealing — save that for the 
evening when the sun rolls low in the sky.
 
✓ Sandwiches: Get bags of sliced cheese, deli meat, and mixed salad 
greens from the produce department. Chill the salad with the meat 
and cheese, and stow the bread anywhere it won’t get crushed. Make 
sandwiches onboard when stomachs start to grumble.
 
✓ Wraps: Soft tortilla wraps are easier to eat onboard than sandwiches 
because everything is self-contained. The wraps themselves can’t get 
crushed under a bag of beach towels, either. Simply lay your favorite 
sandwich stuffing on a tortilla, and roll it up.
 
✓ Canned/packaged meats: Tuna, chicken, and — oh, I may as well 
mention it — Spam don’t need refrigeration until they’re opened, which 
makes them handy for boating. With the tuna or chicken, you can flake 
it onto a bed of bagged salad greens in a disposable bowl for a pretty 
classy-looking salad.

317
 Chapter 17: The Well-Fed Boater
 
Save those leftover mayo and ketchup packets from your last fast-food 
stop — they come in very handy onboard. Otherwise, buy smaller containers 
of condiments that fit easily in the cooler.
Digging into dinner
In my opinion, dinner should be hot even onboard a boat, so I assume 
you have one of those handy grills I mention earlier (refer to the section 
“Appliances that bring the heat”) or you have a gas or alcohol stove (either 
built-in or portable). Obviously, dinner possibilities are endless, but to spark 
your imagination, the following list includes some handy ways my family gets 
a hot onboard meal that tastes pretty close to home cooked — or better. You 
can substitute marinades or seasonings and even meats and vegetables as 
you please, and the cooking techniques are a breeze. What’s even better is 
that most of these meals can be prepared at home in individual portions just 
perfect for slapping on the grill.
 
✓ Boy scout stew is something I picked up as a kid. We laid out a sheet 
of foil and piled in slices of potato, a slice of onion, carrots, and a ham-
burger patty. Then we folded the foil over and crimped the edges to 
make it nearly watertight and threw it on the grill. Thirty minutes later 
we had a pretty darn good hot meal. Do the same with 4- to 6-ounce 
pieces of chicken or beef and add the vegetables you prefer. Sprinkle 
with seasonings, and drizzle on some olive oil before sealing the packet.
 
✓ Any type of grilled meat is a favorite of mine onboard. Steaks take only 
about ten minutes on hot marine grills, and chicken breasts only take a 
few minutes longer to get safely cooked through. Accompanying veggies 
may take longer, so close them up in foil packets and give them a head 
start on the grill.
 
✓ Kabobs make you look like a great cook because they’re packed with 
tasty bites and are somewhat out of the ordinary. Prepare them in 
advance, wrap them individually, and just lay them on the grill as 
needed. Soak bamboo skewers in water (to make them resistant to the 
heat of the grill) while you quarter tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, and 
portabella mushrooms. Cube your meat, and then alternate between 
items, skewering them on the bamboo skewers. Wrap them in foil, and 
throw them on the grill. The great thing about kabobs is that there are 
so many different items to choose from that everyone ends up happy.
Planning your weekend meals
Planning food for a whole weekend really only requires penciling up a menu 
and getting the portions prepared. The trick is packing them in the cooler so 
you can find each item when you need it. If you follow these tips, you’ll be 
able to get what you want out of the cooler without too much guesswork or 
digging around:
 
✓ At least two days before your boating trip, wrap individual meals in foil, 
mark the contents, and put them in the freezer.

318
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat  
 
✓ Follow your menu plan in reverse when you pack the cooler and put 
your last meal of the trip in the cooler first. If it’s dinner on Sunday, add 
Sunday lunch on top of it. Then add Saturday dinner and Saturday lunch 
on top of that.
 
✓ Lay frozen water bottles or frozen flat zippered bags of ice in between 
servings to keep the food cold. As you work your way through the menu 
while you’re boating, feel free to drink the bottled water as it thaws.
A word about alcohol
As a refreshment onboard, perhaps few beverages are more popular than a 
couple of cold beers. But when boating accidents are analyzed, investigators 
find that more often than not, alcohol was involved. That’s not saying the 
boaters were drunk — but they often had “a beer or two,” as the saying goes.
 
While you’re boating, the wind, the sun, the body’s propensity for dehydra-
tion, and the motion of the ocean (or lake) all combine to increase the impact 
of alcohol on your balance, judgment, and coordination. One beer at sea can 
equal a landlubber’s two or three.
Still, it’s not illegal to drink while boating in many states. However, in all 
states it is illegal to drive a boat while under the influence. Many states apply 
boating alcohol offenses against your driver’s license, too. And many states 
have a strict blood alcohol content limit of .08. At that level, it usually takes 
less than two 12-ounce beers for most people to hit the uh-oh mark.
Drinking onboard isn’t just about the captain’s coordination, either. A crew-
member approaching the blood alcohol limit is more apt to have an accident 
onboard that could end the day — or worse.
I’m not a teetotaler and don’t expect my crew to be, but if I’m boating in a 
state where it isn’t illegal altogether, I take precautions by loading no more 
beers on my boat than two per legal-aged drinker. Also, rarely do I drink 
more than half of one beer with lunch. Usually I save my two until the boat is 
in the driveway and I’m washing it up — it sure is nice to have ’em then!
I find that when I don’t drink, my crew drinks sparingly with little discussion 
about the issue. We come in happy and have the party in the driveway while 
we hose down the boat.

Getting Your Feet Wet 
with Boat Clubs
In This Chapter
▶ Giving boating a try by way of fishing clubs
▶ Joining in clubs and events centered around specific boat brands
▶ Coasting into boating with the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary
▶ Sharing the cost of boat ownership with timeshare-like clubs
B
oat clubs provide a great way to build a social circle around the 
sport and get some hands-on experience before taking the ownership 
experience by the horns. In this chapter, I explain how to locate different 
types of clubs in your area, get yourself in the door, and maybe even get 
a taste of boating before you ever plunk down a down payment. Beware, 
though — after you connect with some new, enthusiastic boating friends, 
you may get hooked!
Getting Hooked on Fishing Clubs
Fishing clubs are a great way to gain some experience in boating and fishing, 
and you don’t necessarily have to own a boat to join in the fun. For small 
monthly dues, you can socialize with other boaters and get a leg up on 
fishing tactics. Clubs often conduct fishing tournaments and give non-boating 
anglers a chance to fish with and learn from experienced boating anglers in 
exchange for sharing the cost of gas. And the awards in tournaments may be 
trophies or cash prizes.
In this section, I explain how fishing clubs can help you become a better boater 
and angler and what you can expect when you join one. I also kick-start your 
search for a local fishing club.

320
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat  
 
If you join a fishing club as a prospective boater, make sure your new friends 
know that you want to learn the game. Tell them that you’d like to help with 
mooring, tying lines, setting the anchor, and other boat tasks. Stating your 
interest upfront ensures that you’ll be treated more like a boating partner than 
a guest, which is a better way to learn.
What fishing clubs have to offer
Fishing clubs conduct many fun and engaging activities: Tournaments, 
barbecues, seminars on fishing tactics and boating safety, and organized 
trips to various lakes and streams are all part of the mix. Following are some 
of the benefits you can expect from fishing clubs and their regular activities:
 
✓ Hone your fishing skills: Reading about fishing tactics, lures, and places 
is a good beginning for building a framework of fishing knowledge. But 
nothing puts the art of fishing into perspective like hands-on training. 
In fishing clubs, you can connect with many different anglers, probably 
catch a boat ride with them, and get some on-the-job training for being 
an effective boater and angler.
 
✓ Compete in fishing tournaments: Fishing tournaments bring anglers 
together in competitions that can be casual, with white elephant awards 
for winners, or serious, with awards in the thousands of dollars. Bigger 
entry fees go with bigger awards, so when real prize money is at stake, 
you should pony up part of your host boat’s entry fee as well as part of 
the gas cost, and you also should take the angling as seriously as your 
host does. Personally, I prefer the more casual tournaments, but as with 
golf, the game can be more fun with big stakes.
Finding the right fishing 
club for your interests
Species-specific fishing clubs exist for practically every enthusiast. Some clubs 
are more regional in nature and seek only to bring other anglers together for 
the common cause of having fun and learning more about fishing. On the other 
hand, finding competitive clubs is pretty easy, too. In this section, I give you 
some leads for tracking down the fishing groups near you, and I also list a 
sampling of clubs that specialize in the pursuit of freshwater species.
Bass clubs
The black bass is the most abundant game-fish species in North America. 
I’d be willing to bet that the lion’s share of fishing clubs are bass clubs that 
promote bass fishing. Here are some national bass-fishing groups that may 
very well have a chapter in your area:

321
 Chapter 18: Getting Your Feet Wet with Boat Clubs
 
✓ Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (BASS) is a nationally renowned club 
for serious bass anglers. Local chapters of BASS called Federation Nation 
clubs conduct tournaments that begin the qualifying process for hopeful 
professional anglers who want to fish for hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in prize money. Find out more about this organization and locate 
a club in your area by visiting sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/
bassmaster/federation/index.
 
✓ FLW Outdoors is a group formed by the parent company of Ranger 
Boats. This national tournament-fishing organization has local chapters 
that can be casual or very hard-core, and competitors from local tourna-
ments can progress through the fishing circuit and eventually compete 
in top FLW tournaments for the ultimate cash prize, $1 million. Find out 
more at www.flwoutdoors.com.
 
✓ Unaffiliated clubs are local clubs that stay out of the national limelight 
of BASS and FLW but still have a central organization and a free mem-
bership magazine called Bass Club Digest. Members enjoy these clubs 
because they don’t require membership in the national umbrella clubs. 
You can find a local club by visiting www.bassclubdigest.org/
find_bass_club.htm.
Walleye clubs
Walleye clubs are most popular in the northern Midwest where walleye are 
most abundant. The season is short for catching this cold-country species, 
but the anglers who pursue them are relentless, systematic, and often eager 
to embrace people who want to learn how to fish for walleye.
Here’s the scoop on some walleye club options:
 
✓ In-Fisherman Professional Walleye Trail is similar to BASS and 
FLW (refer to the previous section on bass fishing clubs) but doesn’t 
coordinate local clubs, although it does coordinate local tournaments. 
Often these tournaments are buddy tournaments, so anglers with 
boats are looking for anglers without boats to fish together and share 
expenses. You can discover more about these tournaments by visiting 
www.in-fisherman.com/pwt.
 
✓ Local walleye clubs are available in many areas, but finding them 
through a national organization isn’t as easy as finding most bass clubs. 
Nevertheless, I located several simply by typing “local walleye fishing 
clubs” into my favorite Internet search engine. You also can turn to local 
tackle stores, which often post meeting announcements and can help 
you find local club contacts.
Other club opportunities
Beyond the tournament fishing craze, other fishing clubs exist with the 
primary goal of conservation, not competition. Following are two options:

322
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat  
 
✓ Muskie clubs (many of which are located in the Midwest) serve anglers 
addicted to muskellunge, as this kind of fish is formally called. The 
Latin name means wolf, and as a predator, few fish are more notorious 
for either ripping tackle apart in a fight or turning their noses up at an 
angler’s bait just inches shy of the boat. The wolf fish grows to more 
than 4 feet long! Attend a meeting of a local muskie club and you’re likely 
to be seduced by secret lures and the pursuit of the muskie with tales 
of success and failure. Muskie anglers fish for the glory of the catch 
and seldom keep their fish, releasing them as quickly as possible so the 
fish will live to fight again. (Enter “local muskie fishing clubs” into your 
favorite search engine to see what chapters exist in your area.)
 
✓ The Coastal Conservation Association (CCA) is more of a conservation 
club than a fishing club, but nearly all its members fish and prefer to do 
so in coastal waters. CCA members are concerned because fragile salt 
marshes, estuaries, and coastal flats are vulnerable to pollution, excessive 
commercial fishing, and even excessive recreational fishing. Local chapters 
of the CCA work to balance the fun of fishing with promoting safeguards to 
make the waters flourish. Find out more at www.joincca.org.
Joining Boat-Brand Clubs 
and Rendezvous
Some years ago, Jeep and Harley Davidson realized that people bought their 
brand of products because they identified with the brand and wanted to 
associate with other people who also liked it. Boat builders and many of their 
dealers quickly learned that the same was true of boat owners and began 
starting their own boat-brand clubs. They also began to organize national 
brand rendezvous that sometimes draw thousands of boaters sharing brand 
loyalty together.
It turns out that these brand-centered clubs and rendezvous help new 
and would-be boaters grow into the sport and give experienced boaters an 
exciting new social outlet to pursue with their boats.
Finding boat-brand clubs
It’s not hard to find boat-brand clubs in your area. Boat dealers often organize 
them for the express purpose of capturing the imaginations and interest of new 
boaters and welcoming them into the sport — and especially to their own boat 
brands, of course. Here are some suggestions for making connections:

323
 Chapter 18: Getting Your Feet Wet with Boat Clubs
 
✓ Visit a local boat dealer. One of the best ways to find boat-brand clubs 
is to visit your local dealer. In my town, several dealers of various 
brands have clubs that conduct regular weekend rendezvous.
 
✓ Do a Web search. Finding most anything online today is pretty easy. 
Suppose you live in Topeka, Kansas, and you want to find an Aquasport 
club in your area. If one exists, chances are it will come up when you 
do a Web search of “Aquasport Topeka Kansas” at your favorite search 
engine.
Tapping in to rendezvous
Rendezvous are events for specific boat-brand owners, and boat builders 
usually conduct these fun events, with the help of their local dealers, to 
encourage people to consider their brand of boat. These rendezvous are 
thoroughly enjoyable events and put you squarely in the middle of like-
minded boaters. For example, one of the most wildly successful boat 
rendezvous is Aquapalooza, a Sea Ray Boats event that the company moves 
around the country to various popular lakes. All the boat builder–sponsored 
events I’ve run into are family events and often have activities specifically 
organized for kids.
 
Manufacturers of fishing boats often conduct rendezvous as well, and their 
activities are often centered on fishing (big surprise). Rendezvous can be 
annual or even monthly events, and many times even boaters with a different 
brand of boat, or no boat at all, can wrangle an invitation.
You can find these events in much the same way as the local clubs:
 
✓ Contact a local dealer. As I said before, boat-brand makers’ rendezvous 
are often affiliated with local dealers. Finding these events is usually 
pretty easy. In my community they are advertised in newspapers, and 
most boat dealers are aware of them and can give you a contact.
 
✓ Check the manufacturers’ Web sites. Most boat brands that conduct 
rendezvous post details about them on their Web sites.
Joining a Watersports Club
Water-skiing and wakeboarding clubs exist to bring skiers and board riders 
together to learn from each other and become better skiers and riders. Many 
exist to train members for competitive ski and wakeboard tournaments, but 
many operate just for fun and practice as well.

324
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat  
Water-ski clubs tend to be rarer than fishing clubs, but if serious board 
sports are your passion, you should ask your boat dealer or check online for 
a local team. I found many ski clubs listed at aquaskier.com.
Clubs always have experts (and sometimes professional instructors) on hand 
to help tune up your ride. Often, your membership dues in a watersports 
club get you access to a club boat, complete with experienced drivers. You 
can hone your skiing or wakeboarding under the best possible circumstances 
and just hang up your ski or board when you’re done.
Joining the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary
Perhaps the most prestigious boat club in the United States is the U.S. Coast 
Guard Auxiliary. This volunteer organization specializes in teaching its mem-
bers the same skills taught to every Coast Guard cadet. Experienced auxiliary 
members work with the Coast Guard in search and rescue efforts and in con-
ducting safety seminars and inspections of personal boats (see Figure 18-1).
 
If you’re considering boating (and I assume you are simply because you’ve 
picked up this book), I encourage you to join a local Coast Guard Auxiliary 
branch. You’ll receive training in boat skills and safety, enjoy the camaraderie 
of being around other boaters and water-lovers, and gain on-the-water 
experience in the many boats of your fellow auxiliary members.
As I said, the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary is a volunteer organization that 
works directly with the U.S Coast Guard. Here’s how it works and some other 
pertinent info:
 
✓ Who’s qualified to volunteer: Men and women over the age of 17 
interested in assisting the Coasties in various safety and other volunteer 
missions may join the Auxiliary.
 
✓ Duties: Volunteers are trained in safe boat handling and boater safety, 
and sometimes they even assist in search and rescue missions. The 
Auxiliary is often referred to as the marine equivalent of the Civil Air 
Patrol.
 
✓ No boat needed: Auxiliary volunteers don’t need their own boats to 
participate in water-based activities, but as your skills and commitment 
increase, you’ll eventually want to acquire a uniform, which is pretty 
snazzy.
 
✓ Finding a local flotilla: Every state has an Auxiliary presence and 
may have many U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary flotillas, which are like club 
chapters. To find a flotilla in your area, visit nws.cgaux.org/
flotillafinder/index.html.

Some Boat Clubs Are Like Timeshares
Ever been to Disneyland or some other popular tourist destination and been 
inundated with offers for free gifts, free tickets, or free lodging if you sign up 
for a tour of a timeshare condo project? In those properties, instead of paying 
for the whole condo, you pay a fractional price for the week or two that you 
get to use the condo every year.
A similar arrangement exists for boaters. These clubs go by many names, 
and they operate under a wide variety of arrangements. The label fractional 
ownership boat club fits some of these groups, but others don’t really offer 
ownership of anything — your dues simply give you access to the fleet. In 
this section, I explain the benefits of club ownership — and a few of the 
liabilities as well.
Joining a fractional ownership boat club
Fractional ownership boat clubs are pretty cool, really. You buy in with an 
initiation fee — go ahead, call it a down payment — and you get a share of a 
boat or even a share of a fleet of boats. Your access is based on a reservation 
system and usually guarantees a minimum number of prime weekends or 
holidays, so you don’t get stuck only with off-peak times you can’t easily use.

326
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat  
Finding the clubs
To find fractional ownership clubs near you, enter “boat clubs” and the name 
of your state into your favorite search engine. Here are a few I’ve received 
some information about in the course of my work at Boating Life magazine:
 
✓ Freedomboatclub.com: Established in 1989, this club has locations in 
12 states on the eastern seaboard. Its reservation system is accessible 
online and by phone.
 
✓ www.sailtime.com/member/power: SailTime offers training for 
wannabe boaters as well as access to a fleet of boats. The company 
has many operations in popular boating destinations.
 
✓ Allpointsboatingclub.com/boating.htm: Initiation fees and 
monthly dues in this boating club cover fractional use for three years. 
An online system handles reservations. All Points Boating Club only 
serves members in central Florida, but a quick Web search can reveal 
similar clubs in your area.
What you pay upfront
Most fractional ownership clubs collect a membership fee upfront. Different 
clubs use the funds in different ways and grant different privileges. Here are a 
couple of the possibilities:
 
✓ Initiation fees: Some clubs call their initial membership fee an initiation 
fee. Depending on the club and the boats it offers, that fee can be from 
$5,000 to $50,000 or more. That’s a one-time charge to belong to the 
club. As with country clubs, some memberships can be resold under 
certain circumstances, and sometimes you forfeit the fee if you leave the 
club for any reason.
 
✓ Ownership fees: Other clubs operate on more of an ownership basis, 
similar to a timeshare. Although you don’t actually own any one boat, 
you own a sort of stock in the club that entitles you to reserve any of 
its assets (boats) for use. This kind of membership can often, but not 
always, be transferred or resold.
 
Often your access to certain classes of boats is restricted by your fee. It would 
be nice if a $5,000 membership fee gave you access to a 45-foot cruiser, but 
chances are that a $5,000 membership limits you to boats of a certain size or 
class. You wouldn’t expect to buy a cruiser for the price of a runabout, and 
likewise pricing for club memberships can come with some limitations that 
you can overcome only by paying a bigger membership fee.
Paying periodic and assessment fees
In addition to an initiation or ownership fee, many boat clubs charge 
recurring fees along with additional fees for extraordinary expenses.

327
 Chapter 18: Getting Your Feet Wet with Boat Clubs
 
✓ Monthly or annual operations fees: Most clubs levy monthly or annual 
fees to cover the cost of maintaining the boats. Oil changes, routine 
service, docking or storage fees, and insurance are some of the expenses 
these fees go toward. The beauty of such an arrangement is that the 
club monitors the bills, writes the checks, and handles the drudgery of 
the business of boating!
 
✓ Assessments: Sometimes unexpected losses occur within a boat 
ownership club. Perhaps a hurricane or a tornado strikes the storage or 
marine facilities, and damages result that aren’t covered by insurance. In 
many cases, you must pay additional fees to maintain the club.
Incurring boating expenses
Anytime you boat, you incur boating expenses above and beyond the normal 
boat-maintenance costs, such as filling up with gas, adding oil, washing the 
boat, and paying launch fees. Your club handles those chores for you, but 
you still have to pay for them.
 
✓ Fuel, oil, and launch fees: The club incurs these fees when getting your 
reserved boat ready for the water. It passes the fees down to you in a 
monthly statement or asks you to pay up when you return for the day.
 
✓ Concierge fees: The fee for provisioning the boat is money well spent. 
With a call ahead, you can have your reserved boat stocked with drinks, 
ice, and snacks for the day. You save the shopping time, and the club 
bills you for the goodies.
Weighing benefits and liabilities
The most obvious benefit of fractional boat ownership clubs is boating as 
often as you want and, in some clubs, with as many different boats as you 
wish. This section reviews both the benefits you should expect to enjoy and 
the risks you should consider first.
Enjoying variety and convenience
Here’s a rundown on the benefits of boat ownership clubs:
 
✓ The ability to choose from among many boat types: I’ve come across 
clubs that offer virtually all styles of boats to their members. You can 
cruise one weekend, overnighting in a port you’ve always wanted to 
visit, and when you come back, you can take out a speed boat for a 
brisk ride around your home turf. Pontoons, fishing boats, bay boats, 
and offshore boats are also commonly available in boat clubs like this.
 
✓ The ability to easily reserve time on the water: When you join a club, 
all you need to do to reserve a boat for a day or even a few days is either 
phone or, in some cases, log onto a Web reservation site and enter your 
reservation request.

328
Part V: Enjoying Your Boat  
 
✓ No launching or loading: Some clubs deliver a boat to your driveway 
for you to trailer to your destination, but many of the clubs have a home 
port that operates much like a dry-stack marina. You phone ahead for 
a launch appointment, and the boat is waiting at the waterfront for you 
when you arrive.
 
✓ No fueling, washing, or checking the oil: A big part of getting on the 
water and later stowing the boat is wrapped up in washing, waxing, 
gassing up, and checking fluids. When you’re a member of a boat 
ownership club, those tasks are done for you — your job is simply to 
turn the ignition key.
Watching out for the downside
Boat ownership clubs aren’t for everybody. The need for reservations limits 
the spontaneity that boaters often relish. And these clubs don’t carry much 
pride of ownership, so if you’re one of those folks who meticulously rubs 
out every smudge, scratch, or ding in the boat, you had better buy your 
own boat.
 
If I were contemplating joining a boat ownership club, I’d look for a trial 
membership and test it out for a few months before making a longer-term 
commitment. I’d also ask the following pointed questions of the sales 
representatives, and I recommend that you do the same:
 
✓ Does the initiation fee — or whatever the club calls the upfront fee — 
get you an official title to a share of the boats or just the right to use 
them as long as the club is in business?
 
✓ Can you sell your membership if you later decide to buy your own 
boat and quit the club?
 
✓ Are there any penalties for cancelling your membership? Are there 
any residual obligations?
 
✓ On the topic of accidents and insurance, who’s responsible for the 
deductible, and what levels of insurance are carried on the different 
boats?
 
✓ Are there any personal liabilities against which you should protect 
yourself in case of an accident?
 
✓ Who handles the cost of repairs in case of an accident? Be certain 
you’re comfortable with the limits of your liability to the club in case of 
damages.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you pick up ten tips for boating like an 
expert, the ten most important things every boater 
should carry onboard, and ten (plus a couple extra) 
surefire ways to identify a bad boat before you buy it.

Chapter 19
Ten Tactics That Separate 
Pros from Amateurs
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping a crew and passengers aware and secure
▶ Practicing proper communication
▶ Using the proper gear and knots
E
xperienced boaters adopt attitudes and know techniques that keep them 
and their passengers safer and make them look smoother at the helm 
and cleverer at the dock than newer boaters. I learned some of these things 
the hard way, but as a reader of this book, you don’t have to! In this chapter, 
I present ten insights that will help you become a more professional boater in 
no time.
Know the Limits of Your Crew
The great mutinies in naval history weren’t due to wealth, greed, or power. 
They mostly grew out of fear of and unfamiliarity with uncharted waters too 
far from home. Although your boating crew or passengers aren’t likely to 
outright mutiny against you, you don’t want to endanger their comfort or 
safety due to your inexperience or lack of wisdom as their captain.
Never plan an all-day cruise for friends new to boating if you’re not sure they 
can handle the conditions. And by conditions I mean the rocking and rolling 
and exposure to the elements. Taking someone fishing offshore for eight 
hours is fun for them only if they don’t begin hurling from seasickness two 
miles out of port. The elderly and frail may love a boat ride, but don’t plan 
on ever reaching speeds high enough to put the boat up on plane. Just a few 
hours on the water can ruin the trip for fair-skinned people without sun 
protection, and while you’re at the helm, you’re the one in control of their 
exposure to the sun.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens  
Take your responsibility to your passengers and crew seriously. For more 
details on keeping your passengers safe and how to both prevent and handle 
emergencies, turn to Chapter 12.
Give Fair Warning for Any Maneuvers
In a car, passengers have seatbelts, doors, and bucket seats to hold them in 
place. They can see the lines on the road and many other cues that let them 
know exactly which way the car will turn or whether it will go up or down a 
hill or suddenly accelerate or stop. In contrast, boating seldom offers such 
cues — unless the captain at the helm shouts them out, which can help keep 
a passenger from taking an unexpected swim.
For example, if you see the need to suddenly veer to the port side, shout it 
out so your crew can adjust themselves for the turn. The correct vernacular 
for a left turn is “Turn to port,” but you may want to call “Left turn!” to be 
crystal clear for those who don’t remember what “port” means. Add “Turning 
to port!” afterward so they can learn the lingo.
Also, if you see large wakes that you expect to shake up the boat, warn your 
crew. I just tell mine that there are “big bumps ahead.” I’d rather not sort out 
who knows the jargon and who doesn’t.
Prepare Your Crew for Docking 
and Disembarking
You wanna see something painfully funny? Go to www.youtube.com and 
type “love boat bloopers” in the search box. After watching the resulting 
short clip of boating mishaps set to the theme song from the old Love Boat 
TV show, you’ll understand why boating’s most dangerous moment is getting 
from boat to dock or dock to boat. What the video montage doesn’t show is 
how many people had to go to the emergency room for stitches or to have 
broken bones set afterward!
When you’re docking, prepare your crew for the process. Make sure your 
crew members know that, when docking your boat, you don’t need them to 
be human brakes or fenders and you don’t want them to try to guide the boat 
by hand or stop it by trying to grab the dock. Explain to them that docking 
works best if you, the captain, do it with the motor while everyone remains 
with butts firmly planted in their seats. Ask them to remain that way until you 
tell them, “You’re clear to go.”

333
 Chapter 19: Ten Tactics That Separate Pros from Amateurs
If you need help, assign each person to a task and be very specific about it. 
Be friendly, and most of all, make sure everyone understands their roles, 
whether it be to sit tight or tighten the bowline.
 
Imagine trying to dock while kids are scrambling prematurely onto the dock. 
If you didn’t see them and you overshot your approach and popped the shift 
into reverse, they could be thrown in the water and sucked in the prop blades. 
I’ve seen it almost happen — with my own crew.
Yell to Be Heard, Not to Offend
When you’re maneuvering a boat, you have to contend with engine noise, 
the rushing of the wind, and the sloshing of the water. At the dock or launch 
ramp, you also may encounter other boats making the same noises and 
people yelling the same commands as you.
Yelling to be heard is common in boating, but be careful that it doesn’t cross 
the line into yelling out of irritation or anger — or that your crew members 
don’t interpret it that way.
 
The best way to avoid potentially volatile communications in the heat of the 
moment is to discuss the boating process beforehand.
Resist the Temptation to Hot-Dog
As a kid, I worked a boat rental dock in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. There’s 
probably still a water patrolman around there somewhere who remembers 
giving me an undeservedly friendly warning to slow down as I returned my 
rental boats to the dock after taking a test drive to make sure the renters 
didn’t break them.
As a stupid kid, I used to charge the dock at full speed and chop the throttle 
at the last second, jam the boat into reverse, and stop the boat in the nick 
of time. It was fun, but if the engine died during shifting, as engines often do, 
I would have coasted hard into the dock. I’ve since learned that it’s always 
more impressive to watch a guy dock a boat precisely, quietly, and without 
theatrics.
A professional boater never uses more throttle than needed to maneuver the 
boat, especially when docking. I see hot-dogs all the time who never learned 
that lesson. I was lucky to have learned it before the inevitable ever happened.

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens  
 
The better you get at boating, the greater the temptation to hot-dog. A serious 
boater never shows off — at least not at the helm. You know what the last 
thing a hot-dog says before taking his boat to the fiberglass repair shop? 
“Watch this.”
Be Clear about Who Has the Helm
If you plan to let others drive — ahem, pilot — the boat, be sure they know 
what their responsibility is. Make sure you communicate clearly at all times 
with your crew, and don’t give the helm to others unless you’re sure they 
know what they’re doing.
I once boated with a friend who asked me to take the helm for him while he 
tidied up the boat after fishing. Moments later, he returned and asked for the 
helm. I was happy to relinquish it and went back to enjoying the scenery. 
He walked away from the helm without asking me to take over again. I was 
looking away, so nobody noticed as we eased out of the channel and ran up 
on rocks, crushing a $1,000 set of props and a $4,000 drive unit. I felt bad 
about it, thinking that I should have read his mind or understood that he 
wanted me to take the helm again. But the rest of the crew agreed that he had 
the helm at the time and was at fault.
Use Proper Docklines
I’ve spent more than 25 summers on or around boat docks, and I always 
find it amazing how many boaters buy a new boat with life jackets, fire 
extinguishers, skis, and wakeboards and then tie their boats to the dock 
with scraps of rope they cobble together from dog leashes, clotheslines, 
and whatever they find on the dock.
Want to look like a pro? When you pull into the slip with your shiny new boat 
(or pre-owned one, for that matter), reach into a locker and pull out at least 
four spiffy new nylon docklines with a loop already woven into one end (you 
can buy them like this; see Chapter 4 for more information).
 
Docklines shouldn’t be an afterthought. They’re as important to the safety 
of your boat as the drain plug. The lines should match in length so you don’t 
have to sort them to use them, and they should all be of the same diameter 
and strength. Your boat is only as secure as the weakest line on the dock.

335
 Chapter 19: Ten Tactics That Separate Pros from Amateurs
Avoid the Tangled Mess of Lines
You can tell a captain knows his or her stuff when he or she glides into a slip 
and pulls out well-kept, unknotted docklines neatly coiled and ready for use.
If you don’t spend the time coiling a line after use, much like you would an 
extension cord, the next time you need it, the line will be wrought with knots 
and tangles and you’ll be forced to spend more time untangling and untying it 
than you would have spent coiling up the line in the first place.
Every unwanted knot left in a rope soon becomes as hard as a brick and 
impossible to get out, decreasing the line’s usefulness and increasing the 
odds that the knot will break the line or chafe an ugly scab on your boat.
Tie a Bowline Knot
Boaters use many different kinds of knots for mooring their boats, towing 
other boats, or securing things in place.
If you learn to tie only one knot, it should be a bowline loop. This knot won’t 
slip out, but no matter how tight it gets, you can always get it untied. You can 
use it to hitch to a cleat or tie it through a tow-eye when pulling a boat.
 
Here’s a great way to master the bowline and remember how to tie it (I think 
I learned it in Boy Scouts). As you work this knot, say this: “The rabbit climbs 
out of the hole, runs around the tree, and then back down in the hole”:
 
1. For a 6-inch loop in a line, bend a small loop in the line (call it the 
“rabbit hole”) 18 inches from the bitter end. To do it, fold the bitter 
end (the “rabbit”) over the line (see Figure 19-1a and b). (If you want a 
smaller loop, say a 4-inch loop, use 12 inches of line.)
 
2. Bring the bitter end up through the rabbit hole (see illustrations c, 
d, and e of Figure 19-1). Pull enough of the rabbit through the rabbit 
hole to wrap around the long end of the line (the “tree”).
 
3. Wrap the rabbit around the tree just above the rabbit hole, as shown 
in illustrations f, g, and h of Figure 19-1.
 
4. Take the rabbit in your right hand and bring it under and through the 
rabbit hole (see Figure 19-1i and j).
 
5. Tighten it up.
 
 Double-check your knot against the one in Figure 19-1.

Go All the Way with a Half-Hitch Knot
If you master the bowline knot (refer to the previous section) and are up for 
another, I recommend you add the half-hitch to your knotting repertoire. 
Sometimes a loop is useless because there’s nothing to hook it over, such 
as a cleat. For example, if you want to lash your boat to a thick piling, the 
bowline doesn’t work well on the piling side of the equation.
In a case like that, the half-hitch is your knot. It’s easy to tie, it’s easy to get 
out, and it’s the perfect solution for fastening lines to pilings when mooring 
your boat.
Follow these steps to tie a half-hitch knot on a piling, and refer to Figure 19-2:

337
 Chapter 19: Ten Tactics That Separate Pros from Amateurs
 
1. Wrap the line twice around the piling, leaving 1 foot or so of the 
end of the line — called the bitter end — to work your knot (see 
Figure 19-2a and b).
 
2. Take the bitter end of the line over and around the line (see 
Figure 19-2c).
 
3. Grasp the line between your thumb and forefinger where it crosses 
the bitter end.
 
4. Fold the bitter end through the (sort of) triangular loop formed by the 
rope and the piling (see Figure 19-2d and e).
 
 That’s your first half-hitch.
 
5. Wind the end around the back of the line again, making a second loop 
(your second half-hitch, as shown in Figure 19-2f).
 
 Two half-hitches don’t make a whole hitch, but one half-hitch isn’t much 
good without the second one.
 
6. Wind the line through that second loop (see Figure 19-2g).
 
7. Tighten the knot.

Part VI: The Part of Tens  
 
If you’re tying a half-hitch on a piling and you plan to take the other end to 
a cleat to moor your boat — a bowline works fine on the cleat side, by the 
way — put the half-hitch higher on the piling than the cleat. As the boat works 
against its lines, the line won’t rub on the boat’s fiberglass as much as it would 
if the half-hitch were lower on the piling.

Ten Important Items 
to Keep Onboard
In This Chapter
▶ Carrying safety gear
▶ Storing extra parts and equipment
▶ Protecting your crew and passengers from the sun
K
eeping your ship shipshape means keeping your crew safely outfitted 
and carrying a certain amount of redundant gear onboard. Outfitting 
your boat with an extra propeller, the tools to change it, and spare equipment 
to replace what’s most commonly used and frequently broken is the mark of 
a skillful boater. I discuss most of these things in detail throughout this book, 
and this chapter gathers ten of the most vital points into a quick-reference 
checklist.
Life Jackets
You (hopefully) already know your boat can’t be legally operated without 
a life jacket available for every passenger onboard. Chances are, you bought 
one for every member of your family. But what about guests you may bring 
along on an upcoming trip? It’s way too easy to assume that because you 
were properly equipped on the last trip out, you’ll be good to go on the 
next one.
Life jackets not only have to be in adequate supply, with one for each passenger, 
but they have to properly fit the passengers, too. Keep an inventory list of life 
jackets onboard, along with their sizes. Store all the jackets in a duffel bag you 
can access conveniently before you depart from the dock.

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Clean-Up Equipment
Some people have rules about eating or drinking in a car, but I can’t imagine 
a boat’s crew standing up under such mutiny-inducing restrictions. Snacks, 
sodas, and other beverages are a part of a fun, relaxing day on the water 
(refer to Chapter 17), so be prepared to quickly clean up spills before they 
become stains.
Keep the following cleaning items conveniently onboard:
 
✓ Spray bottle of marine boat cleaner from a marine store. Don’t use 
household cleaners, because many have ammonia, which is bad for all 
parts of the boat.
 
✓ Paper towels or clean rags.
 
✓ A synthetic chamois or large sponge for sopping up spilled drinks.
 
✓ A soft scrub brush for cleaning crumbs from carpet or non-skid deck 
treads.
Extra Rope
Sooner or later, you’ll have to pitch a line to a dock hand to get your boat 
under control in an unruly current or breeze. You may need to pitch a line to 
a disabled boat to help tow it ashore, or you may just want to tie an overly 
rambunctious rug rat to his seat to keep him from falling overboard (just 
kidding on that last one).
My point is that rope is never in adequate supply on most recreational boats. 
For the cost of a couple of waterfront hamburgers, you can have 100 feet of 
line stowed safely aboard. Coil it neatly, and then drop it in a locker. You’ll be 
glad you did.
A Boat Hook
When people fall overboard on a boat, it’s usually because they lean too far 
over the gunwale (the side of the boat) to reach a line or piling or even to 
rescue a hat blown into the water.
That 12-pack of beer you and your friends are going to drink at your driveway 
boat-wash party on Saturday evening costs more than a floating, adjustable, 
aluminum boat hook. Instead of leaning over the gunwale, you can use this 
hook to safely hand a mooring line to a dock hand or pull a Dale Earnhardt #3 

341
 Chapter 20: Ten Important Items to Keep Onboard
hat from the water. Find one (a hook, not a hat) at www.westmarine.com, 
your local boat dealer, or a marine supply store.
A Backup Horn
Boat horns may be the most unreliable gizmos on boats. Few work for very 
long, and if you’re inspected by the Coasties, one of the first things they’ll 
nail you on is lacking a sound signal, thanks to a dysfunctional horn.
 
Attach a loud whistle to your ignition keys. It counts as a sound signal in a 
pinch and can save you from a ticket.
Spare Fuses
Find the fuse panel in your boat and determine the type of fuses it takes: 
cylindrical glass fuses or the spaded flat fuses popular in automobiles today. 
Skip your latte one morning and spend the money on two packages of spare 
fuses. Choose the variety packs with various amperages so you’re sure to 
have what you need when you overheat the stereo with Pink Floyd and blow 
a fuse.
Four Key Tools
Many boaters aren’t all that handy with tools, so I’m never surprised to see 
so few tool kits onboard pleasure boats. But a kit with just these four tools 
can save the day in most any boating outing:
 
✓ Screwdriver with replaceable bits: You’ve seen these screwdrivers at 
the cashier’s counter of any hardware store. It’s like a regular screw-
driver, but in place of the blade, it has a socketed shaft that accepts a 
supply of various screwdriver and fastener bits. Use this tool to tighten 
any screw you see poking its head even a millimeter above its hole.
 
✓ Pliers: Pliers can help you tighten and adjust loose battery cables, which 
are the most common cause of battery failure and a boat that won’t 
start. You’ll also need pliers to change a propeller, because many props 
use a cotter key to hold on the prop nut, and the pliers let you bend the 
cotter key straight.
 
✓ Adjustable wrench: With an adjustable wrench that’s large enough, you 
can skip bringing a propeller wrench, saving space onboard.

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ A sharp, serrated knife: With ropes onboard, sooner or later you’ll get a 
knot tied that you can’t untie. Choose a serrated knife for cutting ropes. 
Nothing works better. Many popular brands like Gerber and Buck make 
folding knives of stainless steel so they don’t rust in marine environments.
Spray Grease
Spray grease loosens rusted nuts, counteracts corrosion, and restores 
clean connections between wiring connections. Just spray it on and let it 
do its work.
 
To protect your tools from corrosion due to humid and salty air, lay them on 
a clean, old terry cloth towel and spray this grease liberally over them. Turn 
them over and spray the other side. Use the towel to rub it in, and then roll 
the tools in the rag to make sure they’re covered.
Materials to Plug Leaks
One of these days it may happen to you: You’ll notice something isn’t quite 
right when the boat comes up on plane a little slower, when water comes out 
of hatches when you slow down, or when you find just the bow of the boat 
peeking above the water like a harbor seal. You’ve sprung a leak.
Old timers carried wooden plugs of various sizes and jammed them in broken 
and leaking through-hull fittings to stop leaks. Thankfully, leak-plugging has 
advanced somewhat and wooden plugs are no longer the only solution.
 
A friend of mine, the Alaskan Coast Guard Auxiliary commodore Michael 
Folkerts, offers this suggestion: Buy a couple of wax rings used to seal your 
bathroom toilet bowl to the plumbing. If you spring a leak, you can mold the 
wax to the exact shape needed to plug it up. Add a roll of duct tape to that 
short shopping list. You can use it in a pinch to temporarily slow the leaks in 
hoses or fittings.
Sun Protection
For your kids’ sake (and your own!), leave the bimini top in place if you have 
one and get one if you don’t. Keep a generously sized bottle of waterproof 
sunscreen onboard, too. Bullfrog is my favorite brand; it was made by water 
rats for water rats, and I haven’t found a brand I like better.

S
ome people believe that all boats are horribly unreliable and poorly made. 
In truth, their engines are often the same engines used in automobiles. 
I’ve actually looked inside a Yamaha F115 outboard and seen “FORD” stamped 
on certain internal engine parts because the engine block was once used in 
a compact car. General Motors is the chief supplier of engines to the marine 
industry. Even the drive systems added by marine manufacturers are precisely 
engineered and carefully designed to ease the routine maintenance requirements 
as much as possible.
Over the course of its life, your car engine will operate at an average of only 
about 2,000 revolutions per minute (RPMs) thanks to the laws of inertia, drag, 
and the car’s ability to coast on level ground. But a boat never gets to coast 
downhill. When it reaches the intended speed, the engine must keep running 
at high RPMs to keep it there. To top it all off, much of a boat engine’s drive 
system has to operate and often live underwater. It’s not an easy place to live, 
and maintenance requirements are naturally higher.
The problem with boats is that boaters often see them as cars that run in 
water and overlook their special maintenance needs. That, in turn, means 
boats often become less reliable. This chapter focuses on some checks you 
can perform and a couple you should definitely have a mechanic perform 
before you buy a pre-owned boat. Part IV speaks in detail to many of these 
items.

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Check All the Engine Fluids
When you go to the doctor for a physical, the staff takes a variety of your 
body fluids to check as indicators of how things are working. Similarly, 
engine fluids tell the story of a boat engine’s health, and some problems can 
be diagnosed simply by looking at the oils and fluids. Chemical tests can 
reveal more hidden problems.
Following are the major engine oils and fluids to check and what you can 
determine from their conditions.
Engine oil
Oil in your new or pre-owned engine should be clear, not black. When you 
rub a drop of it between your fingers, it shouldn’t leave a sooty smear — just 
an oily one. Here’s some more detail about oil color and what the color you 
see may mean:
 
✓ Black, opaque oil may indicate that soot from the combustion of fuel 
in the engine is getting into the oil. This condition means the engine is 
extremely worn and ready for an overhaul.
 
✓ Creamy or whitish oil may be contaminated by moisture. This problem 
may be the result of improper boat winterization.
 
✓ Clear, honey-colored oil is what you want to see. But beware that the 
owner of a pre-owned boat could simply have changed the oil just before 
you arrived. An older engine is unlikely to have honey-clear oil unless 
it was recently changed, so don’t assume that the engine is in good 
shape just because the oil is fresh and clear. If all else on the engine 
looks properly maintained, chances are the owner changed the oil out of 
habit, not to hide a fault.
 
At www.enginecheckup.com, you can purchase an engine oil analysis kit 
that helps you look for troubles in the engine. By placing a drop of oil on 
various chemically treated pads, you can analyze the oil for excessive engine 
wear, poor combustion, and other problems.

345
 Chapter 21: Ten (Plus Two) Mechanical Checks for Buying a Pre-Owned Boat
Gear case oil
Gear case failure is one of the most common and most expensive major 
engine failures. Outboards and sterndrives both have gear cases.
At the bottom of the gear case is a screw that accepts either a regular screw-
driver or a hex wrench. Remove the bottom drain screw and let a drop or two 
of oil drip out onto your finger. Here’s what to look for:
 
✓ The gear case oil should be honey-clear and free of grit. Milky oil likely 
means the seals leak and let water in, requiring a repair that will cost 
several hundred dollars. It could also mean there’s major gear case 
damage, and the only way to check for that is to have a mechanic open 
up the gear case and examine it.
 
✓ The gear case drain screw plug is magnetic, and under normal use 
conditions, fine metal filings are likely to adhere to the screw. If there 
are problems with the gear case, the metal filings will be chunks ranging 
in size from gritty sand to small pebbles.
 
The first thing I recommend doing to a pre-owned boat is having a mechanic 
change the gear case seals and water pump impeller housed inside. The water 
pump impeller turns as the drive shaft turns and forces cooling water to the 
engine. It routinely needs changed every two years, so you may as well do it 
immediately when you get your boat. If you feel fairly certain the boat you’re 
looking at is the one you want, plan to do this before you conclude your 
purchase. If the mechanic opens the gear case to change the seals and pump 
and finds signs of excessive wear, you can adjust the final price for the repairs. 
If all is well, you can boat with peace of mind that you’ve headed off one of the 
major causes of engine failure until the next time the seals need changing or 
checking in a couple of years.
Hydraulic drive trim fluid
On outboards and sterndrives, the gear case needs to be trimmed up or 
down to give the propeller the proper angle of action for a smooth, efficient 
ride. You control this trimming action through a hydraulic line that requires 
adequate hydraulic fluid.

346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
On a sterndrive, the engine trim reservoir is located in the engine compartment, 
sometimes on the engine and sometimes near it. On an outboard, it’s located on 
the motor mount, against the transom (back) of the boat. The reservoir should 
be labeled “trim fluid” or something similar. Check the clear reservoir for the 
proper level of fluid. If it’s low or empty, you can assume there’s a leak in the 
system that needs repairing. Adjust your price for the boat accordingly.
Trim tab fluid
Your boat may be equipped with trim tabs that jut from the transom (rear) of 
your boat on either side of the gear case. The hydraulic fluid for these tabs is 
inside the engine compartment or bilge, and the reservoir for them is usually 
mounted near the spot on the inside of the transom opposite where the tabs 
are mounted.
Check the clear reservoir for the proper level of fluid. If it’s low or empty, 
you can assume there’s a leak in the system that needs repairing. Adjust your 
price for the boat accordingly.
Power steering fluid
The power steering fluid reservoir is mounted on the engine on sterndrive 
boats. On newer engines, the reservoir cap is yellow and easy to spot. 
Unscrew it and check the dipstick on the cap to be sure the reservoir has 
the proper level of fluid. Low levels indicate problems that need further 
examination by a mechanic.
Operate All Engine Devices
Even if the boat’s engine runs and shifts and the propeller turns, if the drive 
trim and trim tabs don’t work properly, the boat won’t run properly. So 
before you sign on the dotted line, make sure these work. Here’s how:
 
✓ Drive trim: Operating this switch, which is located on the gearshift or 
throttle, raises or lowers the drive unit. Cycle the switch and make sure 
it works. If it doesn’t, get a mechanic’s opinion on the reason.
 
✓ Trim tabs: If your prospective boat is equipped with tabs, run the 
switches on the helm station and make sure the tabs go up and down.

347
 Chapter 21: Ten (Plus Two) Mechanical Checks for Buying a Pre-Owned Boat
Check the Engine Belt
A serpentine belt is mounted between pulleys on the front of all sterndrive 
engines and on the top of some outboard engines, under the cowl. A worn 
belt may be frayed around the edges and may actually be missing chunks 
of rubber. A belt in this condition needs to be replaced before it breaks and 
results in a repair with a surprisingly high price tag.
Examine All Engine Instruments
Many auto drivers ignore the instrument panel aside from the fuel gauge 
and the speedometer. Most people don’t even know what their oil pressure 
gauges or tachometers are telling them. In boats, however, if the engine 
stops, you can’t walk to a service station for help, so you can’t afford to be so 
laissez faire about the functions of the instruments.
On boats, I’ve figured out which gauges I can ignore and which ones I should 
never ignore. Here’s what I look for to make sure the instrument panel gives 
me the proper information:
 
✓ The fuel gauge: On boats, this gauge is notoriously fickle. On pre-owned 
boats, it often malfunctions, but you won’t know if it works until you put 
fuel in the tank — and you may not want to do that until you buy the 
boat. So, reserve the right to do so just prior to finalizing the sale, and 
adjust the price if 10 gallons of fuel doesn’t nudge the meter, because it’s 
a sign that you’ll need to replace it.
 
✓ Tachometer: This dial tells you how fast the engine is running by way 
of the number of RPMs. Engine problems often are first exhibited in a 
loss of RPMs, so without a functioning tachometer, you may not even 
be aware that your engine is increasingly sick until it stops. If the 
tachometer needle doesn’t move up or down as you throttle the engine, 
it needs repairing or replacing. You should allow for that expense when 
you make an offer on the boat.
 
✓ Speedometer: On a boat, this gauge hardly ever works for long — even 
on a new boat. I’ve learned to disregard speedometers in boats and 
rely instead on my GPS unit for speed info. If the speedometer doesn’t 
work, it’s probably not worth replacing, but you could negotiate for a 
replacement anyway.
 
✓ Oil pressure gauge: This gauge tells you how well oil is circulating in 
the engine. Oil pumps rarely fail these days, so a gauge that doesn’t 
work is most likely simply a faulty gauge, not an actual oil problem. But 

348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
the consequences of being wrong in that assumption are so expensive 
that you should have a mechanic check the system if the gauge doesn’t 
function properly.
 
✓ Voltage meter: This meter tells you if the engine alternator is charging 
the battery. It should read between 12 and 14 volts. If it doesn’t, you’re 
dealing with a bad gauge, a bad alternator, or a bad connection in the 
system. Don’t ignore this. Get a mechanic to determine that it works, or 
get a repair estimate to negotiate into the offer.
Test All Electric Devices
When evaluating a boat, turn everything on and off to see if everything works. 
Here’s a list of things to operate:
 
✓ Navigation lights: Make sure the boat has red and green bow lights and 
an all-around white light. It’s unsafe and illegal to operate a boat without 
them (see Chapter 9).
 
✓ Interior lights: These lights are handy but not mandatory for operating 
a boat. Still, make sure they work.
 
✓ Dash lights: If dash lights don’t function, you can’t read your instruments 
at night. If you’re inspecting the boat in the daytime, block the sunlight 
from the dash to see if these lights operate when you turn on the 
navigation lights. Sometimes switching on the boat’s ignition turns 
them on, too.
 
✓ Stereo: Turn on the boat’s stereo system, and put your ear to each 
speaker to make sure they all work. Put a CD in the CD player disc slot 
to make sure that works as well.
 
✓ Freshwater system: If the boat has a freshwater system, examine the 
freshwater reservoir (usually found in the engine compartment) to make 
sure there’s no black mold inside. If the system is empty, fill it with 
water to make sure it’s watertight, and run the freshwater pump to be 
sure it works, too.
 
✓ Raw water pump: This device draws from the surrounding water to 
spray on the boat for rough cleanups. These pumps are notoriously 
fickle, so make sure it runs and pumps water.
 
✓ Electrical switches: Every switch should do its job. Cycle through them 
all, and double-check their functions.

349
 Chapter 21: Ten (Plus Two) Mechanical Checks for Buying a Pre-Owned Boat
Check the Drive System Alignment
In sterndrive engines, a common cause for drive system failure is misalignment 
between the sterndrive and the engine. This often happens as the boat ages 
and the engine mounts compress over time, causing the engine and sterndrive 
to shift in relationship to each other. Drive system alignment isn’t an easy 
check for an amateur, but it shouldn’t be any trouble for a mechanic. Have one 
check this alignment before you buy the boat.
Check for a Sound Deck and Hull
I once rode a brand-new boat that had a stringer system loose inside it. 
Stringers are long beams that give strength to the boat from its stern to its 
bow. As we crested each wave, you could feel the stringer knocking up and 
down between the hull and deck. The manufacturer took this boat back to 
the factory and disassembled it completely to make the repair. That’s an 
enormous job with enormous expense.
Something like a loose stringer system is extremely uncommon in new or 
pre-owned boats, but as boats age, things do begin to weaken, soften, or 
sometimes rot. Whether the boat you’re considering is new or pre-owned, 
head off potential deck and hull repairs.
 
✓ Soft spots on the deck: Take baby steps all over the deck of the boat. 
If it sags anywhere to the point that you can feel it, count on serious 
structural problems. Take the boat off your list of possibilities, or adjust 
the price after getting a repair estimate.
 
✓ Hull problems: Loose stringers or other structural problems are 
detected only by driving the boat over waves and wakes, because the 
defects often cause the boat to make cracking or thumping noises in 
such conditions. You can tell if stringers are rotting by unscrewing one 
of the engine mount bolts. If it comes out wet, or if the stringers are 
squished out of shape under the engine, the boat probably has rotting 
stringers. Drive the boat. Does it thump or creak excessively in a way 
you can feel more than hear? If so, cross it off your list and find another 
potential buy.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Ferret Out Trailer Troubles
Without a trailer, your new-to-you boat won’t be much use unless you 
plan to dock it for good at your lakeside cabin or at a marina — which are 
totally viable options. But if you’re planning to keep your boat elsewhere 
and transport it to the water when you’re ready for an outing, here are some 
common weak points to check for when purchasing a pre-owned boat trailer:
 
✓ Wheel bearings: Jack up the trailer and spin the wheels. They should 
turn smoothly and silently. If they don’t, count on having to change 
bearings and hubs — an expensive proposition. Get an estimate for this 
job, and adjust your offer accordingly.
 
✓ Lights: Hook up your tow vehicle to the trailer’s lights and make sure 
they all work. It’s unsafe and illegal to tow a trailer without proper brake 
and signal lights.
 
✓ Brakes: Check the brakes on a trailer, because it’s often hard to tell 
if they’re actually working except in an emergency stop, which you 
don’t want to try. But you can make sure the calipers aren’t excessively 
rusted, and you can check the brake fluid at the reservoir located on the 
tongue of the trailer. Just pop off the black cap with a screwdriver and 
look at the fluid level inside. A low level indicates a leak somewhere in 
the line. Get an estimate for this job, and adjust your offer accordingly.
 
✓ Tires: Oftentimes, boaters finally get around to selling their boats 
after they’ve been sitting on their trailers for at least a year (and often 
several years). Being parked for a long period of time causes trailer tires 
to delaminate. Look for signs that the boat hasn’t been moved in a while, 
such as tall grass on the outside of the wheels and dead grass under 
the boat. If it has been sitting in the same place for more than a year, 
you can bet on impending trailer tire failure. Adjust your price to 
accommodate mounting new tires.
