The Greek world
The british museum
The British Museum in London was 
inspired by classical Greek architecture. 
The first part of the building was 
completed in 1827 and the building as it 
is today gradually arose over the next 
30 years. Many of the objects in this book 
can be seen there.
The land of Greece is made up of 
mainland Greece and the numerous islands 
scattered throughout the Aegean and Adriatic 
Seas. It is a mountainous country with hot 
dry summers and rain only in winter. The 
early Greek settlements developed as 
small independent communities cut off 
from each other by the mountains and 
often competing for the best land, 
because the fertile arable soil is in short supply. Each of the city-
states which developed out of these communities had 
a strong individual identity, and citizens were very 
loyal to their home state and to its patron deity. This 
miscellaneous collection of city-states sometimes 
joined together for mutual defence and did so most 
successfully against the Persians. The Greeks 
produced a glorious culture which has had a profound 
effect on western civilization, through succeeding 
centuries to the present day. They scaled the heights 
in literature, the visual and dramatic arts, in 
philosophy and politics, in sport, and in many other 
aspects of human life. Greek civilization reached its 
peak in Athens in the fifth century b.c.
The ancient 
greek world
This map shows ancient Greece 
and the surrounding area. It 
includes towns established by 
the first emigrants from the 
mainland who travelled east. 
The emigrants settled on the 
coastal area of Asia Minor called 
Ionia. The names of the regions 
are in capitals and the cities are 
in small letters.
Kouros
Kouroi (marble statues 
of naked boys), were 
made mainly in the 
sixth century b.c. to 
decorate sanctuaries of 
the gods, especially 
Apollo, but some may 
have been put up in 
memory of young 
soldiers who had 
died in battle. They 
stand with their 
arms by their sides 
and one foot in 
front of the other.

God scent
Greece was much influenced 
by the east. This little aryballos 
(perfume pot) of a baboon was 
made by a craftsman at 
Naucratis, a Greek trading 
town in the Nile Delta in 
Egypt. In Egyptian mythology, 
Thoth, the god of wisdom, was 
represented as a baboon.
Marathon men
Athletics was a favourite pastime in 
ancient Greece (pp. 44–45). Games 
took place as part of religious 
festivals. These three runners are 
painted on a pot which was 
given as a prize to the winner of 
the race at the Panathenaic 
Games held in Athens in 
honour of Athena (pp. 16–17).
Greece and the 
wider world
This chart shows the 
rise and fall of the 
Greek world from 
Minoan times to the 
end of the Hellenistic 
period. These historic 
events can be seen 
against a background 
of other civilizations 
in Europe, Asia, and 
South America.
Acropolis
The city of Athens (pp. 16–17) was the 
most important city of ancient Greece, 
and the main centre for all forms of arts 
and learning. Its Acropolis was crowned 
with the temple of the Parthenon, 
dedicated to the goddess Athena.
Donkey drinking cup
Beautifully painted pottery 
was a speciality of the 
Greeks. It was used mainly for 
storing, mixing, serving, and 
drinking wine. This is a special 
two-handled cup in the form 
of a donkey’s head.
Hippocamp
This gold ring is 
decorated with a 
hippocamp, a sea horse 
with two forefeet and a 
body ending in the tail 
of a dolphin or a fish.

Taking the bull by the horns
The bull was regarded by the 
Minoans as a sacred animal. 
A Greek myth tells the story of the 
god Zeus falling in love with a 
beautiful princess called Europa. 
Zeus turned himself into a white 
bull and swam to Crete with her 
on his back. They had three sons, 
one of whom was Minos who 
became the king of Crete. 
Daring bull sports became a 
way of worshipping the bull. 
This bronze figure shows a 
boy somersaulting over 
the bull’s horns.
Crete
This map shows the main towns and 
palaces on the island, at Knossos, Zakro, 
Phaestus, and Mallia. A large villa has 
also been found at Hagia Triada. Most of 
the settlements were built close to the 
sea. The remains of the lavish buildings 
are evidence of the skill of Minoan 
architects, engineers, and artists. Not 
everyone lived in the palaces. Some lived 
in smaller town houses or in farmhouses 
in the country. It is said that the young 
Zeus was brought up in the Dictaean 
Cave on the high plain of Lassithi.
Bull mural
This mural at Knossos also shows 
an acrobat leaping the bull.
The first great civilization of the Aegean 
world flourished on the island of Crete. The early 
inhabitants settled as early as 6000 b.c., but the 
island reached the height of its power between 
2200 b.c. and 1450 b.c. Its wealth was due to its 
thriving trade with other Bronze Age towns in 
Greece, the Mediterranean, and in Egypt and 
Syria. Prosperity also came from the rich Cretan 
soil which produced oil, grain, and 
wine in abundance. The economy 
was based around rich palaces, the 
remains of which have been found 
in different parts of the island. This 
impressive Cretan civilization is 
known as Minoan after a 
legendary king of Crete called 
Minos. Knossos and the other 
palaces were all destroyed by fire 
around 1700 b.c., but after that 
they were rebuilt even more 
luxuriously. From then 
until about 1500 b.c., 
Minoan civilization 
was at its height.

Worshipper
This bronze figure is 
in an attitude of 
worship of the gods.
Decorating with dolphins
The walls of the Minoan palaces were richly 
decorated with painted scenes known as frescoes, 
made by applying paint to wet plaster. Many we 
see today are modern reconstructions based on 
fragments of painted plaster which have survived. 
This famous dolphin fresco is from the Queen’s 
apartment at Knossos.

Discovering knossos
English archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans 
(1851–1941) discovered the biggest and 
most famous of the Minoan palaces at 
Knossos in 1894. He dug there for several 
years and the remains of the colossal 
building with its 
hundreds of rooms 
amazed the 
world.
Theseus and the minotaur
According to Greek legend a young prince of 
Athens called Theseus went to Crete and killed 
a monster, half-man and half-bull, to whom 
Athenian children were sent as sacrifice each 
year. The monster, the Minotaur, was kept in a 
maze called the Labyrinth. It is possible that the 
huge palace at Knossos may have resembled a 
Labyrinth because of its many long and 
winding corridors.
Modern minotaur
The story of the conflict between 
Theseus and the Minotaur was 
popular not only with Greek vase 
painters but also with many 
modern artists. This interpretation 
by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso 
(1881–1973) is almost as difficult to 
unravel as the maze!
Restoration and 
reconstruction
The palace of Knossos was built and 
rebuilt several times. It was made of 
stone with wooden roofs and ceilings. 
Some parts of it were four storeys 
high. It had royal apartments 
including a throne room where the 
ruler of Knossos would sit in 
splendour. Sir Arthur Evans restored 
some of the palace so that it is 
possible to get a sense of what it was 
like when it was new. The wooden 
columns are painted the same shade 
of red as the original.

The Mycenaean civilization
Octopus jar
This pottery jar 
with a painting of 
an octopus was 
found in a cemetery 
at a Mycenaean colony 
on the island of 
Rhodes. Mycenaean artists 
were much influenced by 
Minoan work and subjects 
like this, inspired by the sea, 
continued to be popular.
Bull sprinkler
This clay bull’s head was used 
as a ritual sprinkler at 
religious ceremonies. There 
are small holes in the mouth 
to let the water escape. 
Although these sprinklers are 
sometimes in the shape of 
other animals, bulls are 
the most common.
Pomegranate pendant
This little gold pendant in the form of a 
pomegranate was found in Cyprus. It was 
made by a Mycenaean craftsman around 
1300 b.c. and is a good example of a 
jewellery technique called granulation. 
Tiny gold granules grouped in triangles 
decorate the surface of the pomegranate. 
Mycenaean artists and traders settled in 
Cyprus in large numbers. The island later 
provided a refuge for many Greeks  fleeing 
from unrest at home, as  Mycenaean 
civilization crumbled.
Greece in the bronze age (before iron tools and weapons came 
into use), had several important centres, including Mycenae. Mycenae, 
city of Agamemnon, was one of several heavily fortified strongholds. 
The king, or chief, lived in a palace with many rooms which served as a 
military headquarters and a centre of administration for the 
surrounding countryside. The Mycenaeans were warriors, and weapons 
and armour have been found in their graves. They were also great 
traders and sailed far and wide. Their civilization reached the height of 
its power in about 1600 b.c. and eclipsed the Minoan civilization of 
Crete. All seemed secure and prosperous, but around 1250 b.c. 
the Mycenaeans started to build huge defensive walls 
around all the major towns. The Mycenaean world was 
under threat from foreign invaders. By about 1200 b.c. 
the cities began to be 
abandoned or destroyed. 
Within 100 years the 
Mycenaean strongholds had 
fallen and a period often called 
the Dark Ages had begun.

11
Cuttlefish cup
Mycenaeanartists, 
including potters, 
oftenworked for 
theking and had 
their workshops 
close to the palace. 
The shape of this 
graceful drinking 
cup, with its long 
stem, wasinvented 
by the Mycenaeans. 
It is decorated with 
stylized cuttlefish.
Mask of agamemnon
Five of the royal persons buried in the shaft 
graves of Mycenae wore funeral masks of beaten 
gold. When Schliemann removed one of the 
masks, for a moment he could see the dried face 
of the corpse beneath. The mask shown here was 
thought by Schliemann to belong to 
Agamemnon, the legendary king of Mycenae at 
the time of the Trojan War. Schliemann was 
wrong, as the mask seems to have belonged to an 
earlier time, but the name persists.
Bird women
Thousands of little 
terracotta figures in the 
form of women have been 
found at Mycenaean sites. 
They have noses rather 
like beaks, and very 
prominent breasts and 
may represent a fertility 
goddess. They wear flat 
headdresses and long 
skirts and hold up 
their arms in an 
attitude of worship.
Lion gate
The city of Mycenae was the most 
powerful of the Mycenaean citiesand 
gave its name to thecivilization. It lies on 
a low hill in the northeast Peloponnese. 
The city walls, built about 1250 b.c., were 
made of huge blocks of stone. The main 
entrance to the citadel of Mycenae was 
a monumental gateway in the 
walls,wide enough for carts to pass 
through.It was decorated with the 
sculptures of two lions on either side of 
a pillar, perhaps the symbol of the 
Mycenaean royal family.
View from the past
This engraving of the Lion 
Gate is as it looked to 
19th‑century excavators, 
before they put the lions 
back in place. Probably, the 
lions had been thrown to the 
ground by an earthquake.
Grave circle
In 1876, Schliemann (pp. 12–13) excavated a royal 
burial ground at Mycenae. It consisted of a number of 
shaft graves enclosed by a low circular wall. A great deal 
of gold jewellery, which can be dated to around 1600 
b.c., was found in these graves. Their discovery 
confirmed the words of Homer who described 
Mycenae as “rich in gold”.

12
To Troy and back
In the 12th century b.c., the rich Mycenaean 
towns and palaces fell into a decline or were destroyed, 
trade with the east decreased, and Greece entered a 
dark age. During the next few centuries, stories of the 
great Mycenaean civilization which had gone before 
were handed down from one generation to the next 
in the form of poems. Two of them,The Iliad and 
The Odyssey, have survived. They reached their 
final form in the eighth century b.c. at the 
hands of the poet Homer, whose poetry was 
admired throughout the Greek world. The Iliad 
describes how a city called Troy, on the west 
coast of modern Turkey, was besieged by a 
Greek army led by King Agamemnon of 
Mycenae. It describes the heroic deeds of 
Greek and Trojan soldiers like Achilles and 
Hektor. The Odyssey tells the story of the return 
home from the Trojan War of one Greek hero, 
Odysseus. It took him ten years and he had many 
dangerous adventures. The Homeric stories reflect real 
incidents of wars, battles, and sieges from an earlier age. It 
is probable that war was waged between the Greeks and 
the Trojans, possibly over the ownership of lands and 
crops at a time when the Mycenaean world was falling 
apart, and not over the recapture of Helen (above).
Helen of troy
Helen was the beautiful 
wife of Menelaus, king 
of Sparta and brother of 
Agamemnon, king of 
Mycenae. According to 
legend, Helen’s capture 
by Paris, son of Priam, 
king of Troy, was the 
cause of the Trojan War. 
The Greeks united to 
defeat the Trojans and 
restore Helen to 
her husband.
Overcome by curiosity
Troy withstood the Greeks’ siege for ten long 
years. In the end, the Greeks triumphed by a 
trick. They constructed a huge wooden horse 
which they left just outside the city. The 
Trojans then watched the Greek army sail 
away, and overcome with curiosity, dragged 
the horse inside the city walls. Late that night, 
Greek soldiers, hidden inside the horse, crept 
out and opened the city gates. The Greek 
army, which had silently returned, entered 
and destroyed the city. This picture of the 
horse comes from a pot of about 650–600 b.c.
Modern model
In Troy today, there is a 
modern replica of the 
Trojan horse. It is very 
large and, like the 
ancient one, is made of 
wood. Children can climb 
a ladder into its 
stomach and 
pretend to be 
Greek soldiers.
The wooden horse
The story of Troy and the wooden horse has been 
a favourite with artists through the centuries. 
Italian artist Giovanni Tiepolo (1696–1770), 
painted more than one version of the subject.
Heinrich schliemann
In 1870, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann 
(1822–1890), discovered the site of ancient Troy near 
the Mediterranean coast in modern Turkey. He had 
been looking for it for many years. His excavations 
revealed not just one city, but more than  
nine of them, built on top of each other.  
(It is not certain which layer is the city  
described in The Iliad). Schliemann’s  
wife is wearing some of the  
superb jewellery found at Troy.

Helmet
Death of a hero
After the Greek champion, Achilles, 
had killed the bravest Trojan warrior, 
Hektor, he tied his body to a chariot 
and dragged it three times around the 
walls of Troy. On this clay lamp, Achilles can 
be seen driving the chariot and looking back in 
triumph. Above him, on the walls of Troy, 
Hektor’s parents, King Priam and Queen Hecuba, 
watch in horror.
Patient penelope
After his ten-year journey, Odysseus returned at last 
to Ithaca, his island home, and to his wife Penelope. 
During his long absence, she had waited patiently for 
him, even though everyone else had given him up for 
dead. When other men proposed marriage to 
Penelope, she told them that she would give them an 
answer when she had finished weaving a particular 
piece of cloth. At night, Penelope crept secretly to her 
loom, and undid everything she had woven during 
the day. In this way, she postponed indefinitely her 
reply to her suitors. In this painting by British artist 
John Stanhope (1829–1908), Penelope is sitting sadly 
beside her loom.
Mother to the rescue
The mother of Achilles was a sea nymph 
called Thetis. This little terracotta 
figurine shows Thetis, or one of her 
sisters, riding the waves on a sea 
horse, bringing a new helmet for 
Achilles to wear in battle. 
Some of the bright blue 
paint representing the 
sea, still survives.
Woolly escape
Polyphemus kept a flock of sheep in 
the cave at night and these 
provided a means of escape. 
Odysseus and his men tied 
themselves underneath the 
sheep. In the morning, the 
flock filed out of the cave to 
graze. The blind giant felt the 
backs of the sheep in case his 
captives were hiding there, but 
he did not think of feeling under 
their bellies. This story has been 
illustrated on a black-figured vase.
The blinding of 
polyphemus
In one of his adventures 
on his way home from 
the Trojan war, the hero 
Odysseus met a Cyclops called 
Polyphemus, a man–eating 
giant with only one eye in 
the middle of his forehead. 
Odysseus and his men were 
trapped in Polyphemus’ cave 
and the giant started to eat 
them one by one. Cunning 
Odysseus brought the giant a 
skin full of wine which lulled 
him into a drunken sleep. Then 
he blinded Polyphemus 
by driving a red-hot 
stake into his only eye.

Greek expansion
Fond farewell
This detail is from a large pot 
decorated in the Geometric style. The 
figures are rather rigid and painted in 
silhouette. The man on the right is 
stepping onto a boat and taking leave 
of the woman. Perhaps he is meant to 
be the hero Odysseus saying goodbye 
to his wife Penelope before he goes off 
to the Trojan War (pp. 12–13), or 
possibly he is Paris abducting Helen.
Greece started to emerge from the Dark 
Ages in the eighth century b.c. Trading posts 
began to be established abroad, even as far away 
as the Nile Delta. As the population expanded 
and Greek agriculture proved insufficient to meet 
the needs of the people, some towns sent out 
colonies both east- and westwards. They settled in 
southern Italy, Sicily, and other parts of the 
western Mediterranean, and in the east, 
around the shores of the Black Sea. 
Some of these colonies were very 
rich. It was said that the people of 
Sybaris in southern Italy slept 
on beds of rose petals, and 
roosters were banned from the 
town so that the inhabitants 
would not be woken too early 
in the morning. Greek culture 
was influenced by foreign 
styles. The Geometric style, a 
style, as its name suggests, 
dominated by geometric patterns, 
gave way to a new, so-called 
Orientalizing style. Designs influenced by 
the East such as griffins and sphinxes, were introduced. 
Egypt and Syria were the main sources. Corinth, 
Rhodes, and Ephesus were well placed for eastern 
trade and became rich.
Golden griffins
These gold griffin heads, 
inspired by the east, were found 
on the island of Rhodes. They 
were made in the seventh 
century b.c. and were once 
attached to a pair of earrings.
Man size
The Greeks liked to wear 
bangles decorated with 
animal heads. This lion­
headed bangle, which is 
silver-plated, may have 
been worn by a man.
Faience frog
At this time in Greek history, there was much 
interest in Egpytian art and the craftsman who 
made this may have been copying Egyptian work. 
It shows a man kneeling and 
holding a jar on top of which 
is a frog, a sacred creature 
in Egyptian religion. 
The object is made of 
faience, a greenish 
material often 
used to make 
Egyptian 
ornaments.
Lion aryballos
This aryballos (perfume pot), 
which probably came from 
Thebes, has a spout in the shape 
of a lion’s head. In spite of its 
small size, it has three zones of 
painted figures upon it. Warriors can 
be seen walking in procession and 
there is also a horse-race. At the 
bottom is a minute scene of 
dogs chasing hares. The 
mouth of this pot would 
have been filled with wax 
to prevent the evaporation 
of the perfume inside.
Exotic exports
Many little perfume pots were made in 
the town of Corinth and exported all 
over the Greek world. They are often 
in curious shapes and prettily 
decorated. This one has a winged 
figure painted on it who may 
represent a god of the wind.

Grooming
These four Geometric style clay 
horses form the handle of a lid of a 
pyxis, a pot in which women kept 
their cosmetics and combs. 
Compared with the perfectly 
formed horses of later Greek art 
they seem a little crude at first, 
but they have a liveliness about 
them which can also be seen in 
the bronzework of this period.
Prickly perfume
This aryballos, in the form of a hedgehog, 
was found in a Greek trading colony at 
Naucratis in the Nile Delta.
Greek colonization
The new colonies were established in places with good 
harbours and agricultural land. The process of colonization 
started as early as 750 b.c. and continued to about 550 b.c. 
These new colonies soon became independent of their mother 
cities in Greece.

Athens, city of Athena
Athens was the most powerful of all the Greek 
city-states. It was also a great centre of the arts and 
learning. Its patron Athena was goddess of wisdom 
and warfare and perfectly symbolized the two sides of 
her city’s life. In 480 b.c., Athens was attacked by the 
Persians and the temples on the Acropolis were 
destroyed. Later, when Athens had played a 
leading role in the Persian wars (pp. 54–55) and 
successfully defended Greece, a huge rebuilding 
programme was launched by the leader of Athens, 
Perikles (pp. 18–19). Athens was situated in an area 
called Attica and was more densely populated than 
other Greek cities. The people of Athens lived on the 
land below the Acropolis. Many fine public 
squares and colonnaded buildings have 
been found there around the agora, an 
open space for meeting 
and commercial activity. 
Nearby was the port of 
Athens, the Piraeus. 
Access to the sea was a 
main reason for 
Athens’ miltary and 
economic successes.
The acropolis
In early times, the Acropolis 
(high city) of Athens was a 
fortified citadel. Later, it 
became the most sacred part 
of the town where many 
important temples and 
sanctuaries were situated.
Sacred statue
The purpose of the procession 
shown on the frieze was to 
bring a new dress for a sacred 
wooden statue of Athena, 
which stood on the Acropolis. 
The dress, a woven peplos 
(pp. 42–43), is being handed 
to a priest.
The parthenon frieze
The marble frieze of the Parthenon went around all four 
sides of the temple and was set up high, on the outside of 
the central chambers near the ceiling of the colonnade.
Its main subject was the procession of worshippers which wound its 
way up from the agora to the Acropolis every four years as a part of the 
festival called the Great Panathenaea in honour of the goddess 
Athena. Young men on horseback take up much of the frieze.
The erechtheion
A smaller temple than the Parthenon, the 
Erechtheion, called after a legendary king of 
Athens, probably housed the wooden 
statue of Athena. Its famous porch has 
marble statues of women (caryatids) 
instead of columns, holding up the roof.

17
Some young men are trotting gently along and others are 
galloping with their cloaks flying out behind them. The 
background to the frieze was originally painted, probably a 
bright blue. The horses used to have bridles of bronze.
The bridles have not survived, leaving only traces of the holes 
where they were attached to the marble. In the south frieze a 
number of young cows can be seen. In other parts of the frieze 
are women carrying sacrificial vessels, bowls, and jugs.
The elgin marbles
Many of the sculptures 
from the Parthenon were 
brought to England by 
Lord Elgin, the British 
ambassador to the 
Ottoman court. He saw 
the sculptures when he 
visited Athens and was 
granted permission to 
bring some back to 
England. They can 
be seen today in the 
British Museum.

Golden goddess
Inside the Parthenon stood a huge gold and ivory statue 
of the goddess Athena, made by the famous sculptor 
Pheidias, a close friend of Perikles. She appears in all 
her splendour as goddess of warfare. In this replica 
based on a smaller copy of the original statue and 
on descriptions by Greek writers, she wears her 
aegis, a small goatskin cloak fringed with 
snakes, and a high-crested helmet. On her 
right hand is a small winged figure of Nike, 
the goddess of victory.

coin showing 
an owl, the bird 
of Athena
The parthenon
The temple of the Parthenon 
occupies the highest point of 
the Acropolis. It was dedicated 
to Athena. The word Parthenon 
comes from the Greek word 
parthenos meaning virgin. 
Athena was sometimes 
described as Athena Parthenos. 
The Parthenon, which still 
stands today, was built between 
447 and 432 b.c. The sculptures 
which decorated it were 
designed by Pheidias.

18
Power and politics in Athens
Ancient Greece was made up of a number of 
independent city-states. There were very few rich 
people and a great number of poor. In early times, 
the rich landowners and leaders called tyrants 
controlled the poor. In Athens and some other 
city-states the tyrants were driven out by the 
people, who acquired power and freedom. This 
new form of government was called democracy. 
It was invented in Athens. The Assembly 
was the main forum of political life. Meetings 
took place on a hill called the Pnyx near the 
Acropolis. Ordinary citizens, rich or poor, 
could make a speech and vote at the 
Assembly. At least 6,000 people had to 
be present for a meeting to take place. 
The Assembly made important 
decisions, for example, whether or 
not to declare war. A higher 
government body was a Council of 
500 members, which arranged 
the business for the Assembly. It 
met in a round building called 
the tholos. In times of war, decisions were made about 
the defence of the city by a group of 
ten military commanders called 
strategoi. These were elected 
annually and could be re-elected 
many times.
Solon
Solon was an aristocrat and 
law-giver who lived in 
Athens between 640 and 
558 b.c. At that time many 
Athenian farmers were very 
poor and were sold into 
slavery when they failed to 
meet their debts. Solon 
passed new laws abolishing 
debt slavery and 
introducing the right of 
appeal into Athenian law.
Perikles
Perikles was an Athenian statesman and 
general. A powerful orator, he was elected 
strategos every year from 443 to 429 b.c. 
Athens prospered under his rule, and he 
was responsible for the re-building of the 
Acropolis after its destruction during the 
Persian wars (490s and ‘80s b.c.). On this 
Roman copy of a Greek bust of Perikles, his 
name has been inscribed in Greek.
Boot boy
This little bronze figure is of an African 
boy holding a shoe. Athenian society 
depended on slaves. Some were prisoners 
of war and some foreigners bought from slave 
traders. Most of the housework in wealthy 
Athenian homes was done by slaves. Other heavy 
work, such as working in the silver mines in 
southern Attica, was also done by slaves. A few 
slaves might receive wages from their masters and 
be able to buy back their freedom. Others, such as 
the tutors employed to teach the sons of rich 
families, may have been treated with respect, but 
most slaves probably led lives of drudgery.
Palace of westminster
Many modern governments have been strongly influenced 
by the democratic system which developed in Athens in 
the fifth century b.c. The word democracy is Greek and it 
means “power of the people”. It was not, however, a 
democracy as the term is used today, because a sizeable 
chunk of Greek society including women, foreigners, and 
slaves did not have the vote.

19
Anti-tyranny law
The inscription on this stele (upright stone slab) 
outlines the Athenian law against tyranny, which 
was introduced by Eucrates in 336 b.c. Eucrates’ 
law was just one of several decrees passed by the 
Assembly which were designed to protect the 
democratic govenment of Athens.
The decree is carved with 
the letters in a grid 
pattern, with no spaces 
between words – a style 
called stoichedon
The carved figures at 
the top represent 
Democracy crowning 
the Athenian People
Judgment tablet
This oblong tablet contains a treaty 
between the cities of Oiantheia and 
Chaleion. The two sides agreed that 
there should be a legal process for 
solving disputes about the ownership of 
land, with penalties if the treaty was 
broken by either side.
It is rare to find Greek 
inscriptions on bronze: usually 
they were carved in stone
Exile of 
themistokles
This coin shows 
an Athenian 
leader, 
Themistokles, 
whose main 
achievement was the 
creation of the fleet 
which enabled the 
Greeks to destroy the 
Persians at the battle of Salamis in 
480 b.c. (pp. 54–55). Later, he was ostracised 
(banished) from Athens. When citizens wished to 
banish a politician, they would write his name on 
a piece of pot, an ostrakon, and these were 
counted. If more than 6,000 votes were cast he 
had to leave Athens for ten years.
Treasury of triumph
The battle of Marathon was a famous 
victory by the Greeks over the Persians 
in 490 b.c. Soon afterwards this fine 
marble building was erected at 
Delphi by the Athenians as a 
symbol of triumph. It was a 
Treasury, full of Persian spoils, 
an expression of the prestige 
of Athens, and also a religious 
offering to Apollo at his holiest 
sanctuary. It stands in a 
prominent position beside 
the Sacred Way which winds 
up to the temple. This 
Treasury is a vivid illustration 
of the close links which 
existed between religion 
and politics in the ancient 
Greek world.

20
Beauty and the beast
On this mirror case, the goddess Aphrodite is 
playing a game of knucklebones (pp. 34–35) with 
the god Pan. The goddess of love and beauty is often 
shown by artists as a graceful, young woman with the 
upper part of her body bare. She is accompanied by Eros 
(according to some myths, her son), shown here as a small, 
wiged boy, and also a goose, a symbol associated with her. Pan 
was a god of the countryside and had goat’s legs and ears.
Goddess of love
This bronze head of Aphrodite comes 
from eastern Turkey. The goddess was 
born from the sea foam and is 
thought to have been carried by the 
Zephyrs (West Winds) to Cyprus. 
Although she was married to 
Hephaistos, she fell in love with Ares, 
the god of war.
The king of the gods
Zeus was the king of the 
gods. He usually appears 
in art as a strong, middle­
aged, bearded man, of 
great power and dignity. 
Sometimes he carries his 
symbol, a thunderbolt.
Gods, goddesses, and heroes
Dionysos from delos
Dionysos was the god of 
wine and earth fertility. 
In this mosaic from the 
island of Delos, he is 
riding a tiger.
Home of the gods
Mount Olympus is the highest 
mountain in Greece and was 
believed to be the home of the 
gods. It is in the north of 
Greece, on the borders of 
Thessaly and Macedonia.
The greeks believed that all the gods were 
descendants of Gaia (the earth) and Uranos (the 
sky). They thought the gods were probably very 
like humans: they fell in love with each other, 
married, quarrelled, had children, played music, and 
in many other ways mirrored human characteristics 
(or humans mirrored theirs). All the gods had their 
own spheres of influence. Demeter and 
Persephone were responsible for the 
grain growing, Artemis was the goddess 
of hunting, Apollo could foretell the 
future, and Aphrodite was the 
goddess of love. Many of the best-
known gods had temples and 
sanctuaries dedicated to them, and much money and artistic 
ability were lavished upon them. Religion played a large part in 
the lives of ordinary people. Indeed, most of the beautiful 
buildings which still survive are temples. Worshippers 
believed that the gods would treat them well 
and meet their needs if they offered 
them the fruits of the harvest and 
animal sacrifices.

Brain child
The strange birth of Athena 
was a favourite subject for 
Greek vase painters. She 
was the daughter of 
Zeus by the goddess 
Metis, meaning 
wisdom. Zeus was 
told that any son 
born to Metis would be 
more powerful than its father, 
and so, hoping to prevent 
this, he swallowed Metis. 
Soon afterwards, Zeus was 
siezed by fierce pains in his 
head. He ordered the god 
Hephaistos to cut it open, and 
Athena emerged.
Apollo and 
Daphne by 
Italian artist 
Antonio del 
Pollaiuolo 
(1432–1498)
Apollo and daphne
Daphne was a nymph 
loved by Apollo. According 
to one myth he tried to 
seize her, but she escaped. 
In answer to her prayer, 
Zeus turned her into a 
laurel tree, ironically, 
the tree sacred 
to Apollo.
Hephaistos
The lame god 
Hephaistos, who was a 
smith, made a special 
axe to cut open Zeus’ 
head. He also made a 
throne and shield for the 
king of the gods. He was 
the god of fire and 
husband of Aphrodite.
Apollo
Apollo, a 
beautiful young 
deity, was the twin 
brother of Artemis, 
the goddess of the 
hunt. He had a 
famous shrine and 
oracle at Delphi. He 
is associated with the 
sun, with light, and 
with healing and 
medicine.
Athena
Athena was the patron 
goddess of the city of 
Athens. She was also the 
goddess of wisdom and 
warfare, and presided over 
the arts, literature, and 
philosophy. Her favourite 
bird was the owl and her 
favourite plant the olive tree, 
which she is credited with 
introducing to Athens. In the 
Trojan war (pp. 12–13) she fought 
on the side of the Greeks, and 
assisted Odysseus in his 
long voyage home.
Demeter and persephone
Demeter and Persephone were mother 
and daughter and goddesses of the 
grain. This terracotta figure shows 
them sitting side-by-side wearing 
headdresses. They were probably 
holding the reins of an ox-cart which 
has not survived the years.

The faun
In this painting by the Italian artist 
Piero di Cosimo (1462–1521), a woman 
lies dead, mourned by a faun and a dog. 
Fauns were identified with the god Pan, 
who was the protector of shepherds and 
their flocks.
Eros and 
psyche
Greek myths 
were a mixture of 
stories about gods and 
heroes. The stories grew with the 
telling, and there were many different 
accounts of them. Gods and heroes 
gained or lost popularity at different 
periods of Greek history. This 
Hellenistic terracotta shows Eros, the 
god who makes people fall in love, 
kissing Psyche, the goddess who 
represents the soul. To the ancient 
Greeks, their embrace symbolized 
perfect happiness.
Herakles
The greatest hero of all, Herakles, was the son of Zeus by a 
mortal woman. As a tiny baby Herakles proved he was a hero 
by strangling with his bare hands two snakes sent to attack 
him. In adult life, Herakles performed twelve famous Labours 
(tasks) for a king called Eurystheus. In the first Labour, 
Herakles killed the Nemean lion, and is often shown, 
as on this vase, wearing its skin. The Labour shown 
here is the killing of the Stymphalian birds. These birds, 
which lived near a lake in the 
northea st Peloponnese, 
destroyed crops and 
wounded people with their 
poisonous feathers. Herakles 
scared them with a bronze 
rattle, given to him by the 
smith god Hephaistos 
(pp. 20–21), and then shot 
them with a sling. Herakles 
was strong and courageous 
but he liked wine and women 
and had many love affairs.

23
Lure of the lyre
Orpheus was a poet and a musician. He played the lyre and 
the kithara and sang so well that he could tame wild 
animals; trees and plants would bend their branches to 
him, and he could soothe the most violent of tempers. He 
took part in the expedition of Jason and the Argonauts and 
calmed the crew and stilled the waves with his music. In 
this beautiful painting by Dutch painter Roelandt Savery 
(1576–1639), the magic of Orpheus’ music is illustrated. 
All the birds and beasts are lying down together in an 
enchanted landscape.
Perseus and medusa
On this vase painting of 460 b.c., the hero Perseus has just 
cut off the head of the gorgon Medusa. One gaze from 
Medusa could turn a person to stone which is why Perseus 
beheaded her. Her head can be seen in Perseus’ bag.
The building of the argo
This Roman terracotta wall panel shows a scene from the famous myth of Jason and 
the Argonauts. Jason was a prince from Thessaly in northern Greece and the 
Argonauts were a group of heroes who sailed with him on a ship they had built 
called the Argo. Heroes often battled with strange monsters, and often undertook 
long and difficult journeys. Jason and his crew set sail to find the Golden Fleece 
which hung on a tree near the Black Sea, guarded by a snake. The goddess 
Athena helped Jason in this task and she can be seen on the left helping the crew 
to construct the Argo.
Too high!
Icarus was the 
son of Daedalus, a 
mythical craftsman 
who made wings 
for himself and his 
son, to enable 
them to fly. Their 
wings were 
attached by wax. 
Icarus flew too 
high, the heat of 
the sun melted 
the wax, and he 
fell into the 
Aegean Sea 
and drowned.
Pegasus
This coin shows 
the winged horse 
Pegasus. Pegasus was 
tamed by the hero 
Bellerophon who tried to 
ride him to heaven. But 
Pegasus was stung by a 
gadfly sent by Zeus and 
threw Bellerophon off his 
back and down to earth.

24
Festivals and oracles
Religion played a major part in Greek life. Greek worship 
centered around a small altar at home, usually in the courtyard 
of the house. The Greeks believed that they could strike a 
bargain with the gods. They offered them gold, silver, and 
animal sacrifice. They also held festivals and games in their 
honour. In return, they expected the gods to protect them from 
illness, look after their crops, and grant other favours. Communication with the 
gods had a regular place in the calendar; most festivals took place once a year, or 
sometimes every four years. Gods were also worshipped in sanctuaries – 
one of the most important was that of Apollo at Delphi. Apollo was 
well-known as a god of prophecy, and at Delphi he would reply to 
questions about the future. His priestess would act as the 
mouthpiece of the god and make obscure 
pronouncements which could be interpreted in 
different ways. The oracle (as these forecasts were 
called) at Delphi, lasted into Christian times.
Come dancing
A row of people join hands and approach an 
altar where a sacrifice is blazing, at a festival 
in the countryside. A priestess, or perhaps 
Demeter, the corn goddess, stands behind 
the altar with a flat basket used for 
winnowing grain.
Holy bull
A bull was one of the animals offered at important 
sacrificial occasions. Bulls would be decorated with 
garlands of plants and ribbons to show that they 
had been set aside for the gods. Garlanded bulls’ 
heads were the inspiration for some of the 
decorative patterns on temples.
Something old, 
something new
The huge columns 
of a Greek temple at 
ancient Poseidonia 
(Paestum) in 
southern Italy frame 
a bride and groom 
posing for their 
wedding photos. 
Ancient ruins like 
these are believed to 
bring good luck to a 
new marriage.
Centre of the world
Delphi was thought to be the centre of the 
world, at the very point where two birds flying 
from opposite ends of the earth met. The Greeks 
placed a huge stone there, the omphalos, or navel 
of the world. Carved on this version, which is in the 
museum at Delphi, is a network of woollen strands. These 
were a sign that this was a holy object.

Procession of sacrifice
On this broad bowl used for wine (the ivy leaves 
which decorate it are linked with Dionysos, the wine 
god), a long line of people are on their way to 
worship the goddess Athena. The altar where the 
flames are already rising is on the right of the bowl. 
Athena is standing behind the altar. The procession is 
led by a woman carrying a tray of cakes on her head. 
She is followed by a man leading the sacrificial bull, 
then a man playing the double pipes. The 
rest of the men in the procession 
carry all the objects necessary 
for the worship of the 
goddess, such as a 
jug of wine. 
A mule cart 
brings up 
the rear.
The way to athena
In the goddess Athena’s own city of 
Athens lay the Panathenaic Way, a 
special road that led up to her 
temples and altars on the Acropolis. 
Leading up from the agora, the 
market and meeting place of the 
city, the road today passes the 
rebuilt version of a stoa, a long, 
colonnaded building. It was used for 
commerce and conversation.
Sanctuary of athena
The sanctuary of Athena lies further down the 
mountain from Apollo’s shrine. In the middle of it 
is this circular building, the purpose of which is 
unknown. It is set against the silvery blue 
background of thousands of olive trees. Athena 
was supposed to have created the olive tree, 
and these groves still provide a rich 
harvest for local people.
Temple of apollo
Delphi was the home of the main shrine of Apollo. It 
lies on the steep slopes of Mount Parnassus, the 
favourite haunt of Apollo and also of the Muses who 
looked after arts and music. A road lined with small 
buildings to house the rich gifts made to the god, still 
winds its way up the slope and past the remains of his 
great temple which housed the oracle.
The charioteer
A stadium was built high above the temple to Apollo 
at Delphi, for games and chariot races in honour of 
the god. Winning the chariot race was the greatest 
honour of the games, and the owner of the 
winning team of horses paid for a statue to 
celebrate his success. The eyes of this 
magnificent bronze statue are inlaid 
with glass and stone, the lips are 
copper, and the headband is 
patterned with silver. The 
charioteer is still holding the 
reins of his horses even though 
they have long disappeared. 
This is perhaps one of the best-
known statues of ancient Greece.

26
Temples
Greek life was dominated by religion and so it is not 
surprising that the temples of ancient Greece were the biggest 
and most beautiful buildings. They also had a political purpose 
as they were often built to celebrate civic power and pride, or to 
offer thanksgiving to the patron deity of a city for success in war. 
Temples were made of limestone or marble with roofs and 
ceilings of wood. Roof tiles were made of terracotta or stone. 
Large numbers of workers must have been employed in temple 
construction. Huge stone blocks had to be transported from 
quarries in ox-drawn carts. These blocks were carved on site by 
masons using hammers and mallets. The tall columns were 
made in cylindrical sections (“drums”), lifted into position with 
ropes and pulleys, and held together 
with pegs. Decorative sculpture in the 
form of friezes, and statues in the 
pediments (the triangular gable ends), 
added to the grandeur and beauty of 
Greek temples.
Zeus’ temple
A great international festival 
of athletics (pp. 44–45) in 
honour of Zeus was held 
every four years at Olympia, 
a sanctuary on the banks of 
the river Alpheios. Colossal 
remains of the great temple 
of Zeus built in the fifth 
century, and other 
important buildings, have 
been found there.
Cape sounion
A fifth-century marble temple to 
Poseidon, god of the sea, crowns a high 
promontory south of Athens. It was a 
landmark for sailors returning home to 
Athens. The English romantic poet Lord 
Byron (1788–1824) was very moved by 
its beauty.
Temple of ceres
Poseidonia (later called Paestum) in southern Italy, south of Naples, was a rich Greek 
colony and it has the best preserved archaic temples anywhere in the Greek world. This 
one, built in the sixth century b.c. in the Doric style and known as the temple of Ceres 
(the Roman version of Demeter), was in fact dedicated to the goddess Athena 
and later used as a Christian church. For hundreds of years few people 
visited the site of Paestum because it was hidden by swamps and 
undergrowth, and this accounts for the remarkable 
survival of the buildings.

27
Lotus leaves
This marble fragment is crisply 
carved with a frieze of lotus and 
palmette designs and other 
delicate mouldings. It comes 
from the top part of the east wall 
of the famous temple of the 
Erechtheion on the Acropolis of 
Athens (pp. 16–17). The roof of 
the south porch of the building is 
supported by columns in the form 
of standing women with baskets 
on their heads. Perikles ordered 
the construction of the 
Erechtheion (which survives today 
on the site of older buildings) in 
the mid fifth century b.c. to 
beautify the city of Athens.
Corinthian capital
This Corinthian capital once 
decorated a gracious colonnaded 
building in Asia Minor (modern 
Turkey). The face is a version of a 
female theatrical mask. The 
deeply carved leaves below copy 
those of the acanthus plant, a 
favourite motif of Greek artists. The 
plant is easily identified by its 
spreading, leathery leaves.
Palmette roof tile
The end of this roof tile is decorated 
with a palmette shape. It comes from 
a temple to Apollo at Bassae in 
southern Greece. This area was 
famous for its fighting men and 
Apollo may have been worshipped 
here as a god of soldiers.
Columns and capitals
Most Greek buildings had vertical columns and horizontal lintels (beams). 
This style of construction may have been inspired by earlier wooden 
buildings whose roofs were supported by tree trunks.
Doric
The Doric style is 
rather sturdy and its 
top (the capital), is 
plain. This style was 
used in mainland 
Greece and the 
colonies in southern 
Italy and Sicily.
Ionic
The Ionic style is 
thinner and more 
elegant. Its capital is 
decorated with a scroll­
like design (a volute). 
This style was found in 
eastern Greece and 
the islands.
Corinthian
The Corinthian style is 
seldom used in the 
Greek world, but often 
seen on Roman 
temples. Its capital is 
very elaborate and 
decorated with 
acanthus leaves.
Lion’s mouth
Rain water was sometimes drained away from the roofs 
of temples through spouts in the form of lions’ heads. 
This one comes from a temple of Athena at Priene, just 
south of Ephesus, in modern Turkey.
Rosette capital
This huge marble capital 
(top of a column) comes from the 
temple of Artemis at Ephesus in modern Turkey. An earlier 
temple on the same site was destroyed by fire in 356 b.c., on the 
same night that Alexander the Great (pp. 62–63) was born.

At home
The Greeks liked their homes to be private. The windows were 
small and set high in the walls, which were made out of sun-dried mud 
bricks and did not survive well. This farmhouse is a fairly simple 
building and town houses would probably have had more rooms and 
been more luxurious. The garden or courtyard was in the middle of the 
house with all the rooms arranged around it. There might be a well here 
where slave girls did the family washing and filled the water pots. 
In the porch, a herm, a statue of the god Hermes, prevented 
evil spirits from entering. It is difficult to get a very clear 
picture of a typical Greek home. This farmhouse is based 
on information gathered from excavating a house in 
the country to the south of Athens, which 
was occupied in the fourth 
century b.c.
Doors and jars
Wood was 
expensive in Greece 
and doors were 
therefore precious 
objects. Two bowls 
on stands used in 
wedding rituals can 
be seen in front.
Ladder

Every house 
had an altar 
where the 
family would 
offer sacrifices 
to the gods
Terracotta

Rain cat
Some rich houses 
had gutters on the 
roofs for the removal of 
rain water. The water flowed 
onto the ground through 
water spouts like this attractive 
one shaped like a lion’s head.
Hearth for cooking

Women’s world
Whorl
The lives of women in ancient Greece were 
restricted. They were very much under the control of 
their husbands, fathers, or brothers, and rarely took part 
in politics or any form of public life. Most women could 
not inherit property and were allowed very little money. A 
girl would marry very young, at the age of 13 or 14, and her 
husband, who was certain to be much older, was chosen for her 
by her father. The main purpose of marriage was to have a baby, 
preferably a boy, to carry on the male line. The status of a woman 
greatly increased when she had given birth to a boy (pp. 32–33). 
Some marriages seem to have been happy. A number 
of tombstones have survived that commemorate 
women who had died in childbirth. There are tender 
inscriptions from the grieving husbands. It is possible 
that, although legally they had very little freedom, some 
women could make important decisions about family 
life. Their spinning and weaving work also made an 
important contribution to the household.

British artist Sir 
Lawrence Alma-
Tadema (1836–1912)
Spinner
On this white-ground jug a 
woman is spinning with both a 
distaff and spindle. The distaff 
was a shaft of wood or metal 
with a spike at one end and a 
handle at the other.
Well women
In Athens there were public fountains where 
women and slave girls went to fill their water pots. 
Not many houses had their own private wells. The 
water spout is in the shape of a lion’s head. The 
women stand waiting their turn with their water pots 
balanced on their heads. This was a good opportunity 
to meet with friends and chat.
Home makers
Girls in Greece did not go 
to school (pp. 32–33). 
Instead, they stayed at 
home and were taught by 
their mothers how to spin 
and weave and look after 
the house. Some 
wealthier women 
might be taught to 
read and write. On 
this vase a woman is 
reading from a 
papyrus scroll.
Spindle
Wool was spun into yarn 
with a spindle. This one is 
made of wood, but bronze 
and bone examples also 
exist. At one end is a 
weight, known as a 
spindle whorl. The 
spindle twirls 
around and 
spins the 
wool fibre 
into thread.

31
Entertainers
Respectable women were expected to stay at home as much as possible, 
keeping house, and supervising the slaves. Only women called hetairai were 
allowed to attend the symposia, (banquets, pp. 36–37), an important part of 
Greek social life. Hetairai can be seen on vases playing the pipes, dancing, 
and generally entertaining the male banqueters. Many hetairai were 
foreigners, and prisoners taken in wars.

burning on the 
tables in front of 
the diners were 
used to light

Beauty aid
Wealthy women owned 
many aids to beauty. This 
bronze mirror has a stand 
in the form of a goddess, 
probably Aphrodite, 
holding a dove. Two little 
cupid figures fly on 
either side of her. This 
mirror would have been 
highly polished when 
new, so that it was 
possible for its owner to 
see her reflection in it. 
Caskets, combs, and 
perfume bottles have 
also been found in 
large numbers.
Sappho
A woman 
writer of the 
late seventh 
century b.c. 
called Sappho, 
lived on the island 
of Lesbos in the eastern 
Aegean. Women in this 
part of Greece seem to have 
had more freedom than the 
women of Athens, and 
Sappho’s beautiful poems give 
us a glimpse of their lives and 
their feelings.
Thigh protector
Spinning and weaving were 
regarded as suitable 
occupations for all Greek 
women, even those of noble 
families. In preparing the 
wool for spinning, a woman 
fitted a special instrument 
called an epinetron over her 
knee. She then rolled the 
wool across the surface of it 
and drew it out, producing 
thin skeins of wool.
This epinetron has a 
scene of spinning 
and weaving 
painted upon it 
in the black 
figure

Potty training
A Greek vase shows a 
scene of a little boy 
sitting in a potty, 
which also seems to 
double as a highchair. 
A potty like this was 
found in excavations of 
the market place 
(agora) in Athens.

ancient potty
Growing up in Greece
The future of a baby rested entirely in the hands of its 
father. When a baby was born, the mother handed it to the 
father who could decide whether or not to let it live. If the baby 
was a girl or not strong, or if the family could not afford to keep 
it, the father might decide to abandon it. Then the baby would 
be left in the open air to die. Some abandoned babies were 
saved by other families and brought up as slaves. However, once 
a baby had been formally accepted by its family and named on 
the tenth day after its birth, he or she was treated kindly. Many 
toys have been found and writers tell of games like Blind Man’s 
Buff. In Athens, and most other Greek towns, boys went to 
school from about the age of seven. Girls did not go to school. 
At about the age of 12 or 13, children were considered to be 
young adults and would then dedicate their toys to the god 
Apollo and the goddess Artemis, as a sign that they had 
reached the end of childhood.

A painting on a tiny wine jug shows two 
little boys pulling their friend along in a 
wooden go-cart. Sometimes the carts were 
pulled by goats. At the Anthesteria, the 
wine festival in Athens, jugs like these were 
given as presents to boys when they 
reached three years of age. They were a sign 
that babyhood had been left behind.
Girl’s grave
This dignified terracotta doll 
sitting in a high-backed chair, 
was found in the tomb of a little 
girl. The doll probably represents 
the woman the parents of the 
girl hoped she would grow up 
to be. With the doll are other 
miniature clay objects, also 
signs of maturity.

Education

Minder
Boys from wealthy families were taken to school by a slave called a 
paidogogos, who, on this vase, sits behind the pupil holding a long staff. 
The boy stands in front of his teacher who reads from a papyrus scroll.
Training for war
Traditionally, boys needed to be fit and 
strong so that they would grow up to be 
good soldiers. Therefore, there were special 
teachers of physical exercise called 
paidotribai (paidotribes in the singular). 
Paidotribai taught their pupils athletics and 
wrestling in the palaistra. This was a long 
low building with dressing rooms and a 
colonnaded courtyard covered with sand. 
Most Greek towns had a palaistra.
Clay company
Toys for children were often made of wood or 
fabric and have not survived. Children also played 
with clay figurines, perhaps made by potters with 
left-over clay. These riders were modelled by 
hand, brightly painted and then placed in the 
graves of children to keep them company in 
the afterlife.
When boys went to school at seven, they 
learned reading, writing, and arithmetic 
from a teacher called a grammatistes. They 
learned music, including the playing of 
a musical instrument, from a teacher 
known as a kitharistes. They also had 
to learn poetry by heart and the artof 
debating. Older boys might be 
taught by teachers called 
Sophists. Sophists travelled 
from town to town and often 
taught their students in the 
gymnasia, or training 
grounds. Although girls 
did not go to school, 
some girls from well-off 
families had private 
tutors and they too 
learned to read and 
write. Their mothers 
taught them 
spinning and 
weaving, 
and how to 
run a home.
Wax scratcher
Wooden tablets covered in 
wax were used in the 
classroom. Letters were formed 
in the softened wax with a 
stylus, usually made of bone or 
metal. The blunt end was used for 
smoothing out mistakes.

34
Dancing girl
This slave girl, wearing 
a short, pleated skirt, is 
dancing while playing 
the castanets. She is 
probably an entertainer 
at a party.
Fun and games
Tuneful trio
This painting from a red figure 
vase, shows three people with 
their musical instruments. The 
woman sitting on the chair is the 
Muse Terpsichore. Muses were 
minor deities who looked after all 
the arts. Terpsichore seems to 
be concentrating hard on 
playing her harp, while 
theother two hold their 
lyresand listen. The man 
onthe right is Musaios, a 
legendary musician.
Clash Of cymbals
This pair of bronze cymbals is 
inscribed with their owner’s 
name, Oata. Musical 
instruments like this have 
survived very rarely, although 
they can often be seen on 
vase paintings.
Knucklebones
Large lyre
The kithara, which this 
woman is playing, is a larger, 
wooden version of the lyre. 
She is plucking the strings 
with a plectrum, similar to 
those used by guitarists today. The 
kithara was usually played by 
professional musicians. This figure was 
made in a Greek town in southern Italy. 
Perhaps she is singing or chanting poetry 
while she plays.
Rich Greeks, especially those who lived in towns, 
had plenty of leisure time to spend talking, giving 
dinner parties, visiting the gymnasium, and playing all 
kinds of games. Music was particularly important. Greeks 
sang songs at births, weddings, and funerals. They had 
love songs, battle songs, drinking songs, and songs of 
thanksgiving to the gods to celebrate the harvest. 
There were also many musical instruments: stringed 
instruments like the harp, the lyre, and the kithara 
(a kind of lyre), and wind instruments like the syrinx, 
or pan pipes, made of reeds of different lengths. 
Unfortunately, almost no written music has survived from 
ancient Greece. Perhaps we can guess what it may have 
sounded like by seeing the way women dance on Greek vases. 
They seem to be moving rhythmically to slow and haunting 
tunes. Greek men did not dance, but they liked to watch 
dancers perform at celebrations and at drinking parties 
(pp. 36–37). Poor Greeks, such as farmers and slaves, had 
very little spare time.

35
Battles on board
Herodotos, the 5th-century Greek historian, 
believed that board games were invented in 
Lydia in Asia Minor. Counters, dice, and 
gaming pieces made of stone, bone, and clay 
have been found. Some vases show warriors 
playing board games while they take a rest 
from righting. Here, the two Greek heroes, 
Ajax and Achilles, play a kind of 
backgammon or chess.
Board games similar 
to snakes and 
ladders have been 
known for more 
than 2,000 years
On target
Kottabos was a 
very simple but very 
popular game. It was 
often played at the end of a 
drinking party, but was not 
restricted to men. Players held their 
wine cups by one handle and flicked the dregs 
of wine at a target. The winner was the person who 
hit the target most accurately. In this charming 
scene, a little duck is watching a woman taking aim.
Physically fit
Boys were expected to be in 
good physical shape and 
boxing was just one of 
many sports they were 
encouraged to do. Instead 
of gloves, ancient boxers 
wrapped leather thongs 
(himantes) around their 
hands and wrists which left 
their fingers free.
In a spin
The top had a thread 
attached to it and was 
beaten as it spun around. 
A hard ground surface is 
needed for a really good spin.
Jacks for jills
A favourite game was 
knucklebones. These were 
made from ankle-joints of 
small, cloven-footed 
animals. The game was 
very similar to jacks and a 
classical author described 
it as being “…above all a 
game for women.”

36
Wining and dining
Diver’s tomb
A typical banqueting scene is painted 
on the wall of a tomb at Paestum, a 
Greek colony in southern Italy. It 
shows young men reclining together 
on couches, while slaves serve them 
with food and wine on small tables.
Drinking cup
This is a special kind 
of drinking cup used 
at a symposion. It is in 
the form of a ram’s 
head and the rim is 
painted with a banqueting 
scene of guests leaning 
back on cushioned couches. It 
gives us a clear impression of the 
elegant and comfortable lifestyle 
which wealthy Athenian men 
enjoyed. The cup has no base 
so was probably passed round 
from hand to hand.
In Athens, and other Greek cities, men 
often held banquets or drinking parties (symposia), 
for their male friends. As well as these smaller, 
private symposia, there were also large-scale 
public ones. Private symposia took place at home in 
the dining room (andron) which was set aside for 
the men’s use after the evening meal. Many 
Greek vases show symposia scenes. All respectable women were excluded 
from a symposion, but slave girls called hetairai would entertain the men with 
their dancing, flute playing, and acrobatic displays (pp. 30–31). The evening 
began with the pouring of libations 
(usually wine), and the singing of special 
songs or hymns, to the gods. The guests 
wore garlands and perfume. Early in 
the evening they might discuss 
politics and philosophy, but as they 
drank more and more wine, they 
would tell each other jokes, riddles, 
and stories. Eventually, after drinking a 
great deal of wine, the banqueters 
would fall asleep on their comfortable 
couches, leaving the women and slave 
boys to tidy up.
Olives are plentiful 
in Greece and bowls 
of olives, both green 
and black, would be 
offered at a symposion 
possibly as an 
appetizer
Wine vessels
Wine was the Greeks’ favourite drink. 
It was drunk by everybody, not just 
the rich, and was nearly always 
diluted with water. Bread dipped in 
wine, eaten with a few figs, was a 
typical Greek breakfast. Many different 
kinds of wine container have survived. 
These are often made of clay, but 
sometimes of bronze. The big, bronze 
vessel on the far left was used for mixing 
water and wine together. The mixture 
would then have been transferred to the 
jug with the ladle and the slave would fill 
his master’s cup.

37
Even people wholived 
in towns kept a family 
goat which provided 
milk and cheese.
Fare Fit for the gods
The Greeks grew wheat and barley to 
make bread and porridge, which were 
an important part of their diet. Lentils, 
peas, onions, garlic, and cabbage were 
also eaten in large quantities. Meat 
was eaten mainly on sacrificial 
occasions such as religious festivals, 
when the sacrificial animal would be 
shared out amongst the worshippers. 
For the rest of the time, fish and cheese 
were the main source of protein. Fruit 
such as pomegranates, figs, apples, and 
pears was available, but not oranges and 
lemons which were only cultivated in 
Greece at a much later date.

Fish dish
A variety of fish might 
be served at a 
symposion. Many 
Greek towns were 
near the sea and 
fishermen went out in 
boats to catch mullet, 
tuna, mackerel, and 
sturgeon. This 
mackerel is on a bed 
of bay leaves. The  
Greeks liked to 
flavour their food 
with fresh herbs.
Squid
Fruits of the sea
Octopus and squid are 
abundant in the seas 
around Greece and fish was 
a staple part of everyone’s diet. 
Seafood still plays a large part in 
Greek cuisine today.

a modern platter
Sweeteners
The combination of summer 
drought, winter rains, and long 
spells of winter sunshine, is 
ideal for long-germinating 
plants such as the fig. In the 
absence of sugar, sweet fruits 
like figs were very popular as 
a dessert. Honey was 
used in cakes and 
biscuits.

38
A day out
Greek theatres are among the most spectacular 
buildings that survive from ancient times. In cities like 
Athens, or at sacred sites like Delphi and Epidauros, 
people flocked to see dramas in honour of the gods. In 
Athens, performances for the wine god Dionysos 
developed into what are now known as plays. From the 
middle of the sixth century b.c., plays, organized as 
dramatic competitions, were put on during the spring 
festival of Dionysos. By the fifth century b.c., both 
tragedies and comedies were 
performed and many have survived to 
the present time. Audiences in 
Athens spent days watching the 
plays, seated in the theatre of 
Dionysos on the slope of the Acropolis. The actors 
were all men, even taking the female parts, and no 
more than three main actors could speak to each 
other at one time. A larger group of actors, 
the chorus, commented on the play’s action 
and addressed the audience more directly. 
Music accompanied the plays, which were 
acted out on a flat circular area called the 
orchestra. Women were probably not 
allowed to go to the theatre at all.
Epidauros
This ground-level view of the 14,000 seat theatre at Epidauros, gives 
an idea of what it is like to be an actor going into the performing 
area. The carefully curved auditorium (theatron or viewing theatre) 
is a huge semi-circular bowl cut into the surface of the hillside. Its 
shape is not just designed for excellent viewing; sound, too, is 
caught and amplified, and actors speaking in the orchestra can be 
heard in the back row.
Tired out
This small terracotta 
figure shows a comic 
actor dressed as an old 
woman. He wears a 
mask with a wrinkled 
face and crinkly hair 
which he has pushed 
back on his head, as he 
rests wearily on a seat.
Bird’s eye view
From high up in the back row at 
Epidauros you can get a clear 
view of the performance. Here, a 
temporary set has been built for 
the modern production of 
a play.
Euripides
The expression on this 
sculpture reflects the 
serious subjects dealt 
with by the Athenian 
playwrighty Euripides. 
Some of his plays dealt 
with the horrors of 
war, and upset the 
Athenians because 
they hinted at Athens’ 
savage treatment of 
her enemies.

39
The muse holds a mask 
portraying a young 
woman, one of the 
characters in Greek 
comedy from the fourth 
century b.c.
Souvenir statuettes
Statuettes in terracotta, 
originally painted in bright 
colours, are perhaps souvenirs 
of theatre visits. Also, sets of the 
entire casts of plays have been 
found in graves. The graceful 
female figure is probably a 
muse, one of the nine guardians 
of the arts in Greek mythology. 
The terracotta of the bearded 
actor represents a sinister figure 
from later Greek comedy, who 
lived off the earnings 
of hetairai.
Sophokles
Portraits of famous playwrights were 
produced some time after their death, so 
they were not true likenesses. But 
these sculptures honoured the 
memory of great writers like 
the playwright Sophokles. 
This print decorates a 
19th‑century text of the 
plays. Sophokles’ plays 
about royal or legendary 
families and their tragic 
lives, like those of King 
Oedipus or Electra 
daughter of 
Agamemnon, still grip 
audiences today.
The very elaborate hat is 
a sign that this bearded 
man’s wealth was not 
acquired honestly
Greek drama alive and well
A group of actors from Britain’s 
Royal National Theatre perform 
three plays called The Oresteia, by 
the Athenian playwright 
Aeschylus. They tell of the death 
of Agamemnon after the Trojan 
war and how his son Orestes 
avenged him.

40
The aegina treasure
This gold earring is one 
of a pair that was found, 
with a pendant, on the 
island of Aegina. It was 
made in Minoan times 
(pp. 8–9). The circular 
shape is a snake, and 
inside it are two dogs 
standing on the heads 
of monkeys.
Body beautiful
Beauty and cleanliness were 
important to the ancient Greeks. In 
sculpture and on vases, both men and 
women can be seen wearing elegant, 
softly-folded garments and standing in 
graceful poses (pp. 42–43). Young men 
took great care of their bodies, keeping 
them fit and strong so that they could be 
good soldiers and athletes. Nudity was 
considered quite normal for young men 
who always competed naked at their 
Games (pp. 44–45). After exercise, men 
and boys rubbed themselves with olive 
oil to keep their skins supple. Women 
had their whole bodies clothed, 
including their heads when they went out. Their clothes 
were so finely spun, however, that they were sometimes 
almost transparent, and must have been light and cool to 
wear in the hot summer. Women wore perfumed oils 
and tried to keep out of the sun as much as possible, 
because a sun tan was not considered beautiful. Wealthy 
women owned jewellery, much of it in gold and silver 
and very ornate.
Decoration in death
Jewellery was an indication 
of wealth and prosperity. 
On this grave relief, a slave 
is shown handing a 
bracelet to a woman, 
probably the dead 
person herself.
Follower of fashion
This terracotta figurine shows a 
fashionable Greek woman (pp. 42–43) 
wearing a tunic (chiton) and cloak 
(himation). She is holding a kind of fan. 
Clothes were often brightly coloured 
as can be seen from the traces of paint 
which remain on the statuette. 
Hairstyles were very elaborate and 
this woman is wearing some kind of 
head decoration. Many figures like 
this have been found at Tanagra in 
central Greece.
Bath time
Greeks bathed very regularly. 
This terracotta shows that baths 
were smaller than most modern 
ones. At the feet end of this 
bath, there was a hollow where 
the water was deeper so that 
the woman could splash it 
backwards over her body.
Powder pot
Women used a 
special round, flat 
pot called a pyxis, to 
hold their perfumes 
and cosmetics. These 
pots were sometimes 
decorated with scenes of 
women spinning and weaving.

41
Silver fibulae
Silver medallion
This silver medallion may once have been part of the 
decoration on a bowl. It shows a girl offering a gift to 
Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty. Aphrodite sits on a 
rock decorated with flowers and is turning to look at 
Eros, who is playfully putting an upturned basket on his 
head. Around the medallion are a pair of silver 
brooches (fibulae) linked together by a long plaited 
silver chain. This might have been used for fastening 
a cloak.
Head dress
Beautiful gold wreaths and 
sprays sometimes decorated 
the heads of statues of gods 
and goddesses that were 
carried in procession at 
festivals. Occasionally, 
wreaths were placed on 
the heads of corpses in 
tombs.
Elegant ears
Most earrings were made of gold 
or silver and were made for 
pierced ears. These are in the 
shape of little boats with 
cockleshells hanging from them. 
Inside the boats are tiny sirens, 
half-bird, half-female creatures.
The Westmacott 
athlete
Ideal athlete
This statue is a Roman copy of 
a Greek bronze by the famous 
Greek sculptor, Polykleitos. He 
liked to make statues of naked 
male athletes because he was 
interested in the ideal proportions 
and measurements of the male 
body. At the site of Olympia there 
is a statue base to which the 
original Greek figure may have 
belonged, because the holes in the 
base for the feet are exactly the 
right shape and size. The base is 
inscribed with the name of a 
young boxer called Kyniskos.
Perfume pot
This brightly 
coloured glass 
bottle was 
probably used for 
perfume. Most 
perfume pots were 
made of clay and 
hundreds of them 
have been found. 
Scent made in Corinth 
and Rhodes was exported 
in the bottles to other 
countries.
Well-oiled
On this vase painting, an 
athlete rubs his friend’s 
back with olive oil. 
Afterwards he removes 
the surplus oil with a 
curved bronze body 
scraper.

42
Clothes for comfort
Greek clothes were made largely of wool provided 
by local sheep. The wool was spun very finely so that 
garments were thinner than modern woollen clothing. 
Lighter linen clothes made out of spun flax were also 
worn. Very wealthy people bought expensive silks from 
the East, and in Hellenistic times, mulberry trees were 
planted on the island of Kos to provide a home-grown 
silk industry. Bright colours were popular especially 
among women. Purple was obtained from sea snails 
and a violet shade from a scaly insect larva called 
the kermes worm. Other dyes came from plants. 
Poorer people probably wore undyed clothes. 
The shapes of clothes were much the same 
for both men and women and hardly changed over 
hundreds of years. The basic dress was a straight tunic 
fastened at the shoulder with 
brooches or pins and with a 
cloak flung over the top.
Lady hamilton
Sir William Hamilton, 
British Ambassador to 
Naples in the late 18th 
century, was a collector 
of Greek antiquities. His 
wife Emma, famous for 
her liaison with Lord 
Nelson, often dressed in 
Greek costume.
Hair dressing
Greek women (except slave women) 
wore their hair long. This woman’s style 
was fashionable in the Classical period. 
The hair is piled up at the back of the 
head and held in place with a net and 
ribbons. Diadems, and other gold 
hair decorations, were worn on 
special occasions.
Wrap up
Greek 
underwear was 
not fitted, but, like 
outer clothes, was 
wrapped around the 
body. On this vase a 
woman wearing a strip 
of material as a bra is 
putting her chiton over her head.
Ready to wear
The chiton was said to have 
been invented in the East 
Greek region of Ionia. It was 
made from a single rectangle 
of cloth, cut into two and 
fastened at intervals from 
neck to elbows to give a 
graceful loose sleeve effect. It 
was gathered at the waist with a 
belt. The chiton shown here is 
made out of modern woollen 
fabric. This is perhaps slightly 
thicker and fuller than the 
original material would have 
been in the fifth century b.c. 
Another earlier kind of chiton, 
sometimes called a peplos, 
originated in mainland Greece. 
It was secured with big pins 
on the shoulders and did not 
have sleeves.
Greek fantasy
Sir Lawrence Alma- 
Tadema (pp. 30–31) 
often chose classical 
subjects for his 
paintings. The 
architecture and 
clothing, however, 
frequently owed more 
to his imagination than 
to historical accuracy.

Menswear
This man is wearing a tunic, the 
chiton, and a cloak, the himation. His 
chiton has been pulled up over his 
belt. Workmen nearly always wore a 
very short chiton to give them greater 
freedom of movement. Over the top 
this man is wearing a rectangular 
himation. Younger men sometimes 
wore only the himation which was 
draped over one shoulder and 
wrapped around the hips. Greek 
clothes would not have hems as 
they would have been woven to 
the correct length.

chiton
Family group
Children wore similar clothes to their parents, but 
probably had quite short tunics so that they could 
run about easily. Adults and children went barefoot 
indoors and put on leather sandals with many straps 
when they went out.
Sun protection
Outside, both men and 
women wore hats to protect 
themselves from the hot sun. 
Women thought a suntan was 
unattractive, and if they did 
not have a hat they would 
pull their cloaks up over 
their heads to shield their 
faces, or would wear a 
veil called a kredemnon. 
A wide-brimmed 
travelling hat, like the 
one worn here by this 
fashionable young 
man, was called a 
petasos. It was made 
of wool, but hats made 
of fox fur and straw were 
also common. This 
youth is wearing a short 
travelling cloak called a 
chlamys, fastened on the 
shoulder with a pin 
or brooch.

The Greek games
The Greeks believed in the value of sport as training for 
warfare, and as a way of honouring the gods. There were many 
local sporting competitions, but four big athletic festivals 
attracted men from all over the Greek world. Of these, the most 
important was the Olympic Games, held every four years in 
honour of Zeus at Olympia. Success in the 
Games brought honour to the athlete’s family 
and to his home town. Some successful 
athletes acquired almost mythical status. Wars 
were suspended to allow people to travel in 
safety to and from Olympia. Many beautiful 
temples and other buildings which provided  
facilities for athletes and spectators have been 
excavated there. The Games went on into 
Roman times, coming to an end late in the 
fourth century. In Athens, there were also 
four-yearly games (Panathenaic Games) held 
in honour of Athena as part of her religious 
festival, and they were an important public 
holiday. Discipline in sport was strict, and 
breaking the rules was 
punished 
severely.
Champions
This fourth-century b.c. bronze 
statue of a boy jockey and his 
victorious horse, show the 
difficulties of racing in ancient 
Greece. Riding bare-back and 
without stirrups, jockeys were 
usually paid servants of the 
owners of the horse.
Training time
Wrestling, although popular, was regarded as one of the most 
dangerous of Greek sports. Tripping your opponent up was 
permitted but biting or gouging out his eyes was strictly 
forbidden. The man on the left of this statue base is in a racing 
start position, and the man on the right is testing his javelin.
Prize pots
This boxing scene (336 b.c.) 
was painted on a special kind 
of olive oil pot given as a 
prize to victorious athletes at 
the festival of Athena in 
Athens. Known as Panathenaic 
vases, they always had a 
painting of Athena on one side 
and a painting of the event on 
the other. Here, two boxers 
with rippling muscles are 
fighting each other wearing, 
instead of boxing gloves, 
leather thongs wrapped 
around their fists.
The delphi stadium
The stadium at Delphi is in the highest part of the 
ancient city. The stone starting grooves on the track 
survive, as well as many of the seats, especially where 
they were cut into the mountain side. The stadium 
could hold 7,000 spectators.
The olympic spirit
The spirit of the Olympic Games has greatly 
inspired artists. This 19th-century German 
duotone depicts naked athletes exercising 
against a background of classical columns.

45
Modern games
The Olympic tradition continues today, 
held every four years and divided 
between winter and summer Games. 
Cities all over the world compete 
intensely to host the Games, building 
new Olympic stadia and facilities to 
accommodate the influx of competitors, 
media, tourism, trade, and foreign 
currency that goes with setting up the 
ultimate global sporting event.
The first modern olympics
The first modern Olympics were held in 
1896 in Athens. They were organized by 
Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a Frenchman, 
who was inspired by the ideals of the 
ancient Olympic Games.
Longer jumps
Athletes taking part 
in the long jump, used 
stone or lead jumping 
weights. This Roman 
example had grooves so 
that it could be gripped 
firmly. Holding the weights, 
athletes probably threw 
their arms backwards to give 
themselves extra propulsion 
on take-off.
Torchlight

carrying the Olympic 
flame at the Seoul 
Olympics of 1988. In the 
Athenian games, relay 
races with torches took place 
after dark, the winning team 
lighting a fire on altars to Zeus 
or Athena.
The discus thrower
This famous marble statue of a 
discus thrower is a copy of a Greek 
bronze original, perhaps made by 
the renowned sculptor, Myron.
Dedicated discus
This bronze discus was 
made in the sixth 
century b.c. The inscription 
on it says that it was thrown 
by an athlete called Exoidas 
who won a contest with it, then 
dedicated the discus to Castor and 
Pollux, the twin sons of Zeus. Pollux was a 
champion discus thrower.
The pentathlon
This scene shows athletes taking part in 
the pentathlon, an event which included 
discus and javelin throwing, jumping, 
wrestling, and running. The man at the 
back holds a pair of jumping weights like 
the ones shown below.

46
Wisdom and beauty
For the Greeks, philosophy, or the “love of wisdom”, was 
something which involved not just the way people lived, but a 
great deal of science as well. Early thinkers were concerned with 
ideas about the physical world. Heraclitus developed a theory 
involving atoms, and Pythagoras came up with his theorem, as 
part of his view that the world was based on mathematical 
patterns. He and his fellow thinkers, both men and women, 
also believed that souls could be reborn in other bodies 
(reincarnation), and some even thought that beans might 
contain the souls of old friends and therefore shouldn’t be eaten. Philosophy 
and the arts were part of religion too. Religious hymns celebrated the 
meaning and mystery of life and explained the origin of the gods. The 
Greeks made handsome objects 
both as offerings to the gods and 
also for their own sakes. Music, 
sculpture, painting, pottery, 
and dance all thrived in 
ancient Greece.
Royal pupil
Greek philosophers were 
at the centre of Greek life. 
Here, the philosopher 
Aristotle is tutoring the 
young prince, Alexander 
of Macedon (pp. 62–63).
Piped music
This pipe from 
Athens made out 
of sycamore 
wood, is one of a 
pair; Greeks played 
sets of double pipes. 
There was originally 
a reed in the 
mouthpiece, so the 
pipes would have 
sounded a bit like a 
modern oboe.
Animal 
amplifier
The European 
tortoise was once 
plentiful in Greece, and 
its empty shell made an 
excellent sound-box for 
the stringed instrument 
called the lyre. Its strings, 
which were plucked with a 
plectrum, could be 
tightened to produce a 
range of notes.
Vase painter
Vase painting is considered to be 
one of the minor arts, but the 
work of the potter and painter 
Exekias was of a very high 
standard. This exquisitely 
painted drinking cup shows 
the god Dionysos reclining 
in a boat, with his special 
plant, the vine, twining 
around the mast. The 
god, like the vine, was 
believed to have come 
from the east. The 
dolphins may be the 
pirates who tried to 
capture him, now 
turned into sea 
creatures.
The key to the cosmos
Pythagoras (c.580–500 b.c.) originally from the 
island of Samos, was the leading light of a group 
of religious thinkers in southern Italy. They 
believed that the key to the world (cosmos) lay in 
numbers and mathematical relationships.

47
Plato and pupils
The leading philosophers attracted 
groups of pupils, and much teaching 
was done in discussion groups. Plato 
set up a school for philosophers in 
Athens, his native city, in a pleasant 
garden called the Academy. Plato wrote 
up many ideas of Socrates in the form 
of “dialogues” or discussions between 
pupils and teachers.
Word of mouth
Although Socrates 
(469– 399 b.c.) is one of 
the most famous of the 
ancient Greek 
philosophers, he 
produced no 
philosophical writings. 
He explored philosophy 
by intensive discussions, 
often pretending to be 
ignorant of a subject, in 
order to allow his 
opponents unintentionally 
to demolish their own case. 
Socrates has a bare chest in 
this marble statuette; 
philosophers were often 
shown dressed in this way.
Founding fathers
Side by side, with proud 
gestures, philosophers 
Aristotle (384–322 b.c.) 
and Plato 
(427–347 b.c.) are 
outlined against the sky, 
each holding one of 
their major books in 
their hands. The 
Italian artist 
Raphael 
(1483–1520), 
has placed 
them in the 
very centre of 
his fresco, 
painted on 
the wall of a 
great room in 
the Vatican 
in the early 
16th century.
Death by hemlock
Socrates’ teachings were so 
astonishing, even for the 
fairly broad-minded 
Athenians, that some people 
became suspicious of him. 
He was accused of 
corrupting the minds of the 
young, and of showing 
disrespect for the gods. He 
was imprisoned, then made 
to take his own life by 
drinking a poison, hemlock.
Cup has no flat base 
and was probably 
handed around from 
hand to hand
Seeing eye to eye
The eye was an important 
symbol in ancient Greece. It 
gave life and power to objects. 
Statues had their eyes painted 
in; eyes on the front of warships 
magically guided them. This eye cup 
of the sixth century b.c. blends the 
elements of a face with the patterns found 
on many wine-cups. The eyebrows are 
echoed by long strands of ivy, a plant associated 
with Dionysos. There are a pair of his satyr friends 
escaping around the sides of the cup. The eyes 
themselves have perfectly formed circles incised with 
the sharp point of a pair of dividers.

48
Vases and vessels
The best Greek pottery was made in Athens. A high-
quality clay was found there which fired well to a 
beautiful reddish-brown colour. Athenian potters 
worked in a potters’ quarter called the Kerameikos. 
They produced huge quantities of wheel-made 
pottery for use at home and for the export market. 
There are various styles of decoration in vase 
painting. Between 1000 and 700 b.c. geometric 
patterns were the fashion. Gradually, around 720 b.c., 
oriental motifs came into fashion. The black-figure technique – black silhouette 
figures painted in a highly-refined clay solution on the reddish clay background – 
was the main way of decorating pots from the early to mid sixth century b.c. Inner 
details were incised with a bone or metal tool. Soon after 500 b.c., the red-figure 
technique took over. The figures of gods and 
animals were now left in the reddish-
brown clay and instead the background 
was painted in with a clay solution 
which, in the firing process, turned 
black. Many vases have been 
preserved in excellent condition.
Black-figure 
vase
Drinking up time
Special drinking cups in the form of animal 
heads were very popular. This angry-looking 
griffin rhyton is a good example. The wine 
would have spilt if the rhyton was put down, 
so perhaps it was passed from person to 
person until all the wine was gone.
Trefoil top
What a boar!
Stories of the 12 
labours of Herakles 
often appeared on vases 
(pp. 22–23). On this 
black-figure vase, 
Herakles holds the 
Erymanthian boar 
above King 
Eurystheus who 
cowers in a jar.
First sip
This miniature wine 
jug is called a chous. 
It shows two 
schoolboys, one 
reading from a 
papyrus scroll 
and the other 
holding a lyre. 
The jug would 
have been filled 
with wine and given 
to a little boy as a 
special present at the festival 
of Dionysus, god of wine.
Collector’s item
This early 
19th‑century cartoon 
shows Sir William 
Hamilton (pp. 42–43), 
caricatured as a water 
pot (hydria). Sir 
William was a great 
expert on and 
collector of Greek art, 
especially vases.
The purplish-red 
colour is a mixture of 
the black clay solution 
and a red iron oxide

In this engraving, Sir William is supervising 
the opening of a tomb in Italy. The skeleton 
is surrounded by vases which were exported 
from Athens.

Vase shapes
Vases were made in different 
shapes according to their 
different uses.
Storage containers 
for oil or wine
Pots in which to mix 
wine and water
Jugs for pouring wine
Drinking cups
Perfume, oil, and 
cosmetic containers
pyxis
lekythos
A lion killing a stag
Scent from corinth
This perfume pot (aryballos) 
was made in Corinth, a town 
which produced novelty 
perfume pots in curious shapes 
and exported them all over the 
Mediterranean. The pot would have 
had a wax stopper to prevent the 
evaporation of the perfume.
Look! two hands!
This drinking cup (kylix) was 
held by both handles when in use. It 
was painted in the fifth century b.c. in 
the red-figure technique. The 
exterior decoration could be 
admired when the cup was hung 
up on the wall by one handle.
No change

The ancient techniques 
are still in use today. 
Good copies of ancient 
vases can be bought.

This vase incorporates 
a clay figure of a

being a beautiful 
table decoration, it 
also served a useful 
function. Wine was 
poured in at the top, 
and drained down 
through a hole in the 
bottom into another 
smaller cup. By this 
method, air was 
introduced into 
the wine, which 
made it taste 
nicer.

Farming, fishing, and food
Time stands still
This shepherd and flock 
going home for the 
night look the same as 
they would have done 
in ancient times.
Life on a Greek farm was difficult as 
the soil in much of Greece is of poor 
quality. Greek farmers ploughed in 
spring and then again in autumn. 
Ploughs, which were pulled by oxen, 
were made of wood and sometimes 
tipped with iron to make them 
sharper. The farmworker followed the 
plough, scattering seed, such as barley, 
by hand. Farmers prayed to Zeus, and 
Demeter, goddess of the grain, for a wonderful harvest. On the slopes of the 
hills there were vineyards and some picked grapes drying in the sun. Other 
grapes were gathered to make wine, the most popular Greek drink. Most towns 
and villages were near the sea, and a variety of fish were caught using bronze fish 
hooks. Wealthy people hunted wild deer, boar, and hare. Poorer people ate meat 
only on special festival occasions when animals were sacrificed to the gods and 
then shared out among the worshippers.
Dinner service
Wealthy people always took their food and drink while 
reclining on a couch. Slaves would bring in food and place it on 
a small table in front of the diner. This bronze banqueter is said 
to have come from Dodona in north western Greece.
Hunting and fishing
This fresco of a Bronze Age 
fisherman comes from 
Santorini, a volcanic island 
near Crete. Perhaps he was 
bringing the fish as an 
offering to the palace there. 
The hunter (a vase painting) 
is carrying a fox and a hare, 
while his hunting dog runs 
beside him. He would not 
have eaten the fox, but might 
have made a warm hat from 
the fur.

dog and prey is

his catch appears on a 
Cretan fresco
Beasts of burden
Donkeys were used to take produce to 
market and for transport. Their hardiness 
was ideal for a rough terrain. These two 
little clay donkeys were toys.
Fish dish
This dish is painted with fish and other 
sea creatures and was probably used 
for the fish course at a dinner party. 
The hollow in the centre was 
filled with a thick sauce into 
which the diner would 
dip his fish before 
eating it.

 Duck’s head decorates 
the end of the strainer
Fine wine
Wine was the most 
popular Greek drink 
enjoyed at all times of 
the day. It was quite 
thick, needed straining, 
and was nearly always 
diluted with water. This 
wine strainer is made of 
bronze. Many different 
kinds of utensil and 
container were used for 
the storing, serving, 
and drinking 
of wine.
Attic oil
Attica, the region around 
Athens, was famous for its 
olive groves. Olive oil 
was used in cooking, 
washing, and 
lighting.
Olive harvest
Olive trees grow 
abundantly in Greece. 
On this vase, four 
people are gathering 
olives. One is sitting 
up in the tree, two are 
shaking the branches 
with sticks, and, on the 
ground below, 
another is 
gathering the 
fallen olives in a 
basket.
Swimming in oil
This little dolphin skimming over the 
waves is an oil container, used in 
food preparation. Dolphins 
were common around the 
coasts of Greece.
Dregs collected in the 
bottom of the strainer
Fossilized 
snail on egg
Egg cup
Five hen’s 
eggs in a 
terracotta cup 
were found in a 
tomb on the 
island of Rhodes. 
They are over 2,000 
years old. Many 
households kept hens, and 
eggs were an important part of 
the daily diet. Funeral offerings 
of eggs, both real like these or stone or clay 
imitations, were common in Greek graves. They 
seem to have been symbols of life after death.
Goat for all seasons
Goats were very useful animals. They 
required only rough grazing and their 
skins provided warm clothing for country 
people in winter, as well as milk and 
cheese. This little bronze goat 
was made about 
500 b.c.

52
Crafts, travel, and trade
Fishy business
Fishing provides a livelihood for 
many Greeks today just as it did in 
ancient times. A modern fisherman 
on the island of Mykonos is 
mending his nets.
Stone carvers, metal workers, jewellers, shoemakers, and 
many other craftsmen flourished in the cities of Greece. Their 
workshops were usually in the centre of town around the agora, or 
market place. People would come to buy their products, and 
farmers from the countryside would sell their vegetables, fruit, 
and cheese. There were also weights-and-measures 
officials, money-changers, acrobats, dancers, and slaves 
standing on platforms waiting for a buyer. Most ordinary 
people did not travel far from home (except to 
war). There were few good roads and the 
faithful donkey was the most reliable form of 
transport for shorter journeys. If a Greek 
wanted to travel a long distance he would 
usually go by boat around the coast, 
thereby avoiding the mountains 
which cover much of the country. 
There was a great deal of trade 
between the city-states and 
the Greek colonies, as well 
as with other Mediterranean 
countries. Oil, wine, pottery, 
and metal work were the 
main exports.
Temple treasure
This clay jug with coins 
was found in the 
foundations of the temple 
of Artemis at Ephesus. The 
coins, made of electrum, 
probably date from  
650–625 b.c. This was 
soon after coinage was 
introduced into Greece 
from Lydia in Asia Minor 
(roughly, modern Turkey) 
where coins were invented.

infant Herakles

of Aegina
Three coins
Each city-state, as a symbol of 
independence, issued its own coins 
which were at first made of 
electrum (an alloy of gold and 
silver), and later solely of silver, 
or occasionally gold. They were 
often of great beauty, decorated 
with the symbols of Greek 
deities and many modern coins 
have been modelled on them.
Into africa
This pot in the form of the head of 
an African is evidence of the 
widespread trading contacts of the 
Greeks. Like most ancient sailors, 
they preferred to keep the coast 
within sight where possible.
Beasts of burden
Donkeys could negotiate 
narrow mountain tracks and 
could carry heavy burdens. 
They still do today.

53
Cobbler
This cobbler is depicted at 
the bottom of a red-figure 
cup. He is bending over 
strips of leather which 
he is cutting and 
shaping. Boots, 
sandals, and tools 
hang from the wall 
above him. This 
scene would have 
become visible to the 
drinker when he had 
drained his cup.
At the loom
Upright looms, just like 
this one in use today, were 
used by women in classical 
times to make woollen 
clothing, drapes, and 
furnishing fabrics. Weaving 
was regarded as a noble, as 
well as a necessary task.
Blacksmith
This painting on a jug shows a 
blacksmith at work. His furnace is a 
brick-built shaft fuelled with 
charcoal. Bellows would have been 
used to fan the flames. The metal, 
which was placed inside the shaft, 
trickled down to form a lump at the 
bottom, which the blacksmith can here 
be seen removing with a pair of tongs.
Deep sea fishing
A great variety of 
fish were available 
in the deeper 
waters. Wooden 
vessels, like this 
modern one, were 
used for such 
fishing expeditions. 
Eels and salted fish 
were favourite 
Greek delicacies.
Potter
The Greeks are famous for 
their beautiful pottery. 
Every town had its 
potters’ quarter 
(pp. 48–49) where 
pots were made and 
sold. On this wine 
cup, a potter sits at 
his wheel, the 
speed of which he 
controls with his 
knee. Above him on 
a shelf are some of 
his pots, and below 
him (now slightly 
damaged) sits a pet dog 
who is watching his master 
at work.

Warfare
Body armour
Helmet with 
nose protection
Shielded
This Greek vase 
painting shows 
how the soldier 
wears his shield, 
passing his arm 
under an iron bar 
and gripping a 
leather strap at 
the rim.
Warfare was a normal 
part of Greek life, and the 
city-states frequently fought 
each other. Many Greek men, 
therefore, had to join an army, and 
from the earliest times had to pay 
for their own armour and equipment. 
In Athens, boys trained as soldiers 
between the ages of 18 and 20 after 
which they could be called up for 
military service. In Sparta, it was much 
earlier (pp. 56–57). Athenian soldiers 
were led by ten commanders called strategoi. The 
infantry soldiers were the backbone of the Greek 
armies and they fought in close formations called 
phalanxes. Poorer soldiers served in auxiliary units as 
archers and stone-slingers. When laying siege to cities, 
the armies of Hellenistic Greece used catapults, flame-
throwers, battering-rams, and cauldrons containing 
burning coals and sulphur. Athens controlled its empire 
by  means of oar-powered 
warships or triremes. At 
the height of its power, 
Athens could rely on 
about 300 triremes.
Battle of salamis
The famous sea battle of Salamis was a turning 
point in the Persian Wars (pp. 18–19). It took 
place just off the coast of Athens in 480 b.c. and 
was a triumphant victory for the Greeks over the 
Persian fleet. As a result of this battle, the Persian 
king Xerxes and much of his army went back to 
Asia, abandoning the invasion of Greece.
Hoplite
Greek soldiers were 
called hoplites from 
the word hoplon 
meaning shield. Only 
men from wealthy 
families could be 
hoplites, because only 
they could afford 
expensive armour 
and weapons.
Speedy beasts
Greek chariots were 
often decorated with 
animals associated with 
speed. These bronze 
horses were once fixed 
on to a fast chariot.
Naked bravery
In this painted scene 
from a vase, a warrior 
is holding a metal 
cuirass, (body armour). 
He also has a long 
spear and a shield. 
Nakedness is a symbol 
of heroic bravery in 
Greek art.
Greaves

55
Helmets
Helmets protected the 
head from every sort 
of slash and from 
blows and knocks. 
They varied in shape 
and some had crests 
made of horse hair to 
make the wearer 
appear more impressive 
and frightening.

no nose guard

and cheek guards
Greaves
Hoplites wore bronze leg guards 
called greaves (below) to protect 
the lower part of their legs in 
battle. Some of these greaves may 
have originally been fixed on to 
large statues of heroic warriors in 
southern Italy.
Breastplate
The breastplate, or cuirass, was usually, 
although not always, made of bronze. It 
was the main piece of body armour 
protecting all the upper organs. 
Cuirasses were made to measure, 
each man being specially fitted. The 
more expensive cuirasses would 
have ridges, roughly aligned to the 
body muscles, which were meant to 
deflect blows. The cuirass was made of 
two plates joined at the sides by leather 
straps. The side areas, therefore, were 
the most vulnerable parts of the body.
Foot combat
A painted vase shows two 
Greek combatants separated 
by a herald.
Sculpted ridges

Warship
The fastest Greek ship was called a trireme and it needed 170 oarsmen to row it. They sat in 
three levels, one above the other, on either side of the boat. At the prow was a pointed ram 
strengthened with metal, which could sink enemy ships. There was often an eye painted on 
the prow (pp. 46–47). This illustration shows two sails, but warships may have had only one, 
probably made of linen and lowered when the ship was engaged in battle.
Champion fight
This red-figure vase shows a fight between 
two heroes of the Trojan War, Achilles and 
Hektor (pp. 12–13). The vase painter has 
clearly painted the blood flowing from the 
wound just above Hektor’s knee. Both 
heroes are wearing the crested helmets 
and armour worn by infantry soldiers of 
the 5th century b.c.
The long spear 
was the main 
weapon of the 
Greek infantry

56
The state of Sparta
Sparta in southern Greece was founded in the tenth century 
b.c. by the Dorians, who defeated the original inhabitants of the area. 
Two centuries later, Sparta conquered its neighbour, Messenia, and 
gained excellent agricultural land. It became a luxury-loving state 
producing fine crafts. Music and poetry also flourished. Later, the 
Spartans were defeated in war, and the conquered Messenians 
engaged in a long­running rebellion, so Sparta turned to military 
matters. It became a super-power in Greece and the main rival of 
Athens, and Spartan society was dominated by the need to maintain power. All 
men of Spartan birth had to serve in the army. Their whole lives were dedicated 
to learning the arts of war. Boys of seven were taken from their families to live in 
army barracks. Non­citizens in Sparta were either perioikoi or helots. The 
perioikoi were free men who, although they did not have the rights of 
citizens, were allowed to trade, and serve in the army. Helots were the 
descendants of the original 
inhabitants of the area. 
They farmed the land 
and did all the heavy

The Piraeus is the port of Athens,  
6 km (4 miles) to the southwest of the 
city. In this engraving it is being besieged 
by Spartan ships in 388 b.c.
Natural protection
This 19th-century German engraving shows 
the site of Sparta in a fertile plain of Lakonia 
in southern Greece. Its remoteness was an 
advantage to the warring Spartans and the high 
mountains to the east, north, and west, and the 
sea to the south, formed natural defences.
Spartan warrior
The Greek historian 
Herodotus wrote that 
Spartan soldiers, like 
this one of the fifth 
century b.c., always 
combed their long hair 
when they felt they 
might be about to put 
their lives at risk, as 
when going into battle. 
The scarlet colour of 
the military cloaks 
became a symbol of 
Spartan pride.
The young spartans
Spartan scenes were a popular 
subject with artists of the 
19th century. This unusual 
painting by French impressionist 
painter Edgar Degas (1834–1917) 
shows boys and girls exercising in 
the valley of the river Eurotas 
which runs through Sparta. The 
girls look much more aggressive 
than girls from other Greek cities.
Spartan regime
The Spartan system of education, with 
its emphasis on physical fitness, was 
much admired in 19th-century 
Victorian Britain. Corporal 
punishment too was regarded as 
character-forming for schoolboys, 
just as it was in ancient Sparta. 
The violence of this cartoon by 
British cartoonist George 
Cruikshank (1792–1878) suggests 
that he thought otherwise.

In the lead
This girl is taking part in a running 
race and is looking back to see how far 
she is in the lead. She is wearing a very 
short skirt which no girl from any 
other Greek city would dare to wear. 
Girls did not fight in wars but, like 
most boys, they were trained in 
running and for an outdoor life. This 
made them fit and strong so that they 
would have healthy babies who would 
grow up to be good soldiers.

Offerings
Hundreds of thousands of 
small figurines have been 
found at a sanctuary of 
Artemis Orthia on the banks of 
the river Eurotas at Sparta. Among 
animals such as stags, dogs, and 
horses are representations of Artemis 
herself. There are also figurines of the 
goddess Athena wearing a helmet. 
The figurines were made at the 
sanctuary and sold to visitors who 
often left them behind as offerings 
to the goddess. It was to this 
sanctuary that Spartan boys 
were taken to be flogged as 
a demonstration of their 
toughness and endurance.

58
Science and medicine
The Greeks were interested in science and, influenced by Egyptian and 
Babylonian scholars, made advances in biology, mathematics, astronomy, and 
geography. In the third century b.c., the astronomer, Aristarchus, already 
understood that the earth revolved around the sun, and another astronomer, 
Anaxagoras (500–428 b.c.), discovered that the moon reflected sunlight. The 
most advanced scientific work took place in Hellenistic times (pp. 62–63).  
An important area of Greek science was medicine. The Greeks believed that 
illness was a punishment sent by the gods to whom they prayed for a cure. 
Sanctuaries of the god Asclepius (the god of medicine) were found all over the 
Greek world. The most famous one was at Epidaurus. Many sick people came 
there and spent the night in the temple. They believed that Asclepius appeared 
to them in “dreams” to prescribe treatments such as herbal remedies, diets, 
and exercises. The next day, the priests would carry out the 
treatment and many people went away cured. The Greeks 
developed sophisticated medical treatments for all kinds of 
diseases. These treatments, based on practical research, 
grew out of the Asclepiad cult and were practised by 
Hippocrates (460–377 b.c.) who is often described as the 
founder of modern medicine.
Asclepiades
Asclepiades was a famous 
Greek doctor of the first 
century b.c. He was  
very knowledgeable in the 
theory and practice  
of medicine. He also 
believed in wine as an  
aid to recovery and the 
importance of a pleasant 
bedside manner, so he was 
very popular with all  
his patients.
Antikythera 
mechanism
The inner workings of the 
mechanism were originally 
fronted by a brass plate 
with a dial that showed 
the positions of 
astronomical bodies
The different parts of 
the mechanism are all 
very corroded, and some 
are stuck together
The antikythera mechanism
This device was found in the wreck of a ship that sank in 82 b.c. 
off the Greek island of Antikythera. Made of bronze and about 
33 cm (13 in) high, the shoebox-sized device would originally 
have been mounted in a wooden frame. The complexity of the 
clock-like mechanism, which contained more than 30 gears, 
stunned experts. X-ray analysis of the heavily corroded parts 
revealed that the Antikythera mechanism was probably an early 
type of “computer”. When dates were entered via a crank, the 
mechanism indicated the relative positions of the Sun, Moon, 
and planets. It was most likely used for navigation, or perhaps for 
astrological or astronomical calculations.
It all adds up
This engraving from the 
Margarita Philosophica of 1496 
shows the Roman philosopher 
Boethius (a.d. 480–524) doing 
mathematical calculations, and 
the Greek mathematician 
Pythagoras (pp. 46–47) 
working at an abacus. The 
woman in the centre is 
probably a muse of learning.
Temple of asclepius
In this engraving, people can be seen 
approaching a statue of the god Asclepius. 
He is sitting on a throne and holding his 
staff which has a serpent twisted round it. 
A real snake, regarded as sacred and kept 
in all temples to Asclepius, can be seen 
slithering along the plinth.
Temple visit
In this painting by the 
19th-century artist John 
William Waterhouse 
(1849–1917) a child has 
been brought by his 
mother to the temple of 
Asclepius. Priests of the 
god stand around waiting 
to interpret his wishes.

59
Modern models
The practice of leaving a 
model of the affected part of 
the body as a thanks 
offering, still continues in 
churches in some countries 
today. These modern 
examples are from Athens.
Tokens
These modern silver 
tokens are also thanks 
for cures. The animals 
indicate that people 
believed that they too 
could be cured with the 
help of offerings.
Hippocrates
The famous physician, 
Hippocrates, was born on the 
island of Kos. He wrote 53 
scientific books on medical topics, 
now known as the Corpus. He 
taught that the human body was a 
single organism and each part 
could only be understood in the 
context of the whole. Modern 
doctors still take the Hippocratic 
Oath which is the basis of 
medical ethics.
Thanks
Patients who had been 
cured by Asclepius often 
left a model of the part of 
their body affected by 
illness, as an offering of 
thanks to the god for 
curing them. This marble 
relief of a leg has an 
inscription to Asclepius 
carved upon it and was 
dedicated by a 
worshipper called Tyche.

Death and the afterlife
Death came early for most people in 
ancient times, because life was very 
harsh. Young men often died in battle 
and young women in childbirth. The 
Greeks believed in – or hoped for – 
some kind of life after death, although 
their ideas about this state varied. The 
kingdom of the dead was generally 
thought to be deep in the earth, and 
therefore many people buried their 
dead. But sometimes corpses were 
cremated on a funeral pyre. The soul was sometimes shown as a tiny 
winged person, and some Greeks believed that it escaped from the 
body and rose up to become one of the stars, waiting until it could be 
reborn in a new body. Gods, such as Dionysus, who, like the vines he 
protected, died and was reborn each year, gave people hope of new 
life. The goddess of the grain, Demeter, whose daughter Persephone 
was snatched away by Hades, the god of the underworld, claimed 
back her daughter for part of the year (spring and summer) too. 
Tombs were decorated with pictures of feasts and the dead person’s 
favourite things, and food was placed in the grave, so that the dead 
could be happy in the afterlife.
The diver
This delightful painting was found on the inside 
of a stone sarcophagus (coffin) found at 
Poseidonia, a Greek city in southern Italy, later 
called Paestum. It probably represents the leap 
of the dead into the unknown.
King of the underworld
Zeus ruled the earth and sky, 
Poseidon, the sea. The third of 
these divine brothers was Hades, 
king of the underworld, also 
known as Pluto. Eventually the 
underworld came to be known 
simply as Hades.
Flask of farewell
Offerings to the dead included 
narrow flasks known as lekythoi, 
which contained oil used to 
anoint the body. They were 
decorated with delicately 
painted scenes of farewell. This 
dead warrior, perhaps a victim 
of one of the many wars in 
fifth‑century Greece, receives 
his helmet from a woman. The 
goose at their feet, the bird of 
Aphrodite (pp. 20–21) hints at 
their relationship.

61
Mourning line
A Greek funeral was 
a dramatic event. The 
body was laid out on 
a couch, with the feet 
facing the door to 
ensure that the spirit 
would leave. A 
wreath was placed 
on the head. A 
procession of 
mourners wearing 
black robes escorted 
the corpse. The 
women cut off their 
long hair as a sign of 
grief and gave a lock 
of it to the dead 
person. They also 
tore at their cheeks 
until the blood ran.
Tombstone
In Athens at certain periods, tombstones, carved in 
marble and originally painted in bright colours, were 
placed above graves. Above the carving of the dead 
person, the sloping lines of a roof suggested a temple or 
shrine. Here the dead man, Xanthippos, sits on an elegant 
curved chair, his children shown on a smaller scale beside 
him. His name is carved 
above him. It is not really 
known why he was 
holding a foot, but 
possibly he was 
a shoemaker.
Death before dishonour
After the death of Achilles, the great 
warrior Ajax failed to become the 
champion of the Greeks fighting at Troy. 
He could not live with the shame, so 
killed himself by falling on his sword. 
This famous incident from the Trojan 
War is often shown on 
painted pots and is also 
the subject of a great 
play by Sophokles 
(pp. 38–39).
The entrance to hades
Ancient people thought that certain 
places might be the entrance to the 
underworld. Many Greeks had 
settled near Solfatara in southern 
Italy, where the steaming sulphur 
lake made it a prime candidate.
Fare for the ferryman
Charon was the grim ferryman who carried 
people across the black waters of the river 
Styx and into the kingdom of the dead. In 
this painting by John Stanhope  
(pp. 12–13), the underworld is a gloomy 
place with whispering reeds and spindly 
trees through which dead souls can be seen 
making their way to the river. The one way 
trip in Charon’s punt cost one obol. The 
family of the dead sometimes left a coin on 
the corpse for the journey.

62
Alexander and the Hellenistic age
In the fourth century b.c., a strong king called Philip II turned 
Macedonia, in the north, into the most powerful state in Greece. After 
his assassination in 337 b.c., his 20-year-old son Alexander, a military 
genius, took over the reins of power. Not content with ruling Greece, 
he invaded Persian territory in 334 b.c., and then pressed on through 
Asia Minor, then south and east to Egypt, Afghanistan, and India. He 
established new Greek cities, such as Alexandria in Egypt, and thus 
spread Greek culture over a vast area. Alexander, called the Great, 
intended to create a huge empire, incorporating most of the 
then known world. His death of a fever in 323 b.c. ended this 
ambition, and instead, his vast empire was divided up 
among his quarrelling generals. The period from the 
death of Alexander until about 30 b.c. is known as the 
Hellenistic Age from the word “Hellene” meaning 
Greek. The Hellenistic 
kingdoms preserved 
many aspects of 
Greek life but they 
were eventually 
overcome by the 
rising power of 
Rome.
Excavation at ephesus
Ephesus was a teeming city on the 
coast of Asia Minor where Greeks 
and people of many other 
nationalities lived together. The city 
and its famous sanctuary, dedicated 
to the goddess Artemis, thrived in 
the Hellenistic period and 
throughout the Roman period.
One man and his dog
This charming ring from 
the Hellenistic period is 
decorated with a scene of a 
shepherd with his dog and 
his crook.
Ruins at Pergamum
Town planning
Pergamum, a Hellenistic city 
in Asia Minor, was the power 
base of the wealthy Attalid 
dynasty. The ruins of temples 
and other opulent civic 
buildings can still be seen on 
the terraces cut into the steep 
mountain site. The people of 
Pergamum must have 
enjoyed spectacular views 
over the surrounding 
countryside.
Eros tiara
Alexander’s troops captured a great deal of Persian gold, 
and gold jewellery became very fashionable in aristocratic 
circles. Elaborate diadems, closely resembling crowns, 
have been found. Fixed at the front of this spectacular 
one is a tiny figure of Eros, the personification of love, 
holding a jug.
Ruins at 
Pergamum
Aphrodite
Terracotta figurines of 
Aphrodite, goddess of love 
and beauty, were popular in 
Hellenistic times. She is nearly 
always shown without any 
clothes, sometimes tying a ribbon 
in her hair, sometimes bending 
down to fasten her sandal.

Family of darius
In this painting by the Italian artist 
Paolo Veronese (1528–1588), 
Alexander is shown receiving the 
submission of the family of his 
defeated enemy Darius. Notice that 
the artist has dressed everyone in 
16th-century clothes.
The defeat of darius
Alexander finally defeated the Persian 
king Darius III in a long and bloody 
battle at Gaugamela in Mesopotamia 
(south-west Asia) in 331 b.c., and 
Darius fled. After this, Alexander 
called himself “King of Asia”. In this 
etching, he can be seen on horseback, 
fighting fearlessly.

Alexander the Great
Wall of fire
Alexander entered India in 327 b.c. 
and defeated Poros, a local ruler. 
When his troops refused to march 
further east, he turned south down 
the Indus river to the sea. Alexander’s 
fame lived on in legend. This Indian 
painting shows him building a 
defensive wall of fire.
Trunk charger
This coin shows 
Alexander on horseback 
attacking two Indian 
warriors mounted on an 
elephant. It is thought to 
have been issued in 
Babylon in 323 b.c.
Alexander’s empire
Alexander did not just want to 
build an empire, he also 
wanted it to last. To stop 
rebellion and invasion by 
conquered peoples, he 
founded many colonies 
populated by his own former 
soldiers who followed the 
Greek way of life. On the 
whole he treated the 
conquered peoples with 
respect and encouraged his 
men to marry eastern women. 
His conquests came to an end 
in India because his men 
refused to fight any further.

FAscinating Facts
Lion Gate, Mycenae, erected in the 
thirteenth century b.c.
The prehistoric Mycenaeans built such 
huge stone walls around their citadels – 
some of them were 14 m (46 ft) wide – that 
later civilizations believed they were the 
work of giants.
The distinctive proportions and  
one-foot-forward stance typical of 
kouroi (male nude temple statues) were 
adopted from ancient Egyptian figures. 
Monumental in size, they were idealized 
rather than naturalistic in style.
Slaves were very important to the 
economy of ancient Greece. Some  
had very hard lives, but many were 
respectfully treated and well educated. 
Those taken prisoner by the Romans after 
their conquest were highly prized, and 
some worked as teachers and doctors.
Greek theatres, with their tiered 
seating, were very sophisticated  
in terms of sight lines and sound 
amplification. They had to be built into 
natural slopes, though, since the Greeks  
did not have the engineering skills to 
support the necessary height and weight of 
the buildings on flat ground.
Archimedes, legendary mathematician 
and scientist, was murdered by the 
Romans in 212 b.c. during their conquest  
of Greek territories. This conquest was 
complete by 146 b.c.
Pan, Greek god of fields, shepherds 
and woodlands, was believed to 
have a terrifying voice, which 
could paralyse animals with 
fear, stop armies from 
advancing and topple city 
walls. The god’s name is 
the root of our word panic.
The apparently 
upright, tapering 
columns on the Parthenon 
actually lean inwards slightly 
and bulge in the middle. This is to 
compensate for the effects of 
perspective, which visually distorts 
straight lines and accurate alignments. 
For the same reason, the Parthenon 
frieze is sculpted in deeper relief 
towards the top, and the building’s base and 
steps are imperceptibly higher in the middle 
than at the edges.
No mortar was used in the 
construction of Greek temples: stone 
blocks were smoothly fitted together and 
held with metal clamps and dowels.
The ancient Greeks established a 
tradition of making and decorating 
pottery that lasted for over 1,000 years. 
Certainly, some of the objects they produced 
would look very strange to us – cups and 
bottles, for example, that could not be set 
down on a flat surface because they had 
curved or pointed bases. Many others, 
though, such as simple rounded jugs and 
storage pots, are almost exactly the same 
as the ones in a twenty-first century 
kitchen.
Colour was very important to the ancient 
Greeks, especially in the Hellenistic 
period (from 323 to about 30 b. c.). In fact, 
many of the white marble statues we 
associate with this time were once 
brightly painted.
Alexander the 
Great was 
given his horse 
Bucephalus, when 
he was 12 years 
old. No adult could 
control the 
animal, but 
Alexander discovered 
that the horse was 
frightened of his 
own shadow, so 
he calmed him by 
turning his head to 
the sun.
Macedonian soldiers originated 
a battle line called a phalanx, in 
which they would huddle 
close together forming a 
compact mass with 
their shields. This 
powerful unit would 
then push and 
shove its way 
through enemy 
lines.
The Greeks 
invented picture 
mosaics in the fifth century 
B.C. They used the new 
technique to decorate their 
floors with elaborate 
mythological scenes. The 
first mosaics were made from coloured 
pebbles, but these were later replaced 
with specially cut cubes of glass, stone or 
marble called tesserae, which produced 
finer detail and a larger range of colours.

Questions and answers
Q
What happened when the ancient 
Greeks consulted the Oracle of 
Apollo at Delphi?
A
Those who wanted advice from the 
Oracle would be required to sacrifice 
an animal on the altar. The petitioner was 
then led into the presence of the priestess 
and would ask a question. Although she 
was in a trance, the priestess answered 
questions clearly. Some replies were later 
turned into verses, and from these the 
Delphi Oracle gained a reputation for 
giving confusing responses.
Q
Why was Delphi considered a 
sacred place?
A
According to legend, the god Zeus 
released two eagles from opposite 
ends of the Earth. Their paths crossed 
above Delphi, which established it as the 
centre of the world, and a sacred site.  
The spot was originally marked out with 
a navel stone or omphalos, a Hellenistic 
copy of which can be seen in the Delphi 
Museum. The young god Apollo was 
thought to live at Delphi, which is why, 
from the end of the eighth century b.c., 
people came here to ask his advice.

Q
Where did traditional Greek drama 
come from?
A
Greek drama developed in the sixth 
century b.c. from ritual role-playing 
during festivals of Dionysus, the god of 
revelry and wine. At first, the participants 
danced in groups and were often dressed 
as animals. Later, singing and dancing 
choruses were joined by actors wearing 
masks with exaggerated features to 
indicate the characters they 
were playing so they could 
be clearly seen by everyone 
in the audience. The first 
proper plays were tragedies 
in the form of episodes from 
myths and epic poems. They 
were staged in sets of three, 
all written by the same 
person. Comedy did not 
appear on the Greek stage 
until about 480 b.c.

Q
Where did the tradition 
of the marathon run 
come from?
A
In 490 b.c., the Greeks 
were facing invasion by 
Darius of Persia, whose 
warships landed in the Bay of 
Marathon. Despite being 
heavily outnumbered, the 
Greeks surrounded the enemy 
troops and drove them back to 
the sea, losing only 192 men 
during the fighting, while 
6,000 Persians perished. News 
of the victory was taken back 
to Athens – a distance of 
41 km (26 miles) – by a runner 
in full armour, who collapsed 
and died immediately afterwards. The 
modern marathon has its roots in this 
heroic effort.
Q
Why is classical Greek architecture 
so widely admired?
A
State and religious buildings in  
ancient Greece were designed and 
built with the express intention of 
embodying perfect form and proportion. 
The degree of success their architects 
achieved is illustrated by the fact that their 
classical style has survived, has seldom 
fallen out of fashion, and has often 
dominated aesthetic taste. Superb 
examples were built in revolutionary 
France, Georgian England, the newly 
formed United States and nineteenth-
century Athens, where Neoclassical 
architecture completely dominated public 
building (see page 68–69).

Record Breakers
First of the greats
The Greek warrior king Alexander (356-323 b.c.) 
was the first leader to be widely known as 
“the Great”. During his short life, he founded 
70 cities, several of which were named 
Alexandria after him.
Early learning
Aristotle, a pupil of Plato, founded the 
Lyceum in Athens where subjects as diverse 
as biology and ethics could be taught. 
This institution turned Athens into one of 
the first university cities in the world.
First stone theatre
The first stone theatre ever built, and the 
birthplace of Greek tragedy, was the Theatre of 
Dionysus, which was cut into the southern cliff 
face of the Acropolis. The remains of a restored 
and redesigned Roman version can still be seen 
there today.
Early records
Greek historians dated events by the Olympic 
Games. They calculated that the first games  
took place in 776 b.c. Named for the Sanctuary 
of Olympia on the Peloponnese peninsula, 
where they were held, the games originally  
had only one event – men’s sprinting – and  
the runners were all local. Later, other  
competitions, such as wrestling, boxing, 
jumping, javelin throwing, and riding, were 
added, and the games were thrown open to 
people from other parts of Greece.

Who’s who?
No other single culture has influenced western civilization more 
profoundly than that of ancient Greece. Over a period of a 
few hundred years, this warm land between the Mediterranean, 
Aegean and Ionian Seas produced an unequalled collection of 
statement, writers and artists, men of science, and great thinkers 
whose ideas and innovations are still widely valued.

as documented by his pupil, Plato, are 
known as “dialogues”.
plato

founder of the Lyceum, Aristotle had an 
outstanding gift for scientific observation, 
and one of his most valued legacies is a 
treatise on Ethics.

third centuries b.c. He taught that 
genuine human happiness is the highest 
good, and he encouraged its responsible 
pursuit. Author of a 37-book treatise

He also discovered the pain-killing effects of 
willow bark, from which modern scientists 
extracted aspirin.

Third-century b.c. astronomer who understood 
that the Earth revolves around the Sun and 
that it rotates on its own axis.

The parthenon
Completed in the mid-fifth century 
b.c., the Parthenon was designed 
by the architects Kallikrates and 
Iktinos to house a monumental 
12 m (40 ft) statue of Athena 
sculpted by Pheidias. When the 
temple was new, the carvings above 
the outside row of columns 
were painted in blue, 
red and gold.
The influence of ancient greece has spread throughout 
almost every country in the western world, and most major 
museums have a section devoted to Greek art and antiquities. 
Perhaps the culture’s best-known and most powerful symbol, 
however, is the fortified citadel complex of the Acropolis in 
Athens with its sacred centre, the Parthenon.
  Created as a temple to Athena, patron goddess 
of Athens, the Parthenon was completely 
symmetrical. It was constructed of stone 
and locally quarried white marble, an 
ideal medium for the detailed relief 
panels on the frieze and portico. 
During its long history, 
the Parthenon has been a 
church, a mosque and 
even an arsenal, but 
today, its inspiring ruins 
are a popular tourist 
attraction and a place of 
pilgrimage for anyone 
with a fascination for 
the classical world.

Mask is 
made of gold
Mask of 
agamemnon
Discovered at 
Mycenae by 
Heinrich Schliemann 
(see page 67), this 
death mask in the 
National Archaeological 
Museum of Athens dates from 
about 1500 b.c. Experts now know 
that it does not portray the legendary 
king, Agamemnon, who led the Greek 
forces in the Trojan war, but the object’s 
longstanding fame makes it difficult to 
alter the name by which it is best known.
The parthenon frieze
The carved frieze that ran around the inner wall of the 
Parthenon was designed by Pheidias, the artist responsible for 
all the carving and sculpture in the temple. The individual 
segments of the frieze are called metopes; together they portray 
a procession of worshippers taking part in the Panathenaic 
festival, which was held every four years to celebrate Athena’s 
birthday. This section is on display at the British Museum.

National archaeological 
museum, athens
Opened in 1891, this museum 
displays an enormous number of 
Greek works of art that had 
previously been stored all over the 
city. Designed in the Neoclassical 
style that harks back to Greece’s 
golden age, the building’s entrance 
is dominated by Ionic and 
Corinthian columns.
Marathon boy
Found on the sea floor, like many 
other Greek bronzes, this graceful 
nude (in the National Archaeological 
Museum, Athens), is thought to be the 
work of the sculptor Praxiteles, who 
was active in the fourth century b.c.
Greek Theatre
This drawing of the character 
Creon from Sophokles’ play 
Antigone comes from an 1899 
issue of the French magazine 
La Theatre. The study of Greek 
theatrical tradition is one way 
we have been able to learn 
about classical Greek culture.
Painted jar
Two-handled vessels with narrowed 
necks are called amphoras, and they were 
designed to store liquid (oil, wine, or water) 
or foods preserved in liquid. The detailed 
scene of olive-gathering painted on this 
example from the British Museum suggests that 
it was intended for olives or olive oil.
