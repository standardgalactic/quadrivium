Acknowledgments
Writing this book has been quite a journey, and during the evolution of this book, I have 
accumulated many debts, only a few of which I have space to acknowledge here.
I would like to offer a big thanks to Packt Publishing for publishing this book. Special thanks to 
the Project Coordinator, Anurag Banerjee, for his continuous support since the very beginning. 
I must thank Sharvari Tawde and Rukhsana Khambatta who helped me with proofreading and 
styling, and offered valuable comments to make this book better. Thanks to the entire team of 
Packt Publishing for their help and dedication.
I wanted to offer my sincere thanks to Ian Grieve and James Wood for their insightful feedback 
and excellent technical review. They have helped me ill the gaps and improve the overall 
quality of the book.
I have been fortunate enough to work amid a very passionate set of people; they have all 
helped me enrich my knowledge base. I want to offer thanks to them for their help with  
writing this book.
I have spent most of my time writing when my little daughter, Dishita, expected me to spend 
time with her. Finally she will have her papa back with her. Dishita, you surely deserve 
packets of chocolates. My wife, Sangeeta, has been a consistent support, and without 
her help and encouragement, this book would not have become a reality. I want to thank 
my family immensely for their best wishes, which have always provided me strength and 
encouragement.
Last but not least, I beg forgiveness of all those who have been with me through the course of 
writing this book and whose names I have failed to mention.

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
8
Introduction
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server is a .NET-based web application that works exclusively 
with Microsoft SQL Server databases. It uses Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) 
as the communication protocol. Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 supports three types of 
deployment, namely, on-premises deployment, Internet-facing Deployment (IFD), and CRM 
Online. Each deployment supports a choice of client applications, which are as follows:
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Web Client
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Microsoft Ofice Outlook
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Microsoft Ofice Outlook with Ofline Access
 
f
Mobile Express for Microsoft Dynamics CRM
The on-premises and IFD deployment types are deployed using the data center or hardware 
capabilities of the customer or a hosting partner. On the other hand, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
Online is a powerful solution that provides customers with the beneits of Dynamics CRM in a 
Microsoft-hosted environment.
In this chapter, we will dive deep into the recipes for on-premises deployment of Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011, and in Chapter 3, Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011,  
we will discuss how to conigure a CRM deployment for IFD.
Single server versus multiserver
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 can be installed on a single server as well as on multiple 
servers. While a single-server deployment is mainly recommended for development purposes 
or small-user-based production deployments, a multiserver deployment is more suitable for 
most production environments because multiserver environments provide a better balancing 
of processing load across several servers. Load-balanced multiserver deployment can 
increase the performance, availability, scalability, and throughput of the system. In addition,  
it also can increase the resilience of the system to server failures.
To begin with, we shall start with a recipe on the installation of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 
on a single-server box with all its required components. Upon successful installation on a 
single box, we will ind the recipe on the installation of a multiserver machine more useful.
One limitation of single-server deployments is that the server machine on which Dynamics 
CRM 2011 is installed cannot function as an Active Directory directory service domain 
controller unless the operating system of the server is Windows Small Business Server.

Hardware and software speciications for Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
Like any other software, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 also comes with minimum 
recommended hardware and software speciications. Based on the Microsoft guidelines,  
the recommended hardware speciications for a Full Server deployment is as follows:
 
f
Quad-core x64 architecture
 
f
2 GHz CPU or higher, such as Intel Xeon or AMD Opteron systems
 
f
8 GB of RAM or more
 
f
40 GB or more of hard disk space
Hardware sizing greatly depends on nonfunctional requirements such as total user base, 
maximum number of concurrent users, required page load time, initial data volume, data 
growth, and data archival policy. Microsoft Dynamics Lab has released Performance Toolkit 
for Dynamics CRM 2011, which can be used to collect performance-related data that then 
can be used for sizing the related decisions in on-premises deployment. Performance Toolkit 
can be downloaded at http://pinpoint.microsoft.com/en-gb/applications/
performance-toolkit-for-microsoft-dynamics-crm-2011-12884915630.
The Microsoft-recommended hardware speciications for the SQL Server-based Dynamics 
CRM database are as follows:
 
f
Quad-core x64 architecture
 
f
2 GHz CPU or higher, such as AMD Opteron or Intel Xeon systems
 
f
16 GB of RAM or more
 
f
SAS RAID 5 or RAID 10 hard disk array
This speciication is based on an estimated top load of up to 320 users 
on the system. Computers with more than 16 GB of memory will require 
more disk space for paging, hibernation, and dump iles.
Microsoft-deined hardware requirements for Dynamics CRM Server 2011 can be found at:
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh699840.aspx
The recommended operating systems for Dynamics CRM 2011 Server are Windows  
Server 2008 (Standard/Enterprise/Datacenter editions), Windows Server 2008 R2,  
Windows Small Business Server (Premium/Standard), and Windows Small Business  
Server (Standard/Essential Update Rollup 13 of Dynamics CRM 2013 also supports  
Windows Server 2012.).

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
10
Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0 or 7.5, along with Indexing Service, IIS Admin service, 
and World Wide Web Publishing Service (W3SVC), need to be installed and running. 
Windows Data Access Components (Windows DAC) 6.0, and Microsoft ASP.NET 4 are  
also required for the installation of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server.
The Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server machine must be a domain member of a domain 
that is running in one of these Active Directory directory service domain modes: Windows 
2000 (Mixed/Native), Windows Server 2003 (Interim/Native), and Windows Server 2008 
(Interim/Native).
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 only supports the x64 version of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 
with SP1 (Standard/Enterprise/Datacenter editions) / Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 (x64 
version). Update Rollup 6 (and higher) also supports SQL Server 2012 (Enterprise/Business 
Intelligence/Standard versions).
Active/Active SQL Server clustering is supported in Dynamics  
CRM Server 2011 from Update Rollup 1 onwards but not as a  
load-balancing coniguration.
Other than that, 32-bit versions of SQL Server and SQL Server 
Reporting Services (SSRS) are not supported.

Installing Dynamics CRM Server
The installation of the on-premises version of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 involves a little 
more than the standard Microsoft wizard process. Here we will discuss how to install the  
on-premises version on a single-server machine.
Getting ready
Microsoft Dynamics CRM is designed so that its components (Application Service, 
Deployment Service, Sandbox Processing Service, and Asynchronous Processing Service) 
can run under separate identities. It is recommended that you use separate Active Directory 
accounts for running these components and SQL Server Reporting Services. Additionally, 
these accounts should be set up as service accounts in Active Directory and should only be 
granted the permissions necessary to enable a particular component to function. By this,  
we can help secure the system and reduce the likelihood of exploitation.

Chapter 1
11
Managed service accounts, introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2, 
are not supported for running Microsoft Dynamics CRM services.
We will now take a look into these identity accounts and the privileges to be granted to 
them for proper functioning. It is very important to set up these accounts before starting the 
installation of Dynamics CRM 2011. After the installation of Dynamics CRM, these accounts 
should not be added to Dynamics CRM as users. This might create authentication issues 
and unexpected behavior in the application. These service accounts should be granted the 
following permissions:
 
f
Application service account:
 

Should be a member of the Active Directory Domain Users group and the 
local machine's Performance Log Users group
 

Should have administrative access on the computers that are running 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM website and SQL Server
 

The service account may need a service principal number (SPN) for the URL 
used to access the website that is associated with it
By default, websites using IIS7.0 or later versions 
are configured to use kernel-mode authentication. 
When a Microsoft Dynamics CRM website is run 
using the Kernel-Mode authentication, SPNs for the 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Application Pool identities 
are not required.
 
f
Deployment Web service account:
 

Should be a member of the Active Directory Domain Users group
 

Must be granted the Logon as service permission in Local Security Policy
 

Should have administrative access on the computers where Dynamics CRM 
2011 Deployment Web Service and SQL Server are running
 

Should have sysadmin permission on the instance of SQL Server to be used 
for the configuration and organization databases
 

The service account may need an SPN for the URL used to access the 
website associated with it

f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Asynchronous Processing service account:
 

Should be a member of the Active Directory Domain Users group
 

Should be a member of the Performance Log Users group
 

Must be granted the Logon as service permission in Local Security Policy
 

The service account may need an SPN for the URL used to access the 
website associated with it
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Sandbox Processing service account:
 

Should be a member of the Active Directory Domain Users group.
 

Must be granted the Logon as service permission in the Local  
Security Policy.
 

The service account may need an SPN for the URL used to access the 
website associated with it. To set the SPN for the Sandbox Processing  
service account, run the following command at the command prompt  
on the computer where the service is running:
SETSPN –a MSCRMSandboxService/<ComputerName> <service 
account>
Replace <ComputerName> with the name of the computer running this 
service and <serviceaccount> with the name of the service account.
 
f
Dynamics CRM 2011 Installation User account:
 

Should be a member of the Active Directory Domain User group.
 

Should have administrative access on the computer where the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 setup will be run.
 

Should have read and write permissions to the local Program Files folder.
 

Should have administrative access on the computer where the instance of 
SQL Server that will be used to store the Microsoft Dynamics CRM databases 
is located.
 

Should have sysadmin membership on the instance of SQL Server that will 
be used to store the Microsoft Dynamics CRM databases.
 

Should have organization and security group creation permission in the 
Active Directory directory service.

Chapter 1


If Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services is installed on a different server, 
the Content Manager role must be added at the root level for installing  
the user account. We must also add the System Administrator role at the 
site-wide level for the installation of the user account. Also make sure  
that port 80 (the default port on which Reporting Services is installed) 
accepts connections.
How to do it...
In the previous sections we have discussed the minimum recommended software and 
hardware speciications and service account requirements. Now we will discuss how to  
install Dynamics CRM Server components on a single-server machine.
During the installation, if a machine restart is requested by the setup, it is recommended that 
one selects the Restart option before proceeding with the installation.
It is usually recommended that one creates separate organization units (OUs) for each CRM 
deployment, especially for production or production-like deployment environments. Dynamics 
CRM 2011 Server installer creates security groups within the speciied OU, and hence, it is 
advisable to create separate OUs for deployment isolation purposes.
Follow these steps to install Dynamics CRM 2011 Server in a single-server machine:
1. Log in to the machine using the installation user account setup using the 
recommended privileges.
2. Run the Dynamics CRM 2011 setup.
Alternatively, navigate to the installation directory for Dynamics CRM 2011 Server and 
run the Dynamics CRM 2011 setup ile at \Server\amd64\SetupServer.exe.
3. It is recommended that you run the setup using the Run as Administrator option by 
right-clicking on the .exe ile.
4. On the Welcome to Microsoft Dynamics CRM Setup page, select Get updates for 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM (recommended) in the latest update rollups that have to 
be applied during the installation; otherwise, select Do not get updates. Press Next 
to continue.
It is recommended that you assess the impact of the update rollups before applying 
them because they can break any existing code or the rollup itself can have defects.
5. On the Product Key Information page, enter the product key.
6. On the Accept License page, accept the license agreement.

7. 
If the setup detects that a few of the required components are missing, the Install 
Required Components page will appear. The missing required components can 
be installed by clicking on Install. When the components are installed, the status 
column will change from Not Installed to Installed and we can click on Next to 
continue as shown in the following screenshot:
8. The Select Installation Location page provides us with the option of choosing the 
installation directory. Accept the default location or enter a different ile installation 
location, and then click on Next.
9. The Specify Server Roles page appears. By default, Full Server is selected. For a 
single-server deployment, we will go with the Full Server option.

Chapter 1
15
10. On the Specify Deployment Options page, select the Create a new deployment 
option. In the Enter or select the name of the computer that is running SQL Server 
to use with the deployment box, type or select the instance of SQL Server that will be 
used to store Dynamics CRM 2011 databases.
In case there already exists an MSCRM_CONFIG database from a previous CRM 
deployment that is intended to be used here, select the Connect to, and if 
necessary, upgrade an existing deployment option. But, if an MSCRM_CONFIG 
database does not exist in the SQL Server instance, an error will occur.
11. On the Select the Organizational Unit page, click on Browse to display the 
Active Directory structure. Select the location where the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
organizational unit is to be installed, click on OK, and then click on Next.
Four Microsoft Dynamics CRM-speciic security groups will be created in this 
organizational unit. To know more about these groups, read the How it works… 
section of this recipe.

12. In the Specify Service Accounts page, select the service accounts for the Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM services and then click on Next as shown in the following screenshot:
13. On the Select Web Site page, select the website that will host the Dynamics CRM 
web application. Here we can use the default website (port 80) or any other  
existing websites.
Unless there is a valid reason for not installing the application 
in the default website, leave it as it is because among other 
advantages, it will be much easier for users to access the website 
as they won't have to remember another port number. If we select 
a network port other than the default port, we have to ensure that 
the firewall does not block the port.
If you decide to create a new website, select the Create new Web site option; the 
setup creates a new website for Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server 2011. We can 
specify the port number by typing the TCP port number that Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
clients will use to connect to Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server 2011. The default port 
number is 5555.
14. Click on Next> to proceed:

15. On the Specify E-mail Router Settings page, specify the name or IP address of the 
machine where E-mail Router will be installed. If E-mail Router is not to be installed, 
this information can be left blank. Click on Next to proceed.
We will discuss how to install E-mail Router later 
in this chapter.
16. On the Specify Organization Settings page, we have to specify the following details:
 

Name of the CRM Organization in the Display Name textbox. Usually the 
organization name represents the company name, but the organization 
name has to be properly thought through as, once deployed, this name 
cannot be changed.
 

The Unique Database Name value will be generated from the organization 
name specified above it. In most cases, we should proceed with this 
generated name as it becomes easy in the future to recognize the database 
linked to a CRM Organization in the database server. But this name can be 
changed and a new name of up to 30 characters can be provided
 

Under ISO Currency code, click on Browse and select a base currency.
Once the CRM Organization is created, the base currency code 
cannot be updated, though the base currency name and base 
currency symbol can be changed.
Base currency has been explained in the There's more... 
section of this recipe.

In the SQL collation list, we can leave the default selection or select a 
different database collation that the organization database will use to sort 
and compare data characters.
The default SQL collation changes based on the base language selection of 
the deployment. The collation settings cannot be changed after installation.
SQL Server Collation refers to a set of rules that is used to 
determine how character data is sorted and compared. Collation 
encodes the rules governing the proper use of characters for 
either a language, such as Greek or Polish, or an alphabet, 
such as Latin1_General (the Latin alphabet used by Western 
European languages).
More information about SQL Server Collation can be found at:

17. On the Specify Reporting Services Server page, please type the Reporting Server 
URL. Please verify the URL in a separate browser window. Please note that the 
Reporting Server URL should be speciied here and not the Reporting Manager  
URL. Click on Next to proceed.
18. On the Help Us Improve the Customer Experience page, select whether you want  
to participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program, and then click  
on Next.
19. On the Select Microsoft Update Preference page, indicate whether to use Microsoft 
Update to keep CRM Server 2011 updated.
Automatic rollup update is not recommended, and 
before applying any update rollup we have to be very 
sure (by trying the rollup in a test environment) that it 
does not break existing functionality and that the update 
rollup itself is not broken.
20. Click on Next to proceed.
21. Next is the System Checks page, which outlines a summary of all requirements and 
recommendations for successful installation.
If there are any errors or warnings, they will be listed here. We have to rectify all  
errors before proceeding further. Warnings, however, can be ignored, but it is  
strongly suggested that you rectify the warnings as they may cause issues later  
on in the system.
22. Click on Next to proceed.
23. Next, we have the Service Disruption Warning page. This page indicates all services 
that can be stopped or restarted during installation. Click on Next to proceed.
24. Review the Ready to Install Microsoft Dynamics CRM page, and click on Back to 
correct any setting to proceed warning free. When we are ready to continue, click  
on Install.
25. If installation completes successfully, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server setup 
completed page appears.
26. To install Dynamics CRM, we must click on Finish and wait until the server  
is restarted.

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011

How it works…
In this recipe we have installed Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 on a single-server machine. 
During the process, the installer creates four security groups in Active Directory; these 
groups are fundamental for Dynamics CRM's functioning. Usually it is left to the installer to 
create these groups, but these groups can be precreated manually and can be used during 
the Dynamics CRM installation. If these groups do not already exist in Active Directory, the 
installation user must have Active Directory rights to create them. The following are the groups 
that will get created during installation:
Group
Description
PrivReportingGroup This is the privileged Microsoft Dynamics CRM user group for 
reporting functions. It is configured during the setup of Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM Reporting Extensions.
PrivUserGroup
This is the privileged Microsoft Dynamics CRM user group for special 
administrative functions, including the CRMAppPool identity (domain 
user or NetworkService).
SQLAccessGroup
This group pertains to all server processes / service accounts that 
require access to SQL Server, including the CRMAppPool identity 
(domain user or NetworkService). Members of this group have the 
db_owner permission on Microsoft Dynamics CRM databases.
ReportingGroup
All Microsoft Dynamics CRM users are included in this group. This 
group is updated automatically as users are added and removed from 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM. By default, all Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
Reporting Services reports grant the Browse permission to  
this group.
One more important point to be noted here is that the four service accounts used during 
installation and the SQL access accounts are part of some or all of the aforementioned Active 
Directory groups. The following matrix will explain the group membership of these accounts:

The performance log user group is a local group on each server and 
not a domain group.
For Dynamics CRM to function properly, these service accounts will have to have the  
following rights:
 
f
Folder read and write permission on the Trace folder, by default located under 
\%Program Files%\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\, and the %AppData% folder  
of the user account on the local computer
 
f
Read and write permission to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\
MSCRM and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\services\
MSCRMSandboxService subkeys in the Windows Registry
 
f
The Application service account and Deployment Web service account should also be 
part of the CRM_WPG group
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 uses a list of ports, and these ports have to be allowed in the 
irewall for CRM to function. The following matrix lists all these ports:

Each of these service accounts runs a speciic component within the Dynamics CRM 2011 
Server infrastructure. The following outlines how these service accounts are used within 
Dynamics CRM 2011:
 
f
Application service account: The installation of Dynamics CRM 2011 creates a 
separate application pool (CRMAppPool) in IIS to isolate the CRM application for 
better security, reliability, availability, and performance and to keep running without 
impacting other web applications hosted in the same IIS. The Application service 
account is used by Dynamics CRM 2011 to run the CRM application pool in IIS.
 
f
Deployment Web service account: Dynamics CRM 2011 uses this service account to 
run Deployment Web Service, which is responsible for deployment-related activities 
such as:
 

Creating, importing, updating, upgrading, enabling, and disabling of  
CRM Organizations
 

Retrieving Microsoft Dynamics CRM license information for a deployment
 

Adding or removing deployment administrators
 

Enabling, disabling, or deleting servers
 

Updating deployment configuration settings
 

Enumerating and changing the state of servers in the deployment
The Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 deployment service is 
not backward compatible. Any component, developed using 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4.0 Deployment Web Service has 
to be upgraded to use the Dynamics CRM 2011 deployment 
service to work within Dynamics CRM 2011 deployment.
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Asynchronous Processing service account: This service 
account is used to run the Asynchronous Processing Service, which is responsible 
for executing long-running operations independent of the main Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM system process. This results in an improved overall system performance and 
improved scalability. The asynchronous service features a managed queue for the 
execution of asynchronous registered plugins, worklows, and operations such as  
bulk mail, bulk import, and campaign activity propagation. These operations are 
registered with the asynchronous service and executed later when the service 
processes its queue.
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Sandbox Processing service account: Dynamics CRM 
2011 uses this service account to run Sandbox Processing Service, which enables an 
isolated environment to allow the execution of custom codes, for example, plugins. 
Such an isolated environment reduces the possibility of custom code, affecting the 
operation of the organizations in the production Dynamics CRM 2011 deployment.

Chapter 1
23
It is worth installing the Sandbox Processing Service role onto a dedicated server 
on a separate virtual LAN (VLAN) from other computers that are running Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM roles. This network isolation strategy can help protect other Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 resources from being compromised if there is a malicious 
plugin running in the sandbox.
Once the installation has completed, its success can be veriied by accessing the CRM 
server URL. The URL would be in the format http://<servername>:<port _
number>/<organization_name>/main.aspx.
Here, we will replace <servername> with the name of the Dynamics CRM 2011  
server, <port_number> with the port used by Dynamics CRM 2011 Server, and 
<organization_name> with the CRM Organization that was created during installation.
If installation is successful, the Dynamics CRM landing page will appear in the browser 
window as shown in the following screenshot:
There's more…
Before we end this recipe, let's take look at some information on the use of currency codes in 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011:
Dynamics CRM 2011 is a multicurrency system that allows a user to perform any inancial 
transaction using their own currency, known as transaction currency. During installation, 
a primary or default currency has to be selected. This currency is the de facto currency for 
inancial transactions within a CRM Organization and known as the base currency. After 
deining a base currency for the organization, we have to deine exchange rates to associate 
the base currency with transaction currencies.

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
24
Each currency record has three parts describing the currency:
 
f
The name of the currency
 
f
The symbol that is used to represent the currency, such as $ (dollar), £ (pound),  
€ (euro), or ¥ (yen)
 
f
The exchange rate with the base currency
Any transaction in other currencies will automatically be converted to the base currency,  
using the exchange rate deined in the record for that currency, in the Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM database.
The base currency of a CRM Organization has to be selected carefully as:
 
f
The base currency is used as the basis to calculate additional currencies that can 
be used for transaction-based records. Hence, the native currency of the CRM 
Organization users is usually chosen as the base currency to avoid too many  
currency conversions.
 
f
Financial reporting is done based on the base currency.
The supported currency code details can be found at:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh699729.aspx
We have seen that, in the process of a single-server installation, all the server roles of 
Dynamics CRM 2011 are installed onto one single machine. But in a multiserver deployment, 
the server roles are usually separately deployed on multiple machines. We will ind out more 
about multiserver Dynamics CRM deployments in the latter parts of this chapter.
Installing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
Reporting Extensions
While Microsoft Dynamics CRM Reporting Extensions is not absolutely required to run 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011, without Reporting Server installed, certain important 
functionalities of Dynamics CRM will not function. For example, the reporting functionality will 
not function and creating a new organization and organization import will be blocked until the 
extensions are installed and conigured.
The Microsoft Dynamics CRM Reporting Extensions setup includes two data processing 
extensions: Fetch data processing extension and SQL data processing extension.  
These extensions are installed by default during Microsoft Dynamics CRM Reporting 
Extensions setup.
While the Fetch data processing extension is required to create, run, and schedule  
Fetch-based reports, the SQL data processing extension is required to run and schedule  
the default (out of box) or SQL-based custom reports in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011.

Chapter 1
25
Getting ready
Before we start installing Microsoft Dynamics CRM Reporting Extensions, Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM Server setup must be complete.
Dynamics CRM Reporting Extensions can only be installed for one instance of SQL Server 
Reporting Services on a computer. In addition, different deployments of Dynamics CRM 2011 
cannot share a single SQL Server Reporting Services server; however, a multitenant CRM 
deployment can use the same instance of Reporting Services.
The Microsoft Dynamics CRM Reporting Extensions setup must be run on a computer that has 
Microsoft SQL Server 2012/2008 Reporting Services installed. The user account to be used 
in order to install Reporting Extensions:
 
f
Must have appropriate rights on the organization databases
 
f
Must be the local machine administrator
The Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) should be running under a separate 
Active Directory service account. This account should be added to two of the Dynamics CRM-
speciic Active Directory groups, namely, PrivUserGroup and PrivReportingUserGroup. 
However, this account should not be part of SQLAccessGroup. This account should not be 
set up as Local Service as well.
Reporting Extensions should be installed on that Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services 
instance which is being used by the CRM Organization. Otherwise, reports will not function. 
In addition to that, the base language of CRM Organization and that of CRM Reporting 
Extensions has to be the same.
How to do it…
Please follow these steps to install Microsoft Dynamics CRM Reporting Extensions:
1. Run the setup utility, or alternatively, navigate to the installation directory 
for Dynamics CRM 2011 Server located at the route \Server\amd64\
SrsDataConnector\SetupSrsDataConnector.exe.
2. It is recommended that you run the setup using the Run as Administrator option by 
right-clicking on the .exe ile.
3. Like the Dynamics CRM 2011 installer, this setup also asks whether we want to 
check if updates are available for download and apply before proceeding with  
the installation.
It is recommended that you assess the impact of the update rollups before  
applying it because update rollups can break any existing code or the rollup  
itself can have defects.

4. On the License Agreement page, select I accept this license agreement and click 
on I Accept to proceed.
5. On the Install Required Components page, the installer automatically identiies 
the components that need to be installed and allows you to install them . This page 
will not appear if all the required components are already installed. If something is 
missing, it can be installed by clicking on the Install button. When the components 
are installed, the Status column will change from Missing to Installed and we can 
click on Next to continue.
6. On the Specify Coniguration Database Server page, please enter the instance of 
the SQL Server.
Now if we are using the default instance of the SQL Server, enter the name of the 
computer that is running SQL Server and contains the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
coniguration database named MSCRM_CONFIG, and if we are using the named 
instance of SQL Server then enter <machine-name>\<instance-name>:
7. 
On the Specify SSRS Instance Name page, select a Microsoft SQL Server Reporting 
Services instance that will be used for Microsoft Dynamics CRM reporting, and then 
click on Next as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
27
8. On the Select Microsoft Update Preference page, select the Use Microsoft Update 
when I check for updates option if updates have to be applied automatically. 
Proceed by clicking on Next.
9. On the Select Installation Location page, browse to specify where it will be installed.
10. Then the System Checks page appears with a summary of the requirements for 
a successful CRM Reporting Extensions installation. All errors must be resolved to 
continue. If no errors and/or only warnings appear, the installation can continue. 
Click on Next to proceed.
11. Then you will see the Ready to Install Microsoft Dynamics CRM Reporting 
Extensions page, which provides us with an overview of the system parameters in 
order to proceed with it. If you agree, simply click on Install to begin the installation.
12. When the setup is completed successfully, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Reporting 
Extensions Setup Completed page appears. Click on Finish. The reports will be 
published for the default organization.
How it works…
This recipe installs the Fetch and SQL data processing extensions on the Microsoft SQL Server 
Reporting Services server. It is recommended that the SSRS instance be run on a server 
separate from the one which has hosted the Dynamics CRM databases.
SQL Server Reporting Services should be running on a service account that is not part 
of SQLAccessGroup; in case it does, the Reporting Extensions installer throws an error 
message, A Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server component is using the same account as the 
instance of SQL Server Reporting Services. Usually, it happens when the account is used to 
run the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server components is also used to run the SQL Server Reporting 
Services. It is recommended that you use a separate account to run the SQL Server Reporting 
Services to reduce security vulnerability.

With Dynamics CRM Reporting Extensions installed, all the default CRM reports will  
start working and custom SQL bad Fetch-based reports can now be created, uploaded,  
and scheduled.
Post the reporting extensions installation, log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 and run any  
of the out-of-the-box reports. This can be done by navigating to Workplace | Reports.  
If Reporting Extensions has been successfully installed, the out-of-the-box reports will  
function successfully.

sample data.
Installing Dynamics CRM for Outlook
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 can also be accessed via a familiar Microsoft Outlook client. 
To access Dynamics CRM via Outlook, the Dynamics CRM Outlook client has to be installed 
on the client machine. If a machine is used by multiple users, Microsoft Dynamics CRM for 
Outlook has to be conigured for each user.
Getting ready
Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook can be installed with either the online or ofline 
capability. Ofline access enables a user to access Dynamics CRM data even when  
he or she is not connected to Dynamics CRM Server.

Chapter 1
29
The Microsoft-recommended software and hardware requirements for the machine where 
Dynamics CRM for Outlook has to be installed are as follows:
Component
Recommended specification
Processor (32-bit)
Multicore 1.8 GHz CPU or higher
Processor (64-bit)
Multicore x64 architecture 2 GHz CPU or higher, such as AMD 
Opteron or Intel Xeon systems
Memory
4 GB of RAM or more
Hard disk
2 GB of available hard disk space and 7200 RPM or more
Display
Super VGA with a resolution higher than 1024 x 768
Actual requirements and product functionality may vary based on the system 
coniguration and operating system.
Additionally, Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook using the ofline capability increases the 
need for a higher speciication of hardware, which can include processor, memory, hard disk, 
and network throughput. For a successful network installation, a minimum network bandwidth 
of 300 kbps or higher is required.

permitted on this machine, the files can be downloaded elsewhere and then 
copied here.
After downloading the package, start the installation process by double-
clicking on the downloaded EXE ile. The irst step would be to specify the 
location to which the package content would be unzipped.
3. Post unzipping, locate the unzipped files and then double-click on the 
SetupClient.exe file. Alternatively, log in to the machine without 
administrative permissions, right-click on the SetupClient.exe file,  
and select Run as Administrator by supplying the administrator password.
The Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for Microsoft Ofice Outlook setup wizard 
will be launched.
4. On the License Agreement page, select I accept the license agreement, 
and then click on Next.
5. On the Get Recommended Updates page, indicate whether to obtain 
updates through Microsoft Update, and then click on Next.
It is recommended that you assess the impact of the update rollups before 
applying them because update rollups can break any existing code or the 
rollup itself can have defects.
6. Next, you will see the Select the Installation screen. Here, select the Install 
Now option, if Outlook with online access has to be installed, and Options,  
if Outlook with offline access has to be installed.

Please follow these steps to conigure Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook:
1. When Outlook is restarted after Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook has 
been installed, the configuration wizard starts automatically.
If you do not intend to conigure Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook 
immediately after installing it, click on Cancel on the Conigure Organization 
page of the wizard. A Conigure Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook 
button then appears on the Microsoft Outlook toolbar and will remain there 
until we conigure Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook. We also can start 
the coniguration wizard by clicking on the Conigure Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM for Outlook button.
If the coniguration wizard does not start automatically, you can manually 
launch it by clicking on Start | All Programs | Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
2011 | Coniguration Wizard.

Coniguring user e-mail settings:
Outlook can be used to send and receive e-mails, and in this case, E-mail Router is 
not required. By default, the incoming and outgoing e-mail access types are set to 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook in Dynamics CRM. If it is changed, Outlook will 
be unable to send and receive e-mails.
If the incoming and outgoing e-mail access types have been changed, these can be 
reset using the following steps:
1. Log in to Dynamics CRM as a system administrator.
2. Navigate to Settings | Administration | Users, select the user record,  
and open it.
3. On the user record, modify the incoming and outgoing e-mail  
access types to Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook as shown  
in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1

How it works…
Once Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook is installed on a user's computer, Dynamics  
CRM-related toolbar or ribbon changes will be relected in the Outlook application. Dynamics 
CRM 2011 can be accessed by using the Microsoft Outlook shortcut bars, ribbon, and folder 
navigation. Installing Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook also creates a toolbar in Microsoft 
Outlook and a folder in the structure of the user's mailbox.
In the following screenshot, we can see how Microsoft Dynamics CRM has been accessed in 
the Microsoft Outlook 2003 client:
Installing a Dynamics CRM language pack
Dynamics CRM 2011 supports multiple languages. In this recipe, we will discuss how to  
apply additional language packs after Dynamics CRM 2011 (base language version) has  
been installed.

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
36
Getting ready
The user account that will be used to run the language pack should have local administrative 
rights on the machine. The language pack for Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 enables users 
to change the CRM user interface language or Help Text. It is important to note that the 
language pack must be installed on both Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server as well  
as client machines that are using Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook. The supported 
languages are as follows:
Arabic
Dutch
Hungarian
Portuguese (Portugal)
Basque
English
Italian
Romanian
Bulgarian
Estonian
Japanese
Russian
Catalan
Finnish
Kazakh
Slovak
Chinese (Hong Kong 
SAR)
French
Korean
Slovenian
Chinese (Simplified)
Galician
Latvian
Spanish
Chinese (Traditional)
German
Lithuanian
Swedish
Croatian
Greek
Norwegian
Thai
Czech
Hebrew
Polish
Turkish
Danish
Hindi
Portuguese (Brazil)
Ukrainian
For users who are running Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Microsoft Ofice 
Outlook, in addition to installing the language pack on the computer 
running Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server 2011, the same language 
pack has to be installed on the computer where Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM for Outlook is installed.
How to do it…
The language pack deployment has the following two steps:
1. Installing the language pack
2. Provisioning the language pack
The following steps are required to be followed to install the Dynamics CRM language pack:
1. Log on to the computer where Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server 2011 or Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM for Outlook is installed.

Chapter 1
37
Download Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Language Pack from the Microsoft website 
(http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27819). 
Before downloading, we should select the correct language in the Change Language 
drop-down list. If download is not permitted on this machine, it can be downloaded 
elsewhere and then copied onto this machine.
To run the installer, the logged-in user must have administrator privileges on the 
computer and either full or administrator privileges on Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
2. After downloading the package, start the installation by double-clicking on the 
downloaded EXE ile. The irst step would be to specify the location to which the 
package content will be unzipped.
3. Post unzipping, locate the language pack iles and then double-click on the 
MUISetup_<loc_code>_<proc_type>.msi ile, where <loc_ code> is the 
locale code for the language pack being installed (for example, 1033 for English or 
3082 for Spanish), and <proc_type> speciies the type of processor the server is 
running on (for example, "amd64").
4. On the End User License Agreement page, click on I accept the terms in the 
license agreement, and then click on Install.
5. Installation continues; once done, please click on Finish.
To provision the language pack in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM deployment, perform the 
following steps:
1. After installation, log in to the Dynamics CRM application with system administrator 
security privileges. Navigate to Settings | System | Administration | Languages as 
shown in the following screenshot:
www.allitebooks.com

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
38
2. This will launch a new web dialog, where the language (in this example, Spanish) can 
be selected:
3. Then, click on the Apply button to enable the language pack. A conirmation dialog 
(Conirm Language Change) will appear; please click on OK and continue.
4. Once done, the language pack's Status ield must change to Enabled.
5. The previous step only enables the language. Now the language change at the user 
interface level has to be effected. This can be done by navigating to File | Options for 
every user login:
6. In the options window, navigate to the Languages tab. Change the User Interface 
Language and Help Language ields to the newly enabled language (in this  
case, Spanish):

Chapter 1
39
7. 
Click on the OK button to apply the changes.
How it works…
The language pack installs a translation package of the labels, text, and help content of the 
Dynamics CRM user interface. While the base language deines the default Dynamics CRM UI 
language, the language packs further installed can provide lexibility to users to select another 
language of their choice. This is often a very important feature of Dynamics CRM when there 
is a use case of deploying Dynamics CRM for a multilingual user base.
In Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook, the user language settings only apply to Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM for Outlook features, such as the user interface display of the CRM menu;  
they do not affect other areas of Microsoft Ofice Outlook.

Installing Microsoft Dynamics CRM E-mail 
Router
Microsoft Dynamics CRM E-mail Router creates an interface between a Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM deployment and the organization's messaging system. E-mail Router performs the 
following tasks:
 
f
Routing incoming e-mail messages to Microsoft Dynamics CRM
 
f
Sending e-mail messages generated from Microsoft Dynamics CRM
E-mail Router is for users or queues that do not use Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook. If 
CRM Organization uses e-mail queues, E-mail Router must be used because queues are not 
supported by using Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook.
With E-mail Router, an e-mail is routed to Microsoft Dynamics CRM regardless of whether the 
recipient is logged in.
E-mail Router routes qualiied e-mail messages to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM system as 
e-mail activities and fully integrates with different messaging systems, such as Microsoft 
Exchange Server, Microsoft Exchange Online, POP3, and SMTP. E-mail Router includes the 
functionality of sending e-mails through any desired SMTP provider and receiving e-mails from 
Microsoft Exchange Server or from a POP3 server.
 Getting ready
The minimum recommended hardware speciications for the server machine where E-mail 
Router will be installed are as follows:
 
f
A multi-core 1.8 GHz processor
 
f
2 GB of RAM or more
 
f
A minimum of 100 MB of available hard disk space
E-mail Router components can be installed on a machine that runs on Windows 7 (32- or  
64-bit editions), and on Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2 (x64-bit  
editions only).
Running Microsoft Dynamics CRM E-mail Router and the E-mail 
Router Coniguration Manager application (32-bit) is not 
supported on a Windows Server 64-bit operating system in the 
Windows on Windows (WOW) mode.
Finally, Rule Deployment Wizard requires the Microsoft Exchange Server Messaging API 
(MAPI) client libraries.

Chapter 1
41
For Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, MAPI Version 6.5.8147 (or later) is 
required. If an earlier version is installed, it has to be uninstalled before 
installing the newer version.
Download the latest MAPI client from:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.
aspx?id=1004
This package, however, will not be installed on a system on which any version 
of Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 or earlier is installed.
Update Rollup 2 (or later) of Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 is also a 
requirement if Rule Deployment Wizard is intended to use Microsoft 
Exchange Server 2010 as its e-mail server.
Microsoft does not recommend installing E-mail Router on a computer that is 
running Microsoft Exchange Server.
The minimum permissions required to run E-mail Router are:
 
f
The account that is running E-mail Router must be LocalSystemAccount
 
f
The computer where E-mail Router will be installed must be added to the 
PrivUserGroup group
How to do it…
Follow these steps to set up E-mail Router component:
1. Log in to the server machine where E-mail Router has to be installed with local 
administrative privileges.
2. Download Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 E-mail Router from the Microsoft website 
(http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=27818). 
If downloading is not permitted on this machine, this can be downloaded elsewhere 
and then copied onto this machine.
3. After downloading the package, start the installation by double-clicking on the 
downloaded EXE ile. The irst step would be to specify the location to which the 
package content will be unzipped.
4. After unzipping, locate the unzipped iles and then double-click on the 
SetupEmailRouter.exe ile.
5. If a Security Warning page pops up, proceed by clicking on Run.
6. Then a Welcome to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 E-mail Router Setup page 
appears. Select Get Updates for Microsoft Dynamics CRM if Dynamics CRM  
update rollups have to be applied; otherwise, select Do not get updates and  
then click on Next.

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
42
It is recommended that you assess the impact of the update 
rollups before applying them because update rollups can 
break any existing code or the rollup itself can have defects.
7. 
When the License Agreement page appears, select I accept this license agreement 
to accept the license terms and click on I Accept.
8. If the required components are missing, the Download and Install Required 
Components page appears. If this page does not appear, all required components 
are installed and the next step in the installation procedure can be skipped.
If the required components are listed, they can be installed now. Click on Install to 
launch the installation. After the components are installed, the Status column value 
changes from Not Installed to Installed. Click on Next to continue.
Some of these components might require an Internet 
connectivity on the server machine in case the prerequisite 
binary files are not found on the local machine.
9. On the Select Router Components page, select either one or both options and then 
click on Next:
 

The Microsoft Dynamics CRM E-mail Router Service option installs the 
E-mail Router service and the E-mail Router configuration manager
 

The Rule Deployment Wizard option installs Rule Deployment Wizard. 
Optionally, this wizard can be installed on any computer in the Active 
Directory domain of the Exchange Server.

Chapter 1
43
On the Select Router Components page, if we clear the 
option of a component that has already been installed, 
that component will be uninstalled.
10. On the Select Install Location page, accept either the default ile installation 
directory or browse to indicate a different location, and then click on Next.
11. The System Checks page appears. This page displays a summary of all system 
requirements for a successful E-mail Router installation. Any reported error must be 
corrected before proceeding with installation. If there is a problem that will take time 
to be solved, setup has to be cancelled at this point; the problem has to be ixed and 
only then can setup be restarted.
When no veriication errors remain, click on Next.
12. The Ready to Install page appears. The installation selections made have to be 
reviewed; click on Back to change any selections, or click on Install to install now.
13. After the E-mail Router setup has inished installing iles, click on Finish.
How it works…
The setup for E-mail Router for Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 contains two main components:
 
f
E-mail Router (the E-mail Router service and the E-mail Router coniguration manager)
 
f
Rule Deployment Wizard
Rule Deployment Wizard lets us deploy rules that are used to route e-mail messages to a 
forward mailbox from the mailbox of a user or queue. Rule Deployment Wizard does not  
work with POP3/SMTP e-mail servers.
Users and queues in CRM can be conigured to use E-mail Router for processing of the 
incoming and outgoing CRM e-mails. To utilize this functionality, users and queues must  
have a valid e-mail address and must select E-mail Router for the incoming and outgoing 
E-mail access types. This can be set up by an administrator or by users having the  
relevant permissions.
There's more...
E-mail Router can also be installed on a multiserver cluster to provide high availability and 
failover functionality. We will discuss this in the Installing Microsoft Dynamics CRM E-mail 
Router on multiple computers recipe later in this chapter.

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
44
After E-mail Router is installed, the E-mail Router coniguration manager, an application that 
is installed during the Microsoft Dynamics CRM E-mail Router setup, must be run. We will 
discuss this in the next recipe.
Coniguring Microsoft Dynamics E-mail 
Router
After installing E-mail Router, it has to be conigured. Certain coniguration tasks are 
mandatory; whereas a few are optional. The coniguration tasks can be listed as follows:
 
f
Task 1 (Mandatory): Setup proiles are (optionally) set up deployments using the 
E-mail Router coniguration manager
 
f
Task 2 (Mandatory): Dynamics CRM users must have their incoming e-mail access 
type set to E-mail Router
 
f
Task 3 (Optional): We can set up the forward mailbox
 
f
Task 4 (Optional): As part of coniguration, inbox rules can also be deployed
E-mail Router has several options, and before running the E-mail Router coniguration 
manager, we need to be certain about the choices to be made here:
 
f
Incoming coniguration: For incoming e-mail messages, E-mail Router supports the 
Exchange Server 2003/2007 or POP3 e-mail systems
 
f
Outgoing coniguration: For outgoing e-mail messages, E-mail Router supports SMTP 
e-mail systems
 
f
Mailbox monitoring type:
Two types of mailbox monitoring can be conigured, they are as follows:
 

Forward mailbox: Forward mailbox, also known as sink mailbox, allows 
Dynamics CRM to monitor one central mailbox instead of monitoring 
the mailbox of each user who needs Microsoft Dynamics CRM e-mail 
capabilities. CRM Organizations, which has a large number of mailboxes to 
monitor, can opt for this alternative.
 

E-mail Router: If e-mail messages can be forwarded as attachments but the 
e-mail system does not allow rules, each user must be configured to use the 
E-mail Router setting.
If Exchange Server is used, forward mailbox monitoring is 
recommended.
To use a forward mailbox with a Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
deployment that interfaces with a POP3-compliant e-mail 
system, the e-mail system must be able to forward e-mail 
messages as attachments.

Chapter 1
45
How to do it…
We will take a look at all the previously mentioned tasks one by one:
Task 1 – Setting up proiles
Please follow the ensuing steps to conigure the E-mail Router settings:
1. To start E-mail Router Coniguration Manager, click on Start | All Programs | 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 E-mail Router | E-mail Router Coniguration 
Manager.
The E-mail Router Coniguration Manager application will be launched. It has three 
sections as follows:
 

Configuration Profiles: This section contain information about the e-mail 
server and the authentication methods the E-mail Router will use.
At least one incoming e-mail proile and one outgoing e-mail proile have to 
be conigured to enable E-mail Router to route e-mails to and from Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM Organization.
 

Deployments: For E-mail Router to use the incoming and outgoing 
configuration profiles we just created, it has to be linked with a Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM Deployment.
We have to select from the following options:
 

My company: Select this option if Microsoft Dynamics CRM is deployed  
on premises
 

An online service provider: Select this option if the deployment that E-mail 
Router will connect to is an online service provider deployment of Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM
 

Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online: Select this option to connect E-mail 
Router to a Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online organization
 

Users, Queues, and Forward Mailboxes: Once the configuration profile and 
deployment have been completed, we need to manage the users, queues, 
and forward mailboxes that will be used by E-mail Router.
2. To create a coniguration proile, click on New in the Coniguration Proile tab.

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
46
3. Provide a proile name and then select the intended values for Direction and E-mail 
Server Type. Finally, provide values for Location and Access Credentials as shown in 
the following screenshot.
By repeating steps 2 and 3, multiple incoming and outgoing proiles can be created:
4. To link a Dynamics CRM Deployment, click on New in the Deployment tab.
5. For Deployment Type, select between My company, An online service provider, and 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online.
In the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server box, please provide the Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM Discovery service followed by the organization name, which is case-sensitive.
In the Access Credentials section, please specify the credentials that E-mail Router 
will use to log on to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server.

Chapter 1
47
Use a Local System account if the machine account can be used 
to connect to Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server. In such a case, 
E-mail Router must be in the same domain as the Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM Server and the E-mail Router machine account 
should be added to PrivUserGroup in Active Directory.
Alternatively, the Other Specified account can be used to specify 
the credentials of a user of with the system administrator role to 
connect to Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
In the Incoming coniguration proile ield, select an incoming proile already 
created, and in the Outgoing coniguration proile ield, select an outgoing proile 
already created.
Finally, click on OK to inish the deployment:

6. The next step would be that of loading the users and mailboxes from CRM 
Deployment, and this can be done by clicking on the Load Data button as  
shown in the following screenshot:
Task 3 – Setting up the forward mailbox
1. To set up forward mailboxes, once the data is loaded, click on the Forward Mailboxes 
tab. Click on New to create a new forward mailbox, or click on Modify to change an 
existing forward mailbox.
In the Forward Mailbox dialog box, ill in the following boxes, and then click on OK:
 

Name: This field will bear the name of the forward mailbox.
 

E-mail Address: This field will bear the e-mail address for the  
forward mailbox.
 

Incoming Configuration Profile: This field will bear the name of the 
incoming configuration profile to associate with the forward mailbox.  
We can have multiple forward mailboxes that use different incoming 
configuration profiles.
To delete e-mail messages in the forward mailbox after they have been  
processed by E-mail Router, select the Delete messages in forward mailbox  
after processing option.

Chapter 1
49
2. Finally, click on Publish.
3. Then restart the Microsoft CRM E-mail Router service. To do this, click on Run, type 
services.msc, and then press Enter. Right-click on the Microsoft CRM E-mail 
Router service, and then click on Restart.
Task 2 – Coniguring user e-mail settings
By default, incoming and outgoing e-mail access types in Dynamics CRM are set to Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM for Outlook. Unless this is changed, Outlook will be unable to send and 
receive e-mails.

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
50
To conigure E-mail Router for incoming and outgoing e-mail access types, perform the 
following steps:
1. Log in to Dynamics CRM with system administrator access.
2. Navigate to Settings | Administration | Users, select the user record, and open it.
3. On the user record, modify the incoming and outgoing e-mail access types to  
E-mail Router.
Task 4 – Coniguring rules using Rule Deployment Wizard
To deploy these Microsoft Dynamics CRM user inbox rules, the Rule Deployment Wizard can 
be used. Rule Deployment Wizard can be run at any time to add or change the inbox rules for 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM users.
The Rule Deployment Wizard can only deploy rules to Exchange Server 
mailboxes. The Rule Deployment Wizard cannot be used to deploy rules 
to POP3 e-mail servers.
To run Rule Deployment Wizard, the user must:
 
f
Be logged on as a Microsoft Dynamics CRM user with a security role
 
f
Be a local administrator on the computer on which the wizard is running
 
f
Have Exchange administrative permissions
The following are the steps to run the Rule Deployment Wizard:
1. Navigate to Start | All Programs | Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 E-mail Router 
and click on Rule Deployment Wizard.
2. Click on Next to start the wizard.
3. For Deployment, select a Microsoft Dynamics deployment type.
Enter the URL of the CRM Organization for Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server.
For Access Credentials, provide the correct credentials of a system administrator of 
the Dynamics CRM Organization.

Chapter 1
51
Then click on Next to proceed:
4. Type the e-mail address of the forward mailbox and click on Next to proceed.
5. Select the Microsoft Dynamics CRM user(s) or queues to whom/which we want to 
deploy the rule. Then click on Next.

6. Click on Deploy rule to user mailboxes, and then click on Next.
7. 
After the rules have been deployed, click on Cancel to close the wizard.
How it works…
E-mail Router Coniguration Manager conigures the deployment and enables Dynamics 
CRM users and queues to send and receive e-mail messages. The E-mail Router coniguration 
steps remain the same irrespective of whether E-mail Router is installed on a single machine 
or multiple-machine clusters. With this recipe, the E-mail Router installation activities come to 
a close.
Installing Microsoft Dynamics CRM E-mail 
Router on multiple computers
To install E-mail Router in a failover cluster environment, the minimum requirements are  
as follows:
 
f
At least two Windows servers to support clustering
 
f
A common storage I/O technology between the nodes in the cluster, such as Parallel 
SCSI or Fiber Channel
 
f
Cluster conigured in an active/passive manner; installing E-mail Router on nodes 
operating in an active/active cluster, such as an Exchange Server active/active 
cluster, is not supported.
To install Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 E-mail Router on multiple computers, the following 
main steps have to be followed:
 
f
Installing E-mail Router to the active primary node in the cluster
 
f
Installing E-mail Router to the passive nodes in the cluster
 
f
Creating the generic resource service for the cluster
How to do it…
Please perform the following steps to install E-mail Router to the active node in the cluster:
1. Run the E-mail Router setup in the active primary node in the cluster by following the 
Installing Microsoft Dynamics CRM E-mail Router recipe.
2. Conigure E-mail Router using the E-mail Router Coniguration Manager by following 
the Coniguring Microsoft Dynamics E-mail Router recipe. Verify that E-mail Router  
is routing messages correctly to and from Microsoft Dynamics CRM and the  
e-mail systems.

Chapter 1
53
3. Create shared storage on a secondary node in the cluster and grant full access to the 
service account running the E-mail Router service and those administrators who may 
have to update coniguration iles manually.
By default, the E-mail Router files are located in the folder 
\%Program Files%\Microsoft CRM Email.
4. The following iles have to be copied manually to the shared storage. This is essential 
because these iles can be moved to a secondary node in the cluster in the event  
of a failover.
 

Microsoft.Crm.Tools.EmailAgent.Configuration.bin
 

Microsoft.Crm.Tools.EmailAgent.SystemState.xml
 

Microsoft.Crm.Tools.EmailAgent.xml
 

EncryptionKey.xml (if it exists)
5. Then update the following registry subkey, so that E-mail Router uses the shared 
location to load the E-mail Router settings.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSCRMEmail
6. Finally, restart the Microsoft CRM E-mail Router service.
Next, we will install E-mail Router on each of the passive nodes of the cluster using the 
following steps:
1. Run the E-mail Router setup in the passive node of the cluster.
2. Update the Windows Registry subkey as mentioned in the previous steps on the 
primary node.
3. Restart the Microsoft CRM E-mail Router service.
Finally, we will create a generic resource service for the cluster by following these steps:
1. On each node in the cluster, start the Services MMC snap-in. On the list of services, 
right-click on Microsoft CRM Email Router, click on Properties, and then set Startup 
Type to Manual. Close the Services MMC snap-in.
2. Launch Active Directory Users and Computers. Locate the PrivUserGroup 
{GUID} security group for the deployment. Add the computer accounts for each  
node in the cluster. Close Active Directory Users and Computers.

3. If Windows Server 2003 is used here, start Cluster Administrator—if Windows Server 
2008 is used, start Failover Cluster Management—and create a generic resource 
service. Use the following parameters:
 

Name: Create a descriptive name for the generic resource service, for 
example, MSCRM E-mail Router
 

Resource type: Enter the generic service
 

Group: Enter the cluster group name
 

Possible owners: Add all nodes in the cluster
 

Dependencies: If Exchange Server is used and E-mail Router has been 
installed on Exchange Server (not recommended), add Microsoft Exchange 
Information Store
 

Service Name: Mention the Microsoft CRM E-mail Router service
 

Start Parameters: Leave this field blank
 

Use Network Name for computer name: Leave this field unchecked
 

Do not checkpoint any registry keys
4. Bring the resource online. If it is necessary, conigure the resource 
properties, such as the failover policies.
5. Close the Cluster Administrator/Failover Cluster Management window.
How it works…
We achieve high availability for the Microsoft Dynamics CRM E-mail Router service by 
deploying it on multiple computers by using Windows Server's clustering technology. The 
server cluster has to be conigured in an active/passive manner. In case of an active node 
failover scenario, the passive node becomes the primary node and the common storage or 
shared disk resources will move from active node 1 to the passive node.
Deploying Microsoft Dynamics CRM on 
multiple servers
Earlier, in the Single server versus multiserver subsection of this chapter's Introduction 
section, we mentioned some of the reasons for and beneits of installing Dynamics CRM  
2011 on multiple computers. In this recipe, we will discuss how to deploy Dynamics CRM  
on a multiserver environment.

Chapter 1
55
Getting ready
In a multiple-server deployment, there are usually two or more server computers running  
the Dynamics CRM 2011 Full Server installation. But for improved performance, the server 
roles (Front End Server role, Back End Server role, Deployment Administration Server)  
can further be deployed across different server machines. When Dynamics CRM 2011 is 
deployed across multiple servers, Network Load Balancing (NLB) must be conigured to 
provide load balancing.
In case of deploying various server roles into separate servers, Microsoft's recommendation 
is to not install the Help Server role on the same server where Front End Server roles are 
installed. This is to minimize the CRM system's exposure to denial-of-service attacks.
Let us take an example of two server nodes (CRM001 and CRM002), where Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 Full Server is conigured (or will be installed) as a server cluster 
(CRMCluster) and the CRM installation uses a SQL Cluster environment (SQLCluster).
The following network diagram describes our multiserver deployment scenario:
Network Load Balancer
CRM001
CRMSQLCluster
CRM002
We have to perform the following steps to make this setup work:
 
f
Installing Dynamics CRM 2011 on both the server nodes (CRM001 and CRM002)
 
f
Creating a server cluster (CRMCluster)

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
56
 
f
Coniguring the SPN for the CRM Application Pool service account 
(CRMServiceAccount)
 
f
Coniguring NLB
How to do it…
To achieve multi-server deployment in our scenario, we have to complete the  
following subtasks.
First, we have to install Dynamics CRM 2011 on two server nodes; we will achieve this one at 
a time. Here, we are assuming that the installation of a Full Server role will be performed for 
both these server machines. As stated in the earlier sections, installing Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM Workgroup Server 2011 on multiple servers is not supported.
To install Dynamics CRM 2011 on these two machines, perform the following steps on each of 
the machines independently:
1. Follow the steps outlined in the Installing Dynamics CRM 2011 Server recipe to 
install Dynamics CRM 2011 server.
2. On the Specify Deployment Options page, select the instance of SQL Server that 
will be used for the Microsoft Dynamics CRM databases (CRMSQL). Then, check the 
Create a new deployment option. Click on Next and continue the setup.
3. On the Specify Security Account page, select a domain user account 
(CRMServiceAccount) that has been created previously.
4. Click on Continue to inish the installation.
The next steps are to create a server cluster for servers CRM001 and CRM002 and to enable 
loading balancing between them. The recommended settings while creating the NLB are  
as follows:
 
f
Port Range: 0 to 65535 (the default range)
 
f
Protocols: Both
 
f
Afinity: Single
The next step is to conigure the SPN for the CRM Application Pool service account.
In this deployment, we are using a domain user account (CRMServiceAccount) to run 
the Dynamics CRM 2011 Application Pool. When IIS 7.0 (or higher) is used on a cluster 
environment, we need to set up SPN for the Application Pool account. Active Directory uses 
the SPN for mutual authentication of a service instance, which enables the service instance 
to correctly authenticate a user who attempts to access resources that are located on other 
domain-member computers.

Chapter 1
57
Perform the following steps to conigure the SPN for the CRM Application Pool Account:
1. Log in to the Active Directory server machines with domain admin credentials.
2. Launch the ADSI Edit console from All Programs | Administrative Tools | ADSI Edit.
3. Expand the domain and the node that starts with DC= and then expand CN=Users.
4. Right-click on CRMServiceAccount and click on Properties.
5. From the attribute list, select servicePrincipalName and then click on Edit.
6. In the Value to add textbox, enter HTTP/CRMNLBName.FQDN and then click on Add.
Here, CRMNLBName is the CRM Server's cluster name (in this case, CRMCluster) 
and FQDN is the Fully Qualiied Domain Name of the cluster, for example, 
CRMCluster.MyOrg.com.
7. 
In the Value to add box, enter HTTP/CRMNLBName and then click on Add.
8. Click on OK the next two times.
9. Close the ADSI Edit window.
Now it is time to conigure the NLB for this deployment. NLB will be conigured using Dynamics 
CRM 2011 Deployment Manager. Perform the following steps to conigure the NLB:
1. Launch the deployment manager. This is usually accessible via the following path:
Start | All Programs | Microsoft Dynamics CRM | Deployment Manager
2. Right-click on Microsoft Dynamics CRM, and then click on Properties as shown in 
the following screenshot:
www.allitebooks.com

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
58
3. Click on the Web Address tab and verify that the cluster name (in this example, 
CRMCluster) appears, and then click on Advanced:
4. Select The deployment uses an NLB. Click on OK and then close the  
deployment manager:

Chapter 1
59
How it works…
Multiserver deployment gives performance beneits and scaling advantages. However, with 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Workgroup Server 2011, the Dynamics CRM 2011 server roles 
cannot be installed on separate computers. Load balanced multiserver deployment, as stated 
in the recipe, is essentially the most likely deployment paradigm in a production environment.
There's more…
It is common practice to deploy Dynamics CRM 2011 with a SQL Server clustered 
environment. To achieve this, create a SQL Server cluster, and then during Dynamics CRM 
2011 installation, on the Select SQL Server page, type the virtual server name that was 
speciied when we created the SQL Server cluster.
The multiserver deployment of Dynamics CRM 2011 can be more complex than what has 
been discussed in this recipe. One example of a complex deployment can be to deploy all 
server roles to separate server machines.
The following diagram describes a multiserver CRM 2011 deployment with different server 
roles deployed on separate server machines.

When we select a server role other than Full Server, Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server setup 
does not create an organization database during the installation. If the deployment does 
not have an organization database, we must use the deployment manager to create a new 
organization. The next recipe will guide us with creating a new organization in Dynamics  
CRM 2011.
Creating a new organization
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Deployment Manager is a wizard-based application that 
takes us through all the steps for creating a new organization. For multiserver deployment 
and while creating a multitenant CRM deployment, multiple organizations can be created for a 
Dynamics CRM 2011 CRM deployment.
How to do it…
The steps to create a new organization are as follows:
1. Launch the deployment manager. This is usually accessible via at:
Start | All Programs | Microsoft Dynamics CRM | Deployment Manager
2. Click on the Organizations link. This will list all the existing organizations deployed in 
this CRM environment as shown in the following screenshot:
3. Then, right-click on Organizations and select New Organization. The New 
Organization Wizard window will appear.
4. On the Specify the Organization Settings page, enter the following information:
 

Display Name: This will contain the name of the CRM Organization.
 

Unique Database Name: This will contain the database name for this CRM 
Organization.
 

ISO Currency Code: Click on Browse and select a base currency. Setting 
currencies has been discussed in the There's more… section of the Installing 
Dynamics CRM Server recipe.

Chapter 1


SQL Collation: In the SQL collation list, keep the default selection or select 
a different database collation that the organization database will use to sort 
and compare data characters.
5. Click on Next> to proceed:
6. On the Help Us Improve the Customer Experience page, select whether to 
participate in the Customer Experience Improvement Program, and then  
click on Next.
7. 
On the Select SQL Server page, specify the SQL Server machine name.
If we are using the default instance of SQL Server, we need to provide the machine 
name of the SQL Server, and in case we are using the named instance of SQL Server, 
we need to enter <machine-name>\<instance-name>.
8. On the Specify Reporting Services Server page, specify the Reporting 
Server URL value.
9. Next appears the System Checks page, which outlines a summary of all 
requirements and recommendations for a successful installation. If all the previous 
steps have been followed, everything should be OK. Make sure no errors are 
reported. If there are errors, they need to be corrected before we can continue.  
Click on Next.
10. Then appears the Ready to Create page. Here, review the selections and click on 
Create to create the new organization.

Installing Dynamics CRM 2011
62
How it works…
Using this recipe, organizations within Dynamics CRM 2011 can be set up. Multiple 
organizations can be set up by repeating this recipe. An organization within Dynamics CRM 
2011 is usually provided a meaningful name from the business standpoint. The organization 
name appears as part of the Dynamics CRM URL. However, there are some restricted names 
that cannot be used as organization names within Dynamics CRM.
These restricted names can be found in the ReservedName column of the 
ReservedNames table in the MSCRM_CONFIG database.
Editing the organization's details
A organization once set up can be renamed/modiied after creation. This is a fairly easy task 
and can be achieved using the deployment manager. The following details of an organization 
can be edited:
 
f
Display name of the organization
 
f
SQL Server
 
f
SSRS Server
How to do it….
Please perform the following steps to edit an organization's details:
1. Launch the deployment manager. This is usually accessible via:
Start Menu | All Programs | Microsoft Dynamics CRM | Deployment Manager
2. Navigate to Microsoft Dynamics CRM | Organizations, and then right-click 
on the organization and select Disable.
3. Click on the organization name and click on Edit Organization from the Actions pane 
as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
63
4. On the Edit Organization wizard screen, change the required properties and click on 
Next to proceed.
5. On the System Checks page, click on Next.
6. On the Ready to Apply Changes page, click on Apply.
7. 
Finally, click on Finish to complete the changes.
How it works…
Once the changes are applied, the organization is updated with the new changes. Unless 
setup encounters any error, the changes will be published and the changes will be visible in 
the organization list.

Introduction
Post the installation of Dynamics CRM 2011 Server, its maintenance, backup, and inally 
optimization need to be taken care of. The maintenance of Dynamics CRM 2011 requires 
familiarity with a wide range of servers, networks, mail systems, and so on.
After installation, the best practice is to back up some of the components. The backup  
would help to restore the server in the case of a failure of one or more components.  
A comprehensive backup and recovery mechanism should be in place before the  
Dynamics CRM 2011 solution is rolled out to end users for use.
The following components of the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server infrastructure need to be 
backed up (as recommended):
 
f
Database: The coniguration database (MSCRM_CONFIG) and the organization 
databases (OrganizationName_MSCRM) should have full database backups and 
transaction log backups.
It is also recommended to back up the other databases, such as master, msdb, 
ReportServer, and ReportServertempdb.
 
f
Dynamics CRM 2011 Server: The web.config ile should be backed up in case it is 
modiied post installation. The Windows registry subkeys in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSCRM have to be backed up.
 
f
Exchange Server: Backup for Exchange Server is not required from a Dynamics CRM 
2011 recovery standpoint. But the Exchange Server backup policy should be in place, 
in line with the recommended Exchange Server maintenance practices.
 
f
Domain controller: A full system state backup of the domain controller should  
be taken.
Another part of maintenance activities is to enable tracing when the system encounters 
errors. Dynamics CRM 2011 provides tracing capabilities. Tracing, by default, is disabled when 
Dynamics CRM 2011 components are installed. In this chapter, we will learn recipes on how 
to enable them.
We will also delve into the recipes on how to recover from a failure when it occurs. Recovering 
from a failure is very important, and we will explore how Dynamics CRM 2011 Server and SQL 
Server for Dynamics CRM 2011 can be recovered from a failure.
The last phase would be to look into the recipes for optimizing Dynamics CRM 2011 Server's 
performance. Performance optimization is a standard, nonfunctional requirement in any 
Dynamics CRM 2011 implementation. Though performance optimization greatly depends on 
the production network and infrastructure, we would explore the standard Dynamics CRM 
2011 Server optimization methods.

Backing up Dynamics CRM 2011 Database 
Server
A database server backup plan is very important for ensuring the ability to recover in case of 
any disaster. The Dynamics CRM 2011 Database Server backup strategy will usually be of the 
following two types:
 
f
To back up the Windows Server machine, which is running the Dynamics CRM 2011 
Database server
 
f
To back up the Dynamics CRM 2011-related databases using Microsoft SQL Server's 
in-built backup and recovery feature
Moreover, some level of hardware fault tolerance has to be present for a database server.  
This can mean the usage of a RAID-5 disk array for the databases and a RAID-1 (mirror) for 
the transaction logs.
Windows Server backup can be used to create and manage automatic scheduled backups of 
the database server. More information about Windows Server backup and recovery can be 
found at the following link:
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-in/library/dd979562(v=ws.10).aspx
In this recipe, we will discuss backing up the database server using SQL Server's backup 
feature. The Dynamics CRM 2011 Database backup plan should include database 
maintenance and database backups.
Getting ready
Our database backup plan should include each of the Dynamics CRM 2011 databases to 
make sure of a proper recovery in case one or all databases fail. The backup of MSCRM_
CONFIG and OrganizationName_MSCRM databases should include a full database backup 
and some number of transaction log backups. For databases that are updated infrequently, 
such as the master and msdb databases, we can have the full database backed up.
One important aspect of the database backup strategy is the frequency of the backup, that 
is, how frequently a database should be backed up. The recommendation here is to make 
frequent backups, but you need to make sure that the backup process does not impact the 
availability of the system to the end users to a great extent.
Frequent, full database backups reduce the number of restores after 
any database failure.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
68
The other aspect of the database backup strategy depends on how much data loss is 
acceptable to business users in case of a database failure. For example, if a maximum of an 
hour's data loss is acceptable, transaction logs should be backed up every one hour and an 
entire database should be backed up every day to reduce the number of restores.
How to do it…
The following steps will help create a database maintenance plan for the Dynamics  
CRM 2011 databases:
1. Launch SQL Server Management Studio by navigating to Start | All Programs | 
Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 | SQL Server Management Studio.
If the database is running the SQL Server 2012 version, the 
navigation path will be Start | All Programs | Microsoft SQL 
Server 2012 | SQL Server Management Studio.
SQL Server Management Studio can be installed on a machine that is not running 
the Dynamics CRM 2011 SQL Server databases.
Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 Database Server with a user having a sysadmin 
role. Then expand the Management node in Object Explorer.
A user having the sysadmin role can only create or manage 
maintenance plans. Object Explorer only displays the 
Maintenance Plans node for users who are members of the 
sysadmin fixed server role.
2. Under the Management node, right-click on Maintenance Plans and select 
Maintenance Plan Wizard as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
69
3. On the SQL Server Maintenance Plan Wizard page, click on Next to continue.
4. On the Select Plan Properties page, provide the Name and Description values for 
the maintenance plan.
Then select one of the following schedules:
 

Separate schedules for each task: This will create a separate schedule for 
each task added to the maintenance plan.
 

Single schedule for the entire plan or no schedule: This will create one 
schedule that applies to all tasks added to the maintenance plan.
In this recipe, select the Single schedule for the entire plan or no schedule option 
as we intend to create only one schedule for our entire maintenance plan. Then click 
on Next to proceed.
If the database is SQL Server 2012, then under Run as select the account that 
Microsoft SQL Server Agent uses when executing the maintenance plan.
5. On the Select Maintenance Tasks page, select one or more maintenance plan tasks. 
Here the recommendation is to select the following maintenance tasks:
 

Check Database Integrity: This maintenance task, by executing the DBCC 
CHECKDB T-SQL statement, would check the allocation and structural 
integrity of user and system tables and indexes to ensure that any integrity 
problems with the database are reported.
 

Back Up Database (Full): This maintenance task, by executing the BACKUP 
DATABASE T-SQL statement, would back up the whole database.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
70
 

Back Up Database (Transaction Log): This maintenance task, by executing 
the BACKUP LOG T-SQL statement, would back up the transaction logs of  
the database.
Then click on Next to proceed.
6. On the Select Maintenance Task Order page, select the following order (usually the 
proposed order):
1. Check Database Integrity
2. Back Up Database (Full)
3. Back Up Database (Transaction Log)
Then click on Next to proceed.
7. 
Then the Deine Database Check Integrity Task page is shown, and on this 
page we need to deine the databases that the Check Database Integrity task 
has to be associated with. Click on the Databases drop-down list and select the 
These databases option. Thereafter, select the following databases by ticking the 
checkboxes associated with each of them:
 

master
 

msdb
 

MSCRM_CONFIG
 

<OrganizationName>_MSCRM
There can be more than one organization database, 
so select all of them.
 


Here select the Create a backup ile for every database option, and then we can 
also modify the following options:
 

Backup files location: We can choose a file location (different from the 
default one) to store the backup files using a file browser associated with it 
and can define the backup file extension as well
 

Backup file extension: The default extension is .bak
 

Verify backup integrity: Check this option to verify that the backup set is 
complete and that all volumes are readable
 

Set backup compression: Select from the list whether we want to compress 
the database backup or not
By default, compression significantly increases CPU usage and 
the additional CPU consumed by the compression process might 
adversely affect concurrent operations.
Then, click on OK to conirm the selection and inally click on Next to proceed.
9. Next, we will see the Deine Back Up Database (Transaction Log) Task page, and  
on this page you need to deine the databases the transaction log backup task will  
be associated with.
Click on the Databases drop-down list and select the These databases option.  
Here, do not select databases, such as master and msdb, as these databases  
are updated infrequently.
Apply the same choices deined in the previous step for backup location, backup ile 
extension, and backup ile compression choices.
After making the selections, click on OK to conirm and then click on Next to proceed.
10. Next, we will see the Select Report Options page. Here a ile location other than 
the default one can be provided in the Folder location: ield of the Write a report 
to a text ile option. This location is used to save a report of the maintenance plan 
actions, and this report can be e-mailed by selecting the Email report option and 
providing an e-mail address under the To option.

73
11. Next, we will see the Complete the Wizard page; click on Finish to complete the 
maintenance plan.
12. On the Maintenance Wizard Progress page, monitor the status information of the 
actions of the Maintenance Plan Wizard, and once all the task statuses end on 
Success, click on Close to close the wizard.
After creating the maintenance task, we will now schedule it to run automatically at a 
scheduled time by performing the following steps:
1. In Object Explorer, expand the SQL Server Agent node and then expand the Jobs 
node under it.
2. Select the job that has the name in the <MaintenancePlan_Name>.Subplan_1 
format. Then right-click on this task and select Rename. Modify the Job Name ield to 
a better, self-explanatory name.
3. Again, right-click on the job name and select Properties from the context menu.
4. This will launch the Job Properties page. Then, click on the Schedules page under 
the Select a page list.
5. Click on New from the task pane at the bottom. This will open the New Job Schedule 
window. Provide the following details, such as the name, schedule type, frequency, daily 
frequency, and duration in their respective ields. Then click on OK to save the details:
6. Again, click on OK to save the scheduled job.

How it works…
The maintenance plan created in this recipe includes checking database integrity and taking 
the full and transactional backups of Dynamics CRM 2011 databases. Once the maintenance 
plan is created, it can be executed manually as well by right-clicking on the maintenance plan 
and then selecting Execute. The maintenance plan created can also be modiied in the future. 
This can be done by right-clicking on the maintenance plan name and then selecting Modify.
Backing up Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
Backing up Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server would include backing up its databases, 
program iles, and website iles. Now the database backup has already been discussed in the 
previous recipe. In this recipe, we will explore backing up program iles and website iles.
In addition to these iles, if any update rollups have been applied, the versions of these update 
rollups have to also be noted so that in case of failure recovery, these update rollups can also 
be reapplied.
The registry should also be backed up so that it can be restored in the case of a failure.
How to do it…
The following steps would create a backup of the iles:
1. Dynamics CRM 2011 Server program iles and websites reside in the following 
mentioned location by default. Please save the iles in a safe location on a separate 
backup machine.
These ile backups can be used in the case of any failure. Hence, it is recommended 
to save them on a separate machine itself.
By default, all Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server program iles are located in the 
folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft CRM\.
By default, the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server website iles are located in the 
folder C:\Program Files\Microsoft CRM\CRMWeb.
2. The registry under HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSCRM should also be backed up.
3. It is also very important to keep the update rollup information safe. The build  
number of the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server can potentially indicate what is the  
latest update rollup that has to be installed. The build number can be found by 
following these steps:
1. Browse to the Dynamics CRM 2011 URL in the Internet Explorer window.
2. Then go to File | Help | About Microsoft Dynamics CRM.

Chapter 2
75
3. This will show the build number of the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server as  
shown below.
How it works…
In this recipe, we have taken backup copies of the web.config and registry iles. 
The backups become very important in case changes have been made to them post 
the installation of Dynamics CRM 2011. In any case, keeping a backup copy is always 
recommended. This backup copy can be restored when a failure occurs.
The build number of the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server will conirm that the latest update 
rollup was installed on the environment. The RTM version of Dynamics CRM 2011 has a 
build number of 5.0.9688.583, and then with every update rollup release the build number 
changes. The following table shows the build numbers of the update rollups available till this 
book was written:

Recovering from a Dynamics CRM 2011 
Database Server failure
In the case of a Dynamics CRM 2011 Database Server failure, the database must be restored 
from the backup and reassociated with Dynamics CRM 2011.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
76
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to recover from a SQL Server failure:
1. In the case of a Full Server machine crash or failure, we might need to reinstall the 
operating environment of the server machine. Hence, we have to install the Windows 
Server version and make sure that the machine is joined to the same domain where 
Microsoft CRM Server is joined. Thereafter, we have to install the SQL Server version.
We have to use the same database name and disk structure. 
If we changed the database name, additional steps would be 
needed to associate it back with Dynamics CRM 2011 Server.
2. Log in to SQL Server Management Studio using Windows Authentication with a user 
credential, having CREATE DATABASE permissions on the instance of the SQL Server.
3. On the recovery path, the irst step would be to recover the master database, 
provided we have a backup of this database. To recover any system database,  
the database has to be started in single user mode.
More information about starting a SQL Server instance in single user mode can be 
found at the following link:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-IN/library/ms188236.aspx
Then to restore the full backup of the master database, type the following  
T-SQL statement:
RESTORE DATABASE master FROM <backup_device> WITH REPLACE
Replace <backup_device> with the ile location in a backup device, for example, 
T:\MS_CRM_Master_DB_Backup\master.bak.
If changes are made after the database has been backed up, 
these changes will be lost once the backup is restored. After the 
master database is restored, the instance of SQL Server may stop 
automatically. Please restart the SQL Server instance if required.
4. Post the master database restoration, the msdb database has to be restored. Before 
restoring msdb, stop the SQL Server Agent instance. Then, use the following T-SQL 
command to restore the msdb database:
RESTORE DATABASE msdb FROM <backup_device> WITH REPLACE
Replace <backup_device> with the ile location in a backup device, for example, 
T:\MS_CRM_Master_DB_Backup\msdb.bak.

Chapter 2
77
It is necessary to restore msdb once the master database has 
been restored. The msdb database contains scheduling and 
other data used by the system. If msdb is not restored, and is 
not accessible, SQL Server Agent cannot access or initiate any 
previously scheduled tasks.
5. Next, restore the MSCRM_CONFIG database and then all the organization databases. 
Execute the following T-SQL command to restore these databases:
RESTORE DATABASE MSCRM_CONFIG FROM <backup_device> WITH REPLACE
RESTORE DATABASE <Organization_MSCRM> FROM <backup_device> WITH 
REPLACE
Replace <backup_device> with the ile location in a backup device, for example, 
T:\MS_CRM_Master_DB_Backup\MSCRM_CONFIG.bak.
6. In case SQL Server Reporting Services and Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Connector 
for Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services are also installed on the same machine, 
ReportingServer and ReportingServertempDB are also required to be 
restored using the RESTORE DATABASE command as shown in the following  
T-SQL commands:
RESTORE DATABASE ReportingServer FROM <backup_device> WITH REPLACE
RESTORE DATABASE ReportingServertempDB FROM <backup_device> WITH 
REPLACE
Replace <backup_device> with the ile location in a backup device, for example, 
T:\MS_CRM_Master_DB_Backup\ReportingServer.bak.
7. 
Finally, we need to run the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server setup as stated in 
the Installing Dynamics CRM Server recipe of Chapter 1, Installing Dynamics CRM 
2011. But in this case, in the Specify Deployment Options page, we have to select 
the Connect to existing databases option.
This step should only be tried in case the MSCRM_CONFIG 
database has been restored. If this database has not 
been restored (because it was not required), then we can 
reconnect to this database using the deployment manager. 
Please follow the Editing the organization's details recipe 
as stated in Chapter 1, Installing Dynamics CRM 2011, and 
change the SQL Server value.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server

How it works…
In this recipe, we have recovered all the databases required to make Dynamics CRM 2011 
function step by step. The discussed scenario was a case of a Full Server failure. In case of a 
partial failure, we might need to restore a speciic database. If the MSCRM_CONFIG database 
is not restored, it has only to be reconnected to Dynamics CRM 2011 Server as stated in  
step 7 of this recipe.
Recovering from a Dynamics CRM 2011 
Server failure
In this recipe, we will see how to recover from a Dynamics CRM 2011 Server failure.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to recover from a Dynamics CRM 2011 Server failure:
1. In the case of a Full Server machine crash or failure, we might need to reinstall the 
operating environment of the server machine. Install the Windows Server version on 
the server, and join the machine to the same active directory where SQL Server for 
Dynamics CRM 2011 is already linked.
2. Install Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server by following the Installing Dynamics 
CRM Server recipe from Chapter 1, Installing Dynamics CRM 2011. During the 
installation, select Connect to, and if necessary, upgrade an existing deployment 
from the Specify Deployment Options page.
3. Apply the appropriate update rollups if they were installed before failure.
4. Once the installation is complete, replace the ISV.config and web.config  
iles from their backups in case changes were made in these iles from their  
default settings.
5. Restore the registry keys from the backups in case changes were made in the registry 
from their default settings.
6. In case the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Connector for Microsoft SQL Server 
Reporting Services component was also installed in the machine that failed, this 
component will have to be reinstalled.
How it works…
This recipe completes the restoration of Dynamic CRM 2011 Server in the case of a complete 
server failure. In the case of only a Dynamics CRM 2011 website failure, we only need to 
restore ISV.Config and web.config other than restoring the registry keys and importing 
and publishing any custom solution component.

Chapter 2
79
In the case of a multiserver deployment, where different server roles are deployed separately, 
if any server machine encounters failure, upon recovery of that server we might need to repair 
Dynamics CRM 2011 on other servers as well.
Enabling server-level tracing
This recipe guides us through the tracing feature while providing the method to enable  
server-level tracing.
Getting ready
Tracing is a helpful feature for capturing valuable information while debugging or ixing any 
errors or warnings within the Dynamics CRM 2011 servers.
Tracing is not available for the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online version.
Enabling tracing, however, has performance implications. Because of its resource-intensive 
nature, tracing slows down the performance of the server. Another warning on tracing is that it 
might log sensitive information and should be handled very carefully.
Tracing is disabled by default and the standard recommendation is to 
keep it disabled unless some error or warning debugging activity has to 
be performed.
There are two methods of enabling tracing in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server. These 
are as follows:
 
f
Server-level tracing: By enabling server-level tracing, only the current server machine 
where tracing is enabled can be monitored. Server-level tracing does not require any 
speciic server role to be running in the computer, and it can provide a greater degree 
of control, where we can set speciic trace values such as which Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM 2011 features to trace or the maximum trace ile size.
Server-level tracing has to be manually set in the Windows registry on the computer 
where one or more Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 server roles are running.
 
f
Deployment-level tracing: By enabling deployment-level tracing, all the machines 
that are running various Dynamics CRM 2011 server roles and services would be 
monitored regardless of the server roles installed on the local computer where 
tracing is enabled.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
80
With deployment-level tracing enabled, all the server roles, such as Asynchronous 
Service, Sandbox Processing Service, Unzip Service, the web application (w3wp), and 
deployment tools (mmc-Tools), are monitored. Corresponding trace iles are created.
Deployment-level tracing is enabled using the Windows PowerShell command and is 
maintained in the MSCRM_CONFIG database.
Deployment-level tracing can only be enabled from a 
computer that has the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 
Deployment Tools server role.
If both deployment-level and server-level tracing are enabled 
on the same computer, only server-level tracing will be used.
To enable server-level tracing, certain registry changes have to be made on the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 server computer. Now the recommended practice is to back up the registry before 
any changes are performed. So before enabling tracing, back up the registry and save it in a 
safe location so that we can restore it if required.
How to do it…
To enable server-level tracing, perform the following steps:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server machine as a local machine administrator.
2. Launch the Registry Editor application by going to the Start menu and clicking on 
Run. Then, type regedit and click on OK.
3. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSCRM in the registry.
Create the following mandatory registry keys for enabling tracing.
4. Right-click and select New | DWORD (32-bit) Value.
5. Enter the key name as TraceEnabled and value as 1 as shown in the  
following screenshot:

Chapter 2
81
6. Right-click and select New | DWORD (32-bit) Value. Then enter the key name as 
TraceRefresh with a value between zero 0 and 99. Actually, the data value does not 
matter; the act of changing the value of this registry subkey will trigger a trace setting 
change in the system:
Now, there are a few optional registry keys that can be added.
7. 
Add a String or Multi-String value with the name TraceCategories and the 
value in the format Category.Feature:TraceLevel. You should know that 
TraceCategories is a combination of category, feature, and trace levels.
One of the examples of the value would be Application.*.Error; it is going 
to capture the error logs for all the application features. Another example could be 
Platform.Sql.Verbose that would capture verbose logs of interactions with  
SQL Server.
8. Add a DWORD with the name TraceCallStack and decimal value of either 0 or 1.
A value of 1 would mean the call stack would be included in the trace log and a value 
of 0 would mean the call stack would not be included.
9. Add a DWORD with the name TraceFileSizeLimit and decimal value between 1 
and 100. This value will specify the maximum size of the trace iles. New iles will be 
created in case the maximum size is reached.
How it works…
These registry keys have to be created with the values previously speciied. If the registry keys 
have been created with default values, tracing will not be enabled.
For the TraceEnabled mandatory registry key, a value of 0 means tracing is disabled and a 
value of 1 means it is enabled.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
82
If the optional registry keys have not been created, the default values for these keys will be 
used by tracing. The default values for the optional registry keys are:

Enabling deployment-level tracing
Deployment-level tracing would enable tracing for all the server roles. However, this tracing 
can only be conigured from a machine that has the Deployment Tool role installed.
Deployment-level tracing can only be conigured using Windows PowerShell commands.
How to do it…
By following this recipe, we can enable deployment-level tracing on the machine that is 
running the Deployment Tool server role.

Chapter 2
83
We need to perform the following steps to achieve this:
1. Log in to the machine as a local administrator and launch Windows PowerShell by 
clicking on Start | All Programs | Accessories | Windows PowerShell | Windows 
PowerShell.
2. In the PowerShell window, type the following command:
Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.Crm.PowerShell
3. To turn on the deployment-wide tracing, type the following commands:
$Setting = Get-CrmSetting TraceSettings
$Setting.Enabled = $True 
Set-CrmSetting $setting
4. To turn off the deployment-wide tracing, type the following commands:
$Setting = Get-CrmSetting TraceSettings
$Setting.Enabled = $False 
Set-CrmSetting $setting
5. To check the current status of the deployment-wide tracing, type the  
following command:
Get-CrmSetting TraceSettings
The trace files are located at C:\crmdrop\logs.
How it works…
Deployment-level tracing provides deployment-wide tracing information. This setting should be 
carefully enabled as this would log tracing from every server where the Dynamics CRM 2011 
server roles are running.
The deployment-level trace setting is stored in the MSCRM_CONFIG database. Use the 
following T-SQL command to ind the deployment tracing setting in the database:
SELECT [ColumnName],[IntColumn],[BitColumn],[NVarCharColumn]
FROM [MSCRM_CONFIG].[dbo].[DeploymentProperties]
WHERE ColumnName LIKE'Trace%'

Enabling tracing on the Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM 2011 E-mail Router machine
In this recipe, we will explore the steps to enable tracing for the Dynamics CRM 2011 E-mail 
router service.
How to do it…
Follow the next steps to enable tracing on the Dynamics CRM 2011 E-mail Router machine:
1. Log in to the server where Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 E-mail Router is installed 
with the local machine administrative permission.
2. Launch Registry Editor by going to the Start menu and clicking on Run. Then type 
regedit and click on OK.
3. Navigate to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\
Services\MSCRMEmail subkey in the registry.
4. Right-click on the subkey and select Modify. Change the decimal value to 3 from the 
default value of 1.
5. Thereafter, locate the Microsoft.Crm.Tools.EmailAgent.xml ile in the 
machine. By default, the ile is located at SystemDrive:\Program Files\
Microsoft CRM Email\Service.
6. Open the ile in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, change the <LogLevel> value 
from 1 to 3 shown as follows:
<LogLevel>3</LogLevel>
7. 
Save the ile.
8. And inally, restart E-mail Router.

How it works…
This recipe enables tracing for the E-mail Router machine. Tracing speciic to E-mail Router is 
enabled by modifying the registry entries speciic to E-mail Router in the machine where the 
E-mail Router component is installed.
Monitoring Dynamics CRM 2011 Server 
performance
Consistently monitoring a system's performance is very important to assess its health. 
Constant monitoring would assist to identify any potential issue in advance. Microsoft 
Windows comes with a performance-monitoring tool called Performance Monitor. This tool 
can be used to assess the performance of Dynamics CRM 2011 Server components.
There are many performance objects built into the operating system to monitor systems' 
performance. Dynamics CRM 2011 also adds to these performance objects to better 
monitor Dynamics CRM 2011 Server components. Dynamics CRM 2011 provides additional 
performance counters that are to be added. We can conigure Windows Performance Monitor 
to obtain and display performance data as system components run on a Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM 2011 Deployment.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to add Dynamics CRM 2011 performance counters:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server machine(s) with local  
administrative privileges.
2. Launch the Performance Monitor tool by going to the Start menu and clicking on 
Run, and then type perfmon.msc in the box and press Enter.
3. Select Performance Monitor under Monitoring Tools as shown in the  
following screenshot:

4. Then, click on the add (plus sign) toolbar icon in the right pane to open the Add 
Counters dialog box:
5. From the list of available counters, select the counters speciic to Dynamics CRM 
2011 and then click on the Add button below as shown in the following screenshot:
6. Finally, click on OK. The selected counters are added to the list of active counters and 
the data that they generate is shown in the dynamic graph.

Chapter 2
87
How it works…
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 offers the following performance counters that we need  
to monitor:
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Client counters

Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server counters
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Authentication counters
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Outlook Sync counters
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Discovery counters

f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Service counters
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Sandbox Client counters
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Sandbox Host counters
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Async Service counters

Microsoft Dynamics CRM E-mail Router counters
The necessary performance counters have to be chosen based on the server roles installed 
on the machine. More detailed information about these performance counters can be 
downloaded from the following Microsoft website link:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27119
Usually, the performance counters are used only for a speciied time to check or diagnose 
any performance issues. Therefore, adding them to the base Performance Monitors is easy 
and serves the purpose too. In this recipe, the performance counters are directly added to 
the existing set. Alternatively, a separate data collector set can also be created and then the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 performance counter can be added to the set. More information on 
creating a data collector set can be found at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/
library/cc722414.aspx.
Optimizing Dynamics CRM 2011 Database 
Server performance
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 is a resource-intensive, web-based application. Certain 
parameters of the system have to be tuned for optimum performance. Dynamics CRM 2011 
Server performance tuning can happen mainly in two components: the Dynamics CRM 2011 
Database level and the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server component level. In this recipe, we will 
delve into how the Dynamics CRM 2011 database can be tuned for better performance.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
88
Getting ready
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 uses SQL Server. For better performance tuning on SQL 
Server, we need to identify the performance bottlenecks in the database server. SQL 
Server performance monitoring tools such as Activity Monitor (part of SQL Server 2008 
Management Studio) should be used to check the performance of SQL Server.
Accurate performance tuning steps should be taken by analyzing the performance 
bottlenecks. Here we will explore a few common performance-tuning techniques for  
the Dynamics CRM 2011 database.
Before applying these performance optimization techniques in a live 
environment, they should irst be veriied in a test environment that 
approximately matches the complexity, data volume, and integration 
points of the production environment.
How to do it…
The following points explain how to performance tune your Dynamics CRM 2011 database:
1. Store datailes and logiles on separate physical disks: Keeping both data and 
log iles on the same drive can cause contention for that device and result in poor 
performance. Storing the iles on separate drives allows I/O activity to occur at the 
same time for both the data and log iles. This is a very important consideration for 
organization databases as the data growth is very frequent and usually very high too.
During a database CREATE operation, specify separate physical drive locations for 
the data and log iles. In case the database has already been created, move the iles 
by performing the following steps:
1. Take a backup of the database and then take the database offline: The 
database can be backed up by right-clicking on the database name in the 
Object Explorer pane within SQL Server Management Studio and then 
selecting Tasks | Back Up… as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
89
2. This will open a Back Up Database screen; enter a value for Backup type 
and the location information, and click on OK to back up. Wait until a backup 
successful message appears.
3. Thereafter, to take the database offline, right-click on the database  
name inside SQL Server Management Studio and then select  
Tasks | Take Offline.
2. Restore the database from the backup: Right-click on the Databases node inside 
SQL Server Management Studio and then select the Restore Database… option as 
shown in the following screenshot:
This will launch the Restore Database page. Here select the Device option under the 
Source details in the Generals node and then click on the associated File Explorer 
beside it. This will launch the Select Backup Devices page. Choose Backup media 
type as File and click on the Add button to select the database backup ile(s). Then, 
click on OK to save the selections.
The next step would be to specify separate locations for data and log iles. Click on 
the Files node on the Restore Database page. In this page, check the Relocate all 
iles to folder option and then use the folder browser to change the Data ile folder 
and Log ile folder values. Finally, click on OK to start the database restore operation 
and wait until it is successful.
Finally, restart the SQL Server instance.
3. Set the right database ile size for the organization databases: Organization 
databases contain data that changes more frequently, and the arrival of new data 
is also more frequent. If the database ile size is small, it will attract incremental 
growth of the ile. There is a little overhead in frequent increments in the database 
ile. Hence, it is recommended to specify a reasonable amount considering the data 
growth for the next three to six months.
To change the initial database ile size using SQL Server Management Studio, please 
follow these steps:
1. Right-click on the organization database and then select Properties | Files.
2. On the Files page, modify the Initial Size column values (as shown in the 
following screenshot).

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
90
3. Restart the SQL Server service:
4. Set the Autogrowth size of the organization databases (OrganizationName_
MSCRM) considering the growth of the database for a period of three to six months: 
If the autogrowth size is not managed properly, the database might experience many 
autogrow events, or very few. Every time an autogrowth event is ired, SQL Server 
holds up the database processing until the autogrowth event is complete. This 
equates to a slower response time for those SQL commands that are being  
processed against the database that is growing.
The autogrowth size of a database can be modiied by right-clicking on the database 
name, then going to Properties | Files. Then, click on the button associated under 
the Autogrowth column; then in the pop-up window, autogrowth-related settings can 
be modiied.

Chapter 2
91
5. Increase the Initial Size value and the Autogrowth size of the tempdb database: 
This database is used by SQL Server, and it increments as its usage increases. 
By default, the initial size of tempdb is 8 MB; this means that every time tempdb 
crosses the 8 MB size, an autogrowth event would ire. In addition to this, every time 
a SQL Server service is restarted, tempdb would be set back to its initial size, which 
is 8 MB, by default. Frequent tempdb ile size growth slows down the performance of 
SQL Server. Hence, its initial size has to be increased to a larger value.
The FileGrowth property of tempdb has to be adjusted 
based on the speed of the I/O subsystem on which the tempdb 
files are located. It is recommended that we put the tempdb 
database on a fast I/O subsystem and on disks that differ from 
those that are used by Dynamics CRM 2011 databases.
The best way to estimate the size and the reasonable FileGrowth size of tempdb  
is to run the workload in a test environment. Once we have a good estimate of the 
size of tempdb, set its size with a safety factor that is appropriate. Autogrow should 
be used as a last resort but not as a strategy. Moreover, to avoid any potential  
latch timeouts, it is usually recommended to limit the autogrow operation to 
approximately 2 minutes.
Another general guideline about tempdb is to create one data ile for each CPU or 
core on the server (accounting for any afinity mask settings) and then adjust the 
number of iles up or down as appropriate.
Using multiple iles reduces the tempdb storage contention and yields signiicantly 
better scalability. Make each data ile the same size; this allows for optimal 
proportional-ill performance.
To change the tempdb database ile sizes using SQL Server Management Studio, 
please follow these steps:
1. Right-click on the tempdb database and then go to Properties | Files.
2. On the Files page, modify the Initial Size and Autogrowth size field to an 
appropriate size.
3. Click on the Add button to add additional data files to the tempdb database. 
When additional data files are added, we should specify the following 
properties of the data file:
 

Logical Name
 

Initial Size
 

Autogrowth size
 

Path
 

File Name
4. Then restart the SQL Server service.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server

We will also see how to allocate suficient memory to SQL Server. By default, SQL 
Server can change its memory requirements dynamically based on the maximum 
resources available. The default setting for maximum server memory in SQL Server 
2008 R2 or the 2012 edition is 2147483647 MB. Maximizing the allocation of 
maximum server memory might assist in getting a better performance. But if more 
memory is provided to SQL Server, the other applications will perform slowly on the 
same machine.
To change the maximum server memory size of SQL Server, follow these steps:
1. Inside SQL Server Management Studio, on the Object Explorer pane, right-
click on the server and select Properties.
2. Then, navigate to the Memory node and under Server memory  
options, enter the Maximum server memory value as shown in  
the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
93
More information on SQL Server memory coniguration options can be found at the 
following link:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178067.aspx
6. Create indexes for the Extension and custom entity tables: Dynamics CRM 2011 
creates the <EntityName>_Extension table for storing the custom attributes of 
a system entity, and custom entities are stored in custom tables in the organization 
databases. Monitor slow performing queries for these tables and then create a 
custom index for the Extension and custom entity tables. This would assist in 
improving performance.
If the Quick Find View and Lookup View features contain many custom ields, it can 
have an adverse impact on the performance of these lookup queries. Either use very 
limited custom ields in these views or create a non-clustered index that includes 
these custom ields.
The application of any update rollup might delete existing custom 
indexes on Dynamics CRM 2011 database tables.
Use the CREATE INDEX query to create indexes in the Dynamics CRM 2011 tables.
7. 
Set maximum degree of parallelism (MAXDOP) to 1: When SQL Server runs on 
a multicore machine, the number of processors that can be used to run a single 
statement for each parallel execution plan can be speciied. This is called maximum 
degree of parallelism. When the default value of MAXDOP is 0, it means that SQL 
Server determines the maximum degree of parallelism.
When we set the MAXDOP value to 1, the parallel plan generation will be suppressed. 
It is often observed that with the MAXDOP value of 1, SQL Server performs better.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server

The MAXDOP value can be set inside SQL Server Management Studio by following 
these steps:
1. Right-click on the server name and then go to Properties | Advanced.
2. In the advanced settings page, we can set the Max Degree of Parallelism 
field as shown in the following screenshot:
8. Modify certain deployment properties' parameters: Updating a few deployment 
properties in the Dynamics CRM 2011 database provides ixes around certain 
database-level issues and exceptions.
 

SQLCommandTimeout: It has been observed that a large size file import 
fails inside Dynamics CRM 2011 throwing SQL Server-level timeout errors. 
SQLCommandTimeout is a field with a default value of 30 that is present in 
the MSCRM_CONFIG database.

Chapter 2
95
Increase the value of the SQLCOmmandTimeout parameter to a larger value. 
Use the following SQL command to modify the value:
USE MSCRM_CONFIG
GO
UPDATE DeploymentProperties SET IntColumn=9000 WHERE 
ColumnName='SqlCommandTimeout'
 

AggregateQueryRecordLimit: This deployment setting controls the 
maximum number of records that are returned by aggregate queries  
(used in charts). Sometimes the default value of 50000 does not suffice  
and exceptions such as AggregateQueryRecordLimit exceeded  
are thrown.
Increase the value of the AggregateQueryRecordLimit parameter to a 
larger value. Use the following SQL command to modify the value:
USE MSCRM_CONFIG
GO
UPDATE DeploymentProperties SET IntColumn=100000 WHERE Colum
nName='AggregateQueryRecordLimit '
9. Control the growth of the PrincipleObjectAccess (POA) table: As almost every 
access to the Dynamics CRM 2011 data interacts with the POA table of the 
<OrganizationName>_MSCRM database, a large-size POA table would signiicantly 
slow down the SQL queries' performance. Until Update Rollup 6 for Dynamics 
CRM 2011, when a record was deleted from the Dynamics CRM 2011 system, 
corresponding POA entries were not getting deleted. This was causing a signiicant 
growth of the POA table and slowness in SQL query execution.
Update Rollup 6 applies control over the growth of the PrincipleObjectAccess (POA) 
table by deleting entries when a Dynamics CRM 2011 record gets deleted from the 
system. However after installing Update Rollup 6, there is a SQL query that is required 
to be executed on the Dynamics CRM 2011 database only once. The SQL query can 
be found at the following link:
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2664150
10. Control the growth of the AsyncOperationBase table: The AsyncOperationBase 
table of Dynamics CRM 2011's organization database grows to be very large in no 
time if the organization executes asynchronous operations such as worklows. Unless 
controlled, the growth of this table can affect performance adversely.
A regular cleanup of the AsyncOperationBase table is recommended, although it 
will delete all the entries for every job run in a period. If completed system job entries 
have some business value and have to be stored for a longer period, cleaning up this 
table regularly is not possible.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server

The SQL script to delete the AsyncOperationsBase table can be found at 
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968520.
 

Rescheduling Dynamics CRM 2011 maintenance jobs:
By default, Dynamics CRM 2011 creates and runs a few maintenance jobs 
on a daily basis. These jobs are actually executed by Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM Asynchronous Processing Service (maintenance). This service 
schedules these jobs based on when the organization has been created. 
Therefore, these jobs can very well run when there is a pick user load on the 
system and will not slow down the system's performance or cause timeouts. 
Hence, it is recommended to reschedule these jobs when we expect very 
little of the user in the system. In the How it works… section of this recipe,  
we shall discuss a little more about these jobs.
Dynamics CRM stores scheduling information about these jobs in the 
ScaleGroupOrganizationMaintenanceJobs table of the MSCRM_
CONFIG database. However, there is a GUI tool available to modify the 
settings of these jobs. The GUI tool is known as CRM 2011 Maintenance 
Job Editor and is available at the following link for download:
http://crmjobeditor.codeplex.com/
If you want to disable a job, please specify a future date (for example, 
12/31/3000) under Next Run Time for that job.

Chapter 2
97
How it works…
This recipe discusses the common performance tuning techniques performed on the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 database. These tuning techniques should be applied in conjunction 
with the speciic performance bottlenecks identiied in the Dynamics CRM 2011 environment.
In this recipe, we have irst tried to check the iring of the autogrowth event. Frequent 
autogrowth event ire would signiicantly impact performance. Indexing data, which does not 
use indexes, is important to improve the performance of SQL queries. MAXDOP should be  
set to 1 for performance improvement. Additionally, the best practices around temdb are  
also recommended.
Finally, control the growth of the PrincipleObjectAccess and AsyncOperationBase 
tables along with adjusting the timings for the Dynamics CRM 2011 maintenance tasks. A list 
of maintenance jobs run by Asynchronous Processing Service (maintenance) is as follows:
Maintenance job

Optimizing Dynamics CRM 2011 Server 
performance
In this recipe, we will try to igure out the different performance-boosting techniques we can 
adopt in the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server environment. Performance tuning is a continuous 
balancing act between design decision, available resources, hardware, cost, and so on. 
Additionally, identifying the performance issues in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system is also 
very important to conduct a tuning.

Chapter 2
99
How to do it…
The following steps explore a few high-level methods of performance tuning:
1. While considering multiserver deployment of Dynamics CRM 2011, separating 
the server roles and using network load balancers would signiicantly improve the 
performance of the system. In a multiserver deployment, consider deploying the 
following in dedicated servers:
 

The Dynamics CRM 2011 Front End Server role
 

The Dynamics CRM 2011 Back End Server role
 

The Dynamics CRM 2011 Deployment Server role
 

Dynamics CRM 2011 Database Server
 

Reporting Server for Dynamics CRM 2011
 

Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 E-mail Router or Microsoft Exchange Server
 

Active Directory Domain Controller
Another important consideration of deployment would be federated architecture. If 
Dynamics CRM 2011 is accessible from different geographies, you should deploy the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 infrastructure in a federated manner instead of deploying it in a 
centralized location. The deployment of the Dynamics CRM 2011 servers in the close 
proximity of the user's access location would assist in reducing the effect of network 
latency and travel time.
2. Using HTTP Compression in the IIS7 or any higher versions enables both static and 
dynamics compression of the Dynamics CRM 2011 web servers in the IIS.
Perform the following steps to conigure HTTP Compression in a web server:
1. In the Dynamics CRM 2011 web server, go to the Start menu and click 
on Run, and type inetmgr and press Enter. This will launch the Internet 
Information Services (IIS) Manager administrative interface.
2. Double-click on Compression on the Features View tab of the interface.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
100
3. Click on the Enable dynamic content compression checkbox to enable 
dynamic compression.
4. Then, click on the Enable static content compression checkbox to enable 
static compression.
If static compression is enabled, in the Only compress files larger 
than (in bytes) textbox type the minimum file size that we want IIS  
to compress.
Browse to select a cache directory and leave the default value.
Click on the Per application pool disk space limit (in MB) checkbox 
and type the maximum amount of space per application pool that IIS 
uses when it compresses static content.
Click on the Apply button on the Actions pane to apply these changes.
3. This step will help you change the MaxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU setting. By 
default, IIS7.5 (with .NET Framework 4.0) is limited to handling 5000 concurrent 
requests per CPU and will queue requests above this limit. 5000 is also the value  
we should use in ASP.NET Versions 2.0 and 3.5, which have a default of 12.  
Although most web applications usually work ine with the value of 5000, to  
achieve a better concurrency this value can be altered. This parameter should  
irst be altered and tested for performance in a test environment before moving  
on to a production system.

Chapter 2
101
Perform the following steps to modify the MaxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU setting 
in IIS7.5:
1. Log in to Windows Server where Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 is installed 
with local machine administrative permission.
2. Launch Registry Editor by going to the Start menu and clicking on Run. Then 
type regedit and click on OK.
3. Navigate to the following location and check whether a DWORD by the name 
of MaxConcurrentReqeustsPerCPU exists or not.
 

For ASP.NET 4.0:
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ 
 
ASP.NET\4.0.30319.0
 

For ASP.NET 2.0:
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ 
 
ASP.NET\2.0.50727.0
If the DWORD does not exist, create a new DWORD with the name 
MaxConcurrentReqeustsPerCPU and specify the value as a  
higher number.
If the DWORD already exists, modify the value to a higher number.  
This is shown in the following screenshot:
4. Output caching will cache a frequently used object into memory so that it can be 
delivered quickly on subsequent requests. Add output caching around images iles 
and script iles. Perform the following steps to conigure output caching:
1. In the Dynamics CRM 2011 web server, go to the Start menu and click 
on Run. Type inetmgr and press Enter. This will launch the Internet 
Information Services (IIS) Manager administrative interface.
2. Double-click on Output Caching on Features View of IIS.
3. Then, click on Add in the Actions pane. The Edit Cache Rule page will  
be launched.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
102
4. Provide the output caching rule definition by providing the File name 
extension value, for example, .js.
5. Select the User-mode caching option.
6. In the File Cache Monitoring section, select the At time intervals 
(hh:mm:ss) option and provide a time interval.
7. 
Finally, click on the OK button to add the output caching rule as shown in the 
following screenshot:
5. Set the Dynamics CRM 2011 Application Pool Recycling interval to an hour or so. 
Follow the ensuing steps to achieve this:
1. Launch the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager interface as a local 
system administrator.
2. Click on the Application Pools node in the Object Explorer pane.
3. Then, right-click on the CRMAppPool node and select Recycling….
4. The Edit Application Pool Recycling Settings page will appear. Set the 
Regular time intervals (in minutes) settings to an appropriate time interval, 
say 60 minutes, and click on Next to proceed.
5. Click on Finish to save the setting.

Chapter 2
103
6. To change the timeout values, that is, to add/modify the OLEDBTimeout and 
ExtendedTimeout registry settings in the web server, follow the ensuing steps:
1. Go to the Start menu and click on Run, and then type regedit and  
press Enter.
2. Navigate to HKEY_LCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MSCRM in  
the registry.
3. Add a DWORD with the name OLEDBTimeout and a value of 86400, if not 
already present.
4. Add another DWORD with the name ExtendedTimeout and a value of 
1000000, if not already present.
Note that configuring these settings via the web server 
registry will apply the configuration to all organizations 
that use the web servers.
7. 
Coniguring the EnableRetrieveMultipleOptimization (ERMO) setting to the default 
value of 0 should take place when Update Rollup 10 or higher is installed. Otherwise, 
Dynamics CRM 2011 will not be able to automatically optimize the performance 
of the queries against large data sets. With Update Rollup 10, two new statistical 
settings have been introduced to optimize the RetrieveMultiple queries. These 
statistical settings are as follows:
 

RecordCountLimitToSwitchToCteSecuritySql (default value 
of 75000): This specifies the number of records below which Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 will default to a query based on the OR operator using 
joins. We will try to keep this value as high as possible because a lower value 
will have an impact on SQL Server memory use.
 

RetrieveMultipleSharingCountThreshold (default value of 1000): 
This specifies the number of shared records that are associated with a user 
directly or with the teams to which the user belongs. We should consider 
increasing its value in case a user with an above average number of shared 
records for any entity is experiencing slow performance with that entity. It is 
recommended to increase its value in small (100 or 200) increments.
The value of these two parameters can be modiied using the OrgDBOrgSettings 
tool offered by Microsoft. This tool can be downloaded from http://support.
microsoft.com/kb/2691237. There are many more settings that can be modiied 
using this tool. The lists of these settings can be found at the aforementioned link. 
However, it is advisable to measure the performance beneit as a result of any such 
modiication in a test environment before its application to any live system.

Maintaining and Optimizing Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Server
104
If these settings do not provide the desired performance, we can consider adjusting 
the value for the EnableRetrieveMultipleOptimization setting. This speciic 
setting can also be conigured with Dynamics CRM 2011 using Update Rollup 2 or 
higher. Please perform the following steps to conigure this setting in the web server:
1. Go to the Start menu and click on Run, and then type regedit and  
press Enter.
2. Navigate to HKEY_LCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MSCRM in  
the registry.
3. Add a DWORD with the name EnableRetrieveMultipleOptimization 
and a value of 2, if not already present.
Adding a preferred domain controller setting in the Dynamics CRM 2011 
application server will speed up the Active Directory checks. Please follow 
the ensuing steps to conigure this setting in the web server:
Go to the Start menu and click on Run, and then type regedit and 
press Enter.
Navigate to HKEY_LCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MSCRM 
in the registry.
Add a string value with the name PreferredDC and the value <DC_
Name>, if not already present.
How it works…
In this recipe, we have discussed scaling the deployment to improve performance. Thereafter, 
we have applied IIS-level optimizations offered by IIS7 or higher versions. Though Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 is conigured to compress web responses that are sent to browser 
clients by default, HTTP response compression is an IIS-level setting and has to be enabled 
from IIS. But, compression setting is an IIS-wide setting and cannot be enabled/disabled only 
for speciic websites.
The Dynamics CRM 2011 level settings changes are done to optimize the performance of 
queries involving large data sets, and the timeout setting is conigured so that such queries  
do not throw timeout errors.

Administering Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011
After successful installation of Dynamics CRM 2011 Server, we looked at recipes in the 
previous chapter for backing up and restoring Dynamics CRM 2011 Server components. In 
this chapter, we will delve into recipes for coniguring the Dynamics CRM 2011 system to 
make it ready for customization work. As part of administration, we will ind out how Dynamics 
CRM 2011 deployment can be secured with SSL and then how to conigure AD FS-based 
authentication, and inally how to deploy Internet-facing Dynamics CRM 2011. In addition,  
we will delve into recipes for coniguring system-wide settings. These recipes will have  
system-wide impact; hence, before implementing any of these recipes, careful thought  
should be put into assessing the impact on Dynamics CRM 2011 Server.

Securing Dynamics CRM 2011 deployment 
with SSL/HTTPS
Coniguring systems for SSL/HTTPS is a more secure way to transfer data. But the activity 
of coniguring Dynamics CRM 2011 for HTTPS causes disruption in CRM usage. Hence this 
activity should be carried out at a time at which it will cause minimal possible disruptions  
to users.
How to do it…
We can secure Dynamics CRM 2011 by following these steps:
1. Log in to the machine where Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Deployment Manager 
is running. Launch the Deployment Manager console by navigating to Start | All 
Programs | Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011.
2. Disable the servers where frontend server roles (the web application server, 
organization web service, discovery web service, and deployment web service roles) 
are running by right-clicking on each frontend server and selecting Disable.
3. The next step will be to conigure the Dynamics CRM 2011 website to use HTTPS.  
To start with, we must obtain an appropriate certiicate. After the certiicate has 
been obtained, install the certiicate on the same server to complete the certiicate 
request process. The certiicate is now complete and ready for use. Now, secure it 
with a password.

Chapter 3
109
Certificates can be obtained at IIS level. Internet server certificates 
are issued by public certification authorities (CAs). The following 
link describes how to request an IIS certificate:
 http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/
cc732906(v=ws.10).aspx
4. Once the certiicate is obtained, conigure the server(s) to use HTTPS where the Web 
Application Server role is installed.
5. Log in to the machine where the Application Server role is installed and launch 
the Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager console. Then, right-click on the 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM website and select Edit Bindings. Finally, click on the  
Add… button.
6. The Add Site Binding page will appear. Here, we need to specify the values for the 
Type, IP address, and Port ields and pick the value for SSL certiicate.
In case of a multi-server deployment, repeat this step in every 
frontend server where Web Application Server role is deployed.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011

7. 
Restart the IIS for all of the preceding servers.
8. Launch Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Deployment Manager and click on the 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM node in the Object Explorer window. Then, in the Actions 
pane, click on Properties | Web Address tab. Under Binding Type, select HTTPS. 
Verify that the web addresses are valid for the SSL certiicate and the SSL port bound 
to the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Server 2011 website. Finally, click on the OK button 
to apply the changes.
9. Then enable the frontend servers disabled earlier using Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
2011 Deployment Manager.
How it works…
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) provides secure data transfer across the wire. By following this 
recipe, we will be able to enable HTTPS on our Dynamics CRM website and hence can ensure 
secure data transfer.

Coniguring Claims-based authentication  
(AD FS) for Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) provides web-based single sign-on to 
authenticate a user to use multiple web applications during the lifetime of a single online 
session. AD FS achieves this by securely sharing the digital identity and entitlement rights,  
or "claims" across security and enterprise boundaries.
AD FS can help in authenticating Dynamics CRM 2011 users located in completely different 
networks or organizations. 
Getting ready
When we want to deploy Dynamics CRM 2011 using Internet-Facing Deployment, Dynamics 
CRM 2011 has to be conigured to use a Secure Token Service (STS) such as AD FS. Both 
CRM and AD FS have to be secured with SSL, that is, users will connect to them using HTTPS.
There are usually two ways to deploy a CRM and AD FS solution:
 
f
Installing CRM (frontend roles) and AD FS on the same server: It is preferable to 
run the AD FS service on the default website with default port bindings (port 80 and 
443). Hence, Dynamics CRM 2011 has to be conigured to use different ports (for 
example, port 5555 for HTTP and port 444 for HTTPS).
It is even possible to run both AD FS and CRM on the same port, 443, using different 
IP addresses. Usually, such a deployment strategy is avoided because of deployment 
issues encountered.
 
f
Install CRM (Frontend roles) and AD FS in separate servers: In this type of 
deployment, both CRM and AD FS can be deployed using HTTPS on port 443.  
But we have to make sure both these servers are highly available.
How to do it…
In this recipe, we will discuss the irst alternative of deploying AD FS on the same server as 
that of CRM frontend roles using separate ports, that is, AD FS on Port 443 and Dynamics 
CRM 2011 on Port 444, both using HTTPS.
1. Log in to the server machine on which AD FS is installed with local administrative 
permissions. As a irst step, we have to secure the AD FS website, that is, the default 
website using a Wildcard certiicate.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
112
2. Launch the IIS Manager console. Then right-click on the default website and select 
Edit Bindings. Then, click on the Add… button. The Add Site Binding page will 
appear. Here, we need to specify the values for Type (https), IP address, and  
Port (443) and pick the value for SSL certiicate.
3. The next step will be to bind the Wildcard certiicate with the Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM 2011 website. To achieve this, follow the Securing Dynamics CRM 2011 
deployment with SSL/HTTPS recipe in this chapter.
4. Then, we have to create DNS entries for AD FS and CRM.
5. In this case, we will conigure our AD FS and CRM to be on the packt.com domain. 
AD FS will be using adfs.packt.com, and Dynamics CRM 2011 will be using crm.
packt.com, as URLs.
6. Thereafter, AD FS is required to be conigured. Navigate to Start | All Programs | 
Administrative Tools | AD FS 2.0 Management. This will bring up the AD FD 2.0 
Management console. Then, click on the AD FS 2.0 Federation Server Coniguration 
Wizard button on the Actions pane. This will bring up the AD FS 2.0 Federation 
Server Coniguration Wizard page. Select Create a new Federation Service here 
and click on the Next button.

Chapter 3
113
7. 
The Select Stand-Alone or Farm Deployment page appears. Here, we have to  
select an appropriate deployment option between New Federation server farm  
and Stand-alone federation server.
A federation server farm is used when we have to scale with increasing demand and 
is the recommended option for live deployments. Stand-alone federation servers are 
recommended for development and testing purposes. Though in-depth discussion 
of federation server farms is beyond the scope of this recipe, expanding a federation 
server is always optional.
8. We will choose Stand–alone Federation Server here and proceed. Once the 
deployment choice has been made, please click on Next.
9. Next, the Specify the Federation Service Name page appears. On this page,  
provide values for SSL certiicate, Port, and Federation Service name,  
and proceed by clicking on Next.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
114
10. By default, the wizard will retrieve the SSL certiicate conigured in IIS and will use 
the subject name speciied there. However, in case of any ambiguity regarding the 
subject name, the Federation Service name combo box will be enabled and a valid 
service name can be provided.
11. On the Specify Service Account page, we have to select an account under which 
the service will run. The recommendation is to use a speciic service account for 
this purpose. The service account will be granted SeServiceLogonRight and 
SeAuditPrivilege by the coniguration wizard. Use the Browse button to select 
the service account, enter the password for the account, and then click on Next  
to proceed.

12. The Ready to Apply Settings page appears. Click on Next to proceed.
13. Finally comes the Coniguration Results page; click on Close to complete the  
AD FS conigurations.
14. After inishing the AD FS coniguration, we need to conigure Dynamics CRM 2011 for 
Claims-based authentication. Log in to the machine where Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
2011 Deployment Manager is installed and launch the console with the credentials 
of a Deployment Administrator account.
15. Then, click on the Microsoft Dynamics CRM node in the Object Explorer window; in 
the Actions pane, click on Conigure Claims-Based Authentication and then click  
on Next.
16. On the next page, specify the value for Federation metadata URL and click on Next.

17. On the next screen, select the Wildcard certiicate that has been associated with the 
AD FS default web site and then click on Next.
18. Click on Next to navigate forward, and the System Checks page will display the

How it works…
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 replaces form-based authentication with Claims-based 
authentication to enable Internet access for external users not accessing CRM via VPN. 
Claims-based authentication is built on Windows Identity Foundation (WIF). One of the 
common scenarios where Claims-based authentication inds use is when Dynamics CRM 
2011 has to be deployed as an Internet-facing application.
Another deployment scenario is where the user of a domain tries to access an instance of 
Dynamics CRM 2011 that is installed on another domain and there exists no trust between 
these two domains. In such a case, Claims-based authentication helps Dynamics CRM 2011 
to authenticate users from a non-trusted domain.
When Dynamics CRM 2011 is conigured to use AD FS, every user's sign-on request is 
redirected to a sign-in page where the user is expected to enter his or her credentials. Behind 
the scenes, the sign-in page checks all of the directories (called identity providers) that it 
trusts to verify whether the user's credentials are valid. If the user's credentials are found 
valid, the sign-in page provides the user with a token, and it is this token that the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 application (called relying party) accepts as authentication.

Coniguring Internet-facing Deployment (IFD)
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 supports Internet-facing Deployment (IFD) so that remote 
users can connect to the application through the Internet. The following Internet-facing 
Deployment conigurations are supported:
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for internal users only
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for internal users and IFD access
 
f
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for IFD-only access
Coniguring an IFD enables access to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 from the Internet outside 
the company irewall without the need for a virtual private network (VPN) solution. Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 conigured for Internet access uses Claims-based authentication to 
verify the credentials of external users. When Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 is conigured for 
Internet access, integrated Windows authentication must remain in place for internal users.
To let users access the application over the Internet, the server that is IIS and where the 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 application is installed must be available over the Internet.
One prerequisite for this is having AD FS2.0 installed on the default website in any machine 
within the domain. Dynamics CRM 2011 cannot be operated from port 80 if AD FS is being 
installed on the same machine where Dynamics CRM 2011 is installed.
Before you start coniguring Dynamics CRM 2011 for Internet-facing Deployment you need to 
have completed the Coniguring Claims-based authentication (AD FS) for Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM 2011 recipe.
How to do it…
Please follow the ensuing steps to conigure Internet-facing Deployment:
1. Log in to the machine where Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Deployment Manager  
is installed.
2. Launch Microsoft Dynamics CRM Deployment Manager using a Deployment 
Administrator account. This is usually present in Start | All Programs | Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 | Deployment Manager.

Chapter 3
123
3. Select the Microsoft Dynamics CRM node in the Object Explorer window, and then 
click on the Conigure Internet-Facing Deployment option in the Actions pane.
4. On the Conigure Internet-Facing Deployment page, click on the Next button  
to proceed.
5. On the next screen, provide the URLs for Web Application Server Domain, 
Organization Server Domain, and Discovery Web Service Domain.
In our case, as the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server roles are installed on the same 
server, the URLs in Web Application Server Domain, Organization Web Service 
Domain, and Discovery Web Service Domain will be the same.
Domain names must use the SSL Port.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
124
6. On the next screen, enter the external domain where your Internet-facing servers are 
located and click on the Next button. 
7. 
We have to conigure the Internet to our Dynamics CRM 2011 server located outside 
the domain of information. The domain has to be a subdomain of the Web Application 
Server domain. The default value would be auth.<Web Application Server 
Domain>.
8. On the System Checks page, check for warnings or errors. All warnings and errors 
have to be ixed before proceeding. If there are no warnings or errors, click on Next  
to proceed.
9. The Review your selections and then click on Apply page then appears; here, click 
on Apply.
10. Finally, click on Finish to complete the task.
The next step will be adding a relying party trust in AD FS. Please follow the ensuing steps to 
achieve this:
1. Log on to the machine where AD FS is installed. Launch AD FS 2.0 Federation Server 
Coniguration Wizard, and click on Add Relying Party Trust on the Actions pane. 
Click on Start to proceed.
2. Enter the federation metadata address and click on the Next button.

4. On the Choose Issuance Authorization Rules page, choose Permit all users to 
access this relying party and click on Next to proceed.
5. On the Ready to Add Trust page, check the trust details and click on Next.
6. Then select the relying party that just got created and click on Edit Claim Rules on 
the Actions pane.
7. 
Thereafter, click on the Add Rule button in Rules Editor.
Now create the User Principal Name by adding the following values:
 

Claim rule template: Pass Through or Filter an Incoming Claim
 

Claim rule name: UPN
Click on Finish.
8. Thereafter, click again on Add Rule in Rules Editor.
Now create the Primary SID by adding the following values:
 

Claim rule template: Pass Through or Filter an Incoming Claim
 

Claim rule name: Primary SID
Click on Finish.


Claim rule name: Windows Account name to name
Click on Finish.
10. Once these three rules have been added, there will be three issuance  
transform rules.
11. Finally perform an IIS Reset.
How it works…
Internet-facing Deployment enables users to access Dynamics CRM 2011 over the Internet 
from outside the company's network and without VPN. Dynamics CRM 2011 takes advantage 
of Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), a standards-based technology for controlling 
security access to Internet services while Internet-facing Deployment is conigured.
Without having Claims-based authentication enabled, Internet-facing Deployment cannot  
be conigured.

Creating a new deployment administrator
In the Dynamics CRM 2011 system, there are two separate types of administrators: 
deployment administrators and system administrators. A deployment administrator is a 
deployment-level administrator and manages deployment properties and activities. A system 
administrator is an organization-level administrator and administers the Dynamics CRM 2011 
system settings. In this recipe, we will discuss how to create new deployment administrators 
in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
Getting ready
The deployment administrator role is a role very important to administering Dynamics CRM 
2011 Server. With the installation of the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server component, an MMC 
snap-in called Deployment Manager gets installed. Deployment administrators have complete 
and unrestricted access to perform deployment manager tasks on all organizations and 
servers in a Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 deployment. The deployment administrator is 
expected to carry out the following activities on the system:
 
f
Creating organizations
 
f
Managing organizations
 
f
Importing organizations
 
f
Disabling organizations
The installation user is added as the deployment administrator to the Dynamics CRM 2011 
system by default, but it is always advisable to add backup deployment administrators. 
How to do it…
Proceed with the following steps to create a new deployment administrator in the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 system. These steps should be performed on the Active Directory Federation 
Services machine:
1. Create a new Active Directory Group for deployment administrators.
2. Create a new Active Directory user account for backup administrators if it does 
not already exist. Then add the user account to the newly created deployment 
administrator security group.
3. Add this deployment administrator domain group to the following Dynamics CRM 
2011 speciic Active Directory Groups:
 

ReportingGroup
 

PrivUserGroup
 

SQLAccessGroup

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011

4. The deployment administrators group should have the following types of access to 
the preceding security groups:
Permissions
 
f
Read
 
f
Write
 
f
Add/remove self as member
Advanced 
permissions
 
f
List contents
 
f
Read all properties
 
f
Write all properties
 
f
Read permissions
 
f
Modify permissions
 
f
All validated writes
 
f
Add/remove self as member
Perform these steps in the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server machine(s):
1. Add the deployment administrator domain group to all the Dynamics CRM 2011 
servers' local administrator groups, if not already added.
2. Log on to the Dynamics CRM 2011 server machine on which the Deployment Tools 
role is installed as the user who has installed the Dynamics CRM 2011 Server or as  
a user who is already a deployment administrator.
3. Then click on Start | All Programs | Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 |  
Deployment Manager.
4. Right-click on Deployment Administrator and select New Deployment Administrator.
5. Add the backup deployment administrator user account, and then click on OK.

Chapter 3
129
Perform the following steps on the SQL server machine:
1. Log on to the SQL server machine as the user who has installed Dynamics CRM 2011 
Server or as a user who is already a deployment administrator.
2. Add the deployment administrator domain group to the local administrators' group,  
if not already added.
3. Launch SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the server.
4. Then expand Security, right-click on Logins, and then select New Login.
5. The Login – New page will appear. Click on the Search button beside the Login 
name textbox.
6. In the Select User or Group dialog box, click on Object Types and enable the Groups 
type; then, click on OK.
7. 
Click on Locations, select Entire Directory, and then click on OK.

8. In the Enter the object name to select textbox, type the deployment administrator 
domain group name, click on the Check Names button, and then click on OK.
9. In the Default database drop-down menu, select MSCRM_CONFIG.
10. From the left-hand navigation of the Login – New page, select Server Roles and then 
enable the sysadmin role. Click on the OK button.
11. Then expand the MSCRM_CONFIG database and expand Security. Right-click on 
Users and then select New User.

Chapter 3
131
12. In the User Name textbox, type the backup administrator's domain login name (in the 
format domain\username).
13. In the Database role membership section, check the db_owner checkbox and then 
click on OK.
14. Close SQL Server Management Studio.
How it works…
The user who is the deployment administrator is not automatically added to the existing 
organization. However, the user can be added to an existing organization as a user in 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011.
The deployment administrator is the system administrator of any organization that the 
deployment administrator creates or imports. Additionally, the deployment administrator  
has access to the organization in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011.
Creating a new system administrator
A system administrator is a Dynamics CRM 2011 organization-level administrator, and by 
default, the installation user is added as a user in the system with the system administrator 
security role assigned. Any user assigned the system administrator security role is known as a 
system administrator within the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. This user will have all possible 
access within that organization.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
132
How to do it…
Follow these steps to create a new system administrator in any Dynamics  
CRM 2011 organization:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system with a user account that was used to 
install Dynamics CRM 2011 or as a user who is already a system administrator  
in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
2. Navigate to Settings | Administration | User. Then click on the New button on the 
top ribbon.
3. In the User New page, enter the username in for the new system 
administrator into the User Name ield in the format domain\username.
4. The User Information section will automatically be populated with details 
pulled from Active Directory. We can modify these details here.
5. In the Client Access License (CAL) Information section, select Access 
Mode as Administrative.
6. Then click on the Save button on the top ribbon.
7. 
Once the record is saved, click on the Manage Roles button on the top ribbon.
8. On the Manage User Roles page, check the System Administrator checkbox 
and then click on OK.
9. If you wish to modify the business unit of the user, click on the Change 
Business Unit button on the top ribbon.
10. Select the right business unit from the business unit lookup and then click on OK.
How it works…
The system administrator will have the highest level of access to the Dynamics CRM 
2011 entities within the organization. When any custom entity is created, all the system 
administrators, by default, get full access to these entities. We will use a system administrator 
user to administer the Dynamics CRM 2011 system settings.
Creating a new business unit
Business units are security containers in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Business units 
contain users and teams inside a Dynamics CRM 2011 organization and are created to 
separate users and teams with different security requirements. Business units might  
(but not necessarily) correspond to an organization's departments or divisions.

Chapter 3
133
A business unit can be the parent of another business unit, and the irst business unit created 
inside a Dynamics CRM 2011 organization is known as the parent business unit. One or more 
business units can be created under it; these are known as child business units.
A root business unit is automatically created by Dynamics CRM 2011 when a Dynamics CRM 
organization is created. This business unit cannot be renamed, disabled, or deleted and does 
not have any parent business unit.
Business units can also own records. If an entity ownership type is set to Business Owned, 
the business unit alone can own records for that entity.
In this recipe we will discuss how to create new child business units.
How to do it…
Please follow these steps to create a child business unit:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 organization with a system administrator or 
equivalent security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Administration | Business Units. Then click on the New 
button on the top ribbon.
3. In the Business Unit: New form, provide the following details:
 

Name: Name of the business unit. The name has to be unique.
 

Parent Business: Provide a parent business unit. Use the Lookup button to 
select the parent business unit.
We can also (optionally) provide the phone numbers, e-mail address,  
and address details.
4. Then, click on Save and Close to create the new business unit.
How it works…
After creating a business unit, users and teams can be assigned to it. Security roles are 
deined at the business unit level, and a child business unit inherits all the security roles 
deined in its parent business unit. When we create a business unit, a team with the same 
name gets created and every user that is added to the business unit gets automatically added 
to that team.
The parent of a business unit can be changed. When a business unit is reassigned to a new 
parent business unit, all its child business units move with it, along with their users, teams, 
and so on.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
134
A circular relationship is not permitted within a business 
unit hierarchy. If business unit A is parent of business unit B 
and business unit B is parent of business unit C, business 
unit C cannot be parent of business unit A.
Business units (except root business units) can be disabled. This can be done by selecting the 
business unit and then clicking on More Actions | Disable from the toolbar. There are certain 
important considerations for disabling a business unit:
 
f
Disabling a business unit will also disable all its child business units.
 
f
Users of a disabled business unit are not disabled but they cannot log in to  
the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Hence, the user licenses of such users are  
not withdrawn.
 
f
Users, teams, or child business units cannot be assigned to a disabled business unit.
 
f
Users who relied on membership of teams for access to certain resources will not be 
able to access those resources if the business unit is disabled.
A disabled business unit can be enabled at any time. Select the Inactive Business Units 
view and then select the business unit to be enabled. Click on More Actions | Enable from 
the toolbar to enable a business unit. When a business unit is enabled, all the child business 
units are also enabled automatically.
Finally, business units (except root business units) can also be deleted. To delete a business 
unit, it irst has to be disabled. Only disabled business units can be deleted. To delete a 
business unit, select the Inactive Business Units view and then select the business unit to be 
deleted. Click on More Actions | Delete on the toolbar. A few important considerations when 
deleting a business unit are:
 
f
A business unit with child business units cannot be deleted. Hence, before deleting 
any business unit all its child business units have to be deleted or reparented.
 
f
For a business unit with teams (except the default team), users cannot be deleted 
unless these teams and users are not reassigned.
 
f
Business unit deletion cannot be undone.
Coniguring a security role
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 provides a security model that ensures data integrity and 
privacy. The security model has the following levels:
 
f
Role-based security: Groups a set of privileges for a user in a security role. A security 
role can be assigned to a user or a team and determines what the user or team 
members can and cannot do in a Dynamics CRM 2011 organization.

Chapter 3
135
 
f
Field-level security: Restricts access to ields in an entity only to speciied users  
or teams.
Security roles are core to the role-based security model. The security role has two main 
concepts: privileges and access levels. Combined, these two concepts deine a security 
role. The privileges associated with a security role are groups in various tabs in the UI of 
the security role. These are the privilege grouping tabs for any security role: Core Records, 
Marketing, Sales, Service, Business Management, Service Management, Customization, 
and Custom Entities.
The Dynamics CRM 2011 system will already have a few security roles conigured by default. 
These are known as system-deined security roles or standard security roles. Except for 
the system administrator security role. the other roles can be customized to it in with the 
functional security model. New security roles can also be created under any business unit.
In this recipe, we will discuss how to customize an existing security role and how to create a 
custom security role.
How to do it…
To customize an existing security role, follow these steps to customize an existing security role:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user who has the system 
administrator security role.
2. Navigate to the Settings | Administration | Security Role section.
If we intend to customize any default or standard 
security roles offered by Dynamics CRM 2011, 
the best practice is to copy the security role with a 
different name and then customize the newly created 
security role.
3. Then, select the security role to be customized and double-click on the security role 
name to open its settings.
4. The next step is to customize the security role:
 

Change the security role name: Navigate to the Details tab and modify the 
Role Name field.
 

Customize entity-level access rights: Navigate to the security role UI tab 
where the specific entity is present. Then set the access level for various 
access rights of the entity.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
136
 

Customize the miscellaneous privileges: There is a set of privileges that is 
not linked to any entity; rather, they are tasks that can be performed within 
the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. To customize any such privilege, navigate 
to the tab where the privilege is listed and then set the access level.
5. Finally, click on the Save and Close button on the top ribbon.
Creating a custom security role can be achieved in two ways:
 
f
Copying an existing security role and then modifying it; this can be done as follows:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user that has the system 
administrator security role.
2. Navigate to the Settings | Administration | Security Role section.
3. Select the security role to be copied, click on More Actions in the toolbar, 
and select Copy Role.
4. The Copy Security Role pop-up will appear. Provide the name for the new 
role and click on the OK button.
When a security role is created by copying an existing 
security role, the new security role will be created under 
the same business unit of the existing security role that 
was copied and the business unit cannot be modified.
5. Then, modify the required access levels for various access rights of  
the available entities and miscellaneous privileges according to the 
functional need.
6. Finally, click on the Save and Close button on the top ribbon.
 
f
Creating a new security role; this can be done with the following steps:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user that has the system 
administrator security role.
2. Navigate to the Settings | Administration | Security Role section.
3. Click on New in the toolbar.
4. The Security Role: New page appears. On this page, provide the role name 
and business unit information.
5. Then, set the required access levels for the various access rights of  
the available entities and miscellaneous privileges according to the 
functional need.

Chapter 3
137
When a custom security role is created, organization-level read 
access is provided for the following entities by default: Plug-in 
Assembly, Plug-in Type, SDK Message, SDK Message Processing 
Step, and SDK Message Processing Step Image. These entities 
can be found under the Customization tab of the security role.
6. Finally, click on the Save and Close button on the top ribbon.
How it works…
The security role is a three-dimensional model in Dynamics CRM 2011. These three 
dimensions in combination decide what a user or a member of a team can access  
within the system. The three dimensions are:
 
f
Entity
 
f
Privileges
 
f
Access Level
Entities are the units within the Dynamics CRM 2011 Security Role model to which an access 
level is applied for every privilege. 
The security role privileges deine the access rights granted to a user for a particular entity 
instance. The access rights are as follows:
Access Right
Description
Read
This access right controls whether the user can read the entity instance.
Write
This access right controls whether the user can update the entity instance.
Assign
This access right controls whether the user can assign the entity instance to 
another user.
Append
This access right controls whether the user can attach another entity instance 
to the specified entity instance. 
Append To
This access right controls whether the user can attach the entity instance in 
question to another entity instance.
Share
This access right controls whether the user can share the entity instance with 
another user or team.
Delete
This access right controls whether the user can delete the entity instance.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
138
The Append and Append To access rights work in combination with one another. Every time 
a user wants to attach an entity instance to another entity instance, the user must have both 
rights. For example, when a user wants to attach a note to a case, the user must have the 
Append access right on the note and the Append To access right on the case for the operation 
to work.
Most of the preceding access rights have dependencies on other access roles for proper 
functioning. For example, a user may have the Create access right to an entity, but unless the 
user has read access to the same entity, he cannot create an instance of the entity and be the 
owner at the same time. The following table describes the access right dependencies for the 
actions speciied:
Action
Access rights required
To create a record of an entity and be the owner of the record
Create, Read
To share a record of an entity
Share, Read
To assign a record of an entity
Assign, Write, Read
To append to an entity record
Read, Append To
To append an entity record
Read, Append
The security role access level determines the depth of access. The following are the  
access levels:
Access Level name
Notation
Description
None
No access is granted
User
Access is granted to the entity instances owned by the 
user or shared with the user or shared with a team of 
which the user is a member.

Access is granted on the entity instances owned by 
someone within the user's own business unit. 
Parent-child business 
unit
Access is granted on the entity instances owned by 
someone within the user's own business unit or within 
a child business unit of the user.
Organization
Access is granted to the entity instances owned by 
anyone within the user's organization.
If a custom entity is created in the system, all security roles except 
for system administrator have to be conigured to provide relevant 
access to this entity.

There's more...
There is something more with security roles:
 
f
If we decide to create a new child business unit for a parent business unit, all the 
security roles of the parent business unit will be copied to the child business unit  
as an inherited role. Inherited security roles can neither be modiied nor deleted.
 
f
If we want to customize any security role, it can only be done in the business unit  
that the security role was created in.
 
f
If we change any security role, the changes made will cascade down to all the child 
business units as well.
 
f
If we wish to create a security role that is available to the whole organization, we have 
to create it under the root business unit.
 
f
Security roles are very tightly coupled with business units. Hence a user who wishes 
to create a new security role has to be a member of that business unit or any parent 
business unit.
 
f
It is technically possible to create security roles with the same name under different 
business units. However, best practice recommends assigning such security roles to 
the parent business unit.
Creating a custom administrator security 
role
The Dynamics CRM 2011 system has an out-of-the-box system administrator security 
role. But, at times, we want to create custom administrator security roles to provide some 
restrictive administrative tasks to a set of users. For example, we want to provide the right 
to create users, teams, queues, goals, currencies and so on, but restrict access to solution 
management, entity customization, and so on. In this recipe, we will explore the best way to 
create such a custom administrator security role.
How to do it…
Please follow the ensuing steps to create a custom administrator security role:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user that has the system 
administrator security role.
2. Navigate to the Settings | Administration | Security Role section.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011

3. Then, select the System Administrator security role, click on More Actions in the 
toolbar, and then select Copy Role.
4. In the Copy Security Role web pop-up, provide a new role name and then click on OK.
5. The custom administrator security role page opens. Customize the new security role as 
per the functional need. Then, click on the Save and Close button on the top ribbon.
How it works…
We have created a custom administrator security role in this recipe. After that, we have to 
assign this security role to the custom administrator users. Custom administrator users 
should have both Access Mode and License Type set to Administrative.
This user can perform administrative functions and assign all roles (except the system 
administrator role) to other users but cannot work with Sales, Marketing, and Service  
(except view the knowledge base).

Chapter 3
141
One more important fact for Dynamics CRM 2011 is that, until the release of Update Rollup 
10, if there are custom entities, the custom administrator cannot assign a security role—
which has more privileges than the custom administrator role—to any user. Update Rollup 
10 for Dynamics CRM 2011 has enabled the AllowRoleAssignInAdminMode option for 
users in the administrative mode. This is a registry subkey to be added under HKEY_LOCAL_
MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSCRM with the value 1.
The custom administrative security role should have the following rights to be able to assign 
security roles to another user:
 
f
Organization-level read access to the User, User Settings, and Security Role entities
 
f
Append and Append To permissions to the User entity
Creating a ield-level security proile
Using ield-level security, access to certain ields can be restricted to some speciic users or 
teams. However, ield-level security cannot be applied to all ields. Field-level security can be 
applied to:
 
f
Only custom ields for system entities
 
f
All ields for any custom entity
Field-level security is applied by creating ield-level security proiles. Fields with ield-level 
security enabled can be added to these proiles. Finally, a user or team is associated with 
every ield-level security proile. The ield-level security rules will be applicable to these users 
or members of the teams.
How to do it…
Follow these steps to conigure a ield-level security proile:
1. Set the Field Security ield to Enable for all those ields to be included in the  
ield-level security proile.
2. Publish the entity by clicking on Publish.
3. Create a ield-level security proile. This can be done by navigating to  
Settings | Administration | Field Security Proiles and then clicking  
on the New button on the ribbon to create a new ield-level security proile.
4. Provide a name and description for the proile and then click on the Save 
button on the ribbon.
5. Then click on Members | Teams under the Related section. Add teams to this proile 
by clicking on the Add button under the Team Associated View. If no team is required 
to be added to this ield-level security proile, this step can be skipped.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
142
6. Finally, conigure the ield-level security access rights by navigating to Field 
Permissions under the Common section. This section will list all the ields  
for which ield-level security has been conigured.
7. 
Now, click on the ield name and then select Edit in the top area of the  
section. This will bring up the Edit Field Security page. Set the access  
mode for Read, Update, and Create for this speciic ield.
8. Repeat the preceding step for all the ields listed in this proile.
9. Finally, click on the Save and Close button on the top ribbon.
How it works…
Field-level security restricts the access to a ield for a set of users. When a user opens up a 
record form, unless the user has read access to a ield for which ield-level security has been 
enabled, the user will not be able to see the value for the ield. When a user wants to share 
a record with someone else, the user can provide access only to those secure ields to which 
the user has access. 
Enabling ield-level security has other implications as well inside the Dynamics CRM 2011 
system. In the Retrieve and RetrieveMultiple queries, if a secure ield is used in the 
column set, the column will not have any value returned unless the caller (or impersonated 
user) has read access to the secure ield.
If a secure ield is used in the ilter condition of the query, the condition involving the  
secure ield will be replaced by null during the condition evaluation unless the caller  
(or impersonated user) has read access to the secure ield.
If the secure ield is used to order the result set, the order by condition at SQL level will 
consider the value to be null for the secure ield.
Adding a new user account in the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 system
A user is any individual who is associated with the business unit and uses the Dynamics CRM 
2011 system. Any user can only be associated with only one business unit. Let us irst delve 
into the recipe for adding a single user at a time in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Follow these steps to add a user in Dynamics CRM 2011:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user with the system administrator or 
equivalent security role.

Chapter 3
143
2. Navigate to the Settings | Administration | Users section. 
3. Click on the New button on the ribbon.
4. In the New User form, enter a value in the User Name ield in the format of Domain 
Name\Logon Name. Then, press Tab or click on any other ield in the form. This will 
fetch user information about the user from Active Directory.
5. We can modify the user information values fetched from Active Directory.
6. Then, we can enter information for these sections: Organization Information, E-mail 
Access Coniguration, Addresses, and Default Queue.
7. 
Then, enter the values in the Client Access License (CAL) Information form.
8. Click on the Save button on the top ribbon.
9. Once the user record is created, click on the Manage Roles button on the  
top ribbon to set the security role for the user. In the Manage User Roles  
pop-up, select the security roles to be assigned to the user and then select OK.
10. If the user has to be added to some teams, click on the Join Teams button on the top 
ribbon. When the Teams Lookup pop up appears, select the teams the user should 
be part of and then click on the OK button.
11. The Change Business Unit button can be used if the business unit of the 
user has to be modiied.
12. The Change Manager button can be used if the manager of the user is to  
be modiied.

How it works…
Adding users is pretty simple in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. It mainly involves 
information about the user's login details, account information, and demographic information. 
One important piece of information entered here is the client access information. This 
section has two important attributes of a system user entity: Access Mode and License Type.
Access Mode: The Access Mode speciies the type of access the user has on the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 system. The following are the possible values for the ield:
Access mode
Description
Administrative
If we set the access mode to Administrative for a user, the user 
can access the Settings section but cannot access the Sales, 
Marketing, and Services sections in the system.
Non-interactive
Such types of users can only access the system via Dynamics 
CRM Web Service not via the user interface.
Read
The user will have only read access to the system.
Read-Write
The user will have both read and write access
Support User
Such users are created by the Microsoft Dynamics Support 
team.
The default form for the User entity does not show the Non-interactive and Support 
User options. It is scripted for these to be hidden. To make them visible in the form, 
customize the form to add the Access Mode attribute again. When we add a new ield in the 
UI for Access Mode, all the preceding options will be visible in the drop-down list. Another way 
would be to set the Access Mode using Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK.
Non-interactive users are usually used in Service-to-Service code because 
such users do not use a license. Dynamics CRM 2011 Online supports only 
ive free non-interactive users.
License Type: This ield speciies the Client Access License (CAL) type. The following values 
are available to choose from:
License Type
Description
Administrative
The user will have administrative rights.
Device Full
The user who is using the device running Dynamics CRM 2011 will 
have both read and write access.
Device Limited
The user who is using the device running Dynamics CRM 2011 will 
have only read access.
Full
The user has both read and write access.
Limited
The user only has read access.

Chapter 3
145
When a user leaves the organization, reassign all the active records owned by this user to 
another active user and deactivate the current user. The deactivated user does not use  
up licenses, and this way, we can regain a license for a user who no longer belongs to  
the organization.
When we create a user, we must assign the user at least one security role. 
Even if the user is part of a team that has assigned roles, the user should be 
assigned a role.
There's more…
Dynamics CRM 2011 includes more security settings for approving e-mail addresses of the 
user before they can be used by the e-mail router. To update the security settings, navigate 
to the Settings | Administration | System Settings | E-mail tab and deselect the checkbox 
next to Process e-mails only for approved users.
As a result of this change, each user's e-mail address has to be approved before e-mails can 
be processed by the e-mail router. This can be achieved by launching each individual user's 
records and then by clicking on the Approve E-mail button on the ribbon.
 
In the Conirm Primary E-mail Approval pop up, click on OK to approve and close the window. 
The e-mail address can be rejected by clicking on the Reject E-mail button on the ribbon.

Adding multiple users in the Dynamics CRM 
2011 system
In this recipe we will ind out how to add multiple users in the system at a time. The process 
of adding multiple users is slightly different from the Adding a new user account in Dynamic 
CRM 2011 recipe. When a single user is added at a time, we assign the security role of the 
user after adding the user in the system. When we add multiple users using the multiple user 
addition wizard, we select the security role irst and then add the users; hence, users with the 
same security roles are usually added together.
How to do it…
Follow these steps to add multiple users in the system at a time:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user with the system administrator or 
an equivalent security role.
2. Navigate to the Settings | Administration | Users section. 
3. Then, click on the New Multiple Users button on the top ribbon.
4. In the Select Business Unit page, select the Business Unit from the drop-
down, under which all the users will be added, and then click on Next to continue.
5. The Select Security Roles page appears; here, select the correct security 
roles from the Security Roles list that will be applied to all the users to be added. 
Then click on Next.
6. On the Select Access and License Type page, select the appropriate values for 
Access Type, License Type, and E-mail Access Coniguration. The selected  
Access Mode and License Type will be applied to all the users to be added here.  
Then click on Next to proceed.
7. 
Then the Select Domain or Group page appears; here, select one of the 
following options:
1. Select users from all trusted domains or groups: Choose this option if 
users to be added are spread across different domains or groups
2. Select users from the following domains or groups: Choose this option is 
users to be added are part of one common domain or group.
After the selection, please click on Next to proceed.
8. On the Select Users page, please specify the usernames in the domainName\
logonName format, delimited by semicolons between usernames. Then, click on the 
Lookup (lens) button on the right-hand side. Once all the user names are resolved, 
click on the Create New Users button to create all the users in the system.

Chapter 3
147
9. Finally, on the Summary page, click on Close if you want to inish. If you intend to add 
more users, click on the Add More Users button and follow the current recipe from 
step 1 again.
10. Some information about the users, such as address information, can only be 
added by opening each of the added users and then entering the data.
11. To assign a manager to these users, please open each of the users, click on 
the Change Manager button on the top ribbon, and set the manager.
12. If these users have to be added to some teams, launch each of the user's records 
and then click on the Join Teams button on the top ribbon. When the Teams Lookup 
pop up appears, select the teams the user should be part of and then click on the  
OK button.
How it works…
Multiple user addition helps us to add users of the same type, who share the same security 
roles, access type, license type, and e-mail coniguration, in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system 
at one go.
There is another way to add multiple users at a time and that is by using the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 system's Import Data wizard. This wizard can be accessed by navigating to the 
Workplace | My Work | Imports section and then clicking on the Import Data button on the 
top ribbon. The Import Data Wizard will be discussed in Chapter 4, Data Management. But 
one important point about importing user data is that only the attributes of the User entity can 
be speciied in the Import Data wizard. The security role of the user cannot be speciied during 
user import.
The Dynamics CRM 2011 system will assign the Salesperson security role 
to all the users imported using the Import Data wizard. If the Salesperson 
role is deleted from the system, the Import Data wizard cannot create users 
during an import.
There's more…
Users added to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system cannot be deleted but can be disabled. To 
disable users, navigate to System | Administration | Users and then select the users to be 
disabled. Finally, click on the Disable button in the top ribbon to disable them.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
148
Once a user record is disabled inside the Dynamics CRM 2011 system, the following  
will happen:
 
f
The user cannot log on to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system
 
f
The user stops consuming Client Access Licenses (CALs)
 
f
Published worklows or dialogs owned by the user stop working
 
f
Records can no longer be assigned to this user
A disabled user can be enabled at any time by clicking the Enable button on the User  
entity's top ribbon. When a disabled user is re-enabled, the user will consume a Client  
Access License.
Creating a new team in the Dynamics CRM 
2011 system
A team is a group of users and allows groups of users to share information in an organization. 
In this recipe we will delve into how to create a team in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Follow this recipe to create a team in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user with the system administrator or 
an equivalent security role.
2. Navigate to the Settings | Administration | Teams section.
3. Click on the New button on the top ribbon.
4. In the Team New page, please enter the following information:
 

Team Name: Enter a unique name for the team that describes the team's 
purpose, business focus, location, or other meaningful characteristics.
 

Business Unit: The business unit to which the team belongs. One team can 
only be part of one business unit. This is a mandatory field.
 

Administrator: Select a user from the lookup. This user will be the 
administrator of the team. This is a mandatory field.
 

Default Queue: Select the team's queue from the lookup.
 

Description: Enter a description for the team, if any.

Chapter 3
149
5. Then click on the Save button on the top ribbon.
6. Click on the Manage Roles button on the top ribbon to assign security roles 
to the team.
7. 
Then, navigate to the Related | Common | Members section. Then click on 
the Add Members button on the ribbon.
8. To remove users from a team, select the members and then click on the 
Remove button on the ribbon.
9. In the User Lookup pop up, select team members and then click on the Add button. 
Click on the OK button to close the pop up.
How it works…
A team is an important construct in Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Each team must be 
assigned a security role and must have an administrator.
After creation of the team, we add members to it. Though a team belongs to only one 
business unit, users from multiple business units can be added as team members. When 
team members are reassigned to different business units within the organization, we can 
remove them from one team and add them to another. We can also remove team members 
when they leave the organization.
When we assign a security role to a team, the security role is also assigned to all the users 
based on the business unit of the team. When a user is assigned a team, the user can 
perform any task on behalf of the team; however, the user does not necessarily inherit the 
access rights of the team.

Administering Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011
150
Let us take an example. Let us add a custom entity Subscription in the system and then 
customize the Sales Manager security role to provide the following access rights to  
this entity:
Now create a new team with the name Sales Team and assign the Sales Manager 
security role to this team. Thereafter, assume we have a user John Smith in the system with 
the security role Salesperson assigned. The Salesperson security role has no access 
rights to the Subscription entity. The user John Smith is added to Sales Team. Now 
log in to Dynamics CRM as John Smith and try to create a subscription record. During 
the record save, the system will throw the Access is denied error. Now if John Smith had 
inherited the access rights of the team's security role, that is, Sales Manager, John Smith 
would have been able to save the record. Now change the owner of the record to the team 
Sales Team and save the record. This save attempt will be successful. Here, John Smith 
was able to impersonate his team and was able to create the record.
A team, too, can own records and can provide access by sharing those records with the team 
members. Sharing a record with a team essentially shares it with all the members of the team 
irrespective of their business units.
Coniguring autonumbering formats
Some entities within the Dynamics CRM 2011 system use an automatic incremental 
numbering system to uniquely identity individual records. This automatic numbering system 
comes with a default coniguration. In this recipe we will ind out how to update these  
default settings.
How to do it…
Follow these steps to conigure the autonumbering formats:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user with the system administrator or 
an equivalent security role.
2. Navigate to the Settings | Administration section and click on Auto-Numbering.
3. Set the Auto-Numbering value in the web pop-up that is launched. This page will 
have multiple tabs listing the entities that use autonumbering in the system.

Chapter 3
151
4. Click on the tabs and modify the value in the Preix ield and/or the Sufix Length 
ield of the Auto-Number page as follows:
 

Prefix: We can enter up to three characters, symbols, or numbers
 

Suffix Length: We can select a value of 4, 5, or 6 from the drop-down list
Articles does not have a Suffix Length option.
5. Finally, click on the OK button to save and close the changes.
How it works…
Any autonumber has three parts: a ixed preix, an incremental number, and a changing sufix.
Preixes have a maximum length of three and are used for all system-generated numbers for 
the selected record type. If we change the preix for a record type, it will not change the preix 
of numbers that have already been assigned.
For every entity other than Article, we can specify the length of the automatically generated 
alphanumeric sufix of the autonumber. The sufix is used for records that are created while 
the user is ofline and for which the number cannot be guaranteed to be unique.

Coniguring system-wide settings
The system settings in the Dynamics CRM 2011 is the largest group of settings and each 
of them affects the whole system as such. These are conigurable settings and might need 
modiications to meet business requirements. System settings are grouped into the following 
10 headers depending on their nature:
Tab/group name
Description
General
Specifies the name format, currency display options, how records are 
shared, and whether attachments are allowed
Calendar
Sets the maximum length of an appointment
Formats
Specifies the regional display format for number, currency, time,  
and date
Auditing
Specifies the start of auditing and what areas within the system should 
be audited
E-mail
Sets the options that control how e-mail is tracked and managed
Marketing
Specifies the options that control how marketing campaign e-mail 
features are managed
Customization
Specifies whether Dynamics CRM 2011 can be opened in  
application mode
Outlook
Sets the options for synchronization of Dynamics CRM 2011 with Outlook
Reporting
Specifies the report categories
Goals
Sets the roll-up frequency and expiry time
In this recipe we will ind out how to modify the default settings and will dive deep into a few 
very important settings.
How to do it…
The following steps tell you how to carry out the changes in the System Settings section:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as the system administrator or an 
equivalent role.
2. Navigate to the Settings | Administration | System Settings section. Double-click to 
launch the System Settings dialog.
3. After the settings are modiied, click on the OK button to save the modiied settings 
and close the dialog.

How it works…
The System Settings section contains a few very important conigurations regarding the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Let's see what they are.
The General setting has the following options:
 
f
Show Get Started panes on all lists for all users: This setting determines whether or 
not to display the Get Started pane.
 
f
Enable presence for the system: This setting determines whether instant messaging 
will display the current status for users, contacts, opportunities, or leads.
 
f
Name Format: This setting determines the format in which the full name of the users 
and contacts will be displayed in the system. Changing the name format does not 
affect the existing entries. It only affects the new entries to be added post Name 
Format change.
 
f
Pricing Decimal Precision: This setting determines how many decimal points to use 
for currency.
 
f
Share reassigned records with the original owner: Select whether or not a  
record is shared with the original owner of the record or is completely reassigned  
to another user.
 
f
Set blocked ile extensions for attachments: Prevent users from attaching iles with 
speciic ile name extensions.
 
f
Display currency by using: Select how currency is to be displayed.
 
f
Enable Quick Find records limit: Update Rollup 10 of Dynamics CRM 2011 has 
introduced Quick Find Optimization. By default, this setting is enabled but can be 
disabled using the UI option. If Quick Find Optimization is enabled, any quick ind 
query returning more than 10,000 records will result in the following error:
Quick ind limit exceeded. Please use a more selective search value, or use 
Advanced Find for your search
Disabling this setting will result in slow performance of quick ind queries.
The Calendar setting will have the following options:
 
f
Maximum duration of an appointment in days: Sets the maximum duration for an 
appointment record
The Formats setting will have the following options:
 
f
Format: This setting determines the language and locale that corresponds to the 
format that we want to use as the default format for the organization. If you want to 
customize number, currency, time, and date formats for the organization, click on 
Customize and modify the default formats, and then click on OK to save the values.


Which of these locations the access originates from: Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM 2011 web application, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for Outlook,  
or SDK calls to the web services
Auditing is discussed in detail in the next chapter under the Enabling Auditing recipe.
The E-mail setting will have the following options:
 
f
Conigure Email Processing: Select this option to prevent Dynamics CRM 2011 
e-mail router from processing unapproved email addresses.
 
f
User Tracking Token: Select the checkbox to use tracking tokens and to conigure 
how Dynamics CRM 2011 will display the subject line of an e-mail message. Use 
tracking tokens to more accurately determine if a new record is related to an existing, 
tracked record. When we change the e-mail preix, up to 256 characters are saved as 
history. Long preixes or too many preix changes may cause lost data in history.
 
f
Set tracking options for e-mails between CRM users: This option determines 
whether to create two e-mail activities between Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011  
users, one for the sender and one for the recipient.
 
f
Set E-mail form options: Select these options for e-mail forms.
 
f
Set ile size limit for attachments: Using this option, increase or decrease the 
allowed size of iles that can be attached to records. The ile size limit that we specify 
for attachments also limits the size of web resources that can be uploaded in the 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 systems.
The Marketing setting will have the following options:
 
f
Enable Direct E-mail via Mail Merge: This option enables users to send e-mail 
messages as a campaign activity using the mail merge feature. To enable this option, 
the security role (a deined set of privileges) assigned to users for whom we want 
to enable mail merge must also include the mail merge privilege. The security role 
assigned to a user determines which tasks the user can perform and which parts of 
the user interface the user can view. All users must be assigned at least one security 
role in order to access the system.
 
f
Create campaign responses for incoming e-mail: This option enables the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 system to create a campaign response automatically when an e-mail 
message is received in response to a speciic marketing campaign.

Chapter 3

f
Set the auto-unsubscribe options: This setting deines how to handle accounts, 
contacts, or leads who do not want to receive marketing communications.
The Customization setting will have the following options:
 
f
Application Mode: Enables the user to set whether Dynamics CRM 2011 can be 
opened in a browser window without menu, navigation, and command bars. Once 
we enable application mode, there is little difference in using the URL. To launch 
Dynamics CRM 2011 in Application Mode after enabling this setting, we need to use 
the http://servername:portnumber/orgname URL format.
 
f
Form Mode: Form mode deines different presentations of the form of an entity. We 
can choose from the following alternatives:
 

Edit: This is the default From Mode option. In this mode, the form can 
behave in different ways depending on the state of the record, user 
permissions, and the action that is being performed. The Edit mode also has 
a subtype called read only, which is used when a user does not have access 
to modify the data in the form. The read-only form is just an Edit form with 
disabled fields.
 

Read-Optimized: This mode of the form is optimized to load the data quickly. 
The Read-Optimized option shortens the time required to load a form by 
stripping the form down to its bare essentials. This type of form:
Displays all ields, notes, IFrames, and subgrids that are visible by default
Honors all form- and ield-level security conigurations
Does not display the ribbon or allow editing a record
Does not display form navigation
Does not display embedded web resources
Does not execute form scripts
The Outlook setting will have the following options:
 
f
E-mail promotion options: Determines whether incoming e-mails have to be tracked 
and the tracking frequency.
 

Perform checks as new e-mail is received: Determines whether incoming 
e-mails have to be tracked. If it is set to yes, the following two options drive 
the frequency of the tracking.
 

Promote incoming e-mail every: Determines how often the incoming e-mails 
are polled or reviewed.

Coniguring iscal-year settings
Fiscal year settings are organizational settings that can be modiied to suit organizational 
needs. These settings can be modiied any time in an organization.
How to do it…
Please perform the following steps to conigure the iscal year settings in the CRM system:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system with the system administrator or an 
equivalent role.
2. Navigate to the Settings | Business Management | Fiscal Year Settings section. 
Double-click to launch the Fiscal Year Settings dialog.
3. In the Fiscal Year Settings web pop up, modify a setting and then click on OK to save 
the setting and close the pop up.
How it works…
The iscal year options affect the way in which an organization's data is stored in the Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 database. Therefore, we can set the iscal year options only once. We 
cannot change these settings after we have set them.

Chapter 3

The iscal period and display-related settings are available to conigure here.
 
f
Start Date: Determines the start date of the iscal year.
 
f
Fiscal Period Template: The template for how the iscal year is divided. Possible 
options are Annually, Semiannually, Quarterly, Monthly, and 4-Week period. Once 
the start date and period type are deined, the system can calculate the start and 
end dates of iscal periods for various iscal years.
There are other display options to be conigured as shown in the following screenshot:

Data Management
Data management is a very important feature for any CRM system. No matter how lexible 
and feature rich the system is, unless there is relevant data within the CRM system the end 
users will not ind it useful. Data import and export functionality along with duplicate detection 
and audit management are a signiicant part of data management in the Dynamics CRM 
2011 system. In this chapter, we will discuss the main pillars of data management inside 
the Dynamics CRM 2011 system: Import Data Wizard, Bulk Deletion Wizard, duplicate 
detection, and Audit management.
The following recipes will be discussed in this chapter in detail:

Introduction to data import
Data can be imported in two ways within Dynamics CRM 2011 system. These are explained  
as follows:
Using Import Wizard: Dynamics CRM 2011 provides Import Data Wizard for quick and easy 
data import. Import Data Wizard can import data from any of the following supported ile types:
 
f
XML Spreadsheet 2003 (XMLSS) ile (.xml) format
 
f
CSV

Data Management
160
 
f
TXT with columns separated by commas
 
f
ZIP (A .zip ile can include multiple iles of the .csv, .xml, or .txt formats. All iles 
in a single compressed ile must be of the same format)
Each ile's size can be up to 8 MB and if multiple iles are zipped together 
then the size limit goes up to 32 MB of data when Data Import Wizard is used. 
For zipped iles, the total size of the extracted iles must not exceed 200 MB. 
The zipped iles get unzipped in the Dynamics CRM 2011 server before import 
and hence each individual extracted ile size cannot exceed 8 MB as well.
This import ile size is stored in the ImportMaxAllowedFileSizeInMB column of the 
ServerSettingsProperties table of the MSCRM_CONFIG database. It is not supported 
to update this value in the database. It is also not recommended to increase this size limit, 
because sending a large ile to Dynamics CRM 2011 Server for upload may clog bandwidth as 
well as increase load on the asynchronous service. Other asynchronous operations waiting for 
asynchronous service will starve and might result in errors.
When importing a .zip ile, all iles contained in the .zip ile must use the same ield  
and data delimiters. It is not supported to import non-printable characters such as carriage 
returns and line feeds and these must be stripped out of things like any description text 
before importing.
Import Data Wizard uses an XML ile, called Data Map, to associate the data to be imported 
with correct entities and attributes within the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Dynamics CRM 
2011 offers a list of data maps out of the box. These data maps can be used during data 
import via Import Wizard. New data maps can be created to facilitate the data import  
process as well.
Using Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK: Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK provides programmatic ways of 
importing data into the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Large volumes of data, especially from 
legacy systems, are imported into Dynamics CRM 2011 in a programmatic way.
Importing data into Dynamics CRM 2011 
with Import Data Wizard
In this recipe, we will discuss how to import data using Import Wizard. During the data import 
process we will also create a custom data map and use it during the import process.

Chapter 4
161
How to do it…
Please perform the following steps to import data within the Dynamics CRM 2011 system:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system with system administrator or relevant  
security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | System | Data Management | Imports or alternatively to 
Workplace | My Work | Imports.
3. Click on the Import Data button in the top ribbon.
4. In the Upload Data File web pop-up, browse to a ile that we intend to upload using 
the new data map to be created. After selecting the ile, click on Next to proceed.
5. In the Review File Upload Summary page expand the Delimiter Settings section and 
verify the following delimiter settings before clicking on Next to continue:
 

Field delimiter: This delimiter is used to separate fields in the import file. 
The possible delimiters are Comma (,), Colon (:), Semicolon (;), and Tab (\t).
 

Data delimiter: This delimiter is used to keep the field value intact in case 
the field delimiter character itself is used as part of the field value. The 
possible delimiters are Quotation Mark ("), Single Quotation Mark ('),  
and None.
 

First row contains column headings: Tick this checkbox if the first row in 
the data file contains the field names or column headings.

Data Management
162
Then the Select Data Map page appears. Some generic data maps are already  
made available by the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. The following table describes  
the generic data maps and when to use them as well:
Data map name
When to use
Default (Automatic 
Mapping)
Use this data map to let Import Data Wizard 
automatically map the files and columns. The import 
wizard will allow us to map any fields it doesn't 
automatically resolve in further steps.
Generic Map for Contact 
and Account
Choose when the source files contain records for Contact 
and Account entities where Contact is the primary  
record type.
For Full Data Export
Select this data map if the source data is exported using 
the Full Data Export feature of Salesforce.
com.
For Report Export
Select this data map if the source data is exported using 
the Report Export feature of Salesforce.com.
For Contact and Account 
Report Export
Select this data map when the source files contain 
records for Contact and Account entity exported from 
Salesforce.com where Contact is the primary record 
type.
Microsoft Outlook 
Business Contact 
Manager 2010 Map
Select this data map where the source files contain 
data obtained from Microsoft Outlook Business Contact 
Manager 2010.
Alternatively, we also can choose from a custom data map if available. Finally, click 
on Next to proceed.
6. If the Map Record Types page appears, select the correct entity name from the drop-
down list under Microsoft Dynamics CRM Record Types header.
Here, the Source Data Files column shows a list of the source iles and the Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM Record Types column shows a Dynamics CRM 2011 record type as 
a possible match for each of the source iles listed in the Source Data Files column. 
The suggested type can be ignored and a different record type can be selected.
Import Data Wizard can automatically map the files, if the source 
filename and the display name of the Dynamics CRM 2011 record 
type to which we want to import the data match exactly.
If we select Ignore in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Record Types column, the 
Import Wizard will ignore this ile during data import.

Chapter 4
163
If we want to create a new custom entity in the system during data import, navigate 
to Actions | Create New under Microsoft Dynamics CRM Record Types. We can 
mention the entity name, its plural name, and the primary ield name here.
If the entity name specified already exists, Dynamics CRM 2011 will 
prompt again to specify a new name.
Also, importing a user can create a new record type only if the user 
has the privileges to create and publish custom record types in the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
Then click on Next to proceed.
7. 
In the Map Fields page, create the source ields to target ields mapping for those 
ields marked as Not Mapped under both Source Fields and Target Fields.
 

Option Sets: If we choose to map a column of the source file with an Option 
Set type field, the Import Wizard will allow us to map with the values present 
in the import file with the Option Set values.
If the import data ile contains a value for an Option Set column that is not part of 
the Option Set values, we can add the new values to the Option Set using the Import 
Wizard. Import Wizard, thus can create up to 400 Option Set values.
 

Lookups: If we choose to map a column of the source file with a Lookup  
type field, the Import Wizard will allow us to map with the correct  
relationship type.

Data Management
164
 

Custom field: If data file contains columns for which there exists no 
matching field in the entity, then we can create a new field by choosing 
Create New Field during mapping. We can specify the name and data type 
of the field. The following screenshot is an example of a custom Option Set to 
be created during data import:
The newly created attribute does not get automatically added to 
the entity forms or any other views. Moreover, additional field-
level settings such as Requirement Level, Searchable, Field 
Security, and Auditing would be set to the default value of the 
respective fields. In case the custom column header exceeds 
160 characters, then Import Wizard fails to create the new 
custom field within Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
Then click on Next to continue.
8. In the Review Mapping Summary page, click on the Next button to continue.
9. In the Review Settings and Import Data page, select the following options  
before proceeding:
 

Allow Duplicates: Select whether or not to allow duplicate records during 
data import. The duplicate records will be determined based on the duplicate 
detection settings. If the Allow Duplicate setting is set to Yes, the system will 
not allow duplicate entries to be inserted.
 

Select Owner for Imported Records: Select a user or team who will be 
owning the imported records in the system. By default, the current user  
is selected.
 

Data Map Name (optional): Optionally enter a data map name under the 
Data Map Name (optional) section. If this is not entered, the data map 
would not be saved for future use. The logged in user must have create 
privilege on the Data Map entity if a custom data map is to be created.

Chapter 4
165
Then click on the Submit button.
10. In the Data Submitted for Import page, click on the Finish button to close the wizard.
11. Once the Data Import Wizard closes, navigate to Settings | System | Data 
Management | Imports or alternatively to Workplace | My Work | Imports.  
The current import ile should be present under the My Imports view.
12. Check the value of the Status Reason column for the imported ile. A periodic  
refresh is required to view the current status reason as the data grid does  
not refresh automatically. The import is considered successful if Status  
Reason shows Completed.
13. To check more details (failures and so on) open the Import Job window by double-
clicking on the job name.

Data Management
166
14. Then navigate to Settings | Data Management | Data Maps.
15. The created data map should be visible in the list.
16. This data map can then also be exported using the Export button in the data map's 
tool bar.
How it works…
To run the data import, a set of asynchronous jobs run in the background. The Status Reason 
value of the data import ile corresponds to these jobs. The following are the possible values 
for Status Reason:
Status Reason
Definition
Submitted
The file is submitted for import.
Parsing
Submits an asynchronous job to parse all the import files associated with a 
particular import.
Transforming
Submits an asynchronous job to modify the parsed data by applying all the 
transformations mappings associated with the data import.
Importing
After successful completion of the transformation, the data is uploaded into 
the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
Completed
If the import is successful, the status is displayed as Completed.
Failed
If the import is unsuccessful, the status is displayed as Failed. A failure 
can occur in any of the data import stages, that is, parsing, transforming, or 
uploading.
For any reason, if we want to roll back the import we can achieve this within the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 system. We can remove the imported records by deleting the imported job that 
has created the records. Navigate to Settings | System | Data Management | Imports, then 
select the imported job, and click on the Delete button in the top ribbon. The Delete button 
allows the user to select from the following three options:
 
f
Delete the Import Source File: This removes the uploaded import job along with the 
source ile and mapping information, but not the imported data.
 
f
All Records Imported to this Entity During this Import: This will remove all records 
imported during a data import.
This is an entity level rollback feature. During import, if a .zip ile having multiple 
individual iles (for example, Lead1.csv and Lead2.csv) for a speciic entity (Lead) 
has been used, then selecting this deletion option even for one of these iles (say 
Lead1.csv) will actually delete all successfully imported records of the entity (Lead) 
from all the import iles (both Lead1.csv and Lead2.csv) contained within the 
.zip ile. But records of other entities contained within the same .zip ile would  
not be deleted.

Chapter 4
167
 
f
All Imported Records from the .zip File: This will remove all records that were 
imported from a .zip ile during an import.
A data map is a complex XML ile used for mapping source data with Dynamics CRM 2011 
entities and ields. In this recipe, we have discussed generic data maps and how to create a 
custom data map using Import Wizard.
But in some scenarios data transformation is complex and data maps are required to be 
edited manually to include the transformation mappings and then import the data map in 
the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. A data map can be exported from the Dynamics CRM 2011 
system, edited in any XML editor, and then imported back into Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
To export a data map, navigate to Settings | System | Data Management | Data Maps and 
then select the data map and click on the Export button in the toolbar.
Data transformation mappings help to modify the data on the ly before importing into the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 system. The transformed data must be compatible with the entity 
attribute type and precision. The following table lists the available transformation mappings in 
Dynamics CRM 2011 system:
Field
Value
Description
AddToCurrentDate
Microsoft.Crm.Transformations.
AddToCurrentDate
Adds a specified number of days, months, 
and years to the current date and sets the 
specified date.
AddToDate

AddToDate
Adds a specified number of days, months, 
and years to a date.
AdvancedAddToCurrentDate
Microsoft.Crm.Transformations.
AdvancedAddToCurrentDate
Adds a specified number of days, months, 
and years to the current date. It can also be 
specified whether offsets are relative to the 
current date or absolute values. The offsets 
can only be integer numbers.
AssignValue
Microsoft.Crm.Transformations.
AssignValue
Replaces all values with a specified value.
Concatenate
Microsoft.Crm.Transformations.
Concatenate
Concatenates strings and separates them 
with a delimiter.
Replace
Microsoft.Crm.Transformations.

into substrings. There can be up to 10 
substrings.
Substring
Microsoft.Crm.Transformations.
Substring
Returns a substring of a specified length, 
starting at a specified point in the string.

While importing a data map XML ile in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system, the system validates 
the following properties of the data map ile:
 
f
Uniqueness of the data map ilename
 
f
Data map XML is well formed
The XML deinition of the data map can be found in the following location: 
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\CRMWeb\_
Resources\ImportMapSchema.xsd.
The fundamental differences between creating a data map using Import Data Wizard and 
manually editing a data map are as follows:
Task

Manual editing of data map
Map existing files, columns, and 
users.
All mapping will be

Import Data Wizard 
can customize the 
system
Data map will not be imported if 
target record type and attribute 
names do not exist in Dynamics 
CRM 2011.
Use transformations (Types 
of mappings used to modify 
data before migrating it. 
Transformations include 
concatenation, split, replace, 
substring, assignment, and date 
modifications.)
No
Yes
Use the display name for target 
record types and fields.
Yes
No. Uses the logical name instead. 
(The logical name is the name that 
is used in the Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM Online database schema. To 
identify schema names for record 
types and attributes, use the 
Customization area of Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM Online.) 
Manually edited data maps can be imported into the system by following the ensuing steps:
1. Navigate to Settings | System | Data Management | Data Maps.
2. On the Actions menu, click on Import.
3. In the Select File to Import dialog box, click on Browse, locate the ile, and then click 
on OK.

Chapter 4
169
There's more...
In this recipe, we have discussed how to import data of a speciic record type using a data 
map. Dynamics CRM 2011 also supports importing a single data ile into multiple entities. For 
example, a single CSV ile having data for both Lead and Competitor entities as shown in the 
following table:
Lead record fields
Competitor record fields
Topic
First 
name
Last 
name
Company 
name
E-mail
Phone
Competitor 
name
Key product
Website
Ticker 
symbol
If we want to import data for multiple entities using one data map, we have to create a data 
map capable of mapping data to multiple entities. We can create a multi-entity data map 
using any XML editor. The following code snippet is an example of such a data map:
<Map Name="Lead and Competitor Data Maps" Source="Import">
  <Description> Lead and Competitor Data maps</Description>
  <EntitiesPerFile>Multiple</EntitiesPerFile>
  <EntityMaps>
    <EntityMap TargetEntityName="lead" 
               SourceEntityName="Lead" 
               Dedupe="Ignore" 
               ProcessCode="Process">
    </EntityMap>
    <EntityMap TargetEntityName="competitor" 
               SourceEntityName="Competitor" 
               Dedupe="Eliminate" 
               ProcessCode="Process">
    </EntityMap>
  </EntityMaps>
</Map>
Then this custom data map has to be imported in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Navigate 
to Settings | System | Data Management | Data Maps. On the Actions menu, click on 
Import. In the Import Data Map dialog box, click on Browse, locate the multi-entity Map XML 
ile, and then click on OK.
Thereafter, start the data ile import process. Select the newly imported custom multi-entity 
data map during the data import. In the Map Fields page, all the entities will be listed under 
CRM Record Types. Map the entity record ields with correct column headers from  
the import ile.

Data Management
170
Use Ignore for those ields in the source ile that should not be linked 
with a ield of a speciic entity.
The Review Mapping Summary page will also list multiple iles, one for each entity.
Exporting Dynamics CRM 2011 data to 
Microsoft Excel
Dynamics CRM 2011 allows you to export Dynamics CRM data using the Microsoft Excel tool. 
In this recipe, we will discuss how to export data from the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Please follow the ensuing steps to export data from the Dynamics CRM 2011 system to  
Microsoft Excel:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user with rights to export data.
2. Navigate to System View or Saved View or Advanced Find View of an entity from 
which data has to be exported.
3. Then click on the Export to Excel button in the ribbon.

Chapter 4
171
4. This will bring up the Export Data to Excel web pop-up. Select in what type of Excel 
worksheet the data is to be exported from the following options:
 

Static worksheet with records from this page
 

Static worksheet with records from all pages in the current view (this 
option is not available in Advanced Find View)
 

Dynamics PivotTable
 

Dynamics worksheet
If the Static Worksheet option has been selected then we can tick the 
Mark this data available for re-importing by including required column 
headings option as well. This option is useful when we intend to modify 
the exported data and want to re-import to Dynamics CRM 2011 later.
5. Finally click on the Export button to export and save the data.
How it works…
If the Dynamic PivotTable worksheet type is selected, we can specify which ields from the 
entity we want to export. By default, the ields used in the current view will be selected. But 
we can modify the column selection by clicking on the Select Columns button, which will be 
enabled once the Dynamic PivotTable option is selected. We need to use Microsoft Excel 
2007 or higher versions to export a list to a PivotTable.
If the Dynamic worksheet option is selected, we can specify which ields from the entity we 
want to export. By default, the ields used in the current view will be selected. But we can 
modify the column selection by clicking on the Edit Columns button, which will be enabled 
once the Dynamic worksheet option is selected. In addition, we can also select the sorting 
order of the exported records.
If we only want to export the data displayed in the current page, select the Static worksheet 
with records from this page option and in case we intend to export all the records from 
the current view, then select Static worksheet with records from all pages in the current 
view. Data exported to static worksheets can be modiied in Microsoft Excel and can be 
re-imported back into the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. If we intend to do this, we have to 
select the Mark this data available for re-importing by including required column headings 
option during export. But if we have selected this setting during data export, there are certain 
considerations for data modiication before re-importing it:
 
f
Deleting a row does not delete the corresponding record in Dynamics CRM 2011  
after re-import
 
f
We cannot modify or specify values for those ields that have a value Not Valid for 
Update such as the Created By ield

Data Management
172
 
f
Value for Full Name attribute should be entered following the Name Format setting 
under System Settings of the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
 
f
The Party List type ields are not supported for data import.
 
f
If the entity has more than one ield with the same display name and the  
exported Excel worksheet contains one or more of these ields, this Excel  
cannot be re-imported.
 
f
Field data cannot be modiied or inserted if ield-level security does not permit the 
logged-in user.
The Money ield's value is exported to Microsoft Excel as numbers, not as currency. Such ield 
values can be converted to currency using Microsoft Excel features.
There's more...
By default, Microsoft Dynamics CRM allows you to export a list of 10,000 records 
at a time to a static (a ile that does not change when data changes in Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM Online) Excel worksheet. This limit can be increased by updating the 
MaxRecordsForExportToExcel attribute in organization database. This can be done  
by using the following CRM SDK call:
Organization organization = new Organization();
organization.Id = orgId; //GUID of the Organization
organization.MaxRecordsForExportToExcel = 50000; //Increases the limit 
to 50,000
service.Update(organization);
This value is stored in the MaxRecordsForExportToExcel column in the 
OrganizationBase table of the <OrganizationName>_MSCRM database.  
But updating the value in the database directly is unsupported.
It is not recommended to update these settings to a very high value as this can peg the  
server resources.
Cleaning data using Bulk Deletion Wizard
Bulk record deletion is a very useful feature in Dynamics CRM 2011. Using this feature, 
unwanted or stale records can be deleted in bulk. In this recipe, we will delve into how  
to bulk delete records in Dynamics CRM 2011.
How to do it…
Please follow the ensuing steps to bulk delete data from Dynamics CRM 2011 system:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user having bulk delete permission.

Chapter 4
173
2. Navigate to the entity (whose records have to be deleted) by clicking on the entity link 
in the navigation pane.
3. On the top ribbon, click on Delete and then select the Bulk Delete option.
4. Bulk Deletion Wizard will pop-up. On the Deine Search Criteria page, deine the 
criteria based on which data has to be retrieved for bulk deletion.
5. Post the search query formation, then click on the Preview Records button to preview 
the records satisfying the search criteria. If we want to modify the query criteria, we 
can click on Back to Query to modify the query and then once again preview the 
records to be deleted.
6. Thereafter, click on the Next button. The selected Options page appears. On this 
page, provide the following details:
 

Name is the name for the bulk deletion job
 

Bulk deletion job start time is the bulk deletion job start time
 

Run this job after every allows you to choose whether this job needs to 
occur once or on a recurring basis


Option to have an e-mail sent to the current user as well as other users when 
the job is completed
7. 
Then click on the Next button. The Review Bulk Deletion Details page will appear. 
Click on Submit to submit the bulk deletion job.
8. To check the status of the job, navigate to Settings | Data Management | Bulk 
Record Deletion.
9. In the All Bulk Deletion System Jobs view, we should be able to ind the bulk deletion 
job submitted.
10. Once the Status Reason of the job is displayed as Succeeded, the records are 
deleted from the system.
11. We can double-click and open the job details to ind any failures during deletion.
How it works…
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 provides bulk data deletion feature, which can be used to 
clean the following data to manage system storage and maintain data quality:
 
f
Stale data
 
f
Sample or test data
 
f
Data incorrectly imported into the system

Chapter 4
175
If a bulk delete job fails or ends prematurely, any records that were deleted before the failure 
or ending of the job will not be rolled back and remain deleted. Bulk delete job deletes the 
records according to cascading rules based on the relationships between entities in the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
If a worklow or plug-in is conigured to be triggered when an entity record is deleted, such 
worklows or plug-ins will trigger when the entity record is deleted by the bulk delete job.
Creating duplicate detection rules
In Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011, duplicate detection allows us to set duplicate detection 
policies and detect duplicate records. These rules can be applied across different record 
types. For example, we can deine a duplicate detection rule that a lead is a duplicate of a 
contact, if they have the same name and e-mail. Duplicate detection is possible only when 
duplicate detection rules exist in the system. To maintain data quality duplicate detection 
is very important for the Dynamics CRM 2011 system and in this recipe we will delve into 
creation steps of the duplicate detection rule.
How to do it…
Please follow the ensuing steps to create duplication detection rules in the Dynamics CRM 
2011 system:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user having access rights to create 
duplicate detection rules.
2. Navigate to Settings | System | Data Management | Duplication Detection Rules.
3. Click on the New button in the Actions menu. The Duplicate Detection Rule: New 
page appears. Please provide the appropriate values for the Name and Description 
ields for the duplicate detection rule.
Then we have to provide the value for Duplicate Detection Rule Criteria. Select the 
value Base Record Type (the entity to which this rule applies) and Matching Record 
Type (the entity records to which the base record type will be matched).
If we do not want the duplicate detection rule to be applied to inactive records, check 
the Exclude inactive matching records box. Similarly check the Case-sensitive box if 
the rule needs to be case sensitive.

Data Management
176
Finally, we have to deine the duplicate detection rule. Check the Ignore Blank Values 
box if we do not want the rule to detect blank ields (null values) as equal while 
identifying duplicates.
4. Then click on the Save and Close button in the top ribbon to save and close the 
duplicate detection rule.
5. Then in the All Duplicate Detection Rules view, select the duplicate detection rule 
created and click on Publish in the Actions menu.
6. In the Publish Rule web pop-up, click on the OK button. This activity will publish the 
duplicate detection rule created. The value for Status Reason of this rule will be 
updated to Published. This conirms that the duplicate detection rule is published in 
the system.
How it works…
Duplicate detection rules allow organizations to set duplicate detection policies for various 
entity records. Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 uses duplicate detection rules to determine 
whether a record is a potential duplicate or not. Duplicate detection rule can be created for 
an entity if the entity allows a duplicate detection rule to be set. To check this navigate to the 
entity's General settings page in the Customizations section and check whether Duplicate 
detection is selected or not.

Chapter 4
177
Multiple duplicate detection rules, with a maximum limit of ive, can be 
created per base record type.
A duplicate detection rule will ignore null values, whether or not Ignore Null Values is 
selected, if the duplicate detection rule contains only one condition. That is, null values  
in the selected ields will not be considered equal during duplicate detection.
A duplicate detection rule can have one or more conditions and these 
conditions are combined by the system in logical AND operation.
The number of criteria that we can select is limited by the number of characters that can 
be stored in the matchcode for the record. A matchcode is created for every record that a 
duplicate detection rule might apply to, used as part of the process of detecting duplicates. 
Check the Current matchcode length value shown at the bottom-left of the duplicate 
detection rule area.
After the publishing of the duplicate detection rule, if we increase the length 
of the ields used in the duplicate detection rule, the matchcode goes 
undetected. The ield length could exceed the matchcode length limit and 
not be veriied. This may result in duplicates not being detected. Hence if the 
length of any ield, which is used in duplicate detection criteria, needs to be 
increased, good practice is to Unpublish the duplicate detection rule and  
re-publish it again.
Two types of duplicate detection rules can be set up in Dynamics CRM 2011 system:
 
f
Single entity duplicate detection rule: In this type, duplicate detection criteria are 
deined within a single entity. For example, account records are duplicates of each 
other if they have the same account name, post code, and SIC code.
 
f
Cross entity duplicate detection rule: In this type, duplicate detection criteria are 
deined across two entities. For example, contact records are duplicate to lead 
records if they have the same irst name, last name, post code, and e-mail address.

Data Management
178
If an entity's metadata changes, all duplicate detection rules associated with 
the entity will be automatically unpublished. Hence, every time there is a 
change in the entity metadata when a new solution is imported, we have to 
re-publish the duplicate detection rules for that entity.
Duplicate Detection Settings determine whether and when duplicates will be detected in the 
system. To set the system-wide duplicate detection settings, navigate to Settings | System 
| Data Management | Duplicate Detection Settings. Double-click to launch the Duplicate 
Detection Settings web pop-up. Here we can enable duplicate detection in the system and 
also decide when duplicates will be detected.
The following are the effective system-wide duplicate detection settings:
 
f
When a record is created or updated: Duplicates will be detected if records are 
created or updated from the Dynamics CRM 2011 Web UI or Dynamics CRM 2011 
for Outlook client. Dynamics CRM 2011 prompts the user before saving or importing 
potential duplicate records.
Duplicates cannot be detected when a user merges two records, converts a lead, 
or saves activities as completed. Duplicate detection is also not available when the 
status of a record changes such as with activation and deactivation of a record.
 
f
When Microsoft Dynamics CRM for Outlook goes from ofline to online: Duplicates 
will be detected if Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for Outlook is going from ofline 
mode to online mode.
 
f
During data import: Duplicates can be detected when data is imported using the 
Import Data Wizard.

Chapter 4
179
However, if data is entered or modiied using Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK, by default 
the Dynamics CRM 2011 system will not detect duplicates in the system. The 
duplicate detection rules have to be manually invoked using the following code:
// create operation by using duplicate detection 
CreateRequest createRequest = new CreateRequest();
createRequest.Target = contact;
// Duplicate detection is activated.            
createRequest.Parameters.Add("SuppressDuplicateDetection", false); 
// Update operation by using duplicate detection 
UpdateRequest updateRequest = new UpdateRequest();
updateRequest.Target = retrievedAccount;
// Duplicate detection is activated.
updateRequest["SuppressDuplicateDetection"] = false; 
There's more...
As duplicate detection rules cannot be exported as part of the managed or unmanaged 
solution and even cannot be exported like data export, duplicate detection rules can only be 
migrated from one organization to another using manual creation activity or creating them 
programmatically using Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK.
If there are quite a large number of duplicate detection rules to be migrated from development 
to test to production environment, programmatic creation of a duplicate detection rule is a 
better alternative. With this approach, the rule creation can be repeated every time with new 
organizations with not much manual activity:
//Create Duplicate Detection Rule
DuplicateRule duplicateRule = new DuplicateRule();
duplicateRule.BaseEntityName = "account";
duplicateRule.MatchingEntityName = "account";
duplicateRule.Name = "Accounts having same Account Number";
duplicateRule.IsCaseSensitive = true;
duplicateRule.ExcludeInactiveRecords = true;
//Create Duplicate Rule Conditions
DuplicateRuleCondition duplicateRuleCondition = new 
                    DuplicateRuleCondition();
duplicateRuleCondition.OperatorCode = new
 Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.OptionSetValue(0);
duplicateRuleCondition.IgnoreBlankValues = true;

Data Management
180
duplicateRuleCondition.BaseAttributeName = "accountnumber";
duplicateRuleCondition.MatchingAttributeName = "accountnumber";
DuplicateRuleCondition.OperatorParam = null;
DuplicateRuleCondition[] duplicateRuleConditions = new 
DuplicateRuleCondition[] {duplicateRuleCondition };
//Create Duplicate Detection Rule with conditions in one go
TargetCompoundDuplicateRule target = new 
                    TargetCompoundDuplicateRule();
target.DuplicateRule = duplicateRule;
target.DuplicateRuleConditions = duplicateRuleConditions;
CompoundCreateRequest request = new CompoundCreateRequest();
request.Target = target;
CompoundCreateResponse response = (CompoundCreateResponse)crmService.
Execute(request);
Scheduling duplicate detection jobs
In the previous recipe, we discussed how to create duplicate detection rules. After creating 
these rules, we can periodically detect duplicates in the system and take corrective action for 
maintaining data quality in the system. In this recipe, we will delve into the creation of periodic 
duplicate detection jobs in Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to conigure duplicate detection jobs:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user having relevant permission.
2. Navigate to Settings | System | Data Management | Duplicate Detection Jobs or 
to Workplace | My Work | Duplicate Detection.
3. Click on the New button in the Actions menu.
4. The Welcome to the Duplicate Detection Wizard page will launch. Click on Next  
to proceed.
5. In the Select Records page, select the entity against which the duplicate detection 
job has to be conigured from the Look for drop-down list. Entities against which 
duplicate detection rules are published will only be listed in the drop-down list. Then, 
select an existing view from the Use Saved View list or create an Advanced Find 
View. Then click on Next to proceed.

Chapter 4
181
6. In the Select Options page, provide the following details and then click on Next  
to continue:
 

Name is the name for the duplicate detection job
 

Start time is the duplicate detection job start time
 

Run this job after every allows you to choose whether this job needs to 
occur one time or on a recurring basis
 

Option to have an e-mail sent to the current user as well as other users when 
the job is completed
7. 
In the Start Duplicate Detection Job page, click on Submit to submit the job. This 
will also close the wizard.

Data Management
182
8. Then we can ind the duplicate detection job listed in the My Duplicate Detection 
Jobs view.
9. Double-click on the duplicate detection job to open the job details. We can ind the 
duplicates by navigating to Related | Common | View Duplicates view.
10. The preceding list displays all records that have potential duplicates. When we select 
a record in the preceding list, the following list shows all the potential duplicates for 
that record.
11. For each record in the bottom list we can take the following actions:
 

Deactivate the record: Navigate to More Actions | Deactivate from the 
Actions menu.
 

Merge the record:
Navigate to Merge | Automatically from the Actions toolbar. This will merge the 
records selecting the top record as Master record.
Navigate to Merge | Select Master from the Actions toolbar. This allows us to 
choose the master record and the subordinate records are deactivated.
 

Delete the record: Select Delete from the Actions toolbar.

Chapter 4
183
How it works…
Duplicate detection jobs can run periodically to identify duplicates in the system. Once 
potential duplicates are identiied, the corrective actions such as de-activating the duplicate, 
merging the duplicate, or even deleting the duplicate can be taken.
Enabling auditing in the Dynamics CRM 2011 
system
Auditing is a very important feature offered by Dynamics CRM 2011. Auditing helps 
administrators to igure how the system is being used. In this recipe, we will discuss  
how to enable auditing inside the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to enable Global Audit settings:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a user having rights to view  
audit summary.
2. Navigate to Settings | System | Administration | System Settings | Audit.
Select the following options:
 

Select the Start Auditing checkbox to enable auditing at the system level
 

Select the Audit user access checkbox to start user access auditing. 
Auditing user access captures the following information only:
When the user has logged in
Where the access originated—from the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 web 
application, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for Outlook, or SDK calls to the  
web services.
 

Select Common Entities to start auditing for common entities around Sales, 
Marketing, and Services module. These entities include Account, Contact, 
Lead, Product, Sales Literature, Marketing List, Quick Campaign, Goal, Goal 
Metric, and Rollup Query.
 

Select Sales Entities to start auditing for the Sales module-related entities. 
These entities include Opportunity, Order, Competitor, Quote, and Invoice.
 

Select Marketing Entities to start auditing for Marketing module-related 
entities. These entities include Campaign.

Data Management
184
 

Select Customer Service Entities to start auditing for Customer Service 
module-related entities. These entities include Case, Service, and Contract.
3. Then click on OK to save and close the settings.
After enabling auditing at the global level, the next step would be to enable auditing at entity 
and ield level. Follow the next steps to enable entity- and ield-level auditing:
1. Navigate to Settings | System | Auditing | Entity and Field Level Settings. This will 
bring up the Default Solution web dialog.
Alternatively, we can select an unmanaged solution by navigating to Settings | 
Customization | Solutions and then double-clicking to open the speciic solution  
web dialog.

Chapter 4
185
2. Now extend the Entities section and then click on the entity for which auditing has to 
be enabled. Then select the Auditing option under the Data Services header.
3. To enable ield-level auditing, extend the Entity section and then select Fields. This 
will display all the ields of the entity. Then select the ield against which auditing has 
to be enabled and double-click to open its properties.

Data Management
186
4. Now select Enable against Auditing and then select Save and Close from the top to 
close the dialog.
5. Finally publish the entity to publish the auditing changes. To publish the changes, 
click on the entity name again and then select the Publish button from the top menu.
How it works…
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 supports an auditing capability where entity and attribute data 
changes within an organization can be recorded over time for use in analysis and reporting 
purposes. Auditing is supported on all custom and most customizable entities and attributes. 
The following actions cannot be audited:
 
f
Read operations
 
f
Metadata changes
 
f
Text blobs, notes, and attachments
 
f
Export to Excel operations
 
f
Reporting
 
f
Querying with Advanced Find
 
f
Customization changes such as creating, modifying, or deleting Solution components

Chapter 4
187
Auditing can be enabled at the organization, entity and attribute levels. If auditing is not 
enabled at the organization level, auditing of entities and attributes, even if it is enabled,  
does not occur. By default, auditing is enabled on all auditable entity attributes but is  
disabled at the entity and organization level. When turning on auditing for an entity, all  
ields are automatically set to be audited. This can affect performance during saving of  
a record as each ield will need to be read and interpreted then saved to the database.
The best practice is to enable auditing only for those ields the organization 
would like to audit. Limiting auditing to only the ields and entities that 
are needed will improve the performance and eficiency of the Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
For a user to modify (enable or disable) organization level audit setting, the user must have 
the following access rights within Dynamics CRM 2011 system:
Audit settings Task
Required Privilege
Modify global auditing
Read and write access on Organization entity
Modify entity-level auditing
Read and write access on the entity
Modify user access auditing
Read and write access on Organization entity
View audit summary
Audit Summary View access
View audit history of entity records
Read access at entity level and 
View Audit History right
Manage audit logs
View Audit Partitions right and
Delete Audit Partitions right
Global audit settings cannot be exported using a Dynamics CRM 2011 solution. Only entity 
and ield-level audit settings can be exported via Dynamics CRM 2011 solution.
Viewing and cleaning audit records
After enabling auditing, Dynamics CRM 2011 will start auditing according to the settings. 
The next step will be to view and if necessary clean the audit log in the Dynamics CRM 2011 
system. In this recipe, we will discuss how to perform these operations.

Data Management
188
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to view audit summary records:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system with system administrator or relevant 
security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | System | Auditing | Audit Summary View.
3. Auditing records can be viewed here. The records can be iltered using the  
Enable/Disable Filters option.
Perform the following steps to clean the Audit Summary logs:
1. Navigate to Settings | Auditing | Audit Log Management.
2. All the audit logs will be visible there.
3. To delete a speciic audit log, select the audit log entry and then click on the Delete 
Logs option from the Actions menu.
How it works…
Audit Summary View displays the list of audit records. No Advanced Find or Worklow 
capability exists on Audit entity. Audit records also cannot be exported. No charts or  
views can be conigured on audit records.
Once auditing is enabled, an audit log ile is automatically created. This log ile is created 
automatically by the Dynamics CRM 2011 system and is not conigurable. This log gets 
created on a quarterly basis of the calendar year. The previous version of audit logs can be 
deleted. Once the audit log ile is deleted, the audit history for the related record in that time 
period is no longer available.
Audit logs use disk space, hence clean audit logs periodically. The oldest audit log has to be 
deleted before deleting the latest one.

Solution Management
Dynamics CRM 2011 is a lexible system and offers the opportunity to customize the system 
to meet the business needs. Dynamics CRM 2011 introduced Solution Framework—a 
container to store multiple customizations in an easy-to-manage package. Solutions make it 
easy to store customizations and move them from one organization to another. It is important 
to understand the solution management within Dynamics CRM 2011 for those who want to 
customize and develop Dynamics CRM 2011-based business solutions. In this chapter, we will 
delve into the recipes of Solution Management.
The following recipes will be discussed in this chapter:

Introduction to solution management
Solutions are the container where customizers and developers author and maintain 
customizations within a Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Solutions created in one organization 
can be moved to another organization without creating any installer. Solutions are created by 
using the customization tools or APIs included in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 and are fully 
hosted in the application. The following table outlines what a solution can contain:
Analytics
Process
Templates
Security
Entities
Attributes
Relationships
Global Option Sets
Ribbon
SiteMap
Forms
Web Resources
Dashboards
Reports
Visualizations
Security Roles
Field level Security
Profile
Mail-Merge
E-mail
Contract
Article
Dialogs
Workflows
Plugins
User Interface
Schema
Solutions are additive in nature. They can only add new components or override existing 
components, but cannot delete existing components.
If the customization also contains external components, which are not part of Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 solution components, we have to create a custom installer to install 
these components together.
There are two types of solutions as follows:
 
f
Unmanaged solution: Similar to writing the source code of a program, unmanaged 
solution is the only choice during development. From an unmanaged solution, we 
can add, remove, and update any of the components of the solution. An unmanaged 
solution helps in a multiple developer scenario, as every developer can work on the 
same unmanaged solution and once the development completes, the complete 
solution can be exported as a managed solution.
 
f
Managed solution: When our unmanaged solution is ready for deployment, we can 
export it as a managed solution. This is similar to compiled code. From managed 
solutions, we cannot add or remove components of the solution. We can only update 
those components of the managed solution that are not restricted for customization.

Chapter 5
193
In contrast to unmanaged and managed solutions, a default solution, comprises out  
of the box customizations with the standard Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 software.  
Without any managed solutions or customizations, the system solution deines the  
default application behavior.
Each solution requires a solution publisher. One default publisher is created when a 
Dynamics CRM 2011 organization is created. The default solution is published using the 
default publisher. Any custom unmanaged or managed solution can be published using  
either this default publisher or any custom publisher.
Creating a solution publisher
It is a recommended practice to create custom solution publishers before creating any 
unmanaged or managed solution. This helps in identifying the solutions created by different 
solution publishers. In this recipe, we will discuss how to create a solution publisher in 
Dynamics CRM 2011.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to create a solution publisher:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as system administrator or a user having 
customization access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Customizations | Publishers.
3. Click on New in the actions menu. Provide the following information on the  
Publisher: New Information page:
Settings
Description
General section
Display Name
The name that needs to be displayed in the publisher lookup 
field in the solution.
Name
Dynamics CRM 2011 generated a unique name based on the 
Display Name value.
Description
Description and additional details about the publisher.
Prefix name for custom entities and fields
Prefix
The customization prefix helps us identify which solution 
components are added by a solution created by this publisher.
The prefix must be between two and eight characters long, and 
can contain only alphanumeric characters. It cannot start with 
"mscrm".

Solution Management
194
Settings
Description
Option Value Prefix
This value helps us to identify the option sets added by a solution 
created by this publisher. The value must be between 10,000 
and 99,999
Contact details
Contact details of the publisher.
These settings are illustrated in the following screenshot:
4. Then, click on the Save and Close button in the top ribbon to save and close the 
publisher information.
How it works…
Each solution requires a solution publisher. The unique Name ield is used to uniquely identify 
the publishers. The solution publisher controls how managed solutions can be updated. 
Managed solutions that share the same publisher can update each other. Many solutions can 
be associated with a single solution publisher. Each organization will have a solution publisher 
called Default Publisher for <OrganizationUniqueName>. We can associate our solutions 
with the default publisher as well.
Creating a new unmanaged solution
After the creation of a new solution publisher, the next customization step is to create an 
unmanaged solution to contain the customizations. In this recipe, we will discuss how to 
create an unmanaged solution.

Chapter 5
195
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to create an unmanaged solution:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or a user having 
customization access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions.
3. Click on New in the actions menu.
4. The Solution: New page will pop up. Provide the following details on this page:
Settings
Description
Display Name
The name of the solution.
Name
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 generates a unique name based 
on the Display Name value. We can edit this name, but the name 
can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
Publisher
We can associate a publisher with the solution. Use the lookup 
button to search for a publisher.
Configuration Page
The solution configuration page provides a canvas that can be 
used to display information or enable customers to perform 
actions in the context of our solution. Set the configuration page 
by using the Configuration Page lookup field to select a web 
page (HTML) web resource included in the solution.
Version
Specify a version in the following format:
major.minor.build.revision
Description
Add details about the solution.
These settings are illustrated in the following screenshot:
5. Then, click on the Save and Close button on the top ribbon to save and close  
the solution.

Solution Management
196
How it works…
An unmanaged solution is usually created for development purposes and not intended for 
distribution. However, this is not a rule, rather a practice. If we do not need a managed 
solution, then we may not need to create an unmanaged solution; customizations can 
be done in the default solution also. But when we have to export the solution to another 
organization, then we need to create an unmanaged solution. Managed solutions are also 
created from an unmanaged solution.
When a solution is unmanaged, we can perform the following actions:
 
f
Add components
 
f
Remove components
 
f
Delete components that allow for deletion
 
f
Export and import the unmanaged solution
 
f
Export the solution as a managed solution
Adding an item in the unmanaged solution
After creating an unmanaged solution, the next logical step is to add customized items in the 
solution. In this recipe we will discuss how to add an item in the unmanaged solution.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to add an item in the unmanaged solution:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or a user having 
customization access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions.
3. Change the view to Unmanaged Solutions using the view selector. Then select the 
unmanaged solution from the list. Double-click on the solution name to open the 
solution contents as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
197
4. We can add the following types of items in the unmanaged solution:
 

Entities
 

Option Sets
 

Client Extensions
 

Web Resources
 

Processes
 

Plug-in Assemblies
 

Sdk Message Processing Steps
 

Service Endpoints
 



Article Templates
 

Contract Templates
 

Email Templates
 

Mail Merge Templates
 

Security Roles
 

Field Security Profiles
5. To add any of the aforementioned components, click on the component name.  
For example, if we want to add an entity, click on the Entities component.
6. Thereafter, if we wish to add an existing component to the solution, click on Add 
Existing in the actions menu. If we wish to add a new component, click on New  
in the actions menu:
Only a few components allow to add existing items, for example, Client Extensions 
allows us to add existing Ribbon or SiteMap components. Similarly, Plug-ins 
Assemblies and Sdk Message Processing Steps also allow us only to add  
from the existing registered plugins.
7. 
After components are added, click on the Save and Close button in the top ribbon to 
save the changes and close the web pop up.

Solution Management
198
How it works…
An unmanaged solution allows us to add an existing or any new item in the solution.  
We can create multiple unmanaged solutions to store different components of the entire 
customization. For example, one unmanaged solution can contain only the plugin assemblies 
and SDK messaging steps; another can only contain the ribbon customization and the last 
one can contain other components of the overall customization.
Any component we add to the unmanaged solution is included in the customizable solution 
components for the system. Any unmanaged solution component can be added to multiple 
unmanaged solutions and changes made to any of these shared components in any 
unmanaged solution will also be applied to all other unmanaged solutions sharing  
the component.
When we add components to any unmanaged solution, we need to be careful about the 
exported size of the solution.
For Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Online, the maximum size of the solution 
is 29.296 MB whereas, for on-premises, the default maximum size is 6 MB. If 
our solution ile's size is bigger than the speciied size, we will not be able to 
import them in another organization.
The maximum size of the solution in an on-premises deployment can be increased by 
editing the <httpRuntime> element in the web.config ile for the application. Edit the 
executionTimeout and maxRequestLength attributes to allow for the necessary size. 
After we inish installing the solution, we can reset it to the default size of 6 MB.
Removing/deleting an item from the 
unmanaged solution
During customization, we may want to exclude a few customizations from our unmanaged 
solution after we have added them. In this recipe, we will discuss how to remove or delete  
an item from the unmanaged solution.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to remove/delete an item from the unmanaged solution:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or a user having 
customization access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions.

Chapter 5
199
3. Change the view to Unmanaged Solutions using the view selector. Then select the 
unmanaged solution from the list. Double-click on the solution name to open the 
solution contents as shown in the following screenshot:
4. In the Unmanaged Solutions view, select the component type of the item to be 
removed/deleted. Then navigate to the item we want to remove/delete.
For example, if we want to delete a custom worklow from the solution, we irst have 
to navigate to Processes and then select the worklow to be removed/deleted. For 
items of the Processes (Worklows and Dialogs) and Sdk Message Processing Type 
(Plug-in Steps) type, if the item is in activate mode then we need to deactivate it 
before we can delete the item. For removing any item from the solution, there is no 
need to deactivate any active item:
To remove an item from the solution, select the item and then click on Remove in 
the actions menu. To delete an item, select the item and then click on Delete in the 
actions menu.
5. Once the item is successfully removed/deleted, click on Save and Close in the top 
ribbon. This will save the changes and close the page.
How it works…
An unmanaged solution allows us to remove and delete components from it. But there is a 
big difference between these two actions. The remove action only removes the item from the 
current unmanaged solution. If this item is included in any other unmanaged solution, it does 
not get automatically removed from that solution.
The delete action deletes the item from the system itself. Hence, this item would be deleted 
from all the solutions. The delete option is required to be exercised with utmost care. The 
delete action cannot be undone. If any item is accidentally deleted, we have to re-create it.

Solution Management
200
Hence, we should use "remove" instead of "delete" if we just want to remove a solution 
component from an unmanaged solution.
Exporting a solution
After making the customization, the customizations within an unmanaged solution 
are required to be exported from the environment so that they can be applied in other 
environments. In this recipe, we will discuss how to export a solution from the Dynamics  
CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to export a solution:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or a user having 
customization access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions.
3. Change the view to Unmanaged Solutions using the view selector. Then select the 
unmanaged solution from the list as shown in the following screenshot:
4. Then click on Export on the actions menu. The Export Solution web dialog will  
pop up.
5. On the Publish Customizations page, click on Publish All Customizations in case 
all the customizations of this unmanaged solution have not been published in the 
current organization. Otherwise, we can directly click on the Next button to proceed 
as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
201
6. If there are any required components that are missing in the unmanaged solution, 
the Missing Required Components page appears.
This page will list a set of components on which the components included in the 
current solution are linked. If we know that these required missing components will 
be present in the target organization where the exported solution will be imported, 
we can skip adding these components in the solution. But if any one of the required 
components is found to be missing in the target organization, the import of the 
exported solution will fail.
If some/all of the missing required components have to be added to this unmanaged 
solution, click on the Cancel button to cancel the export activity. Edit the solution to 
add these required components and then restart the export activity as mentioned in 
this recipe.
Otherwise, click on the Next button to proceed.

Solution Management
202
7. 
Next, you will see that the Export System Settings (Advanced) page appears. We can 
include any of the listed system settings from this environment to be exported with 
this solution, which will be applied on the organization where this exported solution 
will be imported. After the selection, click on Next to proceed:
8. Then, the Package Type page appears. In this page, we have to decide whether we 
want to export this unmanaged solution as an unmanaged or managed solution. 
Once the selection is done, click on the Export button to export the solution as  
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
203
9. Thereafter, a ile download prompt will appear. Click on Save/Save As to save the ile 
in the disk; we can rename the solution ile before saving. The solution ile can even 
be renamed after saving it to the disk.
How it works…
Only an unmanaged solution can be exported. An unmanaged solution can be exported as an 
unmanaged or managed solution. The exported solution can then be imported into another 
organization. This is how customizations are migrated from the development organization to 
the test or production systems. Managed solutions, however, cannot be exported.
Importing a solution
It is necessary to apply exported customizations  to another environment by importing them. 
In this recipe, we will discuss how to import a solution with Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to import a solution:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or a user having 
customization access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions.
3. Click on the Import button to import a solution.
4. The Import Solution web dialog will pop up. On the Select Solution Package page, 
click on the Browse button to browse the solution ile from the disk.  
Then click on Next to proceed:
5. Next, the Solution Information page will appear. Click on Next to proceed.

Solution Management
204
6. If there are any process type components (worklows or dialogs) or plugins existing 
in the solution, the Import Options page will appear. Here, tick the Activate any 
processes and enable any SDK message processing steps included in the solution 
checkbox if you want to activate the processes or SDK message processing steps 
automatically by this import process.
7. 
Then click on Next to proceed:
8. Then the solution import will begin. Once the import successfully completes, click on 
Close to close the Import dialog.
9. If an error occurs during the import, then we can click on Download Log File to 
download the solution import log ile to ind more about the error.
How it works…
The solution import will fail if all the required components are either not included in the 
solution or they do not exist in the target organization. When managed solutions are imported, 
all the required components should be of the managed type only. A component in a managed 
solution can only depend on another managed component.
We cannot import a managed solution into the Dynamics CRM 2011 organization that 
contains the unmanaged solution, which was used to create the managed solution. Managed 
solutions can only be installed in a different organization from the one it was generated.
Solution components cannot be added or removed from a managed solution. When managed 
solutions are imported, they are installed on top of the default solution. Managed solutions 
can also be layered on top of another managed solution. If a managed solution allows for 
customization of solution components, another managed solution can be installed on top  
of it that can also modify the customizable solution components.

Chapter 5
205
When two or more solutions deine a single component differently, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
2011 has to solve the conlict and it uses two strategies to resolve conlicts: merge and top 
wins. The conlict resolution mechanism stack ranks the layers created by the solutions 
imported within the organization. All unmanaged solutions are at the same layer. Hence, any 
unmanaged customization carried out in the system will only override the existing one. But 
managed solutions have the capability of keeping separate layers within the system. Conlicts 
involving managed solutions are resolved using the merge and top wins strategy. Managed 
solutions can be cleanly uninstalled because they maintain separate layers. If a managed 
solution is uninstalled, the system falls back to the other managed solutions installed in  
the organization.
Versioning of managed solutions is built-in and a managed solution having the same  
name but different version numbers is considered to be two different solution layers  
within the system.
 
f
Merge: The UI elements such as Ribbon, Forms, and SiteMap are merged, which 
means that the solution component would be recalculated from the lowest (oldest) to 
the highest (newest) so that the organization's unmanaged customization are the last 
to be applied. The following diagram will clarify the merge stack:

f
Top wins: For any other solution components, the last managed solution installed 
wins. However, any unmanaged customizations is considered "above" any  
managed solutions while resolving conlicts. Hence, sometimes changes applied 
to a managed solution may not be visible because of unmanaged customizations. 
When conlicts are detected while importing any managed solution with an existing 
unmanaged customization, the Dynamics CRM 2011 system provides us with the 
following options:
 

Maintain customizations (recommended): This option makes sure that the 
unmanaged customizations prevail.
 

Overwrite customizations: This option makes sure that any unmanaged 
customization performed earlier in the solution are overwritten by the  
current solution components.
Updating a managed solution
Usually it is a very common requirement to update customizations of an already installed 
managed solution in an organization. In this recipe, we will delve into the steps of  
updating a managed solution within the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Managed solution components can only be updated by another managed solution from the 
same publisher. There are two approaches to update the managed customizations by another 
managed solution:
 
f
Release a new version of the managed solution with all customizations (a full release)
 
f
Release a managed solution with only updated customizations (a delta release)
In this recipe, we will discuss both the approaches.
A full release will contain all the updated customizations along with other non-edited 
customizations. A full release will contain all the solution components of the managed 
solution it intends to update plus any additional component.
Follow the ensuing steps to create a new managed solution for a full release:
1. Update the unmanaged solution that was used to create the previous version of 
the managed solution, with an incremental version number. Navigate to Settings | 
Customization | Solutions section and select Unmanaged Solutions.
2. Double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it. Then click on the Information 
section of the unmanaged solution. Once the Information page appears, update the 
Version number as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
207
3. Next, click on the save icon [  ] in the top ribbon to save the changes.
4. Thereafter, make the necessary updates of the solution components.
5. Once the updates are completed, export the solution as a managed solution following 
the Exporting a solution recipe in this chapter.
A delta release will contain only the updated customizations of the managed solution 
previously installed.
Perform the following steps to create a delta release:
1. Create a new unmanaged solution by following the Creating a new unmanaged 
solution recipe in this chapter. Select the same publisher as that of the managed 
solution to be updated and use an incremental version number.
2. Thereafter, make the necessary updates of the solution components.
3. Once the updates are completed, export the solution as a managed solution following 
the Exporting a solution recipe.
How it works…
When we have to release an update to a managed solution, the preferred method is to 
provide a full release. Then the new managed solution of the full release will be installed 
in the organization, and the customizations will be upgraded to include the new changes. 
In case any conlicts arise, they will be resolved using either the merge or top wins strategy 
as discussed in the Importing a solution recipe. If we want to go back to the earlier version 
of the solution, we just have to reinstall the previous version of the managed solution. This 
overwrites any solution components with deinitions from the previous version, but does not 
remove solution components added in the newer version. Those newer solution components 
remain in the system but have no effect because the older solution component deinitions will 
not use them.
When a small subset of the customizations is updated, a delta release would be preferred. 
When the update solution is installed in an organization where the original solution was 
installed, the changes included in the update will be applied to the organization. If an 
organization needs to "roll back" to the original version, it can simply uninstall the update.

Solution Management
208
Deleting components from a managed 
solution
A customized component of a managed solution cannot be deleted by any solutions. The 
only way to remove customizable components from a managed solution is to delete solution 
components of a managed solution using the Customize the System option. In this recipe we 
will discuss how to do it.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to customize managed solution components:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or a user having 
customization access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Customizations | Customize the System.
3. This will launch the default solution of the organization.
4. We can navigate to any solution component. The default solution will allow us to 
customize any customizable component in the system.
5. Once the customizations are done, click on the save icon [  ] on the top ribbon.
6. Thereafter, click on the Publish All Customizations button on the top ribbon.
7. 
Finally, click on the Save and Close button on the top ribbon to close the page.
How it works
Using managed properties, the creator of a managed solution can decide if a solution 
component is customizable and if yes, which speciic parts of it can be customized. Managed 
properties can be set in the unmanaged solution. Once the customization is packaged 
as a managed solution, managed properties settings will take effect. The exact managed 
properties available depend on the type of solution component.

Chapter 5
209
The following screenshot displays the managed properties of the Account entity:
Managed solution components cannot be deleted from any organization, they can only be 
customized if the managed properties permit. If we intend to delete a component from a 
managed solution, we need to uninstall the entire solution and reinstall a new version of the 
managed solution without that solution component. But customizable managed components 
can be deleted using this recipe.
Uninstalling or deleting a solution
After importing a solution, at times we may want to uninstall or delete it from the environment. 
Though both managed and unmanaged solutions support different behavior, both these 
solution types can be uninstalled or deleted post the import. In this recipe, we will discuss 
how to do this within the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to uninstall or delete a solution:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or a user having 
customization access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions.
3. Select the solution to be deleted from the list.
4. Next, click on the Delete button in the actions menu.

Solution Management
210
5. The Conirm Deletion page will appear. On this page, click on OK to uninstall or 
delete the solution as shown in the following screenshot:
How it works…
Uninstallation/deletion of managed and unmanaged solutions has a different effect on the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
When an unmanaged solution is deleted it just deletes the solution container but does not 
delete the solution components the unmanaged solution contained. The solution components 
remain in the system, but are no longer associated with the unmanaged solution. Hence, 
unmanaged solution uninstallation actually uninstalls nothing from the system.
Deleting or uninstalling a managed solution will uninstall all the solution components within it.
Exporting translations from an unmanaged 
solution
Translations are XML documents that deine the display names and descriptions for entities, 
ields, navigation items, and so on, for a solution. Translations can be exported, modiied, and 
reimported into Dynamics CRM 2011 to support localization. In this recipe, we will discuss 
how to export translations from an unmanaged solution.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to export the translations from a solution:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or a user having 
customization access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Unmanaged Solutions.

Chapter 5
211
3. Select the solution from the list.
4. Next, click on the Export Translations button in the actions menu:
5. When prompted, save the translation ile to the disk.
6. After saving the translation ile, we can edit the translations outside the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 environment. Extract the ZIP ile and open the CrmTranslations.xml 
ile in Microsoft Excel.
7. 
Once the editing is complete, again zip the contents into a translation ZIP ile.
How it works…
Translations can only be exported from unmanaged solutions. Managed solutions do not allow 
to export or import translations.
Translations help us in modifying system messages and text literals. We usually change the 
translations in a multilanguage deployment. A translation ile contains translated text for all 
types of text displayed within the system against the language code. For English, the language 
code is 1033.
The following screenshot is a sample of translation ile contents when opened using  
Microsoft Excel:
We are allowed to modify only the language columns of the ile (in the preceding screenshot, 
texts under the 1033 column only). If we modify the schema columns, the import of the 
translations will fail.

Solution Management
212
Importing translations to an unmanaged 
solution
Translations are usually exported for making any change to the entity labels, navigation text, 
and so on. Post modiications, the translations will be imported back to an environment. In 
this recipe, we will discuss how to import translations into an unmanaged solution.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to export the translations from a solution:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or a user having 
customization access rights.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions.
3. Select the solution from the list.
4. Next, click on the Import Translations button in the actions menu as shown in the 
following screenshot:
5. The Import Translated Text web dialog will appear. Use the Browse button to browse 
the translations ile to be imported in the disk. Then, click on the Import button to 
import the translations to the solution.

Chapter 5
213
6. Next, you will see the Translations successfully imported message. Click on the 
Close button to complete the import:
How it works…
We can modify the translations outside the Dynamics CRM 2011 environment using editing 
tools such as Microsoft Excel and then the modiied translations ile can be imported into an 
unmanaged solution. Managed solutions are locked down and do not allow modiication of 
the translation iles.

Entity Customizations
Entities constitute the core of the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Entities are used to model 
and manage the business data. Dynamics CRM 2011 provides a set of entities to store data 
related to sales, marketing, and services functions. These existing entities can be customized 
and we can also create new entities in the system to support the business process. In this 
chapter, we will discuss the recipes for creating a new entity and customizing existing entities. 
In addition, we will also discuss the relationship behavior between two entities. The following

Introduction to entities
Entities are basic building blocks of the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Entities contain data, 
form, views, relationships, and charts, which are associated with presenting information to 
users. There are three main types of entities inside the Dynamics CRM 2011 system: system 
entities, business entities, and custom entities.
 
f
System entities: Entities that are used internally by the Dynamics CRM 2011 system 
are known as system entities. For example, worklows, system jobs, solutions, and so 
on. are system entities. System entities cannot be customized or deleted.

Entity Customizations
216
 
f
Business entities: Business entities are entities other than system entities present 
after the installation of Dynamics CRM. Business entities store business data for 
the sales, marketing, and services modules. Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, 
Campaign, and Case are a few examples of business entities. Business entities can 
be customized but cannot be deleted.
 
f
Custom entities: After the installation of Dynamics CRM, we can create additional 
custom entities to fulill the needs of the business process. Custom entities can 
be deleted as well. Custom entities can be marked as either "customizable" or 
"noncustomizable" during publishing. Noncustomizable entities cannot be  
customized in future.
Entities are similar to tables in any relational database and entity attributes are like columns 
in that table. But within the Dynamics CRM system, entity data are not necessarily stored in 
one database table.
There are two speciic types of business entities, which are worth a mention here:
 
f
Customer: This is a composite entity and comprises Account and Contact. In 
Dynamics CRM 2011, an account represents a business or company and a contact 
usually represents an individual. Both Account and Contact manage a customer.
 
f
Activity: This is a special type of business entity. These types of entities represent 
any activity or task that is performed or needs to be performed. Activity type entities 
are Phone Call, E-mail, Task, Letter, Fax, Appointment, and Recurring Appointment. 
Activity entities are associated with other business entities such as Account, Contact, 
Case, Lead, and Opportunity.
The following diagram shows how an activity is linked with other entities within 
Dynamics CRM:
Owner
Activity
Notes
Account
Contact
Lead
Opportunity
Case
Quote
Order
Invoice
Contract
Activity Party
Phone Call
E-mail
Letter
Appointment
Fax
 
Activities involve one or more participants, called activity parties in Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011. For an Appointment activity, the participants are those 
contacts or users attending the meeting and for an E-mail activity, the participants 
are the sender and the recipients of the e-mail.

Chapter 6
217
Activity entities are synced with Microsoft Outlook. Custom activities can also be 
created for supporting activities such as instant messaging (IM) or Short Message 
Service (SMS). But custom activities do not synchronize with Microsoft Outlook.
Entity ownership
Entities within the Dynamics CRM 2011 system can be owned by the organization or the 
business unit or "by a user or a team" or by none. Here, let us discuss the ownership in  
detail with the help of the following table:
Entity ownership 
type
Description
Can we create 
custom entities 
of this type?
Security and  
access-level depth
Organization
Entity data is viewable within the 
whole organization. Such entity 
records cannot be assigned or 
shared. For example, Product, 
Article, Discount List, and so on, 
are organization-owned entities.
Organization-
owned custom 
entities can be 
created.
Organization-owned 
entities provide loose 
security permissions 
around its data. The 
security access levels 
around such an entity are 
only Global or None.
Business unit
Entity data is viewable within the 
business unit. User, Team, and 
so on, are business unit-owned 
entities. Custom entities can also 
be business unit-owned.
Business unit-
owned custom 
entities cannot be 
created.
Such an entity provides 
little stricter security 
permission compared 
to organization-owned 
entities around its data. 
The access levels around 
such an entity are Global, 
Deep, Local, and None.
User or team
Entity data is viewable only 
by the user or team who has 
created it. Most of the entities 
such as Account, Contact, Lead, 
Opportunity, Campaign, and so 
on, are user- or team-owned 
entities. Custom entities can also 
be user- or team-owned.
User- or team-
owned custom 
entities can be 
created.
User- or team-owned 
entities provide stricter 
security permissions 
around the data. Entity 
records for such entities 
can be shared with 
another user or team 
using Assign or Share. 
The access levels around 
such an entity are Global, 
Deep, Local, Basic, and 
None.
None
Such an entity does not have 
an owner. Their owner is usually 
driven by the parent entity owner. 
For example, the Price List Item 
entity does not have an owner 
and its ownership is driven by 
the parent entity Price List.
Custom entities 
cannot be created 
with "None" as 
the owner.
Security privilege cannot 
be set against such 
an entity. There are no 
access levels for this type 
of entity.

Entity Customizations
218
Creating a custom entity
Custom entities are entities created by a system administrator or customizer for fulilling a 
business need that is not satisied with out of the box entities. In this recipe, we will discuss 
how to create a custom entity in Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to create a custom entity:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.
Custom entities can be created in the default solution, 
but in that case the prefix for the entity and its attributes 
would be new_. To apply the solution publisher's prefix 
for custom entities and fields, create them using an 
unmanaged solution only.
3. Then, double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. In the expanded solution page, click on Entities under the Components section.  
After the page refreshes, click on the New button in the actions menu as shown  
in the following screenshot:
5. On the New Information page, under the General tab, provide the  
following information:

6. In the Primary Field section, create the primary ield of the entity providing all the 
required information.

Entity Customizations
222
Every entity is required to have one primary field. This field will 
be used to name the records of this entity. A primary field can 
only be a Single Line of Text attribute with a maximum 
of 4000 number of characters, 100 being the default. Once 
the entity is created, the primary field's properties cannot be 
changed from the Primary Field tab. However, Display Name, 
Length, and Requirement Level of this field can be changed by 
navigating to the list of Fields of the entity.
The lookup view of this entity will only contain the primary field 
as its first column. This field or its column order cannot be 
removed or altered from the lookup view.
7. 
Thereafter, click on the Save and Close button in the top ribbon to create and save a 
new entity.
8. Then click on the Publish button in the newly created entity's ribbon menu.

How it works…
A custom entity can be created in the default solution or in any unmanaged solution. In this 
recipe, we have discussed how to create a custom entity in an unmanaged solution, as this 
is recommended. To create a custom entity in a default solution, open the default solution by 
navigating to Settings | Customization | Customizations | Customize the Entity. Thereafter, 
the same recipe can be followed from step 4 onwards.
In Dynamics CRM 2011 Online, only 200 custom entities 
can be created.
Custom entities support almost every feature of the business entities. Some of the main 
functionalities supported by a custom entity are as follows:
 
f
Forms, views, and reports
 
f
Relationships for custom entities can be deined
 
f
Publish, export, and import the new entities and their associated forms and views
 
f
Plugins, worklows, or dialogs can also be created against a custom entity
 
f
Client-side events function in the same manner as those for system entities
 
f
We can secure a custom entity in the same way as other Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
2011 entities
 
f
The security privileges available for organization-owned custom entities are as 
follows: create, read, write, delete, append, and append to
 
f
The security privileges available for user-owned custom entities are as follows: create, 
read, write, delete, append, append to, assign, and share
 
f
A custom entity can be extended using the ISV.config ile in the same manner as 
system entities
 
f
The iltered views for a custom entity are available to be used in the same manner as 
for system entities
 
f
The entity can be included in the dataset that Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for 
Microsoft Ofice Outlook users can take ofline

Entity Customizations
224
Following the same recipe we can create custom activity type entities and privileges as well:
 
f
Custom activity entity: To create a custom activity type entity, enable the Deine as 
an Activity Entity property. If we wish this new entity to be grouped with the existing 
activities, we have to enable the Display in Activity Menus option as well.
Custom activity entity records automatically qualify to be sent to a queue. However, 
we can determine whether we want the records to be sent to the record owner's 
default queue post record creation or assignment by choosing the Automatically 
move records to the owner's default queue when a record is created or  
assigned option.
The custom activity type entities are always user- or team-owned. Moreover, not all 
the entity settings are available for custom activity entities. Only the following settings 
are available for custom activities:
 


Reading pane for CRM in Outlook
Custom activities do not synchronize with 
Microsoft Outlook.
Customizable settings of a custom entity as well as a business entity can be modiied 
by navigating to the entity section in the solution. A custom entity can also be deleted 
permanently from the Dynamics CRM 2011 system by using the Delete button.
 
f
Custom entity privileges: After creation of a custom entity, the entity name will start 
appearing under the Custom Entities tab in any security role. However, except for 
the System Administrator, no other security role will have any access deined for 
the custom entity. Hence, post entity creation, security roles have to be updated to 
provide access to the custom entity:
Like other system-deined activities, custom activity entities also share the same 
privileges as deined for the Activity entity under any security role. Hence, for  
custom activities there is no need to modify any security role.
With the custom entity creation, there will be a set of ields automatically created  
for it. If the entity is user- or team-owned, two ields, Owner and Owning Team,  
will be created automatically to store the user or the team owning the entity  
record respectively.
Every entity in Dynamics CRM 2011 will have the Status (Activity Status in case of 
an Activity entity) and Status Reason ields. Only the Display Name value of these 
ields can be edited. The Status ield for a custom entity has only two values, Active 
and Inactive. By default, every record when created has Status as Active. When it 
is deactivated, the Status ield changes to Inactive. Only active records of an entity 
can be searched using Quick Find View; however, Advanced Find View can list even 
inactive records. Status Reason is a dependent pick list and its values changes 
depending on the value of the Status ield.

Entity Customizations
226
Finally, only custom entities can be deleted from the system. To delete a custom entity from 
the Dynamics CRM 2011 system, navigate to Settings | Customization | Customizations | 
Customize the System and then click on the Entities component and select the entity to be 
deleted. Click on Delete in the toolbar and then click on OK to conirm the deletion.
Updating the icon of an entity
After creating an entity in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system, the default icon is linked to any 
entity. This default icon can be modiied to a more appropriate icon. In this recipe, we will 
discuss how to update the icon of a custom entity.
How to do it…
Please perform the following steps to update the icon of a custom entity:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.
3. Then double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. Navigate to the custom entity by going to Components | Entities | <Custom Entity 
Name>. Then click on the custom entity name.
5. Then the top ribbon will refresh and the Update Icons button will be visible. Click on 
this button as shown in the following screenshot:

7. 
To select a new icon for a web application, click on the New Icon lookup under the 
Icon in Web Application section. The Lookup Record web dialog will pop up. In this 
dialog, select the icon web resource (if it already exists) and then click on the  
OK button.
If the icon has not already been added as a web resource, we have to irst add it as 
a web resource and then we can select it here. To add the icon ile as a new web 
resource, click on the New button as shown in the following screenshot:

Entity Customizations
228
The Web Resource: New page will appear. On this page provide the Name and 
Display Name values, and the content type of the icon. Then click on the Save and 
Close button in the top ribbon as shown in the following screenshot:
8. Now we can ind the icon web resource in the Look Up Record web dialog. Select the 
icon web resource and click on OK to proceed.
9. Add the icon for Icon in Entity Forms by following steps 7 to 9.
10. Thereafter, click on the OK button on the Select New Icons page to save and close 
the selections.
11. The icon of the entity will now be updated.
How it works…
In this recipe, we have discussed how to update the icon of a custom entity using an 
unmanaged solution. We can update the icon using the default solution. To update the icon 
of a custom entity in a default solution, open the default solution by navigating to Settings | 
Customization | Customizations | Customize the System. Thereafter the same recipe can 
be followed from step 4 onwards.
Dynamics CRM 2011 stores the icons into web resources. Hence, the same icon can be  
re-used for multiple entities, as required.

Chapter 6
229
Icons of a system entity or business entity cannot be updated. Only icons of 
custom entities can be updated.
Creating a custom ield for an entity
In Dynamics CRM 2011, we can create custom ields or attributes to satisfy the needs of the 
business processes. New ields or attributes can be added to a business entity as well as a 
custom entity. In this recipe, we will discuss how to add a custom ield to an entity.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to create a new attribute for an entity:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.
3. Then double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. Navigate to the entity to which the custom ield needs to be added by going to 
Components | Entities | <Entity Name>.
5. Then expand the Entity section and click on Fields. Then click on New in the Fields 
page's toolbar as shown in the following screenshot:

the maximum value is 
1,000,000,000. Precision 
is up to 5 digits.
Decimal Number
SQL data type: decimal
Allows a decimal number within the range and 
precision specified. Decimal types take more 
space in database, but provide more precision 
than Floating Point Number.
Precision up to 10 digits.
Currency
SQL data type: money
Accepts a money value within the specified 
range.
Adding a money field, automatically adds 
another extra field with same name but 
prefixed with Base to handle a multicurrency 
configuration. The base attribute stores the 
value of the money attribute in the base 
currency.
Each entity that has a money attribute must 
also have the Currency and Exchange

Date Only
Accepts a date value. Provides a Calendar 
control to select a date.
Date and Time
Accepts a date and time value. Provides both a 
Calendar control to select a date and a Time 
control to select time.
Lookup
SQL data type: 
Uniqueidentifier
Allows you to select a record from another 
entity. Creating this field will create a N:1 or 
many-to-one relationship with another entity.
The Requirement Level setting determines how important the ield is in the business process. 
There are three possible settings:
 
f
Business Required: This ield should be mandatorily populated and there will be a 
red asterisk next to the ield in the form. But if data is entered using Import Data 
Wizard or via the Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK, then such a ield can be left blank.
 
f
Business Recommended: Though this ield need not be populated to save the form 
data, it is an important ield in the business process and there will be a blue plus sign 
next to the ield in the form.
 
f
No Constraint: This is the default setting. It is a regular ield with no constraints. 
Providing a value for such a ield is optional.
System Required is a system-deined requirement level. This 
is used for some system-deined ields and cannot be used for 
any custom ields. Unlike the Business Required ields, System 
Required ields restrict a user from creating a record from both UI 
and programmatic ways without providing the ield's value.
Potential Customer in an Opportunity entity is a System 
Required ield as well as the Owner ield in any entity.
Make a ield searchable if you want the Searchable ield to be available for querying Dynamics 
CRM to retrieve data. By default, most of the out-of-the box ields and all the custom ields 
are searchable. Nonsearchable ields will not be available when creating the ilter criteria for 
system views, user views, advanced ind views, or others.
The input method editor mode (IME mode) allows Dynamics CRM to work with Chinese, 
Korean, and Japanese characters. If we don't intend to use any of the languages, we can 
safely leave the default setting for this attribute. The listed languages have more characters 
than other keyboards and IME allows a sequence of characters to represent a single character 
in these languages. The options for IME mode setting are:
 
f
auto: This speciies that the IME mode is not changed.

Entity Customizations
234
 
f
inactive: This speciies all characters entered without IME mode, but the mode can 
be deactivated. For Date and Time type ields, the default is inactive.
 
f
active: This speciies all characters entered in IME mode, but the mode can be 
deactivated. For name-related ields and addresses, the default is active.
 
f
disabled: This speciies that the IME mode is disabled and cannot be activated. For 
number type ields such as Currency, Whole Number, and Floating Point 
Number, the default is disabled.
There's more…
After creating a custom ield, a few properties can be modiied. Even most of the system-
deined existing ields can be modiied. The following is a list of properties of any ield that 
cannot be modiied post creation:
 
f
The Name value of a ield. This is the schema name of the ield and hence cannot be 
edited. However, Display Name of a ield can be modiied.
 
f
The Type property of a ield cannot be modiied. If we want to change the data type of 
a ield, the exiting ield has to be deleted and recreated with the correct data type.
Creating a global option set
A global option set provides us with the mechanism to deine an option set once and re-use it 
in various ields of different entities in the system. By using the global option set feature, there 
is no need to redeine the same option set separately each time it is used. The Dynamics CRM 
2011 system provides us with a set of global option sets out of the box. We should explore 
these existing ones before creating a new one. The list of existing global option sets can be 
found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/gg328546.aspx.
In this recipe, we will discuss how to create a custom global option set.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to create a global option set:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.
3. Then double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. Navigate to the global option sets by going to Components | Option Sets. Then click 
on the New button in the actions toolbar.

Chapter 6
235
5. The Option Set New page will appear. Please provide the following details about the 
global option set on this page:
 

Display Name: The Display name of the option set
 

Name: The unique schema name of the option set
 

Description: The description of the option set
6. Thereafter, click on the add button (a green plus sign) under the Options section to 
add option texts in the option set. Populate the following ields for each option:
 

Label: The display text for the option. This can be modified any time  
after creation.
 

Description: A description about the option. This is optional.
 

Value: This will be autopopulated with a predefined value. This value is 
based on the Option Value Prefix value of the publisher of this solution. 
Every time an option value is added to the global option set, a unique value 
is created by autoincrementing the number after Option Value Prefix.
In a default solution, the Option Value Prefix value 
will be 10,000.
Although, this value can be edited, it is best practice to accept the 
autogenerated value.

Entity Customizations

7. 
After adding all the option texts, click on the Save and Close button in the top ribbon.
8. Then, select the option set added in the list of options sets and click on the Publish 
button in the actions menu as shown in the following screenshot:
How it works…
Global option sets are available to be used in every entity form. The label of every option text 
is the display format for the option and the value part is a numerical value and is what gets 
stored in the database.
To use a global option set for an entity ield, navigate to the entity Fields section of an 
unmanaged solution or default solution and click on New. In the new custom ield form 
provide/specify the Type value as Option Set and set the Use Existing Option Set ield to 
Yes. Finally, set the Option Set value to the global option set. Then save and close the form:
The global option set can be modiied by clicking on the Edit button in the previous screenshot 
or a new one can be created by clicking on the New button.
Not all existing option sets can be edited. Only those option sets that 
are customizable can be edited. To check whether a global option is 
customizable, navigate to Components | Option Sets of the solution and 
check the Customizable column value for the option set. Set the View 
drop-down box to All in the actions toolbar.
A global option set can be deleted permanently from the Dynamics CRM system using the 
Delete button in the toolbar menu of the global option set.

Creating a new one-to-many (1:N) or  
many-to-one (N:1) relationship
In this recipe, we will discuss the various entity types possible between two entities in 
Dynamics CRM 2011 and how to create a one-to-many or many-to-one relationship between 
two entities.
Getting ready
Dynamics CRM 2011 supports two types of relationships between two entities:
 
f
One-to-many (1:N) or many-to-one (N:1): An example of this relationship would be, 
an Account can have many Leads linked to it. If it is viewed from the other side, the 
relationship would be many Leads can be linked to one Account.
 
f
Many-to-many (N:N): An example of this relationship would be, an Account can be 
linked to many Marketing Lists and a Marketing List can have many Accounts.
These are illustrated in the following diagram:
Lead
Account
Marketing List
The 1:N self-referencing relationship is also supported. An example would be an Account 
can be the parent of many other Accounts. The Parent Account ield in the Account entity 
represents a 1:N self-referential relationship.
The 1:1 relationship type is not supported in Dynamics CRM 2011.
How to do it…
Let us consider a scenario where we will create a one-to-many (1:N) relationship between 
a custom entity Region and a business entity Account. This relationship can be viewed as 
many-to-one (N:1) between Account and Region as well. The same recipe can be followed to 
create a one-to-many (1:N) or many-to-one (N:1) relationship between any two entities.
Please follow the next steps to create a new one-to-many (1:N) relationship between Region 
and Account:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.

Then click on the Save and Close button in the top ribbon to create the new

How it works…
One-to-many or many-to-one relationships are common in the Dynamics CRM system. If an 
entity "X" is linked to another entity "Y" via a one-to-many relationship, the entity "Y" is linked 
to the entity "X" via the many-to-one relationship. Despite the fact that there are two separate 
relationship options, that is, 1:N and N:1, it is not needed to create both for any two entities. 
Once we create one of these relationships, the other one automatically exists.
When we create lookup ields in an entity, a many-to-one relationship is automatically created 
between the current entity and the entity to be looked up.
The type of behavior is a very important feature of one-to-many or many-to-one relationship. 
This, however, does not exist for many-to-many relationships. The type of behavior decides 
how the change made to the parent entity will cascade down to the related child entity records 
for various actions. The possible types of behavior are as follows:

Chapter 6
241
Type of behavior
Description
Parental
This cascades all changes from the parent record to child records.
Referential
This does not cascade any change from the parent record to the 
child records. This is the default behavior type.
Referential, Restrict 
Delete
This does not cascade any change from the parent record to the 
child record; however, it does prohibit parent records from being 
deleted if there are associated child records.
Configurable Cascading
This allows us to set the cascading behavior rules for six behavior 
actions.
Behavior actions are six different actions that are performed on the related or child entity 
records when the same action has been performed on a primary entity record. The six 
behavior actions are as follows:
 
f
Assign
 
f
Share
 
f
Unshare (revoking Share)
 
f
Reparent (associating with a new parent record)
 
f
Delete
 
f
Merge
Different cascading behavior rules can be applied to each of the six behavior actions:
 
f
Cascade All: This cascades changes made to the parent record to all child records
 
f
Cascade Active: This cascades changes made to the parent record to all active  
child records
 
f
Cascade User-owned: This cascades changes made to the parent record to all child 
records having the same owner as of the parent record
 
f
Cascade None: This does not cascade the change to the child record
 
f
Remove Link: When the parent record is deleted, this rule removes the link of the 
parent record from the child record, instead of deleting the child records
 
f
Restrict: This does not allow the parent record to be deleted if it contains any 
associated child records

Creating a new many-to-many (N:N) 
relationship
In the previous recipe, we discussed how to create a one-to-many relationship between two 
entities and in this recipe, we will discuss how to create a many-to-many (N:N) relationship 
between two entities.
How to do it…
Let us consider a scenario where we will create a many-to-many relationship between a 
custom entity Region and a business entity Account. This means a Region can be linked to 
many Accounts and many Regions can be linked to one Account. The same recipe can be 
followed to create a many-to-many relationship between any two entities.
Perform the following steps to create a new many-to-many relationship between Region  
and Account:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.
3. Then double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. Navigate to the Region entity's many-to-many relationships section by going to 
Components | Entities | Region | N: N Relationships.
5. Then click on the New Many-to-Many-Relationship button in the actions toolbar as 
shown in the following screenshot:

8. Then click on the Save and Close button in the top ribbon to create the new 
relationship and save it.
How it works…
Many-to-many relationships enable you to establish a link between many records of one entity 
and many records of another entity. Unlike one-to-many relationships, there is no lookup ield 
on either entity. Related records using a many-to-many relationship can be considered peers 
and the relationship its reciprocal. A many-to-many relationship may also be self-referential. 
As there is no cascading behavior involved in many-to-many relationships, we can allow an 
individual record to have a reference to itself.
With an N:N relationship, we cannot import data using Import Data Wizard and link them 
using the N:N relationship. For example, we cannot import a set of accounts and associate 
them with different Region records.
Moreover, we cannot execute any worklow against an N:N relationship. For example,  
we cannot execute a notiication worklow when an Account is added to a Region.
Finally, in an advanced ind query, the columns of only one entity from an N:N relationship 
alone can be added. For example, if we are creating an advance ind query for the Region 
entity, only the Region entity columns can be added for a query deined using the native  
N:N relationship.

Entity Customizations
246
There's more…
The N:N relationship deined in this recipe, is usually known as the native many-to-many 
relationship. There is another way to create a many-to-many relationship between two entities 
in Dynamics CRM 2011 and it is known as a manual many-to-many relationship. Using a 
combination of two N:1 relationships, which shares a common intersect entity, a manual  
N:N relationship can be established between the two entities.
In this recipe our native N:N relationship is where one Region can be linked to many Accounts 
and many Regions can be linked to one Account. Now, instead of creating a direct N:N 
relationship, we can introduce an intersection entity called "Ofice" between the Region and 
Account entity. We can create an N:1 relationship between the intersect entity "Ofice" and 
Region as there can be many ofices in one Region. Another N:1 relationship can be created 
between the intersect entity "Ofice" and the Account entity as many Ofices can be linked to 
one Account or, in other words, an Account can have many Ofices:
Region
Account
Office
Native N:N Relationship
Manual N:N Relationship
Account
Region
In one sense both these types of N:N relationships are the same. But in Dynamics CRM 
2011, the manual N:N relationship provides some additional beneits and hence, it is worth 
considering. The beneits with manual N:N relationships are as follows:
 
f
Data can be imported using Import Data Wizard and linked to each other. Manual 
N:N relationships are based on two lookup ields (N:1 relationships). Lookup ields 
are supported in data import using Import Data Wizard.
 
f
Worklows can be executed on the intersect entity (Ofice). Hence, it is possible to ind 
out when an Account's Ofice is added to a Region.
 
f
An advanced ind view on the intersect entity (Ofice) can include columns from both 
the Region and Account entities.

Chapter 6
247
Creating a relationship ield mapping
When we establish a one-to-many or many-to-one relationship between two entities, Dynamics 
CRM 2011 allows us to create ield mappings to reduce the data entry required when a record 
is created within the context of a primary record. In this recipe, we will discuss how to create 
relationship ield mapping in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
How to do it…
Let us consider that we have created a one-to-many relationship between two entities Account 
and Ofice, where one Account (primary entity) can have many Ofices (related entity). Both of 
these entities have a Website ield. Using relationship mapping we want to make sure that 
when an ofice record is created from the associated view on an Account form, the account 
record's website entry gets automatically populated to the ofice record.
Please perform the following steps to create a ield mapping:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.
3. Then double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. Navigate to the primary entity's (Account) one-to-many relationships section by going 
to Components | Entities | Account | 1:N Relationships.
5. In the actions toolbar, select Mappable in the Type drop-down list.
6. The view will display a list of mappable relationships with this entity. Double-click on 
the relationship against which the ield mapping is to be added.
7. 
On the Relationship form, click on Mappings under the Common section.
8. This will display a list of existing ield mappings for this relationship.
9. To create a new ield mapping, click on the New button in the actions toolbar.
10. With this the Create Field Mapping From <Primary Entity> to <Related Entity> 
page will appear.

Entity Customizations
248
11. Select the source ield from Source Entity Fields and target ield from Target Entity 
Fields as shown in the following screenshot:
12. Click on OK to save the changes.
13. Click on Save and Close in the Relationship form.
14. Click on Publish All Customizations to publish the changes.
How it works…
As stated earlier, relationship ield mappings reduce the data entry effort when a related entity 
record is created from a primary entity record form. In our example, if we open an account record 
having data for the Website ield and then create an ofice record from this account form using 
associated view, we can see that the ofice record's Website ield is automatically populated with 
the same URL copied from the account record. This is shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 6
249
The requirements for entity ield mapping are as follows:
 
f
Both the source and target ields must have the same data type and format.
 
f
One target ield can only be mapped on one source ield, but one source ield can be 
mapped to multiple target ields.
 
f
Only editable ields available on the source entity form are available for mapping.
 
f
If both source and target ields are text ields, the target ield length must be equal to 
or greater than source ield length.
 
f
If both source and target ields are option sets, each of the source option numeric 
value must match the target option numeric value.

Form and View Customizations

Introduction
Forms are probably the most important visual element of the Dynamics CRM 2011 interface. 
To ind the underlying data in every entity record, the user has to open the form. Dynamics 
CRM 2011 supports two types of forms:
 
f
The main form: Dynamics CRM 2011 uses this form to allow the user to enter and 
view data within the Dynamics CRM 2011 web user interface as well as the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 within Microsoft Outlook interface.
One main form per entity exists by default. However, multiple 
main forms can be created for an entity. Dynamics CRM 
2011 supports role-based forms, which means separate 
forms can be visible depending on the security roles of the 
current user. Usually, multiple main forms are created when 
role-based forms have to be supported.
 
f
The mobile form: Dynamics CRM 2011 uses this form when a user is accessing CRM 
from a mobile device that is compatible with HTML 4.0 using a URL such as <CRM_
server> /m, where <CRM_server> is the path of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 
Server. A separate form for mobile devices is useful considering the limited space 
usually available on a mobile screen. A mobile form does not store data on a  
mobile device.
If users try to access Dynamics CRM 2011 from an unsupported browser, they will be 
redirected to the mobile form.
The following table outlines the browsers supported by Microsoft Dynamics  
CRM 2011:
Browser
Version / other requirements
Internet Explorer
IE7 (only for the on-premises version)
IE 8, IE9
IE10 (desktop mode only)
Mozilla Firefox
Latest publicly released version running on Windows 8, 
Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP
Google Chrome
Latest publicly released version running on Windows 8, 
Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP
Apple Safari
Latest publicly released version running on Mac OS X 10.7 
(Lion) or 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
Detailed information about supported browsers can be found at

Chapter 7
253
Dynamics CRM 2011 also supports special variants of the main form, as follows:
 
f
The read-optimized form: Dynamics CRM 2011 has another type of form called  
the read-optimized form. Introduced in Update Rollup 7, this form is designed for  
the fast display of a record by disabling the ribbon and form scripts. This form 
displays the record in the read-only mode. Read-optimized forms are disabled by 
default and can be enabled by going to System | Administration | System Settings 
| Customization | Form Mode.
Update Rollup 12 has introduced the following changes in read-optimized forms:
 

The navigation pane for read-optimized forms is now enabled and the 
navigation pane can be expanded or collapsed.
 

Support for web resources has been added. A new setting in the web 
resource properties, called Show this Web Resources in Read Optimized 
form, has been added. This setting must be enabled for the web resources 
to display in the read-optimized form. If the web resource depends on form 
resources, which are not available in a read-optimized form, we should not 
display it.
Read-optimized forms honor all field-level security and role-based 
form definitions. If an entity has more than one form enabled, the 
read-optimized form uses the form that the user last used.
 
f
The process-driven form: The December 2012 Service Update (Polaris update) of 
Dynamics CRM 2011 has introduced an enhanced read-optimized form, commonly 
known as the process-driven form for the Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and 
Case entities. This new type of form is very useful, especially for touch devices, as 
the new form is designed to contain everything in one form; there is no need to open 
multiple pop ups. However, this new form type cannot be used for any entity other 
than the entities listed above.
For the Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and Case entities, in addition to the 
information form, there will be a new form with the same name as that of the entity. 
The <entity name> form will always display using the updated presentation, 
regardless of the settings for read-optimized forms. However, if read-optimized  
forms are enabled for the organization, the information form will also display  
using the updated presentation.
These new forms are not available in an on-premises deployment of Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011.

Form and View Customizations
254
Form editor
We need to use a form editor to customize a form within Dynamics CRM 2011. The form 
layout deinition is actually stored as an XML ile called Form Xml in the SystemForm entity. 
The customization.xml ile exported with an unmanaged solution contains the deinition 
of the entity forms.
Creating and customizing an entity main form
Almost all the business entities have a customizable main form. The Activity entity does 
not have any form and some entity forms such as the Case Resolution entity form are not 
customizable. When a custom entity is created, one main and one mobile form are added 
automatically. In this recipe, we will focus our discussion on how to customize a main form.
Getting ready
Dynamics CRM 2011 introduced a lexible layout for form design. The following diagram 
outlines the typical main form layout within the Dynamics CRM 2011 system:

Chapter 7
255
The major visible components of a standard main form are as follows:
 
f
Ribbon: This is the top area of the form. We cannot customize this using the form 
editor. We can ind more information on how to customize the form ribbon in the  
next chapter.
 
f
Entity icon: This displays the Icon for Entity Form icon of the entity. It is a 32 x 32 
pixel image and can be updated for an entity. Please refer to the Updating the icon of 
an entity recipe in Chapter 6, Entity Customization, to modify the entity icon displayed 
in entity forms.
 
f
Header and footer: The header and footer are two read-only areas of the form layout. 
These two sections remain static when a user scrolls through the form data displayed 
by the various tabs and sections. So any data that is required to be available to the 
user irrespective of any scrolling, can be included in these sections.
 
f
Form selector: When an entity has multiple forms and the current user's security role 
has access to more than one form, the form selector is displayed. The user can use 
the form selector to choose a form from multiple forms available to them.
 
f
Navigation: This section allows users to navigate to related records of the current 
record. We can add, modify, delete, or reorganize the link to the related entity records 
using the form editor. We can also include links to URLs or web resources by adding 
navigation links using the form editor.
 
f
Form assistant: It helps when we set values for lookup ields. Dynamics CRM 2011 
has introduced improved capabilities to ilter data returned in the lookup dialog. 
Hence, the form assistant is no longer useful; the form assistant has been turned  
off for all except the following three entity forms:
 

Case
 

Product
 

Service activity
 
f
Tabs and sections: Tabs and sections allow grouping and laying out of controls in a 
form. A tab can contain multiple sections. Each form can have a maximum of 100 
tabs. Tabs have a vertical collapse/expand feature.
We will now take a look at the various form-body elements that can be added or associated 
with an entity form:
 
f
Field: Each ield represents an attribute of the entity. A ield can be added to a form 
using the form editor and the form editor allows us to add the same ield multiple 
times in a form. Each instance of a ield in a form is known as a control. The 
appearance and behavior of a control is driven by the type and formatting options of 
the attribute as well as display and formatting properties set on the control, using the 
form editor.

Form and View Customizations
256
 
f
Tab and section: As previously discussed, tabs and sections are used for grouping 
the controls in the form. A tab can contain multiple sections within it. Each tab or 
section can be assigned a name. We can choose to display the name of the tab 
or section on the form or include a separator line at the top of the tab or section, 
underneath the name.
A tab can have one column or two columns; when two columns are speciied, the 
width of each column is a percentage of the width of the tab. A section, on the other 
hand, may have up to four columns and we can control the width available for control 
labels to be displayed in the section as well as how labels for controls in the section 
should be aligned.
 
f
Spacer: The Spacer element provides extra space between ields and controls in the 
form. This is used to improve the control layout in a section.
 
f
Sub-Grid: Sub-Grid allows us to display a list of records, charts, or both.
The first four subgrids can be populated with data in a form when 
it loads. If more than four subgrids exist on a form, the remaining 
subgrids require some user or form script action to retrieve data. 
This is for performance optimization.
 
f
IFRAME: This control provides the HTML iFrame element in the form. Using the 
control, we can host another web page within the Dynamics CRM 2011 entity form. 
The form editor provides the ability to set regular iFrame properties along with 
properties speciic to Dynamics CRM 2011.
 
f
Web Resource: This control displays a form-enabled web resource to be displayed 
on the page. A form-enabled web resource includes a web page (HTML), image (JPG, 
PNG, GIF, ICO), or Silverlight (XAP) resource. The web resource contents are hosted 
within Dynamics CRM 2011.
 
f
Notes: If the entity uses notes and attachments, we can add the Notes control  
into the form. This control can only be added if the entity has Notes enabled in  
the entity deinition.
 
f
Navigation Link: This control is available only within the Navigation section of the 
form. This control allows us to add a link to an external URL or web resource.
How to do it…
In this recipe, we will irst discuss how to create a new main form and then discuss the  
form-customization options. The customization steps can be carried out on any main form.

Making the form non-customizable
In this recipe, we will discuss all the previously stated tasks one after the other. Please follow 
these steps to customize the main form for an entity:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.
3. Then double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. On the expanded Solution page, navigate to Components | Entities |  
<Entity> | Forms.
The next step is to create a new main form; this can be done in two ways. We will discuss both 
of these here:
 
f
Creating an entirely new main form: Go to New | Main Form in the actions toolbar. 
This will create a new form by copying the existing main form. When the new form 
pops up, click on the save button to save the form.

Form and View Customizations
258
 
f
Creating a new form from an existing form: Open the existing form by  
double-clicking on it. When the form launches, click on Save As in the top ribbon. 
When the Save As -- Webpage Dialog window pops up, provide data for the Name 
and Description ields of the new form. Finally, click on the OK button to save the  
new form as shown in the following screenshot:
Any newly created main form will be assigned only to the system 
administrator and system customizer security roles by default. If this 
form is to be used by users having other security roles, assign the form 
to additional security roles by following the Coniguring a form to be 
role-based recipe in this chapter.
To customize a main form, open the form by double-clicking on it in the forms list.
The next step is to discuss the editing of tabs in the form. Tabs are collapsible controls that 
can contain section controls. The following two points will demonstrate adding a new tab and 
editing tab properties:
 
f
Adding a new tab in the form: Click on Body in the form ribbon and then click on the 
Insert tab in the form. In the Insert tab, under the Tab group, select One Column to 
create a one-column tab, or Two Columns to create a two-column tab:
If we add a tab, Dynamics CRM 2011 will automatically add a section for  
each column.

To remove any control in an entity form, use the Delete key 
on the keyboard. Alternatively, the Remove button in the 
ribbon can also be used.
 
f
Editing tab properties: Select the tab control and then click on the Change 
Properties button in the form ribbon. The Tab Properties page will open with the

The navigation area displays entities that are related to the current entity. Each relationship 
has a Label property and in this navigation section this Label property is displayed by default. 
However, the display name for the related entity can be changed. This display name does not 
update the Label property of the relationship. In order to edit the navigation area, perform the 
following steps:
1. Select the Navigation button in the form ribbon.
2. The navigation section will be enabled. Then click on any relationship label and 
select Change Properties to edit the display text. This will bring up the Relationship 
Properties page.
3. Modify the Label ield here.
Next we will edit the form properties; in order to do this, click on the Form Properties button 
in the form ribbon and the Form Properties page will pop up. The following properties can be 
edited there:
Form property
Description
The Event properties
Add or remove the JScript libraries that will be available for

The Non- Event Dependencies properties
Select the fields from the Available fields list that are 
required by any external, non-event scripts, and then click 
on the 
 (add selected records) button to move the 
selected fields to the Dependent fields list. These fields 
will not be removable from the form.

Form and View Customizations
268
Lastly, making a form non-customizable restricts any future customization of the form. 
Therefore, to make a form non-customizable, perform the following steps:
1. Select the Managed Properties button in the form ribbon.
2. The Managed Properties of System Form: Form web page dialog will pop up. In this 
page, mark Customizable as False.
After making any changes to an entity form, the form has to be 
saved and published. Use the Publish button in the form ribbon to 
publish the changes.
How it works…
Web resources and iFrames are not displayed using the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for 
Outlook reading pane, but iFrames are displayed in read-optimized forms. When the Pass 
record object-type code and unique identiier as parameters setting is enabled, iFrames 
allow the form to pass the following contextual parameters to itself:
Parameter name
Description
typename
The name of the entity.
type
This takes in the entity type code, which is an 
integer value to uniquely identify an entity in a 
specific organization.
Id
A GUID that represents a record.
orgname
The organization's name.
userlcid
The user's language code.
orglcid
The organization's language code.
The list of entity type codes can be found at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/
library/gg328086.aspx. The key points about entity type codes are as follows:
 
f
Type codes below 10,000 are reserved for out-of-the-box entities.
 
f
Custom entities will have a type code greater than or equal to 10,000.
 
f
Custom entities' type codes might change during solution import. Hence the  
type codes of a custom entity might be different in the development and  
test environments.
 
f
The entity codes are stored in the Dynamics CRM database and can be retrieved from 
the EntityView table of the <OrganizationName>_MSCRM database.

Controlling form behavior using JScript
Form scripting allows us to perform a variety of actions such as enforcing custom ield 
validation and automation and displaying values for calculated ields within a form in the 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 system. Most of the time, performing actions on data that is 
available on the client side offers better performance than using methods, which require data 
to be saved by the user, and then performing actions on the web server.
Dynamics CRM 2011 forms support scripts written using JScript and can be associated with 
the following two form events:
 
f
OnLoad: This event is triggered when the form is loaded. This event is usually used to 
initialize the form for use.
 
f
OnSave: This event is triggered when a user tries to save the form data. This event 
is usually used for data validation. Scripts associated with this event can cancel the 
save before it is sent back to the server.
Additionally, each ield in a Dynamics CRM 2011 form provides access to the OnChange 
event. This event is triggered whenever a user changes data in the ield or clicks a different 
form element (meaning, the ield loses focus). This event can be used to validate the  
ield data, perform calculations to change other ields, or implement dynamic pick lists  
(drop-down lists).
Update Rollup 12 and December 2012 Service Update (Polaris update) have introduced the 
following exceptions to the behavior of triggering the OnChange event for the Two-Option 
ields that are formatted to use radio buttons or checkboxes:
 
f
If a Two-Option ield is formatted to use radio buttons, the OnChange event occurs 
immediately without requiring that ield to lose focus.
 
f
If a Two-Option ield is formatted to use checkboxes, the OnChange event occurs 
immediately without requiring that ield to lose focus, except when the browser is 
Internet Explorer 7 or 8.
The OnChange event does not ire if the ield value is modiied programmatically using the 
setValue method. To handle this scenario, we can use the fireOnChange method in  
the code.
How to do it…
Please perform the following steps to add scripts in a Dynamics CRM form:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.

Form and View Customizations
270
3. Then double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. In the expanded solution page, navigate to Components | Entities | <Entity> | 
Forms. Double-click on the form where the script is to be used.
5. When the form designer opens up, click on Form Properties in the form ribbon.
6. In the Form Properties dialog, click on the Add button in the actions toolbar of the 
Form Libraries section.
7. 
The Look Up Record view will open up, and from this view the web resources can be 
added to the form library. Select a JScript web resource from the grid, if the JScript 
web resource is already added.
Otherwise, click on the New button present at the bottom-left side of the view to add 
a new web resource. The Web Resource: New page will appear. In this page, provide 
the following information:
Web resource property
Value to be provided
Under the General tab
Name
The schema name of the script-type web resource
Display Name
The display name of the web resource. Optional but 
recommended
Description
Optionally enter some descriptive text about the web resource
Under the Content tab
Type
Select Script (JScript) from the drop-down list
Language
Select the language of the web resource from the drop-down 
list
Uploaded File
Click on the Browse button if you wish to upload the already 
saved JScript file
Then click on the Text Editor button associated with Type. This will bring up the Edit 
Content dialog. Add the JScript methods in the Source section.
8. After adding the JScript to the web resource, click on the Save button in the Web 
Resource: New form ribbon. Thereafter, publish this web resource by clicking the 
Publish button in the ribbon. Finally, close the form.
9. Click on OK in the Look Up Record dialog. Now we can ind the web resource added 
to the form libraries.
10. Below Form Libraries, in the Event Handlers section, choose the following options:
 

Control: Select Form to add a script to form events. Select any form fields to 
add a script to the field event.
 

Event: If the Form control was selected, then we have to select between the 
OnLoad and OnSave events depending on which event we want to add our 
script to.

Chapter 7
271
11. Thereafter, click on the Add button in the Event Handlers section. The Handler 
Properties window will pop up. In the Details tab, provide the following inputs:
 

Library: Select an item from the form library
 

Function: Select the JScript method to be called from the selected library
 

Enabled: Select the Enabled checkbox to make the JScript method available 
to be called by a field event
 

Pass execution context as first parameter: Select this option if the 
execution context is to be passed as the first parameter
 

Comma separated list of parameters that will be passed to the function:  
A comma separated list of parameters to be passed to the JScript method
12. Then, in the Dependencies tab, add the ields using the 
 (add selected  
records) button, which is used by the current script, from the Available ields  
list to Dependent ields.
Up to 50 event handlers per event can be defined. Each handler is 
executed in the order that it is displayed on the Events tab of the 
form element's properties dialog box.
13. Finally, save and publish the form.
14. The script can be tested in three modes of a form: create, update, and read-only.  
In the form designer ribbon, click on Preview and then select Create Form, Update 
Form, or Read-Only Form.
How it works…
Scripts are added to a form or form ields to implement behaviors that are not available out 
of the box with Dynamics CRM 2011. Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 recommends the use 
of the Xrm.Page object model methods to access the form elements. Though for backward 
compatibility Dynamics CRM 2011 still supports crmForm, this support is expected to be 
withdrawn in the next major release of Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
Update Rollup 12 and December 2012 Service Update (Polaris update) support browsers 
other than Internet Explorer. Hence it is required that form scripts should also support 
W3C standards so that the script can also work in other browsers. This requires removal of 
dependencies on HTML components (HTC) that are speciic to Internet Explorer. To identify 
potential issues with custom JScript libraries, Microsoft has released a tool known as 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Custom Code Validation Tool. It is highly recommended to 
validate any custom JScript using this tool before applying them. The tool can be downloaded 
from the following URL:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30151

Form and View Customizations
272
However, to continue support for HTC, Update Rollup 12 and December 2012 Service Update 
(Polaris update) have both introduced an organization-level setting called Include HTC 
support in Microsoft Dynamics CRM Forms. For Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Online 
organizations, the setting is turned "off" by default. But for on-premises organizations, the 
setting is turned "on" by default.
To modify the value of this setting, navigate to Settings | System | System Settings | 
Customization and then select or unselect the Include HTC support in Microsoft  
Dynamics CRM Forms setting.
Enabling HTC support will not allow the newer versions of Internet Explorer to 
provide the best possible performance. Internet Explorer 10 does not support 
HTC components. Support for HTC will be removed in the next major release 
of Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
Modifying Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 application pages or forms using jQuery is not 
supported. The only supported use of jQuery in the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 is the  
use of the jQuery.ajax method to retrieve data from the REST endpoint.
There's more…
In addition to the events discussed in this recipe, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 supports 
two more events:
 
f
TabStateChange: This event is triggered when a tab is expanded or collapsed
 
f
OnReadyStateComplete: This event is triggered when the contents of any iFrame 
have completed loading
Customizing the process-driven form 
(Dynamics CRM 2011 Online only)
In this recipe, we will discuss how to customize the process-driven forms available in Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM 2011 Online.
Getting ready
The process-driven forms introduced in the Polaris update of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 
uses most of the elements described in the standard form. However, there are a few changes 
as shown in the following diagram:

Chapter 7
273
Navigation
Command bar
Business process
Header fields
Subgrids
Auto-save control
Footer
Collaboration controls
Inline edit controls
Entity Display Name
Record Name
The following are the changes introduced in this new type of form:
 
f
Command bar: A process-driven form does not have any ribbon; instead, it has a ixed 
set of commands for each entity and these are known as command bar controls. 
Some important features of command-bar controls are as follows:
 

These controls are record states (Active/Inactive) and are permission-aware 
(security-role access). These commands do not render if the user does not 
have proper permissions and they also display a different set of commands 
in different states.
 

Command controls cannot be extended. Any ribbon customization done will 
not be applied in these process-driven forms.
Read more about ribbon customization in Chapter 8, Site Map 
and Ribbon Customization.
 

Command bar controls are not solution-aware.

Form and View Customizations
274
The command bar provides a Switch to Classic option that displays the record in the 
edit-form mode.
 
f
Header ields: The header ields in this process-driven form are displayed differently, 
but deined in the form in the same way as that of the standard main form.
Unlike a standard form, a process-driven form's header fields 
allow editing.
However, a process-driven form can only display a maximum of 4 ields in the header 
area. Hence, if the header contains more than one row, additional header ields will 
not be visible in this mode. Header ields, being part of the form, are solution-aware.
 
f
Business processes: This is a newly introduced feature in Lead, Opportunity, and 
Case entity forms. These controls cannot be viewed in the form editor. The existing 
business processes can be edited from the process-driven form itself; however, new 
business processes cannot be created. These controls are not solution-aware.
 
f
Inline edit controls: Entity ields added to a process-driven form will be displayed 
in a new way. A ield has to be selected to make it active for edit and thus prevents 
accidental modiications. Inline edit controls are solution-aware. A Bing Map control is 
also added as part of inline edit controls.
 
f
Collaboration controls: Collaboration controls rendered in a process-driven form 
display the following tabs:
 

Posts (Activity Feed/Yammer)
 

Activities
 

Notes
These controls are user-permission-aware and display based on the security role of 
the user.
The form editor will only display the Notes control, which can be removed or added 
to the form. The other two controls are only viewed in the process-driven form and 
cannot be customized.
 
f
Subgrids: The process-driven form displays subgrids with a new lighter look and feel 
and provides some inline editing capabilities. The records in a subgrid can be deleted 
inline. Subgrids are part of the form and hence are solution-aware.
 
f
The auto-save control: The auto-save control appears on the bottom-right corner of 
the form and it automatically saves the record after record creation. Some important 
properties of this control are as follows:
 

After the first edit, the auto-save fires every 30 seconds
 

Auto-save retrieves any changes and displays them in the form without 
reloading it

Chapter 7
275
 

Only data that has been changed since the last save is saved
 

The field currently being edited is not saved
 

Closing the form automatically saves the record
 

Command bar actions such as New, Create, or Qualify also save the record
Each time an auto-save ires, it is actually an update to the record. 
Hence, any worklow or plugin registered against the Update event 
will trigger. Therefore, the worklow or plugin should be developed and 
registered in a way that it is triggered on the changing of some speciic 
ield values and not just on any ield update.
How to do it…
The following controls can be modiied using the same steps as those used during the 
creation of the main form:
 
f
Tabs and sections
 
f

Bing Map
 
f
Lync or Skype
 
f
Yammer

Form and View Customizations
276
In this recipe, we will discuss all the stated tasks one after the other. For process-driven form 
customization, the Form Editor application can also be invoked from the command bar of any 
entity record with the new form.
Please perform the following steps to customize the process-driven form for an entity. Firstly, 
you need to log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
We will now take a look at coniguring the Bing Map display. The Bing Map control displayed in 
the process-driven form is locked in the form and cannot be modiied or removed. The map is 
linked to display Address1 and this setting too cannot be altered.
 
f
We can disable or enable Bing Maps by navigating to Settings | System | 
Administration | System Settings | General and coniguring the Show Bing Maps 
on forms setting.
Process-driven forms support Skype and Lync calls from the Dynamics CRM 2011 form itself, 
using the Click to Call feature:
 
f
To enable the Lync call feature:
1. We have to ensure that the Lync client is installed on the local machine and 
the Lync add-on is enabled in the Internet Explorer. Go to Tools | Manage 
add-ons in Internet Explorer. The following screenshot is what you will see:

Chapter 7
277
2. Then navigate to Settings | System | Administration | System Settings | 
General and set the Select provider for Click to call setting to Lync.
 
f
To enable the Skype call feature:
1. We have to ensure that the Skype client is installed on the local machine. 
Then navigate to Settings | System | Administration | System Settings | 
General.
2. Set the Select provider for Click to call setting to Skype.
If the Lync/Skype add-on recognizes the number format, it inserts a 
telephone icon (for Lync) / Skype icon (for Skype) before the phone 
number. When the add-on is disabled or not installed, a hyperlink on 
the phone number will be visible.
To make calls from Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Online, any phone number must be of the 
<country/region code><area code><number> format. However, during data entry, 
a user may not enter the phone number in the stated format. Hence, Dynamics CRM 2011 
Online provides a system-wide setting to enable country/region code preixing.
This setting can be enabled by navigating to Settings | System | Administration | System 
Settings | General and selecting the Enable country/region code preixing checkbox, and 
then specifying the country/region code, such as +91, in Country/Region Code Preix.

Form and View Customizations
278
This organization-wide setting can be overridden by the user's preferred 
setting. But if a user speciies a different country/region preix in the 
record, it will override the user-level and organization-level preixes.
Lastly, we will look into coniguring Yammer. The Polaris update has introduced Yammer 
integration with Dynamics CRM 2011 Online.
1. To conigure Yammer, navigate to Settings | System | Administration | Yammer 
Coniguration.
2. On the Yammer Disclaimer page, click on Continue.
3. The Yammer coniguration page will appear. If you are already logged into Yammer, 
you will ind the enterprise Yammer network along with the groups already populated. 
Otherwise, we have to log on to Yammer by clicking on the Authorize Microsoft 
Dynamics CRM Online to connect to Yammer link.
4. Select the appropriate Yammer Group ID value and security level as shown in the 
following screenshot:
5. The next screen will display a conirmation message (Congratulations, your system 
is conigured for Yammer!) about the Yammer integration with Dynamics CRM 2011.
6. Thereafter, we have to enable the rule conigurations for Yammer. Navigate to 
Settings | System | Administration | Post Rule Conigurations. Select the rule  
we want to enable and then click on the Enable for Yammer button in the ribbon.
Connecting to Yammer is a one-way process. After the connection 
is established, it cannot be undone.

How it works…
In Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Online, the new process-driven forms will be displayed for 
Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and Case entities irrespective of the read-optimized 
mode setting.
Some of the important features of a process-driven form are as follows:
 
f
Process-driven forms support web resources having the Show this Web Resources in 
Read Optimized form setting enabled.
Except for the Xrm.Page.ui.getFormType method, the Xrm.
Page.ui object is not available in process-driven forms. As a 
performance enhancement, web resources and parts of the Xrm.
Page object model are loaded asynchronously for process-driven 
forms. As a result, if any script in the web resource depends on some 
Xrm.Page objects, such an object may not be available when a script 
runs. In addition, there is no public event to indicate that the parts of 
the Xrm.Page object are available. To counter this, scripts in the web 
resource should implement a strategy to query the Xrm.Page object 
to determine whether the objects to be used are available before 
using them.
 
f
Process-driven forms do not support any type of event handler to be conigured in  
the form deinition. If an event handler is applied to these forms, they will appear  
as edit forms.
 
f
The changes made to a record are saved automatically in process-driven forms.  
This auto-save behavior is not conigurable.
The Click to Call functionality uses the skype: (for a Skype call) and tel: (for a Lync call) 
protocols that enable the direct call functionality for the numbers entered in the out-of-box 
phone number ields in Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online. When a phone number in a  
record is clicked, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 opens Skype or Lync and dials the  
phone number automatically.
Skype and Lync clients and applications are not supported on iPad and other mobile devices. 
For the Click to Call feature, the supported Lync version is Lync 2013/2010 and the Skype 
version is Skype 6.0 or later.
The Yammer integration with Dynamics CRM 2011 is not available with on-premises  
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 installations. Moreover, Yammer and activity feeds  
cannot be used simultaneously.

Form and View Customizations
280
The following are a few important features of the Yammer integration:
 
f
User posts created via the Dynamics CRM 2011 Online user interface are stored in 
Yammer, not in the Dynamics CRM system.
 
f
Auto posts are created and stored in the Dynamics CRM system. Some auto posts are 
also stored in Yammer in addition to Dynamics CRM.
 
f
Users are followed in Yammer only, not within Dynamics CRM.
 
f
Objects other than the user are followed in both Dynamics CRM and Yammer. 
Yammer connection must be enabled before we can follow objects in Yammer.
 
f
If the default Yammer group for users to post from the Dynamics CRM organization 
is deleted in Yammer, the Yammer group association with the Dynamics CRM 
organization has to be changed.
 
f
If the Post to Yammer Activity Stream rule is set to True in Post Rules Coniguration, 
that activity will post to Yammer.
Creating and customizing the mobile form
In this recipe, we will discuss how to create and customize the Mobile Express form. Dynamics 
CRM 2011 allows us to create multiple mobile forms.
How to do it…
In this recipe, we will irst discuss the steps to create a new Mobile Express form and then we 
will discuss the customization options of a Mobile Express form.
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.
3. Then double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. In the expanded solution page, navigate to Components | Entities | <Entity> | Forms.
5. To create a new Mobile Express form, go to New | Mobile Form in the actions toolbar.
6. To customize a mobile form, double-click on the mobile form to be customized. Then 
follow the next steps in either of the previous scenarios.

Chapter 7
281
7. 
The Mobile Entity: <Entity Plural Name> form will appear. Add here the ields 
that should be present in the Mobile form, from the Available Attributes list to the 
Selected Attributes list using the Add and Add All buttons.
The Remove and Remove All buttons can be used to remove a ield from the 
Selected Attributes list to the Available Attributes list. That means we are removing 
the ield from the mobile form.
We can move a ield up or down in the mobile form UI by selecting a ield in the 
Selected Attributes list and then using the Move Up or Move Down button.
Finally, a ield can be marked as read-only in the edit mode of the mobile form  
by selecting the ield in the Selected Attributes list and then clicking on the  
Read Only button.
8. To rename the form, click on the Form Properties button in the actions toolbar  
of the Mobile Entity: <Entity Plural Name> form. This will bring up the Form 
Properties page. Edit the Form Name and Description properties. Click on OK  
to save the changes.
9. Click on Save and Close in the Mobile Entity: <Entity Plural Name> form.
10. Finally, publish the entity.
How it works…
Newly created mobile forms will only be assigned to the system administrator and system 
customizer security role. If this new form has to be used by users having another security 
role, the new mobile form has to be assigned to the relevant security roles by following the 
Coniguring a form to be role based recipe of this chapter.
The Go Mobile privilege under the Business Management tab of a security role deines 
whether the security role has access to mobile forms.
Finally, for any entity to be available in Mobile Express, the Mobile Express setting should be 
in the enabled state for the entity.

282
Coniguring a form to be role-based
Dynamics CRM 2011 supports security-role-based forms. A form can be linked to a single or a 
set of security roles. This recipe will help us understand how to achieve this.
How to do it…
Please perform the following steps to conigure a form to be role-based:
1. Open the unmanaged solution from the solution section.
2. In the expanded solution page, navigate to Components | Entities |  
<Entity> | Forms.
3. Select the form and then click on the Assign Security Roles button for main forms 
and the Assign Role button for mobile forms, from the actions menu:
4. Then a web pop up, Assign Security Roles: <Form Name>, will launch. In this pop 
up, irst select the Display only to these selected security roles option. Thereafter, 
select the security roles this form is to be associated with.
5. Then click on the Enable for fallback option if you want this form to be a fallback 
form for those security roles that do not have any form conigured.

Chapter 7
283
6. Finally, click on the OK button to save the settings.
7. 
To set the Form Order for the available forms, click on the Form Order pop up in the 
actions toolbar and then select Main Form Set.
8. The Form Order pop up will appear. Use the up and down arrows to set the order of 
the forms. Finally, click on the OK button to save the changes.
How it works…
When we have more than one main form deined for an entity, we can select which forms the 
users will be able to see based on their security roles.
Because each entity must be able to display a form for any user, at least one form must be 
designated as a fallback form—a form visible to users whose security roles do not have any 
forms explicitly assigned to them.

Form and View Customizations
284
If an entity has only one main form, the Enable for fallback option cannot be deselected 
from the form. After we create a second main form for the entity, we will be able to clear the 
Enabled for fallback option for one of them. The system will always make sure that at least 
one form is enabled for fallback.
The Form Order pop up speciies the order in which the forms will be displayed to a user if the 
user's security role has access to multiple forms.
Creating and customizing a public view
Entity views are presaved queries to retrieve data by using a speciic ilter and displaying  
those using predeined columns. In this recipe, we will discuss views and how to create a  
new public view.
Getting ready
Every entity in Dynamics CRM can have only six types of views. The following table lists these 
view types:
View type
Description
Number 
of views 
permitted
Action 
permitted
Public view
This view is available to all users. The filter 
criteria, sorting criteria, and columns of the 
existing views can be customized; new public 
views can be created as well.
Zero to 
unlimited
Create, 
Update, 
and Delete
Default public 
view
The default public view is the default view for all 
users when they initially navigate to the entity. 
Any public view can be made as the default 
public view. There has to be one default public 
view.
One
Update

Quick Find view
This view type controls the Quick Find settings 
for the entity. When a user conducts a search 
using the search box in any view, the result view 
will contain the columns of Quick Find view only.
One
Update 
only
Advanced Find 
view
This view is displayed when the user initiates 
a new Advanced Find view for the entity. No 
filter cannot be created for this view. However, 
sorting criteria and columns can be defined for 
this view.

Associated view
This is the view used on related lists when a 
subgrid of items from this entity is visible on 
a parent entity (or on the navigation pane). 
Because the parent entity automatically 
sets the filtering, this view does not allow 
customization of the filter. However, sorting 
criteria and columns can be defined for  
this view.
One
Update 
only
Lookup view
This is the view used on lookup fields on child 
entities of the current entity. The filter for this 
entity cannot be edited, but the columns and 
sorting can be edited. The filter can be edited 
from the form of the child entity.
One
Update 
only
Only public views for an entity can be created and the other view types can only be 
customized. In this recipe, we will igure out how to create a public view for an entity.
How to do it…
There can be multiple public views created for any entity. Dynamics CRM 2011 automatically 
creates a few public views and other types of views for an entity. In this recipe, we will discuss 
how to create and/or customize any public view. The following customization activities will be 
discussed here:
 
f
Editing the ilter criteria
 
f
Modifying the columns of the view
 
f
Rearranging the column order
 
f
Renaming the view
 
f
Making the view the default public view of the entity
Please perform the following steps to create and/or customize any public view:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions and double-click on the 
unmanaged solution to open it.
3. In the expanded solution page, navigate to Components | Entities |  
<Entity> | Views.

13. To conigure the sorting order for the view, click on the Conigure Sorting button in 
the Common Tasks toolbar. The Conigure Sort Order web page will appear. On  
this page, set the sort order for the view and then click on the OK button to save  
the changes.
14. To rename a public view, click on the View Properties button in the Common Tasks 
toolbar. The Provide Information for this view page will appear; modify the Name 
and/or Description ields of the current view and then click on the OK button to save 
the changes.
After performing any of the previous customization steps, save the 
view using the Save and Close button.

15. To make a public view the default public view for an entity, in the entity views select 
the public view to be set as the default public view and then go to More Actions | Set 
Default in the actions toolbar.
16. Finally, we have to publish the entity.
How it works…
Only public views for an entity can be created within Dynamics CRM. Other types of views are 
created by the system automatically and these can be customized to a certain extent. There 
can exist multiple public views for an entity, but only one can be the default public view at any 
point in time.
A public view, like any other type of view, has three important parts:
 
f
Filter criteria: This determines the data that the current view will display
 
f
Columns: This determines what columns of the iltered data will be displayed
 
f
Sorting criteria: This determines the sorting algorithm of the data to be displayed
These three parts deine the data that is displayed by any public view.
Customizing search criteria for the Quick 
Find view
In the Dynamics CRM 2011 system, Quick Find view is used as the search basis for all  
grid-view quick searches, as well as lookup searches within lookups to an entity in other 
forms. In this recipe, we will discuss how to customize the Quick Find view search criteria.

Chapter 7
291
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to add or remove ields according to the search criteria for  
an entity:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with a 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected. Then double-click on the  
unmanaged solution to open it.
3. In the expanded solution page, navigate to Components | Entities |  
<Entity> | Views.
4. Double-click on Quick Find View.
5. When the Quick Find view page opens up, click on the Add Find Columns button in 
the Common Tasks toolbar:

Form and View Customizations
292
6. The Add Find Columns web pop up will appear. On this page, add or remove the 
ields and then click on the OK button to save the changes.
7. 
Then click on the Save and Close button in the view ribbon.
8. Finally, publish the entity.
How it works…
The Quick Find view is used for searching records in an entity grid. By default, the Account 
entity records can be searched using the Account Name and Account Number ields in the 
entity grid. If we try to search account records by City, no records will be displayed in the 
Search Results grid. Now if we add the Address1: City ield in the Quick Find view, we will be 
able to search account records using the City ield in the CRM grid.
Creating a user's personal view
The Dynamics CRM 2011 system allows users to create their personal views in the system. In 
this recipe, we will discuss how to create a personal view.

Chapter 7
293
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to create an Advanced Find view:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system with the credentials of the user who wishes 
to create the personal view.
2. Then click on the Advanced Find button in the top ribbon of the Dynamics CRM 2011 
as shown in the following screenshot:
3. When the Advanced Find view web page appears, select the entity from the Look For 
drop-down list.
4. Then click on the Query button in the ribbon and create the new ilter criteria for the 
Advanced Find view:
5. Optionally, you can click on the Results button to check the result of the view 
deinition and can correct the ilter criteria if required:

Form and View Customizations
294
6. Click on the Advanced Find tab and then click on the Save button in the top ribbon.
7. 
The Provide Information for This View page will appear; provide the name and the 
description of the view and then click on the OK button to save the changes as shown 
in the following screenshot:
8. This view is saved as a personal view now. We can access this view by navigating  
to the Entity link in the Site Map and then clicking on the view's drop-down list.  
The saved views will be listed under the My Views section.

Chapter 7
295
How it works…
Personal views are views accessible only to the user who has created it and users with whom 
this view has been shared by the creator. In Dynamics CRM 2011, views are not security-role-
based. Hence, personal views are useful as these views can be shared with a speciic set of 
users and other users cannot access this view in the system.
Personal views cannot be included in any unmanaged or managed solution. Hence personal 
views cannot be exported from any organization and imported to another organization as part 
of the solution export/import process.
Deactivating or deleting a user's personal 
view
In this recipe, we will discuss how to deactivate or delete a personal view created by a user.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to delete a user's personal view:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system with the credentials of the user who is the 
owner (creator) of the personal view to be deactivated or deleted.
2. Then click on the Advanced Find button in the top ribbon of the main Dynamics  
CRM page.
3. Click on the Saved Views button in the top ribbon.

Form and View Customizations
296
4. In the Saved Views grid, select the saved view to be deactivated or deleted. Then 
click on the Deactivate or Delete Saved View button:
How it works…
Personal views can either be deactivated or deleted if they are not useful anymore. Only 
the owner of the personal view record or the user who has created the personal view can 
deactivate or delete any personal view. Once a personal view is deactivated or deleted, the 
view will be unavailable to all those users to whom the view have been shared.

Introduction to Site Map and Ribbon
Dynamics CRM 2011 includes an application navigation control system called Site Map, which 
allows us to control the application navigation structure. The application navigation is created 
as an in-memory representation of the Site Map. Site Map evaluated together with security 
privileges control the display navigation options in the application. If the security privileges do 
not provide read access to an entity speciied in the Site Map, that navigation option will not 
be displayed.

Site Map and Ribbon Customizations
298
The Site Map is a node in the customizations.xml ile of an exported unmanaged 
solution. We can edit the navigation options by editing the Site Map XML in the 
customization.xml ile. The following customization options are available  
with Site Map:
 
f
Edit Labels: Editing the title or label displayed in the navigation structure
 
f
Add or Change Icon: Adding a new icon or editing an existing icon displayed on  
the Site Map
 
f
Add or Remove Elements: Adding a new element in the navigation structure or 
removing an existing element from it
 
f
Add new pages to an Area: Adding an external page to an area of the application
The following diagram displays the application navigation structure of Dynamics CRM 2011 
Web UI:
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 contains ribbons for the master page as well as for all  
other entity views. The ribbons of the Dynamics CRM 2011 system can be classiied  
as the following:
 
f
Entity ribbon: Dynamics CRM 2011 uses an entity ribbon template for all entities. 
Each system entity has a separate <RibbonDiffXml> deinition that builds upon 
the entity ribbon template deinition.

Chapter 8
299
 
f
Grid ribbon: The grid ribbon is displayed for the entity homepage where a grid is 
displayed with a list of entity records corresponding to the entity view selected.
 
f
Sub-grid ribbon: When a list of records for a different entity is displayed within a  
sub-grid on the form of another entity or in a chart, the ribbon will change when the 
user places the cursor on the grid. This ribbon is known as the sub-grid ribbon.
 
f
Form ribbon: Each entity can have multiple forms. But each of the forms will display 
the form ribbon of the entity.
 
f
Jewel: The jewel is the blue tab with the label File that appears on the far-left side of 
the ribbon. The jewel is also displayed on the entity form.
 
f
Basic home tab: This tab is displayed on the main application ribbon whenever 
an alternative tab is not deined because of entity context or a display rule that 
suppresses it for speciic pages. For example, this tab is displayed when we view the 
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Resource Center.
 
f
Other ribbons: There are several other special-purpose ribbon tabs and a contextual 
group that are deined by Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011. For example, the Advanced 
Find tab, Dashboard Editor tab, Form Editor tab, and Dashboard Homepage tab.
When Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 is accessed within the Microsoft Outlook 2003 or 2007 
versions, the Outlook application does not display any ribbon for Dynamics CRM 2011 pages. 
However, when accessed via the Microsoft Outlook 2010 or 2013 version, Outlook supports 
the Dynamics CRM 2011 ribbon.
The deinition of the ribbon is contained within an XML ile named applicationribbon.
xml. This ile can be exported and viewed but cannot be modiied directly. We can only  
modify the ribbon by deining how we want it to be changed. The changed deinitions can  
be authored as part of the ribbon XML and these changes are applied on the default  
deinition during runtime.
Editing the Site Map
In this recipe, we will discuss how to edit the Site Map to customize the navigation within the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
Getting ready
Site Map has a complex XML structure and to edit it we need to export the XML from the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 system. After editing, we need to import the XML back for the changes 
to take effect. This task requires much care, otherwise the XML structure may get corrupted 
and make the edited Site Map unusable. The XML Schema of the Site Map can be found at 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/gg334271.aspx.

Site Map and Ribbon Customizations
300
To help us in customizing the Site Map, Microsoft Dynamics CRM Lab has released a 
Site Map editor that can be downloaded and used for free. Here we will discuss both the 
alternatives of editing the Site Map. However, the preferred approach would be to edit the  
Site Map using the Site Map editor to minimize the risk of editing the Site Map incorrectly.
Another important thing to remember is to export and save the default Site Map before 
making any changes to it. This is recommended because if the Site Map creates serious  
issues after editing, it can be reverted to the default state.
How to do it...
As part of our Site Map customization, the irst step would be to save the default Site Map. 
Follow these steps to export and save the default Site Map:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with any other 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions. Create a new unmanaged 
solution and open the solution form.
3. Then include the Site Map component by clicking on Add Existing in the  
Actions toolbar.
4. Then click on Save and Close to close the solution.
5. Thereafter, export this solution and save the solution's ZIP ile in a safe location for 
future use.
The next step is to edit the Site Map. As discussed earlier, Site Map can be edited in two ways:
 
f
It can be edited manually
 
f
It can be edited using the SiteMap Editor released by Microsoft Dynamics CRM Lab

Chapter 8
301
Follow these steps to edit the Site Map manually:
1. Navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions. Export the Site Map solution 
created earlier in this recipe as part of saving the default Site Map before editing

2. Now extract the iles from the compressed solution ile. Then open the 
customizations.xml ile from the extracted location using any XML  
editor such as Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.
3. Locate the SiteMap node by going to ImportExportXml/SiteMap/SiteMap. The 
following image displays the SiteMap XML in an exported customizations.xml

Edit the Site Map XML ile as per requirements. After editing, create a new compressed ZIP 
ile, including the extracted solution iles and the edited customizations.xml ile.
1. Then navigate to Settings | Customizations | Solutions. Click on Import and import 
the created ZIP ile.
2. When importing inishes, click on Close.
3. Then publish the solution by clicking on the Publish button.
Microsoft Dynamics CRM Lab has released a Site Map editor that can be downloaded and 
used for free. The SiteMap Editor can be downloaded from the following location: http://
pinpoint.microsoft.com/en-us/applications/microsoft-dynamics-crm-
sitemap-editor-12884928049
After downloading the package, follow these steps to edit the Site Map using the  
SiteMap Editor:
1. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions. Click on Import and import the 
downloaded ile (SiteMapEditormanaged.zip.cab).
2. The preceding step will install the SiteMap Editor in the current Dynamics CRM 
2011 system. To verify the installation, open the solution form by double-clicking 
on the Microsoft Dynamics CRM SiteMap Editor solution by going to Settings | 
Customization | Solutions; then click on Coniguration to load the editor.

Chapter 8
305
We can see that the areas, subareas, and groups are loaded on the navigation pane, 
and the editing pane is on the right-hand side:
3. Using this editor, we can now edit the Site Map of the current CRM organization.  
We will discuss the following three editing options with the SiteMap Editor:
 

Editing Labels (titles and descriptions): To edit the title, uncheck the  
Use Resource ID for Title checkbox.

Site Map and Ribbon Customizations
306
Then click on the New Title button and enter the new title.
In a similar way, to edit the description, uncheck the Use Description 
Resource ID for Description checkbox and then click on New Description 
and enter the descriptive text.
To delete an added title or description, click on the X button on the  
right-hand side of the title/description string.
The LCID or Locale ID is the language ID of the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 system. The value 1033 
refers to English—United States (en-US).
 

Adding an element to the Site Map: To add a new element, we have to first 
select another element at the same level (a sibling) and then click on the + 
button at the bottom of the navigation pane. The new element will be added 
next to the selected sibling. Then provide all the required details for the  
new element.

Chapter 8
307
 

Removing an element from the Site Map: To remove an element, select the 
element and click on the X button on the left-hand side navigation pane. If 
the element is a parent element, this action will also remove all subelements 
under it.
4. After editing the Site Map using the editor, click on the Save button in the left-hand 
side navigation pane. Once the changes are saved, we have to click on the Publish 
All Customizations button of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM SiteMap Editor solution.
How it works…
Site Map is the navigation framework of the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. In this recipe, we 
have discussed how to edit the Site Map. The Site Map is saved as an XML in the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 system and manipulating it manually will be error-prone. Hence utmost care is 
required when manually manipulating it.
When adding an element to the Site Map, we have to ensure that every element has a unique 
ID attribute value; otherwise, the solution import will fail. Before removing an element from 
the Site Map, the best practice is to consider editing the security roles for users to control the 
Site Map.
Preparing for editing the ribbon
In this recipe, we will discuss how to customize the ribbon within the Dynamics  
CRM 2011 system.
Getting ready
To add any changes to the deinition of the ribbon, the irst step is to export the current 
deinition of the ribbon; as a best practice, it is always advised to save the existing ribbon 
deinition before making any changes. The saved ribbon deinition can be helpful for reverting 
to the previous deinition if any modiication is causing serious issues to the system. After 
editing the ribbon deinition, the solution has to be imported back for the changes to be 
applied. Hence, ribbon customization actually has three steps, as follows:
1. Exporting the ribbon deinition as a Solution (this step will be covered in this recipe).
2. Editing the ribbon deinition (this step will be covered in the next recipe,  Adding a 
new button to an existing ribbon group for all entities).

Site Map and Ribbon Customizations
308
3. Importing back the modiied ribbon deinition and applying the changes (this step will 
be covered in the recipe after the next one, Importing the modiied ribbon deinition).
How to do it…
Follow these steps to export the current ribbon deinition from the Dynamics  
CRM 2011 system:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with any other 
relevant security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions. Create a new  
unmanaged solution.
3. After creating the unmanaged solution, if we want to edit the ribbon for the speciic 
entity or entities then click on Add Existing and add the required entity or entities.
For the purpose of editing the entity ribbons, there is no need to 
include the required components; but if we intend to export this 
solution and apply it to another system, we should include the 
required components.

Chapter 8
309
4. If we intend to edit the global ribbon or add a custom group to all entities, we have 
to include the Application Ribbons component to the solution by clicking on Add 
Existing in the Actions menu.
5. Finally, click on Save and Close.
6. Thereafter, export the solution as an unmanaged solution by clicking on the Export 
button in the Solutions actions menu:
7. 
Save the compressed Solution ile.
How it works…
The ribbon deinition has to be exported to edit it. For this purpose, an unmanaged solution 
is created with the existing ribbon deinitions and a copy of this solution has to be preserved 
for any future rollback operation. To prepare the ribbon for editing, we need to extract a copy 
of the exported compressed unmanaged solution ile. The extracted folder will have a ile 
with the name customizations.xml. This ile contains the ribbon deinitions and will be 
edited to include the modiied ribbon deinitions. Post this editing, the solution folder will be 
compressed again and imported back into the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.

Adding a new button to an existing ribbon 
group for all entities
Like the Site Map, the ribbon too can be edited in two ways:
 
f
Editing the ribbon manually
 
f
Editing the ribbon using a ribbon editor. 
There are multiple ribbon editor solutions available at www.codeplex.com. But unlike  
the SiteMap Editor, these ribbon editor tools are an open source tool and not published  
by Microsoft.
Here, we will discuss how to edit the ribbon manually. We will consider a few examples to 
illustrate how to edit the ribbon. Editing a ribbon can be done manually by modifying the 
customization.xml ile of the exported solution.
Getting ready
The following is what we wish to achieve in this recipe:
 
f
Add a button with the title Bing in the form of every entity
 
f
The button should appear in the Process group of the main tab
 
f
When the user clicks on this button, it should launch www.bing.com
The following screenshot shows how the inal output will look:
How to do it…
Follow these steps to add a new button (Bing) to an existing group (Process) for all entities:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with any other 
relevant security role.
2. Export the ribbon Solution as described in the Preparing for editing the ribbon recipe.

Chapter 8
311
3. The image ile for the Bing button has to be added to the default solution before 
adding the ribbon. We will add two PNG images for the new Bing button in the web 
resources of the default solution. Let us name the images as follows:
 

A 16 x 16 pixel PNG file with the web resource name  
packt_icons/Bing16.png
 

A 32 x 32 pixel PNG file with the web resource name  
packt_icons/Bing32.png
4. The next step is to identify the ID of the existing ribbon group with display name 
Process in all entity forms. We can refer to the Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK for 
identifying the ID of the group. The ribbon deinitions are available under the  
SDK\Resources\ExportedRibbonXml location.
The ID value of the Process group controls in the entity forms' main tab is  
Mscrm.Form.{!EntityLogicalName}.MainTab.Workflow

Site Map and Ribbon Customizations
312
The following image shows the Process group ID in the ribbon from the  
SDK\Resources\ExportedRibbonXML ile:
5. Thereafter, decompress or unzip the exported solution ile. Then open the 
customizations.xml ile in an XML editor such as Microsoft Visual Studio.
6. Locate the default RibbonDiffXml node in the customizations.xml ile:
7. 
Edit the <LocLabels> node in the RibbonDiffXml section to deine the button 
name and tool tip.

Chapter 8
313
8. Now we will deine a CommandDefinition element for the new button.
The <Actions> tab deines the action that will happen when the user clicks on the 
button. As we intend to launch a URL, we have deined a URL within the <Actions> 
node. We can use the <Url> node for any kind of URL navigation. We can use a 
relative URL if we want to launch a Dynamics CRM 2011 page URL or an HTML  
page added as a web resource.
We can also execute a JavaScript function when the button is clicked. Add 
the JavaScript as a web resource and then refer to the web resource in the 
Actions node as shown in the following screenshot:
9. Now we will deine the <CustomActions> element for the button. Here, we will 
associate the Labels, Actions, and Icons deined before with the new button. 
With this step, we have completed the new button deinition.

Site Map and Ribbon Customizations
314
10. The inal, modiied RibbonDiffXml node should look like the following code:
<RibbonDiffXml>
  <CustomActions>
    <CustomAction 
Id="Packt.all.form.Bing.CustomAction"                  
Location="Mscrm.Form.{!EntityLogicalName}.MainTab.
Workflow.Controls._children"
           Sequence="30">
      <CommandUIDefinition>
        <Button Id="Packt.{!EntityLogicalName}.form.Bing.Button"
                Command="Packt.form.Bing"
                LabelText="$LocLabels:Packt.all.Bing.LabelText"
                ToolTipTitle="$LocLabels:Packt.all.Bing.LabelText"   
          ToolTipDescription="$LocLabels:Packt.all.Bing.Tool Tip"
                TemplateAlias="o1"
                Image16by16="$webresource:packt_icons/Bing16.png"
               Image32by32="$webresource:packt_icons/Bing32.png"/>
      </CommandUIDefinition>
    </CustomAction>
  </CustomActions>
  <Templates>
    <RibbonTemplates Id="Mscrm.Templates"/>
  </Templates>
  <CommandDefinitions>
    <CommandDefinition Id="Packt.form.Bing">
      <EnableRules />
      <DisplayRules />
      <Actions>
        <Url Address= "http://www.bing.com" />
      </Actions>
    </CommandDefinition>
  </CommandDefinitions>
  <RuleDefinitions>
    <TabDisplayRules />
    <DisplayRules />
    <EnableRules />
  </RuleDefinitions>
  <LocLabels>
    <LocLabel Id="Packt.all.Bing.LabelText">
      <Titles>
        <Title languagecode="1033" description="Bing" />
      </Titles>
    </LocLabel>

Chapter 8
315
    <LocLabel Id="Packt.all.Bing.ToolTip">
      <Titles>
        <Title languagecode="1033" description="Launch Bing 
                              Application." />
      </Titles>
    </LocLabel>
  </LocLabels>
</RibbonDiffXml>
11. Then import the modiied solution by following the Importing the modiied ribbon 
deinition recipe of this chapter.
The inal outcome of this recipe will be a new Bing button added to the Process group of all 
entity forms, as shown in the following screenshot:
How it works…
The new ribbon button is added to all entity forms' ribbons. If we intend to add this same 
button to a speciic entity ribbon form (for example, the Account entity form), the ID of the 
ribbon section is required to be used in the Mscrm.Form.account.MainTab.Workflow 
format. It is clear that we have to replace the {!EntityLogicalName} part with the  
speciic entity name. Ribbon changes will fail if an incorrect ID is used during the new  
button deinition.
In addition, the web resources referred to in the button deinition (PNG images and JScripts) 
have to be present before importing the solution having the new button deinition. Otherwise, 
the solution import will fail.

Adding a new button to an existing ribbon 
group of a speciic entity
In this recipe, we will add a new button to an existing ribbon group for a speciic entity.
Getting ready
The following is what we wish to achieve in this recipe:
 
f
Add a new button (Change Lead Rating) in both the Lead form ribbon as well as the 
Lead grid ribbon
 
f
This button should appear in the Actions group on the right-hand side of the  
Qualify button
 
f
This button should only appear in the web client
 
f
This button should only appear if the record has already been saved
 
f
In the lead grid, this button will only be enabled if just one lead record is selected
 
f
When the user clicks on this button, a custom dialog should pop up
The following screenshot displays the Change Lead Rating button added to the Actions 
ribbon group of the Lead record:

Chapter 8
317
The following screenshot displays the Change Lead Rating button added to the Actions 
ribbon group of the Lead grid ribbon and is enabled when only one record is selected:
How to do it…
Follow these steps to add a new button (Change Lead Rating) as deined in the  
preceding scenario:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with any other 
relevant security role.
2. Create the new custom dialog (Change Lead Rating) that will be launched via the 
custom button.
The Creating a dialog using the Dynamics CRM 2011 web interface recipe can be 
found in Chapter 10, Processes, of this book.
3. Export the ribbon solution as described in the Preparing for editing the ribbon recipe. 
Include the custom dialog and the concerned entity (Lead, in this case) into this 
solution before exporting.
4. Then create the following JScript ile and add it as a web resource to the default 
solution. Name the web resource as packt_scripts/ChangeLeadRating.js.
function LaunchModalDialog(dialogId, typeName, recordId) {
    var serverUrl = Xrm.Page.context.getServerUrl();
    recordId = recordId.replace("{", "");
    recordId = recordId.replace("}", "");
    dialogId = dialogId.replace("{", "");
    dialogId = dialogId.replace("}", "");
    // Load modal dialog
    var serverUri = serverUrl + '/cs/dialog/rundialog.aspx';
    var mypath =   serverUri +

recordId + 
'%7d';
    // First item from selected leads only
    window.showModalDialog(mypath);
    // Reload form.
    window.location.reload(true);
}
The window for creating the JScript ile is shown in the following screenshot:
5. Thereafter, we will add two PNG images for the new Change Lead Rating button in 
the web resources of the default solution. Let us name the images as follows:
 

A 16 x 16 pixel PNG file with the web resource name packt_icons/
LeadRating16.png
 

A 32 x 32 pixel PNG file with the web resource name packt_icons/
LeadRating32.png

Chapter 8
319
The window for adding the PNG iles is shown in the following screenshot:
6. The next step is to identify the ID of the existing ribbon group with display name 
Actions for the Lead form ribbon and the Lead grid ribbon.
 

We can refer to the Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK for identifying the ID of the 
group. The ribbon definitions are available under the SDK\Resources\
ExportedRibbonXml location.
 

The ID of the Actions group for the Lead form ribbon is as follows:
 

The ID of the Actions group for the Lead grid ribbon is as follows:
7. 
Thereafter, decompress the exported solution ile. Then open customizations.
xml in an XML editor such as Microsoft Visual Studio.

Site Map and Ribbon Customizations
320
8. Locate the default RibbonDiffXml node in customizations.xml under the Lead 
entity section as shown in the following screenshot:
9. Edit the <LocLabels> node in the RibbonDiffXml section to deine the button 
name and tool tip.
10. Now we will edit the RuleDefinitions node to deine the display and enable rules 
to support the following requirements, as described in the Getting ready section of 
this recipe:
 

This button should only appear in the web client
 

This button should only appear if the record has already been saved
 

In the Lead grid ribbon, this button will only be enabled if only one Lead 
record is selected

Chapter 8
321
The RuleDefinitions node is shown in the following screenshot:
11. Now we will deine CommandDefinition for the new button. The 
CommandDefinition element for the button in the Lead form ribbon  
will be as follows:

Site Map and Ribbon Customizations
322
The CommandDefinition element for the new button in the Lead grid ribbon will be 
as follows:
The <Actions> tab deines the action that will happen when the user clicks on the 
button. In this example, a JavaScript function with the name LaunchModalDialog 
will be called when the user clicks on the button. We have already deined and  
added this JScript to the web resources. The JavaScript method expects three 
parameters, which are passed to the method using the StringParameter  
and CrmParamater nodes.
12. Finally, we have to deine the CustomActions element for the new button. The 
CustomAction element for the button in the Lead form will be as shown in the 
following screenshot:

In this recipe, we have discussed how to hide an existing ribbon button. The 
HideCustomAction element only removes a speciied node from the ribbon;  
using this approach may not be advisable for every situation.

Site Map and Ribbon Customizations
330
If we intend to hide a button that is associated with a security role, 
we must try to adjust the entity security role to hide the button. If 
we intend to replace an existing ribbon element with a custom one, 
we can overwrite the element by using CustomAction with a 
Location attribute value identical to the existing element.
Importing the modiied ribbon deinition
In the previous recipes, we have learned how to edit the ribbon deinition for various 
scenarios. After editing the ribbon deinition, the modiied ribbon deinition has to be imported 
back to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. This recipe will describe how to achieve this.
How to do it…
Follow these steps to import the modiied ribbon deinition from the Dynamics  
CRM 2011 system:
1. Compress the Solution folder, which contains the iles shown in the following 
screenshot, to a ZIP ile. The customizations.xml ile should contain the  
modiied ribbon deinitions.
2. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or with any other 
relevant security role.
3. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions.
4. Click on the Import button in the Actions menu to import the modiied solution.
5. After importing, we have to publish the changes by selecting the imported solution 
and clicking on the Publish All Customizations button in the Actions menu.

Chapter 8
331
How it works…
After modifying the ribbon deinition, it has to be reimported so that the changes can take 
effect. If the ribbon deinition's modiication is not done with care, then during import the 
modiied ribbon deinition may throw errors or may cause serious issues after solution import. 
In such a case, the exported default ribbon deinition solution can be imported to go back to 
the default state of the ribbon.

Integrating Microsoft SharePoint with Dynamics CRM 2011
Introduction
There is a usual requirement to quickly create documents populated with data from Dynamics 
CRM 2011. Dynamics CRM 2011 supports the creation of predeined templates that can then 
be published to users. Such templates are known as Mail Merge templates and can be used 
to quickly create documents that include information from records in the Dynamics CRM 2011 
system. Using the Mail Merge functionality of Dynamics CRM 2011, we can create Microsoft 
Ofice Word templates for sending letters, faxes, envelopes, and e-mail messages.
Although Dynamics CRM 2011 has the ability to attach a document with records, it does 
not provide a good document management solution. The document versions cannot be 
maintained, documents cannot be searched, and it also takes a lot of manual effort to ind 
the exact document that we were looking for. Integrating Dynamics CRM 2011 with SharePoint 
allows us to use SharePoint as a document management solution.

Creating Mail Merge templates using 
Microsoft Word
In this recipe, we will discuss how to create a Mail Merge template based on Microsoft Word 
that can extract data from a Dynamics CRM 2011 system and create a letter, form, e-mail, fax, 
and so on.
How to do it…
The steps to create a Mail Merge template using Microsoft Word within a Dynamics CRM 2011 
system are as follows:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system as a system administrator or as a relevant 
security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | Business | Templates | Mail Merge Templates.
3. Click on the New button in the Actions menu.
4. On the New page of Mail Merge Templates, provide the following information:
 

Name: This is the name of the Mail Merge template. Use a descriptive name 
that will be easy to understand.
 

Description: This is the description of the Mail Merge template.
 

Associated Entity: This is the entity against which the Mail Merge template 
will be linked.
The creation of a Mail Merge template is enabled only for the following 
business entities: Account, Case, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and 
Quote. For custom entities, the Mail Merge setting can be enabled 
from navigating to General | Communication & Collaboration from 
the entity.
Mail Merge can be used to list the members in a marketing list. On 
opening a marketing list and navigating to the Add tab in the ribbon, 
we will find the Mail Merge on List Members option that can be used 
by Mail Merge to list members.

Chapter 9
335
 

Language: This is the language of the Mail Merge template. The drop-down 
box will only display the languages installed in the Dynamics CRM 2011 
system.
 

Ownership: The ownership of the Mail Merge template record can also be 
selected. By default, the logged-in user will be selected as the template 
owner, which can be changed.
5. Then, click on the Save button in the top ribbon to save the settings.
6. After saving the template, click on the Data Fields button under the Select data 
ields section on the page.

Ofice and SharePoint Integration
336
7. 
This will bring up the Add Columns web dialog with the default ields selected. We 
have to choose the ields/columns we intend to use in the Mail Merge template. We 
can even choose ields from the Related entities. Only the ields included here will be 
available for the Mail Merge template.
8. Then click on the OK button to close the screen. Thereafter, click on the Save button 
in the top ribbon to save the changes.
9. Then click on the Create Template in Word button in the top ribbon.

Chapter 9
337
10. This will prompt us to Open or Save a Microsoft Word document. Click on the Open 
button to open the document. If prompted by Microsoft Word, accept any security 
questions to allow macros and document editing in Word.
11. When the Microsoft Word document opens up, click on the Add-Ins tab and then click 
on the CRM button.
12. Click on the OK button if prompted to conirm the list of recipients.

Ofice and SharePoint Integration
338
13. Now we will be left with a blank document. On the right-hand side of the document, 
there will be a Mail Merge task pane. Click on the Next: Starting document link at 
the bottom of that pane.
14. Click on the Step x of 6 link located at the bottom of the Mail Merge task pane until 
it reaches the Step 4 of 6 stage as follows:

Chapter 9
339
15. Now we can create our Mail Merge template from the blank document. Some pointers 
to develop the Mail Merge template are as follows:
 

We can use Insert Merge Field under the Mailings tab to insert fields from 
Dynamics CRM 2011 into the document.
 

We can use the Address Block and Greeting Line buttons under the 
Mailings tab as well. If we do this, we need to be sure to click on the Match 
Fields button (also in the Mailings tab) first in order to choose the correct 
fields from Dynamics CRM 2011.
Although fields may appear as text based on field names, some field names 
actually contain a unique ID number. Hence, extra care needs to be taken 
when selecting fields.
16. A sample Mail Merge document may look like the following screenshot:

Ofice and SharePoint Integration
340
17. After authoring the template, click on the remaining step links at the bottom of the 
Mail Merge task menu to complete the merge activity. Thereafter, save the Microsoft 
Word document to the local drive and exit from Microsoft Word.
18. Now click on the Browse button under the File Attachment section on the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 page. Then browse the created Mail Merge template and click on the 
Attach button to attach the template to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system.
19. Thereafter, click on the Save button in the top ribbon again to save the changes.
20. Now if we intend to make this Mail Merge template available to the whole 
organization, we need to navigate to Actions | Make Available to Organization  
in the top ribbon.
This will bring up the Make Available to the Organization page. Click on OK to make 
this template available to the organization.

Chapter 9
341
21. Then, click on the Save and Close buttons in the top ribbon to close the Mail Merge 
template page.
22. Now we have to activate the Mail Merge template. We can do this by selecting the 
template and then navigating to More Actions | Activate in the More Actions menu.
23. This will bring up the Conirm Mail Merge Template Activation page. Click on the OK 
button to activate the Mail Merge template.

Ofice and SharePoint Integration
342
How it works…
Mail Merge templates are very useful when a letter or form has to be sent to the customer. 
Mail Merge helps to pull data from the Dynamics CRM 2011 system and populate it into the 
letter automatically. This letter in turn can be sent via e-mail or can be printed as well.
In Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for Outlook, only one Mail Merge process can be run at  
a time; however, we can run multiple Mail Merge processes in the web application at the 
same time.
Microsoft Ofice Word supports up to 64 data ields to be selected for any Mail Merge 
template. If using Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for Outlook, Outlook reserves two data  
ields to store the primary key and the record owner.
Integrating Microsoft SharePoint Server 
(2010/2013) with Dynamics CRM 2011
Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 along with Microsoft SharePoint server provides a very  
strong contextual document management functionality to Dynamics CRM 2011 users.  
This provides enhanced productivity to the Dynamics CRM users. Dynamics CRM 2011  
allows attaching documents to virtually any records and viewing them in the context of a 
Dynamics CRM record.
To use the Document Management functionality with SharePoint, one of the following 
SharePoint editions is required, and must be installed, running, and at least one SharePoint 
site collection conigured and available for Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011:
 
f
Microsoft SharePoint 2013
 
f
Microsoft SharePoint 2010
 
f
Microsoft Ofice SharePoint Server (MOSS) 2007
The user who accesses SharePoint from Dynamics CRM 2011 must have 
appropriate permissions on SharePoint Site Collection where the document 
management functionality components are installed.
Document Management is an out-of-the-box functionality in Dynamics CRM 2011,  
and so once the integration with SharePoint is set up, Dynamics CRM 2011 users  
can easily create, modify, download, and delete documents of SharePoint from the  
Dynamics CRM 2011 interface.

Chapter 9
343
How to do it…
When we install Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011, SharePoint Server integration is enabled 
by default. However, the Dynamics CRM 2011 administrator has to conigure the integration 
between Dynamics CRM 2011 and SharePoint. In this recipe, we will discuss SharePoint 
Server 2010 or 2013 integration with Dynamics CRM 2011.
The following tasks have to be carried out by the Dynamics CRM administrator:
 
f
Install Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 List Component for Microsoft  
SharePoint Server.
 
f
Select the entities in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for which we want to create and 
manage documents on SharePoint Server.
 
f
Specify the URL of a site or site collection on SharePoint Server 2010. This URL is 
used to automatically create folders and document libraries on SharePoint.
The previously mentioned activities have to be done by a user having the System 
Administrator security role in the Dynamics CRM 2011 system. The Dynamics CRM 2011 
administrator user setting up Document Management settings in Dynamics CRM 2011 
requires that the administrator has a minimum of the Read, Design, and Contribute 
permissions to create document libraries in SharePoint.

Ofice and SharePoint Integration
344
We will install Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 List Component for Microsoft SharePoint Server 
by performing the following steps:
1. Navigate to Settings | System | Document Management and click on the Install 
List Component option. This will take us to the Microsoft Download Centre.
2. The download location includes List Components for both SharePoint 2010 and 
SharePoint 2013. Download the appropriate version, navigate to the downloaded 
ile, and then double-click on the ile. If the browser offers to run the downloaded ile, 
select the Run option.
3. In the Setup for Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 SharePointList page, accept the 
Microsoft Software License Terms and then click on Continue.
4. Now we will be prompted to select a folder to store the extracted iles. Select a folder 
and then click on the OK button.
5. Finally, The extraction is complete message will appear. Click on the OK button.
6. The extraction location will contain the following three iles:
 

AllowHtcExtn.ps1
 

crmlistcomponent.wsp
 

mscrmsharepointeula.txt

Chapter 9
345
Now copy these extracted iles to SharePoint Server. To install Microsoft Dynamics 
CRM 2011 List Component on Microsoft SharePoint Server, the user must be a 
SharePoint Site Collection administrator.
Please perform the following steps in SharePoint Server:
1. Start Windows PowerShell from the Start menu in SharePoint Server:
The next two steps (steps 2 and 3) are not required for 
SharePoint Online.
2. In the PowerShell window, change the directory location to the SharePoint 
List Component (the extracted files folder) folder. Thereafter, type the 
following command and press the Enter key:
 
AllowHtcExtn.ps1 http://<server_name>:<port_number>
Replace <server_name> with the SharePoint server name and <port_
number> with the SharePoint port number.

Ofice and SharePoint Integration
346
The Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 List Component on Microsoft SharePoint 
Server uses the legacy .htc iles that are not supported by default in SharePoint. 
So to enable the use of .htc extensions in SharePoint, the AllowHtcExtn.ps1 
command is executed using PowerShell.
1. After this command is executed, we need to reset IIS using the  
iisreset command.
2. Thereafter, browse the SharePoint website. If we are using SharePoint 2010, 
we'll navigate to Site Actions | Site Settings, and if we are using SharePoint 
2013, we'll navigate to the Settings icon in the top-right corner and then 
click on Site Settings.
3. Then for SharePoint 2012, navigate to Galleries | Solutions or for 
SharePoint 2013, navigate to Web Designer Galleries | Solutions.
4. Click on Upload Solution. Then click on Browse and navigate to the 
SharePoint List Component folder we created earlier.
5. Select the crmlistcomponent.wsp file (extracted file folder), and click on 
Open and then on OK.
6. Thereafter, click on Activate. We can see the List Components in the list of 
activated solutions.
The next step would be to enable Document Management for the required entities for which 
Document Management has to be conigured. Document Management can be enabled for 
those entities in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 that can be customized.

Chapter 9
347
By default, Document Management is enabled only for the following entities 
in a new installation of Microsoft Dynamics CRM: Account, KbArticle, Lead, 
Opportunity, Product, and Quote.
Perform the following steps to enable Document Management for entities:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 system with the System Administrator security role.
2. Navigate to Settings | System | Document Management and click on Document 
Management Settings.
3. This will bring up the Document Management Settings window. Select the entities 
for which Document Management has to be enabled and provide the URL of the 
SharePoint site. Then click on the Next button to proceed.

Ofice and SharePoint Integration
348
Document Management settings for an entity have to be 
enabled to make the entity available to the previous Document 
Management Settings window. To enable Document 
Management for an entity, open the Solutions page and 
navigate to Components | Entities | [Entity]. The Document 
Management Settings window can be found under the 
Communication & Collaboration section in the General tab.
4. In the next window, we can deine the folder structure. We have to select an entity 
name from the Based on entity drop-down box as the parent folder.
5. Finally click on the Finish button. This will automatically create folders inside 
SharePoint as follows:

Chapter 9
349
How it works…
This recipe will enable SharePoint-based Document Management with Dynamics CRM 
2011. For the automatic creation of location records on SharePoint Server, we must use 
SharePoint Server 2010 or 2013, and Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 List Component for 
Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010/2013 must be installed on the target server that is running 
SharePoint Server.

Processes
Business processes are a vital part of any CRM software application. Dynamics CRM also 
provides means to create business processes within itself. In addition to this, Dynamics 
CRM 2011 provides a useful software development kit (SDK) for developing extensions and 
custom components to achieve the functionality that the standard behavior of the application 
does not provide. In this chapter, we will delve into some of the recipes that deal with 
automated processes and extensions.
The following recipes will be discussed in this chapter:

Creating a worklow using the Dynamics CRM 2011 web interface
 
f
Creating a dialog using the Dynamics CRM 2011 web interface
 
f
Querying Dynamics CRM data in a dialog
 
f
Monitoring the worklow execution status
Introduction to processes
Dynamics CRM 2011 supports two types of business processes: automated processes, which 
rely on communication among system components; and interactive processes, which rely on 
users to start and run the processes and allow them to make appropriate decisions during the 
execution of the processes.
Processes in Dynamics CRM 2011 are built using Windows Worklow Foundation. Dynamics 
CRM 2011 allows us to create such business processes using the following two components:
 
f
Worklows: These are the automated asynchronous business processes that can be 
initiated either automatically or by a user. Worklows can be created either using the 
Dynamics CRM 2011 Web application or using Microsoft Visual Studio with Windows 
Worklow Foundation and Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK. The second type is usually 
known as custom worklows.

Processes
352
 
f
Dialogs: These are the interactive synchronous business processes that can only be 
initiated by a user. Dialogs are built using a dialog wizard.
Though both worklows and dialogs help us to build business processes within the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 system, there exist some signiicant differences between them. Let us have a look 
at some of these differences:
Workflows
Dialogs
Workflows are asynchronous.
Dialogs are synchronous.
They are either initiated by events or run  
on demand.
They always run on demand.
They  are background processes.
They are wizard-like processes that run in 
the foreground and allows users to make 
appropriate selections during the execution.
They do not require user interaction to finish.
They always require user interaction to finish.
Triggers are supported.
Triggers are not supported.
They can run on multiple records at a time.
They can run on only a single record at a time.
They cannot build interactive queries on  
CRM data.
They can build interactive queries on CRM data.
Dynamics CRM 2011 Online did not support custom worklows until the 
release of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM December 2012 service update 
(Polaris update). The Polaris release has introduced add-ons to create custom 
worklows for Dynamics CRM 2011 Online organizations.
Moreover, up to 200 worklows can be created in a Microsoft Dynamics CRM 
2011 Online service.
Creating a worklow using the Dynamics 
CRM 2011 web interface
In this recipe, we will discuss how to create a worklow using the Dynamics CRM 2011  
web interface.
Getting ready
Before we start creating the worklow, we need to understand a few basic concepts  
about worklows.

Chapter 10
353
Worklow availability – There are three types of worklows that can be made available:
 
f
Automated worklows: Such a worklow is executed as soon as the trigger conditions 
speciied in the worklow logic are met
 
f
On-demand worklows: Such a worklow is available to the user, and the user has to 
apply it to records from a toolbar or menu
 
f
Child worklows: Such a worklow is contained within and executed by another 
worklow, known as the parent worklow
A single worklow can be made available in any combination of these 
three types.
Worklow scope – A worklow can have any of the following scopes:
 
f
User: The worklow will only execute on the records owned by the worklow owner
 
f
Business unit: The worklow will only execute on the records owned by a user within 
the same business unit of the worklow owner
 
f
Parent-child business unit: The worklow will only execute on the records owned  
by a user within the same business unit or in the child business units of the  
worklow owner
 
f
Organization: The worklow will execute on any records.
Worklow logic – Every worklow will have some logic that will determine what kind of action a 
worklow will take on the records. Worklow logic includes the following elements:
 
f
Stage: A worklow stage groups worklow steps. This makes the logic clear and 
readable. However, stages do not affect worklow logic. Worklow stage descriptions 
appear as headings in system job forms, which display the progress of a worklow job. 
Stage descriptions can also appear in reports.
 
f
Step: Worklow steps deine a unit of business logic within a worklow. These steps 
can be conditions, actions, other steps, or a combination of these elements.
The following types of steps can be added to a worklow logic:
 

Check condition: This is a logical if-then statement in a workflow logic.
 

Conditional branch: This is a logical else-if-then statement in a  
workflow logic.
 

Default action: This is a logical else statement in a workflow logic.
 

Wait condition: This enables a workflow to pause itself until the criteria 
defined in the wait condition have been met. The workflow will start  
again automatically.

Processes
354
 

Parallel wait branch: This defines an alternative wait condition with a set 
of additional steps to be executed when the initial criterion is met. This 
prevents workflows from waiting indefinitely until the wait criteria are met.  
It is very useful to create timeout logics in the workflow.
 

Custom step: Such a step has to be created using Dynamics CRM 2011 SDK 
and then can be used in a workflow logic.
 
f
Action – This deines the actions to be performed when a condition is met in a 
worklow logic. The following actions can be included in a worklow logic:
 

Creating a record
 

Updating a record
 

Assigning a record
 

Sending an e-mail notification
 

Starting a child workflow
 

Changing the status of a record
 


Performing a custom workflow action
How to do it…
Please perform the following steps to create a worklow using the Dynamics CRM 2011  
web interface.
First we will have a look at how to create a new process in the web interface:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 organization as a system administrator or a user 
with rights to create worklows.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions if not already selected.
3. Then double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. On the expanded solution page, navigate to Components | Processes.
5. Click on the New button in the actions toolbar.
6. The Create Process web page dialog will open. Fill in the required details in  
this dialog.
 

Provide a relevant process name in the Process name textbox
 

Select the primary entity that we want to use in this workflow from the Entity 
drop-down list

Chapter 10


From the Category list, select Workflow
 

In the Type section, select whether we want to create a completely new 
process or want to re-use an existing template
If we want to view details about the process template, 
select the process template and then click on Properties.
Finally, click on OK to close the web page dialog.
7. 
Thereafter, a web page with Process:< Worklow Name> will appear. In this page,  
we have to set the following worklow properties:
 

If the workflow has to be renamed, provide the new name in the Process 
Name textbox.
 

From the Activate As list, select Process if the workflow is to be activated to 
automate a business process or Process Template if the workflow is to be 
activated as a template.
 

In the Available to Run section, select the workflow availability criteria. We 
can select more than one criterion here from the following:
 

As an on-demand process: Select this if the workflow has to be executed on 
an on-demand basis by a user.
 

As a child process: Select this if the workflow is to be available as a  
child workflow.

Processes
356
 

In the Scope drop-down list, select the access level that matches the 
workflow scope to be set.
The items available in the list depend on the privileges that have been 
assigned to the user's security role for the worklow's primary entity.
 

In the Start when section, select the events that will trigger the workflow 
execution. The following events are available:
 

Record is created: We'll select this option if we want to start the workflow 
when a record of the workflow's primary entity is created.
 

Record status changes: We'll select this option if we want to start the 
workflow when the status of a primary entity record changes, for example 
from Active to Inactive.
 

Record is assigned: We'll select this option if we want to start the workflow 
when a primary entity record is assigned to a user or a team.
 

Record fields change: We'll select this option if we want to start the 
workflow when the value of one or more fields of the primary entity  
record changes.
 

Record is deleted: We'll select this option if we want to start the workflow 
when a record of the primary entity is deleted.
8. If Record ields change is selected, speciic ields of the primary entity are required 
to be set by clicking on the Select button associated beside this option. After making 
the selection, click on the OK button to close the web page:

Chapter 10

Next we will add the worklow logic. We can add the worklow stages, steps, and actions 
in any order, but they have to be combined sequentially depending on the worklow logic 
intended to be built.
 
f
Worklow stage:
1. Click on the Add Step tab and then select the Stage option in the workflow 
logic toolbar as shown in the following screenshot:
2. Click on OK in the message box that pops up.
3. Then enter a stage description.
4. If a stage is added to a workflow, all the steps must be contained within  
a stage.

Processes
358
 
f
Worklow step:
1. Click on the Add Step option in the workflow logic toolbar and then select 
one of the following options: Check Condition or Wait Condition.
These options can be added at any level of the 
workflow logic.
2. If the check condition is added to a workflow logic, either Conditional 
Branch or Default Action can be added to the parent step. To add either 
of these options to the workflow logic, we must select the If line in a check 
condition or the Otherwise, if line in a conditional branch.
 It is not possible to create more than six levels 
of conditional branching.
3. In case a wait condition is added to a workflow logic, the Parallel Wait 
Branch step can be added to the parent step.
4. Once the workflow steps are added, click on <condition> (click to 
configure). The Specify Condition web dialog will pop up. In this page, 
specify the conditions for the step. Repeat the following steps to add  
multiple conditions.
5. In the first column, select either the primary entity or the related entity.
6. In the second column, select a field from the entity selected in the  
previous step.
7. 
In the third column, select a logical operator.
8. In the last column, enter the values that we want to use as the criteria  
for the condition.
9. Once all the conditions are added, click on Save and Close.

Worklow action:
1. Click on the Add Step option in the workflow logic toolbar and then select 
one of the following options:
 

Create a record
 

Update a record
 

Assign a record
 

Send an e-mail notification
 

Start a child workflow
 

Change the status of a record
 

Stop the current workflow
2. Then enter the description for the step.
3. If a Set Properties button appears next to the newly added action, click 
on Set Properties and specify details about the entity that this step in the 
workflow is taking action on.
4. After creating a workflow, we have to activate it. If activated workflows are 
not available for use, click on the Save button in the top toolbar to save the 
workflow first and then click on the Activate button to activate it. Click on OK 
when the confirmation dialog pops up.
Once activated, the worklow properties and logic are read-only. To edit 
these, we have to deactivate the worklow using the Deactivate button  
in the top toolbar.

A worklow having stage, step, and action would look like this:
How it works…
Worklows are very useful tools for building business process within the Dynamics CRM 2011 
system. In this recipe, we have discussed the building blocks of a worklow. Using these 
elements of a worklow, complex worklows can be built.
There are a few important things to remember when building a worklow. Worklow logic built 
using stage, step, and action cannot be easily restructured, and most of the time we have to 
delete the worklow and recreate it when such a necessity arises. Hence, you have to think 
carefully before starting to create the stages and steps of a worklow.
Another important thing is that if we use a wait condition to wait for a timeout in the worklow 
logic, we cannot change the timeout condition. We have to delete the condition and then add 
a new condition.
If worklows are not activated, they are unavailable for use.
Worklows can be backed up and transferred from one organization to another using 
Dynamics CRM 2011 Solution.
If we want to remove the completed worklows from system jobs, we can make 
use of the Automatically delete completed worklow jobs (to save disk 
space) feature of Dynamics CRM 2011. This feature can be selected from 
the Administration tab in the worklow. By selecting this option, we can save 
some disk space.

Creating a dialog using the Dynamics CRM 
2011 web interface
In this recipe, we will delve into how to create a dialog using the Dynamics CRM 2011  
web interface.
Getting ready
Before we start the dialog creation recipe, let us irst discuss some basic concepts around  
a dialog.
Dialog availability – There are two types of dialog that can be made available:
 
f
On-demand dialog: Such a dialog is initiated by a user on a CRM record
 
f
Child dialog: Such a dialog only starts from within another dialog
A single dialog can be made available in any combination of 
these two types.
Input arguments and variables – A dialog uses input arguments and variables to store and 
pass on data to another dialog.
 
f
Input arguments: Input arguments are used only in child dialogs to pass on data to 
the parent dialog. Input arguments can be of the following types:
 

Text
 

Integer
 

Float
 

Date and Time
 

Date only
 

Lookup

Processes
362
 
f
Variables: A variable stores data that can be accessed later on from the steps in the 
dialog. Variables are also of the same data types as those of input arguments.
 
f
Variables in dialogs have a global scope and can be 
accessed for any step in the dialog
 
f
Variables can be used as data slugs in the workflow logic 
for different action steps in the dialog
 
f
Variables can be used to maintain a running counter for 
determining a score based on responses in prompt and 
response steps
 
f
Variables can also be used for computational values that 
can be used in a dialog by using the assign value step
Dialog logic – Dialog logic can be built using the following elements:
 
f
Stages: Like worklow stages, dialog stages also group the dialog pages and  
steps. This makes the logic clear and readable. However, stages do not affect  
the dialog logic.
 
f
Pages: A page offers a visual interface to the dialog and is the basic unit of a dialog. 
A dialog can have more than one page, and every page can have multiple prompts 
and responses. When a dialog is run, the pages appear in the same sequence in 
which they are deined in a dialog.
We must add at least one page in a dialog.
 
f
Prompt and response steps: They allow for the user to be questioned and gather 
responses. For any prompt, the following types of responses can be deined in  
a dialog:
 

None: No response is required for this prompt
 

Single Line: This provides the user with a textbox with a length of  
255 characters
 

Multiple Line of Text (Text Only): This provides the user with a textbox to 
enter multiple lines of text
 

Option Set (radio buttons): This provides the user with a set of radio-button-
based options with a predefined set of choices or from data returned by a 
CRM Query Data step
 

Option Set (picklist): This provides the user with drop-down list based 
options with a predefined set of choices or from data returned by a CRM 
Query Data step

Chapter 10
363
 

Date and Time: This provides the user with a calendar and a drop-down list 
to select a date and time from
 

Date Only: This provides the user with a calendar to select a date from
 

Lookup: This provides the user with an option to select a related record using 
the lookup field
We can also insert hyperlinks in the prompt or tip text or in an e-mail created using 
the Send E-mail action to provide the dialog users with a link to external content,  
any existing CRM records, or any CRM records that are created during the current 
dialog session.
We must add at least one prompt and response 
in a dialog.
 
f
Worklow logic: A dialog can also use worklow logic elements. The following worklow 
logic elements can be used in a dialog:
 

The check condition step
 

Actions that include the following:
 

Query CRM Data
 

Assign Value
 

Create Record
 

Update Record
 

Assign Record
 

Send E-mail

Link Child Dialog
 

Start Child workflow

Custom workflow actions
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to create a dialog using the Dynamics CRM 2011 web interface:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 organization as a system administrator or a user 
with rights to create dialogs.
2. Navigate to Settings | Customization | Solutions and change the view to 
Unmanaged Solutions, if not already selected.

Processes
364
3. Then, double-click on the unmanaged solution to open it.
4. On the expanded solution page, navigate to Components | Processes.
5. Click on the New button in the actions toolbar.
6. The Create Process web page dialog will open. Fill in the required details  
in this dialog:
 

Provide a relevant process name in the Process name textbox
 

Select the primary entity that we want to use in this dialog from the  
Entity drop-down list
 

In the Category list, select Dialog
 

In the Type section, select whether we want to create a completely new 
process or re-use an existing template
If we want to view details about the process template, select the process 
template and then click on Properties.
Finally, click on OK to close the web page dialog.
7. 
Thereafter, a Process:< Dialog Name> web page will appear. In this page, we have to 
set the dialog properties.
 

If the dialog has to be renamed, provide the new name in the Process  
Name textbox.

Chapter 10
365
 

From the Activate As list, select Process (if the dialog is to be activated to 
automate a business process) or Process Template (if the dialog is to be 
activated as a template).
 

In the Available to Run section, select the dialog availability criteria.  
We can select more than one criterion here from the following:
 

As an on-demand process: If the dialog has to be executed on an  
on-demand basis by a user
 

As a child process: If the dialog is to be available as a child dialog
By default the As an on-demand process option is already selected.
8. Let us now ind out how to add variables in a dialog. Variables are added to store data 
within a dialog, to be used later. To do so, click on the Add button in the Variables 
section. This will launch the Add or Modify Properties page:
9. Furnish the following details in this page:
 

Name: Insert a unique name for the variable. The name should be clear 
enough so that the variable can be easily identifiable later when we want  
to use it in the dialog.

Processes
366
 

Data Type: Select the data type of the variable from the following available 
data types:
Data type
Description
Text
Stores alphanumeric values
Integer
Stores numeric values
Float
Stores floating numeric values
Date and Time
A calendar and option set control used for storing date and 
time values
Date Only
A calendar and option set control used for storing date values
Lookup
A relationship field used for selecting a related record
Other than the Lookup ields, for every other data type in the Default Value textbox, 
we must enter a default value of the variable as per the data type.
For the Lookup ields, we must select a reference entity and a reference ield.  
This combination determines the entities the variable can refer to.
Each entity related to the reference ield of the selected reference entity is added in 
the dialog form as a local value in the irst drop-down list under Look for. The ields of 
these related entities can be added as dynamic entities in the steps of the dialog.
For example, if we select the Lead entity and Customer as Reference Entity and 
Reference Field respectively, the entity drop-down list under Look for will include 
Account and Contact. This is because the Customer ield of the Lead entity is related 
to both the Account and the Contact records. The ields for the local values of Account 
and Contact can be used as dynamic values in the next steps.
10. Finally, to save the changes click on the OK button.
11. If we are designing a child dialog, we can add an input argument in the dialog. Input 
arguments can only be added to a child dialog.

Chapter 10
367
An input argument is added in the same way that a variable was added in the last 
step of this recipe. The only difference is that to add an input argument, we have to 
click on the Add button of the Input Arguments area and not of the Variables area as 
shown in the following screenshot:
12. After learning how to add variables / input arguments, now it is time to check how 
to add stages in a dialog. A stage in a dialog is added in the same way as it is added 
to a worklow. First we need to click on the Add Step tab and then select the Stage 
option in the process toolbar as shown in the following screenshot:
13. Click on OK in the message box that pops up.
14. Then enter a stage description.
15. The next element of a dialog is a page. To add a page in the dialog, under the steps 
click on the section where we want to add the page.
16. Then click on Add Step in the process logic toolbar and select Page.
17. Finally, we have to enter a page description.

Processes
368
18. Once a page is added, a Prompt and Response element can be added to it. To add 
a prompt and response step in a dialog, we need to select the line where we want to 
add a prompt and response, then click on Add Step in the process logic toolbar, and 
select Prompt and Response as shown in the following screenshot:
19. Under the steps, click on Set Properties.
20. The Deine Prompt and Response page will appear. Provide the following details on 
this page:
 

Under the Prompt Details section:
Provide a question or instructions for the prompt in the Prompt Text area.
Provide an optional tip to help clarify the prompt in the Tip Text area.

For the Data Type setting for the Single Line, Option Set (radio buttons),  
or Option Set (picklist) response type, we can select any of the following 
data types:
 

Text
 

Integer
 

Float

Chapter 10
369
For the Default Value setting, an optional default value can be provided for 
the Single Line, Multiple Lines (Text Only), Date and Time, or Date Only 
response type.
For the Lookup response type, we need to select a reference entity and a 
reference ield.
Finally, for option set response types select any of the following for  
Provide Values:
 

Define Values: This enables us to define our own values to  
the response
 

Query CRM Data: This enables us to provide values from a record  
in Dynamics CRM
Select Log Response if you want to log the response so that it can be used 
in another place in the dialog
21. Then click on Save and Close.
22. The next element that can be included in a dialog logic is a conditional step. A 
conditional step can be added to the dialog in the same way it is done for worklows. 
Please refer to step 10 of the Creating a worklow using the Dynamics CRM 2011 
web interface recipe.

Processes

23. The inal element that can be added to a dialog is an action. To add an action to a 
dialog, under Steps click where we want to add the action.
Then click on Add Step and select any of the following actions from the process  
logic toolbar:
 

Query CRM Data
 

Assign Value
 

Create Record
 

Update Record
 

Assign Record
 

Send E-mail
 

Start Child Workflow
 

Link Child Dialog
 

Change Status
 

Stop Dialog
Then enter an action description.
If a Set Properties button appears next to the newly added action, click on Set 
Properties and specify details about the entity that this step in the dialog is taking 
action on.
24. Like worklows, after a dialog creation we have to activate it. Dialogs are not available 
for use unless activated. Please click on the Save button irst in the top toolbar to 
save the dialog, and then click on the Activate button to activate it. Click on OK  
when the conirmation dialog pops up.
Once activated, the dialog properties and logic are read-only. To edit these, we have 
to deactivate the dialog using the Deactivate button in the top toolbar.
How it works…
A dialog is a type of process in Dynamics CRM 2011 that displays the input forms and data 
that a user needs at each step while interacting with a customer or following a process that 
requires user input. A dialog is a very powerful tool to have branching logic that is based on 
input from the person stepping through a case, phone call, or any other customer interaction.
A dialog can only be run through the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 web application  
and is not supported in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 for Microsoft Ofice Outlook with 
ofline access.

Chapter 10
371
After developing a dialog, the dialog can be accessed via the following URL:
http://CRMServer_Name/Org_Name/cs/dialog/rundialog.aspx?DialogId=Dial
ogID&EntityName=EntityLogicalName&ObjectId=EntityObjectId
Here we will see the following:
 
f
CRMServer_Name is the name of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM server
 
f
Org_Name is the organization name
 
f
DialogID is GUID of the dialog that we want to run
 
f
EntityLogicalName is the entity logical name of the primary entity of the dialog 
that we want to run
 
f
EntityObjectId is the GUID of the primary entity record
We might try to split a complex dialog into child dialogs and invoke all of those 
child dialogs from a parent dialog. However, that is not supported.
Querying Dynamics CRM data in a dialog
In this recipe, we will ind out how to retrieve Dynamics CRM data and use them in a dialog.
Getting ready
Sometimes, in the Prompt and Response section we would like the user to select a response 
from existing CRM data. Here we will discuss how we can retrieve CRM data and display them 
in a dialog.
There are two basic ways to achieve this: one using the Lookup variables in a dialog and the 
other using the Query CRM Data action. Let us have a look at both the approaches here.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to query CRM data and display the data in a dialog:
1. Open the dialog designer page where CRM data has to be queried.
Now, we will delve into both the approaches of retrieving CRM data one by one.  
First, we will ind out how to query CRM data using a lookup ield.
2. To conigure a Lookup response type in the Prompt and Response page, we have to 
provide a reference entity and the reference ield.

Processes
372
Let us take an example here. Assume that we want to provide a lookup to a user 
to select from existing accounts to associate it with a lead record in a dialog. The 
following screenshot displays the Prompt and Response page coniguration for  
this example:
.
We can observe that the Reference Field drop-down box shows only 
those fields that are a parent of the Lead entity type. Hence, using 
this method we can query only the parent entity records in a dialog.
3. The following screenshot illustrates the user experience when the dialog runs:

Chapter 10
373
4. Let us now discuss how to query CRM data using the Query CRM Data action. To use 
this action, let us take an example of allowing a dialog user to select a Contact whose 
City is already selected by the user in a previous step in the dialog.
5. The next step is to add a variable (City) to store the user-provided city. The following 
screenshot displays how that can be done:
6. Then, add a prompt and response for requesting the user to enter the city 
information. A default value is selected as the default value of the added  
City variable.
7. 
Then, we have to assign the user-provided city to the City variable, after which we 
have to add an assign value action to the dialog:

Processes
374
8. Thereafter, we have to add and deine the Query CRM Data action. In the dialog, we 
would use the user-provided city information as shown in the following screenshot:
9. Then, add a check condition to ind whether the previously added Query CRM Data 
Fetch XML query has returned the data or not:
 
10. If the data has been returned, we will add a prompt and response to allow the user to 
select a Contact record matching the selected city information:

Chapter 10
375
11. The inal dialog steps look like the following screenshot:

Processes
376
How it works…
In this recipe, we have discussed two ways to query the CRM data to be used in a dialog.  
Both ways have their own pros and cons. The following table compares the two approaches:
The Lookup field
The Query CRM data action
The user can search records on any 
columns included as view columns in the 
quick find view.
This approach presents the user with an option 
set populated with data returned by the query.  
The user cannot search records.
The user can sort the records.
The user cannot sort the records.
The user has access to all the records of 
the response field via the available views.
The user can only access the records returned by 
the query.
This approach can only use the lookup 
view defined for the entity; a filtered list 
to perform the lookup against cannot be 
provided.
A filtered list can be provided using the Fetch XML 
query.
Navigation around hundreds of records 
is relatively easy using the out-of-the-box 
entity view grid.
As data is displayed using option sets, navigation 
around hundreds of records is difficult.
With these comparative differences, the lookup ield approach should be used 
when we want users to be able to search and select a record interactively. On 
the other hand, the query CRM data approach should be used when we want 
to provide users with more structured data to select from.
Monitoring the worklow execution status
In this recipe, we will delve into monitoring the status of a worklow execution. The following 
section will brief you on the the need and source of the worklow execution status.

Chapter 10
377
Getting ready
The need to know the execution status of a worklow is very important. As worklows are 
asynchronous in nature, they do not execute when they are run; rather, worklows are queued 
up and run in an asynchronous nature. The status of worklow execution can be determined 
from system jobs.
How to do it…
Perform the following steps to determine the status of a worklow execution:
1. Log in to the Dynamics CRM 2011 organization as a system administrator or a user 
with appropriate rights on the System Jobs entity.
2. Navigate to Settings | System | System Jobs.
3. The System Job views will list every record of the type System Job, including worklows.
4. To ilter the worklow records, click on the More Actions tab in the actions toolbar as 
shown in the following screenshot:

Processes
378
5. Then, a drop-down icon will appear against all the columns in the current view. Click 
on the icon next to System Jobs Type, and then select only Worklow and click on OK 
to apply the ilter as shown in the following screenshot:
6. Once the worklows are iltered, check the Status Reason column. This column will 
tell us the status of the worklows. We can apply a ilter to this column using the 
previous step.
7. 
The following actions can be performed on a Worklow system job:
 

Cancel
 

Resume
 

Postpone
 

Pause

Chapter 10
379
To perform any of these actions on a worklow, select the worklow from the list and 
then click on More Actions in the actions toolbar. Then select any one of the actions 
as shown in the following screenshot:
How it works…
If there is a problem with a worklow, it can be canceled, postponed, paused, or resumed. 
However, there are a few restrictions around this.
A canceled worklow cannot be resumed.
No action can be applied on a worklow that has been successfully completed.
Each time a worklow rule is triggered, a system job is created. These jobs carry a status, and 
when a failure is experienced, they are stamped with an error code and an error message and 
are set to a Waiting status.
A worklow with a wait condition can also be displaying the status Waiting. But unless the 
system job is stamped with an error message, all waiting worklows may not have an error.
If a system job fails, the details about which steps failed and what the 
problems may have been can be viewed as well. To do so, at irst the 
system job record has to be opened. To display details about system job 
failures, the cursor has to be moved over the warning symbols.
To view system job failures in a format that can be printed or copied and 
pasted, click on the Print button.

Processes
380
There could be a number of reasons why Dynamics CRM worklow instances fail to complete. 
It is important to regularly check for failed worklows to ensure the integrity of the system.
A failed worklow instance can indicate:
 
f
A worklow rule operating under a user context that has insuficient  
permissions assigned
 
f
A badly written worklow logic
 
f
Environmental issues / timeouts / system errors
 
f
Asynchronous service-related issues
